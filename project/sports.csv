Team India are set to pocket a record-breaking sum from the International Cricket Council (ICC) following their historic victory in the Women’s World Cup 2025 final against South Africa at the DY Patil Stadium on Sunday.With the win, India not only lifted their maiden Women’s World Cup title but also secured the highest-ever prize money in the history of cricket - a whopping USD 4.48 million (Rs 39.78 crore).The amount is part of a total tournament pool of USD 13.88 million (about Rs 123 crore), which was announced by the ICC ahead of the event. This was a whopping 297 per cent increase from the USD 3.5 million purse at the 2022 edition in New Zealand.The winners’ prize of USD 4.48 million represents a 239 per cent jump from the USD 1.32 million that Australia received for winning the last edition, while runners-up South Africa will earn USD 2.24 million (Rs 19.88 crore).Each losing semi-finalist is entitled to USD 1.12 million (Rs 9.94 crore), while all eight teams were guaranteed USD 250,000 for participation, plus an additional USD 34,314 for every group-stage win.According to a PTI report, the BCCI is also considering matching the prize and bonuses that the men’s team received after their T20 World Cup 2024 win.A senior BCCI source told PTI, “The BCCI supports equal pay for men and women and hence there are lot of discussions that if our girls win the World Cup, the reward won't be anything less compared to the men's global triumph. But it isn't nice to make an announcement before they win the Cup.”The Rohit Sharma-led men’s team was awarded ₹125 crore for their T20 World Cup victory last year, a figure that could now serve as a benchmark for the women’s side following their landmark success.As the celebrations continue in Navi Mumbai, India’s triumph, and the record prize it brings marks a defining moment for women’s cricket and reflects the ICC’s stated goal of “a world-class Women’s Cricket World Cup” and “a clear commitment to long-term growth.”The final saw Team India women defeat Laura Wolvaardt's South Africa by 52 runs in Navi Mumbai.","India women secured a historic win at DY Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai to secure a record sum in prize money from the ICC.

Mokama Murder Case: JD(U) Candidate Anant Singh Arrested Over Killing of Jan Suraaj Worker

From allies to arch-rivals

The killing that reignited the faultlines



The caste arithmetic in Mokama

Bhumihars: Around 55,000–60,000

Yadavs: Around 40,000

Dhanuks (Koeris): Around 45,000

Muslims and Dalits: Together account for roughly 30 per cent of the electorate.

Verdict to echo beyond boundaries

NEW DELHI: The murder of 76-year-old Dularchand Yadav while he was campaigning for a Jan Suraaj candidate has ruptured a long-smouldering local equilibrium in Mokama, turning what should have been a routine assembly fight into a high-stakes prestige battle between two bahubali figures and the caste blocs that back them.The Mokama battle is centred around two powerful strongmen from the influential Bhumihar caste: Anant Singh , akaof JD(U) and Surajbhan Singh, who is aligned with RJD.What was shaping up to be a familiar, muscle-driven election in Mokama has now turned into a prestige battle with caste loyalties, community pride, and the question of law and order hanging in the balance.To understand the intensity of Mokama’s politics, one must go back two decades to a time when the Singh brothers of Barh and Mokama defined the region’s power matrix. Anant Kumar Singh, once a close aide of Nitish Kumar , rose rapidly in the early 2000s as the enforcer of the JD(U)’s presence in the Bhumihar belt. Known for his flamboyant persona, blunt speech, and a knack for dispensing justice outside the system, Anant became both feared and adored -- the archetypal bahubali of central Bihar.On the other hand, Surajbhan Singh, hailing from the nearby Begusarai–Barh area, was cut from the same cloth -- a Bhumihar strongman who turned to politics after a string of criminal cases.Aligned first with the LJP under Ram Vilas Paswan and later seen close to the RJD ecosystem, Surajbhan represented the rival pole of Bhumihar assertion. Their rivalry was not just personal. It was territorial and symbolic.Both commanded loyalty among the Bhumihars, both controlled local networks of influence, and both saw themselves as the natural claimant to the region’s political crown.In the early 2000s, there were phases when the two operated within the same broader political alliance. But as Nitish Kumar consolidated power in 2005, Anant Singh emerged as the JD(U)’s uncontested strongman, while Surajbhan’s camp drifted toward the LJP-RJD axis.Anant Singh's political rise, from muscleman to MLA, coincided with Surajbhan's declining electoral influence due to criminal convictions. Yet, the latter's family continued to retain sway over nearby constituencies through his wife, Veena Devi.Over the years, the rivalry took violent turns as their supporters clashed over land control, local contracts, and political dominance.Mokama, Barh, and adjoining areas became a microcosm of Bihar’s bahubali politics, where muscle met caste mobilisation and the rule of law often bent to the weight of reputation.The murder of Dularchand Yadav on Thursday has revived the darker shades of that rivalry. Yadav, a campaigner for Jan Suraaj, was reportedly attacked while mobilising support for the party’s candidate in a region where Yadav and Dhanuk voters are crucial swing blocs.Police have arrested Anant Singh in connection with the killing, prompting a wave of outrage from opposition ranks and a renewed debate over Bihar’s law and order under Nitish Kumar.For the ruling camp, it’s an embarrassment to have a high-profile candidate in custody during an election campaign. For the opposition, it is less a moral crusade than a political opening and a chance to highlight administrative ""lapses"", question Nitish Kumar's control over his own strongmen, and mobilise discontent in a constituency long defined by muscle and loyalty rather than party lines.However, reacting to Anant Singh's arrest, the ruling NDA has maintained that, unlike the Lalu regime, no leader can have immunity from legal action.According to the latest electoral roll (as of January 2024), Mokama has about 2.9 lakh registered voters. The constituency’s caste composition is sharply layered:In the 2020 Bihar Assembly election, Anant Kumar Singh, contesting as an Independent, secured 78,721 votes, which was about 53 per cent of all valid votes cast in Mokama. The victory affirmed his influence among sections of the Bhumihar community, which forms a significant part of the constituency’s voter base.This time, however, the equations appear more fluid. The killing of a Jan Suraaj worker belonging to the Yadav community has introduced an unpredictable element into the contest.It is believed the incident could influence voter sentiment, particularly among backward caste groups such as Yadavs and Dhanuks, who together make up nearly 30 per cent of the electorate.At the same time, the Bhumihar vote, which has largely remained cohesive in previous elections, may witness some degree of division given the presence of more than one influential leader from within the community.With both Anant Singh and Surajbhan Singh commanding their own networks, political observers say a section of forward-caste voters could align differently this time.In a constituency with fewer than three lakh electors, even a 5–10 per cent shift in turnout or community alignment is equivalent to about 15,000–25,000 votes, which could significantly affect the final outcome.If Anant Singh wins, it will restate that the Bahubali era in Bihar has not ended -- it has merely evolved. The forms may have changed, but the substance of power remains rooted in personality, caste pride, and the defiant cult of local strongmen.For Nitish Kumar, a victory under such a shadow would still signal control, proof that his political arithmetic can withstand scandal, sentiment, and scrutiny alike.If the opposition wrests the seat, it would not necessarily mark a moral shift, for none of Mokama’s contenders are untouched by the state’s legacy of muscle and might, but it would signal a recalibration. It would suggest that alliances, caste equations, and public perception can still tilt the scales even against entrenched power.Either way, the fight in Mokama has outgrown the ballot box. It has become a test of endurance between two political orders, both born of Bihar’s rough-and-tumble past, both adapting to a voter base that now weighs loyalty as much as legacy.","The murder of 76-year-old Dularchand Yadav has ruptured a long-smouldering local equilibrium in Mokama. It has turned what should have been a routine assembly fight into a high-stakes prestige battle between two bahubali figures and the caste blocs that back them.

Hostage Drama At Powai Studio: Mumbai Police Rescues 17 Kidnapped Children, Accused Killed

MUMBAI: A 45-year-old social entrepreneur who ran a project for the state govt held 17 children, aged 12-15, a 75-year-old woman and his staffer hostage for three hours at a recording studio in Powai Thursday afternoon after calling them for auditions for a web series.The crisis ended after a police commando team stormed the studio following failed negotiations. Police said they shot him in the chest in self-defence after he fired from an air gun. He was declared dead in hospital.Police said Aarrya owned a company, Apsara Media, that directed awareness videos on social causes and had extensively worked with children.They said he had been holding auditions at RA Studio in Powai for the past five days for a web series he was planning. Thursday was the final casting call.Auditions began at 10am and the children—hailing from Navi Mumbai, Kolhapur, Satara, Sangli and other parts of the state—arrived earlier, said a security guard at Mahavir Classik, which housed the studio.The hostage drama played out after the captor, Rohit Aarrya, who had been living in a relative’s Chembur flat for the past few days, released a video saying he wanted “simple answers” to some questions and threatened to set the place ablaze if there was any move made to challenge him.In the clip, which was circulated to many media outlets, he said he was not a terrorist and only wanted “to be heard”. “Instead of dying by suicide, I have held some children hostage,” he said.The captor, Rohit Aarrya , was a social entrepreneur and project management consultant who owned a company, Apsara Media, that directed awareness videos on social causes.His social media profile showed he was an alumnus of Symbiosis International University, Pune, and had completed an executive MBA from ISB, Mumbai.He had worked extensively with children on the central govt’s Swacchh Bharat initiative, saying he was inspired by PM Narendra Modi’s plan for cleanliness in public spaces.Since 2017, Aarrya had engaged actors, including Prem Chopra, to enact short videos to generate awareness. He claimed actor Ramesh Deo as his mentor. His social media profiles contain pictures of ministers and a few celebrities.He said he had taken the children hostage “according to a plan”. “I really want to conduct the ‘Let’s Change’ programme. I am going to do it. If I am alive, then I will do it. If I die, then someone else will do it. But it will definitely happen,” he said.His tone then turned menacing. “It will happen with these kids only if they are not harmed. Because the slightest wrong move from your end will trigger me to set this place on fire and die in it.Whether I die or not, the kids will definitely be unnecessarily hurt and traumatised. I don’t know what will happen to them. If something does happen to them, I should not be held responsible.""Those persons should be held responsible who are triggering this unnecessarily, when a normal, common person just wants to talk. After my discussions are over, I will come out myself. I am not alone. I have more people with me. Many people have similar problems as mine. And I am going to give this solution only by talking. Please do not trigger me to do some harm to anybody.”Police spent nearly two hours trying to negotiate with the captor, Rohit Aarrya, and gauge his demands, but he refused to cooperate, even after one of the girls’ parents said she suffered from seizures, cops said. An official said he appeared calm when police spoke to him.City police chief Deven Bharti maintained that Aarrya fired first, prompting retaliatory police firing.“Regardless of his demands, we couldn’t let him play with lives. Our team fired back in self-defence. There was no other option.”Other officials reiterated that the safety of those held captive was the priority, adding that the team’s response was measured and as per the protocol. The death prompted calls by legal experts for a magisterial inquiry.","Rohit Aarrya, 45, held 17 children, aged 12-15, a 75-year-old woman and his staffer hostage for three hours at a recording studio in Powai.

How Michael Irvin discovered his wife’s early-onset Alzheimer’s

“We recognized some things were going wrong with her about ten years ago… We thought it was menopause… We buried my mom. She had Alzheimer’s. My mother-in-law was living with us because she had Alzheimer’s. And now we thought my wife was going through menopause at 49 because she’s coming at 50.”

Michael Irvin On Wife Having Alzheimer's In Her 50s | CLUB SHAY SHAY

“It’s quite hard to take care of someone 24 hours a day… I have to keep a 24-hour nurse with her all the time.”

“If anyone has earned the right to stay in her house, MY WIFE HAS!!! … That I shall honour. No matter what it takes.”

Being a football legend is one thing, but facing life’s toughest plays off the field is a whole different ballgame. Michael Irvin , the iconic Dallas Cowboys wide receiver, has opened up about one of the most personal challenges of his life, his wife Sandy Harrell (née Irvin) has been diagnosed with very early-onset Alzheimer’s disease.Irvin, known for his unforgettable catches and fiery personality on the field, revealed that his wife’s symptoms first appeared around 8–10 years ago. At the time, they thought it might be normal aging or menopause but it soon became clear that something more serious was happening and it needed attention. His emotional revelation gives fans a glimpse of the human side of a public figure often celebrated for his athletic prowess.Talking candidly, Irvin shared:This initial uncertainty highlights how subtle the early signs of Alzheimer’s can be especially in someone so young.Very early-onset Alzheimer’s (diagnosed under 65) is rare, and Irvin’s story shows the complex emotions families face when symptoms first appear.Irvin didn’t shy away from describing the realities of caring for his wife:Balancing the responsibilities of caregiving with his public life has been a profound challenge. Yet, Irvin’s dedication never wavered.

The fiery five-emoji comment from Kara Bieber under Sofia Castaneda’s World Series post had Blue Jays fans buzzing online

From the field to the feeds, the Blue Jays wives are winning hearts their own way

Toronto Blue Jays catcher Alejandro Kirk has been one of the key performers in the team’s World Series campaign against the Los Angeles Dodgers, driving in crucial runs and proving his consistency when it matters most. After helping the Blue Jays win the AL East title for the first time since 2015, Kirk’s bat has stayed hot into the postseason, where he has already hit two home runs and driven in six RBIs in five games. As much as the spotlight has stayed on his performance, it was his wife, Sofia Castaneda, who found herself trending recently after she shared a few glimpses from her time at Game 5 — a post that unexpectedly set social media abuzz across Blue Jays circles.Sofia, who has been a constant presence at the Rogers Centre and on the road, posted a carousel of images on Instagram showing her cheering for her husband from the stands during Wednesday night’s Game 5. The post, captioned “Recent > 🤍”, quickly drew reactions from fans and fellow players’ families alike. But it was Shane Bieber’s wife, Kara Bieber, whose fiery comment — “🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️” — turned the post into a viral moment overnight.Without a single word, Kara’s five-emoji reaction summed up both her excitement for Kirk’s performance and her admiration for Sofia’s unwavering support, sparking a flood of comments and likes from fans across the Blue Jays community.Within hours, the post became one of the most talked-about moments from the Blue Jays’ social media circle this postseason. Fans flooded the comment section, praising the show of friendship between the two players’ wives and calling it “the most wholesome Blue Jays moment of the year.” The exchange highlighted the close-knit camaraderie among players’ families — a side of professional sports rarely seen in such a lighthearted, genuine way.As the Blue Jays continue their chase for a long-awaited World Series crown, Kirk’s red-hot form has been mirrored by the rising visibility of the team’s wives and partners, who’ve brought a sense of unity and charm to the postseason narrative. Kara’s reaction may have lasted just five emojis, but it carried the same energy and warmth that Blue Jays fans have been rallying behind. And for a team chasing its first championship in nearly 30 years, that blend of on-field brilliance and off-field bonding might just be what defines their season. In a season full of big hits and bigger moments, it's these small gestures that keep fans smiling. And as the World Series drama unfolds, Blue Jays fans are loving every bit of it.

The Edmonton Oilers’ 4-3 overtime loss to the New York Rangers didn’t sit well with Leon Draisaitl , who questioned a key officiating decision that shifted the momentum late in the game. The controversy erupted when Rangers forward Mika Zibanejad high-sticked Jack Roslovic, leaving him bleeding on the ice. Despite clear contact, officials awarded only a two-minute minor penalty, sparking debate over the call.With the game tied 3-3, the Oilers went on a short power play that carried into overtime, but they couldn’t convert. Moments later, the Rangers scored the game-winner, handing Edmonton another frustrating defeat. What should have been a four-minute double minor became one of the night’s biggest talking points and Draisaitl didn’t hold back when asked about it afterward. For Leon Draisaitl and the Oilers, the defeat highlights growing frustration with crucial calls affecting key NHL matchups.“No, not sure. It doesn’t make a lot of sense, but yeah, it is what it is,” Draisaitl said postgame, clearly unhappy with the officials’ explanation. His remarks echoed the feeling among Oilers fans, who believed the team was shortchanged in a pivotal moment. The decision not only cost Edmonton valuable time on the man advantage but also stalled their late-game momentum.Still, Draisaitl didn’t blame the referees entirely. He pointed out that turnovers and poor puck management were major factors in the loss. “Just not clean enough with the puck. Turnovers just kind of turned the game a little bit. So yeah, just have to clean that up,” he admitted.The Oilers have now dropped three of their last five games, slipping to fourth in the Pacific Division with a 5-4-3 record. Despite standout performances from Draisaitl and Connor McDavid, Edmonton’s inconsistency and missed chances continue to hurt them. With McDavid and Draisaitl carrying the offensive load, Edmonton’s playoff hopes hinge on tightening their defensive structure and improving special teams efficiency. As they prepare for upcoming Western Conference matchups, the Oilers will need more discipline, sharper execution, and better focus to turn close games into wins.The Oilers’ upcoming schedule offers little room for error, with back-to-back tests against tough Western Conference rivals. These matchups will serve as a true measure of Edmonton’s resilience after a string of frustrating results.A stronger defensive effort and improved puck management will be vital if the Oilers hope to reassert themselves as playoff contenders. With Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl leading the charge, Edmonton’s ability to generate consistent offense and limit costly turnovers could define their playoff push. With the season still young, Draisaitl and McDavid’s leadership will be key in steering the team back on track before early setbacks start to shape their campaign.Also Read: Ryan Kesler sexual misconduct case: Meet the wife standing strong by ex-NHL star amid the scandal","Edmonton Oilers lost 4-3 to the New York Rangers in overtime.

John Schneider fumes as Shohei Ohtani's extended warm-up after batting breaks World Series rhythm

Ohtani makes history as first pitcher in 50 years to record a Game 7 hit



Fairness debate resurfaces as Ohtani’s two-way brilliance stretches baseball’s boundaries

When the lights burned brightest in Game 7 of the World Series on Saturday, tensions quietly flickered beneath the surface. Toronto Blue Jays manager John Schneider was seen speaking at length with home plate umpire Jordan Baker right after the first inning, in a moment that fans instantly picked up on. His expression said it all — calm but clearly bothered — as cameras zoomed in during the short break before the second inning began.The reason behind the exchange wasn’t immediately clear to spectators, but it soon became evident that it centered around Shohei Ohtani — the Los Angeles Dodgers’ two-way sensation who was both hitting and pitching in the championship decider. Ohtani had taken extra time to warm up before taking the mound, a move that some felt disrupted the rhythm of the inning and gave him an added edge. FOX broadcaster John Smoltz observed that Ohtani’s warm-up lasted nearly three minutes, far exceeding the usual 90-second window allotted to starting pitchers.That timing discrepancy was enough to frustrate Schneider, who appeared to believe the umpires were allowing Ohtani too much leeway. Though the conversation between the Blue Jays manager and Baker never grew heated, it reflected the razor-thin margins that define a Game 7.Every extra second, every small allowance, feels amplified when the championship is on the line. Ohtani’s rare two-way presence has often bent baseball’s norms, but this particular instance — in the heart of the World Series — sparked fresh debate over fairness and consistency.Even amid the subtle controversy, Ohtani added another historic line to his résumé. The Japanese star became the first pitcher since 1975 to both start a Game 7 and record a hit, breaking a 50-year drought in spectacular fashion. His single in the top of the first didn’t drive in runs, but it showcased the balance of power and precision that defines his game. The Blue Jays, however, survived the early scare and headed into the bottom half of the inning with momentum intact.When Ohtani finally took the mound, he backed up the hype with dominance. He struck out two of Toronto’s most dangerous hitters, including Vladimir Guerrero Jr., before catcher Will Smith threw out George Springer attempting to steal second base. Springer’s bewildered look as he walked back to the dugout captured the frustration — Ohtani was dictating the pace of the night.While the first-inning tension subsided quickly, it reignited an old question in baseball: how should the rules adapt to a player who breaks every mold? Ohtani’s ability to hit and pitch in the same game, especially on a stage as colossal as Game 7, challenges the sport’s traditional rhythms.As the Dodgers chased history and the Blue Jays fought to hold ground, that brief pause between innings became a symbol of Ohtani’s wider impact. He’s not only changing how games are played — he’s forcing baseball itself to evolve around him. And in the process, even a small warm-up delay was enough to light up a night that already had the world watching.For millions of fans across the globe, it was a reminder that when Shohei Ohtani steps on the field, baseball stops being routine - it becomes a moment in history, unforgettable.Also read: Shane Bieber’s wife Kara’s fiery reaction to Alejandro Kirk’s wife Sofia Castaneda’s World Series post sparks buzz among Blue Jays fans","Shohei Ohtani became the first pitcher since 1975 to both start a Game 7 and record a hit, breaking a 50-year drought in spectacular fashion.

Each swing felt like a statement, each hit a piece of history in motion. As he slid safely into base after his 30th postseason hit, his teammates erupted, aware they were witnessing something baseball had never seen before.The moment Clement’s 30th hit dropped into play, social media lit up with disbelief and admiration. @14764Sairose posted, “Ernie Clement is killing it! First player with 30 postseason hits—amazing! Those celebratory slides and poses show his pure joy.Go Blue Jays!” @ChKamran92804 declared, “Postseason hitting royalty crowned.” @BabyDomRants shouted, “BEST PLAYER OF ALL TIME.”Another fan named @sfgiantsfan15 wrote, “Clement is a beast! The most clutch hunter in MLB postseason history! Let’s get it.” Meanwhile, @iamskrptd simply summed it up: “30 hits? That’s not human.” It was the kind of moment social media lives for — a perfect storm of record-breaking brilliance and fan-fueled awe.In Game 7 against the Dodgers, Clement’s line — 4 at-bats, 1 run, 3 hits, 1 stolen base — looked like another solid performance on paper. But that third hit shattered a ceiling that had stood untouched through generations of postseason greats. No Derek Jeter, no David Ortiz, no Albert Pujols ever reached 30 postseason hits. Clement just did. His approach was simple yet devastatingly effective — putting bat to ball with surgical precision and turning every at-bat into opportunity.Baseball fans will remember this postseason not just for the wins, but for the way Ernie Clement played the game — joyful, fearless, and human in the most unreal way. As one fan put it, “30 hits in one postseason is insane — man’s rewriting history in real time 🔥.” Whether or not Toronto lifts the championship trophy, Clement’s name is now forever linked with postseason greatness — a once-in-a-lifetime run that felt, in every sense of the word, “not human. ” He came to play, made history, and left the game better than he found it.Also read: Shane Bieber’s wife Kara’s fiery reaction to Alejandro Kirk’s wife Sofia Castaneda’s World Series post sparks buzz among Blue Jays fans",Ernie Clement became the first player ever to record 30 hits in a single postseason.

3× All-Star, 2× Silver Slugger, Gold Glove



$65 Million (existing deal)



Power bat, DH/OF option





Theare entering a crucial offseason, and all eyes are on the uncertain future of their franchise slugger, Pete Alonso. With Alonso potentially heading toward free agency or a trade, the Mets could be forced to find a new power bat to anchor their lineup. One intriguing - and surprising - name emerging as a potential target is Atlanta Braves veteranOzuna, a three-time All-Star, two-time Silver Slugger, and Gold Glove winner, has been a central figure in the Braves’ offensive success in recent seasons. Now, as Atlanta reportedly looks to shift its approach to the designated hitter position, Ozuna’s future with the team appears uncertain - and the Mets could take advantage of that situation.With Alonso’s future hanging in the balance, New York Mets’ front office is expected to explore every avenue to maintain offensive firepower. Ozuna could offer a proven, right-handed power bat capable of driving in runs and keeping pressure on opposing pitchers. The 34-year-old slugger remains a formidable threat at the plate, known for his ability to produce consistent power numbers and handle high-leverage situations.Last season, the Braves reportedly attempted to trade Marcell Ozuna at the deadline, but multiple deals fell through. The veteran, who holds 10-5 rights (10 years in MLB, 5 with the same team), was said to have vetoed three separate trade proposals. Despite that, the expectation heading into 2026 is that Atlanta could revisit potential moves involving him as they adjust their roster strategy.Reports suggest that Braves general manager Alex Anthopoulos and his staff are leaning toward a more flexible approach for the designated hitter role. Instead of relying on a full-time DH, the team plans to rotate players like Ronald Acuña Jr., Jurickson Profar, Sean Murphy, and Matt Olson through the position to keep them fresh. This marks a strategic shift that could make Ozuna expendable as Atlanta focuses on lineup versatility for the 2026 campaign.If Alonso departs, the New York Mets will need an established veteran presence to fill the void in the middle of their order. Marcell Ozuna’s proven track record and familiarity with NL East pitching make him an ideal candidate. A short-term deal - likely one or two years - would give New York both stability and flexibility while allowing Ozuna to continue showcasing his value.Also read: MLB trade rumors: Detroit Tigers could sign $130 million Philadelphia Phillies All-Star as he prepares to enter free agency Seeing Marcell Ozuna in Mets colors would certainly shock fans, given his long-standing rivalry with New York as a Brave. However, the move could be exactly what the New York Mets need to stay competitive in the NL East. If Alonso’s time in Queens is nearing its end, Ozuna could serve as both a short-term spark and a bridge to the next era of Mets baseball - ensuring the team’s power production doesn’t skip a beat heading into 2026.","Marcell Ozuna is a three-time All-Star, two-time Silver Slugger, and Gold Glove winner.

Tyler Glasnow’s composure under fire shows why the Los Angeles Dodgers trust him in their biggest moments

Glasnow’s off-field love story shows the same charm and confidence that defines his game

The Dodgers ace proves true perfection lies in balance both on and off the field

When the pressure was at its highest, Tyler Glasnow showed what it truly means to stay composed under fire. Under the roaring lights of Rogers Centre, with runners on second and third and no outs, the Los Angeles Dodgers ace faced a do-or-die situation that could have ended their World Series hopes. But Glasnow, calm as ever, turned tension into triumph, needing just three pitches to retire three Toronto Blue Jays batters and seal the Dodgers’ Game 6 victory — a performance that pushed the series to a dramatic Game 7.It wasn’t just the stat line that defined the moment — it was the sheer poise and control that made it unforgettable. His fastball was pinpoint, his rhythm unbroken, and his demeanor unshaken. For a pitcher who’s built a reputation for thriving when it matters most, this outing was a statement. With 1.0 inning pitched, no hits, no walks, one strikeout, and an ERA of 3.18, Glasnow didn’t just pitch — he rescued Los Angeles when it mattered most, proving that pressure only sharpens his edge.This Game 6 escape wasn’t luck — it was the product of Glasnow’s complete command. Even when the noise rose to deafening levels, he stayed locked in, executing each pitch with surgical precision. The Dodgers’ bench seemed to breathe easier the moment he stepped onto the mound.Every championship team needs a player who thrives on tension, and for the Dodgers, that heartbeat is Glasnow. His ability to keep control when chaos surrounds him has turned potential disasters into defining moments. As Los Angeles heads into Game 7, it’s that same icy composure that will anchor their push for the title.Away from the mound, Glasnow’s story carries its own Hollywood magic. The Dodgers ace is engaged to Meghan Murphy, a physician assistant he met in one of baseball’s most memorable modern love stories. While rehabbing from an injury in 2021, he spotted Murphy in the stands at a Tampa Bay Rays game. “She was sitting in the front few rows, and I was like, ‘She kind of looks cute,’” Glasnow recalled on On Base with Mookie Betts in May 2024. He wrote his number on a baseball and sent it to her — but the next day, she flipped the script. “She came back the next day, wrote her number on a ball, and came up behind the dugout and threw it at me. She was like, ‘You text me. I’m not going to text you.’”The couple got engaged in August 2024, with their wedding set for November 2025. Their story feels fitting for Los Angeles — a mix of timing, charm, and character that could have been written for the big screen.Whether he’s saving the Dodgers’ season with a three-pitch escape or planning a life with his soon-to-be wife, Tyler Glasnow is redefining what it means to be composed under pressure. His Game 6 heroics and grounded off-field presence make him not just the ace of the Dodgers’ rotation but also one of the most admired figures in baseball today. Calm, confident, and quietly magnetic — Glasnow has shown that real perfection isn’t about overpowering moments, but owning them. For Glasnow, both the game and life seem perfectly in rhythm. And right now, he's winning at both - with calm, class, and quiet confidence. The spotlight may chase him, but he continues to let his composure do the talking.Also read: Dave Roberts’ unexpected race with Hyeseong Kim at Dodgers’ camp spirals into a hilarious moment fans can’t stop talking about","Tyler Glasnow saved the Los Angeles Dodgers season with a three-pitch escape in Game 6 of the World Series.

Who is Alejandro Kirk? Meet the Toronto Blue Jays catcher who defies every doubt about his height as his fearless World Series performance outshines the scoreline,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/mlb/news/who-is-alejandro-kirk-meet-the-toronto-blue-jays-catcher-who-defies-every-doubt-about-his-height-as-his-fearless-world-series-performance-outshines-the-scoreline/articleshow/125029096.cms,"Alejandro Kirk (Image via: IG/X)

Alejandro Kirk’s short frame, big heart, and calm leadership make him Toronto Blue Jays ’ quiet powerhouse

From Tijuana to Toronto, Kirk carries Mexico’s pride on baseball’s grandest stage

The catcher who stood tall when it mattered most

Alejandro Kirk may not look like the prototype of a modern power-hitting catcher, but when the lights shine brightest, the 26-year-old from Mexico always finds a way to rise above expectations. In the World Series clash against the Los Angeles Dodgers, Kirk’s grit and game sense stood tall even as Toronto fell short. His fearless presence behind the plate, his clutch contact at key moments, and his poise under pressure showed exactly why the Blue Jays call him the anchor of their lineup.Standing at just 5-foot-8, Kirk has heard every doubt there is about his height, yet he’s turned it into fuel. From his breakout All-Star appearance to becoming a Silver Slugger winner in 2022, Kirk has built a reputation as one of baseball’s smartest and most composed hitters. His .282 average this regular season and calm command of the pitching staff underline a maturity beyond his years — the kind that can steady a team through chaos and carry them through October.Kirk’s size might spark online chatter, but his skill set silences it instantly. In Game 7 against the Dodgers, he went 2-for-5 — not a flashy line, but every hit came with weight. He’s not built for highlight-reel home runs; instead, he thrives on timing, control, and a mind that reads the game faster than most.That’s what makes him so vital to Toronto’s offense — a steady rhythm setter in a lineup stacked with power hitters.Teammates often describe Kirk as “the calm in the storm.” His ability to manage pitchers, make quick in-game adjustments, and stay unfazed in high-stress innings sets him apart. It’s the kind of leadership that doesn’t shout — it anchors.“Proud to represent my country, Mexico, and a bunch of Mexican players in the All-Star Game,” Kirk said earlier this summer. “We should all be proud of that.” For him, the World Series isn’t just about statistics; it’s a stage to represent a growing generation of Mexican baseball talent.His journey — from an unsigned teenager in Tijuana to one of MLB’s top catchers — is a reminder that talent can come from anywhere, and heart has no height requirement. Kirk’s story continues to inspire young players across Latin America, showing that perseverance, humility, and quiet confidence can break through any barrier.Toronto may not have lifted the trophy this time, but Kirk’s fearless World Series performance outshined the scoreline. His resilience and resolve have cemented him as more than just a stat line — he’s the soul of a team chasing its next championship. As the Blue Jays look ahead, one thing is clear: Alejandro Kirk has already proven that greatness isn’t measured in inches but in impact.Also read: Shane Bieber’s wife Kara’s fiery reaction to Alejandro Kirk’s wife Sofia Castaneda’s World Series post sparks buzz among Blue Jays fans",Alejandro Kirk is a 5-foot-8 catcher for the Toronto Blue Jays.

Will Josh Allen play against the Kansas City Chiefs tonight? Latest injury update on the Buffalo Bills QB,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/will-josh-allen-play-against-the-kansas-city-chiefs-tonight-latest-injury-update-on-the-buffalo-bills-qb/articleshow/125027667.cms,"Josh Allen is set to play tonight against the Kansas City Chiefs. This game is significant for AFC playoff seeding. Allen is expected to perform at his best, matching Patrick Mahomes drive for drive. Buffalo's defense faces challenges, placing more pressure on Allen to lead the team. His performance is critical for a Bills victory in this high-stakes matchup.

Will Josh Allen play tonight?

Buffalo needs their quarterback to stabilize the entire night not just a quarter or a half

Bills–Chiefs never arrive quietly. Every time Josh Allen and Patrick Mahomes share a field, it becomes less about standings or Vegas totals and more about another chapter in a rivalry that feels generational. The AFC hasn’t had many quarterback duels in the modern era that have the same magnetism Brady–Manning did, but this one truly might.Regular season bragging rights belong to Buffalo. Postseason scars belong to Kansas City. And tonight, the cameras once again tilt toward the Bills’ quarterback being the engine, not just the narrator, of Buffalo’s path forward. The emotional stakes rise even higher because this isn’t an “extra” regular season game. This feels like a seeding swing.Yes, Josh Allen will be playing against the Kansas City Chiefs tonight. NFL Spin Zone’s Lou Scataglia recently predicted Allen and Mahomes would “combine for 6 touchdown passes in another Chiefs-Bills classic.” The logic behind that projection is rooted in the exact offensive environments these two carry, Buffalo can still go vertical when the rhythm is right, and Kansas City continues to trust Mahomes to solve late-game geometry.Allen has been at his absolute sharpest outside of Week 1 versus Baltimore and these are historically the types of contests where he pushes into that extra gear. Buffalo doesn’t just need production, they need timely production, and they need Allen to match Mahomes drive-for-drive if this game goes high tempo.Kansas City just rolled through a strong month, and as Sayre Bedinger noted, “Patrick Mahomes has played exceptionally well over the majority of the last month.” Buffalo’s defense is developing pieces on the fly with new interior bodies in the rotation, which further pushes pressure back on Allen.And yes, he’s good to go. Buffalo needs his best version, because the Bills don’t get to win this type of night with a B-level performance.Also Read: “Hailee gotta sue”: Stephen A.

LeBron James’ sciatica setback leaves Los Angeles Lakers searching for rhythm early in the season

On Friday night, the Los Angeles Lakers took on Ja Morant and the Memphis Grizzlies to start the NBA Cup play. LeBron James , the Lakers' legend, is still out owing to a right-side sciatica issue.The 40-year-old attacker has been unable to make his season debut due to an ailment that affects the sciatic nerve that runs from the lower back down through the leg. He will possible be back by the mid-November. Hence, all eyes are now on the Lakers' ability to adjust without their most seasoned captain as they get ready to play the Miami Heat.Due to a current inflammation on the right side of his sciatic nerve, LeBron James will not play against the Miami Heat tonight. He has been sidelined since the preseason due to this problem, which radiates pain from the lower back through the leg and glute.On October 9, the Lakers first declared that LeBron will be sidelined for a minimum of three to four weeks due to nerve irritation in his gluteal region. James may return in mid-November, according to ESPN's Dave McMenamin.James is undoubtedly finding it difficult to be on the outside. As his retirement draws nearer, he doesn't want time to pass. However, in the interim, he has done a fantastic job of being a helpful teammate.LeBron's doctors are cautiously optimistic that he could return by the second or third week of November, but head coach JJ Redick said that sciatica is ""a tricky condition"" with no set recovery timeframe.He is missing the season opening for the first time in his legendary 23-year NBA career, which is a sign of the severity of the injury and the team's emphasis on long-term preservation.Due to the Lakers' heavy reliance on their supporting cast in the absence of its two biggest names, LeBron James and Luka Doncic, this setback has sparked more general concerns about the team's start to the season. However, fortunately, Doncic is back. Now, everyone's waiting for the Lakers' legend.Under new head coach JJ Redick, the Lakers still have a solid and deep roster, but the lack of consistency among the starters has caused problems with both offensive flow and defensive harmony. Due to LeBron's prolonged absence, the team's younger players are now receiving more attention.There is a leadership void on and off the court as a result of LeBron's absence. Players like Austin Reaves have responded by stepping up and assuming greater responsibility as the team's main scorers and playmakers. In addition to helping lead a younger team through the early part of the season, Reaves has been crucial in preserving offensive rhythm.Redick has made changes to the Lakers' offensive scheme, focusing on increased ball movement and spacing to make up for LeBron's absence as a playmaker. Although neither player can match LeBron's on-court influence, the team has looked to Jarred Vanderbilt and Rui Hachimura to help fill the loss on defense.It will be simple to evaluate the Lakers' 2025–26 ceiling if James is cleared to play and has a chance to settle in with the new look.Also read: LeBron James teases a thrilling new venture that blends nostalgia, imagination, and a hint of Halloween mystery",LeBron James is still out with a right-side sciatica issue.

How Jay Shah pushed for women's cricket, BCCI secretary Saikia explains

NAVI MUMBAI: The ending of the fairytale called India's maiden Women's World Cup triumph couldn't have been more fitting. Chasing a low full toss, South African big-hitter Nadine de Klerk, who had smashed a 54-ball 84 not out in the league phase to inflict a three-wicket defeat on India, chipped the ball to extra cover, where Indian captain Harmanpreet Kaur jogged backwards to take the catch. Having slammed a valuable half-century (58, 58b, 3x4, 1x6) earlier, Deepti Sharma took a five-for (5 for 39 in 9.3 overs), making the final her own with both bat and ball while fashioning India's biggest-ever victory in women’s cricket.Soon after, a 45,000-strong crowd, along with the Indian team, broke into celebrations, with Harman and the Women in Blue breaking into tears of joy.Finally, the Indian women’s cricket team’s ‘83 moment had arrived. Fighting back after suffering three defeats on the trot that had put their World Cup campaign in danger, India won the three matches that mattered to cross the line — at last, after numerous heartbreaks.Outclassing South Africa by 52 runs in the final of the 2025 Women’s ODI World Cup at the DY Patil Stadium on Sunday night, with 45,000 fans cheering them, India finally put an end to their long wait for an elusive World Cup crown. A billion hearts can now celebrate the Women in Blue’s memorable, historic, game-changing triumph for women’s cricket in India for a long time to come — courtesy of a player who wasn’t even in the reserves!“God has sent me here to do something good,” Shafali Verma had said before India slayed giants Australia in the semifinals, thanks to a brilliant hundred by Jemimah Rodrigues.Unfurling a blistering, career-best 87 (78b, 7x4, 2x6), which helped India post 298 for six after being asked to bat first, and later taking two for 36 in seven overs, Shafali Verma — marking a fairytale comeback — played a massive part in India posting 298 for six after a two-hour rain delay, and then striking vital blows when South Africa looked to be cruising in their chase at one stage.Following up on a match-winning epic knock of 169 in the semifinal against England at Guwahati, South African captain and opener Laura Wolvaardt slammed another superb century (101, 98b, 10x4, 1x6). But when she was caught — in the fielder's third attempt — by a sprinting Amanjot Kaur off Deepti in the 42nd over, the game was firmly in India's grip.The Proteas crumbled under the pressure of a tall chase and a home crowd that cheered their team to the historic win all the way. Chasing 299, South Africa seemed to be coasting at 114 for two in the 21st over, before Shafali’s twin strikes — she caught Sune Luus (25, 31b, 4x4) off her own innocuous-looking delivery, and had Marizanne Kapp (4) caught behind in her next over.Wolvaardt and fellow opener Tazmin Brits (23, 35b, 2x4, 1x6) had added 51 in 57 balls before Amanjot Kaur produced a direct hit to give India the first breakthrough. Soon, Anneke Bosch, who had a poor game as she dropped a sitter at deep mid-wicket off Shafali when the batter was on 57, was trapped on the back foot by Shree Charani for a six-ball duck.Banking too heavily on their in-form captain, South Africa were brought back into the game by Annerie Dercksen (25 off 37 balls), but Deepti yorked her in the 40th over to put India in the driver's seat.Earlier, Shafali Verma's blistering, career-best 87 (78b, 7x4, 2x6) and Deepti Sharma's composed half-century (58, 58b, 3x4, 1x6), along with fine support acts by Smriti Mandhana (45, 58b, 8x4) and Richa Ghosh (34 off 24 balls, 3x4, 2x6), helped India post a challenging, yet slightly under-par total of 298 for six against South Africa in the 2025 Women's ODI World Cup final at the DY Patil Stadium on Sunday.Asked to bat after a two-hour delayed start due to unseasonal rain, India were off to a flying start as Shafali, recalled for the knockouts after Pratika Rawal's injury, and vice-captain Smriti Mandhana (45), cheered by a vociferous home crowd of 45,000, added 104 for the opening wicket in 106 balls to lay the platform for a big total. It was just the second hundred-run opening stand in WODI World Cup finals.Playing delightful strokes, the duo brought up India’s fifty in just 39 balls, as the tournament hosts raced away to 64 for no loss in 10 overs. Looking to take on the bowlers by charging down repeatedly, Shafali tonked two sixes down the ground — the second one off de Klerk being a treat to watch.Scoring her first WODI fifty in over three years — the last one came against South Africa too, in July 2022 — Shafali, who scored her fifth half-century off 49 balls, took the bull by the horns, taking the attack to the Proteas before falling short of her maiden century when she perished while trying to clear mid-off off the spirited Ayabonga Khaka, who was the pick of the bowlers, taking three for 58 in nine overs and striking at regular intervals to keep South Africa in the game.Shafali's 87 is now the highest-ever individual score by an Indian opening batter in a World Cup final — men or women, ODI or T20I. At 21 years and 278 days, she's also the youngest player to score a fifty in a Women's ODI World Cup final.The Proteas heaved a sigh of relief when Mandhana was caught behind while trying to cut Chloe Tryon, but Shafali, who hit the very first ball she faced in the final — from Khaka — for a four past point, kept going, adding 62 in 62 balls for the second wicket with semifinal centurion Jemimah Rodrigues (24 off 37 balls, one four).Striving for their maiden World Cup triumph like India, South Africa were also boosted by an economical spell by left-arm spinner Nonkululeko Mlaba, who took one for 47 in 10 overs on a batting beauty, putting the brakes on India's innings.Fighting back after India's commanding start, South Africa did well to deny the tournament hosts a psychological 300-mark. Still, India recorded the second-highest total ever in a Women's ODI World Cup final, behind Australia's 356 for five against England in the 2022 World Cup.Striking in successive overs, Khaka removed Shafali and Jemimah (caught at extra cover), while Mlaba castled skipper Harmanpreet Kaur (20 off 29 balls), ending her promising 56-ball, 52-run partnership with Deepti Sharma for the fourth wicket.India were cruising at 223 for three in the 39th over when Harman was dismissed while trying to play a late cut. That blow saw them get just 75 in the remaining overs, mostly thanks to Richa's lusty blows and her 35-ball, 47-run partnership for the sixth wicket with Deepti that brought the crowd alive. Richa had hammered a power-packed, fighting 94 off 77 balls when these two teams met in the group stage, and gave impetus to India's innings on Sunday, smashing sixes off de Klerk and Kapp — a super shot over extra cover off a wide yorker.Anchoring the innings, Deepti stroked her 18th ODI half-century and third in this tournament before she was run out off the last ball.While their ground fielding was brilliant, South Africa dropped a couple of catches. They first let off Shafali when, batting on 53 in the 21st over, she slog-swept Sune Luus to deep mid-wicket, where Anneke Bosch fluffed the chance, and in the 40th over, skipper Laura Wolvaardt grassed Deepti’s catch at long-on. In between, Marizanne Kapp dropped a slightly tougher chance off Deepti off her own bowling.","India beat South Africa by 52 runs in the final of the 2025 Women’s ODI World Cup at the DY Patil Stadium on Sunday night. Deepti Sharma took a five-for (5 for 39 in 9.3 overs), making the final her own with both bat and ball. Shafali Verma played a massive part in India posting 298 for six after a two-hour rain delay.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125041517,imgsize-128366,width-400,resizemode-4/india-trophy-0311-pti.jpg"

India's women's cricket team captain Harmanpreet Kaur revealed how intense criticism after their loss against England brought the team closer together, leading to their first World Cup victory. Speaking at a post-match press conference in Navi Mumbai on Sunday, she emphasized how the team's unity strengthened following their challenging period of consecutive losses.The Indian team faced a difficult phase when they lost three consecutive matches against South Africa, Australia, and England. The England match was particularly devastating as India failed to chase down a target of 289 despite being well-positioned at 234 for 3.Following the England defeat, head coach Amol Mujumdar confronted the team while external critics called for leadership changes.""Not a single player said 'what will happen now' when things were not going well, especially after the heartbreaking loss against England. That night changed a lot of things for us, we thought we will have to come out with a stronger mindset and everyone came together even more,"" Harmanpreet explained.When questioned about handling harsh criticism, Harmanpreet maintained a balanced perspective. ""It is a part of our life, criticism, because it brings some balance. I don't blame those who criticise us and I don't have much to say. For me it is important to keep things balanced within the team.""The team adopted their coach's approach of creating an internal bubble and ignoring external pressures.Harmanpreet and vice-captain Smriti Mandhana were determined to avoid another disappointment after experiencing several heartbreaks in previous World Cups.""I have played a lot of World Cups with her (Mandhana).

As captain Harmanpreet Kaur walked up to receive the ICC Women’s World Cup trophy from ICC chair Jay Shah at Mumbai’s DY Patil Stadium, what happened next — and what didn’t — stole the show.After a warm handshake, Harmanpreet, true to Indian tradition, instinctively began to bow down to touch Shah’s feet — a gesture of reverence and gratitude. But Shah immediately stopped her with a gentle nod, signaling “no.” The exchange lasted barely a second, but it became the emotional highlight of the night, winning hearts across the nation. Fans flooded social media with praise, calling it a moment that perfectly embodied Indian values — respect meeting humility in the grandest sporting arena.Moments later, the atmosphere transformed from emotional to electric.

Why Josh Allen’s praise felt different and not like a typical PR cleanup quote

Why their love story is now becoming its own counter-narrative



More coverage on NFL:

Sometimes the clearest message a celebrity can send isn’t crafted through a press release, it’s spoken casually, confidently, in an interview where body language tells the truth. That’s exactly what Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen did when he addressed the long-running social media speculation questioning the pace and stability of his marriage to Hailee Steinfeld Sitting across from Marty Smith on ESPN, Allen didn’t dance around it. He acknowledged who holds the most weight in his personal universe and it wasn’t the MVP trophy, the lucrative extension, or the constant football noise. His voice steadied, and his message landed precisely where he wanted it: “My wife is the most fulfilling part of my life.”Josh Allen didn’t just call Steinfeld supportive, he elevated her into the emotional center of his identity. “My wife is an unbelievable, undeniable rockstar,” he said, making it clear that her sacrifice and her presence legitimately reshape how he approaches life beyond the huddle.And his comments weren’t framed like damage control after online chatter instead, they were framed as gratitude. He was describing a life shift that is still happening in real time.He emphasized again: “My wedding day was the most important day of my life. All that other stuff the MVP, the extension, was kinda just the cherry on top.” No quarterback says that unless they mean it.Fans questioned the speed, from dating in 2023 to vows in 2025, but their choices tell a different truth. Steinfeld paused acting during his season. Allen shed the “football is everything” identity he grew up with. And both speak in future tense, not Hollywood expiration-date language.It isn’t perfect Instagram gloss, it’s two careers weaving one rhythm. The real takeaway? Allen didn’t silence the doubters, he outgrew them.","Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen has publicly declared his wife, Hailee Steinfeld, as the most fulfilling aspect of his life, surpassing career achievements.

Travis Kelce injury scare raises brief concern for Chiefs



Travis Kelce’s response proves why he’s a fan favorite



More coverage on NFL:

Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce had a tough first half in Sunday’s high-stakes clash against the Buffalo Bills, but he didn’t stay down for long. The star tight end took a heavy shot to the chest from Bills safety Cole Bishop on a pass attempt from Patrick Mahomes late in the second quarter. The hit left Kelce visibly shaken as he walked toward the locker room just before halftime, while the Chiefs trailed 21-13.As he made his way off the field, Bills fans hurled taunts from the stands, trying to get under his skin. Instead of backing down, Kelce turned their jeers into motivation. He cupped his hand to his ear, flashed a confident nod, and mouthed the words, “I love it, I love it,” in response — a move that instantly went viral among NFL fans. The moment perfectly captured Kelce’s fiery spirit and unshakable confidence, even under pressure.The incident occurred after Mahomes targeted Kelce in the end zone on what could have been a crucial scoring play. The throw sailed slightly behind, allowing Bishop to deliver a clean but hard hit to Kelce’s ribs. The impact appeared to knock the wind out of him. Though he left for the locker room early, reports later confirmed that Kelce cleared concussion protocol at halftime and returned to start the third quarter.On the first play of the second half, he caught a pass, signaling that he was back and ready to battle.Kelce had been relatively quiet before the hit, recording only one catch for 20 yards in the first half. His early struggles were a stark contrast to his dominant outing the previous week against Washington, where he posted six receptions for 99 yards and a touchdown. Yet, his resilience against Buffalo once again reminded fans why he remains one of the toughest and most passionate players in the league.Despite taking a painful shot and being taunted by opposing fans, Kelce’s response showed class and grit. His “I love it” gesture wasn’t just defiance — it was a declaration of competitive pride. Whether it’s catching crucial passes from Mahomes or standing tall against rival fanbases, Travis Kelce continues to embody the spirit of a true NFL warrior.In the end, the brief injury scare only strengthened his legend — a reminder that even when knocked down, the Chiefs’ star always gets back up stronger.","Travis Kelce took a hard hit to the chest from Bills safety Cole Bishop in the second quarter.

However, his quick return to the sideline, helmet in hand, signaled confidence from trainers. This display of toughness reinforces Nacua's crucial role in the Rams' offense and his reputation for grit, providing a significant emotional lift.

Puca Nacua’s physical grit continues to build his reputation in Los Angeles

Even the brief absence highlights exactly how valuable he is to Sean McVay

More coverage on NFL:

The Los Angeles Rams experienced a tense moment on Sunday when star wide receiver Puka Nacua left the field following a shoulder issue in the matchup against the New Orleans Saints. The moment felt serious because of how integral Nacua has been to the Rams’ offense and how quickly momentum can shift when a top target goes down. But moments of panic quickly flipped into cautious relief. Cameras spotted Nacua not only walking on the sideline, but standing with his helmet in hand, indicating that trainers felt confident enough to allow him to return. For a fanbase already dealing with injuries this season, even that visual was a major emotional lift.Before exiting, Nacua had already stacked a strong statline: seven receptions, 95 yards, and a touchdown, the exact type of efficient, volume-heavy productivity the Rams are building around. The timing of the exit mattered too. The game had rhythm, the Saints’ defense was playing aggressively, and Nacua was a constant after-catch threat. So when he headed to the tent, anxious shock was fair.That’s what made his reappearance meaningful, not just because of availability, but because it fed into a broader narrative about toughness.This is a player who doesn’t check out at the first sign of discomfort. He has become that intangible guy, the one who embraces contact, battles leverage, and refuses to lose competitive posture.The Rams have leaned on Nacua this year not as a “co-star,” but as a driver of their passing identity. His quick return reinforced that McVay’s system, timing, leverage, layered depth, hits a different gear when Nacua is on the field. And it further signaled that this injury, at least for now, doesn’t appear to represent a long-term cloud.There will still be follow-ups. There always are. But Sunday’s visual, Puka with his helmet, ready to re-enter, was the strongest possible answer to the question Rams fans feared most.","Los Angeles Rams wide receiver Puka Nacua left Sunday's game with a shoulder issue.

The MedMen LAX lawsuit adds a legal weapon to an ongoing perception war



Cardi B pregnancy with Stefon Diggs puts Offset’s name in yet another tabloid cycle

Offset is walking into a perfect storm and this time, it isn’t a music rollout, a messy tweet, or a rapper-vs-rapper rivalry fueling the headlines. The former Migos rapper is now being dragged into a civil courtroom after a Los Angeles security guard accused him of assault, battery and emotional distress during an incident at a MedMen dispensary earlier this year. Lawsuits are one thing but this situation isn’t happening in a vacuum.This legal fight arrives at the very same moment Offset’s personal life is under the microscope again, as his divorce from Cardi B plays out publicly, while she prepares to welcome a baby with Patriots WR Stefon Diggs. It's a scandal, timeline collisions and reputation damage all at once.The guard, Jim Sanchez, alleges he was physically attacked after simply asking Offset for identification, a basic dispensary requirement. His lawsuit describes “significant physical and emotional injuries,” a hospital visit, headaches, and neck trauma. Offset’s side counters with an entirely different story, claiming Sanchez escalated, “spat” at him and charged toward the rapper, which they say triggered Offset to punch back in self-defense.Two versions of the same moment. One real verdict is still pending. But the stakes are bigger than just damages, this is happening in the exact era where Offset’s public image cannot survive another hit.Cardi B’s personal arc, from “in a good space” to preparing to have a child with Stefon Diggs in February 2025, has made every Offset headline feel heavier, louder, and more symbolic.Her past accusation that he harassed her, tried to manipulate bloggers, and even contacted his new girlfriend has already shaped how people react to any new allegation involving his name. This case now reads like a character test to fans, not just a police-style incident report.Offset isn’t just fighting a lawsuit. He’s fighting a narrative and that may be tougher to beat than Sanchez.Also Read: “Hailee gotta sue”: Stephen A.

The NBA recently penalized Joel Embiid of the Philadelphia 76ers with a $50,000 fine for his ""lewd gesture"" during the game between the Sixers and the Boston Celtics that ended in a score of 109-108 against the latter. In the first half of the game, Embiid turned one of the Celtics' foul shots into three by making the famous and very well-known Degeneration X chop celebration seen for years.He was then fined heavily by the NBA in retaliation, although he has already lost money from the same celebration in the past. When he makes a significant move on the floor, he is highly expressive. Every time he makes a significant play on the court, he always celebrates in some way, especially using the DX ""s*ck it"" chop.On Sunday, the NBA announced that Joel Embiid would be punished by a fine of $50,000 for the reportedly obscene gesture he made during the game against Boston on Friday night. The punishment was confirmed by James Jones, the league's executive vice president.At the 7:08 mark of the first quarter against the Celtics, Embiid made a basket and was fouled followed by a chopping movement to his groin. He has already been fined for the signal four times at minimum: initially $75,000 in December 2024, later $35,000 in October 2023, and lastly $25,000 in January 2023.It doesn't appear that Embiid will reportedly stop using the gesture anytime soon, even if the NBA may continue to fine him for it. The main post announcing the fine, read:“NEW YORK, Nov. 2, 2025 - Philadelphia 76ers center Joel Embiid has been fined $50,000 for making a lewd gesture on the playing court, it was announced today by James Jones, Executive Vice President, Head of Basketball Operations. The incident occurred with 7:08 remaining in the first quarter of the 76ers' 109-108 loss to the Boston Celtics on Oct. 31 at Xfinity Mobile Arena…”After that, Embiid used X to criticize the NBA for his fine. He noted that when officials make blocking calls on the floor, they use a similar motion.“Yall better start fining the refs for doing the “Lewd”, “blocking foul” gesture since I’m not allowed to do it #NFL..”Embiid then ended his message to the league with another tweet. To support his argument, he shared a GIF of an official making the same gesture.Triple H, a member of D-Generation X, helped introduce Embiid and the Sixers in the postseason in previous years since Embiid has made the c**tch chop a fairly frequent part of his celebrating arsenal.Even with the league fining him twice in 2023 for using the same celebration, Embiid isn't seemingly retiring the move. Considering he loves playing the heel, it's not a surprise that he would use a wrestling celebration as his go-to action after a big play.Embiid talked about how much he loved wrestling as a kid, especially Triple H and all of DX. He said in 2023:""There's no secret that Triple H is my guy.. Obviously, DX, when I used to watch wrestling, those were my guys. Any time I get the chance, I haven't done it in a while so I just felt like it was a good and-1. I got the ball, I didn't even see the rim, and I felt like it was deserving of a good celebration.""Meanwhile, with Embiid out, the Sixers will play the Brooklyn Nets on Sunday to start a three-game road trip. He will probably make a comeback on Tuesday when the Sixers play the Chicago Bulls.Also read: Why is Joel Embiid sidelined tonight against the Magic?

“Sherwood is better than McDavid”: Connor McDavid ripped by fans after Kiefer Sherwood’s hat trick — calling his slow start embarrassing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/sherwood-is-better-than-mcdavid-connor-mcdavid-ripped-by-fans-after-kiefer-sherwoods-hat-trick-calling-his-slow-start-embarrassing/articleshow/125033708.cms,"A recent hat trick by Kiefer Sherwood sparked online debate, with some fans questioning why he had more goals than Connor McDavid early in the season. Despite McDavid's higher point total and elite assists, the focus temporarily shifted to pure goal counts. However, supporters reminded critics of McDavid's usual scoring surge later in the season.

Fans use Kiefer Sherwood’s breakout to stir debate — and some posts were intentionally provocative

Connor McDavid defenders push back — and remind everyone what April usually looks like

We’ve seen Connor McDavid get criticized before, but it’s rare that an early-season scoring lull leads to such exaggerated comparisons. After Kiefer Sherwood’s recent hat trick against the St. Louis Blues, a small portion of X surfaced a surprising take: why does Sherwood have more goals?McDavid is sitting at three goals in his first 12 games, while Sherwood has opened the year with nine. That stat alone was more than enough for some fans to start stirring the pot. Even though McDavid is still producing and still driving Edmonton’s offense, the conversation temporarily shifted away from context and toward pure goal count shock value.Sherwood’s hat trick captured attention across Canada, with reporter Rick Dhaliwal noting, “When your hot your hot, Sherwood with the hat trick goal. Tied for the NHL lead in goals with 9.” That naturally fed into comparison fuel.Comments ranged from playful trolling to straight-up hot takes, including: “Kiefer Sherwood is better than Connor McDavid Lets wake this up.” Another fan piled on with, “Kiefer Sherwood has more goals last night than McDavid has all season.”But buried beneath that noise is the obvious statistical truth, McDavid has 14 points, Sherwood has nine. McDavid’s assist numbers are still elite. Sherwood hasn’t recorded a single one.Supporters didn’t hold back either: “It’s not even a conversation, no one compares to McDavid. I’m not an Edmonton fan but no one is better than this guy…that’s the only conversation. Period.” Others pointed at shot selection and decision-making: “McDavid is more concerned about making the perfect play/goal or deferring to a lesser goal scorer … If McD doesn’t get his usual 35-60 goals, Oilers may miss the playoffs!”Edmonton fans know the pattern. McDavid almost always ramps up. The Oilers aren’t built for October storylines, they’re built for April results. Right now? The stat that will matter most isn’t nine goals… it’s the one that comes next.Also Read: “Show me some fu**ing emotion”: Former Maple Leafs enforcer rips Auston Matthews’ leadership amid Leafs’ shaky October","A recent hat trick by Kiefer Sherwood sparked online debate, with some fans questioning why he had more goals than Connor McDavid early in the season.
