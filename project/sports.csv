Wayne Gretzky's attendance sparks unrelated controversy



Alex Ovechkin Breaks Gretzky's Record for Most Goals in NHL History üö®

Wayne Gretzky faces backlash over Kash Patel appearance



Alex Ovechkin etched his name into NHL history, scoring his 895th goal to surpass Wayne Gretzky ‚Äôs all-time record. But what should‚Äôve been a celebration of hockey greatness took an unexpected turn. The spotlight drifted from the ice to the stands, specifically to Gretzky‚Äôs guest, Kash Patel . The former government official‚Äôs appearance sparked a wave of political chatter, clouding what was meant to be a milestone moment in the sport.Here‚Äôs what happened: Gretzky, invited to witness Ovechkin‚Äôs history-making night, was spotted at recent Capitals games alongside Patel, a former U.S. government official with Republican ties. That detail, insignificant to some, became headline fodder across social media.Suddenly, instead of reflecting on the end of one era and the start of another, online chatter shifted to whether Gretzky‚Äôs presence next to Patel carried political weight. Some fans, particularly from Canada, voiced disappointment, questioning Gretzky‚Äôs silence on past political issues and reading into his choice of company.Frank Seravalli, a respected NHL insider, thought so. He was quick to dismiss the controversy, reminding fans that Patel isn‚Äôt some outsider looking for a photo op‚Äîhe‚Äôs a longtime hockey guy with actual time on the ice. According to Seravalli, dragging Gretzky into a political debate during a celebratory hockey moment is a misfire.Let‚Äôs not forget what actually happened on the ice. Ovechkin scored a power-play goal in the second period against the Islanders, a goal that not only broke Gretzky‚Äôs record but redefined the ceiling for future scorers.Gretzky handled the moment with quiet grace. He didn‚Äôt make it about himself. He didn‚Äôt push a narrative. He showed up, clapped, and passed the torch with a short message that was more personal than political. ‚ÄúI know how hard it is to get to 895,‚Äù he said, reflecting on his own kids being close in age to Ovechkin‚Äôs when he set the record.Also Read: Alex Ovechkin‚Äôs record ignites nostalgia as Penguins‚Äô Mike Sullivan remembers legends who built NHL It was hockey history in real time.

Sometimes, two hockey legends crossing paths should be just that, a handoff, not a headline.","Alex Ovechkin scored his 895th goal to surpass Wayne Gretzky's all-time record.

Head coach Michael Malone addresses Denver Nuggets' four-Game losing streak

There's something wrong with the Denver Nuggets . Even though they have the skills and the MVP, they fail when it means the most. It's clear that coach Michael Malone is upset, and Nikola Jokic 's statements make it sound like there are bigger problems at play. It's not just bad luck; it's turning into a pattern. There are not many days left in the normal season, so they can't make any mistakes.Head coach Michael Malone is raising concerns as the Denver Nuggets are experiencing their longest losing streak since March 2023. He stressed the importance of cutting out expensive errors, saying, ‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt lost 4 in a row in a long time... We put ourselves in this hole & we only have ourselves to pull ourselves out of it.‚ÄùThe Nuggets faced a tough defeat against the Indiana Pacers, losing 125-120 after giving up a 13-point advantage, which reflects their current challenges. Jokic had an impressive game with 41 points, 15 rebounds, and 13 assists, but he pointed out that turnovers were a significant concern.He shared his thoughts on the matter, ""Everybody had one or two 'It's my fault, it's my fault,' and that's 10 'my bads,' and that's basically 20 points or even more."" Jokic focused on the need for improved effort and attention to detail, adding, ""We all need to be better in those little extra efforts or just one more thing or make them do one more thing.This trend isn't anything new. During an intense double-overtime game against the Minnesota Timberwolves, Jokic's remarkable 61-point triple-double got lost in the shuffle due to some late-game mistakes, notably a crucial foul by Russell Westbrook that resulted in the free throws that decided the game.As the regular season winds down with just three games left, the Nuggets hold a 47-32 record, putting them in a tight spot at fourth in the Western Conference, only half a game above dropping to eighth.The Denver Nuggets are set to take on the Sacramento Kings on Wednesday, April 9, 2025, at 7:00 PM PDT. After dropping four straight games, the Nuggets really need this win to get back on track as the playoffs loom. Meanwhile, the Kings are eager to take advantage of the Nuggets' recent downturn.Also Read: Cleveland Cavaliers' franchise record shattered dashed after controversial call and loss to Sacramento Kings As the playoffs get closer, every mistake counts even more.

Olivier Rioux stands tall as redshirt freshman and becomes fan favorite

People are celebrating Florida's recent championship victory but the 7 '9 Canadian redshirt freshman Olivier Rioux stands as a fan favorite even though he has not played a single NCAA game. Rioux built his reputation through time at IMG Academy and Guinness World Records now recognizes him as he prepares to transform basketball history.Standing tall at 7-foot-9, Canadian freshman Olivier Rioux is set to make a big impact in college basketball as he prepares to debut with the University of Florida Gators . Even though he didn‚Äôt play during the Gators' recent NCAA Championship run, his presence has already stirred excitement, setting the stage for a remarkable entry into Division I basketball.The Florida Gators celebrated their third national title on April 7, 2025, after a tense 65-63 triumph over the Houston Cougars. Battling back from a 12-point deficit in the second half, the Gators proved their tenacity and spirit. Senior guard Walter Clayton Jr. was instrumental, scoring all 11 of his points post-halftime and executing a critical defensive stop in the final seconds to seal the win.Rioux may not have stepped onto the field this season due to his redshirt status, which is a smart strategy for skill development and extending his eligibility, but he was still a key part of the team's adventure. His tall frame on the sidelines attracted attention, and he quickly became a fan favorite during the Gators' tournament run.Originating from Terrebonne, Quebec, Rioux's journey to the NCAA is quite extraordinary. He exceeded 7 feet in height before finishing seventh grade and now holds the Guinness World Record for being the tallest teenager in the world. Before becoming a Gator, he trained at IMG Academy in Florida, where he evolved into a dominant center.Beyond his plans for college, Rioux is looking to represent Canada on the national team and might even consider a future in the NBA .

A goal for the ages: Alex Ovechkin breaks Wayne Gretzky's 26-year record



FULL Alex Ovechkin Celebration Ceremony After Record-Breaking Goal No. 895

A legacy passed down: Anastasia Shubskaya receives diamond tribute from Janet Gretzky



After Alex Ovechkin netted his 895th career goal and broke legendary Wayne Gretzky 's record, Janet Gretzky showed respect to a time-honored hockey tradition by gifting Anastasia Shubskaya , wife of Alex Ovechkin, an eight-carat diamond ring that had been estimated at $280,000. The Capitals may have lost to the New York Islanders by a score of 4-1, but the outcome was an afterthought to a night all about legacy, love, and a new chapter in hockey's history.The moment of history arrived at 7:26 of the second period. Alex Ovechkin let go of a blazing shot through fellow Russian Ilya Sorokin, making himself the NHL's all-time leading goal scorer. Fans inside UBS Arena lost their minds, and Alex Ovechkin commemorated the occasion by executing a belly flop onto the ice‚Äîcelebrating his big achievement.While Alex Ovechkin was absorbing the enormity of his achievement, Anastasia Shubskaya was gifted a symbolic token of the historic night. Continuing a tradition started in 1994, when Colleen Howe (wife of Gordie Howe) gave Janet Gretzky a diamond ring after her husband, Wayne Gretzky, broke Colleen Howe‚Äôs husband‚Äôs record, Janet Gretzky ensured history repeated itself‚Äîthis time from one hockey family to another.In an interview with the media, Wayne Gretzky said, ‚ÄúA month ago, my wife said, ‚ÄòYou know, Colleen Howe started a tradition. I‚Äôm not sure if anyone is going to break Alex‚Äôs record, but I want to give her (Ovechkin‚Äôs wife, Anastasia Shubskaya) something really unique.‚Äô So, we went out and she picked out an eight-diamond ring for Alex‚Äôs wife.

, Bengaluru weather prediction

Rajat Patidar-led Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) will lock horns against Axar Patel's Delhi Capitals (DC) in Match No 24 of the Indian Premier League (IPL) at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru. With three wins in as many games, DC are currently placed at the second place, while RCB are at the third position on the points table.RCB have mastered conditions as distinct as Kolkata, Chennai and Mumbai and their lone stumble came at home against Gujarat Titans. It was more to do with a rather out of character Chinnaswamy pitch taking them by surprise than any sudden erosion in skills.Royal Challengers Bangalore's in-form captain, Rajat Patidar , is expected to be a key player, particularly against spin. Delhi Capitals, therefore, will be looking to their left-arm spinner, Axar Patel, for a significant contribution. However, Patel has had a quiet start to the season, bowling only eight overs in three matches and failing to secure a wicket.The fitness of Faf du Plessis will be a key factor for Delhi Capitals, after he missed the game against CSK. If he is fit to open with Rahul, RCB's new ball bowlers will have to be on their game from ball one.The M. Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru is known for its characteristics that often lead to high-scoring T20 cricket matches. The pitch often provides good bounce and carry, which can assist fast bowlers, especially in the early overs. Dew can play a significant role in evening matches, making the ball slippery and challenging for bowlers.Virat Kohli, Phil Salt, Devdutt Padikkal , Rajat Patidar (c), Liam Livingstone, Jitesh Sharma (wk), Tim David, Krunal Pandya, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Josh Hazlewood, Yash Dayal,Rasikh SalamFaf du Plessis, Jake Fraser McGurk, Abishek Porel, KL Rahul (wk), Tristan Stubbs, Axar Patel (c), Vipraj Nigam, Mitchell Starc, Kuldeep Yadav, Mukesh Kumar, Mohit SharmaAshutosh SharmaRajat Patidar (c), Phil Salt, Virat Kohli, Devdutt Padikkal, Liam Livingstone, Jitesh Sharma (wk), Tim David, Krunal Pandya, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Josh Hazlewood, Yash Dayal, Suyash Sharma, Rasikh Dar Salam, Manoj Bhandage, Jacob Bethell, Swapnil Singh, Abhinandan Singh, Romario Shepherd, Lungi Ngidi, Nuwan Thushara, Mohit Rathee, Swastik Chikara.Axar Patel (c), Jake Fraser-McGurk, Faf du Plessis, Abishek Porel(w), Sameer Rizvi, Tristan Stubbs, Ashutosh Sharma, Vipraj Nigam, Mitchell Starc, Kuldeep Yadav, Mohit Sharma, Mukesh Kumar, Karun Nair, Donovan Ferreira, Tripurana Vijay, Darshan Nalkande, Dushmantha Chameera, KL Rahul, T Natarajan, Ajay Jadav Mandal, Manvanth Kumar L, Madhav Tiwari.311911The weather is expected to be partly to mostly cloudy during the match.

NEW DELHI: Rajasthan Royals Riyan Parag found himself at the centre of controversy during their Indian Premier League 2025 clash against Gujarat Titans at the Narendra Modi Stadium on Wednesday, after a disputed dismissal saw him exchanging words with the on-field umpire.Chasing a daunting 218-run target, Rajasthan were struggling early at 12 for 2 when Parag walked in to join skipper Sanju Samson . The pair steadied the innings with a crucial 48-run stand, until drama unfolded in the seventh over.Facing pacer Kulwant Khejroliya , Parag attempted to guide the ball to third man but appeared to edge the delivery through to wicketkeeper Jos Buttler . The Royals batter instantly opted for a DRS review. Replays showed a spike on UltraEdge as the ball passed the bat, prompting the third umpire to uphold the on-field decision.However, Parag was visibly dissatisfied, seemingly convinced the spike came from his bat grazing the ground rather than an edge. He paused on his way back, engaging in a brief but tense exchange with the umpire before reluctantly leaving the field.It marked the end of a promising innings and left Royals in trouble at 60 for 3 in 6.4 overs. Parag's reaction highlighted his frustration with the call.","Riyan Parag exchanged words with on-field umpire after disputed dismissal.

When and where to watch the Boston Celtics play tonight against the Orlando Magic (April 9, 2025)?

Thewill be without star forward Jayson Tatum for their matchup against the Orlando Magic on Wednesday due to a left ankle sprain. Tatum joins a lengthy injury list for the Celtics, who are already locked into the Eastern Conference‚Äôs No. 2 seed and are resting key players ahead of the playoffs.Boston‚Äôs overtime win over the New York Knicks on Tuesday improved their record to 59-20, but the team is taking a cautious approach with injuries. Alongside Jayson Tatum, Derrick White (left ankle sprain), Jrue Holiday (right shoulder impingement), Al Horford (right knee sprain), and Kristaps Porzingis (return from illness reconditioning) are all out. Jaylen Brown is listed as questionable with a right knee posterior impingement.With most of their starters sidelined, the Celtics will rely heavily on reserves against Orlando. The Magic, fighting to secure the No. 7 seed, are also dealing with injuries, including season-ending setbacks for Jalen Suggs (left knee) and Moe Wagner (torn ACL).Jayson Tatum‚Äôs absence is notable, given his role as Boston‚Äôs leading scorer. The ankle sprain isn‚Äôt considered serious, but with playoff positioning settled, the Celtics have no reason to rush him back. If Orlando advances past the Play-In Tournament, these teams could meet again in the first round.Wednesday‚Äôs game tips off at 7 p.m. ET in Orlando, marking the Magic‚Äôs final home game of the regular season. Fan Appreciation Night will also honor longtime PA announcer Paul Porter, who is retiring after 36 years with the franchise.For now, Boston‚Äôs focus shifts to health management, while the Magic aim to clinch a postseason berth.

Los Angeles Lakers vs Dallas Mavericks game details (April 9, 2025)

Thesquare off in one of the most anticipated matchups of the regular season, with playoff positioning and pride on the line. With LeBron James , Luka Doncic, and Anthony Davis potentially sharing the floor, all eyes will be on this Wednesday night showdown airing live on ESPN.Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the latest odds, key players, and why both teams believe they can come out on top. The Lakers have hit their stride at the perfect time. Coming off a dominant 126-99 win over the Oklahoma City Thunder, LA has now won two straight and looks poised to make a push for the No. 3 seed in the West. Despite playing on the second night of a back-to-back, the Lakers‚Äô depth was on full display in OKC.Key performers included:- LeBron James and Luka Doncic combining for 49 points- Austin Reaves adding 20 points- Role players like Dorian Finney-Smith and Gabe Vincent knocking down eight three-pointers between themThe Lakers are 44-33-2 against the spread this season and have proven to be one of the most consistent ATS teams in the league. At home, they‚Äôre dominant (30-10), but even on the road (18-20), recent performances suggest they‚Äôre peaking at the right moment.Luka‚Äôs impact since joining LA cannot be overstated. He‚Äôs averaging:- 27.3 points- 8.3 rebounds- 7.7 assists- 1.6 steals per gameHowever, opponents have found success when they force Luka to defend consistently, draining his energy for clutch-time scoring. Expect Dallas to target him early and often on defense.Dallas is fighting for a spot in the Play-In Tournament and desperately needs this win. The Mavericks are not dealing with the fatigue of a back-to-back and will be fully rested, unlike the Lakers. While they‚Äôve lost two straight and are 5-5 in their last 10 games, Anthony Davis's return changes everything.Important notes for Dallas:- Anthony Davis is probable and expected to play a major role- Kyrie Irving is out for the season- Jaden Hardy is ruled out- Dante Exum is a game-time decisionIf Davis is active and aggressive, he could be the game-changer Dallas needs. A 30+ point, 15-rebound, multi-block game is not out of the question. His head-to-head battle with LeBron will be one of the night‚Äôs biggest storylines.The Mavericks are 36-40-3 against the spread and 42-35-2 on totals, but they‚Äôve failed to cover in four consecutive games.Luka Doncic returns to Dallas‚Äîbut this time in purple and gold. The energy in the arena will be electric and emotionally charged. For many fans, this will be their first time rooting against Luka, a player they passionately supported for years.Doncic could respond in one of two ways:- Embrace the challenge and take over offensively- Defer to teammates and orchestrate from the backgroundEither way, the spotlight will be on him.The Mavericks opened as bigger underdogs, but sharp action trimmed the spread down to just five points. Despite that movement, the Lakers remain the better bet based on current form, depth, and recent momentum‚Äîeven with the back-to-back situation.Los Angeles has proven they can win tough road games and have more than enough firepower to cover this modest spread.Final pick: Lakers -5 (-112)Time: 7:30 PM ET / 4:30 PM PTTV: ESPNStreaming: fuboTV (free trial available)This matchup promises high-level intensity and star power. With playoff implications, personal rivalries, and emotions running high, Wednesday night‚Äôs game is must-watch TV.","The Lakers are 44-33-2 against the spread this season and have proven to be one of the most consistent ATS teams in the league.

Priyansh Arya 's fearless century lit up Mullanpur on Tuesday as the 24-year-old opener hammered the joint fourth-fastest hundred in IPL history, powering Punjab Kings to a crucial 18-run win over Chennai Super Kings . But more than the fireworks, it was his attitude that drew the loudest applause ‚Äî from none other than head coach Ricky Ponting Also See: GT vs RR, IPL Live Score Coming off a first-ball duck in the previous game, Arya bounced back in spectacular fashion, smashing 103 off 42 balls ‚Äî an innings laced with nine sixes and seven fours. He took Punjab from a shaky 83/5 to a formidable 219/6, the highest total ever recorded at the venue.Ponting, visibly moved in the post-match huddle at the team's dressing room, showered praise on Arya for the character he displayed. ""I've been around a lot of games of cricket. I haven‚Äôt seen many better knocks than what I saw tonight,"" said the former Australian skipper. ""You got out first ball last game, and yet the first ball today sails 100 metres over point for six. That says a lot about you and the attitude that we all want to have.""Ponting continued, ""Regardless of what happened last game, you stuck to your game. You displayed the attitude to put it back on the bowlers. From the first ball, you did that. Unbelievable knock.""Arya reached his maiden IPL hundred with a jaw-dropping assault on Matheesha Pathirana ‚Äî hitting him for three consecutive sixes and a four. Though he fell in the 13th over trying to clear long-on, his blitz had already turned the game. Shashank Singh (52* off 36) and Marco Jansen (34* off 19) added an unbeaten 65-run stand to close out the innings. Ponting didn‚Äôt miss the opportunity to laud them either.""To Shashank ‚Äî smart, calculating. You did what the team needed. That‚Äôs what I keep asking: ‚ÄòWhat does my team need from me right now?‚Äô You answered that perfectly,"" he said.On Jansen, Ponting added, ""Marco, very important runs. You even said at the time-out we could get to 220 ‚Äî and we got 219! We were 80 for 5, backs to the wall, and look what we did. That‚Äôs what good teams do.""With the win, Punjab Kings moved up to No. 4 on the table, and Arya proved he's more than a rising star ‚Äî he's the embodiment of a fearless, team-first mindset.","Priyansh Arya hits joint fourth-fastest hundred in IPL history.

Around 7am on Wednesday morning, Punjab Kings (PBKS) opener Priyansh Arya called up his childhood coach Sanjay Bharadwaj , hoping for compliments for his audacious 39-ball century against the Chennai Super Kings (CSK). However, he was in for a surprise as the coach stuck to his usual self.Also See: GT vs RR Live Score, IPL 2025 ""He asked me, 'Sir,? (Was it good?)' I shouted back and asked, '? (What was good?), you have done well in one match, don't get carried away,'"" says Bharadwaj.The conversation didn't stop there but became a one-way street as Priyansh could only respond with just ""yes sir"", ""no sir"" for the next ten minutes. Bharadwaj, one of the doyens of the domestic circuit who has shaped careers of Gautam Gambhir , Amit Mishra, Joginder Sharma, Nitish Rana and Unmukt Chand, revealed the message he gave to his ward after the maiden IPL hundred.""I told him this morning, '(Priyansh, if you play only with your hands, you will remain a labourer, like any normal cricketer. If you use your brain and hands, you will become an artisan, and the day you play with heart, using both your brain and hands, you will become a true artist),'"" says Bharadwaj.Fireworks were on display at the New PCA Cricket Stadium on Tuesday as the southpaw smashed nine sixes and hit seven boundaries during his 42-ball 103. For those who have followed his career from age-group days in Delhi, the approach isn't a surprise as that's the only way he knows to bat. The coach aptly sums it up as ""see the ball, hit the ball"".""It's just see-the-ball, hit-the-ball. If you give him any width, he will punish you. Only Khaleel (Ahmed) was getting some help from the surface, but he wasn't able to control it, and Priyansh made the most of it,"" said Bharadwaj on Priyansh's approach.Growing up, Arya was fortunate to see current India head coach and former India cricketer Gautam Gambhir train from close quarters at his academy. The youngster had once revealed how he never got the guts to speak to his hero but remained around him, watched his batting in the nets and was even part of the Delhi Ranji Trophy probables during Gambhir's last season.Priyansh's father, Pawan Arya , a school teacher at Delhi‚Äôs Government Sarvodaya Vidyalaya, Lancer Road, near Vishwavidyalaya metro station, explained how Gambhir's mentorship has helped his son grow.""Gautam has backed him since he scored 271 runs in an U-19 match. He has guided him in the last six-seven years. He has asked him to play as much as he can. He insisted he play in the Delhi League and the Hot Weather Tournament. It has helped Priyansh,"" says Pawan Arya.Bharadwaj further explained what impressed Gambhir the most about Priyansh Arya. ""Gambhir is sold on a player if he has an attitude. He doesn't believe in talent alone. He sees the intent. Even in Delhi cricket, over the years, he has backed Unmukt Chand, Navdeep Saini, Ayush Badoni, and Nitish Rana,"" he added.Gambhir is big on attitude and intent, and that's the prime reason why the likes of Harshit Rana and Nitish Kumar Reddy were fast-tracked into the Indian set-up and went on to make their Test debuts during the tour Down Under.Meanwhile, at the Arya's in Ashok Vihar, New Delhi, Pawan had to take a day off from work as he was busy attending guests. The plan for remainder of the week is simple - sit at home and watch the IPL.""I was so excited to see him play live in the IPL for the first time. Against Rajasthan Royals, I went to Chandigarh to watch him play, and he got out on the first ball for a duck. Yesterday, I was watching the match at home, and he scored a century. I guess I am the bad luck. Now I have decided I will never go and watch his games live,"" said Pawan with a laugh.Priyansh's dream is to play for India. This is where his father, his coach, and his mentor wants to see him. It's a long road but the youngster is moving in the right direction, and has an able support system, led by a hard taskmaster coach. It's just the start of runs and tons for the promising left-hander, and certainly not the end of Bharadwaj's epic one-liners.",Punjab Kings' Priyansh Arya scored his maiden IPL century against Chennai Super Kings.

When will CSK legend MS Dhoni retire from IPL? Astrologer Greenstone Lobo predicts

Punjab Kings (PBKS) spinner Yuzvendra Chahal has been a game-changer with the ball over the years, pulling off important dismissals under pressure. However, Chahal gave fans a glimpse of his fielding skills by pulling off a vital catch which resulted in MS Dhoni 's dismissal during PBKS' IPL 2025 match against Chennai Super Kings (CSK).Chahal managed to hold on to the ball despite fumbling initially, drawing a hilarious reaction from his team's captain Shreyas Iyer who was seen smiling but also looked stunned at the same time. Dhoni was dismissed in the 20th over of CSK's innings, hitting a low full toss by pacer Yash Thakur straight to Chahal at short fine leg.The CSK wicket-keeper batter smashed 27 runs off 12 balls in a knock comprising one four and three sixes. PBKS went on to record a triumph by 18 runs, pulling off their third win in four matches despite Chahal bowling just one over.""That was a tactical call because Shivam Dube and Devon Conway had already played a few deliveries. We know how destructive Dube can be. I felt that pacers bowling slower balls into the wicket would work and we basically wanted pace against Dube,"" said Shreyas during the post-match interaction.PBKS posted a total of 219 runs for the loss of six wickets following a century by opener Priyansh Arya who smashed 103 runs off 42 balls, in a knock comprising seven fours and nine sixes.

NEW DELHI: Former India cricketer Mohammad Kaif has questioned the growing trend of the ‚Äòretired out‚Äô tactic in the Indian Premier League, calling it more an act of frustration than strategy. His comments came after Chennai Super Kings retired out opener Devon Conway during their clash against Punjab Kings in Mullanpur on Tuesday.Also See: IPL Live Score, RR vs GT Conway, who was batting fluently on 69 off 49 balls, walked off in the 18th over as CSK chased a steep 220-run target. He was replaced by Ravindra Jadeja with 49 runs needed from just 13 balls. Despite the move, CSK fell short by 18 runs.This was the second instance this IPL season where a batter was tactically retired out. Earlier, Mumbai Indians pulled a similar move with Tilak Varma against Lucknow Super Giants ‚Äî they lost that game too.Reacting to the trend, Kaif posted on X: ""Teams using retired out option more out of frustration. It's a tactic that rarely works as there are very few batters who can hit a 6 on first ball they face.Most times it is the struggling batsman on crease who has a better chance of winning the game. Remember Tewatia he hit 5 sixes in 5 balls after he has made 8 runs off 19 balls.""Kaif‚Äôs take has reignited the debate over whether the ‚Äòretired out‚Äô rule is a useful innovation or a desperate gamble.",Former India cricketer Mohammad Kaif questions trend of'retired out' tactic in IPL.

Additionally, Rodriguez, ranked at number 5 in the featherweight division, talked about his routine during the layoff, his, Aaron Pico ‚Äôs addition to the UFC, and the debate of nationality.Yair Rodriguez, aka El Pantera, had quite a setback in his UFC career when he had two back-to-back losses. After being declared the interim champion of the featherweight division post his win against Josh Emmett, Rodriguez lost a title unification bout to Alexander Volkanovski and then a rematch with Brian Ortega. The setback pushed the fighter to take some time off from the Octagon. After the bout against Ortega, the fighter went on a long holiday with his girlfriend and visited 14 countries. This period was quite fun for Rodriguez. However, towards the end of the year, the fighter decided to change certain habits of his and decided to lead a better lifestyle.‚ÄúBy the end of the last year, I started changing like little bit. Started putting more time into the gym. I started changing my habits a little bit. Right towards by the end of the year, I completely changed everything‚Ä¶my bad habits. I completely erased all the bad things that I had been doing‚Ä¶I can actually see the progress, the progress in my body. In my head.‚ÄùThe fighter acknowledged how his brother is one of his biggest motivators and has been the driving force in reforming Rodriguez‚Äôs habits lately.

I started my career in the UFC in 2014, and now it‚Äôs 2025. I‚Äôve been living in the U.S. for over 10 years, my girlfriend is American, and I speak English‚Äîand now, because of that, I‚Äôm representing the American flag to gain followers. I love this country, but I‚Äôm not going to say I‚Äôm American. I‚Äôm not. I‚Äôm Mexican, and I‚Äôm proud of it.‚Äù The fighter added, ‚ÄúYes, I have a problem with that, not with Diego. He‚Äôs just doing his job with what he‚Äôs doing right now. My issue is, what‚Äôs up with people? I understand he‚Äôs great, he‚Äôs exciting, and he‚Äôs doing his job, but I just don‚Äôt agree with it.‚ÄùA win for both the fighters, Lopes and Rodriguez, in their respective bouts might land them facing each other this year itself at UFC 320 in Guadalajara. Rodriguez has kept a positive attitude towards it and stated, ‚ÄúMy visualization goes toward that. I‚Äôm obviously not overlooking this fight with Pitbull, but you have to be prepared for anything.

Ryan Donato turns up heat as Blackhawks search for accountability



Connor Bedard On Being Called a ""Generational Talent"" and More

Team identity crisis looms over Blackhawks' struggles



There‚Äôs losing ‚Äî and then there‚Äôs unraveling. The Chicago Blackhawks have officially crossed into the latter. With the clock ticking on a brutal NHL campaign, a blowout loss to the Pittsburgh Penguins may have done more than just add another L to the standings, it cracked the veneer of composure inside the locker room. What followed wasn‚Äôt quiet frustration. It was Ryan Donato , one of the team‚Äôs few bright spots this season, setting the tone with a message that couldn‚Äôt be ignored.The 5-0 shutout in Pittsburgh didn‚Äôt just sting, it exposed deeper issues brewing beneath the surface. In a rare and telling moment, the team held a players-only meeting immediately after the game. And when Donato stepped in front of the media, it was clear the message wasn‚Äôt sugarcoated.Without naming names, Donato called for full commitment from every player, every night, a standard that hasn‚Äôt been met nearly enough this year. His tone was measured, but the meaning was clear: half-efforts won‚Äôt cut it in the NHL, especially not on a team trying to build a future from the ashes of the present.While he didn‚Äôt single anyone out, his remarks felt like a challenge directed at both ends of the roster. The veterans who haven‚Äôt led by example. The young stars are still finding their place. And yes, perhaps even the franchise centerpiece Connor Bedard , who, despite a respectable point total, hasn‚Äôt had the same electric impact he showed early in his career.Donato, who‚Äôs quietly chasing a career-best season, seems less interested in personal accolades and more focused on setting a tone of urgency. It‚Äôs not just about salvaging the last few games, it‚Äôs about drawing a line in the sand. Who‚Äôs ready to dig in? Who‚Äôs willing to lead, not just talk?Also Read: Connor McDavid‚Äôs playoff clock is ticking ‚Äî Are the Oilers ready without him? As the Blackhawks stare down a long offseason, Donato‚Äôs fire may be exactly what this locker room needs. Not to rescue a lost year, that ship has sailed, but to start building a new one. One where effort is non-negotiable, leadership isn‚Äôt optional, and mediocrity doesn‚Äôt get a pass.In Chicago, the rebuild is real but without accountability, it‚Äôs just empty talk. Donato made sure of that.","The Chicago Blackhawks lost 5-0 to the Pittsburgh Penguins on Tuesday night. After the game, the team held a players-only meeting.

A magnificent 82-run knock ‚Äì which included eight fours and three sixes ‚Äì by classy opener Sai Sudharsan who‚Äôs in sublime form, was the centrepiece of the Gujarat Titans ‚Äô (GT) comprehensive 58-run win over the Rajasthan Royals (RR) at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad on Wednesday night.Asked to bat first by the Royals, GT, powered by Sudharsan‚Äôs brilliance and their positive approach, raced away to 217 for six in 20 overs. Under the pressure of a big target, RR folded up at 159 in 19.2 overs, with only Shimron Hetmeyer (52, 32b, 4x4, 3x6) and skipper Sanju Samson (41, 28b, 4x4, 2x6) offering some resistance.Giving another evidence of his much-improved T20 bowling, GT pacer Prasidh Krishna took 3 for 24 in four overs. Experienced leggie Rashid Khan shrugged off his poor run with a fine spell (2 for 37 in four overs) and left-arm spinner Sai Kishore (2 for 20 in 2.2 overs) kept his good run going.On a roll currently, Gujarat Titans thus recorded their fourth straight win to go top the table. RR suffered their third defeat in five matches this season.Apart from a fine knock, Sudharsan took two good catches in the deep to send back Dhruv Jurel (5) and Maheesh Tkeeksshana (5). Batting like a dream, the 23-year-old has made a case for himself for a recall into India‚Äôs T20 side, having racked up 273 runs in five matches at an average of 54.60 and a strike rate of 151.66. He is the second-highest run-getter in IPL 2025 so far, with only Lucknow Super Giants‚Äô Nicholas Pooran (288) ahead of him.While Sudharsan ‚Äòanchored‚Äô GT‚Äôs charge with his third half-century of the season, Jos Buttler (36, 25b, 5x4) and Shahrukh Khan (36, 20b, 4x4, 2x6) chipped in with power-packed cameos. Rahul Tewatia (24 not out, 12b) provided the finishing touches in the end.The beauty of Sudharsan‚Äôs knock was that he enabled GT to overcome a fiery spell by RR‚Äôs English paceman Jofra Archer, who dislodged Shubman Gill‚Äôs off stump in the third over, beating the batter who missed the line of an in-swinger completely. Then, a 152.3 kmph thunderbolt by Archer, who has bounced back amazingly well after being clobbered in his first two matches, saw the ball take a rushed Sudharsan‚Äôs top edge on the way to the boundary, but the youngster wasn‚Äôt rattled.A blazing counterattack by Sudharsan and Buttler saw the duo adding 80 runs for the second wicket in just 47 balls. Archer greeted the former England white-ball captain with a sharp bouncer, but Buttler responded with a cracking cover drive. Letting himself loose, Sudharsan charged down to Fazalhaq Farooqi and ramped him over third man for a six in the fourth over and then ramped Tushar Deshpande for another maximum in the next over.The 23-year-old left-hander later sliced Sharma for a six in the 17th over, displaying the power of his steely wrists.","Gujarat Titans beat Rajasthan Royals by 58 runs to go top of IPL.

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee ‚Äî Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match ‚Äî before the Nagpur ODI ‚Äî more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‚ÄòHitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

Justin Fields reacts to Jets QB rumors with calm confidence and a message to any incoming rookie



Jets Justin Fields: Higher Expectations than Fans & Media + Won't Talk About New York Drafting QB

Justin Fields has officially entered a critical new chapter in his NFL journey, this time donning the green and white of the New York Jets. Signing a two-year, $40 million contract‚Äî$30 million of it guaranteed‚Äîthe former first-round pick arrives in New York hoping to finally claim a long-term starting role after turbulent stints in Chicago and Pittsburgh. But even before he‚Äôs taken a meaningful snap at MetLife Stadium, Fields finds himself caught in a cloud of speculation as the Jets hold the No. 7 overall pick in this month‚Äôs NFL Draft.The Jets' quarterback woes have become something of a franchise identity. What was supposed to be a fairytale run with Aaron Rodgers turned into a nightmare, ending before it began due to injury. That fallout led the team to pursue Justin Fields, a dual-threat QB with undeniable raw talent but a track record still marred by inconsistency. In 50 career games, Fields owns a 14‚Äì30 record with 45 touchdowns and 31 interceptions‚Äînumbers that show flashes of brilliance but not the consistency of a franchise cornerstone.The uncertainty surrounding Fields‚Äô standing in New York was further amplified when a reporter recently asked how he would react if the Jets used their top pick on a quarterback. His answer was short, but it revealed plenty.‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really like to answer rhetorical questions,‚Äù Fields responded, via SNY. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm willing to teach, but I‚Äôm not really interested in rhetorical questions.‚ÄùIt wasn‚Äôt just a dodge‚Äîit was a statement. After being replaced by Caleb Williams in Chicago and benched in favor of Russell Wilson in Pittsburgh, Fields appears tired of speculation and eager to focus on proving his value on the field rather than defending it off of it.The Jets, however, aren‚Äôt showing their hand just yet. With prospects like Shedeur Sanders and Jaxson Dart potentially available, New York could still pull the trigger on a young quarterback, viewing Fields as a bridge rather than the long-term solution. If that happens, it‚Äôs easy to understand why Fields might feel blindsided‚Äîhe just arrived, after all, and it‚Äôs reasonable to believe he was promised a fair shot to start.Fields isn‚Äôt a grizzled veteran tasked with mentoring the next big thing; he‚Äôs a 26-year-old still trying to prove he is that big thing. While he has more experience than most rookies, he‚Äôs in no position to serve as a placeholder or coach-in-cleats. He's in New York to compete, to lead, and perhaps most importantly, to finally cement his place as a reliable starting quarterback.Whether the Jets will give him that opportunity without a fresh challenge from a drafted QB remains to be seen. Their actions in the draft will speak louder than any promise made behind closed doors. But for now, Justin Fields is focused on the task at hand‚Äînot hypotheticals, not distractions, and certainly not rhetorical questions.Also Read: Steelers eye surprise move that could instantly please Aaron Rodgers by reuniting him with a Jordy Nelson clone","Justin Fields signed a two-year, $40 million contract with the New York Jets.

BENGALURU: Coming in at No. 6 in the 16th over against Mumbai Indians on Monday, Jitesh Sharma got going against Trent Boult following up a boundary with a maximum. In fact, the Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) wicketkeeper-bat scored 24 off eight Boult deliveries. He even picked up a loose ball from Jasprit Bumrah to send it into the long-on stands during his unbeaten 19-ball 40.Sharma‚Äôs repertoire of shots garnered a lot of attention. A utility player of high value, Sharma, who was roped in by RCB for Rs 11 crore this season, came into his own with the Punjab Kings in 2022. At RCB, Dinesh Karthik has taken the 31-year-old under his wings and the result ‚Äî from one finisher to another ‚Äî is telling.Sharma, a like-to-like replacement to Karthik ‚Äî who hung up his boots after last season ‚Äî worked extensively with the now RCB batting coach during the off-season. On the eve of RCB‚Äôs home game against Delhi Capitals, Sharma spoke about Karthik‚Äôs role in reshaping his game.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a great journey till now. During the off-season I worked hard with him (Karthik). The shots I am playing right now are a replica of what he used to play. He is trying to turn me into a new player because he believes that I can play all around the circle.‚ÄùAfter an underwhelming 2024 season, Sharma emphasised on the mental blocks he has been able to clear.‚ÄúLast year‚Äôs performance was because of mental issues. I was not mentally in the game because I was thinking ahead and about the future. When I met Dinesh bhai, he told me that it‚Äôs a human error. It‚Äôs not rocket science; it happens to everyone,‚Äù he explained.Having sorted his mental demons, Sharma also revealed that confidence building is a part of his training regime.‚ÄúMy confidence doesn‚Äôt rely on the score. It always depends on my process and how I train. It‚Äôs because, if I have confidence in the end result, then the variables go up and down. So, I mostly keep my confidence high during practice,‚Äù he added.",Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) wicketkeeper-bat scored 24 off eight Boult deliveries.

BENGALURU: Thanks to the auction process, players in the Indian Premier League (IPL) regularly come up against their old teams, some with a sense of nostalgia and others with, perhaps, revenge in mind. Regardless, little love is lost as they pursue IPL glory and its riches.Mohammed Siraj, currently with Gujarat Titans, is a case in point as he made an emotional return to the M Chinnaswamy Stadium last week and did enough to hand Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) their first loss in three matches. Emotions will run high again when unbeaten Delhi Capitals (DC) take on RCB on Thursday.Several DC players have a connection with RCB and their home ground. There is Faf du Plessis, who led RCB for three seasons until the franchise relinquished their hold on him ahead of the auction last year. The 40-year-old missed out on silverware but came close to etching his name as RCB‚Äôs most famous captain since he led the team into two playoffs. He scored more than 400 runs in each season, a remarkable 730 runs in 2023 being the highlight.Du Plessis, now deputy to Axar Patel in DC, could add a few more at a ground that was his second home not long ago, though his fitness remains a concern. He sat out the previous game against Chennai Super Kings due to a groin niggle.Capitals‚Äô assistant coach Matthew Mott was non-committal on du Plessis‚Äôs availability.‚ÄúThe beauty of the schedule so far is we‚Äôve had some really good breaks and Faf‚Äôs had a good break. He‚Äôll get assessed today by the physios with a view to playing. To the naked eye, he certainly looks like he‚Äôs moving around a lot better.‚ÄùThen, there is Australian pace merchant Mitchell Starc, who cut his teeth in the IPL with RCB in 2014. The left-arm pacer picked up 34 wickets in two seasons before a foot fracture ruled him out of the 2016 edition.KL Rahul is another who returns to his home ground with a new team again this season. The stylish batter, who missed the opening match due to the birth of his daughter, scored a match-winning 51-ball 77 in the previous contest against CSK. Rahul, who spent four seasons at RCB, was widely speculated to return home at the auction but was snapped up by DC for Rs 14 crore.Both the teams come into the contest on the back of wins, with RCB prevailing in a tense defence of their tall total against Mumbai Indians at the Wankhede Stadium on Monday. While skipper Rajat Patidar and Virat Kohli scored crucial half-centuries, the takeaways from the match were the return to form of southpaw Devdutt Padikkal and wicketkeeper Jitesh Sharma‚Äôs game-changing unbeaten 19-ball 40.Barring leggie Suyash Sharma and pace ace Josh Hazlewood, all the other bowlers conceded runs, especially in the second half of Mumbai‚Äôs innings, but they managed to soak up the pressure at the death.This new-look RCB have got a lot off their back.
