Denver Nuggets' Streak Snapped: Four Los Angeles Lakers Players Score 20+ Points in 123-100 Romp



Remember when the Denver Nuggets looked invincible? Like a superhero on a nine-game winning streak, they were soaring higher than a Taylor Swift concert ticket price. But just like every superhero movie needs a good villain, the Los Angeles Lakers swooped into Denver and played the role of kryptonite. Think Thanos snapping his fingers, but instead of half the universe disappearing, it was the Nuggets' winning streak vanishing into thin air. The final score? A resounding 123-100 victory for the purple and gold. But this wasn't just a win, it was a statement. A declaration that the Lakers are not to be trifled with.Leading the charge were four Lakers, each scoring 20+ points, like a basketball version of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse descending upon the Nuggets' defense. Luka Doncic , channeling his inner Zeus, rained down 32 points. LeBron James , ever the king, added a regal 25. Rui Hachimura , in a dramatic turn of events, contributed 21 points, a feat made even more impressive considering a mid-game injury scare that had Laker Nation holding its breath. And let's not forget Austin Reaves , who also chipped in with 21 points, proving that even the underdogs can bite.But just like a phoenix rising from the ashes (or, you know, a basketball player returning from the locker room), Hachimura returned. Hachimura's return wasn't just symbolic, it was impactful. He finished the game with 21 points, four assists, and a steal, shooting 58.3 percent from the field. He was raining three-pointers like confetti at a New Year's Eve party.Furthermore, LeBron James added 25 points, nine rebounds, five assists, and three blocks, while the Lakers limited their turnovers to just eight, while the Nuggets committed 20. After the game, James shared a head-turning analogy about the growing chemistry between him and Doncic as they continue to grow as teammates together. (via NBA ""I'm a natural-born wide receiver, and he's a natural-born quarterback, so it fits perfectly,"" James said.ALSO READ: Why Is Elgin Baylor Being Celebrated Now?

NEW DELHI: Indian all-rounder Hardik Pandya on Sunday reached a significant milestone, claiming his 200th international wicket across formats. He achieved this feat during India's crucial ICC Champions Trophy clash against Pakistan in Dubai.Known for his explosive batting and effective seam bowling, Hardik has been a vital asset for India across all formats. He was at his best during the match, delivering an impressive spell of 2/31 in eight overs at an economy rate of 3.87.He dismissed Pakistan’s star batter Babar Azam, who was in attacking form, and later removed a well-set Saud Shakeel , who had reached a half-century.In 216 international matches, Hardik has taken 200 wickets at an average of 30.76, with his best figures being 5/28 — his only five-wicket haul in international cricket.

However, their dismissals triggered another collapse before a late cameo from Khushdil Shah (38) provided a much-needed boost on a sluggish pitch.Pakistan's innings wrapped up in 49.4 overs, with India's left-arm wrist spinner Kuldeep Yadav shining with figures of 3/40.","Hardik Pandya claimed his 200th international wicket against Pakistan.

Cooper Flagg's Performance Highlights Duke's Historic Win Over Illinois

A new era of Blue Devil dominance is upon us, and it's led by a player drawing comparisons to everyone from Jayson Tatum to a young LeBron. This past Saturday, at the Mecca of basketball, Madison Square Garden , Duke didn't just win, they put on a show that would make even the Globetrotters blush, dismantling the Illinois Fighting Illini 110-67 in a performance for the ages. Think of it as a basketball equivalent of a Kanye concert crashing a Lollapalooza headline setThe buzz surrounding Cooper Flagg, the projected No. 1 pick in the 2025 NBA Draft, was deafening heading into the Sentinel One Classic. And while Flagg delivered, showcasing his dazzling array of skills with 16 points, seven rebounds, and five assists, including a couple of dunks that nearly took the roof off the Garden, this Duke victory was far from a one-man show.Under the tutelage of Jon Scheyer , who is proving to be a worthy successor to Coach K, the Blue Devils unleashed a balanced attack that left Illinois reeling. Sion James , not known for his long-range prowess, channeled his inner Steph Curry , nailing two early three-pointers. Tyrese Proctor and Isaiah Evans sliced and diced through the Illini defense, combining for 20 points. Even future draft picks Kon Knueppel and Khaman Maluach contributed.Duke's defense was a suffocating force, holding Illinois to a dismal 2-for-26 from beyond the arc. This was a team that averaged nearly ten three-pointers a game, completely neutralized by Duke’s relentless pressure. Questions about Duke's strength of schedule in the ACC and earlier losses to Kentucky and Kansas were emphatically answered. This team has evolved. They've gelled. They've found their identity. They’re not just a collection of talented individuals, they're a team, playing with a purpose.ALSO READ: Four Los Angeles Lakers Starters Score 20+ Points to Defeat Denver Nuggets: Ended Nine-Game Win Streak If Saturday night was any indication, that purpose is to cut down the nets in San Antonio.

have seemingly bounced back as they have secured a stunning win against theon Thursday night. At 40 years old, on the second night of a back-to-back, the four-time NBA champion, LeBron James delivered a jaw-dropping 40-point performance to lead the Los Angeles Lakers to a 121-112 win over the Portland Trail Blazers. His efforts left Lakers head coachboth stunned and inspired, as he showered James with praise following the game. LeBron James has recently dealt with lingering injuries and only confirmed fit to play hours before tipoff but showed no signs of slowing down. He shot an efficient 14-for-24 from the field, including 4-of-8 from beyond the arc, and added eight rebounds and four assists.Head coach JJ Redick , who has always been a vocal admirer of James’ work ethic and longevity, couldn’t hold back his admiration for the legend. Speaking to reporters in a post-game presser, he shared his honest thoughts on the King’s astonishing performance.“He really just defies anything that's normal, and not just the physical feats and the plays—it’s the mentality,” Redick said. “He is—I believe I saw the other day he's a billionaire—and he's playing on the second night of a back-to-back at 40 after 22 years with every record and every accolade.”Redick continued his witty remark, “And the kids will say that I'm glazing him. He's one of the greatest competitors. [Assistant coach] Nate [McMillan] and I were talking before the game—he's amazing to coach. He brings it every single day, he sets the standard for how you're supposed to approach this craft. That’s to me the most incredible thing—the mindset to do it, get up the next day, do it, over and over again.”James’ ability to maintain this level of excellence post-40 has been undeniably top of the word, according to fan analysts. For two decades, he has maintained his stature as a standout star and forged his legacy with a stunning resume to his name.Additionally, James has just added another milestone in his career. By playing his 1,542nd game, he passed Vince Carter to claim third place on the NBA’s all-time games played list. Now, only Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (1,560) and Robert Parish (1,611) stand ahead of him. The 1 billion-rich athlete (per Forbes) is currently averaging 24.7 points per game, 7.7 rebounds, and 8.9 assists. James also holds the youngest and oldest NBA star to score 40 points in a game.Also Read: Los Angeles Lakers legend LeBron James creates another milestone surpassing Vince Carter A huge part of the Lakers’ success against Portland also came from Austin Reaves in the recent game against the Trail Blazers.

Additionally, he became the fastest Indian to achieve the milestone in terms of matches played, breaking the previous record held by Ajit Agarkar.Indian skipper Rohit Sharma also achieved a significant milestone in the match, becoming the second-fastest batsman in ODI history to reach 11,000 runs. He accomplished this feat in 11,868 balls, trailing only behind Virat Kohli’s record of 11,831 balls.With this victory, India now shifts its focus to the much-anticipated clash against Pakistan, their arch-rivals and defending champions.

NEW DELHI: India and Pakistan are set to face off in a highly anticipated clash at the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy in Dubai on Sunday. This match holds significant importance for both teams in their pursuit of a semi-final berth from Group A.India, led by Rohit Sharma , commenced their campaign with a convincing six-wicket victory over Bangladesh at Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Wednesday. In contrast, the defending champions, Pakistan, suffered a 60-run loss against New Zealand in the tournament opener at the National Stadium in Karachi earlier this week.For Pakistan, this encounter is a must-win situation to keep their semi-final hopes alive, while a win for India would almost guarantee them a spot in the last four of the eight-team marquee event.In their previous ODI meeting during the 2023 World Cup in Ahmedabad, India emerged victorious by seven wickets, with captain Rohit and Shreyas Iyer scoring half-centuries. However, India faced a setback in their encounter against Pakistan in the 2017 Champions Trophy final at The Oval, where they missed out on their second title in the tournament.Also See: India vs Pakistan Head to Head Records Despite this, India hold a psychological edge, having remained unbeaten against Pakistan in their last six ODIs, including the 2023 Asia Cup group stage washout, since 2018.The two teams last met in the 2024 T20 World Cup group stage match in New York, where India emerged victorious by nine runs. Jasprit Bumrah 's impressive figures of 3/14 earned him the Player of the Match award, and India went on to win the title, defeating South Africa in the final to claim their second T20 World Cup trophy after their triumph in 2007 edition under MS Dhoni.Rohit Sharma (c), Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul (wk), Axar Patel, Hardik Pandya Ravindra Jadeja , Mohammed Shami, Harshit Rana, Kuldeep YadavImam-ul-Haq, Babar Azam , Saud Shakeel, Mohammad Rizwan (c/wk), Agha Salman, Kamran Ghulam, Khushdil Shah, Shaheen Afridi, Naseem Shah, Haris Rauf, Abrar AhmedA prolific opener with a knack for big hits, Rohit showed glimpses of his power-hitting abilities against Bangladesh. Known for his experience and leadership are crucial in high-pressure games, the Indian skipper will be aiming to dominate pace and spin alike, making him a game-changer at the top.Known for his hunger for runs, Kohli thrives in chases and high-stakes encounters. Despite undergoing a lean patch in white-ball cricket currently, Kohli remains India's supreme source of temperament, making him one of the most reliable batters in ODI cricket.Having scored a half-century in a losing cause during the tournament opener, Pakistan’s batting mainstay Babar will be looking to pose a threat against India's bowling attack. His ability to anchor an innings and accelerate when needed is vital for Pakistan’s success.A lethal left-arm pacer, Shaheen had a torrid tournament opener against Kiwis.

Champions Trophy 2025: India, Pakistan apply final touches before blockbuster

Former Indian captain MS Dhoni was spooted watching the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 match between India and Pakistan at Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Sunday, February 23.The high-profile match drew attention from the cricket community as leading players from both teams participated in the game.Dhoni was observed enjoying the match during an advertisement shoot break.A viral social media video captured him alongside Bollywood actor Sunny Deol , as they engaged in conversation while surrounded by fans.In the match proceedings, Pakistan's Mohammad Rizwan won the toss and chose to bat first. Pakistan made a strong start with Babar Azam showing excellent form from the beginning, hitting five boundaries.Azam's batting approach differed significantly from his previous game where he scored fifty runs in 81 balls. He displayed aggressive intent by attacking Axar Patel early, advancing down the pitch to hit a four towards long on.However, Hardik Pandya cut short Azam's promising innings. The all-rounder induced an outside edge from Azam with a good length delivery moving away, which was caught by wicketkeeper KL Rahul. Pandya gave Azam a send-off gesture as he departed.Following Azam's dismissal, Imam-ul-Haq was run out for 10 runs from 26 balls, thanks to a direct hit by Axar Patel from mid-on position. This left Pakistan at 47 runs for 2 wickets after 9.2 overs.Mohammad Rizwan and Saud Shakeel then stabilised Pakistan's innings with a 104-run partnership.However, Pakistan's momentum was arrested with three wickets in quick succession - across 14 runs in three overs - despite two dropped chances in the Indian camp.At the time of writing, Pakistan were 183/5 in 40 overs.","MS Dhoni watched the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 match between India and Pakistan at Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Sunday, February 23.

Who is this cricketer helping Pakistan prepare for big match vs India | Champions Trophy update from Dubai

NEW DELHI: Pakistan's star batter Babar Azam was conspicuously absent from the team's training session ahead of their high-stakes Champions Trophy clash against India on Sunday, fueling speculation about his availability for the crucial encounter. Even as doubts lingered over Azam's participation, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chief Mohsin Naqvi delivered a clear directive to the team — win “at any cost.”Azam, who faced heavy criticism for his sluggish 90-ball 64 in Pakistan's 60-run loss to New Zealand, was the only player missing from Saturday evening's practice session. His absence raised questions, especially with PCB chief Naqvi in attendance. Interim head coach Aaqib Javed , addressing the media post-session, downplayed concerns, stating that Azam had chosen to rest.Naqvi's presence at the Dubai International Stadium underscored the immense pressure on Pakistan. With their tournament hopes hanging by a thread, he urged the team to give their all against arch-rivals India. PTI reported citing reliable sources that Naqvi told the players to silence their critics — himself included — with a victory.The practice session, initially planned for two hours, was cut short as Naqvi held discussions with captain Mohammad Rizwan, coach Aaqib Javed, and key players, including pacers Shaheen Shah Afridi and Haris Rauf. Reports suggest the PCB chief was unhappy with the team's selection and took time to personally interact with each player and support staff.Speaking to the media later, Naqvi asserted that Pakistan was ready to take on India. ""It will be a great game. Our team is fully prepared, and in my opinion, they are in good form. We stand with them, whether they win or lose,"" he said.India refused to travel to Pakistan due to security concerns, leading to their Champions Trophy matches being relocated to Dubai. If India reach the final, it will also be played in Dubai, despite Pakistan technically hosting the tournament.With Babar Azam's status uncertain and the PCB chief demanding an all-out effort, Pakistan's match against India is set to be a high-voltage affair, both on and off the field.","Pakistan's star batter Babar Azam was conspicuously absent from the team's training session ahead of their high-stakes Champions Trophy clash against India.

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan captain Sarfaraz Ahmed believes Indian cricket stars Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma should continue their international careers and make their own decisions about retirement.The future of India captain Rohit and veteran batsman Kohli came under scrutiny following consecutive Test series losses to New Zealand and Australia, where both players struggled with the bat.""People should not even talk about Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma. Their performances have been outstanding for India,"" Ahmed told reporters on Sunday.""Virat Kohli has won those matches for India, and I have seen it with my own eyes, you can't imagine, the kind of performances he has produced for India.""The same goes for Rohit Sharma. The way he is leading the team. He led the team outstandingly in the 2023 (ODI) World Cup and won the T20 World Cup.""Ahmed suggested that India should build their teams around the two players until they decide to retire from various formats.""Let them play and let them decide what they want to do. You should make your team around them. The way they bid adieu to T20Is, they will do it for other formats when they will feel it is time. You should not make a team be removing them, you should make teams by including them,"" he said.Ahmed also advocated for Pakistan to structure their team around Babar Azam.""Babar Azam is a different player. I think they should set up the (Pakistan) team in a way that Babar Azam can play full 50 overs like Virat Kohli does for India. He takes time in the beginning and then runs the game,"" he said.""His (Babar's) goal should be to play the full 50 overs at one-down or whatever number he bats and there should be (other) batters around him who can take on the game and Babar can take care of the other end,"" he added.Ahmed also expressed that Indian cricketers, currently play their matches in Dubai, would recieve a lot more love and admiration in Pakistan.""I will tell you the general view of the Pakistani people - they want to see the Indian team in Pakistan,"" he said.""The people of Pakistan love India and their cricketers a lot and they respect them a lot. The way international cricket has returned to Pakistan in the last 7-8 years. Steve Smith, Kane Williamson, Pat Cummins and other top stars of world cricket have played in Pakistan.""The Pakistani people want the Indian team to come to Pakistan and they will get a lot of love there. They should come, everything is (going) very good. The whole tournament ( Champions Trophy ) is being organised well and everything is being held safely,"" he said.Ahmed said there is no difference between people in the port cities of Karachi and Mumbai.""I think there is no difference. Our only problem is the line, our culture is the same. If you talk, I live in Karachi. The style of the people of Karachi and Mumbai is exactly the same,"" he said.""We also speak fast there. I also speak fast. So it's all the same. I remember very well, in Delhi, I went to the old sadar (market) in 2007.

This match is being played in Dubai after India declined to travel to Pakistan, the tournament's host nation.Pakistan will be under pressure in front of an anticipated full house at the 25,000-seat Dubai International Stadium, with hundreds of millions more people riveted to their TVs.Realistically, Mohammad Rizwan 's team needs to defeat favorites India in order to go to the semi-finals of the eight-nation event after losing badly to New Zealand by 60 runs in the first match of the ODI competition in Karachi.On a higher run-rate, New Zealand leads Group A ahead of India, who defeated Bangladesh by six wickets on Thursday. Pakistan sits at the bottom of the group, in fourth place.The semi-finals will be played by the top two teams in each of the two groups.""If we want to win against the great teams of the world and be one of the great teams of the world we will have to bring consistency,"" Pakistan batsman Salman Ali Agha said.""We can't play well in one game and bad in another.""Last week in a tri-nation event at home, Pakistan lost to New Zealand in the final, crashing to 242 all out after chasing down a record 353 against South Africa.Their top batsman, Fakhar Zaman , sustained a muscular injury on Wednesday, which dealt them a serious blow in the defeat.

I don't think you need to think too much about the ICC tournament or any international match.""The same confidence was displayed by fellow pace bowler Harshit Rana, who took three wickets in his team's victory.""It's great to perform ahead of the Pakistan match and hopefully I can take this momentum forward,"" said Rana. ""But the Pakistan match is just another game for us.""","Pakistan play bitter rivals India in a Champions Trophy thriller on Sunday.

The high-octane Champions Trophy 2025 clash between India and Pakistan at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium had no shortage of drama.

Are India-Pakistan contests overhyped? | ICC Champions Trophy 2025 | IND vs PAK

Virat Kohli scored an unbeaten century in India's win against Pakistan in the Champions Trophy. (PTI)

Champions Trophy: 'Any victory against Pakistan is sweet,' says Shreyas Iyer

LIVE from Dubai: It’s that man Virat Kohli, AGAIN. India humiliate Pakistan in Champions Trophy

Another ODI run-chase, another hundred, another win and the story continues...When the helmet came off and the bat was pointed towards the stands, Virat Kohli was not just celebrating his 51st ODI hundred but also another clinical run-chase as India outclassed Pakistan in the Champions Trophy by six wickets. An assuring gesture for his childhood coach Rajkumar Sharma, who was in attendance at the Dubai International Stadium , followed and he then turned towards the dressing room to acknowledge the applause.The King was back in his elements, back to his dominant best, back to calculating and mastering run chases and back to the showmanship. Nobody, nobody does it better than Kohli in this format and his control during run-chases can be a case study for future generations.The risk element is completely eliminated as he prefers to pick the gaps and avoids the flashy, airy approach unless there's a desperate need for it. The ones effortlessly become twos and the fielders in the ring are kept on their toes as a quick-single is always on the cards. Alarm bells start ringing for the opposition if the cover-drives connect and it happened twice during a Haris Rauf over early in Kohli's innings. While the first was a more cautious check shot, the other was way more fluent and would have switched the Chase Master™ on in the big game vs Pakistan.He thrives in situations like these and Sunday was another reminder of why he remains the absolute beast in 50-over cricket. The staggering numbers are a testament to that but more than the numbers, it's how he he builds a run-chase and then controls it. Even when the boundaries don't come, the sprints between the wickets keep his strike-rate hovering in the 90s and there were as many as 46 singles and 13 doubles during his unbeaten hundred. The fitness levels were tested under the unforgiving sun but in spite of staying on the field for more than 85 overs, he was pushing for those doubles towards the fag end of the chase.In a chat with the broadcaster after the match, Kohli spoke about the knock, keeping the ""noise away"" and how the next few days will be about keeping the feet up and recharging the batteries before India's last group stage fixture vs New Zealand on March 2.""My job was to control the middle overs against the spinners without taking too many risks, towards the end Shreyas accelerated and I got a few boundaries as well. It allowed me to play my usual ODI game. I have a decent understanding of my game, it is about keeping the outside noise away, staying in my space and taking care of my energy levels and thoughts,"" said Kohli.""To be honest, at 36, it feels really good. Will put my feet up for a few days as it takes a lot out of me to put that kind of effort into every game,"" he added.The story is set to continue for a bit longer as the protagonist still has enough gas in the tank. He scaled Mt 14,000 on Sunday, scored his 82nd hundred in international cricket , collected a record Player of the Match award but it was just another day of Kohli doing Kohli things.","Virat Kohli scored an unbeaten century in India's win against Pakistan in the Champions Trophy.

Century no 51 in the ODIs-two more than the legendary Sachin Tendulkar 's 49, and the first since the landmark No 50 came, with Tendulkar watching, at the Wankhede Stadium in the 2023 World Cup semifinals against New Zealand.Soon after hitting the boundary which took him past his ton and India to a seven-wicket win over a listless Pakistan, Kohli took his helmet off and looked towards the skies, and then asked his captain, Rohit Sharma to calm down, since he was there in the middle!Shrugging off all talk about his ability to play spin, 'King Kohli,' who trained for an extra couple of hours on the eve of this match against the local spinners with India's batting coaches to help him out, roared back into form in grand style when it mattered in the big game-or is an India versus Pakistan match even a big game anymore considering that India cruise through it nowadays without much challenge?Unleashing his vintage form with premier pacer Jasprit Bumrah , currently out injured, and India's T20 captain Suryakumar Yadav watching from the stands along with several other former cricketing stars of India and Pakistan, India's ageing warrior, bring out is vintage form, cracked a regal century (100 not out, 111b, 7x4), adding 114 in 128 balls for the third wicket with the in-form Shreyas Iyer (56, 67b, 5x4, 1x6) to help India coast to a comfortable six-wicket win over Pakistan in a Group A match of the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy on Sunday night at the Dubai International Stadium.Going past the landmark of 14,000 ODI runs - by reaching there in just his 287th innings, he broke Tendulkar's record (350 innings) during his umpteenth memorable knock with a trademark cover drive off Haris Rauf, the 36-year-old reached his half-century, off 62 balls, with a four to deep cover for four off Shaheen Shah Afridi.Riding on Kohli's magic, India, the 2023 World Cup finalists, have now virtually entered the semifinals of the Champions Trophy. Meanwhile, much to their embarrassment and their fans' disappointment, the crushing defeat to their arch-rivals has almost sent Pakistan, the defending champions and the tournament hosts, packing after they lost their first two matches to New Zealand and India. If New Zealand beat Bangladesh in Rawalpindi on Monday, India are through to the last four, while Pakistan will be officially out.Apart from their below-par bowling and batting, Pakistan were left to rue their poor fielding too, as they left off Iyer on 25 when Saud Shakeel dropped a chance at mid-wicket off Khushdil Shah. Khushdil himself was guilty of dropping India opener Shubman Gill at mid-wicket in the 11th over off Rauf.Continuing his blazing form, Gill cracked a stroke-filled 46 (52b, 7x4) before he was castled by a 'jaffa' from leggie Abrar Ahmed-the ball turned a fair bit to hit the top of the off-stump- while Indian captain Rohit Sharma again provided India a brisk start with a 15-ball 20-run cameo that included three fours and a six. Rohit lost his middle stump to a superb inswinging yorker unleashed by Shaheen Shah Afridi, conjuring up memories of an lbw dismissal for duck at the hands of a similar 'masterpiece' by Afridi back in the 2021 T20 World Cup.That was the only cheer for Pakistan and Afridi on the night, as the left-arm quick went for 2-74 in eight overs.Earlier, delivering an efficient show, India's bowlers wrapped up Pakistan's innings for 241 in 49.4 overs.Opting to bat first after winning the toss, Pakistan, apart from a phase when middle-order batters Saud Shakeel (62, 76b, 5x4) and skipper Mohammed Rizwan (46, 77b, 3x4) added 104 for the third wicket in 144 balls, kept losing wickets regularly, with Chinaman bowler Kuldeep Yadav (three for 40 in nine overs) and allrounder Hardik Pandya (2-31 in eight overs) being the pick of the lot.Fighting for survival in the tournament, Pakistan's plight would've been worse had it not been for a cameo by Khushdil, who followed up on his 49-ball 69 in the last match against New Zealand with a crucial 38 (39b, 2x6), even as the 2017 Champions Trophy winners, suffering a late collapse, lost their last five wickets for just 41 runs in 42 balls.Openers Imam-ul-Haq and Babar Azam added 41 in 50 balls, before Pandya broke the partnership in the ninth over as Babar Azam (23, 26b, 5x4), who was looking impressive till then, nicked an away going ball behind.Pakistan lost their other opener in the next over itself when Imam ul Haq, included at the last minute after both first-choice openers Saim Ayub and Fakhar Zaman were ruled out injured, was run out for 10 while going for a risky single, as a direct hit by Axar Patel, from mid-on found him short.","India beat Pakistan by seven wickets in Champions Trophy Group A match in Dubai. Virat Kohli scores century to break Sachin Tendulkar's record of 14,000 ODI runs. Shreyas Iyer and Shubman Gill add 114 for the third wicket. Pakistan bowled out for 241 in 49. overs.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118518516,imgsize-43216,width-400,resizemode-4/118518516.jpg"

Alonzo Menifield opens the Main Card at UFC Fight Night 252 against Julius Walker



Alonzo Menifield Octagon Interview | UFC Seattle

's victory against the 6-foot-4 promotional newcomerat UFC Fight Night 252 was an important comeback after being knocked out twice in 2024 by Carlos Ulberg and Azamat Murzakanov. The victory was a split decision win after an enervating 15-minute match, securing both fighters an additional $50,000 for Fight of the Night at Seattle’s Climate Pledge Arena.Menifield, after returning to Texas, decided to rejoin Fortis MMA under head coach Sayif Saud, after having trained previously at Colorado under coach Pat Barry. Menifield admitted that the homecoming accounted for a higher credit considering the familiar environment and the support that he had received all throughout.“Being back in Texas, family all around – gym and my own family – it just felt right to take this on short notice,” Menifield said at his post-fight news conference. “I’m in the right position. I just kept getting signs. God was telling me, and I’m like, This is what I’m supposed to be doing.”Menifield was scheduled to fight Oumar Sy in London next month, but he pulled out and instead stepped in to face Walker on short notice. The match presented unique challenges for Menifield (16-5-1 MMA, 9-5-1 UFC) of Walker’s (6-1 MMA, 0-1 UFC) height and reach. The guidance from his team, including fellow UFC fighter Ryan Spann, helped Menifield stay calm and prevented him from getting too overhyped while facing someone who had three times fewer trips to the big cage. The strategy to pace himself down and fight at 80 mph instead of going all out at 100 mph proved beneficial. Spann’s assistance was particularly useful while dealing with Walker’s clinch game, as Menifield recalled thinking, ""Ryan’s a lot heavier"" which helped him manage the grappling exchanges.Also Read: UFC Fans Furious as Nikolay Veretennikov Attacks Austin Vanderford After Loss The match ended with a nasty toe injury for Menifield, which shall require attention.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

NEW DELHI: India and Pakistan are set to clash in a high-stakes ICC Champions Trophy encounter on Sunday, with both teams chasing different objectives. India, buoyed by their six-wicket win over Bangladesh, look to secure a semifinal berth, while Pakistan, reeling from a 60-run defeat to New Zealand, must win to remain in contention for the last-four spots.The two arch-rivals last met in a Champions Trophy match in 2017, when Pakistan triumphed in the summit clash. The tournament is making a comeback after eight years since the 2017 edition.Although diplomatic tensions have eased, muting the usual fervor, anticipation remains high for this Group A showdown at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium.India hold a clear advantage, having acclimatised to the conditions, while Pakistan arrive in Dubai straight after their loss to New Zealand in Karachi. With form and familiarity on their side, India head into Sunday’s clash with a psychological edge.The Champions Trophy clash between India and Pakistan at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium on February 23 is expected to proceed without any rain interruption, despite rainfall occurring in Dubai days before India's tournament opener.The forecast indicates partly cloudy conditions during afternoon hours, with temperatures ranging between 22 degrees Celsius at its lowest and reaching up to 32 degrees Celsius at its peak.31 DegreesMostly sunny and warm20 km/h5%32 DegreesMostly sunny and warm30 km/h23%26 DegreesPartly cloudy and warm24 km/h100%The playing surface at the Dubai International Stadium provides opportunities for both batting and bowling, with conditions that can fluctuate. During day/night contests, as the surface becomes drier, spin bowlers often find increased effectiveness. The initial phase favours pace bowling, with the potential for movement in the air and bounce off the surface. Whilst scoring opportunities exist, as evidenced by typical first innings totals, the venue does not consistently yield substantial scores.Spin bowling proves particularly crucial during the middle phase, as the surface tends to assist turn. Pace bowlers find value with the new ball, extracting movement and lift. In day/night fixtures, the presence of dew can be influential in the toss decision.Rohit Sharma (c), Shubman Gill (vc), Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul (wk), Hardik Pandya, Axar Patel, Washington Sundar, Kuldeep Yadav, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Shami, Arshdeep Singh, Harshit Rana, Rishabh Pant (wk), Ravindra Jadeja, Varun Chakaravarthy.Mohammad Rizwan (c, wk), Salman Ali Agha (vc), Babar Azam, Fakhar Zaman, Kamran Ghulam, Saud Shakeel, Tayyab Tahir, Faheem Ashraf, Khushdil Shah, Usman Khan, Abrar Ahmed, Haris Rauf, Mohammad Hasnain, Naseem Shah, Shaheen Shah Afridi.","India and Pakistan set to clash in a high-stakes ICC Champions Trophy encounter on Sunday.
