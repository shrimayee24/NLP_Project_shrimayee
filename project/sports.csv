'I won't forgive MS Dhoni': Yuvraj Singh's father Yograj criticizes former India captain,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/i-wont-forgive-ms-dhoni-yuvraj-singhs-father-yograj-criticizes-former-india-captain/articleshow/112979881.cms,"Top Picks For You After a tirade against MS Dhoni, Yuvraj Singh's father Yograj Singh criticizes Kapil Dev

NEW DELHI: Former Indian cricketer Yograj Singh , father of Yuvraj Singh , has once again criticized MS Dhoni , accusing him of negatively impacting his son's cricket career. Yograj's comments highlight a longstanding grievance which he believes curtailed Yuvraj’s career, despite his monumental contributions to Indian cricket, particularly in the 2007 T20 World Cup and the 2011 ODI World Cup victories under Dhoni’s captaincy.Yuvraj Singh's cricket career spanned 17 years, marked by significant achievements including key roles in India's 2007 T20 World Cup and 2011 ODI World Cup triumphs. However, following 2014, his appearances for the national team diminished, with his last international match being in 2017 against the West Indies. Yograj Singh attributes this decline to Dhoni’s influence on the team’s selection decisions.In a recent interview on the Zee Switch YouTube channel, Yograj Singh expressed his strong feelings towards Dhoni, stating: ""I won't forgive MS Dhoni. He should look at his face in the mirror. He is a very big cricketer, but what he has done against my son, everything is coming out now; it can never be forgiven in life. I have never done two things in life - first, I have never forgiven anybody who has done wrong for me, and second, I have never hugged them in my life, be it my family members or my kids. That man (MS Dhoni) has destroyed the life of my son, who could have played four to five years more.""Yuvraj Singh is widely regarded as one of the most illustrious cricketers in Indian history, having amassed close to 12,000 runs and scored 17 centuries in 402 matches across formats. His all-round performance in the 2011 World Cup was particularly celebrated. Yuvraj scored 362 runs at an average of 90.50 and took 15 wickets, which earned him the Player of the Tournament award.Yograj Singh praised his son's resilience, notably during his battle with cancer, which Yuvraj fought while playing in the 2011 World Cup. He also called for Yuvraj to be awarded theBharat Ratna , India’s highest civilian honor, for his contributions to the national team.""I dare everyone to give birth to a son like Yuvraj. Even Gautam Gambhir and Virender Sehwag have said in the past that there won't be another Yuvraj Singh. India should award him the Bharat Ratna for playing with cancer and winning the World Cup for the country,"" Yograj added.Yograj Singh's comments have reignited discussions regarding Yuvraj Singh's career trajectory and the dynamics within the Indian cricket team during the latter stages of his career.","Yuvraj Singh's father Yograj has once again criticized MS Dhoni.

However, her career has faced multiple setbacks due to injuries in recent years. Discussing her situation on the 'House of Glory' podcast with shooting legend Gagan Narang, Nehwal did not shy away from admitting that her professional life is nearing its conclusion.""The knee is not very good. I have arthritis. My cartilage has gone to a bad state. It is very difficult to push for eight-nine hours,"" Nehwal revealed. ""How will you challenge the best players in the world in such a state? I think I will have to accept it somewhere. Because two hours of training is not good enough to play with the highest level of players and get the desired results.""Nehwal has been absent from competitive play since the Singapore Open more than a year ago. As she battles her condition, she has begun to entertain the idea of retirement, although it weighs heavily on her mind.""I am also thinking about it (retirement).

Priest May Face Gunther But There Are Potential Challenges Ahead

Gunther vs. Randy Orton – World Heavyweight Title Match: WWE Bash in Berlin 2024 highlights

Professional wrestling is all about unforgettable moments like epic fights, heart-pounding matches, and jaw-dropping displays of skill. But let’s be real, what really captures the fans’ attention are the fierce feuds that add a whole new level of drama. These rivalries aren’t just about who can wrestle the best; they’re about the personal stakes and storylines that keep everyone on the edge of their seats.One recent example of wrestling excitement was The Bash in Berlin, an event that left audiences in awe with its electrifying performances.The event showcased top-tier wrestling talent, with wrestlers delivering memorable matches that highlighted their impressive abilities.Among the standout stars was Gunther, who has made a significant impact.

This next showdown promises to be another thrilling chapter in his career, adding to the already intense and captivating world of professional wrestling. It is the upcoming Bad Blood and the performer Gunther could face a potential challenge in the form of Damien Priest. Let’s shine some light on it.WWE fans are already well aware of Gunther’s victory against Randy Orton at Bash in Berlin where he claimed the WWE World Heavyweight Championship by defeating Orton. As the promotion shifts its attention towards October’s Bad Blood event, he might likely lock horns with a potential competitor with a string of accolades under his belt. It is none other than Damian Priest .Priest has achieved considerable success in WWE that includes putting up remarkable fights, winning numerous Championships, and engaging in high-profile matches. Above everything, he was the holder of the World Heavyweight Championship prior to getting dethroned by Gunther. Priest and Gunther’s possible pairing stems from the duo’s phenomenal performances and victories in The Bash at Berlin where Priest won in a mixed tag team match alongside Rhea Ripley.Both Ripley and Priest dealt a severe defeat to Liv Morgan and Dominik Mysterio, respectively. While fans are looking forward to their showdown at Bad Blood, things might not run smoothly for Priest who might face an interruption from his Judgment Day rival, Finn Balor. This might set the stage for a rivalry between Balor and Priest instead of a Priest-Gunther showdown and also complicate Priest’s victory.Aside from Priest, two other superstars have shown interest in challenging Gunther for the World Heavyweight Championship. These include CM Punk who won a Strap Match against Drew McIntyre, and Baron Corbin who finds in Gunther a potential rival.

Virat Kohli: 'If you don't score 10000 Test runs...': Harbhajan Singh recalls how he motivated a 'self doubting' young Virat Kohli,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/if-you-dont-score-10000-test-runs-harbhajan-singh-recalls-how-he-motivated-a-self-doubting-young-virat-kohli/articleshow/113008916.cms,"NEW DELHI: Harbhajan Singh recently reflected on the early career of Virat Kohli , offering insights into the determination that has driven Kohli to become one of the greatest in Indian cricket . With anecdotes from Kohli’s debut series in 2008 and his early Test struggles in 2011, Harbhajan discussed Kohli’s relentless desire to excel and the subsequent transformation that turned him into a cricketing legend.Harbhajan remembered a memorable incident during an ODI against Sri Lanka in Kohli's debut series in 2008.Kohli scored a half-century opening the innings but felt unsatisfied.""I remember this one incident. Viru [Virender Sehwag] had gotten injured, I suppose. [Ajantha] Mendis was getting everyone out. He comes in; young guy, free energy. He batted and scored a fifty. He asked me, 'Paaji, how did I play?' I said, 'Very well.' He then said, 'Paaji, I shouldn't have gotten out; should have smacked him more.' Loved the attitude,"" Harbhajan recalled while speaking on Taruwar Kohli's podcast.This hunger for more, even at an early stage, hinted at Kohli's future. Harbhajan also highlighted Kohli's difficulties during his debut Test series in 2011 against the West Indies, where Kohli struggled with self-doubt.""If I tell you something about his Test cricket , at the very beginning. We were in the West Indies. On that tour, Fidel Edwards (former West Indies quick) had troubled him a lot, getting him out either LBW or against the short ball. He was getting out time and again, so obviously he was very disappointed. He had self-doubt, questioned 'If I am good enough?' I told him 'You will shame yourself if you don't score 10,000 runs. You have the capability of scoring 10,000 runs in Test cricket. And if you don't, it'll be because of your own fault.' After that, what Kohli has done is a once-in-a-lifetime exception,” Harbhajan shared.These words proved prophetic as Kohli transformed into one of cricket's giants over the next 13 years. During this period, he elevated his batting to unprecedented levels, broke numerous records, and became the face of Indian cricket.""I have seen him change. His diet, his mindset – 'That I don't want to be just an ordinary player. I want to be someone who people will know for a long time.' The stubbornness I saw in myself, Kohli has a lot more of it. I want to be that guy winning games and scoring hundreds for India. He was scoring hundreds back-to-back in Australia. It was the first time India chasing 400 runs… and they are going after it. We may lose but we'll fight. That attitude of keep going, that's what makes you a player. Kohli has left an everlasting impact on Indian cricket,"" Harbhajan added.Currently, Kohli stands at 8,848 Test runs from 113 matches. His journey from a young batsman to a cricketing legend serves as a source of inspiration. With a long cricketing season ahead, Kohli is expected to surpass the milestone of 10,000 Test runs, further solidifying his legacy as one of India's all-time greats.","Harbhajan Singh reflects on early career of Virat Kohli.

His partner Shadman Islam was on 9 not out when stumps were drawn.The home teams insipid show left former Pakistan batsman Ahmed Shahzad livid.""Bangladeshi bowlers ne Pakistan ke ballebazon ko fir se tigni ka naach nachaya hai (Bangladesh bowlers have stunned Pakistan batsmen once again),"" Shahzad could be heard saying on a video he posted on X (formerly Twitter). ""We are seeing T20 shot selection. The bat is so far away from the body on the shots they are getting out on. Coaches question you on such shots even in T20 and T10 cricket.""Allrounder Agha Salman was Pakistan's top-scorer in the second innings, with a knock of 47, while the top-scorer in the match for Pakistan was opener Saim Ayub, who made 58 in the first innings.""Aap apni galtiyon se seekh hi nahi rahe hain (you are not learning from your mistakes). You don't have that charm anymore. Hum log galti kar rahe hain aapse ummeedein laga ke (we are making a mistake by attaching hopes to you) or the fans are doing that mistake because you are playing with their emotions in such a way,"" Shahzad continued.""Bangladesh have come and created history by beating you in the first Test and now dominating in the second. It is not a fluke. When you lose to Afghanistan, Zimbabwe, Ireland, these things are not fluke. It is the reality of Pakistan, you have brought it to this stage.""Shahzad went on to add that the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) should be held equally responsible for this nosedive in the performance of the team and needs to stop its distracting tactics.""I don't hold only the players responsible. The PCB is as much responsible for this (downfall) because some things were right before us. Some decisions we had to take, but we did the same old thing of saying things on TV and tried to distract the people,"" the former batsman said.""Uske baad hum soch rahe the ke Bangladesh team aayegi, unko toh hum hara hi lenge (Then we were thinking we will be able to beat Bangladesh easily). And when we beat them, then the anger among people will cool down. So we will start the Pakistan Cup in the meantime.""""All this play of yours has backfired in your face.""","Bangladesh reach 43 for no loss at stumps on day four of second Test in Rawalpindi.

The world number five comfortably defeated 34th-ranked Borges, whose challenge crumbled under the pressure of committing 51 unforced errors, while Medvedev broke serve eight times throughout the match.""I played Tommy twice this season. I beat him once but I feel as if he should have beaten me both times,"" said Medvedev who was also runner-up in 2019 and last year.""I've had unbelievable battles with Jannik. It will be very physical for both of us,"" he said on his potential quarterfinal opponent.Sinner, the 23-year-old Italian, is set to face Paul of the United States in the fourth round of the US Open. Sinner aims to become the only male player this year to reach the quarter-finals at all four Grand Slam tournaments.In the 2022 US Open, Sinner made it to the last-eight but suffered a heartbreaking loss to the eventual champion, Alcaraz, despite having a match point.Paul, seeded 14th, is determined to join his fellow Americans, Frances Tiafoe and Taylor Fritz, in the quarterfinals. The United States has been eagerly awaiting a male Grand Slam champion since Andy Roddick's triumph in New York back in 2003.If Sinner advances, he will face Medvedev for the fourth time this season. Sinner has had the upper hand in their previous encounters, staging a remarkable comeback from two sets down to defeat Medvedev in the Australian Open final and emerging victorious in their Miami semifinal clash. However, Medvedev managed to turn the tables at Wimbledon, prevailing in a grueling five-set quarterfinal.In another notable development, Jack Draper became the first British man since Andy Murray in 2016 to reach the US Open quarter-finals.The 22-year-old left-hander showcased his dominance on serve, dropping only one service game out of 48 and saving an impressive 20 out of 21 break points faced throughout his four matches en route to his first Grand Slam quarter-final.Draper acknowledged the significant influence of Murray, the former world number one and 2012 US Open champion, who recently retired from tennis following the Paris Olympics.""He's a legend and an icon and if I have half the career that he had I will be a happy man,"" said the 25th seed who goes on to face Alex de Minaur.De Minaur, seeded 10th, emerged victorious in an all-Australian showdown against Jordan Thompson. The final score was 6-0, 3-6, 6-3, 7-5, with De Minaur showcasing his skills on the court.Swiatek, who has previously won the French Open four times and was the champion in New York in 2022, marked her 100th Grand Slam match with a dominant performance. She defeated 16th-ranked Samsonova in straight sets, 6-4, 6-1, to secure her place in the next round.The Polish star will now face Jessica Pegula , the American sixth seed, in a battle for a spot in the semifinals. Swiatek will be looking to continue her impressive form and move one step closer to another Grand Slam title.""There will be some long rallies and intense hitting,"" said Swiatek of facing Pegula who she also beat in the quarter-finals on her way to the 2022 title.American Pegula, seeded sixth, advanced to the quarterfinals for the second time by defeating Russia's Diana Shnaider 6-4, 6-2.In a historic achievement, Beatriz Haddad Maia became the first Brazilian woman since Maria Bueno in 1968 to reach the quarterfinals. The 22nd-ranked left-hander secured her victory over former world number one Caroline Wozniacki, the 2014 runner-up, with a score of 6-2, 3-6, 6-3 on her third match point.Haddad Maia's next opponent will be Karolina Muchova, who reached the semifinals in 2023. Muchova, ranked 52nd, eliminated fifth seed Jasmine Paolini, the French Open and Wimbledon runner-up, in straight sets, 6-3, 6-3.Remarkably, Muchova has not dropped a set in the tournament, despite only returning to the tour in June after a 10-month absence due to a wrist injury. She also defeated two-time champion Naomi Osaka in the second round.",Daniil Medvedev beats Nuno Borges to reach US Open quarter-finals.

After managing just 31 runs off 77 balls in the first innings, Babar was dismissed for a mere 11 runs off 18 balls in the second innings.This further added to Pakistan's struggles against a determined Bangladesh attack on a challenging fourth-day pitch.Pakistan, who posted 274 in their first innings, seemed to be in a commanding position after reducing Bangladesh to a precarious 26/6. However, a remarkable 165-run partnership between Litton Das and Mehidy Hasan Miraz revived Bangladesh's innings, allowing them to post a total of 262, just 12 runs shy of Pakistan's score.Babar's recent performances have raised concerns among fans and critics alike, with the star batter now enduring 16 consecutive Test innings without a half-century. His form slump has been a topic of much discussion, especially after Pakistan's 10-wicket defeat in the first Test, where Babar was dismissed for a duck and scored just 22 in the second innings.With his last Test fifty dating back to late 2022, Babar's prolonged lean patch has seen his Test average dip below 45, a rare occurrence for the talented batter. Fans have taken to social media to express their frustration, with many showing frustration against Babar for his inability to anchor the innings in crucial situations.Despite the criticism, Pakistan all-rounder Salman Ali Agha has earlier defended Babar, expressing confidence in his ability to bounce back. ""Babar is a world-class player. Every cricketer goes through rough patches, and I am sure he will find his form soon,"" Salman said, highlighting the team's faith in their captain.As Pakistan look to regroup and prepare for upcoming challenges, Babar Azam's form remains a key focus.",Babar Azam fails to make an impact in second Test against Bangladesh.

Mike Zimmer hasn't been on an NFL sideline since 2021, which brought a tough close to his eight-year run as the Vikings ' head coach. He returned to Dallas as defensive coordinator , a position he worked for six straight years from 2000-2006 and contributed to their staff for six seasons prior. This move not only aligns with his expertise but also offers a chance to reshape any negative perception from his tenure in Minnesota.""Part of the reason for coming back is I have to do this for me because I don't want people thinking I was a lousy coach,"" Zimmer shared in a recent interview with Mark Craig of the Minnesota Star Tribune.""Somebody told me, 'You don't have anything to prove after Minnesota,' but I felt like I did.""Zimmer's Numbers Speak for Themselves: Key Stats from his Tenure:He compiled a 72-56-1 record with a solid .562 winning percentage during his time with the Vikings. Under his leadership, the team claimed the NFC North title twice and consistently ranked in the top 11 for defensive scoring in his first six seasons. Zimmer also guided Minnesota to the playoffs three times, including a deep run to the NFC Championship which remains the franchise's highest achievement since 1977.However, his tenure came to an end for a reason, the once-stellar defense fell to the bottom third of the league during his final two seasons, and both the defense and his authoritative approach resulted in losing records. He chose not to address the team after his dismissal, stating that they were the reason he was fired, and he hasn't watched a Minnesota game since.If he re-establishes his interest in the Vikings this year, it will likely signal good news for his Cowboys and his former team. The only way the two teams can meet during the 2024 season, necessitating Zimmer to take a deep dive back into watching the purple and gold, is if both squads reach the playoffs. The stage is set for Zimmer to demonstrate that his coaching acumen is as sharp as ever.Even if Zimmer finds great success leading the defense for America's Team, at 68, he has no expectations that this redemption will open the door to another head coaching opportunity elsewhere.""Guys with worse records than me have gotten second chances, but I don't see it happening because of my age,"" Zimmer said.

He is a world-class player. He is very close. I feel it. I am confident that we are going to see Babar scoring some big runs very soon. He probably hasn't converted the start he has got,"" Gillespie said after the end of Day 4, as quoted by ANI.Post-World Cup, Pakistan's cricket team faced a challenging tour in Australia, resulting in a series whitewash that brought to light the vulnerabilities of Pakistan's batting lineup, with Babar among those facing criticism.Despite accumulating 126 runs at an average of 21 across three Tests in Australia, Babar's performance woes extended into a subsequent tour of England for a T20I series and the T20 World Cup.In the current series against Bangladesh, Babar has compiled a total of 64 runs over four innings, intensifying the spotlight on his form.

This dominance comes despite a spirited first-innings performance from Pakistan's bowlers, who seemed unable to replicate their earlier success against a confident Bangladeshi opening pair.Head Coach Jason Gillespie , speaking at the end of Day 4, shed light on the selection puzzle, emphasizing that the decision was based on a thorough analysis of the pitch conditions and their anticipated evolution throughout the Test match.""So we looked at conditions and what we thought was the best combination. Taking into account what we saw before the game, reflected on the previous game, and this is where we landed. In the first innings, if you at one point saw, we had Bangladesh in a bit of straw. We bowled quite well, and the line and length were excellent,"" Gillespie explained.He further underlined the team's impressive bowling performance in the first innings, where they had Bangladesh under pressure for a significant period. ""There are a few things that we are hoping Shaheen can work on. He had a pretty eventful time in his personal life as well. We want Shaheen Afridi to be at his very best for as much cricket as possible. He is an all-format player, and we have a pretty heavy schedule, and we want him to be fit and firing,"" Gillespie pointed out.Addressing the absence of Shaheen Afridi, Gillespie stressed the team's commitment to developing a robust squad mentality rather than relying heavily on individual brilliance. He emphasized the importance of making informed decisions based on the specific challenges posed by each match and the upcoming schedule.""We are trying to build a squad mentality and not just rely on a few players.

Michael Vaughan says Ollie Pope is 'insecure' as England captain,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/michael-vaughan-says-ollie-pope-is-insecure-as-england-captain/articleshow/112998519.cms,"NEW DELHI: Former England captain Michael Vaughan has expressed his willingness to be proven wrong about Ollie Pope 's leadership capabilities, though he maintained his opinion that Pope is insecure as a leader.Despite rotating bowlers efficiently and setting up creative field placements, Pope's eight unsuccessful reviews and poor batting scores have sparked debate over his suitability as the England Test captain.Pope managed scores of one and 17 in England's 190-run victory over Sri Lanka at Lord's. Over the series, he has accumulated only 30 runs in four innings.Critics have noted his fidgety manner while batting and expressed concerns over his leadership skills.“Ollie Pope is the ideal vice-captain for England. Pope is that perfect foil for Ben Stokes . He is a very good guy, trains well and is a real team man – someone who can give tactical advice when required and is happy in the background. But he is better kept in that role, as vice-captain, than elevated to captain.”“I would be happy to be proven wrong on Pope. But I think he is someone who is a bit insecure. I can see why they gave him the vice-captaincy to give him a boost, but he really did not need the captaincy at this stage of his career. For all the focus on Pope’s captaincy, it will be forgotten when Stokes returns in Pakistan,” wrote Vaughan in his column for The Telegraph.Vaughan also pointed out on Pope's agitation when batting at number three for England.“Not every vice-captain is going to make a captain. There are also a lot of captains who cannot be vice-captains, myself included. I wanted to be the leader. I wanted to be making the decision. I did not want to be the thoughtful strategist in the background.”“I hope that Pope fights through his poor run of form. I hope he can find a way of getting that rhythm. In a game’s time, he is not going to be a captain, and it is purely about his batting. Can he find that rhythm and that calmness at the crease?”“By giving Pope the captaincy now, I think England have given him a pressure that he did not need. It came at a stage when it was looking like he was working out how to bat at No 3 and had done well there against West Indies earlier in the summer. Then he gets thrown the captaincy.”Vaughan also wishes to see Harry Brook being groomed as England’s next Test captain, and feels if needed, Joe Root can take up leadership mantle in an interim capacity. “Looking ahead, Harry Brook would be a better fit as captain for this side: his whole approach makes him a natural successor to Stokes.”“But if there is another interim period when Stokes is injured and there are concerns about whether Brook is ready, what is wrong with giving the captaincy to Joe Root? It would not be backward step. He would just be seeing out a series when you know Stokes is coming back. And Stokes is still there in the dressing room anyway.”","Former England captain Michael Vaughan has expressed his willingness to be proven wrong about Ollie Pope's leadership capabilities.

'I have been told...': Mayank Yadav on why he wasn't chosen for the Duleep Trophy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/i-have-been-told-mayank-yadav-on-why-he-wasnt-chosen-for-the-duleep-trophy/articleshow/112983332.cms,"NEW DELHI: Mayank Yadav 's blistering 150kmph deliveries , coupled with his accuracy, left batsmen perplexed during IPL 2024 while playing for Lucknow Super Giants . particularly with the Cameron Green setup and dismissal still vivid in memory, his performances generated a buzz among cricket fans.Since Lucknow's match against Mumbai Indians on April 30, Mayank, a Delhi domestic cricketer, has been absent from competitive cricket due to a recurring lower abdominal strain.The injury first surfaced early in IPL 2024 and resurfaced after the Mumbai game.Mayank has been undergoing intensive rehabilitation and training at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) in Bengaluru. However, his future remains uncertain after being overlooked for the Duleep Trophy and opting out of the inaugural Delhi Premier League (DPL).According to Sonnet Club coach Devendra Sharma , who mentored Mayank, the pacer has a comprehensive training plan at the NCA. Rajinikanth Sivagnanam, a strength and conditioning coach who has worked with several injured cricketers, is closely monitoring Mayank's progress.“Like in the morning, he is made to bowl, followed by rehab session and exercise routine. After this, he again does his bowling in the nets. All of this is something which he is doing there on a daily basis, as per what he told me.”“He bowls eight-ten overs daily, and I did ask him why he wasn’t named in Duleep Trophy squads. To this, Mayank replied, ‘Sir, I have been told not to go into it as I can’t put too much load on my body and concentrate on white-ball cricket for now’,” said Devendra to IANS.T.A. Sekar , a former Indian fast bowler and current fast-bowling coach, believes that Mayank's technique increases his susceptibility to injuries. ""His technique needs to be adjusted to reduce the likelihood of injuries, as anyone who bowls at 156 kmph, as shown by the IPL speed gun, is naturally more prone to injuries."" as quoted by IANS.“He is young and has terrific potential, but has not played much of cricket. So, straightaway, you cannot put him in a Test match where if he bowls 20 overs, he will get injured again. That’s why, he has to play some cricket, and the last he played was sometime in April-end.”“So, May, June, July, August, and September has come, which tells it will be five months of him not playing any cricket. It is not that only in this IPL he got injured – previously also, he got injured, and that’s why he’s played just one Ranji Trophy match (in December 2022),” said Sekar to IANS.Recently, images surfaced of Mayank bowling to Yashasvi Jaiswal during match-playing scenario sessions in Bengaluru for players bound for the Duleep Trophy. This provided hope that the fast-bowler would soon return to action.“The good news is, he’s bowling right now and can be considered for future teams, as he’s sending down a lot of deliveries at the NCA. He’s told me, ‘Sir I am becoming fit and pain-free, as well as bowling eight to ten overs daily.’ I am sure that in coming time, he will take the field again,” adds Devendra.Currently, the primary focus for everyone, including Mayank, should be on achieving full fitness. Sekar, who observed Mayank in an U-23 match in Pondicherry in 2021 and later at the Mumbai Indians trials in 2022, believes that if the pacer returns to action for the first phase of the Ranji Trophy in October, he has a slim chance of being selected for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. However, Sekar also acknowledges that the pacer must deliver consistent performances in red-ball matches to be considered.“I hope NCA makes sure he is strengthened in the areas where he is getting injured, and remodel his action. Hopefully, he should be coming back and bowling at the same speed, and in the same way bowled in IPL and other matches, because if he is not picked for the Duleep Trophy and if he doesn’t play the Ranji Trophy, how people could pick him for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy?”“Maybe if he plays one or two Ranji Trophy matches in October and bowls exceptionally well, then it might tempt the selectors to pick him at least as an additional/backup fast bowler or as the 17th player for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. Then, if he goes in the practice without injury, then they might pick him for some Test match if the wicket is conducive for fast bowlers.""“He has terrific potential, but India needs to groom him. Definitely, he is a terrific bowler with the white-ball. But for red-ball, we have to wait and see, because nobody has seen him playing red ball cricket consistently,” he concluded.",Mayank Yadav has been absent from competitive cricket due to a recurring lower abdominal strain.

His 138-run knock, lasting 333 minutes, included a pivotal 165-run seventh-wicket partnership with Mehidy Hasan Miraz , who added 78 runs. This impressive comeback has kept the match competitive.Bangladesh were in dire straits at 26/6, tying their lowest total at the loss of the sixth wicket, a record they shared with a match in Durban against South Africa in 2022.Unlike that occasion, where they were bowled out for 53, Bangladesh managed to recover this time, achieving the highest ever total by a team after being six down for 50 or fewer. The previous record was Pakistan's 255 after being 41/6 against England at The Oval in 1967.Litton Das came to bat with Bangladesh in deep trouble at 26/5 and went on to score his fourth Test century. This hundred was made under significant pressure as he had previously scored hundreds after similar collapses, against Pakistan in Chattogram in 2021 (when he came in at 49/4) and against Sri Lanka in Mirpur in 2022 (when he came in at 24/5). Litton Das is now uniquely the first player to score three Test hundreds after entering at No. 6 or lower with his team's score 50 or fewer.Mehidy Hasan Miraz contributed significantly with a score of 78 runs, which is now the highest score by a batter coming in at No. 8 with the team's total below 30. The previous record was held by Moin Khan, who scored 70 against India in Kolkata in the 1998-99 series when Pakistan was also at 26/6. Mehidy's innings was vital in stabilizing the team's score alongside Litton Das.The 165-run stand between Litton and Mehidy is historic. It is the first instance of a seventh-wicket or lower partnership putting on more than 150 runs for a team that had not yet reached 50 runs. The previous best was Jonny Bairstow and Jamie Overton's 241-run partnership for England after being 55/6 against New Zealand in Leeds in 2022.In this series, Bangladesh achieved two 150-plus partnerships for the seventh or lower wicket. The first Test saw Mushfiqur Rahim and Mehidy Hasan Miraz add 196 runs for the seventh wicket. The only other time two such partnerships occurred in a single series was during New Zealand's tour of South Africa in 2006.Litton Das and Mehidy Hasan Miraz's resolve ensured Bangladesh remained in contention, turning a potentially one-sided match into a competitive contest. This crucial partnership not only helped Bangladesh post a respectable total but also showcased the fighting spirit and resilience of their lower-order batsmen.","Bangladesh recover from 26/6 to 262 all out against Pakistan in second Test.

'2-3 cheezen...': Ravichandran Ashwin tells how Rohit Sharma's captaincy differs from that of MS Dhoni and Virat Kohli - Watch,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/2-3-cheezen-ravichandran-ashwin-tells-how-rohit-sharmas-captaincy-differs-from-that-of-ms-dhoni-and-virat-kohli-watch/articleshow/112983223.cms,"NEW DELHI: Rohit Sharma 's captaincy is often compared to that of other successful leaders like MS Dhoni , and many consider him to be one of the best limited-overs captains in contemporary cricket.Rohit is known for his sharp cricketing brain and the ability to make quick decisions under pressure. His field placements and bowling changes often reflect a deep understanding of the game.Rohit is known for his calm and composed nature on the field, which helps in managing the team during high-pressure situations.This quality has been pivotal in Mumbai Indians ' success in closely fought matches.Rohit has a reputation for managing his players well, giving them confidence and backing them during lean phases. This has allowed several young players to thrive under his leadership.And now a video is going viral on the internet in which Indian off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin tells the difference between the captaincy styles of Mahendra Singh Dhoni Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma.Talking to a journalist, Ashwin says, ""2-3 things are nice about Rohit's captaincy. He always keep the environment of the team light. He makes an effort to keep it light. And he stays very balanced and tactically he is strong. Both Dhoni and Virat were also tactically strong but Rohit works more on the tactics. If there is any big match or series coming up, Rohit sits with the analytics team and coach and prepares for it, like what's the weakness of a particular batsman, what's the plan of a bowler. That's his strength but he always keeps the environment of the team light and backs the players. If he selects a player in the XI, he backs them 100%. I have played most of my career with these three captains.""Talking about Team India's new head coach Gautam Gambhir , Ashwin says, ""I have played one or two series with Gauti bhai. Gauti bhai is also very intense. Gauti bhai and Rohit have similarities in their leadership, but Rohit keeps it light and Gauti bhai keeps it intense. It is only a way. Gauti bhai is an intense man, he is very passionate, he is very passionate about Indian cricket, which is exactly how Rahul Dravid is also. Rahul bhai is also passionate about Indian cricket, Gauti is also passionate about Indian cricket, but we feel that both are different, because they have different personalities, every human being is different from the other.""Rohit has also been successful in his limited opportunities as captain of the Indian national team, particularly in the shorter formats. He has led India to victories the T20 World Cup in June earlier this year and also in several other bilateral series and has been considered a natural leader within the squad.Rohit has shown the ability to adapt his captaincy style depending on the situation, whether it's being aggressive or defensive, which has often put his team in a winning position.Under Rohit's captaincy, Mumbai Indians have won the IPL title five times (2013, 2015, 2017, 2019, and 2020), making MI one of the most successful teams in the history of the tournament.",Ravichandran Ashwin says Rohit Sharma's captaincy style is different to that of Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Virat Kohli.

India eye fresh start under coach Manolo Marquez,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/india-eye-fresh-start-under-coach-manolo-marquez/articleshow/113008911.cms,"HYDERABAD: Defending champions India look to start a new chapter under new coach Manolo Maquez when they host Mauritius in the opening fixture of the fourth Intercontinental Cup at the GMC Balayogi Athletics Stadium in Gachibowli on Tuesday.Maquez took the reins from Igor Stimac, who was sacked acrimoniously after India’s disappointing FIFA World Cup qualifier. This is also the first full tournament for India after the retirement of the talismanic striker Sunil Chhetri His departure has left a huge void and a big challenge for the incoming coach.For the 55-year-old Spaniard, life has come full circle. Marquez made his entry into Indian football with Hyderabad FC in ISL in 2020, and now he is set to make his debut with Indian national team in Hyderabad.He had proven his credentials as a coach when he guided the bottom-placed Hyderabad FC in 2020 to the title in the 2021-22 edition. The cur -rent FC Goa coach calls India his ‘second home’ and Hyderabad holds a special place in his heart.Due to paucity of time, India had only two training sessions — one on Sunday and another on Monday — but the coach has no complaints. “I would have liked to have more time with the team, a longer camp. But that is how it is, and we have no excuses. We are ready for the first clash and hope -fully we begin well. I am to be be -ginning from Hyderabad,” said Marquez on the eve of the match.On paper, India — ranked No.124 in the world — begin favourites against Mauritius who are No. 179 in FIFA rankings. However, Marquez is aware that rankings count for nothing and revealed that his bigger goal is to do well in the AFC Asia Cup . “The main target of playing these games in September, October and November is to prepare for the more important thing - the Asian Cup qualifiers, the first game of which is in March,” he revealed.Mauritius are looking to make the most of these two games ahead of the crucial FIFA Qualifying matches next year. “We are still in a preparation phase for official matches. And the important thing for us is to find stability and to start being more efficient. The aim of these games is to look for a team that is very steady,” said Mauritius coach Guillaume Moullec.India, who had defeated Lebanon 2-0 to emerge champions last time in Bhubaneswar, had also won the inaugural edition in 2018 in Mumbai and regained it in 2023.","Defending champions India host Mauritius in the opening fixture of the fourth Intercontinental Cup at the GMC Balayogi Athletics Stadium in Gachibowli on Tuesday.

Quite the opposite: it gave me even more motivation to continue to be honest,"" said Ronaldo, as quoted by Reuters.Ronaldo expressed his eagerness to lead Portugal to another Nations League title, highlighting his focus on short-term objectives rather than long-term plans.""The motivation is to come to the national team to win the Nations League ... We've already won it once and we want to do it again. I might say the same thing over and over again, but I don't think long term, it's always short term,"" he added.Addressing criticism regarding his performance at the 2024 European Championship, Ronaldo remained unfazed. He viewed criticism as a catalyst for progress and emphasized his commitment to professionalism, extending beyond goals and assists to encompass discipline and setting a positive example for his teammates.""Until the end of my career, I will always have the mindset that I will be a starter,"" he remarked.The veteran forward drew a parallel between uninformed criticism and commenting on unfamiliar fields, using Formula 1 as an example.""Criticism is great because if it doesn't exist there's no progress. It's always been like this. Is it going to change now? It won't. So I try to follow my path, be as professional as possible, help in the best way possible with my professionalism and not just with goals, assists, discipline, and example, because football is much more than just playing well or scoring a goal. The people who give their opinions have never been in a locker room, and I often laugh because it's the same thing as me talking about Formula 1,"" Ronaldo said.""How can I give my opinion on Formula 1 if I don't know anything about tires, rims or the weight of the car ... It's normal and that's why for me criticism is good and part of it, it's no problem at all,"" the footballing legend concluded.","Cristiano Ronaldo has refuted rumours suggesting his retirement from international football.

This victory moved Real Madrid up to second place in the standings.The Spanish media criticized new signing Mbappe for failing to score in Madrid's first three La Liga games after he scored against Atalanta in the UEFA Super Cup , as per AFP.After missing a number of opportunities, Mbappe was forced to wait for his goals. In the 67th minute, Fede Valverde's perfectly timed backheel allowed him to whisk the ball past the Betis goalie with his left foot.After scoring a second goal eight minutes later from the penalty spot, the France captain was applauded as he left the field in the 84th minute to be replaced by Luka Modric Mbappe's smile contrasted with the worry he had displayed since August 14, when he scored his first goal and won his first title in Warsaw.Coach Carlo Ancelotti responded to the criticism on Saturday, stating that his star recruit was fitting in nicely.""It's true that he hasn't scored but he's playing very well and has been very dangerous every time. I don't think he has any problems adapting,"" said Ancelotti, pointing instead to his team's lack of balance.After defeating Real Valladolid 7-0 on Saturday, Madrid's 2-0 victory moves them up to second place in the standings with eight points, four points behind champions Barcelona .

We don’t believe it yet,” were Juan Pedro Benali ’s words at the post-match press conference in Kolkata.But just as he followed it up by reiterating as an afterthought, NorthEast United are Durand Cup champions and had a rousing welcome upon their return to Guwahati with the first trophy to add to their cabinet.“We are really hungry, you know.We are a young team. And till today (Saturday), we didn’t win absolutely anything,” he explained of their undying determination in etching a shoot-out win against a fancied Mohun Bagan Super Giant playing at home.Their failure to have qualified for the playoffs of Indian Super League last season seemed to have added to their resolve in ushering in the new season with a bang.“When you underestimate a team like us, you fail. And the players worked very, very hard. They beat themselves and the result came. I think everyone thought it was finished after Mohun Bagan took a 2-0 lead in the first half. But we are the wolves of the Northeast. We always go hunting. We are hungry. Till the last minute,” added Benali.Their consistent performance – both as a team and in individual brilliance – is vindicated by the fact that along with the champions trophy, the Highlanders have brought home the Golden Ball and Golden Glove for Jithin MS and Gurmeet Singh, respectively.It was also a reward for the belief shown in NEUFC by its sole owner, actor John Abraham, who is the only private owner in an ISL environment of large franchise owners.“The feeling of winning Durand Cup has not yet sunk in. This is just a lesson for all to never give up, to hold on to the team and support the team, not just in winning times but even when we are losing,” Abraham, who was at the Salt Lake stadium to savour every moment of the final, said in a video message on the club’s social media handle.“There’s light at the end of the tunnel and we proved it! Congratulations to the entire team and the staff… I am just a representation standing here talking on their behalf. The real heroes are the staff, the coach, players, and everyone involved in making this team.”The club also posted a video of the frenzied celebration at the team hotel shared by one of Saturday’s regulation-time goal-scorers along with Guillermo Fernandez, Alaeddine Ajaraie, as well as another of their jubilant reserve team players, away for the Climate Cup, watching the match in Leh.While the supporters rushed to the airport in volume to welcome the NEUFC heroes, social media was also flooded with posts acknowledging the historic feat of winning the oldest existing football tournament in Asia.Others hoped this was the beginning of brighter things for the northeast club. And the Spaniard at the helm of guiding them suggested it could be the path they take.“We are a club that develops, we are a club that who we are. We have our feet on the ground. This win will not make us crazy.

There are clubs like Sethu FC, Gokulam Kerala, Kickstart and HOPS who are doing a lot for women's football solely for passion and with nothing in return. So, this kind of a win gives them hope and satisfaction,"" Crispin told TOI from Jordan. ""It's also a platform for me as a coach to learn what the Indian players lack and work on that. And for the players, they will get to understand the difference between us and the best women footballers in Asia.""With Etihad starting Saturday's game with a better goal difference, their confidence was met by the grit of Odisha players. However, a misunderstanding between Taqi Ghazi and goalkeeper Sherin Shalabi led to the breakthrough in the 27th minute, with Yeboah guiding the ball into a gaping goalmouth.The tie then saw the two teams reduced to 10 players just before the break, with an off-the-ball altercation between Leen Al-Btoush and Grace Hauhnar resulting in referee Rebecca Durcau sending off both the players.Despite a couple of saves from goalkeeper Shreya Hooda, the hosts equalised in the 57th minute with Jordan's all-time top-scorer Maysa Jbarah curling in a low shot beyond Hooda from a Naima Bouhani long cross.The Indian side, however, took the lead again in the 71st minute, benefiting from another Etihad mistake when Shalabi missed her attempted clearance, allowing Odisha's Ghanaian recruit to slot home her second of the game and take Odisha into the group stage.""We had a gameplan for Etihad but it's the attitude of the players that won the match. We were monsters in the field,"" the Odisha coach said in his assessment of the game.While Crispin agreed that they might ""add a few players here and there"" to their squad, for the time being the coach stressed on the need for some time away from football for the team before they embark on their group-stage AFC campaign in Vietnam from October 6 to 12.","Odisha FC Women beat Etihad Club 2-1 at Prince Mohammed Stadium in Zarqa, Jordan.

Premier League: Liverpool demolish Man United to maintain perfect Arne Slot start,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/epl/top-stories/premier-league-liverpool-demolish-man-united-to-maintain-perfect-arne-slot-start/articleshow/112973541.cms,"NEW DELHI: Arne Slot successfully managed his first major test as Liverpool manager with a resounding 3-0 victory against Manchester United on Sunday, with Luis Diaz scoring twice and Mohamed Salah adding a third.Slot, who replaced Jurgen Klopp, has now maintained a perfect record with three wins in the Premier League , placing Liverpool alongside Manchester City at the top of the table.United, on the other hand, faced their second consecutive defeat, putting United's manager, Erik ten Hag, under early-season pressure. Last season, Ten Hag oversaw United's worst-ever Premier League finish, landing in eighth place.An FA Cup final victory over Manchester City briefly revived his position, accompanied by a substantial £200 million investment in new signings.Despite the financial backing, United's weaknesses from last season were evident against Liverpool. Casemiro, in particular, struggled, being blamed for both of Diaz's goals and subsequently substituted at half-time for the younger Toby Collyer.Manuel Ugarte, a £42 million signing, was introduced to the crowd before the match. The club now hopes the Uruguayan can strengthen their midfield. In contrast, Liverpool made an effective internal adjustment by moving Ryan Gravenberch into a defensive midfield role, a decision by Slot that has already yielded positive results.Klopp's tenure saw Liverpool dominate United yet struggle to secure victories at Old Trafford, managing just two wins out of 11 away games. Notable past matches include last season's narrow FA Cup quarter-final loss and a league draw that hindered Liverpool's title bid.However, on Sunday, Liverpool's performance was clinical, nearly matching their record 5-0 win at Old Trafford in 2021. Liverpool displayed early dominance, though an initial goal by Trent Alexander-Arnold was disallowed due to Mohamed Salah being offside.Casemiro's early season form had shown promise, contrasting with his struggles last season. Nevertheless, his performance on Sunday suggested his peak might be behind him. A poorly executed pass by Casemiro led to Liverpool's first goal, with Gravenberch intercepting and passing to Salah, who set up Diaz.Shortly after, Alisson Becker made a critical save against Noussair Mazraoui. Yet United's defense crumbled after Liverpool's second goal just before half-time. Diaz capitalized on another Casemiro mistake and scored from Salah's cross.Salah extended Liverpool's lead on 56 minutes, scoring his 15th goal in 16 matches against Manchester United. His goal also continued his streak of scoring in each of his last seven appearances at Old Trafford.Salah could have increased his tally but missed a close-range opportunity while his teammates awaited a pass. Alisson further secured Liverpool's clean sheet with a fine save from Joshua Zirkzee's shot.Arsenal has often been viewed as Manchester City's main challenger for the Premier League title after four consecutive wins by Pep Guardiola's team. Yet, Liverpool’s early-season performance under Slot suggests they remain serious contenders, even in the absence of Klopp.","Arne Slot successfully managed his first major test as Liverpool manager with a resounding 3-0 victory against Manchester United on Sunday.

US Open 2024: Defending champion Coco Gauff ousted by Emma Navarro,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/us-open/us-open-2024-defending-champion-coco-gauff-ousted-by-emma-navarro/articleshow/113008676.cms,"BOPANNA-EBDEN DUO CRASHES OUT

Coco Gauff ’s US Open fourth round loss to compatriot Emma Navarro was a statistical nightmare. She had 19 double faults, 60 unforced errors, 29 of which came on the forehand side, but the 20-year-old American, who was fighting demons in her head as much as her opponent, scored with spirit.Gauff, the defending champion, went down 6-3, 4-6, 6-3. The popular star, playing in a cornflower-blue dress, was un -bowed.She had only lost a tennis match.“Mentally and emotionally, I gave it my all,” she said. “Of course there were things execution-wise, I wish I could serve better. If I had done that, it would’ve been a different story for me in the match.”The third seed, whose serve is work in progress, having started the remodelling in the off-season last year, has sent down 277 double faults in her 50 matches this season, the most by any player in the top-100. Gauff vowed to set what appears to be a technical issue —ball toss and body position at point of contact—straight. “I go down on my left side a lot on my serve,” she said, “it is something I’m aware of.”As they say, a problem well stated is half solved.Aryna Sabalenka, who logged 428 double faults in 55 matches in the 2022 season, figured the issue with her serve was biomechanics, a default set -ting being the trigger. The Belarusian hired a biomechanics expert mid-sea -son to restructure her serve.“I want to get other opinions,” Gauff said. “I think it’s sometimes more of an emotional, mental thing because if I go out on the practice court right now, I would make 30 serves in a row. It’s also kind of a mental hurdle that I have to get over.”She added, “I don’t want to lose matches like this anymore.”While Novak Djokovic and Carlos Alcaraz looked at the tight tennis summer schedule with concern, especially the switches in surface from clay to grass and clay again before the American hardcourt swing, Gauff refused to blame the Olympic Games slotted in the middle of a draining summer.“I didn’t feel any exhaustion. I was really excited,” she said of playing the US Open. “I was ready to go on court. Even today I felt ready to go on court. I was excited. (The Olympic Games) is something you have to deal with every four years. Every Olympics I can qualify for and I’m healthy, I’m definitely going to play.”The American is looking at a training block to tweak the problems on her serve. “I don’t know what my schedule will look like at the end of this year,” she said. “I feel like I want to spend a good training block. I haven’t had that since maybe before the clay season started. We’ll see how Asia goes, obviously if I qualify, I’ll play. I think for me in the long-term I definitely want to get a good training block.”Gauff was all praise for her 23-yearold compatriot Navarro, who also eliminated the 20-year-old in the fourth round at Wimbledon in July. Navarro, the 2021 NCAA singles champion playing for the University of Virginia, has reached a career-high ranking of No. 12.

NEW DELHI: Former world number one Andy Murray criticized US Open organizers for their scheduling, labeling it a 'total mess' after a women's match concluded at a record 2:15 a.m.Zheng Qinwen of China prevailed over Donna Vekic in a match that set a new record for the latest finish in women's singles at Flushing Meadows, but Murray insisted this record represented a low point.Zheng, the seventh seed, repeated her Olympic Games gold medal victory over Vekic in a 7-6 (7/2), 4-6, 6-2 triumph. Their fourth-round clash stretched for two hours and 50 minutes, kicking off around 11:25 p.m. on Sunday after a preceding men's match that spanned three hours and four sets.Zheng's match broke the previous late finish record of 2:13 a.m. from 2021, set by Maria Sakkari against Bianca Andreescu in a last-16 matchup. Despite the early morning conclusion, Zheng remained composed.""It's always nice to play in the night session because I'm used to it,"" Zheng told the diehard smattering of fans left inside the cavernous 24,000-seater Arthur Ashe Stadium.""It's the first time I've played here in New York at two in the morning. It's unbelievable. Thanks to the fans that aren't sleeping tonight for supporting me here.""This year's US Open has seen several late finishes, despite ongoing efforts to address the issue, which has also plagued other Grand Slam events in Melbourne and Paris.World number two Aryna Sabalenka's win over Ekaterina Alexandrova in the third round started at a record late time of 12:08 a.m. on Saturday and finished at 1:48 a.m.""I got back at 3:00 a.m., probably fall asleep at 4:00,"" said Sabalenka.""I'm glad I didn't play for, like, three hours and then I would probably come back at 5:00 a.m. and then this would be tricky.""Germany's Alexander Zverev completed a four-set, third round win over Tomas Martin Etcheverry at 2:35 a.m. on Saturday.That was the second latest finish in US Open history, behind only the 2:50 a.m. conclusion between Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner in 2022.World number four Zverev was back on the court on Sunday afternoon to defeat Brandon Nakashima and reach the quarter-finals.US Open chiefs introduced a new policy this year to counter the problem of late finishes with the tournament referee able to move a match to another show court if necessary.""We've had late matches here. We will still have late matches here. We are now defining a policy,"" tournament director Stacey Allaster said on the eve of the US Open.""In the event that we have the second match of the evening in Ashe or the last match in Armstrong, if those matches have not gone on by 11.15pm, the referee will have the discretion to move the match.""However, she added: ""That's going to depend on many variables, like do we have the broadcast team ready, do we have a ball crew and so forth.""Zverev is no stranger to early morning finishes -- in Acapulco in 2022, he completed a first round win over Jenson Brooksby at 4:55 a.m. It is the latest-ever finish in all tennis history.The latest finish in all Grand Slams was 4:34 a.m. when Lleyton Hewitt defeated Marcos Baghdatis at the 2008 Australian Open.In Melbourne this year, Daniil Medvedev completed a five-set win over Emil Ruusuvuori at 3:40 a.m.Twelve months earlier, Murray defeated Thanasi Kokkinakis just after 4 a.m. after five hours and 45 minutes on court.At this year's French Open, Novak Djokovic won a match against Lorenzo Musetti at a tournament record 3:06 a.m.US star Coco Gauff described such finishes as ""unhealthy"" for players and fans.Earlier in 2024, the ATP and WTA, who run the main tours, issued new guidelines to prevent late finishes.The number of evening matches is limited while none are allowed to start after 11 p.m.That strategy does not, however, apply to the Grand Slams although Wimbledon already operates a locally-agreed 11 p.m. curfew.","Andy Murray criticizes US Open organizers for 'total mess' after women's match ends at 2:15 a.m. Zheng Qinwen of China defeats Donna Vekic 7-6 (7/2), 4-6, 6-2 at Flushing Meadows.

""I belong in these rounds of Grand Slams. I can make deep runs.""Navarro, 23, grew up in South Carolina but was born in New York, something she made sure to note in her post-match interview at Arthur Ashe Stadium .Ben, her father, founded Sherman Financial Group and is its billionaire CEO. In 2018, he made an effort to purchase the Carolina Panthers of the NFL. He owns the Charleston WTA Tour tournament.Navarro attended the University of Virginia to play collegiate tennis, where as a freshman in 2021 she helped the team win the NCAA singles championship.""When I first left college, my coach and I kind of made a two-year contract that I would fully commit myself to playing professional tennis for two years and then kind of just reassess after that,"" said Navarro, who will facePaula Badosa of Spain on Tuesday. ""I think I hit the two-year mark this June, and we didn't even acknowledge it or talk about it. So definitely have surpassed my expectations, for sure. I hope to just keep getting better.""From No. 143 at the end of 2022 to No. 38 at the end of the previous year, to her current career-best No. 12, Navarro has been rapidly rising in the rankings. Because the US Open seedings were determined by rankings from prior to last month's draw, she is ranked thirteenth.This season has truly been a breakthrough. At January of 2024, she won her first WTA championship at Hobart, Australia, on a hard court that is also used for the US Open. She is 49-19 overall.""In the past, I've seen choices on court - like taking the ball on the rise or moving forward to hit a forehand as opposed to moving back, stuff like that. Those have been choices in the past. Now I see those types of situations as less of a choice and more of, like: I have to take this on in this way,"" explained Navarro, who rarely shows much emotion during a match. ""Partially because the players I'm playing against, they'll shut it down if I don't make that more confident, aggressive choice. And, also, just because I think I have more belief in myself to be able to actually execute those types of shots.""She has only participated in eight Grand Slam events, and the 2024 US Open is the second in which she has advanced to the quarterfinals by defeating Gauff.Navarro prevailed 6-4, 6-3 in their July Wimbledon fourth-round game as well. Navarro also defeated four-time major champion Naomi Osaka at Wimbledon earlier at the All England Club.Navarro had a 6-5 record in majors prior to that performance, which concluded in a quarterfinal loss to Jasmine Paolini. She had also gone 0-2 at the US Open, where she lost in the first round in 2021 and 2023.""It's pretty insane just to talk about winning a Grand Slam or winning a tournament like the U.S. Open. A few months ago, even I wouldn't have said that,"" Navarro said. ""So it's pretty crazy to be sitting here now and have the quarterfinals ahead of me and feel like I'm playing good enough to keep it going.""With 19 double faults and 60 unforced errors overall, Gauff damaged herself, although she did give respect to Navarro for applying pressure to her serve and showing the same diversity as in their Wimbledon match.""In the future, I have to take care of my serve. She's a great returner. She does a great job with just redirecting,"" Gauff said. ""She's kind of an all-court player. She can do everything.""After competing together for the United States at the Paris Games, the two became friends.Navarro expressed her admiration for Gauff, and after the game, they shared an embrace at the net.""She's super funny. She's kind of the opposite of how she is on court. She has a lot of personality, but she doesn't show it as much to you guys,"" Gauff said. ""She's super nice. I always root for her.

""If I lose today some (hate ) messages are coming in, but I try to be as less as possible on social media because of that. It's like when you live something positive then you see compliments and then when you lose, you see something a bit more negative, but that's how everything works.""""We always try to do our best. Sometimes we win; sometimes we lose,"" he said of an athlete's journey.
