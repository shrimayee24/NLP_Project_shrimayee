In a blockbuster trade proposal, theare reportedly exploring the possibility of acquiring, a move that could significantly strengthen their playoff chances. The proposed deal, which involves the Bucks, Heat, and Detroit Pistons in a three-team trade, is seen as a bold attempt to elevate Milwaukee‚Äôs roster.To make the trade work, the Milwaukee Bucks would need to part ways with a combination of players. Key assets such as Pat Connaughton and Khris Middleton are expected to be included, as their salaries would help match Butler‚Äôs $48.8 million for the season. However, the deal would require more than just these two players, with additional assets necessary to finalize the trade. The proposed breakdown of the trade is as follows:- Bucks receive: Jimmy Butler and Alec Burks- Heat receive: Khris Middleton, Bobby Portis, and a 2031 first-round pick (Top-5 protected)- Pistons receive: Pat Connaughton, MarJon Beauchamp, and a 2031 second-round pickFor the Milwaukee Bucks, acquiring Jimmy Butler could provide a significant boost, especially on the defensive side of the ball. Despite some of his past challenges, Butler‚Äôs resume speaks for itself. He has been the key player on two teams that made unexpected runs to the NBA Finals, proving his ability to perform in high-pressure situations. While Butler wouldn‚Äôt be expected to score as much as he did in the Miami Heat, his leadership and defensive prowess could help raise the Bucks‚Äô ceiling.However, bringing Jimmy Butler into the fold isn‚Äôt without risks. Reports from Yahoo Sports! suggest that some members of the Golden State Warriors' core, including Stephen Curry and Steve Kerr, have expressed concerns about how Butler would fit into the locker room. This is something the Milwaukee Bucks would need to carefully consider before making the move. A successful integration of Butler into the team could propel Milwaukee back to the top of the Eastern Conference, but they must weigh the potential cost of disrupting team chemistry.Also read: NBA Trade News: Golden State Warriors Stephen Curry skeptical about blocbuster trade for $146 million Miami Heat star, head coach Steve Kerr shares similar sentiments This move might be a game-changer for Milwaukee even though the Bucks have played well this season.

Bills Mafia stands behind Griffin



Sports stir up passion, and when a team falls short, emotions can run high. That was certainly the case after the Bills‚Äô gut-wrenching loss to the Chiefs in the AFC Championship. Veteran QB Robert Griffin III added fuel to the fire with his controversial analysis of Josh Allen 's performance, igniting a fierce backlash from Buffalo fans who weren‚Äôt pleased with his critique of their star quarterback.Sports can stir up intense emotions, especially when your team falls short. And that's exactly what happened after the Bills' heartbreaking loss to the Chiefs in the AFC Championship. The aftermath? A fiery reaction from fans, particularly after veteran QB Robert Griffin III pointed fingers at Josh Allen, a move that did not sit well with the Buffalo faithful.Appearing on Kay Adams' ""Up and Adams"" show, Griffin shared his controversial take, stating, ‚ÄúNo one has pointed this out‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve watched the tape back multiple times, Josh Allen could have actually adjusted the protection and picked up that blitz. But no one is talking about that because I think there‚Äôs a fear right now amongst the media to criticize Josh Allen because he‚Äôs been so great. And I do think Josh Allen is a great quarterback.‚ÄùThe Bills were trailing the Chiefs 29-32 with just two minutes left on the clock. In a critical moment, Allen threw a pass to Kincaid, who had gotten behind the defense but couldn't make the catch. That mistake allowed the Chiefs to run down the clock and secure the victory. But Griffin believes the blame lies not with Kincaid, but with Josh Allen himself.Despite a solid performance completing 24 of 34 passes for 237 yards, two touchdowns, and a passer rating of 104.7, Allen‚Äôs mistake was enough to spark outrage. Bills fans, fiercely loyal to their star QB, were outraged by Griffin's comments, viewing them as unfair and overly critical. The backlash was so severe that some fans went as far as sending death threats to the former Ravens QB, turning social media into a battleground of heated debates, intense reactions, and passionate defenses of Allen‚Äôs performance, further fueling the ongoing discourse surrounding the quarterback's playoff struggles.Also Read: Andy Reid's key weapon at Chiefs: 6-time Super Bowl champion who coached both Mahomes and Brady Griffin recently took to X to address the backlash he received after analyzing the Bills‚Äô loss to the Chiefs.

I‚Äôm doing my job and analyzing the game.‚Äù Griffin clarified that his analysis focused on one play, adding, ‚ÄúI love Josh Allen‚Äôs game and don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs his fault they lost the AFC Championship game.‚Äù (Via: EssentiallySports)He also responded to personal attacks, stating,‚ÄúNo amount of death threats, calling me the n-word, or personal attacks will make me shy away from giving the people the insight they deserve.‚Äù Griffin noted that not all fans represent the whole fandom, and many quickly rallied behind him.Support poured in from fans like David Stapleton, who said, ‚ÄúSorry that people are going to this extent through a faceless communication platform. Thank you for taking the time to explain your stance‚Ä¶‚Äù Another fan shared, ‚ÄúI'm so sorry that's happening to anyone. It's 2025 for FS!!!!

The Golden State Warriors clinch a win against the Utah Jazz



The Green family is not just passionate about basketball, but the Golden State Warrior star Draymond Green is also an avid fan of the footy sport. Green attends NFL games pretty regularly, and his wife is often seen tagging along. And it looks like her clique has a couple of WAGs from the NFL sect as well, as Hazel Renee was recently seen interacting with the Philadelphia Eagles defensive end, Brandon Graham‚Äôs wife, Carlyne Graham, on social media.Brandon Graham plays as a defensive end for the Philadelphia Eagles. But after a torn triceps injury, the star player was out of action since the season's Week 12. But a return to the field is becoming a possibility with each passing day. And the latest Instagram post by his wife, Carlyne Graham, has fans (including Hazel Renee) quite excited.After the Eagles won the NFC Championship, the team and their friends and family were seen celebrating the title. The team will be playing the Super Bowl 2025 against the Kansas City Chiefs, and chances are Graham could be making a return on February 10. Carlyne Graham posted a series of pictures of the team celebrating the NFC win, writing: ‚ÄúNOLA here we come!‚ÄùAnd it's not only the Grahams who are excited about this possible return of Brandon Graham.

With a 114-103 score, the Warriors ended the game with a win, even though the Jazz had an early lead. Amid multiple injuries, the Warriors haven't had the best of time on the court off late, so this win is a definite improvement and will be great to boost their morale.Star players Draymond Green as well as Stephen Curry had to sit this one out because of injury-related issues. Green has missed quite a few games, thanks to a left calf strain. And Curry missed the last one against the Utah Jazz because of a bilateral knee injury management. Hopefully, he will be back for the game against the Oklahoma City Thunder, but Green, despite being back to training, will miss a couple more games before he is considered fully fit.Also Read: NBA Trade Rumor: Golden State Warriors in pursuit of $40 million Pacers' star, Jonathan Kuminga on the table as trade asset","Brandon Graham's possible Super Bowl return excites Hazel Renee.

When and where to watch the game between the Dallas Mavericks and the Detroit Pistons (January 31, 2025)?



Thewill be without rookie centerfor their Friday night matchup against the Detroit Pistons . Lively is listed as out with an ankle injury, adding to the team‚Äôs growing list of unavailable players.Lively has been an important piece for the Mavericks this season, providing rim protection, rebounding, and scoring in the paint. The 7-foot-1 big man has averaged solid numbers in his rookie campaign, but injuries have limited his availability. His absence will force Dallas to adjust its frontcourt rotation against Detroit.Dallas (26-22) heads into the game dealing with several key injuries, including star guard Luka Doncic (calf), Dante Exum (wrist), Dwight Powell (hip), and Maxi Kleber (foot). With Dereck Lively II ruled out, the Dallas Mavericks will likely lean on Daniel Gafford and P.J. Washington to anchor the interior.On the other side, the Pistons (23-24) are dealing with an injury to Jaden Ivey, who remains out with a leg issue. Detroit is led by Cade Cunningham, who has been averaging 26.7 points, 9 assists, and 5.1 rebounds over the last 20 games.The Mavericks rank 10th in the NBA in rebounds per game (44.9), but Dereck Lively II‚Äôs presence has been crucial in that area. Without him, Dallas loses a strong shot-blocking presence and a reliable lob target in pick-and-roll situations. His ability to alter shots and provide second-chance opportunities has been a key factor in the team‚Äôs frontcourt success.Against a Pistons team that features Jalen Duren, who averages 10.7 rebounds per game, the Dallas Mavericks will need a collective effort on the glass. The team will also have to rely more on perimeter shooting and the scoring of Kyrie Irving, who has been averaging 16.5 points over the last 20 games.Dereck Lively II‚Äôs status beyond this game remains uncertain, and his recovery will be closely monitored as the Mavericks continue their playoff push. His absence adds to the challenges Dallas faces, but the team has shown resilience throughout the season.Also read: Will the Luka Doncic play tonight against the Detroit Pistons?

The team will also be missing Dereck Lively (ankle), Dante Exum (wrist), Dwight Powell (hip), and Maxi Kleber (foot).Luka Doncic‚Äôs absence is a significant blow for the Dallas Mavericks, who are currently 26-22 and looking to gain momentum in the Western Conference. The four-time All-Star has been the focal point of Dallas‚Äô offense, averaging 33.6 points, 9.2 rebounds, and 9.7 assists per game this season. With him sidelined, the team will have to rely on Kyrie Irving and P.J. Washington to step up against a Pistons squad that has struggled to find consistency.Without Luka Doncic, the Mavericks will have to adjust their offensive strategy. Kyrie Irving will take on a larger playmaking role, while P.J. Washington and Daniel Gafford will be key contributors in the paint. Spencer Dinwiddie and Quentin Grimes are also expected to see an increased workload.Dallas Mavericks is currently ninth in the NBA in scoring, averaging 115.9 points per game, but their efficiency could take a hit without Doncic‚Äôs elite shot creation. They will be facing a Pistons defense that ranks 17th in the league, allowing 113.5 points per game.Detroit (23-24) will also be without a key player, as Jaden Ivey has been ruled out with a leg injury. The Pistons will look to Cade Cunningham, who is averaging 26.7 points and 9 assists over his last 20 games, to lead the charge against a depleted Mavericks squad.The Dallas Mavericks will require a good team effort to win in Detroit since their lineup is beset by injuries.

With this violation, his total exceeded five points, triggering an automatic one-game suspension under the NBA‚Äôs Flagrant Foul point system.The NBA‚Äôs rules dictate that players accumulating five or more Flagrant Foul points in a season face immediate suspensions. The penalties increase with each additional Flagrant Foul:In addition to the suspension, Stewart has been fined $50,000 for making inappropriate and objectionable gestures following his ejection against the Pacers.This is not the first time Stewart has faced disciplinary action from the NBA. He has developed a reputation for on-court altercations, with previous suspensions stemming from incidents involving other players.One of the most notable occurrences was in November 2021, when Stewart was involved in a heated confrontation with Los Angeles Lakers superstar LeBron James. The incident took place after James struck Stewart in the face with an elbow during a free throw attempt. Bloodied and enraged, Stewart attempted to charge at James multiple times, forcing security, teammates, and coaches to intervene. As a result, Stewart was suspended for two games, while James received a one-game suspension.More recently, in February 2024, Stewart was suspended for three games following an altercation with Phoenix Suns center Drew Eubanks.

Mets could offer '$330-$340 million' deal to Pete Alonso if he decides to make homecoming: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/mlb/news/mets-could-offer-330-340-million-deal-to-pete-alonso-if-he-decides-to-make-homecoming-report/articleshow/117779578.cms,"Mets could offer '$330-$340 million' deal to Pete Alonso if he decides to make homecoming (Image Source: Alonso/IG)

MLB insider sheds light on Pete Alonso‚Äôs major struggle getting back to Mets

""We‚Äôve written this before, but the Mets‚Äô stance on Alonso as a player and person has remained consistent: They like him, and have wanted him back all along. Now that they have pivoted, bringing Alonso back at a similar three-year deal with opt outs to the one he rejected would push them into uncomfortable payroll territory, perhaps the $330-$340 million range.""

""Is it possible [the Blue Jays] could sign Alonso and move Guerrero to third? Sure. But my understanding is that they're not in this thing at all. Not that they don't have interest, not that they would consider it if the price is right. But based on kind of the way the Alonso camp is, and where Pete wants to go, it doesn't seem to be an option.""

‚ÄúThat final offer from the Mets that Alonso turned down is going to be hard to beat for the Blue Jays. That was the $70 million that we talked about for three years. Additional deferred money. That could have been a real win in what ultimately the final dollar figure could have looked like.""

‚ÄúGiven what the Blue Jays gave Anthony Santander, which was in the sixties after the deferred money, [Alonso] is probably not going to get as good an offer from Toronto. I am still getting an expectation that if he comes back it is going to take a while. It easily seems like we can get to spring training and this is still a topic. And when Pete re-signs the Mets could already be in camp. There‚Äôs no reason for the Mets to rush,""

Even though New York Mets ' owner Steve Cohen has made it clear from his side that the team has already moved forward from Pete Alonso , they haven't completely given up. As said in his statement, the Mets are always considering Alonso's re-signing if things get streamlined in the future.However, even if Pete Alonso decides to come back to the Mets, his signing would not be easy, and there might be a major toll on his salary expectations. MLB insider Andy Martino felt the same in his recent report on Tuesday, in which he claimed that Alonso's salary bracket would shrink to ""$330 to $340 Million."" Talking about the same, he said:Apart from Andy Martino, MLB insider Jim Bowden shared the same feeling about Pete Alonso's reunion with the New York Mets. During Thursday's appearance on the ""Foul Territory,"" Bowden elaborated on Alonso's contract discussions with the Blue Jays in comparison to the Mets re-signing. Sharing details into his take, the insider stated:Moreover, Andy Martino previously reflected back on Pete Alonso's possible return to the team, during Monday's appearance on SNY. Martino expressed how the team offered Alonso a ""hard to beat"" offer and considering the fact that he already rejected it, there's a least chance for the Blue Jays to match the offer. Detailing into his take, Martino said:Martino further added.Talking about Pete Alonso's contract struggles with the Mets, an MLB analyst recently blamed the first baseman for it and not Steve Cohen.",MLB insider Andy Martino believes that the New York Mets could offer Pete Alonso $330 to $340 million if he decides to come back to the team. MLB insider Jim Bowden believes that Alonso's contract negotiations with the Toronto Blue Jays were less successful than those with the Mets.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117779642,imgsize-41088,width-400,resizemode-4/117779642.jpg"

fans can breathe a sigh of relief ashas been cleared to play against the Golden State Warriors on Friday, January 31. The Suns' latest injury report confirms that no players are sidelined, ensuring the team will be at full strength when they take on the Warriors at Chase Center.The Suns (24-22) are looking to build momentum as they face the Warriors (24-23) in a pivotal Western Conference showdown. Having Devin Booker available is crucial, as the star guard is averaging 25.5 points per game, ranking 10th in the NBA. His presence alongside Kevin Durant and Bradley Beal gives Phoenix a strong offensive trio. Devin Booker ‚Äôs recent form has been slightly below his season average, posting 19.8 points, 3.5 rebounds, and 5.4 assists over the last 20 games. However, his ability to hit timely shots and create plays remains a significant asset for the Phoenix Suns.While Phoenix has a clean bill of health, Golden State is facing challenges. The Warriors will be without Jonathan Kuminga (ankle) and Draymond Green (calf), two key players in their rotation. The absence of Green, in particular, could impact Golden State‚Äôs defensive intensity, giving the Phoenix Suns an opportunity to capitalize in the paint. Stephen Curry continues to lead the Warriors in scoring with 22.3 points per game, while Andrew Wiggins and Trayce Jackson-Davis provide additional support. However, without Green‚Äôs defensive presence, slowing down Devin Booker and Durant will be a tough task for Golden State.Phoenix is averaging 112.7 points per game (14th in the league) but has struggled defensively, allowing 113.7 points per contest (18th in the NBA). Their three-point shooting remains a strength, with Booker leading the team at 2.7 made threes per game.On the other hand, Golden State ranks fourth in three-pointers made per game, thanks to Curry‚Äôs elite shooting. This matchup could turn into a high-scoring affair, with both teams relying on their perimeter game.Also read: Will Kevin Durant play tonight against the Golden State Warriors?

While Butler‚Äôs talent is undeniable, Kevin O‚ÄôConnor of Yahoo! Sports reports that Stephen Curry and Kerr have specific concerns about his impact on team chemistry.O‚ÄôConnor stated. Jimmy Butler has established himself as a fierce competitor and a proven leader on the court, but his past conflicts in team environments raise questions about how he would mesh with the Golden State Warriors. During his brief stint with the Timberwolves, Butler played a key role in ending their 14-year playoff drought in 2018. However, his tenure in Minnesota was short-lived after he reportedly clashed with Karl-Anthony Towns and Andrew Wiggins during a heated practice session, leading to his trade to the Philadelphia 76ers.Given the Warriors‚Äô emphasis on team chemistry and their well-documented system of unselfish play, it‚Äôs understandable why Stephen Curry and Kerr might be hesitant to bring in a strong personality like Butler.If Golden State ultimately decides against pursuing Butler, they may shift their focus to offseason opportunities.

Andy Reid has built a culture in Kansas City that balances structure with flexibility, particularly for star players like Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce. While he maintains high expectations for the entire roster, he recognizes that elite players who have earned trust through performance and leadership deserve a level of autonomy.Andy Reid's arrival in Kansas City in 2013 was a turning point for both him and the Chiefs.After 14 seasons with the Philadelphia Eagles (1999‚Äì2012), where he led the team to multiple playoff appearances and a Super Bowl berth, Reid was let go following a disappointing 4-12 season in 2012.The Chiefs, coming off a 2-14 season in 2012, needed a fresh start. Reid quickly transformed the team, making them playoff contenders in his first season (2013) with an 11-5 record. His partnership with general manager Brett Veach led to the drafting of Patrick Mahomes in 2017, setting the stage for a dynasty.Under Reid, the Chiefs have won multiple AFC Championships and Super Bowls, with Mahomes and Travis Kelce as key stars. Reid‚Äôs innovative offensive strategies and leadership have cemented Kansas City as an NFL powerhouse.In a recent interview with Colin Cowherd, Kansas City Chiefs head coach Andy Reid discussed his coaching approach with veteran tight end Travis Kelce. Reid acknowledged that he tailors his coaching methods to suit Kelce's experience and unique skill set.""We've had him my whole duration here and drafted him and so on,"" said Reid. ""So I kind of know where he's at, physically, mentally. I know what he can do in games. And, so we try to utilize him.""Andy Reid also addressed how his coaching approach with quarterback Patrick Mahomes has evolved over time.‚ÄúFour to five years ago, he didn't have the same feel he's got for the game now. And wasn't as solid with all of his surroundings there and different options,"" said Reid.""We do it differently with him now. Have a lot of trust in him and what he knows and, uh, what he can do at the line of scrimmage. And he's very accurate with that. So, it's definitely different,""he added.Reid hinted at a potential future in coaching for Kelce as questions about his playing career intensified leading up to the Super Bowl.""Travis would be a heck of a football coach. He's able to get up there and explain things and teach these young guys exactly what he sees and feels,"" said Reid.Also Read: Can the Chiefs afford to retain Trey Smith and Nick Bolton? There future remains uncertain, with the Super Bowl potentially marking their last in the uniform This personalized approach has helped create a winning culture in Kansas City. By allowing key players to lead in their own way, Andy Reid fosters an environment where talent thrives, and team chemistry remains strong. This philosophy has played a significant role in the Chiefs' sustained success, including multiple Super Bowl victories.",Andy Reid has built a culture in Kansas City that balances structure with flexibility.

PUNE: Pacer Harshit Rana, leggie Ravi Bishnoi and allrounders Shivam Dube and Hardik Pandya played starring roles as India won the fourth match of the T20I series against England on Friday, and with it the series.The home team now has a 3-1 lead following Friday's 15-run win at the Gahunje stadium, making the fifth and last match now inconsequential.Batting first, India made a competitive 181/9 after losing the toss and recovering from 12/3 after two overs. Then they restricted England to 166 for their 17th successive series win.The left-handed Dube, who came in for Washington Sundar, rode on his luck to score 53 (34b; 7x4, 2x6). He was dropped by Jos Buttler at slip off Adil Rashid before he had scored a run. Dube forged a vital partnership with Hardik Pandya (53 off 30b; 4x4, 4x6). After Dube was hit on the helmet, India managed to squeeze in a concussion substitute in paceman Rana.Harshit ended with figures of 3/33 to play a pivotal role in the game, but England should also blame themselves for some careless batting. They were 62-0 before losing three wickets for five runs.From 129-4 in the 15th over, England slipped to 146-8 after 17. The first blip was caused by Ben Duckett (39 off 19b; 7x4, 1x6), who was dealing in boundaries until he hit straight to Suryakumar Yadav at extra cover. The second came with Harry Brook's brain fade and resultant scoop off Varun Chakravarthy that ended in the hands of short fine-leg.Bishnoi (3/28) got Duckett in the Powerplay and left-armer Axar Patel removed Phil Salt the next over. Varun too did his bit with 2-28. Earlier, Hardik (53, 30b, 4x4s, 4x6s) and Dubey (53, 34b, 7x4s, 2x6s) went berserk from the 16th to the 18th over, the duo eventually putting on 87 runs off 44 balls for the sixth wicket.Hardik treated speedster Jofra Archer with disdain, clearing the ground cleanly. He also hit a breathtaking four between the tiny gap of straightened long off and deep widish long-off. He hit waist high full toss no-ball off Jamie Overton for four in the 18th over.Dube slogged, hoicked and punched boundaries and then came up with a Natraj pose four off Overton. Together, they scored 53 off 17 balls starting from the 16th over, with four fours and four sixes. The preceding 17 balls had given India just 27 runs. India's top order was not willing to gauge the pace and bounce of the wicket or the strategy of England bowlers, and they paid the price.Earlier, pacer Saqib Mahmood , who came in for Mark Wood, had a three wicket maiden in the innings' second over. Leg-spinner Adil Rashid, introduced in the eighth over, came up with another masterly exhibition of variations in speed, line and length.Dube, meanwhile, slogged, hoicked and punched boundaries and then came up with an excellent four off Overton.",India beat England by 15 runs to take a 3-1 lead in the T20 series. India made 181/9 after losing the toss and recovering from 12/3 after two overs.

We did groups of five, like one after the other. It was a rotating circle.‚ÄùHer PR team confirmed the tally, stating, ‚ÄúShe slept with 1,057 people.

What does Shubman Gill's horoscope say about his captaincy future

NEW DELHI: India pacer Harshit Rana made history on Friday during the fourth match of the five-match T20I series against England, becoming the first player to make a T20I debut mid-match as a concussion substitute among full-member teams.Rana replaced all-rounder Shivam Dube, who was struck on the back of the head by a Jamie Overton delivery in the final over of India‚Äôs innings.While the move proved crucial in India‚Äôs 15-run victory, it also sparked an intense debate over the fairness of the substitution.Former England captain Michael Vaughan was among the most vocal critics, questioning whether Rana was a genuine ""like-for-like"" replacement for Dube. The decision became even more contentious after Rana claimed three wickets for 33 runs, playing a decisive role in restricting England to 166 while chasing India‚Äôs total of 181.""I have to say the substitute ‚Äî how did they find that Harshit Rana is a like-for-like for Shivam Dube? An out-and-out bowler replacing a batter who can bowl some part-time stuff is beyond me,"" Vaughan said while speaking on Cricbuzz. ""He gets three for 33, key wickets at the key times‚Ä¶ You can‚Äôt sell me that Harshit Rana is a like-for-like replacement for Shivam Dube.""India‚Äôs move was also scrutinised by former India pacer Zaheer Khan , who acknowledged that while teams have the right to nominate a player, the match referee should have ensured that the replacement met the criteria.""Maybe Ramandeep [Singh] would have been the ideal choice,"" Zaheer said. ""The match referee‚Äôs role was to say, ‚ÄòOkay, you have nominated this player, but he doesn‚Äôt suit the criteria exactly, so suggest another player who is actually a batter who can bowl, rather than a bowler who can bat.‚Äô""Despite the controversy, India‚Äôs performance on the field was dominant. Hardik Pandya (53) and Dube (53) rescued the team from 79 for 5, forging an 87-run partnership that helped India post a competitive 181 for 9. In response, England faltered against India‚Äôs bowling attack, with Rana and leg-spinner Ravi Bishnoi (3 for 56) leading the charge.The victory extended India‚Äôs unbeaten T20I series streak at home to 17 since 2019 and sealed a 3-1 series win over England.

Even off the field as professionals you have to have certain boundaries,"" he asserted.Moin, who played in numerous on-field conflicts with India, stated that while he did not object to respecting opponent players, he did think it could be detrimental to be too friendly with them.""Our seniors always told us that when playing against India give no quarter and no need to even talk to them on the field. When you get friendly, they see it as a sign of weakness,"" said Moin.Although he never displayed it on the field, the 53-year-old claimed to have a great deal of respect for some of the Indian players of his time.""I think our players don't understand this but being too friendly is seen as a sign of weakness on the field and you automatically come under pressure in your performances,"" he said.One of the greatest regrets of players of his generation, according to Moin, is still not being able to defeat India in a ODI World Cup match.Moin, who participated in 219 ODIs and 69 Test matches, stated that India and Pakistan are two of the favorites to win the Champions Trophy.","Former Pakistan captain Moin Khan has advised the nation's cricket players to refrain from making friends with their Indian counterparts on the field.

Virat Kohli's love for chilli paneer takes over social media

All roads in Delhi led to the Arun Jaitley Stadium for the last two days, with the national capital in the grip of Virat Kohli fever, as the batting legend made his return to Ranji Trophy after 12 years.Crowd in excess of 15,000 witnessed Kohli playing for Delhi once again on Thursday, while many more thronged the stadium on Friday in anticipation of watching Kohli bat after Delhi had bowled out Railways on Day 1.The scenes of fans chanting Kohli's name reverberated the lanes leading up to the stadium gates and then echoed inside the arena, with the legend, who was fielding in the slips, interacting with the crowd on several occasions.Watching these scenes unfold, former Pakistan batter Basit Ali was in awe of the adulation and love that Kohli received from his fans.""I have seen very few players in my life, maybe just 2-3, who had such fan-following,"" said Basit on his YouTube channel. ""Aaj to Pakistan mei bhi trend bana hua tha. Sab likh rahe, 'dekho, izzat isko bolte hain' (even people in Pakistan were writing, 'see, this is called respect').""Yeh banda Delhi se kyu nahi khelta IPL mei, RCB se kyu khelta hai? (why he doesn't play for Delhi in the IPL instead of RCB),"" he cheekily added.On the first day, after Delhi captain Ayush Badoni opted to field and the fans had to wait to watch the legend bat, Kohli was seen having fun on the field, while keeping his intensity up.""He was enjoying with his old friends and the public. The fans were just waiting for him to respond and chanting 'Kohli, Kohli' for seven hours straight,"" Basit observed.""Despite not being in good form lately, he is blessed by the almighty with so much respect; I have seen that for the first time in my life for an out-of-form player.""However, the fan-fare had an anti-climax on Friday, when Kohli was dismissed for just 6 runs by Railways pacer Himanshu Sangwan -- a product of the MRF Pace Foundation under Australian legend Glenn McGrath.After hitting Sangwan for a four straight past him, Kohli played a loose shot and left a huge gap between his bat and pad, which the bowler found with his in-cutter to send the off-stump cartwheeling.The dismissal extended Kohli's poor run of form, which saw him scoring just 191 runs in 9 innings of the five Tests on the tour of Australia.","Virat Kohli returns to Ranji Trophy after 12 years with Delhi. 15,000 fans throng Arun Jaitley Stadium in Delhi to watch him bat.

J&K on top vs Baroda

MUMBAI: At the start of the season, Siddhesh Lad and Akash Anand didn't know what the future holds for them. Lad was just happy to be back in the Mumbai set up while Anand was grinding on the maidans hoping for an opportunity to come by.On Friday, both made hay by scoring centuries-along with Shams Mulani-to put Mumbai in the driver's seat against Meghalaya on Day Two of their Ranji Trophy clash at the BKC.Mumbai declared their innings at 671/7 to take a mammoth 585-run lead and by stumps had reduced Meghalaya to 27/2 in their second innings.Lad ended as Mumbai's top-scorer with his 250-ball 145 while right-hand batter Akash scored 151-ball 103.Lad now has become Mumbai's top-scorer for the season by overtaking Shreyas Iyer (480). So far, he has scored 518 runs in eight innings at an average of 86.33. They were well-supported by Ajinkya Rahane , Suryansh Shedge, Shardul Thakur and Mulani.While skipper Rahane missed out on a century and was out on 96, he shared a 327-ball 196 run third wicket stand with Lad which put Mumbai on their way. Shedge did his reputation no harm with his 74-ball 61 and was involved in a 123-run association for the fifth wicket with Akash. Shardul Thakur and Shams Mulani proved their worth with the bat by stitching a 99-ball 156 partnership for the seventh wicket. Thakur hammered a 42-ball 84 while Mulani scored an unbeaten 115-ball 100.Despite the runs, there is no guarantee that Lad will be the first choice when India players return for the knockouts. But he wants to be ready. ""I never thought that I would be playing for Mumbai again. (Now) I always play as if it's my last game,"" said the 32-year-old Lad, who played for Goa in 2022-23, took a cooling break in 2023-24 to be eligible for Mumbai this season.For 29-year-old Akash it was just about believing in his ability. ""I played cricket not to get selected but for the love of it,"" said Akash, who captains CCI.He finally got that call before the match against Services-the fifth of the Ranji campaign for Mumbai-thanks to good knocks in Kanga League A Division.But as he was getting ready for the white ball tournaments, he fractured his wrist during the Purshottam Shield match. Mumbai were looking for a wicketkeeper who would provide them flexibility in the batting order.Akash was the third keeper Mumbai have used in the Ranji XI after Hardik Tamore and Siddhant Addhatrao and he ticked that box with a century.Mumbai were taking a punt when they brought in Akash for this match in place of Tamore as he hadn't played any matches since that injury last year. ""This knock was very important for me before the knockouts as I wanted to have that feeling that I belong here,"" he added.Meghalaya 86 & 27/2 vs Mumbai 671/7 decl in 140.5 overs (Siddhesh Lad 145, Ajinkya Rahane 96, Akash Anand 103, Suryansh Shedge 61, Shams Mulani 100*, Shardul Thakur 84; Himan Phukan 3/144)In the other Group A match, Jammu & Kashmir strengthen their knockout bid by taking the first innings lead against Baroda.

NEW DELHI: When Delhi batter Yash Dhull's struggles at the crease finally ended an hour into the second day's play against Railways on Friday morning, the Ferozeshah Kotla crowd erupted in joy. It was time for the main act. Virat Kohli marched out to the middle - to bat in a Ranji Trophy game for the first time in over 12 y ears - to loud chants of ""Kohli, Kohli"" and ""RCB, RCB"".However, the thousands who had turned up were left disappointed as Kohli's stay at the crease didn't long.After facing 15 balls and hitting one cracking boundary down the ground, Himanshu Sangwan 's gentle inswinger sent Kohli's offstump cartwheeling. India's star batter trudged off after having scored just six runs, his head bowed, while Sangwan indulged in some animated celebrations. The crowd was stunned into silence. The show was over. The stadium was almost empty by the time Kohli could walk up to the pavilion.It didn't matter that Delhi captain Ayush Badoni played a thrilling knock of 99 off 77 and allrounder Sumit Mathur remained unbeaten on 78 at stumps to take Delhi to 334/7 in reply to Railways' first-innings score of 241. The few who had stayed back thronged the fencing next to the pavilion where Kohli was seated in the balcony, their eyes fixed firmly on him.Meanwhile, social media had gone into a tizzy, as usual, with Kohli fans hurling abuses at 29-year-old Sangwan, who incidentally made his Delhi U-19 debut along with Rishabh Pant The Railways bowler had been promoted to the post of a senior ticket examiner before the match, but knocking Kohli over will be etched in his memory forever.It may just be an inconsequential domestic match, but Kohli's problems against the moving ball around the off stump are real. The Railways seamers were, at best, bowling military-medium pace, but they didn't deviate from the plan of sticking to a line and length with the newish ball. Kohli had been beaten twice on the outside edge by Kunal Yadav in the previous over.The distinct lack of pace teased Kohli. Then ego got the better of him and he started walking towards the ball. It paid off when he shimmied down and smacked Sangwan straight down the ground for a boundary. It wasn't a classical straight drive. It was a quintessential T20 smack. Next ball, he saw the off stump flying behind him from almost halfway down the pitch.Railways 241 all out vs Delhi 334/7 in 96 overs (Ayush Badoni 99, Pranav Rajvanshi 39, Sumit Mathur 78 not out; Himanshu Sangwan 2/46, Kunal Yadav 2/82)",Virat Kohli's offstump cartwheels after being bowled by Himanshu Sangwan.

Dejected fans leave the stadium after Virat Kohli's early dismissal

NEW DELHI: Hardik Pandya and Shivam Dube commanding fifties were followed by an all-round effort from the bowlers as India outsmarted England by 15 runs in the fourth T20I in Pune to take an unassailable 3-1 lead in five-match series on Friday.The thrilling T20I encounter saw India's Harshit Rana making his debut as a concussion substitute and secured impressive figures of 3 for 33, helping India clinch the series.India initially struggled at 79 for 5 before Hardik and left-handed batter Shivam formed a crucial 87-run partnership for the sixth wicket, taking the team to 181 for 9 after being asked to bat first.The bowlers then bowled out England for 166, with Rana and spinner Ravi Bishnoi claiming three wickets each.The victory also extended India's remarkable unbeaten T20I series streak at home to 17 since 2019.Rana's substitution for Dube, who was struck on the helmet by Jamie Overton's delivery in the penultimate over, sparked debate among commentators.

He then claimed his first T20I wicket by dismissing Liam Livingstone, followed by Jacob Bethel's wicket.Phil Salt and Ben Duckett started strongly with a 62-run opening partnership in 36 balls but their dismissals shifted momentum towards India.Harry Brook's quick-fire 51 off 26 balls briefly revived England's chances, but his dismissal by Chakravarthy, who took another wicket in the same over, turned the match in India's favor.England's batting ten collapsed against India's spinners and Rana, with the team being dismissed in 19.4 overs.In the first innings, England's Saqib Mahmood, replacing Mark Wood, made an immediate impact by dismissing Sanju Samson for 12 with his first delivery.Mahmood then removed Tilak Varma and Indian captain Suryakumar Yadav for a duck, creating early pressure on India.Rinku Singh scored 30 and Abhishek Sharma contributed 29 runs in a counter-attacking partnership before Adil Rashid dismissed Abhishek.After Brydon Carse dismissed Rinku, Pandya and Dube, who survived an early drop by Jos Buttler, launched a strong counter-attack.Pandya's aggressive innings included four boundaries and four sixes in his 30-ball stay before Jamie Overton dismissed him.
