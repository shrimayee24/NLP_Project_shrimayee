Warriors drop latest update on Jimmy Butler injury



Is there a return timeline for Jimmy Butler



The Golden State Warriors shared meaningful news on Jimmy Butler on Monday. The franchise has offered some clarity after weeks of uncertainty. The veteran forward has undergone surgery to repair a torn right anterior cruciate ligament. While the injury ended his season, the organization described the procedure as successful, framing the update as a positive development.Butler suffered the injury on January 19 against the Miami Heat and has since missed nine games. As of now, no short-term return expectations have been attached, but the language used by the team suggests confidence in Butler’s long-term outlook and physical recovery.Golden State confirmed the surgery through an official release, Warriors PR wrote on X:""Warriors forward Jimmy Butler III, who suffered a torn right anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) on January 19 against the Miami Heat, underwent successful surgery earlier today in Los Angeles.""The organization further shared that the surgery, “a reconstruction of the torn ACL, was performed by Dr. Bert Mandelbaum.” Butler has already missed nice games and will be “sidelined for the remainder of the 2025-26 season and will begin rehabilitation immediately.”“He is expected to make a full recovery and an update on his progress will be provided early next season.”Butler played in 38 games this season and averaged 20.0 points, 5.6 rebounds, 4.9 assists, and 1.5 steals in 31.1 minutes per game.From the date of his acquisition on February 6, 2025, until his injury on January 19, 2026, the Warriors recorded 48 wins, the fourth-highest total in the NBA during that span, behind only Oklahoma City, Boston, and Detroit.Now in his 15th NBA season, Butler holds career averages of 18.4 points, 5.4 rebounds, 4.4 assists, and 1.6 steals across 907 games, including 802 starts. He has played for the Bulls, Timberwolves, 76ers, Heat, and Warriors since being selected 30th overall by Chicago in the 2011 NBA Draft following three seasons at Marquette University.The Warriors stopped short of outlining a specific return window. The team confirmed that updates on Butler’s progress will come early in the 2026-27 season, signaling a long-term recovery plan. Butler’s agent, Bernie Lee, previously described the injury as a “gut punch.”His absence has been a huge blow to the Warriors’ plans. Although his return this season is very unlikely, the Warriors can prepare him for the coming season.","Warriors drop latest update on Jimmy Butler injury.

My two cents on this mock trade

Trade talk is building around the Los Angeles Lakers as the 2025-26 season moves through February. Reports suggest the team may try to acquire Giannis Antetokounmpo in the offseason and place him alongside LeBron James and Luka Dončić If it happens, the move would show the Lakers are still focused on winning immediately. It would also raise practical questions about cost, roster balance, and whether Milwaukee would consider moving its franchise player.Giannis Antetokounmpo is under contract with the Milwaukee Bucks through the 2026-27 season and has a player option for 2027-28. He is earning $54.1 million this season and is scheduled to make $58.5 million next year. A deadline trade is unlikely, but Milwaukee could review its options in the summer depending on results and the player’s stance.The Lakers currently have LeBron, Dončić, Austin Reaves, Rui Hachimura, Deandre Ayton, Marcus Smart, Jarred Vanderbilt, Dalton Knecht, Adou Thiero, and future first-round picks. One proposed structure meets salary rules and reflects the type of return Milwaukee would likely demand.• Giannis Antetokounmpo (F, 31, $58.5M in 2026-27)• Thanasis Antetokounmpo (F, minimum contract)• Austin Reaves (SG, projected $15-18M in 2026-27)• Rui Hachimura (PF, projected $13-15M)• Dalton Knecht (SF, rookie-scale)• Adou Thiero (SF, rookie-scale)• 2026 first-round pick or swap• 2030 first-round pick swap• 2032 first-round pick swapThe package would give Milwaukee younger players and draft flexibility while allowing the Lakers to match Giannis’s salary.Adding Giannis Antetokounmpo would give Los Angeles three players who can control the offense and score in different ways.The group would provide scoring, playmaking, and interior defense. Dončić, at 26, would remain the long-term piece, while Giannis (31) and LeBron (41) suggest a shorter title window. From a business view, a roster led by two international stars and one of the league’s most recognizable players would carry strong global appeal.If the Bucks decide to move Antetokounmpo, the priority would likely be future assets. Reaves has playoff experience and a manageable contract. Hachimura adds size and flexibility. Knecht and Thiero would be developmental players. Multiple picks would give the team options to rebuild or pursue another star.Milwaukee would still have rotation players such as Myles Turner, Thanasis Antetokounmpo, Cole Anthony, and Gary Harris, so the roster would not be empty during a transition.Giannis Antetokounmpo has said he is not leaving Milwaukee, but league discussion continues about where he might consider playing if the situation changes. The Knicks and Heat are often mentioned as possible destinations.Los Angeles Lakers would offer a ready-made contender and strong market visibility. The adjustment would come from sharing possessions with two other primary creators and handling the defensive workload that comes with a fast system.- Advantages: stronger title chances, defensive improvement, and commercial impact.- Risks: reduced depth, fewer future picks, possible fit issues, and age-related durability concerns.- Advantages: draft capital, younger contributors, and avoiding a later free-agency situation.- Risks: losing the face of the franchise, uncertainty around player development, and possible fan reaction.In the short term, the Los Angeles Lakers would likely improve their championship chances. Milwaukee’s long-term result would depend on how well it uses the picks and young players.For Giannis Antetokounmpo, the decision would shape the later years of his prime, whether that means continuing as Milwaukee’s centerpiece or joining a roster built to compete immediately.Also read: NBA trade rumors: Golden State Warriors predicted to land $240 million Utah Jazz star center to support Stephen Curry and Jimmy Butler A trade sending Giannis to the Los Angeles Lakers is still speculative but possible under league rules. There is a lot of risk involved but so is the potential reward and that is a roster built around three of the league’s most productive players. The direction each team chooses later this year will determine whether the idea stays theoretical or turns into the biggest move of the 2026 offseason.",Giannis Antetokounmpo is under contract with the Milwaukee Bucks through the 2026-27 season. He is earning $54.1 million this season and is scheduled to make $58.5 million next year.

Vaibhav Sooryavanshi’s early India call-up: ‘We didn’t keep Sachin Tendulkar waiting’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/we-didnt-keep-sachin-tendulkar-waiting-growing-calls-for-vaibhav-suryavanshis-early-india-call-up/articleshow/128137897.cms,"Sachin Tendulkar abd Vaibhav Suryavanshi (Image credit: Agencies)

Special dinner for Team India at Gautam Gambhir’s house in Delhi | T20 World Cup

India’s Under-19 World Cup triumph in 2026 had many heroes, but one name towered above the rest — Vaibhav Sooryavanshi. In the final against England in Harare, the 14-year-old prodigy delivered a breathtaking performance that left the cricketing world stunned. Smashing 175 off just 80 balls, Sooryavanshi powered India to their sixth U19 World Cup title and rewrote record books in the process, including registering the highest individual score in a U19 World Cup final.The sheer audacity of his strokeplay, combined with a growing list of centuries at age-group level, has triggered a familiar debate in Indian cricket circles: should generational talents be fast-tracked?Among those voicing strong support for the idea is Congress MP Shashi Tharoor , who drew a direct parallel between Suryavanshi and one of the game’s greatest icons — Sachin Tendulkar “Vaibhav Sooryavanshi deserves to be fast-tracked into higher honours. The last time we had a 14-year-old genius at the crease, his name was Sachin Tendulkar. And we didn't keep him waiting long,” Tharoor wrote on X (formerly Twitter).The comparison is not without historical weight. Tendulkar, after piling up runs in school and domestic cricket, was ushered into the Indian team in 1989 at just 16 years of age, making his international debut against Pakistan.His rapid ascent went on to redefine Indian cricket for over two decades.Yet, unlike Tendulkar’s era, Sooryavanshi faces a non-negotiable roadblock. Despite the clamour around him, the Bihar-born left-hander cannot represent India at senior international level until March 2026.The obstacle lies in the ICC’s Minimum Age Policy, introduced in 2020 to protect young cricketers’ physical and mental well-being. Under the regulation, a player must be at least 15 years old to feature in international cricket.Born on 27 March 2011, Sooryavanshi was still technically 14 at the time of India’s World Cup triumph in February 2026.As a result, regardless of how many blistering 36-ball centuries he piles up for Bihar or how many established IPL bowlers he dismantles for the Rajasthan Royals, the national selectors have no choice but to wait.For now, even with influential voices like Tharoor echoing the Sachin precedent, Sooryavanshi’s India dream remains on pause — at least until the calendar turns to 27 March 2026.","India’s Under-19 World Cup triumph in 2026 had many heroes, but one name towered above the rest — Vaibhav Sooryavanshi.

T20 World Cup: 'God changed my destiny' - Mohammed Siraj on emotions of lucky comeback

Poll What should be India's strategy moving forward in the T20 World Cup? Maintain aggressive batting Focus on moderate targets Adapt to pitch conditions Use a balanced approach

NEW DELHI: The USA team wasn’t the only surprise package awaiting the Indian team in their opening game of the T20 World Cup last Saturday. The Wankhede square, which gripped and offered turn, was the bigger surprise. For a team that came into the tournament eyeing a 300-plus score, the excruciating struggle to post 161/9 against an ICC Associate Member must have hurt some egos.It is learnt that that the Indian team management has made its displeasure known to the Indian cricket board ( BCCI ) about the nature of the pitch in the game against USA. It’s early in the tournament and the pressure of defending a World Cup title at home must be immense. The pitch, on top of that, has challenged India’s planning for the World Cup.Not long ago, during the home series against South Africa in Dec, the team management was forced to take a step back and set relatively moderate targets to avoid batting collapses. Whether on the sluggish pitches of the UAE during the Asia Cup in Sept or the lively tracks in Australia in Oct, India’s all-out aggressive brand of batting had been challenged.The bowlers were largely the protagonists of the wins in that period. This is when the team management decided to play bold, first by dropping vice-captain Shubman Gill and then by re-adopting the attack-at-all-cost approach. It defines head coach Gautam Gambhir ’s T20 ethos. The results followed in the home series against New Zealand preceding the T20 World Cup. The only match that India dropped in the five-match series was in Vizag, where the ball appeared to grip the surface when India batted second.Going forward, India have matches in New Delhi, Colombo and Ahmedabad in the league matches. The square here at the Ferozeshah Kotla has a reputation of being a high-scoring one since 2023. The pitch has got rest only in the last three weeks after non-stop cricket since the last IPL. In Colombo, meanwhile, the pitches have appeared sluggish.TOI understands that India’s think-tank has a preference for high-scoring games. The awe-inspiring and record-shattering scores against New Zealand last month happened at venues that offered pitches as hard as concrete slabs and heavy dew that made the balls feel as if they were submerged in water.Dew, incidentally, hasn’t been a major factor yet in this early stage of the World Cup.“The pitch in Mumbai was a bit surprising. India should not get cautious if the pitches offer a bit of help for the bowlers. The team’s strength lies in its aggressive approach. Yes, they should also have alternate ways of scoring runs but they must not give up on the attacking game,” said former India cricketer Deep Dasgupta, adding, “The last game against USA was a classic example where caution was the last resort. If they run out of power-hitters, they can switch to a conservative approach. They have players with those skills, as they showed in the low-scoring Asia Cup. In T20s, sometimes all you need is four overs of momentum to swing the match in your favour. That can only happen with a positive mindset.”India’s comfort zone is highscoring games on belters, where they can bank on a formidable bowling lineup to restrict the opposition. But it is also true that in World Cups, very big totals have proven difficult to achieve. It’s up to the Indian team to take the pitch out of the equation.","The pitch at the Ferozeshah Kotla in Delhi has a reputation of being a high- scoring one since 2023.

Notably, the A+ category has been scrapped, a move that has reshaped the contract hierarchy.Senior stalwarts Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma have been placed in Group B, a downgrade that was largely expected following their retirement from Tests and T20Is respectively, effectively making them one-format players. Under the current criteria, which factors in performances and the number of matches played in the preceding season, they were no longer eligible for the top bracket.For the first time in his career, Shubman Gill finds himself in the highest pay grade, as the two-format captain was retained in Group A alongside Jasprit Bumrah and Ravindra Jadeja . While the BCCI has not officially disclosed the retainership amounts, Group A was previously valued at Rs 5 crore annually, with Group B and C fetching Rs 3 crore and Rs 1 crore respectively before the A+ category was abolished.The decision to do away with A+ stems from the fact that Bumrah is now the only player who remains an automatic selection across all formats.The category, introduced during the COA era for all-format excellence, previously featured only Kohli, Rohit, Jadeja and Bumrah.The men’s list has been trimmed from 34 to 30 players, with Shami’s exclusion seen as a strong signal that he may be out of the selectors’ immediate plans. Kishan, Mukesh and Sarfaraz were also dropped after failing to play a single international match during the evaluation period. While Kishan has returned to the T20I setup, that comeback falls in the new cycle.One notable inclusion is Sai Sudharsan, the only new entrant in the senior men’s contract list.On the women’s side, Harmanpreet Kaur, Smriti Mandhana and Deepti Sharma retained their Group A status, while Jemimah Rodrigues earned a promotion following her standout World Cup performances.","Mohammed Shami, Rajat Patidar, Sarfaraz Khan, Mukesh Kumar and Ishan Kishan missing out despite being part of the previous cycle.

Which teams could target Vincent Trocheck, Conor Garland, and Bobby McMann before the deadline?

New York Rangers TRADE Vincent Trocheck To Detroit Red Wings? | NHL Trade Rumors

MY GOD! WHAT A HUGE TRADE! SENDING TWO CANUCKS PLAYERS AWAY? VANCOUVER CANUCKS NEWS TODAY!

Vincent Trocheck's name is rapidly gaining prominence in NHL trade rumors, especially after the New York Rangers' trade involving Artemi Panarin. As the March 6 trade deadline approaches, curiosity is growing throughout the league regarding the Rangers' next move.Meanwhile, Conor Garland of the Vancouver Canucks and Bobby McMann of the Toronto Maple Leafs have also become subjects of speculation. Three different teams, three different situations, but the common factor is that contenders are viewing these players as potential roster upgrades.After Artemi Panarin’s trade to the Los Angeles Kings, attention in New York has turned to Vincent Trocheck. The 32-year-old center carries a $5.625 million cap hit through 2028-29, making him a valuable long-term piece. Sportsnet’s Elliotte Friedman reported the Kings attempted to acquire him in the Panarin deal, but Trocheck prefers to stay in the Eastern Conference and has a 12-team no-trade list. Friedman also indicated that the Detroit Red Wings had shown interest in him during 2022, while RG.org’s Marco D’Amico believes they will make another attempt because they require a center and have sufficient salary cap room.Conor Garland maintains his position as a player who creates trade rumors for the Vancouver team management.Thomas Drance of The Athletic reported that Garland and Brock Boeser are not actively being shopped, but the Canucks would consider the right offer. The Province’s Paul Chapman pointed out that Garland’s new six-year, $36 million extension — which includes a full no-movement clause starting July 1 — could complicate any potential deal. Teams appreciate his competitive nature and physical playing style, but some organizations hesitate to approve his extended contract because they want to evaluate his future performance.Bobby McMann has become a player whom Toronto teams should watch if the Maple Leafs decide to trade away their players. Friedman reported that Toronto is seeking a first-round pick in return, reflecting McMann’s perceived value around the league. The interested teams, which include Colorado, Dallas, Edmonton, Minnesota, and Vegas, have already made their first-round picks for 2026, which will force the Leafs to change their trade demands as they approach the deadline.The upcoming trade deadline makes Vincent Trocheck the most important player to follow after the Rangers traded Panarin, while Conor Garland and Bobby McMann maintain their ability to attract interest from other teams. The upcoming playoff race will experience significant changes based on the choices that New York, Vancouver, and Toronto will make during the next few weeks.","After Artemi Panarin’s trade to the Los Angeles Kings, attention in New York has turned to Vincent Trocheck.

Tasha K Leaks Alleged Receipts: Stefon Diggs Scandal Shakes Up Super Bowl LX

(Image via: Tasha K's X)

""Everything is alleged... draw your own conclusions,""

As the world watches Super Bowl LX today, a messy off-field drama is threatening to overshadow the big game. A viral series of ""alleged"" receipts from celebrity blogger Tasha K has put Patriots star Stefon Diggs in the hot seat, just hours before he is expected to propose to Cardi B The drama started when Tasha K posted a scathing series of tweets claiming that Stefon Diggs had a woman named Pree on the secured NFL practice field at Levi’s Stadium yesterday.According to Tasha K, Pree was spotted wearing an official ""WAGs"" (Wives and Girlfriends) jacket and was accompanied by Diggs’ own mother and inner circle.Tasha K emphasized that practice field access is strictly regulated, meaning Pree could only be there with authorized team clearance usually reserved for a player's primary partner. To back up the claim, the blogger shared ""alleged"" photos of the group on the field, asserting that Pree is a long-time associate of Diggs who ""goes way back"" with his family.This report is especially explosive because Cardi B is currently in San Francisco to support Diggs in the biggest game of his career. The couple welcomed their son just three months ago in November 2025.Cardi has reportedly spent over $1.2 million this weekend on private jets and luxury suites for 100 guests to celebrate Diggs. Tasha K and Cardi B have a bitter legal history; Cardi famously won a $3.9 million defamation lawsuit against the blogger in 2022. Tasha K’s latest ""leak"" is being seen by many as a calculated move to disrupt Cardi’s high-profile weekend. In her tweet, Tasha K remained defiant, stating,while reminding followers she was right about previous pregnancy rumors.Before this scandal broke, the main narrative was whether Diggs would propose to Cardi B on the field after the game, a move he teased during media week as being ""on the agenda."" Now, the question is whether Cardi will show up to the game at all, or if the ""Pree"" sightings will trigger the ""done"" clause of her ultimatum.","Tasha K claims Stefon Diggs had a woman named Pree on the secured NFL practice field at Levi’s Stadium yesterday.

Key things to monitor in tonight's Nuggets vs Cavaliers game

when theface the Cleveland Cavaliers on Monday at Ball Arena. The center is listed as probable on the injury report with a left ankle sprain, which usually means a player is expected to be available unless something changes close to tipoff.Denver has also indicated that Jokic is on track to suit up, and betting markets reflect the same expectation. With several Nuggets dealing with injuries, his availability carries added importance heading into this matchup.The NBA’s injury report from February 9 lists Nikola Jokić as probable with an ankle issue, and Denver’s February 8 report carries the same update. Christian Braun is also probable with a left ankle sprain, while Jamal Murray is questionable because of left hip inflammation.Cleveland is short on frontcourt depth. Evan Mobley is out with a left calf strain, and Max Strus remains sidelined after left foot surgery. Jaylon Tyson and Dean Wade are both questionable with left ankle sprains.Given the absences on both sides, Denver is expected to rely heavily on Jokic to organize the offense.Nikola Jokic returned in late December 2025 after missing time with a left knee bone bruise and has played regularly since then.In a recent stretch that included more than 30 minutes in three straight games, he averaged about 28 to 29 points, 12 rebounds, and 10 to 11 assists. He shot close to 59 percent from the field and over 40 percent from three-point range during that span.The ankle sprain appeared more recently and created some uncertainty before a game against Chicago. He was still considered day-to-day and expected to play. His current probable status suggests the team believes he can handle his normal role, though a slight reduction in minutes remains possible.The Denver Nuggets are trying to maintain their place in a competitive Western Conference, making Jokic’s presence important against a strong Cavaliers team finishing a road trip.Denver is already without Aaron Gordon, Peyton Watson, and Spencer Jones. That leaves Jokic with a larger share of the scoring and playmaking duties. Despite his expected availability, the Nuggets enter the game as slight home underdogs, showing how much the team depends on him when the roster is thin.If he plays, Denver will likely run its offense through him at the high post and in pick-and-roll situations to challenge Cleveland’s size and perimeter defense.• Minutes: Denver could manage his workload because of the ankle, but the stakes of the game may require extended playing time.• Partnership with Murray: If Murray is cleared, their pick-and-roll remains central to Denver’s half-court offense.• Defensive pressure: Cleveland may send extra defenders, which often allows Jokic to create open shots for teammates such as Braun.Fantasy players and bettors should still check for a final update before the game, but the probable tag points toward him being available.Also read: Cleveland Cavaliers vs Denver Nuggets injury report: Who's playing, injured and questionable players, head-to-head records, team stats, and more (February 9, 2026) Nikola Jokic is expected to play against the Cleveland Cavaliers and is officially listed as probable with a left ankle sprain.

Joel Embiid's Official injury report details vs Portland Trail Blazers (February 9, 2026)

Joel Embiid's Recent performance and team impact

What the questionable tag usually means

When will Embiid's status will be confirmed

Thewhen they take on the Portland Trail Blazers on Monday night. The center is listed as questionable, and a final decision is expected closer to tip-off.Embiid is dealing with right knee injury management, the same concern the team has monitored since his return from last season’s knee issues. Philadelphia has been careful with his workload, especially during long stretches of games.The league’s injury report lists Joel Embiid as questionable for the Philadelphia Phillies vs Portland Trail Blazers matchup because of his right knee. Team updates reflect the same status as the Sixers finish a five-game trip through the Western Conference.This has been a familiar pattern. When Embiid is available, he plays major minutes, but the team avoids using him in back-to-back games and evaluates the knee regularly. Philadelphia has prioritized his long-term availability rather than pushing him into every regular-season contest, which is why his status often remains unsettled until game day.Embiid has been productive when on the floor. Over his last 18 games since late December, he has averaged 30.1 points, 8.2 rebounds, and 4.7 assists in 34.4 minutes per game.He is shooting 52.4% from the field and 37.5% from three-point range during that span.The Sixers are 13-5 in those games and currently hold a top-six spot in the Eastern Conference. With home-court advantage still a priority, the staff must decide whether to play Embiid in the final game of the trip or give him extra rest before the team returns home.For Joel Embiid, questionable typically means the training staff will check the knee after shootaround and again before the game. If his mobility is normal and the discomfort is manageable, he usually plays. If there is swelling or stiffness, the team has shown a willingness to hold him out.The situation is worth watching because this is the last game of a five-game road stretch. Portland is also managing several injuries, which could factor into the decision. At the same time, Philadelphia has won six of its last seven games and may prefer to keep that run going before the All-Star break.The clearest update should come about 90 minutes before tip-off, when the final injury report is released and team reporters share availability. Warmups can also offer a hint. If Embiid moves well during drills, the chances of him playing improve.If he does not play, Tobias Harris and Kelly Oubre Jr. are expected to see more time in the frontcourt. Tyrese Maxey and Quentin Grimes would likely take on a larger share of the scoring. If Embiid is cleared, the Philadelphia 76ers regain their primary scoring option and interior presence.Also read: Philadelphia 76ers vs Portland Trail Blazers injury report: Who's playing, injured and questionable players, head-to-head records, team stats, and more (February 9, 2026) As of February 9, 2026, Joel Embiid has not been ruled out, but he is not guaranteed to play.

Philadelphia could be without a key starter due to suspension, while Portland is missing multiple contributors on both ends of the floor. The status of Joel Embiid and Robert Williams III could influence the style of play and the result.Philadelphia 76ers (30-22, 6th in East) are managing injuries along with one suspension.• Joel Embiid (C) - Questionable (right knee; injury management). He has missed games at different points this season. If he plays, Philadelphia gains a clear advantage inside.• Paul George (F) - Out (league suspension). His absence removes an important wing defender and scorer.• Kelly Oubre Jr. (F) - Available (left knee; injury recovery - brace). He is expected to play, though his minutes may be monitored.Tyrese Maxey, Jared McCain, Adem Bona, Kyle Lowry, and Trendon Watford are expected to be active unless there is a late change.Portland Trail Blazers (25-28, 9th in West) enter the game with several injured players.• Deni Avdija (F) - Questionable (low back strain). His defense and playmaking are important for Portland.• Scoot Henderson (G) - Probable (left hamstring; injury management). He is expected to play but could see limited minutes.• Damian Lillard (G) - Out (left Achilles tendon; injury management). He is not expected to return this season after surgery.• Kris Murray (F) - Out (lumbar strain).• Shaedon Sharpe (G) - Out (left calf soreness).• Matisse Thybulle (G) - Out (right knee tendinopathy).• Robert Williams III (C) - Questionable (left knee; injury management).Jerami Grant, Donovan Clingan, Jrue Holiday, and the rest of the available rotation are expected to play unless there is a late update.Philadelphia leads the regular-season series 64-61 across 125 games.• Dec. 30, 2024 (Portland): 76ers 125, Trail Blazers 103 - Joel Embiid finished with 37 points and nine rebounds.• Mar. 3, 2025 (Philadelphia): Trail Blazers 119, 76ers 102 - Andre Drummond recorded 25 points and 18 rebounds.This is the first meeting between the teams this season.Philadelphia is usually more efficient in the half court when Embiid plays, as his presence helps create space for Tyrese Maxey. Portland leans more on guard play and transition scoring but has struggled defensively with key perimeter players out.If Embiid and Williams both play, the game may slow down and focus on interior scoring. If neither is available, the pace could increase.- Interior matchup: If Embiid is active, he is likely to face Donovan Clingan, Yang Hansen, and possibly Williams. Philadelphia would have the advantage near the basket.- Maxey against Portland’s guards: Maxey is averaging about 25-26 points and 6-7 assists. With Sharpe and Thybulle out, he may see less resistance on drives and perimeter shots.- Perimeter defense: Portland is without one of its top defenders in Thybulle, which could affect its ability to contest shooters.- Offense without Lillard: Portland has relied on Henderson, Holiday, and Grant to handle scoring duties. Half-court execution becomes important against a structured defense.- Bench production: Philadelphia’s second unit, including McCain, Watford, and Bona, has provided steady minutes. Portland’s bench depth has been affected by injuries.Philadelphia has the advantage if Embiid plays, even without Paul George.

I’m so proud of our entire team, staff, and the artists who believed in the vision and mission @KidRock @brantleygilbert @leebrice @GabbyBarrett_ It’s okay to love Jesus and your country.”Charlie Kirk’s wife continued, “Ultimately, this is what it’s all about, making Heaven crowded…I love you Charlie baby, this is all for you.”While there were many rumors of the Turning Point USA cancelling the “All-American Halftime Show”, the rumors were debunked as Vice President JD Vance was spotted attending the event along with his wife.A few hours before the show began, Kid Rock appeared on Benny Johnson’s podcast where he spoke on why Turning Point USA is hosting an alternative and said, “don’t let the left twist this around… in no way with any hate in our hearts.”The Nashville country singer continued, “We’re simply gonna go play some great songs for our base, people who love football, love America, love good music and love Jesus.”Both Bad Bunny and Kid Rock’s shows have sparked major debates across the country as President Donald Trump even slammed the Grammy winner’s record breaking performance.While there have been many controversies surrounding the 31 year old Puerto Rican Bad Bunny’s performance at Super Bowl LX halftime show, the Grammy winner has stayed away from commenting on it.Just hours after his performance, fans were quick to spot his team’s social media account had deleted all posts on their account.","Charlie Kirk’s organisation, Turning Point USA, hosted its alternative - the “All-American Halftime Show” with Kid Rock.

Both sides are expected to rely on shortened rotations, which could affect scoring, defense, and lineup balance.Memphis is missing key players in the backcourt and frontcourt, while Golden State will also be without major offensive pieces. With the regular season moving toward its final stretch, games like this carry added importance for teams trying to stay competitive in the standings.Memphis will be without multiple rotation players, including its starting point guard and two centers.• Ja Morant (PG) - Out (sprained left elbow UCL)• Santi Aldama (C) - Out (right knee; injury management)• Zach Edey (C) - Out (stress reaction in left ankle; rehab ongoing, re-evaluation in six weeks)• Brandon Clarke (F) - Out (Grade 2 right calf strain; expected back in 4-6 weeks)• Walter Clayton Jr. (G) - Questionable (right calf contusion)Jaren Jackson Jr., Jock Landale, Cam Spencer, Cedric Coward, and the remaining guards are expected to handle larger roles.Golden State will also be without several contributors, including its starting point guard and a frontcourt scorer.• Stephen Curry (PG) - Out (right patellofemoral pain syndrome; expected back around Feb. 11)• Kristaps Porzingis (C) - Out (left Achilles; expected back around Feb. 19)• Seth Curry (G) - Out (left sciatic nerve irritation)• L.J. Cryer (G) - Questionable (left hamstring)Draymond Green, Moses Moody, Brandin Podziemski, and the guard rotation are likely to see increased minutes.The Golden State Warriors lead the season series 1–0 after the teams met on October 27, 2025. The Warriors won 131–121 behind Jonathan Kuminga’s 25 points, while Ja Morant scored 23 for the Memphis Grizzlies in the loss.The teams will meet again on February 25, 2026, in Memphis to complete the three-game season set. Both rosters look different now because of injuries.The teams have similar scoring numbers. Golden State shoots slightly better, while Memphis averages more rebounds.Morant’s absence removes the team’s primary ball handler and scorer. Injuries to Aldama and Edey reduce frontcourt depth, which should lead to heavier minutes for Jaren Jackson Jr. and Jock Landale.Cam Spencer and Cedric Coward are expected to take on more responsibility in the backcourt.Stephen Curry’s absence affects spacing and half-court offense. Without Porzingis, Golden State also loses size and rim protection, which could result in Draymond Green playing more minutes at center.The Warriors will need consistent scoring from their perimeter players.• Jaren Jackson Jr. (PF/C) - Leads the team with 19.2 points per game and averages 1.5 blocks.• Cam Spencer (PG) - Averaging 5.6 assists and shooting 46.0% from three-point range.• Jock Landale (C) - Shooting 51.4% from the field and expected to provide interior presence.• Draymond Green (PF) - Averaging 5.6 rebounds and 5.2 assists while directing the defense.• Moses Moody (SG) - Shooting 40.2% from three-point range.• Brandin Podziemski (G/F) - Averaging about 11.2 points and 4.8 rebounds with a larger playmaking role.Golden State has the better record and home court, but both teams are missing several starters. Memphis must adjust without Morant, Aldama, Edey, and Clarke. Golden State is playing without Curry, Porzingis, and Seth Curry.Memphis may look to score inside through Jackson, while Golden State will depend on outside shooting and ball movement.Also read: Is Ja Morant playing tonight vs the Golden State Warriors?

Tactical edges that could decide the Oklahoma City Thunder vs Los Angeles Lakers game

Thehave a match with theon Monday, February 9, 2026. This game is kind of important for both the teams as it could affect playoff positioning in the Western Conference. Oklahoma City holds the league’s best record at 40-13, while the Lakers are 32-19 and are not far from the top of the standings.Both teams are missing important players and this could be a deciding factor in which side comes out more successful in tonight's game. The Thunder will play without their top scorer, and the Lakers are adjusting to the absence of Luka Doncic. Depth and defensive execution are likely to play a large role.Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is out with an abdominal strain and is not expected back until around February 20. Ajay Mitchell is also sidelined with an abdominal injury, Nikola Topic continues to recover from testicular surgery, and Thomas Sorber is out for the season after tearing his ACL.Jalen Williams had been managing a hamstring issue and was previously a game-time decision, but he was not listed on the latest report.Jared McCain, who was away for non-injury reasons, has returned to the rotation.Chet Holmgren leads the active group alongside Luguentz Dort, Isaiah Joe, Cason Wallace, Aaron Wiggins, Jaylin Williams, Kenrich Williams, Alex Caruso, Isaiah Hartenstein, Branden Carlson, Chris Youngblood, Brooks Barnhizer, and Buddy Boeheim. Despite the injuries, Oklahoma City still has several lineup options.Luka Doncic will miss the game because of a left hamstring strain. Adou Thiero is also out with a right MCL sprain. Deandre Ayton is listed as probable with knee soreness and is expected to play.LeBron James continues to handle a heavy workload, averaging about 21.9 points, 6.0 rebounds, and 6.7 assists. Austin Reaves, Rui Hachimura, Marcus Smart, Luke Kennard, Jaxson Hayes, Jake LaRavia, Drew Timme, Jarred Vanderbilt, Nick Smith Jr., Chris Manon, Kobe Bufkin, and Maxi Kleber are expected to be available.The teams last played on November 12, when Oklahoma City won 121-92. Gilgeous-Alexander finished with 30 points and nine assists, while Doncic had 19 points and seven assists. The Thunder shot better than 48 percent from the field and controlled the rebounding.Oklahoma City leads the season series 1-0. The remaining matchups are scheduled for April 2 in Oklahoma City and April 7 in Los Angeles. The Lakers still hold a slight edge in the all-time record, though the gap has narrowed in recent years.The Thunder average 120.3 points per game while shooting 48.9 percent from the field and 35.9 percent from three-point range. They record 43.5 rebounds, 25.4 assists, 9.9 steals, and 5.9 blocks per game, and shoot 82.7 percent from the free-throw line.With Gilgeous-Alexander out, Holmgren becomes the primary scoring option. He typically produces around 23-25 points, 8-9 rebounds, and more than two blocks. Isaiah Joe and Luguentz Dort provide outside scoring, while Wallace and Wiggins take on more ball-handling. Defensively, Oklahoma City relies on length and rim protection.The Lakers average 116.1 points on 49.7 percent shooting and 35.1 percent from three. They post 41.3 rebounds, 25.1 assists, 8.2 steals, and 4.1 blocks, while shooting 77.1 percent from the line.Without Doncic, James is expected to run the offense. Reaves adds secondary playmaking and shoots close to 87 percent from the free-throw line. Hachimura is converting roughly 43 percent of his three-point attempts. Smart and LaRavia provide perimeter defense. If Ayton plays, his size could help against Holmgren, with Hayes and Timme supporting the frontcourt.Oklahoma City has an advantage in size and lineup flexibility, often using multiple strong defenders at once. The team also pushes the pace and spaces the floor with shooters such as Joe, Wiggins, and Boeheim.The Lakers will depend on James to create scoring chances, especially through pick-and-roll actions that free shooters like Reaves, Kennard, and Hachimura. Ayton’s interior scoring could matter if Oklahoma City sends extra help toward the ball. Experience from James, Smart, Reaves, and Vanderbilt may also be important late in the game.Smart and Reaves are likely to handle more of the ball, with Nick Smith Jr. and Kobe Bufkin providing relief minutes. Oklahoma City is expected to rotate Dort, Wallace, and Caruso onto James with support near the rim.Three-point shooting could influence the result, particularly the matchup between Isaiah Joe and the Lakers’ perimeter scorers.","Oklahoma City Thunder play Los Angeles Lakers on Monday, February 9, 2026.

Golden State Warriors

Why is Stephen Curry ruled out vs Memphis Grizzlies (February 10, 2026)

What is Curry's knee issue?

Curry's possible return timeline

How Golden State Warriors may adjust without Stephen

What this means for the Warriors

against the Memphis Grizzlies on. Thehave ruled him out because of a right-knee issue, removing any uncertainty about his status before the game at Chase Center.This is another game the Warriors must manage without their leading scorer and playmaker. With the Western Conference standings tight, Golden State will need production from the rest of the roster to handle a Memphis team that relies on speed and defensive pressure.The NBA injury report released on February 9 lists Stephen Curry as “Out” with right patellofemoral pain syndrome. Beat reporters covering the team have confirmed he will not be available.His absence changes how the Warriors operate on offense. Curry’s shooting range usually stretches defenses and creates space for teammates. Without that threat, passing lanes shrink and defenders can stay closer to the paint. Memphis is likely to pressure ball-handlers and make other Warriors take difficult shots.Team doctors have identified Stephen Curry’s condition as right patellofemoral pain syndrome, commonly known as runner’s knee.It causes irritation around the kneecap and is often worsened by running, jumping, and sudden changes in direction.Records show Curry has missed several games with knee soreness across January and early February. The situation appears related to overall wear rather than a single injury. Keeping him out against Memphis signals the team is focused on preventing the problem from getting worse.Current tracking suggests Curry could remain out until at least February 11, 2026. That puts the next game in question, though the Warriors have not set a firm return date.He will be evaluated as the knee responds to treatment and reduced workload. At 37, and with heavy minutes over many seasons, the team is unlikely to rush him back.The Golden State Warriors lose their main offensive organizer when Curry sits. Ball movement slows, spacing tightens, and others must create their own shots more often.Brandin Podziemski and the rest of the guard rotation are expected to handle more scoring duties. The frontcourt may also be asked to help with playmaking while protecting the rim. Memphis will likely trap more and force the ball away from primary handlers.The focus now is whether Golden State Warriors can stay competitive until Curry returns. Each win matters as teams position themselves for the postseason.Also read: Is Ja Morant playing tonight vs the Golden State Warriors? Latest update on the Memphis Grizzlies star's injury report (February 9, 2026) For fantasy players and bettors, Curry should be treated as unavailable for this matchup. The bigger concern for the Warriors is getting their point guard healthy and back on the court without risking a longer absence.","Golden State Warriors' Stephen Curry ruled out against Memphis Grizzlies.

Lady Gaga honors Bad Bunny’s vision during Super Bowl LX halftime show

During Super Bowl LX on Sunday night, February 8, fans inside Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara and millions watching at home were caught off guard when Lady Gaga walked onto the halftime stage. The appearance lasted only a few minutes, but it became one of the most talked-about moments of the night. Gaga joined Bad Bunny during his historic halftime performance, adding an emotional and cultural layer to a show already packed with energy.A few hours later, Gaga explained why the moment mattered so much to her. In an Instagram post shared early Monday, February 9, she thanked Bad Bunny for the invitation and made it clear this was never about stealing attention. “It was my absolute honor to be a part of Benito’s halftime show,” she wrote. “I wouldn’t miss it for the world.” The message quickly spread online, with fans praising the respect she showed toward the artist and the culture at the center of the show.Lady Gaga’s appearance was carefully planned and deeply respectful. She performed a completely reworked, salsa-inspired version of “Die With a Smile,” her Billboard Hot 100 No.1 song with Bruno Mars.The track was reshaped to match the sound of the night, backed by live horns and percussion that fit Bad Bunny’s Puerto Rican-led production. The performance focused on rhythm, movement, and joy rather than spectacle.After the song, Gaga shared the stage with Bad Bunny for a brief dance moment before stepping away and letting him continue with “BAILE InoLVIDABLE.” The transition felt smooth and intentional. It kept the spotlight where it belonged.Her outfit also carried meaning. Gaga wore red heels and a flowing blue strapless dress, finished with a large red Flor de Maga brooch.The flower is Puerto Rico’s official symbol, and the detail did not go unnoticed by viewers familiar with its significance. This marked Gaga’s third Super Bowl appearance.She previously sang the National Anthem in 2016 and headlined the halftime show in 2017. Still, this moment felt different. It was smaller, quieter, and rooted in support rather than performance dominance.Bad Bunny’s halftime show was widely praised for celebrating Puerto Rican culture, music, and community. Gaga’s presence added warmth without changing that message.Her words afterward made that intention clear. “Thank you Benito for inviting me and thank you to the entire cast for welcoming me onto your stage,” she wrote on Instagram.",Lady Gaga joined Bad Bunny during the Super Bowl LX halftime show.

‘Sevak of Mumbai’: Ritu Tawde poised to take charge as mayor as BJP consolidates dominance in BMC power structure,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/sevak-of-mumbai-ritu-tawde-poised-to-take-charge-as-mayor-as-bjp-consolidates-dominance-in-bmc-power-structure/articleshow/128141235.cms,"Ritu Tawde to take charge as Mumbai Mayor on February 11





MUMBAI: BJP corporator Ritu Tawde is all set to become Mumbai’s next mayor after being elected unopposed in the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) polls.The mayoral election, scheduled for Wednesday at noon, will formally mark her taking charge as the city’s eighth woman mayor, nearly three years after the previous woman mayor held office between 2019 and 2022.Tawde’s elevation ends an uninterrupted 25-year run by the Shiv Sena in the BMC mayoral office and represents the BJP’s first mayoral win in Mumbai since Prabhakar Pai’s tenure in 1982–83. Her deputy mayor will be Sanjay Ghadi of the Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena, who will serve a 15-month term before rotation, while the mayoral post carries a 2.5-year term.The path to her unopposed victory was cleared after the Uddhav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena (UBT) decided not to field a candidate against Tawde, reportedly following a meeting at Thackeray’s residence.Former mayor and Sena (UBT) leader Kishori Pednekar said the decision was made out of respect for Marathi identity, acknowledging the arithmetic of the Mahayuti alliance in the 227-member civic body.Tawde, 53, a two-time corporator from Ghatkopar East, filed her nomination at the municipal secretary’s office in the presence of senior Mahayuti leaders, including minister Mangal Prabhat Lodha and BJP Mumbai chief Ameet Satam.Speaking to reporters, she said she would function as a “sevak” of Mumbai rather than merely as mayor, promising to prioritise citizens’ safety, development, and overall quality of life.A second-time corporator, Tawde first won in 2012, chaired the BMC’s Education Committee, and raised civic concerns ranging from infrastructure improvements to public safety. She lost the 2017 civic elections but returned to office in the latest polls, securing 19,810 votes from her Ghatkopar ward.BJP leaders emphasised the symbolic importance of Tawde’s election, highlighting the alliance’s commitment to a corruption-free administration. Satam said, “Ritu Tawde will lead the city and work to free the BMC from the clutches of corruption which the previous UBT-led administration had allowed to flourish. Our priority is to ensure Mumbai’s continued progress.” The Mahayuti had also pledged that the mayor would represent Marathi and Hindu identity, reflecting the alliance’s promise during the BMC election campaign.The BJP emerged as the single largest party in the civic polls, winning 89 seats with 11,79,273 votes, accounting for 21.58% of the total votes cast. Its alliance partner, the Shinde-led Shiv Sena, secured 29 seats with 2,73,326 votes. The UBT faction of Shiv Sena, in alliance with the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS), won 65 seats, while the Indian National Congress managed 24 seats. The MNS contributed six seats to the alliance tally.The opposition NCP (SP) sharply criticised the BJP’s choice of Tawde, a former Congress leader, saying it demoralised loyal BJP corporators who had worked extensively for the party. NCP (SP) spokesperson Clyde Crasto said, “By selecting a former Congresswoman as mayor, the BJP has insulted its own loyal corporators who have given their blood, sweat and tears for the party.”On the deputy mayoral front, Sanjay Ghadi, a corporator from Ward No. 5 who defected from Sena (UBT) to the Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena, was nominated by the Mahayuti for the post. Party secretary Sanjay More confirmed that the tenure would be split, allowing multiple corporators to hold the deputy mayor’s post during the term.The mayoral post in Mumbai, while largely ceremonial, carries significant political and symbolic weight, particularly in a city where identity-driven politics often intersect with civic administration. The BMC itself, India’s richest municipal body, has been under a state-appointed administrator since March 2022. Its budget for 2025–26 is pegged at Rs 74,450 crore, larger than the annual budgets of several Indian states.The Urban Development Department had last month reserved the mayor’s post for a woman from the open category after a lottery draw, setting the stage for Tawde and Sion corporator Rajeshree Shirwadkar as potential candidates. However, the Mahayuti kept its nominations under wraps until the final day, ensuring a smooth, uncontested outcome. Opposition parties did not file any nominations, completing the process before the withdrawal deadline on February 11.Tawde’s victory represents not only the BJP’s return to the mayoral office after four decades but also a consolidation of the Mahayuti alliance’s dominance in Mumbai’s civic politics. Speaking to ANI, she reiterated her commitment to working as a servant of the city, saying, “I am very happy that the people of Mumbai have given a good mandate to Mahayuti. After assuming office, I will work as a sevak of Mumbai, not as its mayor. ”With the unopposed elections now set, Mumbai prepares for a historic transition in the BMC leadership, signaling a new chapter in the city’s governance after nearly three decades of Shiv Sena control.","Ritu Tawde is all set to become Mumbai’s next mayor after being elected unopposed in the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) polls. Her deputy mayor will be Sanjay Ghadi of the Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena, who will serve a 15-month term before rotation.

‘Adopted from Korea’: Private tutor recounts claims by Ghaziabad sisters weeks before suicide; were ‘very weak’ in studies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ghaziabad/adopted-from-korea-private-tutor-recounts-claims-by-ghaziabad-sisters-weeks-before-suicide-were-very-weak-in-studies/articleshow/128134829.cms,"Gzb sisters introduced themselves to pvt tutor with Korean names





GHAZIABAD: The three sisters who alleged died by suicide at their house in Bharat City last week were recently taken to a private tutor, where they introduced themselves with Korean names - Maria, Aliza and Cindy - and told her they had been adopted from Korea and China.The tutor found them ""very weak"" in studies, struggling with even basic calculations and failing to recognise numbers.""They were very weak in studies, but I decided to give them time because they had not been going to school since Covid. They didn't have books, so I gave them one each for English, maths and Hindi. When I gave them some basic calculations, like additions and multiplications, they failed to recognise numbers. They couldn't even copy numbers or letters from textbooks,"" the tutor told TOI.Home assignments were left incomplete too. ""I asked them to learn tables of 2 and get ready for a test the next day. But they came without any preparations. When I sought to know the reason, they gave a weird answer - that they had been adopted from China and Korea. I asked their father about it. He told me about their fixation with everything Korean,"" she added.With their lack of focus on studies, the tutor decided against continuing to teach the girls. Around 20 days before their alleged suicides, she returned her fees to their father, Chetan Kumar.On Feb 4, the three sisters - aged 16, 14 and 12 - were found lying next to each other on the society premises in Bharat City, directly below their ninth-floor window. They were taken to hospital and declared dead on arrival.The sisters' upbringing was marked by isolation. Since Covid, they had stopped going to school and were not tutored at home either. Bereft of friends, they became increasingly dependent on each other and on an online fantasy life dominated by Korean culture.They had even launched a YouTube channel last year around K-dramas and cartoon characters - gaining more than 2,000 followers - but it was deleted about 10 days before their deaths. An officer said the channel was removed after their father objected to what he saw as their growing fixation with Korean culture. Kumar allegedly told interrogators that his daughters were ""living in their own world"" and repeatedly spoke about going to Korea after watching reels and other social media content.Ghaziabad police have now recovered a mobile phone that belonged to one of the sisters, a development that could potentially be the first digital lead in a case that has largely depended on the family's version. The handset had been sold by their father about 15 days before their deaths and was seized from an electronics shop in Shalimar Garden. It has been sent for forensic examination to retrieve deleted data.DCP (trans-Hindon) Nimish Patil said Kumar had bought two phones around six months ago for the eldest daughter and her 14-year-old half-sister, believing they would become ""famous like YouTubers"". ""He sold one of the phones three months ago, and the other one just 15 days before the suicides,"" Patil said.Police said the second phone was sold for Rs 15,000 at the Shalimar Garden shop and the owner still had the device when cops visited on Monday.Both phones are crucial to verify what the sisters were consuming online and whether they were in touch with anyone outside the family. ""All crucial data on the phone was already deleted before it was sold. Now, we have sent the mobile set to a forensic lab to recover the data, such as apps and the girls' social media accounts. If we can retrieve the information, we will know about friends the three girls made online, and how much time they spent browsing the internet. We are trying to recover the second phone with the help of surveillance,"" Patil said.","Sisters introduced themselves to pvt tutor with Korean names - Maria, Aliza and Cindy.

PUNE: BJP significantly expanded its reach in Maharashtra's rural belt as it emerged the single largest party in the zilla parishad and panchayat samiti elections in 12 districts, results for which were announced on Monday. Elections were conducted for 731 ZP and 1,462 panchayat samiti seats on Saturday.In Pune rural, NCP swept the ZP elections, riding a sympathy wave following Ajit Pawar's demise in a plane crash on Jan 28. The party won 51 of 73 seats in Pune district, securing the rural body for a fourth straight term.BJP has nearly doubled its numbers in this election, winning seats across all 12 districts, including several regions where it had a minimal presence earlier. It has topped the list with 225 ZP seats and 459 panchayat samiti seats, followed by NCP with 165 ZP and 306 panchayat samiti seats, and Shiv Sena with 162 ZP seats, according to figures available at the time of going to press. Overall, the Mahayuti won 552 of 731 ZP seats and more than 1,000 of the 1,462 panchayat samiti seats, PTI quoted the State Election Commission as saying. In the MVA, Congress won 55 ZP seats, followed by 43 for Shiv Sena (UBT) and 26 for NCP (SP), PTI reported, adding that MNS won a seat each in Latur and Ratnagiri.BJP won the Solapur ZP poll with a majority, while in Satara and Sangli ZPs it will need the help of Mahayuti partners. In Kolhapur ZP, NCP emerged the single-largest party and may take BJP and Shiv Sena along to take charge. Congress has won 15 seats here and, altogether, has got 18 members elected, including local fronts and Independents the party supported. In Sangli, NCP (SP) emerged the single-largest party, winning 18 seats. MVA parties together won 30 seats in Sangli, just one short of the majority mark of 31.BJP also emerged the leading party in the ZP elections in Sambhajinagar, Parbhani and Dharashiv districts in Marathwada region. Congress secured the top position in Latur. Overall, the outcome highlighted a major setback for NCP, as well as Congress, both of which traditionally enjoyed support in rural areas and continued to dominate in 2017 elections. NCP, which was the single largest party in these districts in 2017, has slipped to second spot.Congress saw its seat tally drop by nearly half compared to 2017. In Pune district, it drew a blank in ZP election compared to seven last time. A similar trend was visible in Sindhudurg, where Congress had won a decisive majority in 2017 with 27 of 50 seats; it did not win any this year.PM Modi lauded Mahayuti's win: ""Once again, Maharashtra blesses BJP and Mahayuti! My compliments to every worker of Mahayuti for working tirelessly on the ground and elaborating on the solid track record of Maharashtra govt as well as NDA's vision for good governance.""The NCP swept the zilla parishad elections in Pune district, buoyed by a wave of sympathy following Ajit Pawar’s passing in a plane crash on Jan 28. The party clinched 51 of 73 seats, securing the rural body for a fourth straight term and reaffirming its enduring dominance across rural Pune, home to one of India’s largest industrial clusters.The mandate highlighted NCP’s extensive grassroots network and strategic coordination, supported in several pockets by quiet backing from members of NCP (SP).Analysts said the ZP polls were crucial for NCP, following significant setbacks in the Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad municipal corporation elections. Determined to reclaim political ground, Ajit Pawar had overseen the campaign strategy for the polls, holding nu-merous meetings to finalise candidates for both ZP and panchayat samiti seats.Members of the Pawar family and NCP politicians described the results as a tribute to Ajit Pawar. While BJP led the overall tally with 225 ZP seats, NCP won 165 across the 12 districts that went to the polls on Feb 7.Rohit Pawar, NCP (SP) MLA and Ajit Pawar’ nephew, said people paid tribute to Ajitdada by ensuring the party’s victory in the ZP polls in Pune and Sangli districts, as well as in 33 panchayat samitis across the state. “Had he been with us, success would have been even greater,” he stated. Agriculture minister Dattatray Bharne said the party’s performance was the result of Ajit Pawar finalising candidates and selecting strong contenders","BJP has nearly doubled its numbers in this election, winning seats across all 12 districts.

Mumbai witnesses rare spectacle as 64 embrace Jain diksha in mass renunciation at Borivali,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-witnesses-rare-spectacle-as-64-embrace-jain-diksha-in-mass-renunciation-at-borivali/articleshow/128137914.cms,"City pauses as 64 step into ascetic life in landmark Jain diksha at Borivali

Before dawn, a city gathers

4am

Under the gaze of the acharyas

A chorus of conviction

Youthful renunciation, shared resolve

Public life meets spiritual life

Sacred ground, renewed legacy

Faith with responsibility





Mumbai woke up on Sunday to a sight rarely witnessed in a modern metropolis: 64 mumukshus stepping away from worldly attachments and into the austere discipline of Jain diksha. The occasion — Sanyamrang Utsav at Chikuwadi Ground, Borivali West marked one of the most significant collective renunciation ceremonies the city has seen in recent years.What unfolded was not merely a ritual, but a powerful public affirmation of faith, restraint and spiritual courage.Devotees arrive at 4am as Borivali prepares for historyLong before sunrise, streams of devotees began converging on Chikuwadi. By, families, elders, youth groups and community leaders had taken their places, determined not to miss a moment.Within hours, the vast ground was filled beyond capacity, with estimates placing attendance at over 50,000 people. The atmosphere was reverent yet electric — quiet anticipation layered with emotion, devotion and collective pride.A rare congregation of spiritual authorityThe ceremony unfolded under the guidance and blessings of some of Jainism’s most revered spiritual leaders, including Gachchhadhipati Acharya Som Sundar Suriji, Acharya Yogtilak Suriji, Acharya Kushalchandra Suriji and Acharya Punyasundar Suriji.They were joined by a large congregation of sadhus and sadhvis, lending the event unmistakable gravity.As the diksharthis accepted the vows of restraint, discipline and renunciation, the silence of the gathering spoke louder than words.‘Jainam Jayati Shasanam’ echoes across ChikuwadiAt around 9.30am, the ritual offering of the rajoharan transformed the ground into a single, resonant voice. The chant — “Jainam Jayati Shasanam” — rose from thousands of throats, creating a moment many described as overwhelming.For families, it was a delicate mix of pride and parting. Tears flowed freely, yet faith remained steady. The pain of separation was tempered by the belief that their loved ones had chosen the highest spiritual calling.A young couple’s decision stands outAmong the 64, one decision drew particular attention. Rishabhbhai, a young social worker associated with Adhyatma Parivar, and his wife Sonalben chose renunciation together. Embracing lifelong celibacy at a young age, their shared resolve became a powerful symbol of commitment in an age often defined by material aspiration.Their choice drew prolonged applause — and deep reflection.Political leaders acknowledge the momentMaharashtra cabinet minister Mangal Prabhat Lodha attended the ceremony, paying homage to the courage of the diksharthis and the emotional strength of their families. Several senior figures from the Jain community, trustees and representatives of religious organisations were also present, underscoring the wider social resonance of the event.Chikuwadi’s growing spiritual historyChikuwadi Ground already holds a special place in Jain collective memory. Nearly seven years ago, it hosted 44 dikshas. With Sunday’s ceremony, the number of initiations conducted on the same ground has risen to 108, giving the space near-mythic status within the community.An environmentally conscious celebrationEven at this scale, the organisers remained attentive to environmental concerns. Plastic and disposable items were avoided during food distribution, while volunteers ensured cleanliness throughout the day — demonstrating that spiritual discipline can extend beyond ritual into everyday responsibility.","64 mumukshus step away from worldly attachments and into the austere discipline of Jain diksha.

BENGALURU: The suspense over whether the Royal Challengers Bengaluru will play their Indian Premier League (IPL) home games at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium is set to end on Wednesday, with the state home minister calling for a meeting with the state-appointed committee to take a final call on resumption of matches at the venue.The Bengaluru-based franchise indicated it's ready to blink by holding its first-ever meeting — since the June 4 stampede that left 11 fans dead — with Karnataka home minister G Parameshwara on Monday. COO Rajesh Menon, KSCA president Venkatesh Prasad and other representatives also attended the meeting facilitated by KSCA.""At the Wednesday meeting, senior govt, police and law officials will discuss what can be done at the govt level and instructions to be given to the KSCA. The extent of redressal of issues flagged by the Justice D'Cunha committee will have to be considered. We need the CM's approval,"" Parameshwara said.The iconic venue has not hosted any major match since the stampede during RCB's IPL victory celebrations. The stadium is currently undergoing tweaks and upgrades in line with the 17 recommendations of the D'Cunha committee. Karnataka Crowd Control Bill, passed in August 2025, remains a major sticking point for the franchise.At the same time, the Bengaluru franchise has held talks with Chhattisgarh govt about adopting Raipur as home base and has also considered playing a few matches in Navi Mumbai. No alternative has been finalised yet.KSCA has initiated work on most recommendations, though one suggestion — providing parking within the stadium premises — has been deemed impractical. Key measures underway include creating single-level ground access across the stadium, developing large holding areas at multiple points, widening entry and exit gates, and earmarking dedicated areas for ambulances and fire engines. The work is expected to be completed by March 15.""They are implementing necessary measures. Whether the city will be part of the IPL schedule is another matter. While people, especially the youth, want cricket matches in Bengaluru, safety is equally important,"" the minister added.Prasad described Monday's interaction as ""positive"". Beyond IPL, KSCA is keen on the resumption of hosting international matches. Hinting at a favourable decision, he said, ""Since RCB are the champions, the inaugural is expected to be held at their home ground.""",Royal Challengers Bengaluru have not played at M Chinnaswamy Stadium since the June 4 stampede that left 11 fans dead.

Beat the Netherlands 3-2 at home in the Qualifiers Round 1 in Bengaluru.

BENGALURU: Late on Sunday, he helped give Indian tennis something to dream about, but the last eight months themselves have been something out of a dream for Dhakshineswar Suresh.A final year Communications student at Wake Forest University in North Carolina, the 25-year-old, currently ranked 470 on the Tour, defeated seven players in the top-170 during the period. The biggest of those wins came over the weekend after he outplayed the Netherlands’ Jesper De Jong, a World No. 88, in the Davis Cup Qualifiers Round 1. Dominant service games and powerful groundstrokes caught everybody’s attention. There was more to come.As Sunday slipped into the next day, Suresh became the toast of the nation when he powered India into the second round of qualifiers with a famous win over Guy den Ouden in the decider. It was his booming serve that did the trick as he went on hammer 15 aces in the decisive fifth rubber, and ensured that India will now meet South Korea away in the second round of Davis Cup qualifiers in September.Sending down thunderbolts has become Suresh’s trademark, the result of years of consistent practice.He oils his smooth service motion daily, sending down around 50-100 serves in training.It helps that he stands 6 ft 6 inches in his socks. His height plays a big role, as the Madurai man enjoys a higher contact point to meet the ball at full extension. This creates a steeper angle, which adds greater pace as it leaves the racquet. “I put my height to use and I work on my strengths. I try to get a basket of serves daily in training. It is always about the consistency,” said Suresh, who had enjoyed one of his best serving days last month against Croatia’s Duje Ajdukovic with 20 aces in the first round of the Bengaluru Open ATP 125 Challenger.“When I get into crucial moments, I tell myself that I did this a million times in training, so it is just another ball that I am going to hit. The serve is about practice, day in and out. That is how I trust myself on the serve,” he explained.Although the speed gun was unavailable in his last three tournaments he has competed in Bengaluru — World Tennis League, Bengaluru Open and Davis Cup — it was easy to see the ball fly off his racquet. His flat, powerful serve pushed opponents on the backfoot, which created an opening for him to close points.And even when his first serve deserts him, Suresh possesses a potent second kick serve that jumps sharply off the court. It is little wonder then that he recorded 33 aces and just six double faults across three singles matches in the Davis Cup. He had defeated Jerome Kym, ranked 155 then, of Switzerland, in his Davis Cup debut in Biel last year.India’s non-playing captain Rohit Rajpal shed more light on what he called a “gifted serve”. “Suresh has got a beautiful whip on his serve, which is difficult to achieve unless you have a loose stance and swing. He has a beautiful service motion, and that is why he gets great speed too. He has a very gifted serve. Not every tall player can serve well,” he said.Besides his serve, Suresh is also comfortable at the net, a skill sharpened through doubles play in college tennis. It was evident when Suresh paired with Yuki Bhambri in the doubles against the Dutch.A big test awaits Suresh on the Tour once he completes his degree in May. “I’ll finish my studies in the US, then come down in May and figure out my schedule. Once sorted, I’ll start getting into the Tour and prepare for the next Davis Cup,” he said.",India beat the Netherlands 3-2 in the Davis Cup Qualifiers Round 1 in Bengaluru.

NEW DELHI: Having been pushed to the brink by lower-ranked Nepal in their tournament opener, England will be keen to deliver a more convincing display when they face the West Indies in a high-stakes Group C clash of the T20 World Cup on Wednesday. With both sides having lifted the trophy twice, the contest carries added significance as they chase a third title, alongside co-hosts and defending champions India.England were given a timely reminder of how unforgiving the shortest format can be. Despite facing a side several places below them on paper, the Harry Brook-led outfit found themselves in a dogfight, eventually scraping through with a narrow four-run victory. The tense finish underlined how fine the margins are in T20 cricket and served as a warning that reputation alone offers no guarantees.That close call is likely to keep England sharp as the tournament progresses. While they walked away with two points, their performance left room for improvement, particularly in tightening key phases of the game against quality opposition.The need for a stronger showing is also reflected in the Group C standings.England currently sit third despite their win, with a net run rate of 0.200. Scotland occupy second place on the table, also on two points but with a healthier NRR of 0.950.The West Indies, meanwhile, have made a stronger early statement. They too have two points from their opening fixture but top the group on net run rate, boasting an impressive 1.750. That sets up Wednesday’s clash as a crucial encounter, not just in terms of points but also momentum and table position.The England vs West Indies T20 World Cup match will be played on Wednesday, February 11.The match will start at 7:00 pm IST, with the toss scheduled for 6:30 pm IST.The England vs West Indies T20 World Cup match will be held at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai.The match will be broadcast live on the Star Sports Network.Live updates and coverage will be available on TimesofIndia.com.Brandon King, Shai Hope(w/c), Shimron Hetmyer, Rovman Powell, Sherfane Rutherford, Jason Holder, Romario Shepherd, Akeal Hosein, Matthew Forde, Gudakesh Motie, Shamar Joseph: Philip Salt, Jos Buttler(w), Jacob Bethell, Tom Banton, Harry Brook(c), Sam Curran, Will Jacks, Liam Dawson, Jofra Archer, Adil Rashid, Luke Wood: Harry Brook (c), Jos Buttler (wk), Tom Bandon (wk), Phil Salt (wk), Ben Duckett, Jacob Bethell, Sam Curran, Liam Dawson, Will Jacks, Jamie Overton, Rehan Ahmed, Jofra Archer, Adil Rashid, Josh Tongue.Shai Hope (c&wk), Johnson Charles (wk), Shimron Hetmyer, Brandon King, Rovman Powell, Sherfane Rutherford, Quentin Sampson, Roston Chase, Jason Holder, Romario Shepherd, Matthew Forde, Akeal Hosein, Shamar Joseph, Gudakesh Motie, Jayden Seales.","England take on the West Indies in the T20 World Cup on Wednesday.

T20 World Cup Groups Explained: Who Can Reach the Super 8

NEW DELHI: Namibia’s training session on the eve of their T20 World Cup opener against the Netherlands here followed a familiar script of cones laid out, throwdowns hurled and drives clipped into the outfield. Yet, standing slightly apart from the bustle, arms folded and eyes following every movement, was a figure whose presence carried quiet authority. Gary Kirsten doesn’t wear the Namibian colours but his imprint on this squad is already unmistakable.Kirsten, the former India head coach and South Africa opener, has joined Namibia as a consultant for the T20 World Cup. It is a role that suits him: low on noise, high on influence. For a team still navigating the thin line between associate ambition and elite-level consistency, Kirsten’s arrival offers reassurance and edge.Namibia captain Gerhard Erasmus is clear about what Kirsten brings. There is, first, the obvious pedigree. Kirsten has toured the subcontinent extensively as a player, coached in the IPL and most memorably guided the India team under MS Dhoni to the 2011 ODI World Cup triumph.“He (Kirsten) has lots of experience. He brings a winning edge to our campaign.He also brings lots of knowledge of the different grounds in India,” Erasmus said.Besides trophies, what seems to resonate far more with this Namibian group is how Kirsten goes about his work. Erasmus hinted that the influence is subtle but deeply felt. “It’s very nice in terms of management that you have such pedigreed mentor-cumcoaches who really like to bring the human side to their coaching first and they really like to connect with the players at a deeper level,” Erasmus said.For a side like Namibia, where players often balance cricketing dreams with semi-professional realities, a player-first approach carries even greater weight.“That’s what (having a playerfirst approach) we respect most about Gary and all the other coaches. Cricket is very much conditions based and it’s awesome to have him,” the 30-year-old Namibian captain said.",Gary Kirsten has joined Namibia as a consultant for the T20 World Cup.

T20 World Cup Groups Explained: Who Can Reach the Super 8

NEW DELHI: The idea of minnow teams always sat uneasily with T20 cricket. The ongoing T20 World Cup is exposing why. Short formats compress power, preparation and pressure into spaces where pedigree matters less than conviction.As Namibia prepare for their tournament opener against the Netherlands at the Arun Jaitley Stadium here, both teams arrive knowing they are no longer gatecrashers. In fact, they are participants in a competition increasingly defined by those brave enough to punch above their weight. Both are slotted alongside India, Pakistan and USA in Group A, a pool that has already hinted it will be anything but predictable. The Dutch come into the game nursing frustration. Against Pakistan, they bossed long phases, read conditions well and pushed the favourites into corners, only to unravel in the final stretch. Fast bowler Paul van Meekeren captured the mood with blunt honesty. “I want to be very clear: Pakistan didn’t win the game. We lost the game against ourselves.”It was a line that underlined not defeat but missed opportunity. Two points were there for the taking; instead, the Netherlands now carry the burden of knowing they cannot afford another slip from a winning position.Yet, if history is any guide, this Dutch side thrives when written off. They have beaten England and South Africa in T20 World Cups before, and their current core is steeped in franchise and county-level grind.Batting lynchpin Colin Ackermann spoke about embracing chaos rather than fearing it.“Part of the DNA of this Netherlands team is that we take ownership of our performances and our roles. We learn from past experiences. When we got off the bus in Delhi, coach Ryan Cook said the past is the past — there’s nothing we can do about it, and we must look forward to the next game,” the 34-year-old said. “We have great self-belief as a team. We’ve shown in the past that we can compete with Test nations.”Namibia, meanwhile, arrive with quiet confidence. They may not have played yet in this edition, but winning memories of past T20 World Cups — victories over Sri Lanka (in 2022) and other higher-ranked sides — still lingers.Captain Gerhard Erasmus has built a side unwilling to be boxed into labels like “minnows” or “Associate” team. “We respect every opponent, but we don’t see ourselves as passengers,” Erasmus said. “When the tournament starts, rankings don’t walk onto the field, players do. You should not limit yourself with labels.”","Netherlands take on Namibia in T20 World Cup opener in New Delhi. Both teams arrive knowing they are no longer gatecrashers.

Anthony Edwards will play tonight

Minnesota Timberwolves

Anthony Edwards injury report vs the Atlanta Hawks (February 9, 2026)

Minnesota Timberwolves relying on Edwards as playoff race tightens

Anthony's availability matters after Sunday’s loss

when thehost the Atlanta Hawks at Target Center. He was listed on the injury report earlier in the day with “right foot injury maintenance,” but the team has confirmed that he is active and will start in the backcourt.The listing caused some concern before the game, largely because of his recent foot issues. That uncertainty is now gone, and Minnesota will have its leading scorer available as it looks to get back on track.Anthony Edwards has been dealing with soreness in his right foot since late 2025, when a toe-related injury and infection forced him to miss several games in December. Since returning, the Timberwolves have regularly included him on the injury report with either a “questionable” tag or a maintenance designation.Even with those labels, he has not missed a game in 2026 and continues to play heavy minutes. The latest listing is viewed as precautionary rather than a sign of a new injury, with the team focused on managing his workload during a busy part of the schedule.Edwards is averaging about 25.9 points, 4.7 rebounds, 3.3 assists, and 1.1 steals per game entering Monday. His scoring and ability to create shots continue to drive Minnesota’s offense.The Timberwolves are 32–22 and sit sixth in the Western Conference, making each game important as the All-Star break approaches.Atlanta comes in at 26–28, ninth in the Eastern Conference, and depends heavily on Jalen Johnson, who is averaging around 23.4 points per game. The Hawks use a perimeter-based offense and are expected to rotate defenders on Edwards, with De’Andre Hunter likely among the primary matchups. Slowing his drives and pull-up shooting will be a priority, though he has consistently created his own offense this season.Anthony Edwards has remained durable despite the repeated maintenance tags, helping Minnesota Timberwolves stay competitive in the standings. His availability is notable after the team’s 115–96 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers on Sunday, a game that exposed defensive problems.For fantasy players and bettors, his confirmed status improves Minnesota’s outlook. He has recorded several high-usage games recently, including performances near the 30-point mark, and the matchup could allow him to score again.Also read: Atlanta Hawks vs Minnesota Timberwolves injury report: Who's playing, injured and questionable players, head-to-head records, team stats, and more (February 9, 2026) As of February 9, 2026, Anthony Edwards is active and starting against the Hawks.

T20 World Cup: 'That was the difference' - USA's Shadley Van Schalkwyk on Suryakumar Yadav

Brief scores:

Zimbabwe produced a clinical allround display to beat Oman by eight wickets, chasing down a modest target of 104 with more than six overs to spare in their T20 World Cup opener in Colombo on Monday.Oman’s innings never gained momentum, thanks to a disciplined new-ball spell from Blessing Muzarabani . The pacer removed Jatinder Singh and Aamir Kaleem before having Karan Sonavale caught behind as Oman slumped to 17/4 in four overs. Left-arm pacer Richard Ngarava added to the damage, finding movement to dismiss Hammad Mirza and later slicing through the middle order to finish with three wickets.After the early collapse, Sufyan Mehmood anchored the innings with a patient 25 off 39 while wicketkeeper Vinayak Shukla provided a brisk 21-ball 28 to give Oman innings semblance of respectability. Pacer Brad Evans’ late three-wicket burst ensured that Oman were bowled out for 103 in 19.5 overs.Zimbabwe’s chase was a mere formality. Brian Bennett set the tone with seven boundaries in his unbeaten 48 off 36 deliveries. Tadiwanashe Marumani added early impetus with a rapid 21 from 11 balls before falling to Sufyan Mehmood, who briefly raised Oman’s hopes with two wickets in an over. Brendan Taylor’s composed 31 steadied the ship before captain Sikandar Raza finished the proceedings with a boundary.Zimbabwe 106/2 in 13.3 overs (Brian Bennett 48*; Sufyan Mehmood 2/12) beat Oman 103 all out in 19.5 overs (Vinayak Shukla 28; Richard Ngarava 3/17, Blessing Muzarabani 3/16, Brad Evans 3/18) by 8 wkts",Zimbabwe produced a clinical allround display to beat Oman by eight wickets.

Kid Rock Or Bad Bunny? Trump’s Preference Shakes Super Bowl Talk

Candace Owens explains why both Bad Bunny and Kid Rock Super Bowl halftime shows failed her





Candace Owens did not pick a side during the 2026 Super Bowl halftime debate. Instead, she rejected both choices in one blunt post that quickly spread online. The political commentator criticized the official halftime show by Bad Bunny and the conservative-backed alternate show led by Kid Rock, saying neither one worked for her. Her main issue was not music style or politics alone. It was what she felt the night had turned into, two loud camps trying to sell identity instead of entertainment. In a post shared on February 8, 2026, Candace Owens said she was tired of the constant left-versus-right framing and called it boring.The Super Bowl featured Bad Bunny’s Spanish-language performance, while Turning Point USA streamed its own “All-American Halftime Show.” Both shows pulled huge attention, but also strong reactions. For Candace Owens, the problem was simple. She said viewers were being pushed to choose a political label instead of just enjoying the game. Her final line summed up her mood: “The left vs. right grift is actually boring now. ”In her post on X, Candace Owens said she “hate[s] both options.” She first pointed to Bad Bunny, saying the official halftime show was presented “without a word of English spoken.”She then turned to the alternate broadcast organized by Turning Point USA, which featured Kid Rock. Candace Owens accused the group of paying advertisers and influencers to make the show look bigger than it was. She claimed the view numbers were pushed to appear record-breaking.Her frustration was not aimed at one side alone. She questioned why entertainment now feels tied to political teams. Ending her post, she asked, “What exactly are we doing here, America?”According to UNILAD, the Turning Point USA event included performances by Brantley Gilbert, Lee Brice, and Gabby Barrett. The show was promoted as a patriotic alternative to the main broadcast.Meanwhile, BBC reported that Bad Bunny became the first artist to perform an entire Super Bowl halftime show in Spanish. His set focused on Puerto Rican culture and unity and included guest appearances by Lady Gaga and Ricky Martin. He ended by saying, “God bless America,” and showed the message, “Together, We Are America.”U.S. President Donald Trump criticized the performance on Truth Social, calling it “absolutely terrible.” The BBC also noted that Bad Bunny avoided direct political messages during the show, despite his past comments on immigration.",The political commentator criticized the official halftime show by Bad Bunny and the conservative-backed alternate show led by Kid Rock.

A video of two cows taking a tour inside a new house on the occasion of housewarming has been doing the rounds as it caught the attention of India-hating Texas commentators who condemned the 'zero intention of integrating'. The video was originally posted on the Facebook page of Texas Gaushala in January this year. ""Family welcoming Gau Mata (Mother cow) from Texas Gaushala on the auspicious occasion of their house-warming (Griha Pravesh) ceremony. The sacred presence of Gau Mata during house-warming invites prosperity, protection, and divine blessings into the new home,"" the post read.Calling the mindset 'prehistoric', an X handle shared the video which went viral riding on the present anti-India atmosphere in Texas. ""When the house is brand new but the mindset is prehistoric. Welcome to Texas: Buy a brand-new million dollar house in a Dallas suburb, then let cows wander across the marble floors like it’s a barn. Zero intention of integrating,"" the post read, facing equal amount of praise and hatred for Indians and Indian culture.Several social media users pointed out that it was the owners' discretion how they wanted to do their housewarming, while several others pointed out that it is better than an alcohol party.""Strange world we live in: A house-warming with alcohol is called 'modern,' but welcoming a sacred living being- the symbol of life and sustenance -is called 'prehistoric.' To some, a house is just bricks and mortar. To us, it is a temple. We don't just move into a space; we invite Prana (life force) into it first. If Nandi is happy, the home is blessed,"" one wrote.""Jesus Christ. This is likely in a residential area. Not zoned for agriculture, which is what is required to have livestock on property. Why do we allow these newcomers to flaunt all of our laws? We need to start making a lot of noise at these zoning meetings. Disgrace,"" another wrote.While Texas is one of the states with the highest Indian population, the hate is visibly growing, with Texas Governor Greg Abbott freezing H-1B hiring in state agencies and universities. Texas has also announced an investigation into three Indian firms that hired H-1Bs in the past seeking the details of these employees.",A video of two cows taking a tour inside a new house on the occasion of housewarming has been doing the rounds.

In a bizarre case, police in Pakistan’s Rawalpindi district registered a case on Sunday of abduction against a “jinn” (supernatural spirit) following the disappearance of an 11-year-old boy, news agency ANI reported, citing ARY News.The incident occurred in the garrison city when the boy went missing from his home on January 21. After ten days without any sign of the child, his father approached the Taxila Police Station and filed a First Information Report (FIR).In the FIR, the father alleged that supernatural entities, known locally as jinns, had forced his son to run away.The complainant said that this is not the first time such an incident has occurred. He added that the jinns had “abducted” his son several times before.He highlighted that while the boy had returned home after previous incidents, this time ten days had passed without his return, prompting him to formally accuse the supernatural spirits of kidnapping.According to ARY News, similar claims have been reported in Pakistan’s legal system before. In Lahore, a mother had lodged a case against jinns over the disappearance of her married daughter, a matter that eventually reached the courts.A report by Dawn in September stated that a special investigation team of Lahore police was formed under the directions of the city's high court Chief Justice Aalia Neelam to probe the six-year-old case of the missing woman, believed to have been abducted by a jinn.The team, headed by Lahore Investigation DIG Zeeshan Raza, was tasked with locating and recovering the woman.","11-year-old boy went missing from his home in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, on January 21.

Two French adventurers have completed an epic journey on foot from France to Shanghai, arriving on Saturday after nearly a year and a half and crossing 16 countries almost entirely on foot.Loic Voisot and Benjamin Humblot celebrated their arrival on the Bund promenade, with Shanghai’s skyline in the background.The pair began their journey from Annecy in September 2024.""We were thinking about this moment almost every day for more than a year now, so it's a really strong feeling,"" Humblot was quoted as saying by AFP after reaching the destination.""I think first and foremost we're proud, especially of having dared to do this... We weren't sure we'd make it, but we told ourselves we'd try it out,"" he added.The pair have known each other since the age of 10 and attended secondary school and university together.They said the idea for the journey emerged during a casual conversation after work, when they realised they both wanted a “great adventure.” They decided to travel to China without flying, citing environmental concerns, and planned to make the journey on foot.""When we talked about adventure, (China) came up quickly. Then we had this slightly crazy idea of going on foot,"" Humblot said.Apart from a short stretch in Russia completed by bus for safety reasons, they walked for 518 days, covering around 12,850 kilometres (7,980 miles) before reaching Shanghai.""We're both conscious of climate change, and the responsibility humans bear for it... there are some actions we can take individually,"" Voisot, a climate consultant said, as cited by AFP.Around 50 people gathered at the starting point for the final 10-kilometre stretch, including local residents who had followed their journey on social media. Their following grew along the route, with media, French residents in Shanghai and others joining them along the way.The French duo said they faced significant challenges during the journey, including harsh winters and a desert crossing in Uzbekistan. “There were very hard winters, we had to cross the desert in Uzbekistan,” Voisot said, adding that he was proud of “having had the willpower to always keep going.”Humblot said they generally ate well during the trip but noted that they both missed French cheese.Asked what he would do first after completing the journey, Voisot replied that he would, “sleep a lot!”","Loic Voisot and Benjamin Humblot began their journey from Annecy in September 2024.

HBO unveils first look of Dominic McLaughlin as Harry Potter in reboot





Draco Malfoy, the scheming schoolboy who served as Harry Potter's rival in J K Rowling's fantasy series has emerged as an unlikely mascot for China's Lunar New Year celebrations, according to Reuters.Images of Malfoy played by actor Tom Felton in the film adaptations, have begun appearing on red festive decorations and merchandise across China, from posters and door hangings to phone covers.The surge in popularity is linked to the Chinese translation of his surname, Ma-er-fu, which combines the characters for ""horse"" and ""fortune,"" making it an auspicious fit for the Year of the Horse.Social media platforms have been flooded with photos of fans pasting red Malfoy posters on their doors.On e-commerce platform Taobao, shoppers can buy a set of four Malfoy posters for 11 yuan ($1.60), Reuters reported.Social media posts showed a massive image of Malfoy in his Hogwarts uniform draped across several floors of a shopping mall in central China’s Henan province.The Harry Potter franchise continues to enjoy strong popularity in China, despite foreign films accounting for only a small share of box office revenues due to strict quotas and a growing focus on domestic productions.Warner Bros has agreed to develop a Harry Potter Studio Tour in Shanghai in partnership with Chinese conglomerate Jinjiang International, the group announced last year.Meanwhile, Beijing’s Universal Studios theme park features The Wizarding World of Harry Potter, a dedicated area with themed rides and attractions. Adding to the renewed interest, all eight Harry Potter films were re-released in Chinese cinemas in 2024.","Draco Malfoy, the scheming schoolboy who served as Harry Potter's rival, has emerged as an unlikely mascot for China's Lunar New Year celebrations.Images of Malfoy played by actor Tom Felton in the film adaptations, have begun appearing on red festive decorations and merchandise across China.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127916193,imgsize-45686,width-400,resizemode-4/127916193.jpg"

Mapping took longer than expected

Stone walls hint at older shorelines



Oxygen fades quickly below the surface layers





Blue holes are among the least understood features of the ocean floor. From the surface, they can appear ordinary, even calm, blending into the surrounding reef or open water. Below, however, they drop steeply and change quickly. The Sansha Yongle Blue Hole, also known as the Dragon Hole, sits in the South China Sea and has drawn scientific attention for more than a decade. Once confirmed as the deepest known blue hole at just over 301 metres, it has since lost that record to a deeper site in Mexico. Even so, its structure, chemistry and isolation continue to make it one of the most closely studied blue holes in the world. Researchers see it less as a record holder and more as a natural archive shaped by time, water and climate.One of the most striking findings is that the Dragon Hole is not a simple vertical shaft. Detailed surveys show that it bends and tilts as it goes down. The deepest point lies more than 100 metres sideways from the surface entrance. Near the top, the opening is wide. Deeper down, the space narrows sharply, then opens again in places. The uneven form reflects a long and complex history rather than a single collapse.Early attempts to measure the hole were limited by its shape.Turning walls and steep angles confused positioning systems. In 2017, scientists used a high grade underwater robot equipped with precise navigation tools. This made it possible to map the interior in three dimensions and confirm the depth accurately. Multiple instruments were used and cross checked, resulting in a final depth of 301.19 metres with very small uncertainty.For years, the interior resisted clean measurement. Instruments lost their bearings as walls tilted and passages curved. In 2017, researchers returned with a more capable underwater robot, fitted with precise navigation tools. Progress was slow but steady. The result was the first full three dimensional map of the hole, along with a confirmed depth of 301.19 metres. Several instruments were used, checked against one another, then checked again.Inside the hole, the rock tells its own story. Ledges appear at certain depths. Some resemble steps. These features line up with ancient sea levels, formed when the ocean stood lower during colder periods. The hole seems to have grown in stages, opening and reshaping as water levels rose and fell. Reef limestone dominates the walls, marked by side cavities that appear without warning.One of the sharpest changes is not in shape, but in chemistry. Below roughly 90 to 100 metres, oxygen nearly disappears. Above this level, some life persists. Below it, conditions turn still and harsh. The water does not mix easily with the surrounding sea. Oxygen is used up and not replaced. In deeper layers, hydrogen sulphide becomes detectable, adding another barrier to life.This lack of circulation gives the Dragon Hole an unusual quality. Water layers remain largely undisturbed, holding chemical signals that reflect past ocean conditions. For scientists, this isolation is valuable. It offers a way to read changes that unfolded slowly, without constant mixing or disruption.","The Sansha Yongle Blue Hole, also known as the Dragon Hole, sits in the South China Sea and has drawn scientific attention for more than a decade.
