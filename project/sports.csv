There needs to be better communication all around. All must be on the same page.""Even though head coach Gautam Gambhir indicated that Bumrah wouldn't be rested, a BCCI statement on the morning of the match announced, ""Mr Jasprit Bumrah has not fully recovered from his viral illness and was unavailable for the third Test in Mumbai.""In the two Tests he played, Bumrah took just three wickets at an average of 42.33 across 41 overs.

He forged a crucial 94-run partnership for the sixth wicket with Nitish Reddy, who contributed 38 runs, stabilizing India A's innings.Jurel's back-to-back fifties have been a timely reminder of his excellent form ahead of the highly anticipated Border-Gavaskar Trophy , set to commence on November 22.

In the dying moments of the match, Jharkhand defender Sem Munda suffered an injury while blocking a penalty corner and was forced to leave the field. His absence hurt his team badly, at a time when they needed his presence the most.

Cowboys consider Trey Lance for potential QB role amid Dak Prescott's absence



Dallas Cowboys' quarterback Dak Prescott's recent injury has cast a long shadow over the team's playoff hopes. With a 3-5 record, the Cowboys are trailing the Green Bay Packers by 2.5 games for the NFC's final wild-card spot. As Prescott is sidelined, the team is turning to Cooper Rush to lead the offense. However, the spotlight might soon shift to Trey Lance, the former No. 3 overall pick.Also Read: ""I‚Äôm just a big fan"": Vikings Coach Kevin O'Connell reflects on Colts QB Anthony Richardson's benching and the supportive gesture that went viral During a recent discussion on ‚Äú105.3 The Fan,‚Äù Cowboys owner Jerry Jones elaborated on his thoughts regarding the quarterback situation following Prescott‚Äôs injury. Jones expressed confidence in Rush‚Äôs adaptability, noting, ""I think we can run anything that Dak runs with him."" This highlights the Cowboys‚Äô plan to adjust smoothly without their primary QB. However, when asked about Lance, Jones hinted at more versatile options. ""There is a window for Trey Lance. There are packages we can work on‚Ä¶ He's a big threat with his legs,"" Jones explained. The plan, it seems, isn‚Äôt merely to put Lance on the field but to leverage his athleticism to elevate the Cowboys' offensive strategy.Given Dallas‚Äô current standing, incorporating Lance‚Äîif even in a limited, ‚Äúgadget‚Äù role‚Äîcould be a strategic boost. Should Rush falter, Lance‚Äôs rushing ability offers the Cowboys an alternative that might reinvigorate their season. Lance himself has shown a positive attitude about the situation. Though he hasn‚Äôt seen regular-season action in over two years, the 2021 No. 3 overall pick remains ready. His time working with coaches and teammates has prepared him for any opportunity that arises, as he noted, ‚Äúgreat coaches, great guys around me ‚Äî I feel prepared if that opportunity does happen at some point.‚ÄùWhile it's uncertain when or how extensively Lance will feature, his potential as a playmaker adds depth to the Cowboys‚Äô lineup.

However, Rathod didn‚Äôt allow Himachal bowlers to cash in on the twin blows.Going into a shell, considering the match situation, wasn‚Äôt totally uncalled for.

Christian McCaffrey feels 'Great' ahead of 49ers season debut



Christian McCaffrey is set to make his much-anticipated return to the field for the San Francisco 49ers . After a lengthy recovery from bilateral Achilles tendinitis that sidelined him for the first eight games of the season, the All-Pro running back is on track to make his season debut this Sunday against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers .Also Read: ""I‚Äôm just a big fan"": Vikings Coach Kevin O'Connell reflects on Colts QB Anthony Richardson's benching and the supportive gesture that went viral McCaffrey, who missed the first eight games due to bilateral Achilles tendinitis, completed his first full week of practice since the preseason, positioning him for activation from injured reserve in time for the weekend.Though listed as questionable on the injury report, head coach Kyle Shanahan clarified that a substantial setback would be required to prevent McCaffrey‚Äôs return. Shanahan expressed confidence that the running back will be removed from IR on Saturday, saying, ‚ÄúUnless something crazy happens on this plane ride, he should be good to go once he gets off IR.‚Äù McCaffrey‚Äôs return is highly anticipated, particularly as the 49ers aim to boost their season after a mixed 4-4 start.Reflecting on his time away from the field, McCaffrey described a challenging period both mentally and physically, saying he was in a ‚Äúdark‚Äù place during his eight-week recovery. The star running back explained the toll of being sidelined, sharing, ‚ÄúSometimes you just take it for granted that you play this game for a living...but when it‚Äôs taken from you, even just for a little bit of time, it makes you really appreciate every single day when you‚Äôre on the grass.‚Äù This sentiment highlights the gratitude he has gained for each moment on the field, especially after months of strenuous rehabilitation.McCaffrey‚Äôs Achilles injury initially surfaced in August, leading to his limited involvement in training camp and, ultimately, his absence from the season‚Äôs opening game. A brief practice return was cut short by a recurrence of symptoms, forcing him onto injured reserve by mid-September. Throughout the past seven weeks, McCaffrey concentrated on healing, including a trip to Germany for specialized treatment. His dedication to recovery has equipped him for a highly anticipated return, as the 49ers are eager to leverage his talent for a potential second-half comeback.McCaffrey‚Äôs likely return this Sunday promises to energize the team, who have persevered through his absence. As the 49ers prepare to face the Buccaneers, fans and teammates alike are hopeful that his re-entry will spark the surge needed to revitalize their season.Also Read: ""He's a big threat with his legs"": Amid Dak Prescott‚Äôs absence, Jerry Jones clarifies how Trey Lance will fit into Cowboys‚Äô offense",Christian McCaffrey is set to make his much-anticipated return to the field for the San Francisco 49ers.

üî¥ LIVE: India refuse to travel to Pakistan for Champions Trophy, want matches in Dubai | BTB Live

NEW DELHI: The uncertainty over Team India's travel to Pakistan for the upcoming ICC Champions Trophy in February next year continues.Reports emerged Friday that BCCI had informed Pakistan Cricket Board that it won't send the Indian team to Pakistan for the tournament. TOI understands BCCI has conveyed its wish to play its matches in Dubai. But PCB chief Mohsin Naqvi denied receiving any formal communication from BCCI.ICC has set no deadline for declaring the tournament fixtures. ICC usually tries to announce these details at least three months in advance. BCCI had delayed announcing the ODI World Cup fixtures last year after PCB objected to playing in Ahmedabad.As per standard practice, BCCI must obtain clearance from the Indian govt before taking any call on team's travel to Pakistan.""BCCI's stance remains unaltered. The board doesn't take any call without the govt's nod. It has been communicated to PCB that the Indian team is unlikely to travel to Pakistan,"" a BCCI source told TOI on Friday.Minister of External Affairs S Jaishankar's recent visit to Pakistan had raised hopes in cricketing circles that India might agree to play in Pakistan.It is learnt that the board decided on Dubai after talking to the Indian team management. ""If India play their matches in Dubai, it will be convenient for PCB to host the matches there. It's a short flight from Pakistan to Dubai and other teams will not be averse to the idea,"" the source added.""Till today, no one has discussed any hybrid model with us nor are we willing to talk about it. But we have been showing good gestures for the last few years and no one should expect us to do it all the time,"" Naqvi told reporters in Lahore on Friday evening.PCB had agreed on a hybrid model while hosting the Asia Cup in 2023 with India playing all their matches in Sri Lanka. Pakistan had eventually agreed to play India in Ahmedabad during the ODI World Cup as well.As things stand, if things don't change on BCCI's front, PCB will have to take the matter to the ICC where incumbent BCCI secretary Jay Shah , who assumes office as chairman of the ICC on Dec 1, will have to take a decision on the issue. As per policy, ICC doesn't interfere in any country's diplomatic policies.Sources said BCCI wants the decision on this issue to be taken before Shah takes charge as ICC's chairman.If PCB eventually agrees to the hybrid model, it will be interesting to see which venue ICC suggests for the final. ""Ideally, the final should be played in Dubai. One should not have an ambiguous venue for the final. Other teams also must know in advance where the final of such an important tournament will be played,"" said the source.PCB had reportedly floated the idea of Indian team setting up a base in Chandigarh and travelling to Lahore only on match days. However, that idea is deemed as a logistical nightmare.",BCCI tells Pakistan Cricket Board that it won't send Indian team to Pakistan for the tournament.

All the players in the team are between the age of 18 to 24 and are from poor background. The players stay in different islands and to get them together is difficult. They have the craze to play hockey and if they have the right infrastructure, probably they will get better,"" coach Sahu Surju, who is a hockey player and is pursuing a master‚Äôs degree in physical education, said.Andaman & Nicobar lost by huge margins (0-29 to Madhya Pradesh, 0-13 to Andhra Pradesh and now 0-43 to TN) in all the three matches that they played. When asked how the players feel mentally losing badly, the coach said: ""They are still maturing as they are very young. Many do not have exposure. We had requested Hockey India (HI) to lay an astro-turf earlier and from now, we will push hard to get proper facilities.""Apart from Andaman and Nicobar, many teams in the ongoing Nationals have lost their respective matches by huge margins. There is a marked difference in the skill set of the players. So, could bringing in zonal or division format raise the level of competition?""I think the teams that play in the Nationals should be good. You are basically humiliating the state that has conceded more goals. Probably they can play in the zonal format and the top teams can qualify for the nationals,"" Madhya Pradesh manager and former India coach Mir Ranjan Negi said.Meanwhile, Telangana coach Kiran Prasad added: ""This is the time (in Nationals) players compete with the top teams and by bringing in zonals or divisions, they could miss on playing against the best players in the country. Players might not get government jobs if they fail to qualify for the nationals from the zonal or division formats.""",Tamil Nadu beat Andaman and Nicobar Islands 43-0 to make last-eight stage.

The writing on the wall was clear on Day 2 itself. And the Day 3 proceedings unfolded on the expected lines as Jharkhand conceded the first-innings lead to Saurashtra in their Ranji Trophy match of Elite Group D at JSCA International Stadium in Ranchi on Friday.Resuming on 201/4, Saurashtra batters Harvik Desai and Arpit Vasavada proceeded from their overnight position on Day 2 to amass 386, establishing a substantial 80-run first-innings lead. Both exhibited measured batting whilst Jharkhand bowlers toiled hard from the outset.Having conceded the first-innings lead, Jharkhand progressed to 74/1 from 20 overs in their second innings, trailing Saurashtra by 6 runs going into the final day of the four-day game.Earlier, Desai achieved his seventh first-class century whilst seasoned campaigner Vasavada registered his 28th half-century as the pair constructed a 199-run partnership for the fifth wicket to bolster Saurashtra‚Äôs robust response.Vasavada (73 off 169 balls, 7 fours) departed on the final delivery before lunch with the scoreboard displaying 314/5. Desai followed shortly after lunch, crafting 155 off 263 deliveries, studded with 23 fours.Excluding Prerak Mankad‚Äôs 56-ball 40, the remaining lower middle order batters failed to produce noteworthy contributions as Saurashtra surrendered their final three wickets without adding runs, culminating at 386.Jharkhand left-arm spinner Manishi claimed 3/75 whilst his senior spin colleague Anukul Roy secured 2/33. Medium pacers Vikas Kumar took 3/74, including Vasavada‚Äôs wicket, whilst Vivekanand Tiwari acquired 2/80.Openers Nazim Siddiquie (32) and Saharandeep Singh (26 batting) provided the hosts with a solid foundation until the former was run out towards the day‚Äôs end. Sharandeep and Utkarsh Singh (10 batting) remain unbeaten at the crease.Much will depend on the home side batters as Jharkhand look to thwart any push by the former champions for an outright win on the last day. As for Saurashtra, they can give their faltering season a timely boost if they manage to eke out a remarkable win here.

Match to continue

The Bihar batters put up a show of grit in their bid to outperform Madhya Pradesh‚Äôs mammoth first innings total. But their fightback looks headed towards being futile as with 331 on board at stumps on Day 3 of their Elite Group C Ranji Trophy match in Patna on Friday, they were still trailing by 285 runs and with two wickets in hand.Earlier, on Thursday, Madhya Pradesh had managed to put up a huge score on Day 2 and ended their first innings on 616 while riding a match-influencing double century by skipper Shubham Sharma . Sharma led from the front with a strike rate of 83.04 as Venkatesh Iyer missed his double by a small margin and was leg before to Himangshu Sharma (5-196), the most impressive of the Bihar bowlers, follwed by Sachin Kumar (4-211).However, coming back to the filed on Friday on an overnight score of 131/4, Bipin Saurabh (71) and Ayush Loharuka (76) took up the challenge with perseverance. They added 96 runs off 186 balls for the fifth wicket and when Saurabh ws stumped by Himanshu Mantri off a Saransh Jain delivery, Bihar had crossed the 200 mark.The onus was shifted to Sharam Nigrodh (42) to join Loharuka in the middle and keep his team on course for the huge task ahead. Nigrodh and Loharuka then added another 86 runs with their sixth-wicket partnership as the visiting Madhya Pradesh bowlers made them work for every run.Bihar No. 8 batter, Sachin Kumar, too, played his part with a useful 34 runs to the hosts‚Äô total.But Bihar lacked an incredible knock ‚Äî like that of Sharma and Iyer on Day 2 ‚Äî as none from the home team could breach the three-figure mark with their bats and were on 331/8 when play was called off for the day.Jain, meanwhile, was the most successful among the visiting bowlers on Friday with his figures of 3-107 as Aryan Pandey and Kumar Kartikeya picked two wickets each to keep Madhya Paradesh on the path to first-innings lead and three points.Brief scores (in Patna):616.331/8 in 130.5 overs (Ayush Loharuka 76, Bipin Saurabh 71, Sharman Nigrodh 42; Saransh Jain 3/107).",Bihar batters put up a show of grit in their bid to outperform Madhya Pradesh‚Äôs mammoth first innings total.

The amount of hard work that he has put in over the last few years, doing those boring things again and again, he is reaping the fruits (now). He is putting the team first, even when he was in the 90s, he was looking to hit fours and sixes. That is what separates him,"" Surya said in the post-match presentation.India's victory at Kingsmead extended their winning streak in Durban, a fact unbeknownst to the Indian captain. The team has now won 4 out of 6 matches at the venue with one no result and a tied game.‚ÄúIs it? I did not know about that. I just got to know now. We have not changed our brand of cricket in the last 3-4 series, very happy with the win,‚Äù Surya saidDespite the comfortable win, the match had its tense moments when David Miller and Heinrich Klaasen were at the crease. The duo, known for their destructive batting, posed a potential threat to India.Surya's decision to introduce Varun Chakaravarthy in the 12th over proved decisive. Varun dismissed both Miller and Klaasen in a single over, heavily tilting the game in India's favor.The twin-breakthrough then allowed Ravi Bishnoi to capitalize from the other end as he claimed a three-for, dismantling South Africa's batting lineup.""I wanted to pick crucial wickets at the time, and it was important to get them (Klaasen and Miller) out. With the ground and the wind, they are dangerous and the way they (Bishnoi and Chakravarthy) delivered, it was great. Really enjoying (captaincy). The boys are making things easier (for me). The way they have been showing that fearless attitude, enjoying each other's company, on and off the field, it makes my job very easy,"" Surya said.",Suryakumar Yadav hails Sanju Samson's character and work ethic.

Brief scores (In Guwahati):

Collectively not up to the mark till the last game, Assam batters fired in unison ‚Äì that, too, against the heavyweights Tamil Nadu ‚Äì to secure the crucial first-innings lead in a Ranji Trophy match in Guwahati on Friday.In an enthralling Elite Group D encounter at Barsapara Cricket Stadium, resuming their innings on 176/3, Assam showcased a remarkable batting display on the penultimate day to post a formidable total of 445 from 146.2 overs, thereby overtaking Tamil Nadu‚Äôs first-innings score of 338. This effort handed Assam a crucial lead of 107 runs, securing three vital points from the game.The highlights of the day were Assam captain Denish Das, who led his team from the front, and veteran Swarupam Purakayastha‚Äôs performance with the bat.Completing his century on the morning of Day 3, Das was a spectacle, scoring 109 off 195 balls, including 14 boundaries, before losing his stumps to the right-arm off-spinner Mohamed Ali. His partnership with Sibsankar Roy, who played the anchor‚Äôs role with a patient 69 off 208 balls, was particularly noteworthy.Their overnight unbeaten partnership fetched 173 runs for the fourth wicket, laying the foundation for Assam‚Äôs commanding first-innings reply. Despite a minor hiccup when keeper-batter Sumit Ghadigaonkar failed to convert his start, returning on 20, Assam lower-middle order showed resilience.Purakayastha, coming in at No. 7, found an able partner in Mukhtar Hussain at No. 8. Together, they put on an 89-run stand, helping Assam not only surpass Tamil Nadu‚Äôs tally with ease but also secure a sizeable 107-run lead over their esteemed visitors.Purakayastha‚Äôs steady knock of 90 off 131 balls, adorned with 10 fours and three sixes, was a treat to watch. Although he missed a well-deserved century, which could have been his third first-class ton, his performance with both bat and ball was commendable. Hussain contributed a valuable 35 off 77 balls, and by the time he departed, Assam was comfortably placed at 412/7. The innings, however, folded quickly after Purakayastha‚Äôs departure.As the match heads into the final day, Tamil Nadu, batting in their second innings, are on 8 without loss after 4 overs, trailing Assam by 99 runs.

BENGALURU: Bengaluru FC have been the standout team in the Indian Super League this season. If their attack found goals at crucial junctures, their defence has been right up there, conceding just four goals to help them stay at the top of the table with 16 points. Even though the Blues suffered a 0-3 loss to FC Goa on Saturday, they are upbeat about their next fixture against an in-form NorthEast United FC at the Sree Kanteerava Stadium here on Friday.In fact, their defence has not been breached even once (in four matches) at home with senior players Rahul Bheke and goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu , who is one away from collecting a record 50 clean sheets in the competition, bringing their experience into play. The duo will have to be on their toes against a team, which is not short on confidence either.The Highlanders have scored 17 goals -- highest in the league this season. Moroccan forward Alaaeddine Ajaraie has contributed nine of those, including two each in their last two matches against Odisha FC and Jamshedpur FC. NorthEast, who have scored ten goals in their last three matches, have scored at least once in all their seven games, showcasing their attacking prowess.No wonder, Bengaluru head coach Gerard Zaragoza has billed the contest as BFC defence vs NorthEast attack. ‚ÄúOf course, we have a plan (against their strikers). They have strikers who score every game. But also, we need to remember that we are the team with more clean sheets. We have the best defensive team in the league. And I think it will be a nice game to see one with very good attack against one with very good defence.‚ÄùThe Blues' defence cannot alone win games, players up front have to be clinical in front of goal. Bengaluru attackers, including Sunil Chhetri , Edgar Mendez and others must come to the Fortress with their scoring boots on and they will be even more determined after drawing a blank against Goa. If they get back to their winning ways, Bengaluru can strengthen their position at the top and increase their lead to six points. Likewise, three points for Highlanders will rocket them to second spot. With big points at stake for both teams, a close contest is on the cards.","Bengaluru FC face an in-form NorthEast United FC at the Sree Kanteerava Stadium.

Both teams are doing well in Europe.""Galatasaray took an early lead when Yunus Akgun smashed a sensational long-range volley into the top corner in the sixth minute.But the visitors hit back just 12 minutes later as teenage striker Will Lankshear marked just his second first-team appearance with a goal by tapping in Brennan Johnson's pass across the six-yard box.Galatasaray took control before half-time, though, as Osimhen scored twice in the space of eight minutes.The Nigerian star fired them back in front just after the half-hour mark, before cleverly volleying Dries Mertens' cross past Tottenham goalkeeper Fraser Forster.Osimhen has now scored six goals in eight appearances for Galatasaray since joining on loan from Napoli.The home side passed up several opportunities to put the game out of sight for their opponents, but Spurs' hopes of a comeback were hit when Lankshear was sent off for two yellow-card offences in quick succession in the second half.Dominic Solanke pulled one back in the 69th minute, shortly after being brought on by Postecoglou, but Galatasaray held on with relative comfort.Amad Diallo, often overlooked by former boss Erik ten Hag, scored twice as Man United beat PAOK 2-0 at Old Trafford in their first Europa League game since sacking the Dutchman.The Ivorian winger put United ahead early in the second half with a header across goal that bounced in at the far post.Diallo secured the hosts a much-needed three points, after three previous draws, with 13 minutes remaining with a wonderful individual effort.""He (Diallo) has been incredible in training, he always trains well and is asking me to do more,"" interim manager Ruud van Nistelrooy told TNT Sports.Van Nistelrooy's next and final game in charge will be the Premier League visit of Leicester this weekend, before Ruben Amorim takes over after the international break.""Sunday is another one and I'm so focused on doing that so I'm not thinking of what is next.""Lazio are the only team with four wins from four games after Pedro scored an injury-time winner in a 2-1 success against Porto.Alessio Romagnoli gave the Romans the lead on the stroke of half-time, before Stephen Eustaquio levelled for Porto.Ajax sit in second place, two points behind Lazio, after romping to a 5-0 thrashing of Maccabi Tel Aviv.Omar Marmoush's 13th goal of the season clinched Eintracht Frankfurt, who are fourth behind Galatasaray on goals scored, a 1-0 win against Slavia Prague.The Egyptian clipped a superb free-kick in off the crossbar shortly after the break.Athletic Bilbao came from behind to grab a 2-1 success at Ludogorets.Inaki Williams and Nico Serrano both scored in a two-minute burst from the Basque club.Roma's disappointing form this season continued as Kevin Mac Allister's goal 13 minutes from time secured Union Saint-Gilloise their second point of the competition with a 1-1 draw in Belgium.Elsewhere, Rangers held Olympiakos to a 1-1 stalemate in Greece, while Hoffenheim and Lyon both scored deep into added time in a dramatic 2-2 draw.In the Conference League, a much-changed Chelsea romped to an 8-0 thrashing of Armenians Noah at Stamford Bridge.Joao Felix and Christopher Nkunku both netted doubles for the Blues, with Mykhailo Mudryk, Axel Disasi, Marc Guiu and Tosin Adarabioyo all also on the scoresheet.","Victor Osimhen scores twice as Galatasaray inflict first Europa League defeat of the season on Tottenham.

The ball fell to Dries Mertens who slipped a pass to Osimhen and the Nigerian striker found the bottom corner.Osimhen struck again six minutes from the break and Lankshear received his second booking on the hour mark, but 10-man Tottenham pulled a goal back when substitute Dominic Solanke back-heeled Pedro Porro's cross into the net.Lazio made it four wins from four to take control at the top of the standings thanks to an added-time goal from Pedro.The Italian side went ahead at the end of the first half through Alessio Romagnoli's header but Porto drew level through Stephen Eustaquio.It looked like Lazio would have to settle for a draw but with time running out Pedro turned a cross from Gustav Isaksen into the net.Anderlecht could have joined them on 12 points, with Mario Stroeykens putting them ahead five minutes from time but RFS snatched a draw deep into added time when Moussa N'diaye put the ball into his own net.Bilbao moved on to 10 points with their comeback win in Bulgaria against Ludogorets after Inaki Williams and Nicolas Serrano scored second-half goals in quick succession.Ajax are also on 10 after cruising to victory over Maccabi with goals from Bertrand Traore, Kenneth Taylor, Mika Godts, Brian Brobbey and Kian Fitz-Jim.Eintracht Frankfurt overcame Slavia Prague 1-0 thanks to Omar Marmoush's goal direct from a free kick and they remain two points behind Lazio.AS Roma were held to a 1-1 draw at Union Saint-Gilloise where Gianluca Mancini put the Italians ahead before Kevin MacAllister equalised for the Belgian side, which leaves the Italians down in 20th on five points.","Manchester United earn first Europa League win with 2-0 win over PAOK.

Instead, he visited Stockholm with his associates for a brief holiday.Following his Swedish visit, local media outlets reported an investigation into alleged rape charges. Mbappe dismissed these reports as ""fake news"", while his legal representative announced intentions to pursue libel action.A Swedish prosecutor verified that an investigation was underway, though Mbappe's name was not specifically mentioned.Subsequently, the former Paris Saint-Germain striker has participated in four matches for his club, scoring once.

Al Ain have parted ways with head coach Hernan Crespo , just six months after celebrating an AFC Champions League title . The decision follows a string of disappointing results, culminating in a heavy 5-1 defeat to Cristiano Ronaldo 's Al Nassr in the Asian Champions League group stage.‚ÄúRecent results have not been up to expectations,‚Äù explained the club in an official statement released on Wednesday.Al Ain confirmed that a replacement for Crespo will be announced soon.Crespo, a former Argentine international striker known for his time at clubs like Chelsea and Inter Milan, joined Al Ain in November 2022. He quickly made an impact, leading the team to victory in the AFC Champions League this past May after defeating Japan's Yokohama F. Marinos in the final.However, the team's form dipped significantly starting in late September, with the loss to Al Nassr proving to be the final straw for Crespo's tenure. Ronaldo himself was among the scorers in the lopsided match, a result that leaves the defending champions at the bottom of their group with a single point from four matches.Al Ain's domestic campaign in the UAE Pro League has also been challenging. They currently sit in eighth place in the 14-team league, having earned just eight points from five matches. This puts them ten points behind league leaders Shabab Al Ahli.The search for a new manager is already underway as Al Ain aims to turn around their season both domestically and in the prestigious Asian Champions League.","Al Ain have parted ways with head coach Hernan Crespo.

Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz are set to further their emerging rivalry when the ATP Finals commence on Sunday, marking the first time in 23 years that the event will be held without any of the Big Three.Sinner, the top-ranked player, and No. 3 Alcaraz each claimed two Grand Slam titles this year, so a matchup between them in Turin would be fitting.In the draw on Thursday , Sinner and Alcaraz were placed in separate groups. Sinner will compete in the Ilie Nastase Group alongside Daniil Medvedev, Taylor Fritz, and Alex de Minaur, while Alcaraz will be in the John Newcombe Group with Alexander Zverev, Casper Ruud, and Andrey Rublev. The top two players from each group will advance to the semifinals following the round-robin stage.After withdrawing from last week's Paris Masters due to illness, Sinner arrived in Turin early to prepare. ‚ÄúFor me, this is the main event of the end of the year,‚Äù he stated.Notably absent is defending champion Novak Djokovic, who withdrew on Tuesday due to an unspecified injury . This is the first year since 2001 that the finals will occur without at least one of Djokovic, Roger Federer, or Rafael Nadal. Additionally, this season also marks the first time since 2002 that no member of that trio has won a Grand Slam title.Djokovic holds the record for the most ATP Finals victories, having won seven times and defeating Sinner in the final last year. Federer, who retired in 2022, won the event six times, while Nadal, who will retire after the Davis Cup next week, was a finalist twice but never secured a title.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs strange not to see Novak here, given all his success,‚Äù Zverev remarked. ‚ÄúWhen I won in 2018, you needed to defeat at least two of the top three players. It feels different now. But with Jannik and Carlos emerging, the focus has shifted to new talent. You have to overcome them to win big tournaments. They've both won two Grand Slams this year and undoubtedly rank among the best players in the world.‚ÄùAs the sole Italian in the competition, Sinner will attract significant attention, particularly since this is his first home appearance following the announcement of positive drug tests earlier this year before his US Open title.The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) appealed a decision exonerating Sinner, and the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) is expected to issue a ruling early next year. Sinner expressed uncertainty over updates, emphasising his positive outlook despite the challenging circumstance.Alcaraz has defeated Sinner in all three of their official meetings this year and currently leads their overall head-to-head 6-4.Sinner's year started with an Australian Open victory ‚Äî the first Grand Slam title for an Italian man since Adriano Panatta's 1976 French Open win. Alcaraz subsequently secured the French Open and Wimbledon titles, bringing his career total to four Grand Slams. Sinner later triumphed at the US Open. Notably, Sinner defeated Alcaraz during the Six Kings Slam exhibition in Saudi Arabia last month.Zverev, who has previously won the finals in London in 2018 and in Turin in 2021, seeks to claim his third title. Medvedev, the only other player in the field with a finals win, lifted the trophy in 2020.Zverev arrives in promising form following a title victory at the Paris Masters , which propelled him past Alcaraz to No. 2 in the rankings.Fritz aims to build on his maiden Grand Slam final appearance in New York, Ruud was a finalist in 2022, De Minaur is making his debut in the tournament, and Rublev is competing for the fifth consecutive year.The ATP Finals, featuring the top eight singles players and doubles teams, begins on November 10 and runs until November 17.The ATP Finals will be contested in Turin, Italy for the fourth consecutive year. The event will take place at the Inalpi Arena.Ilie Nastase Group: Jannik Sinner (1), Daniil Medvedev (4), Taylor Fritz (5), Alex de Minaur (7)John Newcombe Group: Alexander Zverev (2), Carlos Alcaraz (3), Casper Ruud (6), Andrey Rublev (8)Bob Bryan Group: Marcelo Arevalo and Mate Pavic (1), Simone Bolelli and Andrea Vavassori (4), Rohan Bopanna and Matthew Ebden (6), Kevin Krawietz and Tim Puetz (8)zverevMike Bryan Group: Marcel Granollers and Horacio Zeballos (2), Wesley Koolhof and Nikola Mektic (3), Max Purcell and Jordan Thompson (5), Harri Heliovaara and Henry Patten (7)The champion of the ATP Finals will receive $4.8 million, the largest prize in men‚Äôs tennis history. This amount surpasses the earnings from Sinner and Alcaraz‚Äôs Grand Slam victories this year, with Sinner earning $3.6 million for the US Open and Alcaraz $3.45 million (or ¬£2.7 million) for Wimbledon.The singles and doubles competitions will take place in a round-robin format. The players and teams will play each other(s) once and the top two in singles/doubles will advance to the semi-finals.
