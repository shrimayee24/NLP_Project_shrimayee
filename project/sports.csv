Pls remember that social media is not real, and 5 seconds is not enough to understand a situation. You also never know what a person can handle mentally. Thank you baby for always trying to cheer me up. You truly are the greatest partner a girl could ever ask for.""But fans were still irked by Leanna’s reaction on the field and many thought that even though Travis performed so well on the field, Leanna took away all the spotlight from him.Travis also defended Leanna saying people are too invested in their relationship and no one needs to worry about them.

It was not just his home that was burglarised; his teammate and a close friend of his, Patrick Mahomes’ house was also burglarised just a few days later. Since then two more players’ in the NFL have been victims of such burglaries, this also includes the quarterback of the Cincinnati Bengals, Joe Burrow who recently suffered a home break in.Before this incident, as per many reports, a source close to Taylor and Travis had revealed that Taylor was pretty scared after one of her concerts in Vienna had to be cancelled because of a potential terror attack and now she only feels safe when she is with her boyfriend, the NFL star Travis. This also makes sense because now Taylor, who skips away games of the Kansas City Chiefs, is now planning to stay with Travis at his home that was burglarised just recently.Since Travis’ home was burglarised, according to various reports, Travis has put in extra effort to secure his home’s security especially so that Taylor can be at his home in peace. It seems like the burglary and the terror threat to Taylor’s concert has really shaken up the couple. Travis has used modern amenities to secure his home so that an incident like this does not repeat itself and Taylor as well as her belongings are all safe at Travis’ home.Also Read: Taylor Swift decides to miss the Browns game over safety concerns, continuing to attend Travis Kelce’s home games As per reports, Travis had reported valuables worth $100K were stolen from his house.

NEW DELHI: The fifth day of the third Test between India and Australia in the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy at The Gabba in Brisbane got underway on schedule.The day's proceedings started with Australia captain Pat Cummins completing his unfinished over from Day 4. Only 4.5 overs were possible after that as India were bowled out for 260 runs in their first innings and Australia's second innings was delayed due to lightning and rain. Jasprit Bumrah and Akash Deep , who had starred for India in avoiding the follow-on on Day 4, put up a defiant 47-run stand for the last wicket.But a funny moment came in Nathan Lyon 's second over of the day when Akash Deep played on a delivery on to his pads and the ball stuck there.Travis Head , fielding at forward short leg, came forward to collect the ball from Akash Deep who had taken it out from his pads.But Akash Deep just dropped the ball on the ground in front of Head leaving the Aussie puzzled and irritated at the same time.Akash Deep, realizing his mistake, then said ""sorry sorry"" to invoke a laugh not only from the commentators but also a wry smile from Head.In the next over, Head had Akash Deep stumped by Alex Carey as Australia took a 185-run lead.",The fifth day of the third Test between India and Australia at The Gabba in Brisbane got underway on schedule.

EXPLAINED: What's the '30:30 rule' in cricket for lightning and thunder stopping play,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-in-australia/explained-whats-the-3030-rule-in-cricket-for-lightning-and-thunder-stopping-play/articleshow/116417768.cms,"KL Rahul Press Conference

The third Test between India and Australia at the Gabba in Brisbane continued to be affected by rain, but it was lightning and thunder that forced play to be suspended on Wednesday before rain arrived on the final morning of the match.It took Australia just eight balls to snare the last Indian wicket after the pair of Jasprit Bumrah (10*) and Akash Deep (31) frustrated them on Tuesday evening with their last-wicket partnership that helped India save the follow-on.Travis Head dismissed Akash with his off-spin to end the partnership of 47 runs and wrap up India's first innings at 260, which gave Australia a lead of 185 runs. But with India saving the follow-on and rain washing out the remainder of the first session, the game is on its way to end in a draw.The Indian team was ready to come out and bowl, but they were asked to go back after a flash of lightning appeared in the dark skies.It's not often that lightning and thunder force the umpires to stop play, but rules have been put in place by the International Cricket Council if there is a threat of a lightning-strike.Former international umpire Simon Taufel explained that on the Channel 7 broadcast for the knowledge of the fans.""The ICC have had a lightning protocol in place for a number of years now, probably five to six years. It's a 30:30 rule,"" said Taufel.""So when there's an imminent threat of lightning and the umpires see a flash of lightning, if they hear a thunder clap within 30 seconds, that's the guideline for them to suspend play or not play at all.""Obviously there's a degree of common sense here that if the storm is moving away, and that 30 seconds is getting close, they can agree to restart play or keep playing,"" he added.Taufel further said that in case of this particular instance at the Gabba on Wednesday, the lightning appeared close and was threatening.""In this particular case, with lightning so close, there is an imminent threat; and when they see a flash of lightning and a clap of thunder within 30 seconds, they will suspend and abandon play because it is about the safety of everyone, spectators included, ground staff and everyone at the ground.""The five-Test Border Gavaskar Trophy series is currently level at 1-1, with India winning the first Test in Perth by 295 runs and Australia coming back with a 10-wicket victory at the Adelaide Oval.The third Test will begin on Boxing Day, December 26, at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.","Third Test between India and Australia at the Gabba in Brisbane continued to be affected by rain, but it was lightning and thunder that forced play to be suspended on Wednesday.

Explained: How follow-on rule works in Test cricket,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-in-australia/explained-how-follow-on-rule-works-in-test-cricket/articleshow/116396488.cms,"Jasprit Bumrah and Akash Deep. (Pic Credit - X)

We as a team are going through transition: Jasprit Bumrah

This rule is governed by Law 14 of the

MCC Laws of Cricket

:

14.1 Lead on first innings

14.1.1 In a two-innings match of 5 days or more, the side which bats first and leads by at least 200 runs shall have the option of requiring the other side to follow their innings.

14.1.2 The same option shall be available in two-innings matches of shorter duration with the minimum leads as follows:

- 150 runs in a match of 3 or 4 days

- 100 runs in a 2-day match

- 75 runs in a 1-day match

14.2 Notification

A captain shall notify the opposing captain and the umpires of his/her intention to take up this option. Once notified, the decision cannot be changed.

The follow-on rule is basically used to enforce a batting team's second innings immediately after their first innings in Test cricket if they fail to score a minimum threshold in comparison to the opponent's first innings total.The follow-on is applied in matches spanning five days or more. If Team A bats first and posts a significant total, Team B must score within 200 runs of Team A's total to avoid the follow-on.For instance, if Team A scores 500, Team B must score at least 301 to make Team A bat again. If they score 300 or fewer, Team A’s captain can opt to enforce the follow-on.By enforcing the follow-on, Team A makes Team B bat their second innings immediately, skipping Team A's second innings. This strategy is often employed when time is limited or when the pitch is deteriorating, giving Team A a better chance of winning.The decision to enforce the follow-on rests solely with the fielding captain, making it a strategic choice based on match conditions.In the third Test against Australia in Brisbane on Tuesday, the final wicket partnership between Jasprit Bumrah and Akash Deep proved crucial on Day 4, helping India avoid the follow-on and reach 252/9 in 74.5 overs at stumps.India faced a challenging situation in the last session after Ravindra Jadeja's dismissal for 77, with the team still needing 33 runs to avoid the follow-on.Akash joined Bumrah at the crease, and together they constructed an invaluable unbeaten 39-run stand from 51 deliveries, causing frustration for the Australian side on a day affected by rain.At the close of play, which came early due to poor light, Akash remained not out on 27 from 31 balls, while Bumrah was unbeaten on 10. India still trail Australia's first innings total of 445 by 193 runs, with Wednesday's weather conditions likely to influence the match outcome.","The follow-on is applied in matches spanning five days or more. If Team A bats first and posts a significant total, Team B must score within 200 runs of Team A's total to avoid the following day's play. Team A makes Team B bat their second innings immediately, skipping Team B's second innings.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116396454,imgsize-115408,width-400,resizemode-4/116396454.jpg"

Eagles soar, Steelers face challenges ahead



Mike Tomlin challenged the refs, while Russell Wilson stayed quiet

Sunday’s Steelers vs. Eagles game set the stage for a new chapter in the NFL. Jalen Hurts and Russell Wilson faced off, symbolizing a passing of the torch from one generation to the next. While Hurts commanded the field with poise, the Steelers struggled to find their rhythm, especially in the second half. With the Eagles securing another win, their Super Bowl aspirations grow stronger, while Pittsburgh heads back to the drawing board, facing a crucial path ahead. The road ahead is clear: the Eagles are on the rise, and the Steelers must regroup for what’s next.Sunday's showdown between the Steelers and Eagles wasn’t just about the scoreboard, it was about a moment that captured the heart of football. While Pittsburgh took the loss, Jalen Hurts delivered a victory for respect, telling Russell Wilson, “I watched you growing up. You paved the way.” Classy, heartfelt, and now viral.Wilson, ever the veteran, didn’t let it slide. He reposted the clip on Instagram with a simple yet powerful reply: “Respect, young king. @jalenhurts.” It wasn’t just words; it felt like a torch being passed from one great to the next.On the field, the contrast was stark. Wilson struggled with just 128 passing yards and a single touchdown, while Hurts showed why he’s the Eagles' franchise leader. Throwing for 290 yards and two touchdowns, he commanded the game with a calm confidence that screamed, This is my moment.Philly’s dominant 27-13 win wasn’t just another game, it was a message. With their 10th straight victory, the 12-1 Eagles look every bit likeSuper Bowl contenders . For Pittsburgh, though, it was a tough pill to swallow. No second-half points and frustration boiling over, even for Mike Tomlin , who took aim at officiating post-game.Two teams, two paths. For Philly, it’s all about the climb. For the Steelers, it’s back to the drawing board. Football’s a grind, but it’s moments like these that remind us why we love the game.Sunday’s Steelers vs. Eagles game was a story of contrasts. Two halves. Two quarterbacks. And two starkly different postgame takeaways.The game kicked off with fireworks when Steelers tight end Darnell Washington’s over-the-top block on Eagles safety Darius Slay sparked a full-blown brawl. Slay called it “a hockey moment,” but the refs saw it differently, throwing yellow flags only on the Steelers. Mike Tomlin’s sideline reaction? Classic disbelief, caught on camera as he blasted the down judge. Postgame, Tomlin didn’t hold back: “Not a sufficient one,” he said when asked about the ref’s explanation.While Tomlin stewed, Russell Wilson took the podium, admitting, “They played better than us tonight.” With just 128 yards and one TD, Wilson couldn’t find his rhythm, and the Steelers’ defense capitalized. (Via: EssentiallySports)For the first time since 2009, Pittsburgh had only two second-half drives. Against a team like the Eagles, that’s a nightmare. With the Ravens and Chiefs ahead, Wilson knows the urgency is high: “Any great team has to respond.”The Steelers’ next move?

His post highlighted his List A career statistics.Shaw's post questioned his exclusion despite an average of 55.7 across 65 innings, totalling 3,399 runs with a strike rate of 126. He expressed faith and hope that people still believe in him, promising a comeback.The Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) announced the 17-member squad on Tuesday, omitting Shaw. This marks another setback for the young cricketer.""Tell me, God, what more do I have to see… If 65 innings, 3,399 runs at an average of 55.7 with a strike rate of 126 isn’t good enough… But I will keep my faith in you, and hopefully, people still believe in me… because I will come back for sure.

He acknowledged Shaw's abundant talent.""And I have said it before in many interviews. He needs to get his work ethic right. If he does that, the sky is the limit for him. Can you force him to? I can't force him. He has played so much cricket, and everyone has given him inputs. At the end of the day, it’s his job to go out there and figure things out for himself,"" he concluded.Shaw's exclusion from both the Ranji and Vijay Hazare Trophy squads raises concerns about his future.

At the recent Saturday Night’s Main Event , McIntyre clashed with longtime competitor Sami Zayn in a brutal match that had the fans over the edge of their seats. With his evident mix of beast strength and speck precision, McIntyre delivered a striking Claymore Kick that emulated through the arena, marking the win in a dominant rage.Not the one to remain quiet, McIntyre took straight to X (formerly Twitter) to deliver a sharp critique aimed at Marvel’s latest release, Kraven the Hunter. Posting “Unlike Kraven the Hunter I won’t absolutely suck.”McIntyre efficiently stirred the pot, taking a jab at the movie’s wishy-washy reception and distressing box office numbers.

McIntyre also made headlines for his candid and emotional interview with Busted Open Radio whichthat ended with the wrestler making an abrupt exit in the middle of the interview. During the interview, McIntyre spoke about his absence from WWE’s Bad Blood event, stating it to a close family member’s demise and his need to retrieve from his injuries.While McIntyre is creating a buzz ahead of the Netflix kickoff event, we might not be able to see one of the leading names of the wrestling world in modern times, Cody Rhodes . While suffering from an injury in the last match to defend his title at Saturday Night’s Main Event, Rhodes was attacked by Owens post-match, leading to a cervical spine injury. It was said on WWE Raw that Rhodes was expected to make an appearance on the Netflix debut; however, this unfortunate event led to his replacement by the World Heavyweight Champion,GUNTHER .While expressing deep frustration with the wrestling industry and highlighting his personal sacrifices in his wrestling career of almost two decades, the wrestler stated,“I’ve missed birthdays, weddings, some funerals I should have been at. My mum passed; I went home for a couple of weeks and went straight back to work. I never truly dealt with it. Going home this time, spending real time with my family, and I realised I might have made a mistake. I’ve been giving and giving and giving to this industry, and it has taken and taken and taken from my real family.”“I’m trying to keep it together and respect everyone who is sitting with me right now. But as much as we are on the road, we call each other family; that’s a matter of convenience. I was with my real family and when I was gone for that 3 months, I can count on one finger how many people checked in, ‘How are you doing, Drew?’ It really opened my eyes.”ALSO READ: WWE Saturday Night's Main Event 2024: Drew McIntyre Defeats Sami Zayn As speculations swirl, McIntyre’s unpredictability only adds to his facade, blurring the line between real life and storyline in classic wrestling fashion.

WWE Fanbase is Extremely Happy With The New Day Being Removed From the Men’s Locker Room

Following Big E’s removal from the New Day , Kofi Kingston and Xavier Woods have faced a lot of backlash from WWE fans. And as of this week’s episode on RAW, the two stars were kicked out of the men’s locker room, because they did Big E extremely dirty.Big E’s been away from wrestling for a while now, thanks to an injury and it is unclear when he'll be returning to the ring again. That said, it’s an interesting storyline to explore because this faction has been pillars of positivity and have been baby faces for the longest time known. Turning them heel right now brings about a very interesting dynamic, and gives the WWE Creative team a lot of space to explore with their forthcoming storylines. With that said, WWE fans were elated to know that these two troublemakers had been kicked out of the men’s locker room at the Stamford-based promotion, after what they did to Big E, two weeks ago.It was Rey Mysterio who delivered the message to them saying that they were no longer welcome to change into their ring attire in the men’s locker room after whatever they did to Big E. He said, “You guys crossed the line with E. I think it’s best, for your own good, if you find somewhere else to change.”Following Rey Mysterio’s exchange with the two of them, the entire WWE Universe had a similar reaction to the entire segment. One fan said, “Kofi and Xavier ruined Big E's moment,” while another fan added, “Got the Miz treatment.” While most of this banter took place on Instagram, it’s worth noting that it has indeed raised a storm on social media where the New Day have become an extremely hated team at this point in time.It’s a good thing to be honest, considering that they’re receiving negative attention at this point. They’ve literally been advertised as a pillar of positivity and their babyface run was becoming stale. Although they shouldn’t probably have dealt with Big E in such a harsh manner, it was executed very well, and was probably the only way in which the WWE Creative team could establish the two members of the New Day as some worthy heel characters in the company right now.Although their heel transformation has begun, it hasn’t been completed just yet. They’re still two extremely chilled out individuals, but they’ll need to go aggressive sometime soon, otherwise their heel push won’t really matter anymore.Kofi Kingston later on took to X to express his frustration about being kicked out of the locker room, while calling out Rey Mysterio in the post too. With this in mind, it’s likely that his next big feud will be against Mr 619, but it’ll be interesting to see how things pan out for these wrestlers moving forward.Also read: WWE Raw Results and Highlights 12/16: CM Punk and Seth Rollins, World Tag Team Championship match and more","Kofi Kingston and Xavier Woods were kicked out of the men's locker room on this week's episode of WWE Raw.

Patrick Mahomes’ Parents Divorced In 2006 And Have Moved On With Their Lives



The NFL star and the quarterback of the Kansas City Chiefs, Patrick Mahomes have always credited his family for success. His mother, Randy Mahomes has always praised her elder son Patrick and spoken about the confidence she has in him. But his father, Patrick Lavon Mahomes mostly stays out of the spotlight. Let’s take a look at the early life of the NFL star’s biggest supporter, his mother Randy and her marriage.Patrick’s father, Patrick Lavon Mahomes, also known as Pat Sr. should be credited for the athleticism that his son Mahomes enjoys. Back in the late 1980s, Pat Sr. was extremely active when it came to football as he was studying at Lindale High School. He became an all-state in football, basketball and baseball and began his professional career in Major League Baseball where he was a pitcher for teams such as Minnesota Twins, Pittsburgh Pirates, New York Mets and the Boston Red Sox. He began his professional career in MLB back in 1992 and retired from MLB 11 years later, in 2003.Pat Sr. met Randy Mahomes back when Randy graduated from Texas High School where she was a cheerleader and they tied the knot shortly after. They share two children together - NFL star Patrick Mahomes and his younger brother Jackson Mahomes who is a social media star.Pat Sr. and Randy’s marriage unfortunately did not last very long and they amicably called it quits back in 2006. Even though today they maintain a friendly relationship with each other, their marriage was not that easy. As per Randy’s website, she had opened up about her marriage going through some tough times which eventually led to the divorce in 2006.However, after Pat Sr. and Randy divorced each other, they maintained a friendly co-parent relationship with each other so that their two sons were not very affected by the divorce as they were pretty young back then. Patrick has credited both his parents for his success and they continue to be friendly with each other.After the divorce was finalised, Patrick’s father Pat Sr. had one more son and two daughters who are now half siblings of Patrick’s. His mother, Randy also moved on and gave birth to Patrick’s half sister Mia Randall but Patrick’s family has chosen to remain private about the father of Mia and has not revealed the father’s name in public.Also Read: Joe Burrow’s rumoured girlfriend Olivia Ponton talks about the challenges of long-distance relationships, raising eyebrows about her connection with Joe Burrow Randy is mostly seen cheering and supporting her older son whenever he plays a match and is one of the strongest motivators for Patrick. In her free time, she keeps herself busy with charity work and is very involved with a charity organisation that supports children with special needs called Variety KC.","Patrick Mahomes’ Parents Divorced In 2006 And Have Moved On With Their Lives.

Daniel Vettori Press Conference

NEW DELHI: Legendary Sunil Gavaskar expressed his frustration with Mohammed Siraj after he engaged in a mix-up with Ravindra Jadeja during Day 4 of the third Test match against Australia in Brisbane on Tuesday.The incident unfolded in the 62nd over when Jadeja took a single off the fourth ball, giving Siraj the strike. It appeared that Siraj would play out the remaining two deliveries.However, that was not the case as Siraj took a single off the next ball that led to a massive mix-up between the batters.The replay showed that a direct hit could have resulted in another dismissal for India, but the throw was wide, allowing the batters to complete the run.Jadeja seemed visibly frustrated with Siraj's actions, and the incident also caught Gavaskar's attention, who was left furious and questioned Siraj's decision in such a high-stakes moment.""Even now, in the middle of the crease, they are having a conversation. Siraj is having a conversation. What's going on over here? One ball is left in the over. All you've got to do is stick around. There is no run. It looks to be in a very casual manner. Look at that. There's got to be some cricketing awareness. You are a no.9 batter. You have to think about team. You cannot think of taking risky singles,"" Gavaskar said while commentating on Star Sports. Jasprit Bumrah and Akash Deep pulled off an improbable 10th-wicket partnership to avoid the follow-on and put the match on track for a draw. When the pair came together, India still needed 33 runs to force Australia to bat again at the Gabba, on a day affected by rain delays.Despite the gloomy skies, the duo managed to withstand Australia's feared pace attack, frustrating the home side on day four.Akash Deep played a key role in scoring the crucial runs, edging a boundary just past the outstretched hand of Nathan McSweeney off Australian captain Pat Cummins.He celebrated two balls later by launching Cummins over deep mid-wicket for a huge six, before umpires called off the day’s play due to bad light, with India at 252-9, still trailing by 193 runs.","Mohammed Siraj involved in mix-up with Ravindra Jadeja during Day 4 of the third Test match against Australia in Brisbane.

""He's in good spirits,""

""He's been through the process before,""

""He recognises the importance of taking things one step at a time. He's performing admirably in that regard. He will eventually return, and he will keep improving.""

Sad news for the Oklahoma City Thunder fans,will not be playing against the Milwaukee Bucks. Holmgren is currently recovering from a right iliac hip fracture and as a result, he will be absent from the Emirates NBA Cup final between the Milwaukee Bucks and the Oklahoma City Thunder.Holmgren's presence on the court would have been quite helpful for the Thunder in this highly important game. Nevertheless, the Thunder have managed to maintain an outstanding 20-5 record despite Chet Holmgren missing the majority of the games. They are now the top team in the Western Conference as a result.Chet Holmgren was having a fantastic season prior to the injury, averaging 16.4 points, 8.7 rebounds, and 2.6 blocks per game in 10 games. With a field goal percentage of 50.5% and a beyond-the-arc shooting percentage of 37.8%, he was also shooting well. In a high-stakes matchup with players like Giannis Antetokounmpo and Brook Lopez, his ability to stretch the floor with his shooting and defend the rim with his shot-blocking would have been crucial against the Bucks.While Holmgren won’t be able to contribute on the court, he is still hopeful for his team's victory tonight.

Virat Kohli is one of the greatest players ever: Mitch Marsh

BRISBANE: Australia captain Pat Cummins was off for a mini victory lap and the celebration, with some spot hops, even got Mitchell Marsh going as the hosts saw the back of Rohit Sharma . The Indian captain dragged himself off the field and left his gloves in front of the dugout before entering the dressing room.It was his fourth consecutive failure on Australian soil and the right-hander never looked comfortable against Cummins who was in the middle of a fantastic spell in the morning session. Ball-after-ball, the seamer kept pinging the good-length spot and made subtle use of different angles to keep the batter guessing. With Rohit on strike, a short-ball was not too far away either and the Australian captain fired one in the 24th over.Just like Virat Kohli seemingly finds it hard to resist playing at deliveries outside off, Rohit never misses an opportunity to have a swing against short-pitch stuff. He went after that Cummins delivery but failed to make any connection. The next delivery was a perfect follow-up as he returned to the good length and got the ball to straighten just enough from the incoming angle to find Rohit's edge.It was the epitome of a nothing shot. The feet went nowhere close to the ball and Rohit pushed at the delivery with just his hands. He got into no position and was very loose with that push. A nothing push. The Indian captain didn't even wait for the ball to come close to him, under his eyeline, and instead chose to use his hands to get to it.The Australian seamers - Mitchell Starc and Cummins - were bowling well in tandem but a tighter approach could have allowed Rohit to cash in during the period the oldish kookaburra stops doing its tricks. The pitch was baking under the sun and even a watchful 40-45 minutes could have allowed him to put the past horrors behind him. The hosts were already a bowler short as Josh Hazlewood picked up a calf strain and was ruled out for the remainder of the Test.It meant there were some release overs coming their way but Rohit never lasted that long to make most of that period.Since landing in Australia, there has been a clear lack of confidence in his approach and the baggage of past failures is clearly weighing his batting down, and also affecting his underwhelming captaincy.Rohit has been a royal disappointment in his last few Tests and has managed just one half-century in last 13 innings. Majority of those failures came as an opener but even the move down the order, to accommodate an in-form KL Rahul at top of the order, hasn't made any difference to his returns.Scott Boland got him with an indipper in the first innings of pink-ball Test, Cummins castled him with a beauty in the second innings and more disappointment could be in store on the remainder of the tour if the captain doesn't tighten up.Rohit doesn't need to look too far to get some inspiration as the man he vacated his opening spot for is batting like a dream!",Rohit Sharma dismissed by Pat Cummins at The Gabba in Brisbane.

The finals of the Emirates NBA Cup -- will take place in Las Vegas, Nevada. Giannis Antetokounmpo of the Milwaukee Bucks has been very particular on and off the court about his team's intention. They have dominated almost every matchup and it is unlikely that we will see an upset tonight.Everything you need to know about the game, including injury reports, important players, broadcast information, and more, will be covered in this article.- Shai Gilgeous-Alexander- Isaiah Hartenstein- Giannis Antetokounmpo- Damian Lillard- Moneyline: Thunder (-200) vs Bucks (+165)- Spread: Thunder (-4.5) vs Bucks (+4.5)- Total (O/U): Thunder -108 (O 110.5)For bettors looking to increase their excitement, a Same Game Parlay (SGP) offers an intriguing opportunity. The suggested SGP includes Bucks +5, Giannis to record 12+ rebounds, and Caruso to notch 2+ steals. This combination comes with +499 odds, making it a compelling option for those seeking a higher payout.The Milwaukee Bucks enter the final as a +5 underdog, but many believe backing them to cover is a smart move. With a trophy on the line here, both teams will be extra motivated to get the victory and we would argue there is not a lot that separates the two squads. Milwaukee has dominated this matchup in the past, winning six of the last seven games against Oklahoma City. The Bucks' experience is also seen as a key factor, with Giannis Antetokounmpo’s championship run adding to their big-game credentials.A major focus for Milwaukee is the rebounding battle, where Giannis Antetokounmpo is expected to deliver on the court. He’s being tipped to record at least 12 rebounds, a mark he has hit in eight of his last nine games against the Thunder. Antetokounmpo has had some really big numbers in recent head-to-head games, averaging 15.6 rebounds per game in the last 9 vs OKC. This is bolstered by OKC's rebounding struggles, as they allow 57.5 boards per game this season, the most in the league alongside the Washington Wizards. Giannis recently grabbed 14 rebounds in a win over Atlanta, which shows off his current form.On the other side of the court, the Oklahoma City Thunder’s defensive prowess has been a major storyline. They currently lead the Western Conference and are riding a five-game win streak. A key contributor to their defensive dominance is Alex Caruso, who has become a crucial part of OKC’s backcourt since returning from injury. One of the reasons why the Thunder have been so successful this year is definitely their defense, getting Caruso back from injury has elevated them even more in that department.Caruso is tasked with guarding Damian Lillard, and his ability to rack up steals could play a pivotal role. He’s recorded at least two steals in five of his last six games and has done so three times in five career games against Lillard. OKC’s defense has been stifling this season, especially against point guards, allowing only 20.7 points per game to players at that position.With the Bucks’ experience and OKC’s elite defense, this NBA Cup Final has all the makings of a classic. While the Thunder have been one of the best teams in the Western Conference this season, Milwaukee’s dominance in head-to-head meetings gives them a psychological edge. The close nature of this matchup has led many to predict a nail-biter of a final. If we get a close finish here, which the neutrals are rooting for, then backing Milwaukee to cover is the more reasonable choice.With a championship on the line, every possession counts, and both teams have a lot to prove. Will OKC's oppressive defence and Caruso's disruptive presence be too much for the Bucks to handle, or will their experience and ability to rebound lead them to victory? To discover out, fans will need to tune in on Tuesday night.The match between the Thunder and the Bucks will take place on December 17, 2024, at 8:30 pm ET. It will take place at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada.Also read: Top 30 most valuable NBA teams of 2024 - Live Stream: fuboTV (Watch for free)- NBA League Pass: NBA TV.

Making use of conditions which are familiar to her since she plays for Mumbai Indians in the Women's Premier League, Matthews turned the chase into a cruise as she put on 66 in 40 balls for the first wicket with fellow opener Qiana Joseph (38, 22b, 6x4, 2x6) and then added an unbeaten 94-run stand for the second wicket with ‘keeper-batter Shemaine Campbelle (29 not out, 26b, 4x4) in merely 55 balls.Matthews smacked four fours in a row off left-arm spinner Radha Yadav in the 11th over, and then hit three consecutive fours off seamer Saima Thakor in the 14th over to punish India’s mediocre bowling attack.Earlier, putting her hand up in skipper Harmanpreet Kaur’s absence due to a knee injury, Smriti Mandhana rode her luck, being dropped thrice, to score her second successive fifty (62, 41b, 9x4, 1x6), while ‘keeper-bat Richa Ghosh scored a breezy 32 (17b, 6x4), as India made a fighting score of 159 for nine.While Mandhana held fort through the initial part of the innings when India looked shaky, Ghosh provided the much-needed impetus in the slog overs with her boundary-laden cameo, tonking leggie Afy Fletcher for three fours in the 18th over, which went for 17.Brief Scores: India 159/9 (Smriti Mandhana 62, Richa Ghosh 32; Deandra Dottin 2/14) lost to West Indies 160/1 in 15.4 overs (Hayley Matthews 85*, Qiana Joseph 38) by nine wickets",West Indies beat India by nine wickets in second Women's T20I.

CHENNAI: “Nothing special, these events was just a warm-up for me ahead of the FIDE World Rapid and Blitz Chess Championships ,” Grandmaster Pranav Venkatesh told TOI after striking double gold at the FIDE World Youth Under-18 Open Rapid and Blitz Championships in Slovenia on Tuesday.As the top seed in both sections and the sole Grandmaster in the events, the 18-year-old Chennai boy lived up to his billing with ease. In the rapid category, Pranav scored 9.5/11 to finish half-a-point clear of his nearest challenger. Russia’s FIDE Master Alexander Khripachenko scored 9/11 to secure silver, while FM Roman Pyrih of Ukraine bagged bronze scoring 7.5/11.Pranav stunned the field in blitz with a staggering 19.5/22, clinching the title with a round to spare and finishing four points ahead of the silver winner. Russia’s Dmitry Mochalov claimed silver with 15.5/22, while his compatriot Khripachenko took bronze (14.5/22). International Master Eline Roebers from the Netherlands stood out as the only female participant in the open events. Delivering a remarkable performance, she secured 7.5 points out of 11 to claim the fourth place in the rapid category. The talented Dutch teenager was also one of just two players to defeat Pranav in the blitz format.Pranav hopes to take confidence from these events ahead of his next challenge at the World Rapid and Blitz Worlds, scheduled to be held at the Wall Street from December 26 to 31. “I’m very happy with my wins and I’m looking forward to continuing my good form in New York.”Pranav, who was introduced to chess at seven by his father Venkatesh, has been steadily rising through the ranks. Two years ago, he became India’s 75th GM and a month ago, Pranav won the Challenger section of the Chennai Grand Masters tournament.

KL Rahul Press Conference

NEW DELHI: When Akash Deep walked out to bat at Gabba on Tuesday, India looked dead, almost getting ready to be buried. The score was 213/9. Ravindra Jadeja had fallen without finishing the job after a competent 77. Safety still lay 33 distant runs beyond. A follow-on looked inevitable. But Akash surprised the cricket world.Once his senior partner Jasprit Bumrah had powered a six over deep fine leg, Akash took charge. He not only defended with assurance, but also essayed square drives, struck back-foot shots on the up. He was unflustered by anything that Cummins and Starc threw at him. In his unbeaten 31-ball stay, he played only one false shot: a French cut off Cummins.Without the hosts even realising it, he hustled them. His upper cut for four not only saved India from follow-on, but had the Indian dressing room in boisterous glee. If something draws out a smile from coach Gautam Gambhir, it must be really special.As a No. 11, Akash’s unbeaten 27 is second only to Shivlal Yadav’s 41 in Adelaide 1985 for an Indian cricketer in Australia. The unbroken 39-run partnership, where Bumrah contributed 10, has not only bolstered India’s chance of wrenching out a draw, but equally importantly, is the badly-needed inspirational act for the struggling batters.The duo’s approach underlined that no matter how hard the situation is, goals can be achieved if you put your mind to it. As the song from the 1977 Hindi film, 'Aadmi Sadak Ka' goes, 'koi kaam nahi hai mushkil jab kiya irada pukka'. Such sentiments may not be hard to understand for Akash Deep, who overcame life’s many hardships to reach where he is today.Earlier, he had toiled without luck while bowling. His figures (1/95) don’t reveal the number of times he beat Steve Smith and Travis Head. With this innings, he has given himself a belated birthday gift having turned 28 last week.","Akash Deep's unbeaten 27 is second only to Shivlal Yadav’s 41 in Adelaide 1985 for an Indian cricketer in Australia.

Dave Meltzer expects The Rock’s major involvement in WWE in 2025



The Rock’s return to WWE has been highly anticipated, especially considering John Cena’s retirement tour in 2025. Fans expect the two veterans in professional wrestling to collide, at least, one more time. Amid the anticipation, WWE insider Dave Meltzer has recently speculated on The Final Boss’ 2025 calendar teasing that The Rock will be involved in WWE’s upcoming storylines. While nothing has been confirmed as of yet, his return to WWE would be a major boost to the coming year’s plans.The Rock is still the biggest name among the active WWE superstars. While the part-time WWE star, full-time actor, and businessman has a very tight schedule, he is expected to be present at WWE’s major events in 2025, including Raw’s historic debut to streaming as the Red Brand is set to move to Netflix on January 6.Dave Meltzer of Wrestling Observer Radio has recently speculated that The Final Boss will dedicate much of his time to WWE. ""I don't know if he's showing up or not [at the Netflix premiere],"" Meltzer said.""I would expect that he's going to be on that show in some form, but nobody's confirmed it or anything like that to me. I just figure it's a spot where Netflix is going to want him there, I think he's going to want to be there on the most viewed show, just for that. What he's going to do is going to depend on his schedule,” he continued.John Cena is reportedly starting his retirement tour in 2025 starting with Raw’s Netflix debut and WWE may add a major story involving the duo. However, The People’s Champion’s schedule for WWE is still under wraps.Meltzer added, ""If he's got something at Mania, I would expect he'll shoot the angle right there. And if he's not going to be at WrestleMania, wrestling...I'm sure he'll be at Mania, don't get me wrong. I'm sure that he'll be there that day. Whether he'll have a match is the question. And that just depends on, you know, him...But yeah. I don't know if he's going to wrestle at WrestleMania, and I think that January 6, when that first Netflix show is over, I think that we'll probably have an answer, I would think.""Also Read: The Rock Personally Called Who?

WWE has recently shared that Rhodes has been officially diagnosed with axial compression of the cervical spine, as well as a cervical strain with spasm.

Border-Gavaskar Trophy: Rohit Sharma's troubles mount with another cheap dismissal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-in-australia/rohit-sharmas-troubles-mount-with-another-cheap-dismissal/articleshow/116416443.cms,"Rohit Sharma after his dismissal at The Gabba on Tuesday.

KL Rahul Press Conference

BRISBANE: There's no easy way to couch the issue. Captain Rohit Sharma 's Test career stands at the crossroads in this mid-point of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy series. It is imperative for India that he recovers some batting form in the remainder of the series.The image of a disappointed Rohit trudging back, after yet another cheap dismissal, has been a constant feature since the Adelaide Test. To complicate matters, Rohit has given up his usual batting position. KL Rahul 's extraordinarily disciplined effort at the Gabba on Tuesday, to back up a match-winning effort in Perth, means the opening slot is now his.Asking Rahul to give up opening now, just because it was meant to be a stop-gap arrangement, will be unfair on current form and detrimental to the team's interests.Rohit, who is above all a team man, must now reshape his approach and technique to suit the middle-order, where he is likely to bat in the immediate future. Having to do so in the heat of a hard-fought series in Australia, complicates matters for the 37-year-old Rohit.Having joined the team just a few days before the pink-ball Test, Rohit's poor returns in Adelaide were disruptive but could be explained away. Here, in the third Test, with the team in dire straits, he was expected to rediscover some semblance of his old self on Tuesday.Instead, counterpart Pat Cummins exposed his frailties, baiting him with a fuller delivery which Rohit, whose footwork was never his strong suit, reached out for and promptly edged to Alex Carey behind the stumps.When play began, Rohit was yet to open his account and Cummins applied the pressure with three slips, two gullies and a forward short leg. Rohit began well, showed he was amenable to leaving deliveries, and got off the mark against Starc in the next over with a single towards the cover region. Cummins, though, troubled him, in spite of the batter hitting a cracking four behind square off a loose delivery.Australia's pacer-captain clearly had a separate plan for Rahul and Rohit. To Rohit he began the next over slightly fuller, bowling in the channel in the good length area, before unleashing a short one down leg which pushed Rohit on the backfoot and deep inside his crease, the batter shaping up for the pull and missing. The third ball was fuller again and Rohit lunged forward, just that the front foot didn't move further enough to cover the line of the ball. Another loose shot, and out for 10.Rohit fumed off, throwing his gloves in front of the dugout to fuel some intense social-media speculation. The gloves just lay there in the open, deep into India's innings, until a member of the support staff picked them up.It was the sixth time in 12 innings that Cummins had dismissed Rohit, sparking de bate over whether the team, already struggling as a batting unit, could afford to carry him for the remaining two Tests.Without mentioning Rohit or anyone in particular, Rahul, when asked about the batting unit's plans for a turnaround, said, ""I'm quite certain that everybody has their own set plans. The only thing you can do in the first 30 overs is to tighten up your defence. Try and respect that the first 30 overs is the bowler's time and give them their time, leave balls, try and play as tight as possible and then really try to cash in once the ball gets older. So that's my plan, and that's pretty simple. I'm sure that's the plan for everybody.""In Rohit's case, the numbers tell the story. He is averaging less than 20 (19.66) in his last 9 Tests.The pressure to score has seemed to scramble his captaincy at times, as Ian Chappell has noted. Ravi Shastri criticized his field placements when Travis Head was on the rampage. The likes of Ricky Ponting and Cheteshwar Pujara have pointed out why Rohit is a natural opener who needs to return to the top of the order.On Tuesday, Rohit's gloves, lying there under the gloomy Queensland skies, was a pointer to his troubles.","Rohit Sharma's Test career stands at the crossroads in this mid-point of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy series.

NEW DELHI: ""You are questioning my batting ability,"" Jasprit Bumrah might have jokingly answered a journalist query, but the India pace spearhead showed that besides being a top-ranked Test bowler, he also possesses what it takes to be a batter, especially in crunch situations.""Hi, Jasprit. What is your assessment of the batting, although you are not the best person to answer the question, but what do you think about the situation of the team, considering the conditions in Gabba?,"" journalist asked after the third day of the third Test in Brisbane.""It's an interesting question. But, you are questioning my batting ability. You should use Google and see who has got the most number of runs in a Test over. But, jokes apart. That's another story,"" Bumrah gave journalist a reality check on Monday.Bumrah reminded everyone of his unique achievement as a batter: holding the record for the most runs scored in a single over in Test cricket - 35 runs off Stuart Broad On the penultimate day of the Brisbane Test, when India's top order crumbled like a pack of cards, Bumrah ensured to walk the talk, rising to the occasion to bail India out of a precarious position.India found themselves in deep trouble, reeling at 213/9 and needing another 33 runs to avoid the follow-on. However, what followed reflected that Bumrah can also excel with the bat when the team needs him the most.Bumrah frustrated Australia's star-studded bowling attack with his dogged resistance, holding his nerve to help India avert the follow-on, as they finished the day's play at 252/9 still 193 runs behind Australia's first innings 445.Bumrah forged a resilient 39-run partnership for the 10th-wicket with Akash Deep which is the highest 10th-wicket stand for India at the Gabba and the second-highest last-wicket partnership overseas since 2020. Interestingly, Bumrah was also part of the biggest one - a 50-run stand with Mohammed Siraj against England.Bumrah displayed a strong defensive technique during the last hour of play, effectively handling both fast bowlers and spin deliveries with assurance.The highlight of his unbeaten 10 off 27 balls was a six, where he pulled Australian captain Pat Cummins over fine leg. However, Bumrah played second fiddle to Akash Deep, who entertained everyone with an unbeaten 27 off 31 balls, including two fours and a six.Bumrah has scored 310 runs in 43 matches at a modest average of 7.20, but these numbers don't reflect the importance of the crucial cameos he plays for the team.",Jasprit Bumrah holds record for most runs scored in a single over in Test cricket.

After dropping KL Rahul on his overnight score of 33, Steve Smith came up with a one-handed blinder in the slips to deny the Indian opener a well-deserved century after leading India's fight on day four of the Brisbane Test at the Gabba .Tuesday got off to a dramatic start when Rahul edged Pat Cummins on the first ball of the day but heaved a sigh of relief to see Smith dropping a sitter at second slip.It cost Australia as Rahul added another 51 runs to his and India's score before he tried to cut off-spinner Nathan Lyon off while rocking back on a length delivery and got a thick outside edge that looked like flying past Smith's outstretched right arm before it stuck in his palm.It ended Rahul's knock of 84 and his 67-run partnership with Ravindra Jadeja.India started the day at a precarious 51 for 4 in reply to Australia's first innings total of 445, which included centuries from Travis Head (152) and Smith (101).It soon became 74 for 5 after captain Rohit Sharma (10) fell early in the day, edging Cummins to wicketkeeper Alex Carey.Conditions at the Gabba remained overcast, and the first session on Tuesday saw rain interrupting play briefly.The five-Test Border Gavaskar Trophy is level at 1-1.",KL Rahul dropped by Steve Smith on 33 on day four of the Brisbane Test.

Former Indian cricket coach Ravi Shastri has publicly supported former England cricketer Isa Guha following her apology for a comment made during the third Border-Gavaskar Trophy Test match at The Gabba. Guha’s comment sparked discussions about unconscious bias and cultural sensitivity in sports commentary.Shastri expressed his support for Guha during a Fox Cricket broadcast.“Brave woman. To do it on live television and apologise takes some steel, and you heard it from the horse’s mouth. As far as I’m concerned, game over. People are entitled to make mistakes—we are all human—and in the heat of the moment, like you saw with the Siraj incident with Travis Head , sometimes, when you have a mic in your hand, things can happen. But to own up, to put your hand up and say, ‘I’m sorry if things have gone out of place,’ takes courage. She’s done it, so let’s move on.”Ravi Shastri’s supportive comments emphasised the need for understanding and forgiveness in such situations. His statement suggested that acknowledging and apologising for a mistake is a crucial step towards moving forward.The incident occurred on Sunday when Guha, responding to Brett Lee ’s praise of Jasprit Bumrah ’s bowling performance, referred to Bumrah as the “MVP—Most Valuable Primate.”Guha’s intention was to highlight Bumrah’s significant contributions as India’s leading bowler in a challenging match. However, the use of the word “primate” generated controversy.Guha subsequently issued an apology for her choice of words.“Yesterday in commentary, I used a word that can be interpreted in a number of different ways. I’d like to apologise for any offence caused. I set myself really high standards when it comes to empathy and respect for others,” said Guha.She clarified her intent and expressed regret for her phrasing.“If you listen to the full transcript, I only meant the highest praise for one of India’s greatest players—someone I admire greatly. I’m an advocate for equality and someone who has spent their career thinking about inclusion and understanding in the game,” she added.Guha further explained her background and stressed the absence of any malice in her comment. She also expressed hope that the incident would not overshadow the ongoing Test match.“I was trying to frame the enormity of his achievement and I’ve chosen the wrong word. For that, I am deeply sorry. As someone who is also of South Asian heritage, I hope people will recognise that there was no other intention or malice, and I hope this hasn’t overshadowed what has been a great Test match so far. I look forward to seeing how it progresses.”The incident has reignited discussions about responsible commentary and the significance of cultural sensitivity in sports broadcasting.

We as a team are going through transition: Jasprit Bumrah

NEW DELHI: Legendary Sunil Gavaskar voiced his anger over the shot selection of Shubman Gill in the first innings of the third Test in Brisbane on Monday. The former India captain urged Gill to ‘leave your image in the dressing room’ and put the fancy shots in his 'back pocket'.Gill chased a delivery outside off stump, playing it away from his body, resulting in an outside edge. Mitchell Marsh pulled off a brilliant catch at gully off Mitchell Starc's bowling.""Leave your image in the dressing room,"" Gavaskar said on Star Sports.""Certain shots are dangerous at the start of your innings before you are set, and you don't have the measure of what the wicket is doing. Keep all those shots in your back pocket. Take them out when you are 30-40-50 not out, then can you get those shots again,"" Gavaskar said.""Not very good shot selection, you could say. It was a very good catch, so there was a little bit of bad luck as well over there. But he could have left that ball alone; it would have gone harmlessly to the wicketkeeper,"" he further added.Gavaskar also urged Virat Kohli to take inspiration from Sachin Tendulkar 's iconic 241 against Australia in Sydney in 2004, advising him to avoid playing the cover drive to overcome his ongoing struggles with deliveries outside the off-stump.""He (Kohli) only needs to look at his hero, Sachin Tendulkar. The way in which he (Tendulkar) had kept his patience and control on his off-side game, scoring those 241 runs at Sydney,"" Gavaskar told Star Sports.Kohli suffered yet another failure as Josh Hazlewood dismissed him for 3, leaving a struggling India at 51 for 4 at stumps on Day 3, trailing by 394 runs.",Former India captain Sunil Gavaskar voiced his anger over the shot selection of Shubman Gill in the first innings of the third Test in Brisbane.

In the high-pressure crucible of the World Chess Championship , it wasn’t just the brilliance of D Gukesh ’s moves that left an indelible mark – it was his unwavering poise under tense situations that etched an unforgettable impression. The 18-year-old prodigy played not only with his mind but also with his heart, fighting every battle as though the board was a stage and he, the lead actor in a drama of unyielding resolve.Yet, it was his demeanour, as much as his daring, that caught the attention of those who observed him up close. Aleksandar Colovic, the Fair Play Officer of the blue-ribbon event tasked with ensuring the tournament’s integrity, noted that his job was made easier because of how well-behaved both Gukesh and former champion Ding Liren were.“They are very similar in many ways – both cultured and well-mannered. They both shook their legs when nervous, but in different ways. They were also very cooperative and kind. True gentlemen,” Aleksandar told TOI.In a world where chess geniuses often arrive wrapped in eccentricity, the Chennai teen has stood apart. Even in moments of extreme pressure, Gukesh maintained an aura of focus. Aleksandar, who observed every move with the precision of a hawk, quickly identified the quality that set Gukesh apart.“Actually, I was really impressed by Gukesh’s constant desire to put up a fight. I think Garry Kasparov or someone had said, ‘In a match between two players, the fighter always wins.’ Gukesh was the better fighter in this tournament. If you look at the games, when Ding was playing with the white pieces, he often avoided a fight. He wanted to be safe – wanted a draw.""But Gukesh wasn’t doing that. He took it to the extreme, avoiding a draw even in positions where he was objectively worse. This characteristic of being a true fighter, not shying away from a challenge, was the main difference that decided the champion,” said Aleksandar, a seasoned Fair Play Officer with extensive experience in events like the Grand Prix and the Candidates Tournament.After the victory, Gukesh praised his 32-year-old opponent, calling him a “true champion” and expressing his admiration. “I would also love to thank my opponent, Ding Liren. He is, in my eyes, a true champion, and we saw that despite a lot of pressure on him, he was able to put up a huge fight. I really admire you,” Gukesh said during the closing ceremony. This graciousness, especially at just 18, added to the impression of a young champion defined not only by his moves but also by his character.Meanwhile, Russian Chess Federation president Andrei Filatov has questioned the way Ding lost to Gukesh, calling for an investigation by FIDE . In response, Aleksandar remarked, “That blunder didn’t come out of nowhere. I mean, this was a long, gruelling game where Gukesh was pressing and pushing, while Ding just wanted the game to end. He was a few moves away, thinking nothing could go wrong, but then he messed up. After almost a month of constant pressure, people crack. That’s normal.”The officer’s role in the tournament was both challenging and rewarding, especially in an era where technology has blurred the lines of fair play. “Players were scanned before entering the play area, passing through different types of scanners to ensure they didn’t have any devices on them or their body. I also ensured no signals entered the glass cube. I really enjoyed it. I knew that maybe I’m becoming part of history here,” Aleksandar explained.","D Gukesh beat Ding Liren to win the World Chess Championship.

Christmas came early to the Indian dressing room on Tuesday at the Gabba , which witnessed euphoric scenes minutes before close of play on day four of the third Test in Brisbane . India legends Virat Kohli , captain Rohit Sharma and chief coach Gautam Gambhir erupted in joy as soon as Akash Deep hit the boundary that ensured the visitors have saved the follow-on and potentially the third Test as well.An unbeaten 39-run partnership of 54 balls for the last wicket between Akash Deep (27*) and Jasprit Bumrah (10*) helped India go past the follow-on target of 246 to finish day four at 252 for 9. Although India still trail the home team's total of 445 by 193 runs, saving the follow-on has almost decisively moved the match towards a draw as Australia will have to bat now in their second innings on day five.But the scenes that went viral on Tuesday were of Kohli, Rohit and Gambhir doing the high fives and laughing heartily to watch Bumrah and Akash destroying Australia's hopes. The ninth wicket fell at the score of 213, when Jadeja was dismissed for a possibly match-saving knock of 77.The most important play of day four came in the last hour. At one stage where Australia were hoping that they could dismiss India, enforce the follow-on and bowl a few overs at the Indian openers before close of play, the visitors went to stumps with still a wicket in hand -- thanks to Bumrah, Akash and Jadeja.KL Rahul remains the top-scorer of India's first innings with his knock of 84.Both Bumrah and Akash showed exemplary display of copybook defence and game-awareness to milk the Australian bowlers with ones and twos and move closer to the follow-on target of 246. Once that was achieved, Akash showed his long-handle skills by hitting Pat Cummins for a six over mid-wicket.The shot brought Kohli on his feet as he ran right up to the glass window at the edge of the dressing room to see how far the ball travelled, while the rest of his teammates applauded with wide smiles on their faces.The importance of this match-saving act is such that it can potentially turn into a turning point in the series that will next move to Melbourne and then to Sydney for the concluding Test -- two venues that should favour the Indian batters more than Perth, Adelaide and Brisbane.","Akash Deep (27) and Jasprit Bumrah (10) help India go past the follow-on target of 246.

Who could replace Rohit Sharma as Team India's captain in Tests?

NEW DELHI: Rohit Sharma has faced intense criticism following India's disappointing performance in the ongoing third Test against Australia at The Gabba.With Australia cruising at the moment, the pressure has continued to mount on the Indian captain, especially after a difficult Sunday, leaving fans frustrated and vocal about his decisions.India won the toss on Saturday and opted to field, a decision that has sparked widespread bitterness.Fans online were quick to express their dissatisfaction, with some arguing that India should have batted first instead of bowling on a pitch that allowed Australia’s openers to settle in comfortably.The frustration has boiled over, and numerous calls for Rohit's resignation have flooded social media platforms.One fan on X, formerly Twitter, expressed their dismay, writing, “He's just not meant for this job, he needs to accept it and resign immediately after this Test irrespective of the outcome of this match.”The sentiment was echoed by others, with another stating, “Rohit Sharma is on the verge of losing five consecutive Tests. We need to start a serious discussion about his captaincy now, and also sack Gambhir for the betterment of Indian cricket .”Rohit's leadership has been scrutinised during this match, with India struggling to capitalise on key moments in the field.The bowlers, such as Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj, have fought hard, but Australia’s top order, led by Travis Head and Steve Smith , has managed to dominate the proceedings.""Look, I mean, today, I thought Akash Deep bowled really well. He bowled his heart out, as did Siraj. You know, Siraj struggled with cramps early in the day, but for him to keep running in, especially late in the day, and deliver short balls and that new-ball spell was great to see,"" bowling coach Morne Morkel said at the end of Day 2.The Australian batters' ability to bat through 80 overs, with steady contributions from both Head and Smith, has only added to the mounting criticism of India's tactical decisions.As the match progresses, India are on the backfoot, and many fans are questioning whether Rohit can handle the mounting pressure.","Rohit Sharma has faced intense criticism following India's disappointing performance in the ongoing third Test against Australia at The Gabba.

Virat Kohli during the net session.

BRISBANE: The sun was out in its full glory and it was a very hot morning in Brisbane before Day 4 got underway. The forecast apps had maintained consensus on rain but the morning didn't suggest that the day would be headed in that direction. As the handful of spectators made their way to The Gabba, there was a lot of noise coming from the nets area. Few Indian training jerseys were spotted from the main junction but the moment one got closer, the cast of the session was revealed.With the training tank top on, Virat Kohli was in the nets and faced a lot of deliveries from Harshit Rana, Prasidh Krishna, Washington Sundar and the throwdown specialists. The India batter kept switching nets for small hits against different attacks as he looked to iron out the flaws which have been leading to his downfalls in the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy .In the first innings at Gabba, the right-hander was out nicking at a delivery well outside the off-stump and chatter of his vulnerabilities in that channel only grew louder. So, here he was, on the morning of the fourth day, sweating out as few spectators observed proceedings from a higher elevation and some were stationed right behind the net. Bowling coach Morne Morkel and assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate were also present to assist Kohli, who also had Devdutt Padikkal batting in the adjacent net.There were drives, plenty of them, during the session and the former captain was comfortably shouldering arms to deliveries on length. Every time he would miscue the drive or shot, Kohli would speak to the throwdown specialist or the bowler and the interactions continued throughout his session.It will be safe to say that he looked assured and solid during that hit before the morning session got underway but the touch of the nets hasn't translated into match form during his recent outings. He scored a hundred in the second innings of the Perth Test but has been dismissed in single digits in three out of the four other innings in the series.There is still a lot of cricket left in the series and India's prolific batter would hope he gets his act right for the next two fixtures in Melbourne and Sydney. And even in the second innings in Brisbane, if weather permits.","Virat Kohli faced a lot of deliveries from Harshit Rana, Prasidh Krishna, Washington Sundar and the throwdown specialists.

Down & out India might just have saved Brisbane Test after Nos. 10, 11, Bumrah and

Akash Deep

, defy Aussie bowlers and help avoid follow-on

BRISBANE: There were only 6171 people in attendance on another stop-start day at the Gabba, but they roared like a million as some incredible scenes played out in the gloom towards the end of Day Four in the third Test.After KL Rahul and Ravindra Jadeja had engineered a remarkable resistance, India still needed to avoid the follow on. Jasprit Bumrah and Akash Deep, the last men standing, were out of their comfort zone with bat in hand. Pat Cummins and Mitchell Starc were breathing fire. The target was still some distance away. The scoreboard showed 213 - 33 runs short of the follow-on target - when Ravindra Jadeja, who stamped his presence for the first time in this series, holed out to deep square in an attempt to tonk Cummins out of the ground.Run by precious run, Bumrah and Deep inched towards the target, goaded on by the loud Indian supporters. Akash Deep is better than a regular No. 11. And as for Bumrah, you just can't keep him out of the game these days.On the previous day, asked about the horrid shots played by some of the top order batters, India's performer of the series had replied with a big grin, ""It's an interesting question. You're questioning my batting ability. You should use Google and see who has the most runs in a Test match, sorry, in a Test over! Jokes apart, that's another story.""There was no time for jokes out in the middle. Bumrah finally got tired of being targeted at his ribs and hooked Cummins over fine leg. Six! The Australian captain smiled. Next ball, a fiery bouncer, was evaded with expert ease. Akash Deep took a single off Starc and settled down. The light was fading fast. With India on 225, Akash Deep cut Starc over wide gully. A crucial four!Bumrah was beaten once but played out a fine over from Nathan Lyon. Deep hit Cummins down the ground for two, pleasing Rohit Sharma. Eventually, the target was whittled down to six, then five runs. Australia's supporters goaded their players on, screaming their lungs out but the side, a major bowler short, looked tired and unsettled at this point.Akash Deep took a single, leaving a calm Bumrah to play out Lyon again. Next over from Cummins, Deep was struck on the thigh first ball. Nerves. Sometime in between, towels, drinks and some messages arrived from the dugout. Don't try to hit everything out of the ground. Keep your poise.Suddenly, a switch went off in Akash Deep's head. He decided he had had enough and slashed hard past a leaping gully. Four! India had avoided the follow-on and rediscovered some self-belief on a most challenging but inspiring day. Deep followed with a six over midwicket, sending the ball soaring into the stands. Six! A statement of intent!Eventually, bad light stopped play with India on 252/9, the last pair having added 39 vital runs.Australia were keen to put India in again if Bumrah and Deep had failed. Even with the loss of Josh Hazlewood to injury, Cummins' men knew their best chance of a win was to rattle India's sketchy top order again. By avoiding the follow-on, Rohit Sharma's men had made their most important statement of the series. They were not prepared to roll over as a batting unit.At the centre of this resistance were KL Rahul and Ravindra Jadeja. Rahul (84 off 139 balls; 8x4) did all the initial hard work and held one end up. He bided his time, left on length, played late, blunted sharply-rearing deliveries with a loose bottom hand, and kept Australia attack at bay until the ball got softer and batting became easier.Some of his drives and check drives were sublime. Rahul also got lucky. Beginning the day on 33, Steve Smith dropped him first ball at second slip as a rearing Cummins delivery took the edge. Smith eventually got his man with an incredible, well-anticipated diving effort off Lyon, but by that time the moment had slipped away from Australia.The other, significant moment of the day for India came when Jadeja (77; 123b, 7x4, 1x6) twirled his bat, swordsman like, to celebrate his half-century and announce to the world that India had erred in keeping him out of the first two Tests. Jadeja had an ordinary day with the ball earlier, but after adding 67 with Rahul, he now averages 50.40 with the bat in Australia from five Tests.On Tuesday, he showed why, displaying immaculate control. He was prepared to leave balls outside off, ready to sweep Lyon, play either straight or square of the wicket. He eliminated the drive. He made full use of the best batting conditions and the tiring attack, but that is what India needed him to do.The series is still 1-1, and India would like to keep it that way heading into Melbourne. The rain may help. With a heavy downpour expected on the last day, wresting a draw here could mark an important turning point for Rohit Sharma's men in this series.","India avoided the follow-on and rediscovered some self-belief on a most challenging but inspiring day.

We had to be a little more sensible and then start launching. We had a good launchpad.""Mandhana praised Richa Ghosh 's quickfire 32 off 17 balls, which helped India cross the 150-run mark. She admitted that the team could have added another 10-15 runs to their total.""Richa batted extremely well, we could have scored 10-15 runs more. Even me, getting out at the wrong time, I could have stayed (at the crease) more. Going forward, we will have to pride ourselves on executing what we want to execute.""According to Mandhana, dew became a factor during the latter half of India's innings. She acknowledged the challenging conditions but emphasized the need to adapt.""It (the dew) was not there as much in the first ten overs of their fielding. Cricket is a game where you cannot complain. We knew dew was going to be there. We have to put our hand up and figure out where to bowl when dew is there and even (be better) at fielding.""West Indies captain Hayley Matthews was pleased with her team's performance. She felt that 160 was a par score and they were happy with restricting India to that total.""We felt 160 was around par, we were happy with what they got in the end.
