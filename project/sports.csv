MUMBAI: “It’s the last dance, we’ve come to the last dance; they’re dimming the lights down, they’re hoping we’ll go.” No, we are not eulogising Frank Sinatra here. We are dimming the lights, closing our eyes, and wondering whether it is indeed “the last dance” for four Indian stalwarts, at least on home soil, in the whites. Virat Kohli , R Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja and Rohit Sharma have all played their part in making India almost unbeatable at home, till the humble and hard-working Kiwis punctured that aura on Saturday in Pune. Come November 1, as fans walk through Churchgate’s D Road and queue up through the turnstiles at the Wankhede, they would do well to turn up in numbers to acknowledge the contributions of this quartet.The next home Test series is only in October 2025 when the West Indies come calling, and given the form and fitness and age of all four of them — Ashwin is 38, Rohit 37, Kohli will be 36 in a week and Jadeja turns 36 in December — one wonders if all four will still be around by then.India have played 55 Tests at home since England beat them 2-1 in the winter of 2012, with the hosts winning a staggering 42 of them and losing just six. Of those 55, this foursome has played in 22 Tests, featuring in 17 wins. Two of the Tests were drawn while three ended in losses. Ironically, all three losses have come under Rohit’s captaincy.The series loss to New Zealand doesn’t seem like a train-wreck. For some time, Ashwin, Jadeja, Kuldeep or Axar Patel have doubled up as useful lower-order batters, which has masked the failures of the top order. Examples: in Bengaluru vs Sri Lanka, 2022; in Kanpur vs New Zealand 2021; in Chattogram and Mirpur vs Bangladesh, 2022; in Delhi vs Australia in 2023; in Ranchi vs England, 2024.Virat Kohli averages 28.3 vs spin in Asia since 2020. The two dismissals in Pune to Mitch Santner suggested that he had a problem perceiving length. Since the start of this decade, Kohli has played 33 Tests and has scored just 1833 runs at an average of 32.73. Five ducks and eight single digit scores in that period makes for grim reading. His once illustrious colleagues in the batting order, who too were part of a golden home run, Cheteshwar Pujara and Ajinkya Rahane, have averaged 32.7 and 32.9 since 2020.The team management chose to move on from them. Rohit Sharma averages 36.2 vs spin in Asia and has seemingly discarded the qualities that made him such a dependable Test batter, especially on that 2021 tour of England where he wasn’t averse to batting time. Now, his game is all about charging at the bowler, which has often seen him losing shape or getting turned around against seam, like it happened against Tim Southee.Since India got knocked out of the T20 World Cup in Adelaide vs England in 2022 and Rohit stressed on batting with intent, he has carried that kamikaze attitude into the Test format too. Of the 32 times he has batted in Tests post Adelaide, he has faced 50 balls or more only 12 times. And when the captain bats in such cavalier fashion, it often compels others to adopt that approach even if it does not suit their game.Ashwin had a forgettable Test in Bengaluru, despite getting more turn than the Kiwi spinners, but he missed his lengths with alarming consistency, allowing Rachin Ravindra and Southee to attack him. Ashwin is yet to miss a home Test since his debut, a remarkable feat considering how much workload he has had to endure. His spells against Australia in the 2017 Border Gavaskar Trophy, while battling sports hernia, are etched in memory, but that was an Ashwin who was seven and a half years younger.Opposition teams are now finding run-scoring against Ashwin easier. The ease with which he was swept and reverse swept would rankle him and his supporters. His career economy rate is 2.83 after 104 Tests, which is surreal. But this year, Bangladesh scored at 3.31 against him. England, adopting Bazball, scored at 4.12, while New Zealand scored at 3.89. When attacked, he has usually bowled faster and flatter, which is a deviation from the champion offie’s style and strength.Ravindra Jadeja’s best spell of the series came on the third day of the Pune Test where he took a cue from Santner and bowled slower and was rewarded. He too has picked up injuries more regularly lately. Of the 55 home Tests since 2013, he has played in 47 of them and missed just eight, six of them post 2021. And with a growing interest in politics and racehorses, one wonders how much longer one will see him toil away.Jadeja’s strength was his nagging accuracy. A bowling average of 20.85 with a combination of a strikerate of 51.3 and an economy rate of 2.43 in those 47 Tests is a freakish testament to that. But this year, at home, he has gone for 3.30. Bangladesh scored at 3.27 against him, England at 3.24, while New Zealand have prospered scoring at 3.44. He has been cut more regularly this year and every time he has responded with a dart at almost 95 kmph.At their pomp, a long on and long off or deep point was a laughable idea. That Rohit Sharma employed them early on in their spells, was an acknowledgement from the skipper that his spin twins’ powers are probably on the wane. Fifteen minutes into session two of Day One of the second Test in Pune, as Rachin Ravindra and Devon Conway were milking Ashwin and Jadeja, Rishabh Pant yelled into the stump mike, “Chalo bhaiyon, body language uthana padega.”For ears that were used to hearing “bowled, Ash” or “bowled, Jaddu bhai,”, it was a harsh reality check.","India have played 55 Tests at home since England beat them 2-1 in the winter of 2012, with the hosts winning a staggering 42 of them and losing just six.

NEW DELHI: Former South Africa opener Gary Kirsten , who famously coached India to their 2011 World Cup win, stepped down as Pakistan’s white-ball coach just six months into a two-year contract. Kirsten's unexpected resignation drew criticism from former cricketers, with many calling out the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) over the situation.Former PCB chairman Ramiz Raja expressed disappointment, describing Kirsten’s abrupt departure as creating ""hodgepodge"" in Pakistan cricket.Kirsten resigned just a week before Pakistan’s upcoming white-ball series against Australia, leading the PCB to appoint Test coach Jason Gillespie as a replacement.“It’s not good news because Pakistan needed an experienced hand like Gary Kirsten. I don’t have inside information, but from a distance, it doesn’t look great to lose your coach right before the start of a tour,” Ramiz said.“Right now, there’s a hodgepodge in Pakistan cricket. The selection committee is nominating the playing XI. I’m not too sure if this happens anywhere else in the world,” Ramiz said.“It’s not a straightforward situation because when someone like Gary Kirsten leaves the job, backlash is inevitable. People will speculate and want to know why he left. It’s not a great advertisement for Pakistan cricket. What you need is to ensure that, once you involve someone, you provide them with clarity regarding their role. I don’t know if that clarity was provided to Gary Kirsten. In the future, Pakistan may face challenges in hiring international talent due to Kirsten’s resignation. It’s not going to be an easy job to attract international coaches,"" he added.Pakistan recently secured a 2-1 Test series win against England and is set to face Australia in three ODIs and three T20Is, beginning November 4.The ODIs will be held in Melbourne, Adelaide, and Perth, with Brisbane, Sydney, and Hobart hosting the T20Is.","Gary Kirsten resigns as Pakistan's white-ball coach just six months into a two- year contract.

There was lot of word going around on Shreyas Iyer and KKR but the two never sat across the table to have any discussion with regards to the plans for future or the IPL retentions.

He has been a hot property in the league and it's no surprise there were approaches from multiple franchise the moment KKR chose to take a backseat.

Not many,"" said an industry source.KKR are one of the few franchises who are spoilt for choice as far as retentions are concerned, and it should come as no surprise that co-owner Shah Rukh Khan had advocated for a smaller action during a meeting between BCCI top brass and franchises earlier this year. KKR wanted more Right to Match (RTM) options and it could well be their strategy at the upcoming mega auction too.With Gautam Gambhir, Ryan ten Doeschate and Abhishek Nayar taking up roles with the Indian cricket team, there will be fresh additions to the KKR backroom set-up and no clarity on captaincy means a very new-look unit could well take the field in the IPL next season.The chatter of Andre Russell Rinku Singh , Sunil Narine and Harshit Rana getting retained is getting louder as the franchise could well use the RTM cards to stick with Varun Chakravarthy and Venkatesh Iyer/Nitish Rana.

NEW DELHI: Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola 's recent comments on the historic rivalry between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo have sparked a fresh wave of discussion and debate in the world of football .Speaking at a pre-match press conference on Tuesday, the Spaniard opened up on a long-running rivalry between Messi and Ronaldo.""No one could beat Messi, only Cristiano. Cristiano was a monster and the father of that monster is Messi. The two have achieved something incredible in the last 20 years,"" said Guardiola.Guardiola's remarks came on the back of the 2024 Ballon d'Or ceremony, where Manchester City's Rodri emerged as the winner, breaking the long-standing duopoly of Messi and Ronaldo.The Spanish midfielder's triumph was celebrated as a victory for Spanish football and a recognition of the often-overlooked role of midfielders in the game.Rodri's win marked a significant milestone, as he became the first defensive midfielder to claim the Ballon d'Or since Lothar Matthaus in 1990 and only the third Spaniard to receive the honour, following in the footsteps of Alfredo Di Stefano and Luis Suarez.His win is particularly noteworthy as it ends a long drought for Spanish players in the Ballon d'Or rankings, with no Spaniard having won the award since Luis Suarez in 1960, despite Spain's ""golden generation"" achieving significant success on the international stage.“Maybe Xavi and Iniesta deserved it at that time, so I think yesterday Rodri achieved what Spanish football deserved worldwide,” Guardiola further added.The 2024 Ballon d'Or ceremony was massively dominated by Rodri's compatriots, national teammate Lamine Yamal winning the Kopa Trophy for the best Under-21 player, Aitana Bonmati securing the women's Ballon d'Or for the second consecutive year, and Jennifer Hermoso being honoured with the Socrates Award for her role in the fight for women's rights in football and her courageous stance against sexism in sport.","Guardiola's comments come on the back of the 2024 Ballon d'Or ceremony.

East Bengal FC ended their winless run of the season in style, blowing away Bangladesh champions Bashundhara Kings 4-0 in their second Group A match of the inaugural AFC Challenge League in Thimphu on Tuesday.Oscar Bruzon’s side, with its back to the wall, finally came to the fore with a statement win, with Dimitri Diamantakos opening the floodgates in just 35 seconds — the club’s quickest goal in international football .Goals from Souvik Chakrabarti (20), Nandhakumar Sekar (26) and Anwar Ali (33) helped East Bengal kill the game as a contest in the first half itself. It was East Bengal’s first win since beating Downtown Heroes in the Durand Cup on August 7, during which period they have lost 8 matches in a row before sharing the spoils 2-2 with Bhutanese side Paro FC in the Challenge League opener.East Bengal got off to a rampaging start, and the way they stormed the Bashundhara area with so much magic and menace that the Bangladesh champions didn’t have an answer to it.Diamantakos started the rout, turning in Lalchungnunga’s low centre across the face of the goal with his left foot. Bruzon’s strategy of pressing the opponents high on the pitch and then finding an attacker with pinpoint and purposeful crosses often bypassing the middle third while Nandhakumar posing a constant threat with his pace and potency along the left flank — kept bearing fruit with almost every move in the first half.In the 20th minute, Naorem Mahesh blew Nandhakumar’s cutback over the bar, but when they came calling again barely a few seconds later, they found an unlikely scorer in Souvik. Bashundhara captain Topu Barman managed to deal with a Saul Crespo attempt, but the East Bengal No. 23 found the back of the net with his left-footed snap shot from the edge of the box.Six minutes later, it became 3-0.Nandhakumar, receiving the ball from Talal, entered the box with his trademark pacey run, took rival defender Raiman Kazi in his stride with a swift outside dodge and drilled the ball into the far corner past goalkeeper Anisur Rahman.There was no let-up in East Bengal’s attacking intensity and Anwar joined the party with a spectacular left-footed strike from near the D. Bashundhara did trouble East Bengal on a few occasions with goalkeeper Prabhsukhan effecting a couple of saves to deny Foysal Fahim while Jonathan Reis had his shot denied by the woodwork.East Bengal too could have swelled their tally had second-half substitutions Cleiton Silva and David Hmar been on target with their shots.East Bengal with 4 points are second in the group and will take on leaders Nejmeh FC of Lebanon, who have won both their matches. The top two finishers of each group from the East will progress to the quarterfinals.","East Bengal FC ended their winless run of the season in style, blowing away Bangladesh champions Bashundhara Kings 4-0 in their second Group A match of the inaugural AFC Challenge League in Thimphu.

Is the Chiefs’ passing game back on track with DeAndre Hopkins?



Patrick Mahomes: 'Our Defense Continues to Play Special Honestly' | NFL Week 7 Press Conference

Hopkins’ arrival could ignite a revival for Mahomes and the Chiefs’ offense

Once the unstoppable force of the NFL , the Kansas City Chiefs now find themselves grappling with a lackluster passing game. With Patrick Mahomes throwing more interceptions than touchdowns for the first time in his career, the urgency for change has never been greater. In a bold move, the Chiefs traded for DeAndre Hopkins from the Tennessee Titans, reigniting hope for a turnaround. But can this once-dominant offense reclaim its former glory? Let’s dive into the details of this high-stakes gamble.Also Read: Tom Brady’s ex-teammate outraged by Jerod Mayo’s betrayal after Bill Belichick's criticism of ‘Disrespectful’ patriots HC Remember when the Kansas City Chiefs ruled the passing game? Those days seem far behind. Once a top-6 passing offense since 2018, the Chiefs have hit a wall. Six games into 2024, Patrick Mahomes has thrown more interceptions (8) than touchdowns (6)—a first for him.In a bid to turn things around, the Chiefs traded for DeAndre Hopkins from the Tennessee Titans, sending a conditional fifth-round pick that could rise to a fourth if he plays 60% of the snaps. The Titans even covered half of Hopkins' remaining salary. While former NFL star Rodney Harrison called it a “home run,” the Chiefs' front office is eyeing further moves.NFL Insider Tom Pelissero revealed on The Rich Eisen Show that the Chiefs aren’t done yet. “Brett Veach has shown he’s willing to make bold moves,” he said, hinting at the possibility of adding another cornerback or receiver to support Mahomes.Once a powerhouse under Andy Reid , Kansas City has dropped to 12th in passing yards, averaging just 221.5 per game. Injuries have taken their toll, with Rashee Rice out for the season, Marquise Brown struggling with a shoulder issue, and JuJu Smith-Schuster sidelined by a hamstring injury. Adding to the struggles, starting running back Isiah Pacheco has been out since Week 3 with a broken fibula.Hopkins arrives with a $26 million contract and disappointing stats for 2024—15 catches, 173 yards, and one touchdown in six games. Yet his career numbers—943 receptions, 12,528 yards, and 79 touchdowns—show he still has plenty to offer. The Chiefs need the elite version of Hopkins, especially after their last loss to the Raiders, a 20-14 defeat at Arrowhead last Christmas.Meanwhile, Rodney Harrison believes there's magic brewing in Kansas City, and fans are eager to see how this season unfolds.“DeAndre Hopkins is going to get a chance to play with a real quarterback,” Harrison exclaimed on ‘NFL on NBC’ this Saturday. “In Andy Reid’s offense, it’s all about creating mismatches and confusion… and now they have an automatic number one.”Reid isn’t wasting any time. Despite Hopkins joining the team mid-week, the coach announced that he’ll “probably” suit up against the Raiders on Sunday—talk about being thrown into the fire! The timing couldn't be better, as the Chiefs are the NFL’s last unbeaten team at 6-0. However, they will be without defensive end Mike Danna, who is still recovering from a pectoral injury.Questions about Hopkins’ durability linger due to his history of hamstring issues, a sprained ankle, and wrist surgery. A torn ligament in his knee during the offseason might also explain his slow start in 2024. Nevertheless, Harrison believes Hopkins’ talent far outweighs these concerns: “Even if he’s covered, he’s really not covered because he has such a long catch radius.”For opposing defenses, DeAndre Hopkins presents a pick-your-poison dilemma. “In the red zone, you have to consider how to take away DeAndre Hopkins, which opens up opportunities for Travis Kelce,” Harrison pointed out. With 37 catches for 446 yards and a touchdown across six playoff games, Hopkins’ experience adds another valuable layer to the Chiefs’ roster. At age 32, he’s not just adding depth—he’s bringing 12 years of Pro Bowl experience and four seasons with over 100 receptions to a receiving corps eager for reliability. The Chiefs are all in, hoping that Hopkins will seamlessly mesh with Patrick Mahomes.Also Read: Latest update on Aaron Rodgers’ recent injury as NFL insider reveals Jets QB's return timeline","The Kansas City Chiefs traded for DeAndre Hopkins from the Tennessee Titans.

We were all with each other at any stage, whether things were working for us or not. Because of that, a lot of things worked in our favor back then.”“The same things are present now also.

exclusive conversation with TimesofIndia.com

Excerpts:

What were your first thoughts when you saw your name in that

. You have gotten used to seeing your names in India squads but this would have felt different?

Exactly a year back, everything which could have gone right did go right for you. You were part of almost every Indian side. What kind of headspace were you in back then?

For a young boy, playing a 50-over World Cup would have been special. Everyone wants that but very few get to experience. You played two games when Shubman Gill was sick, made a useful contribution in the game vs Afghanistan. How was the World Cup experience?

To be ready to bat anywhere for the team, you need to be mentally ready for the challenge. How much work has gone into keeping yourself in the right mental headspace?

WATCH:

There has been a lot of chatter on social media, and a lot of negative chatter too. Does it affect a youngster like you? How do you deal with it?

So have you switched the notifications off to be away from all this?

You can't control social media. Jo bhi chalega... it's okay Ishan Kishan

You spoke about the advice you got from Hardik. If you could talk in detail about the time you spent with the Pandya brothers in Baroda, away from everything. How important was that and how much did benefit you?

From the corporate DY Patil tournament to India A, you took all the steps needed to get to the Indian team. Did it feel like pressing the reset button or looking to make your debut for the country again?

A lot happened in your journey in the last six-eight months. Has the boy grown up into a man during this period?

Will the banter, fun and games continue?

Hasi mazaak to chalta rahega

Did the family also feel that their little boy has grown up. Your father is very passionate about your cricket, did he feel that too?

hota hi hoga

raat bhar dad ke saath baith kar kisi story par maza kar sakte hai

It has been eleven months since Ishan Kishan played for India. A T20I in Guwahati, versus Australia, was the 26-year-old's last outing for the national side. He has been away from the set-up and undergoing the grind in the domestic circuit to impress the men who matter. Again. Since taking a break for personal reasons during the South Africa tour last year, the wicketkeeper-batter recharged his batteries during a long camp in Baroda alongside Hardik Pandya earlier this year and hasn't missed a game since.Starting with the DY Patil T20 tournament, he started taking those baby steps and has been a regular fixture in the domestic team. Indian Premier League, Buchi Babu multi-day tournament for Jharkhand, Duleep Trophy, Irani Cup and now the Ranji Trophy , the left-hander has played every competition on offer. Hundreds in the Duleep Trophy and Ranji Trophy helped him force his way back into the scheme of things as he was named in India A squad for the tour of Australia.For a 26-year-old who was accustomed to seeing his name on India squad sheets, the A call has been special and he is very hungry to play to return to the senior side.In an, the wicketkeeper-batter talks about his time away from the game, the practical advice he got from Hardik and how he rediscovered his hunger in Baroda.Obviously very special for me. I am very happy about it as it's another opportunity for me to go there and perform with a bunch of great players coming on the tour. Very happy about getting my name back and getting everything back on track.I am someone who loves to perform for the team, loves to stay happy and loves to help people around. Looking back, when I used to see my name in every squad I was very happy but I felt I needed to do more for the team. I was never satisfied with the performances... I always used to think about doing better. I was always in that frame of mind. I was happy back then, and right now also.I feel hunger is very important. It comes when you take rest also, when you don't get to play so many matches. That is the time when that hunger kicks in and you would have also seen batters going in and just going bang, bang. That's the thing I felt was missing sometimes but I am really happy about whatever is happening right now.The World Cup was the greatest tournament I have been part of. I feel this is what dreams are made of. I wish we won the final too because we had been so meticulous throughout the tournament. From my junior days, I have never been fussed about my batting position. You have to play for the team and do whatever is required at that given point. Even if they ask you to play at a certain number, you have to be open about it. I feel that is the level where you are ready to perform and just looking to perform whenever you wear that blue jersey. You don't think whether you are batting at No. 3 or No. 4. You just think about scoring runs and focus on doing that.At that point, I just thought of doing my best no matter where I played. I was looking to adapt as per the situation and used to talk to senior players in the team who have performed well in that particular position. You get that experience from other players and just go out there and play your game. When you are playing for your country, you can't ask for a particular number. Whatever place or position you get, you have to be ready to take that.Every individual is different. I feel not everyone would think like that. I feel I am lucky enough that my thinking pattern is very practical. I am a very practical guy. I have spent a lot of time with Hardik (Pandya) and you also know that he is a very practical guy. What's needed, is needed. You don't have to cry about everything... So I have also started thinking like that.At a very young age, I was picked by Mumbai Indians and I have been friends with Hardik for a long time now. So I know how he thinks and I know he also wants me to be a great player so he keeps sharing ideas with me. I am in a very practical zone right now. Even if you get out, it's not like I start thinking 'ye kya ho gaya (what just happened), how will I now perform in the next game'.You need to find that neutral point where even when you score a hundred, you have to be very calm. Even if you get out early, you have to stay grounded. You have to find that right balance. I am very lucky to have guys like Hardik around me who have spoken to me about it. There are moments in cricket where you feel really down. And it's not just for me, it's for every cricketer. But if you find that neutral point, you will get over it. Skills are always there, it's just your mental thing. How you are dealing with things at that point of time. I have been very lucky to be in a very healthy zone throughout my career.I feel negativity will be there on social media. People will troll you if you don't do well and that is very normal. I feel every sportsperson should accept that this is going to happen and you shouldn't make a huge fuss about it. I feel you should enjoy that also because at the end of the day, you know what when you perform then the same set of people will praise you also.That happened with Hardik also. People were trolling him also but he just did his work, performed well in the World Cup and now you can see the result. So this is how it should be... negativity will be there but you have to find that neutral point so that you take everything in a very sporting way.You can't control social media. Jo bhi chalega... it's okay. I feel you don't have to get too much into this social media also. When I speak to younger guys who are getting into big teams, I tell them the same thing to please try and be away from social media.I am very well aware of everything, I haven't switched the notifications off. There will be times when people will go harsh on me... I feel at the end of the day when I perform it's good for my movie (laughs).I had a reality check in Baroda about my hunger towards the game and the process was just too good. When I was there in Baroda, it was not like I was just batting. It was like starting your life again, your cricket again. The same hunger which I used to have when I used to play Sunday-to-Sunday as a kid. We used to crave for matches then and used to wait for a Sunday.In Baroda, we had a plan and a routine. I used to do a lot of yoga and do a lot of meditation. It was not like I was staying only at their place. There was a time when my parents were there and I was spending a lot of time with them and feeling very grounded. I was not in a negative zone because I wasn't in the team. I was in a very healthy space training twice a day for one month. I got to batting only after a month and before that I used to wake up early to meditate and used to see the rising sun. It was so much fun.I used to crave for my batting in Baroda also during training because batting happened only after a month of training. It was the best time of my life. IPL didn't go that well but it was a very big learning for me that no matter what you do, everything will not go your way. There will be times when god will check you and that's the time you have to be very stable in life. Very practical and very grounded.You have to keep playing your game because at the end of the day, there is so much competition. Everyone wants to play for India and I am very happy for everyone who is playing for the country. There is so much healthy competition that you start enjoying it and don't take it as additional pressure.I am not thinking on those lines (pressing the reset button). I feel very hungry right now and I know I will just smack the bowlers whenever I get the opportunity again. I am going to go all in. I am very hungry to get an international match. I know what happens in team meetings when someone makes a comeback to the team. How light banter happens and I am very excited about those things also. Whenever I get that opportunity, I am going to go all-in for sure.Yes, I have grown up a lot in last few months. The way that I now look at this game... my perception about this game is very different from what I had before. The banter would continue... but now I know where to stop so that it doesn't disturb my game. I am in a more mature headspace now and the break taught me a lot about it. I was spending the most quality time of my life.(banter will always happen) but I feel you need to have that line where you understand now it's done and you have to get back to your focus zone and just think about your game.I think feel to. My dad is someone who doesn't share a lot of things about what he is feeling. I know he is happy now. There was a time when he was very worried. As a sportsperson, I know when you take some decisions then people around you, who love you, will get hurt. Primarily because they wouldn't know the reason behind it and your plan behind it.And I think this is what helps you become a man from a boy...when you start taking your calls and you know what's important for you at a particular point. Everything is good now, dad is also happy about the calls I am taking because he also knows it's not going to be easy for me. The comeback is not going to be easy, my dad knows that. They are very happy right now, very cheerful and very excited about the future. I am also excited about the future because now you know",Ishan Kishan was named in India A squad for tour of Australia.

NEW DELHI: New Zealand achieved a historic first Test series victory in India with a 113-run win in the second Test, ending the hosts' 12-year unbeaten streak. This victory also marked New Zealand's first series win on Indian soil.After securing the first Test in Bengaluru by eight wickets, New Zealand defeated India in the second Test in Pune by 113 runs, taking an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series.This series win halted India’s impressive run of 18 consecutive home series victories, which had lasted since Alastair Cook ’s England clinched a famous 2-1 triumph in December 2012.New Zealand veteran pacer Tim Southee expressed the team's satisfaction with their historic win against India. With 104 Tests and 385 wickets to his name, Southee noted that their achievement sends a message to other teams worldwide that it is ""possible"" to defeat a strong team like India on their home turf.""Yeah, I think you just look at the history. What is it, 12 years that someone's been able to do it and 18 series or whatever it is. It's a very, very tough place to come. I think if you look at it from my perspective and the cricket I've played in the past however many years, I think you look at India and Australia as probably the two most difficult places to tour. Both the conditions, the quality of the opposition, and how good they are at home make it a tough place to tour,"" Southee told Cricbuzz.""But I think you look at this one in particular, 12 years, 18 series.

NEW DELHI: Star batter Smriti Mandhana has set a new benchmark in Indian women’s cricket , surpassing the legendary Mithali Raj to become the Indian player with the most ODI centuries .Mandhana, known for her elegant stroke play and aggressive approach, achieved this feat with her eighth century, overtaking Raj’s record of seven, during the third ODI against New Zealand women at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad on Tuesday.Known for her powerful stroke play and elegance at the crease, Mandhana’s innings have often provided India with strong starts or vital innings at crucial moments. Her ability to build big scores has set her apart as one of the game’s finest batters.In the final match of the three-match ODI series, India secured a six-wicket victory over New Zealand, winning the series 2-1. Opener Mandhana (100 off 122 balls) delivered an outstanding performance, redeeming herself after subdued performances in the previous two matches.Just behind Mandhana is Mithali, a legendary figure in Indian cricket. With 7 centuries to her name, Mithali’s approach was marked by precision, patience, and technical prowess. Her career spanned over two decades, and during this time, she not only held together India’s middle order but also inspired countless young cricketers. Her impact on Indian women’s cricket is undeniable, and her seven centuries stand as a testament to her enduring skill and resilience.Next is current ODI skipper Harmanpreet Kaur, known for her aggressive batting and match-winning knocks. With 6 ODI centuries, she has often taken on the role of a game-changer, particularly in high-stakes situations. Her ability to counterattack and play under pressure has made her one of the most exciting players in the lineup.Also notable is Punam Raut, who has quietly carved a place with her steady approach, accumulating 3 centuries. Each of these players has contributed uniquely to India's journey in women’s cricket, creating a formidable legacy for future generations.","Smriti Mandhana overtakes the legendary Mithali Raj to become the Indian player with the most ODI centuries.

BRIEF SCORES:

NAGPUR: The man playing his 100th First Class match triggered the Uttarakhand collapse. A youngster, billed to fill in the shoes of the milestone man, soon joined in and posted his career-best bowling figures. Together, the two gave Vidarbha a big win in Dehradun on Tuesday.The collapse, engineered by Akshay Wakhare and Harsh Dubey , saw Uttarakhand fold at just 71 in 21.2 overs. Vidarbha posted a crushing 266-win, their third of the season, to consolidate their top position in Elite Group ‘B’ with 18 points.The end of the Uttarakhand innings was sudden, almost unbelievable. The top three in the Uttarakhand batting lineup added a meagre 3 runs to the scoreboard in 51 balls. The last 4 wickets were gone in seven balls, for just 2 runs.It’s difficult to gauge if the Vidarbha bowlers dished out unplayable stuff or Uttarakhand batters lost a mental battle. Perhaps, it was a bit of both, and more. Chasing a 338-run target on the last day can be a daunting task. The Day 4 pitch at Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Dehradun, though, wasn’t as roughed up to warrant the collapse.Wakhare, starting the Vidarbha attack, bowled a maiden first up. In his second, again a maiden over, offie Wakhare accounted for opener Avneesh Sudha. Next over, Aditya Thakare, who had not conceded a run till then, removed opener Vaibhav Bhatt for a duck.By the sixth over, Uttarakhand were 2 down for 2 runs when Wakhare — with his spell reading 3-2-1-1 — was taken off the attack. Dubey, replacing Wakhare, removed skipper Samarth R as Uttarakhand slid to 8 for 3 wickets in 8.3 overs.As Uttarakhand stared down the barrel, Yuvraj Choudhary, the No. 5 southpaw batter, adopted the hit out or get out approach. Choudhary (38;21b) hit 5 sixes, all off Dubey. The blitzkrieg helped Uttarakhand reach 53 for 3 in 15 overs.With Choudhary blazing all guns, Wakahre was brought back into the attack in the 14th over. After starting his second spell with a maiden, Wakhare struck on the first ball of the 16th over to send Choudharyback. .The Choudhary dismissal proved to be the beginning of the end of the Uttarakhand inning. Dubey, who had conceded 34 runs in four overs for one wicket till then, picked up two more — Kunal Chandela (13;40b;2x4) and Aditya Tare (0;1b) — in his fifth.There was no stopping Dubey after that. Post lunch, Dubey struck thrice in the 21st over of the Uttarakhand inning — accounting for Abhay Negi, Mayank Mishra and Deepak Dhapola. In the next over, Wakhare ended the rival inning with Swapnil Singh's wicket — his seventh of the match. Dubey, with 6 for 38, posted the best figures of his 11-match First Class career.Vidarbha 326 all out in 88 overs & 300 all out in 75 overs (Dhruv Shorey 59, Yash Rathod 56, Danish Malewar 42, Akshay Karnewar 31; Swapnil Singh 5 for 97; Deepak Dhapola 2 for 21, Mayank Mishra 2 for 82) beat Uttarakhand 289 all out in 107.2 overs & 71 all out in 21.2 overs (Yuvraj Choudhary 38; Harsh Dubey 6 for 38, Akshay Wakhare 3 for 17, Aditya Thakare 1 for 7) by 266 runs.Player of the Match: Yash Rathod","Vidarbha posted a crushing 266-win, their third of the season, to consolidate their top position in Elite Group ‘B’ with 18 points.

Brief Scores:

Jharkhand proved to be no match for the visitors throughout their Round 3 Ranji Trophy encounter in Jamshedpur as Chandigarh clinched the tie by 10 wickets to go top of Group D table on Tuesday.Starting the final day at Keenan Stadium on 28/3, the hosts could add just 102 runs to their second innings and set Chandigarh a meagre target of 43 runs to win as the visiting bowlers put up an allround show. And, riding their winning momentum, Chandigarh mustered the target in just 3.3 overs to finish the game on 45 for no loss.The 10-wicket victory earned the Manan Vohra-led side seven points to take them to 13 points from three matches. Jharkhand, on the other end, failed to earn any point from the four-day game to stay on fifth spot with six points from the three fxitures they have played so far.Earlier, the bowling trio of Nishunk Birla (3-17), Vishu Kashyap (3-46) and Raj Bawa (3-33) claimed three wickets each as Chandigarh, which had also garnered the first-innings lead, demolished any effort from Jharkhand to force a comeback on Day 4.The hosts’ debutant opener, Sharandeep Singh (64), was the only batter on the day to put up any resistance against the Chandigarh bowlers and hit his maiden half-century in a bid to carry his team’s cause. His partnership of 79 runs with skipper Virat Singh (30) for the fifth wicket was the only bright spot for the home side.However, the dismissals of Sharandeep and Virat in the space of just 12 balls and just 2 runs put paid to any of the hosts’ hopes to script a draw. Wicketkeeper-batter Robin Minz — also making his debut for Jharkhand — added 16 more runs with his bat to take the total to 130 as wickets kept tumbling at the other end.Later, Chandigarh openers Arslan Khan (25) and Shivam Bhambri (19) helped their team to a consecutive win without any hiccups on the way.Jharkhand 201 and 130 in 50.3 overs (Sharandeep Singh 64, Virat Singh 30; Nishunk Birla 3 for 17, Vishu Kashyap 3 for 46, Raj Bawa 3 for 33).

Brief Scores:

AHMEDABAD: Opener and vice-captain Smriti Mandhana (100 off 122 balls; 10x4) answered questions about her form with a timely century as India chased down a 233- run target with six wickets to spare in the third and final ODI against New Zealand here on Tuesday.With meaningful contributions from captain Harmanpreet Kaur (59 not out; 63b; 6x4), No. 3 Yastika Bhatia (35; 49b; 4x4) and finishing touches from Jemimah Rodrigues (22; 18b; 4x4), the hosts chased down the target in 44.2 overs to take the series 2-1.India’s pursuit of 233 commenced with Shafali Verma striking two exquisite boundaries before she was caught down the leg side by Isabella Gaze off pacer Hannah Rowe. However, Mandhana and Bhatia batted in a composed manner, rotating the strike and hitting the odd bad ball for boundaries as India reached 40 for 1 in the first 10 overs.Mandhana’s first boundary came off the 27th delivery she faced while Bhatia got off the mark with a straight drive off Lea Tahuhu. Smriti lofted Eden Carson for a boundary over mid off before Yastika smashed the same bowler over extra cover for another four. Bhatia then hit Sophie Devine straight down the ground before spooning a catch back to the bowler off the next ball.Harmanpreet and Smriti's partnership started off slowly but eventually all the bowlers bore the brunt of their hitting prowess. Devine was struck for three boundaries while left-arm spinner Fran Jonas and pacer Rowe were smashed to all parts of the ground.Smriti was bowled just after she completed her hundred, off Rowe’s scrambled seam delivery. Jemimah's cameo, in which she struck four exquisite boundaries, was cut short by Jonas, who trapped her in front.Earlier, India had New Zealand in a spot of bother, first at 36 for 3 and then again at 88 for 5, but the White Ferns added 144 runs for the last five wickets to reach 232 in 49.5 overs.India 236 for 4 (Mandhana 100, Harmanpreet 59; Rowe 2 for 47) beat New Zealand 232 (Halliday 86, Deepti 3 for 39, Mishra 2 for 41) by 6 wickets.","Opener and vice-captain Smriti Mandhana (100 off 122 balls; 10x4) answered questions about her form with a timely century.

MUMBAI: Delhi seamer Harshit Rana was called up on Tuesday to bowl in the India nets ahead of the third Test against New Zealand at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai, which kicks off on Friday.Rana was recently named in India’s 18-member squad for the upcoming Borde rGavaskar Trophy in Australia. The 22-year-old has impressed this season with both ball and bat, taking 5 for 80 and 2 for 61, and scoring a half-century (59) to lead Delhi to a 10-wicket win over Assam at the Arun Jaitley Stadium. However, TOI has confirmed with sources in the BCCI that Rana has not yet been included in the squad.Alongside the injured Mayank Yadav, Nitish Reddy and Prasidh Krishna, Rana was chosen as a reserve for India’s three-match Test series against New Zealand. All the reserve pacers bowled in the nets before the first Test in Bengaluru.“Washington Sundar was added to the squad before the second Test after a meeting among selectors. No such meeting has happened regarding Rana. Realistically, one pacer out of Mohammed Siraj and Akashdeep Singh will partner Jasprit Bumrah, along with three spinners in the eleven. Rana was picked as a reserve bowler for the New Zealand series. With the next Ranji match starting on November 6, he can bowl in the India nets for a couple of days before joining the Delhi squad. As of now, he hasn’t been included in the squad,” a source told TOI.If not included in the main squad, the seamer is likely to fly to Chandigarh for Delhi’s next Ranji match.Known for his all-round abilities, Rana was close to making his debut in the Zimbabwe T20I series in July but missed out. Rana’s pace and precision caught the selectors’ eye, earning him a place in India’s T20I squad against Bangladesh, though he did not get a game.Meanwhile, KL Rahul, who was dropped from the second Test, trained at the Wankhede Stadium on Tuesday alongside wicketkeeper-batsman Dhruv Jurel.","Harshit Rana called up to bowl in India nets ahead of third Test against New Zealand.

Kolkata: For the second successive match, Bengal and Kerala had to be content with just one point each in their rain-affected Ranji Trophy Elite Group ‘C’ game at JU’s Salt Lake campus ground here that ended in a dull draw on Tuesday.Not even the first innings of both the sides could be completed in the match in which only seven sessions of play was possible after a washout on the first day. The result saw Karnataka, who beat Bihar, overtake Bengal on the points table as the latter slipped to the fourth spot with five points from three matches.Kerala declared their innings at 356 for nine, half-an-hour before lunch, leaving Bengal to get those runs in a minimum of 78 overs (63 + 15 mandatory overs) in just over two sessions of play. However, the hosts did not find it prudent to go for the chase and preferred to just play out the sessions getting 181 for the loss of three wickets when bad lights stopped play before the start of the mandatory overs.Bengal openers Shuvam Dey and Sudip Chatterjee negated any chance of Kerala pressing for the first-innings lead by stitching together a 101-run partnership in 31 overs. Debutant Dey played a cautious knock without trying any heroics. Chatterjee continued his good form and managed to find the occasional boundaries too. Both the batters got their fifties before seasoned campaigner Jalaj Saxena provided the breakthrough by having Chatterjee trapped in front for a well-made 57 that came off 102 balls with the help of nine boundaries as Bengal went into the tea break at 123 for one in 37 overs.Dey hit the only six of Bengal innings before being stumped by Mohammed Azharuddeen off Aditya Sarwate for 67. The left-arm spinner struck again when he had another debutant Avlin Ghosh trapped in front for four.But skipper Anushtup Majumder joined hands with Sudip Gharami to keep the Kerala attack at bay. Visiting skipper Sachin Baby used seven bowlers but failed to get any more breakthroughs. The two were involved in an unbroken 43-run stand as the contest dragged on without much purpose in the last session of play.Earlier in the morning overnight unbeaten batter Salma Nizar continued to frustrate Bengal attack as he stayed undefeated on a polished 95 facing 265 deliveries and hitting eight fours and one six. Man of the match Ishan Porel ended with six for 103.Brief scores: Kerala 356/9 declare in 120 overs. Bengal 181/3 in 63 overs (Shuvam Dey 67, Sudip Chatterjee 57). Match drawn.

The duo stitched together a crucial 76-run partnership for the second wicket, steadying the Indian innings.Bhatia played the perfect foil to Mandhana, scoring a brisk 35 runs before falling to a return catch.Mandhana's partnership with captain Harmanpreet Kaur proved decisive, effectively sealing the match for India.Their 118-run stand for the third wicket deflated the New Zealand bowling attack, with Kaur playing a supporting role with an unbeaten 59.By the time Mandhana departed in the 41st over, India were within touching distance of victory.Earlier in the day, New Zealand recovered from a precarious 88/5 to post a respectable total of 232/5, thanks to a fighting knock of 86 runs from Brooke Halliday.The Indian bowlers, led by Deepti Sharma and Priya Mishra , had initially dominated the proceedings, reducing New Zealand to a moderate total.Despite the late fightback from New Zealand, Mandhana's century proved to be the difference between the two sides.",India beat New Zealand by six wickets to win three-match ODI series.

Brief Scores

Gujarat 335 and 314/9 in 101 overs (Umang Kumar 153 not out, Jaymeet Patel 82; Manan Hingrajia 33; Ajay Singh Kukna 5-107, Aniket Choudhary 3-37, Arafat Khan 1-65) drew with Rajasthan 319 (Abhijeet Tomar 77, Ajay Singh Kukna 47, Jaymeet Patel 3-26, Arzan Nagwaswalla 3-99, Chintan Gaja 2-42).

JAIPUR: Breaking a long sequence of fifties, Umang Kumar slammed a maiden century as the Ranji Trophy match between Rajasthan and Gujarat ended in a tame draw at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium on Tuesday.In a pre-Diwali celebration, Umang produced a wide range of fireworks from his willow to accomplish his career’s highest score with an unbeaten 153.Thanks to Umang’s marathon innings, Gujarat piled up 314 for 9 in their second innings. The visitors opted for batting practice rather than going for an outright win on the fourth and final day on the placid track. With no result in sight, both the captains decided to call off the match just before the tea-time.Gujarat bagged three points on the basis of their 16-run first innings lead, while hosts settled for a solitary point. After the end of the third-round fixtures, Vidarbha led the Elite Group B with 18 points, followed closely by Gujarat (15). Rajasthan (10) slipped to the fourth spot as Himachal Pradesh jumped to the third position with 14 points to their credit.With only two teams qualifying for the knockouts from each group, Deepak Hooda-led side will have to improve their performance by a few notches up to make the cut.When Gujarat resumed at their overnight score of 129/4, the hosts were hoping against hope to wrap up the visiting side as quickly as possible and go for the target.However, Umang and Jaymeet Patel shattered their hopes with a gutsy display of batting to frustrate the home team. Umang and Jaymeet Patel, who were batting on 44 and 25, respectively on Monday evening, continued from where they had left to add 153 for the fifth wicket.By the time Jaymeet (82: 140, 10x4) departed the match was over for Rajasthan. Umang romped to his hundred off an excellent boundary to the mid-wicket fence off Arafat Khan. The diminutive batter jumped in joy and punched the air in wild celebration after reaching the milestone.Even though wickets were tumbling at the other end, the 23-year-old Umang kept scoring runs at will to reach the 150-run mark. Rajasthan left-arm spinner Ajay Singh Kukna bagged a five-wicket haul, while Aniket Choudhary claimed 3 for 37. Seamer Arafat Khan chipped in with a wicket.The Daman-based cricketer was ecstatic after the match.“The big baggage is off my shoulder now. I scored seven half-centuries and came quite close on a couple of occasions but couldn’t reach the three-figure mark. When I came to bat yesterday the match was hanging in balance. I am glad that due to my unbeaten ton, I helped my team come out with an honourable draw,” Umang told TOI on Tuesday.Jaymeet was adjudged as man-of-the match for his brilliant all-round performance. Even captain Chintan Gaja lauded the efforts of his young all-rounder.“Jaymeet’s deadly spell on the second day afternoon and his batting in crisis in both the innings was crucial in the ultimate outcome of the match. I am also happy for Umang for finally fulfilling his first century. We didn’t declare our second innings as we knew we can’t achieve a result on the flat track,” said Gaja.","Gujarat draw with Rajasthan in Ranji Trophy match at Sawai Mansingh Stadium.

You need to get to a situation for luck to play a role: Arjun Kadhe,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/you-need-to-get-to-a-situation-for-luck-to-play-a-role-arjun-kadhe/articleshow/114661630.cms,"Arjun Kadhe

PUNE: It was his grandparents who sowed the seeds for Arjun Kadhe ’s career as a professional tennis player.More than two decades ago, when Arjun was taking baby steps in tennis, his paternal grandfather decided to sell their house and set aside the proceeds exclusively to help his grandson follow a dream.“I remember when I was eight years old … at that point we were not financially so super to think about tennis as a viable option for my career. But my granddad had a vision. He told me, ‘Okay, I will do anything. You just play tennis, you want to represent India, you want to play a Grand Slam ’. My parents were living on rent. It was unbelievable,” an emotional Kadhe, 30, said as he jogged his memory back.All the sacrifices, of his and of those around him, and the years of tireless pursuit of excellence bore fruit last week when Arjun claimed his first ATP Tour doubles title , in partnership with Rithvik Choudary at the Almaty Open in Kazakhstan last week.“The credit goes first to my parents, they've made huge sacrifices, then my coaches. Obviously, it's a team effort,” he said.""Obviously, Balu sir (coach M Balachandran) traveling with us, (former South African player) Raven (Klaasen) traveling with us, the Double Dream of India programme is helping us a lot.“And as you said, the journey is long, but it feels really, really good, because you get rewarded. In doubles you're playing 35 weeks alone on the road, and it can be really brutal sometimes.“So this win, we both want to take it in, get confidence, enjoy and go ahead again.”The Indian combination beat three teams ranked in the top-30 on the ATP Tour, including No. 13 pair Sadio Doumbia and Fabien Reboul of France in the second round.In a thriller of a final, Arjun and Rithvik saved five match points in the super tiebreak to beat Germany’s Jakob Schnaitter and Mark Wallner, ranked 26th, 3-6, 7-6 (3), 14-12. Remarkably, the Indians won only 68 points to their rivals’ 80 in the match.Arjun acknowledged that luck played its part in their win, but the team needed to work hard to get there in the first place.“I think luck played a big part. But at the same time, we were just talking, the coaches were telling us we lost two finals in the super tiebreak, where we were the better team, in the Challengers. As (personal coach) Hemant (Bendrey) sir was also saying, luck is there, but you have to get yourself into that situation for luck to play it out,” Arjun said.The Punekar, supported by Punit Balan group , rose to a career-high 77 in the individual doubles ranking after the win.“I'm really grateful that it has happened, but at the same time, I feel I was playing a good level,” he said.“It's about, you know, being there, giving yourself that chance, getting rejected, at some point it will come.“It's not in your hands when that click comes. For some people, it comes early. If they can sustain it, they move to the next level.“Some people get rejected, and get that breakthrough. It's about working hard and trying to improve, and take the next step. Everyone has their own journey, in my opinion.“I feel we deserve it, because I truly believe we have the level. Now it's about going the long way and trying to improve every day and not be satisfied with this one tournament.”Arjun had partnered Rithvik in the latter half of last season but parted ways at the start of 2024. Even before they combined, the Telangana lad had mentioned to Arjun of his desire to play with his previous partner Niki Poonacha whenever he decided to focus on doubles. So, the Maharashtra player was understandably cautious when Rithvik reached out to him in the middle of this season.“I feel like every challenge brings opportunity. At that point (when Rithvik chose to go back to Niki at the start of 2024), I was like, ‘oh my God. we are doing well, blah, blah, blah, what is happening?’ But then, if I look back now, I won (two Challenger) titles (with Jeevan Nedunchezhiyan and Anirudh Chandrasekar),” Arjun said.“So it was really good for me.”This time around, Arjun said, the two were in for the long haul. And long-term partnership is something he strongly believes in.“To develop a good team, you need time,” he said, “because if you keep switching partners, the first few weeks of understanding how we want to play, understanding how my partner wants us to play in the future, what is our best?“For all that to align it takes a little bit of time, and in doubles you have super tiebreak. Sometimes you are winning from (facing) match points, sometimes losing from match points.”The Almaty title had given a pleasant surprise for both Arjun and Rithvik in terms of ranking jump — the latter had broken into the top-100 for the first time in his career, reaching 85 in the ATP charts.That means they will now give it a shot to make the Australian Open cut before closing the season.“Now it's about planning it smartly, taking care of your body, because it's the end of the year, you don't want to overplay,” he said.“If we want to be top-50 in the world, we need to improve a lot. We won this tournament, but those teams are doing so many things better than us. So, it’s important also to play the big events, lose, and then realize this is where we are at.“So, we are not thinking too far ahead, just trying to think next week. How can we try and make Australia? If we don't make it, we still have to try and make French.“The plan will go forward from there.”","Arjun Kadhe claims his first ATP Tour doubles title with Rithvik Choudary at Almaty Open in Kazakhstan. The 30-year-old rose to a career-high 77 in the individual doubles ranking after the win. Arjun acknowledged that luck played its part in their win, but the team needed to work hard.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114661721,imgsize-157286,width-400,resizemode-4/114661721.jpg"
My fighting spirit helped me win my first ITF title: Tanisha Kashyap,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/my-fighting-spirit-helped-me-win-my-first-itf-title-tanisha-kashyap/articleshow/114554193.cms,"Tanisha Kashyap in action during the $15,000 ITF women's tennis event in Bengaluru last week. (Photo Credit: KSLTA/Deepthi Indukuri)

For Tanisha Kashyap , 22, the $15,000 ITF title in Bengaluru last week will remain special for many reasons, not least because it's her first one on the pro circuit.""This one's really special because it's in my home country, in India, and it's something that I've waited for a while,"" Tanisha said.""I'm really glad how I performed in the week I was actually injured. I had a neck catch which led to my shoulders because of the continuous matches that I played.""And it was tough each and every match to play with that pain, but I managed it really well. Mentally, I stayed strong and I relied on my fitness to win this title.""Tanisha, world ranked 868, overcame Akanksha Nitture 6-7 (5), 6-1, 6-1 in the final of the hard court event.The triumph was made all the more memorable by the difficult start to the season wherein she was rendered out of action for three months after undergoing a ""mini surgery"" to treat a meniscus and ACL tear.Tanisha suffered the injury during an event in Monastir, Tunisia, in early April. She was leading in the second set against Finland'sAnastasia Kulikova , a former top-200 player with nine pro titles, when she felt pain but played through it. It was only the following day when she underwent scan, she discovered the full extent of the injury.""I cannot disclose what treatment I got, because I was treated by (Daniil) Medvedev's doctor … (I was) set back for three to four weeks,"" she said.""I was completely off from tennis. I was on crutches. I didn't play for three-four (sic) months. I was just building back my fitness and building the strength of my knee and everything.""So I would say this year has been tough, mentally, physically, and I had to face a lot adversities in the beginning because it was not looking that great.""But through it all, I stayed positive and didn't lose sight of my goal. I worked hard each and every day to build myself back up from injury … to get to where I'm right now, to lift my first pro title.""The time away from action and the subsequent comeback helped her understand her game better.""When I did start, it was also very tough, because when you start to play tournaments, you're trying to figure it out again because there's some pain or there's a certain movement that's bothering you.""So you have to find out, you have to go back and do therapy. It was a process to figure it out and to also strengthen my quads back up to support my knee. So, it was tough.""But, sometimes when there's a lot of chaos, when you have a lot of time, you can really think about tennis from an outside perspective, and you get to know yourself better.""Tunisia seems to be Tanisha's favourite hunting ground, at least this year, and it was for a reason.""The best probable reason why I frequently played in Monastir (is) because I've been boarding in All In Tennis Academy (in France), and it's very close,"" she said.""It's not that expensive to travel, not much of jet lag. And the level of the tournaments in Monastir are way, way, much higher than other places.""And I was still fresh off an injury. If you're injured and suddenly go to Thailand, what do you do? You go to Indonesia, you spend all that money for two weeks and you might not perform well.""It was in Monastir while she was finding her way back in July that she first felt a catch in the neck, which forced her to retire from a $15K event in the second round when she was leading 6-2, 4-1 against Spaniard Victoria Gomez O'Hayon.It was the same issue that cropped up in Bengaluru at the very start of the tournament, and she showed tremendous grit to play through the pain and obvious discomfort it put her in.""Right before my first round, in a certain movement, I jerked it, and I had the same neck catch again,"" she said.""I couldn't look up, I couldn't look to my right, I couldn't serve. And I think throughout this tournament, I had so many double faults. I'm sure the statistics are there.""It taught me something. I stayed strong, I battled each and every point. I ran for each and every shot. I didn't, you know, let anything go. So, that fighting spirit really helped me win this tournament.""And, of course, some strategy here and there, and to play smart tennis.""Smart tennis she did have to play in the final which lasted two hours and 19 minutes.""I knew that I had limited range of motion, and I knew that I couldn't blast my first serves, how I was blasting in Mysuru or before. So I knew that I had to tennis wise, play smart, and place the ball and start off the point and stay in the rallies for my match.""For sure, the neck started to act during the first set, which lasted more than an hour and a half. She delivered nine double faults in the opener, compared to just one for the remainder of the match.""When I was four or five down, my neck started to really catch again, and it was really extremely painful. So I had no other option to call the physio,"" Tanisha said.""The second and third, I took a breather. I just kind of meditated and focused on my game strategy … to place the balls away from her striking zone and to make her work for each and every point.And maybe she wasn't expecting, maybe she thought that I would be tired out and I wouldn't fight back. But I've always been a fighter, and I stayed strong mentally and just stayed in it, and I let her make the errors.""I was calm and cool. I can't explain it, but you know, I just went into my zone.""Tanisha has been mainly coached by her father Suresh Kalita. But she had worked with former Davis Cupper Vishaal Uppal and Billie Jean King Cup player Rushmi Chakravarthi among other coaches. She also had a short stint at the JC Ferrero Tennis Academy in Spain before heading to the Ohio State University to play college tennis.Having seen her share of tennis abroad, the Assam native believes that while the ""commitment level and fitness level"" were the areas where Indian players lagged, it was not necessary that they had to relocate to elsewhere to make the breakthrough.""We can definitely do that here as well. Like I said, it depends on the individual and how much they want to do it.""They might be doing the same exercises that the Europeans are doing, but it's not up to the standard that the Europeans are doing. In the sense, the effort, the physical ability, how much you are pushing yourself.""I've always believed that it's an individual's choice. And, there are some great tennis coaches, fitness coaches here. But in the end of the day, it's how hard you push yourself.""As for herself, Tanisha is not ready to rest on her Bengaluru laurels.""""This is just the beginning of something,"" she said, ""it's a good achievement, but I'm looking for more. I'm gonna get back to train and recover, to win some more, hopefully soon.""It's just one of the small stepping stones towards the bigger picture and the bigger goal.""","Tanisha Kashyap, 22, won the $15,000 ITF title in Bengaluru last week.

At times, Nitture had no answers to the 19-year-old’s powerful groundstrokes.“The rain interruption broke the momentum, which I had gained till then, to a certain extent,” said Nitture, who fired nine aces in the semifinal contest.Adkar, who was down with Chikungunya a couple of weeks back, struggled physically in the decider. Despite her best efforts to finish points early, she lacked energy while Nitture used the court well and took a 4-1 lead, which was more or less curtains for the second seed.","Akanksha Nitture beat second-seeded Vaishnavi Adkar 7-5, 3-6, 6-2. The match lasted two hours and 18 minutes. The 21-year-old will take on Tanisha Kashyap, who beat Carolann Delaunay.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114389584,imgsize-30762,width-400,resizemode-4/114389584.jpg"
