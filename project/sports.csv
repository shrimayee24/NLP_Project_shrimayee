Kevin Durant sidelined again after injury return



In the world of basketball, standout performances rarely go unnoticed, especially when a rising star catches the eye of one of the NBA ’s greatest. That’s exactly what happened when Kevin Durant took notice of Mikaylah Williams , a breakout talent from LSU. Williams, who has been making waves in women’s college basketball, put on an incredible show against Stanford, leading her team to a thrilling 94-88 win. Her performance not only showcased her scoring ability but also her efficiency, hitting an impressive 66.6% from the field. Naturally, Durant couldn’t resist acknowledging her skills, offering his praise in a way only a true basketball aficionado could.Kevin Durant recently shared his thoughts on rising women's college basketball star Mikaylah Williams after her stellar performance against the Stanford Cardinal . Williams, playing for LSU, led her team to a thrilling 94-88 victory, nearly securing a double-double with an impressive 32 points and 9 rebounds. Her shooting was nothing short of spectacular, hitting 66.6% from the field.Durant, clearly impressed by the young star's performance, took to social media to give her a well-deserved shoutout. Reposting highlights of Williams' standout game on X (formerly Twitter), KD offered his own praise, making sure her remarkable feat didn’t go unnoticed.""Everything pure."" (via: Sportskeeda)Kevin Durant is widely regarded as one of the most deadly shooters the NBA has ever seen, with a keen eye for great shooting mechanics. So, when Mikaylah Williams started knocking down shots, it didn’t take long for KD to take notice. Her shooting prowess caught the attention of one of the best in the game, proving that great shooters always recognize talent.Also Read: Franz Wagner's injury shatters Magic fans after Paolo Banchero's similar setback Kevin Durant’s injury woes have hit thePhoenix Suns hard once again. After making his return on November 26 to face the LA Lakers, Durant was forced to leave the game early following an ankle sprain in Tuesday’s match against the San Antonio Spurs. The setback kept him on the sidelines after just 16 minutes of play, raising fresh concerns about his availability moving forward.This latest injury leaves the Suns at a critical juncture. With a 12-9 record, they currently sit in seventh place in the competitive Western Conference, but Durant’s absence could see them slide further down the standings. His injury also contributed to Phoenix’s recent loss to the New Orleans Pelicans, where the team had to battle without their star forward.Despite the setback, the Suns can lean on their dynamic duo of Devin Booker and Bradley Beal . Durant, when healthy, has been a powerhouse, averaging 25.8 points, 6.7 rebounds, 3.1 assists, and 1.5 blocks per game this season. His performance has shown he’s still in top form, but without his versatile presence on the court, the team may struggle to maintain consistency over the long haul.The key question now is how long Durant will be sidelined. If his re-evaluation next week reveals a more serious issue, the Suns may be forced to cope without him for an extended period, potentially altering their playoff aspirations.","Mikaylah Williams, a rising star in women's college basketball, put on an incredible show against Stanford.

India's

WTC final

qualification scenarios

NEW DELHI: A timid surrender from the Indian team led to Australia's massive 10-wicket win in the pink-ball Test at Adelaide on Sunday.On a high from the victory in the series opener in Perth, Team India hit a nadir in the day-night battle against the Aussies as the game was done and dusted inside seven sessions -- just over two days.With the mauling India received against a dominant Australia, the visitors' chances of qualifying for the World Test Championship (WTC) final took a serious hit.Sitting at the top of the WTC table before the Adelaide Test, the defeat for India meant that they slipped to the third spot.The heavy defeat in Adelaide means India's percentage points slipped from 61.11 to 57.29 as the third placed Australia swapped places with them, boosting their percentage points from 57.69 to 60.71.South Africa sit at the second position with 59.26 percentage points after 5 wins in 9 Tests.After the loss in Adelaide, the Indian team now cannot afford another defeat in the remaining three Tests of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy series, if they are to outrightly qualify for the WTC final.With the series level at 1-1, India now have to eye a series win with a 4-1 scoreline if they were to qualify for the WTC final without depending on other results.If India register a 4-1 series win from here, Rohit Sharma and Co. can get to 146 points and 64.05 PCT, which currently top-placed Australia won't be able to overhaul. But winning three Tests straight Down Under will be a massive challenge for the Indian side.If India win series 3-1 - supposing they draw one and win two of their next three matches, they will finish at 138 points and a PCT of 60.52. In that case, Australia can only get to 57 PCT. But Australia then have 2 matches against Sri Lanka remaining to get back into the top two of the WTC table. In case of a 3-1 series win, India destiny won't be entirely in their hands as it will keep the doors open for South Africa as well.If India beat Australia 3-2 in series - the case where India win 2 of their next three matches and lose one more, they will finish with 134 points and a PCT of 58.77.That will then keep South Africa in the hunt for the WTC final spot as they still have a Test against Sri Lanka and two more matches against Pakistan at home to pip India on percentage points.In this case, India will need Sri Lanka's assistance to make it to the WTC final as the Islanders will have to beat Australia in at least one, if not two, matches at home. The two Sri Lanka vs Australia Tests are scheduled in Galle.",India's chances of qualifying for World Test Championship final took a serious hit. India's percentage points slipped from 61.11 to 57.29 as the third placed Australia swapped places with them.

NEW DELHI: The fiery dismissal of Travis Head by Mohammed Siraj in the second Test sparked a storm on social media, with cricket fans and pundits weighing in on the dramatic exchange that followed.Siraj, known for his aggressive bowling and animated celebrations, delivered a perfect yorker to dismantle Head’s stumps on Saturday during the day-night Test at Adelaide.The moment escalated when Siraj approached Head with a fiery send-off, prompting boos from the Adelaide crowd and stirring heated debates online.Reactions poured in, with many criticizing Siraj’s behaviour as unsportsmanlike.A section of fans labelled the gesture disrespectful, with one comment reading, “Siraj, you’re a disgrace to yourself, Test cricket and your country.”Others argued that such aggression is part of the competitive spirit of the game.Some voiced support for Head, who had been pivotal with a stellar 140-run knock featuring 17 boundaries and four sixes.However, Indian fans were quick to defend Siraj, citing Head’s formidable history against India as justification for the bowler’s intensity.Head’s match-winning performances in high-pressure games, including his pivotal 137 in the ODI World Cup final, once again made the headlines.“I said, ‘Well bowled,’ but he thought otherwise when he pointed me to the sheds. Slightly disappointed with the way that transpired. It is what it is. If they want to react like that, and if that’s how they want to represent themselves, then so be it.” Head, explaining the Siraj incident, told broadcasters Fox Sports at the end of the day's play.""I don't want to give too much air to him (Siraj). I feel like going out and playing the game I would like,"" Head told reporters in the post-day conference. ""I would also like to stand up for myself. I would like to think that in our team we wouldn't do that, and that's how I like to play the game. I feel like my teammates are the same.""",Mohammed Siraj's fiery dismissal of Travis Head sparks a storm on social media.

NEW DELHI: A technical glitch hilariously made India pacer Mohammed Siraj world's fastest bowler on Friday as the speed gun saw him clocking an astonishing 181.6 kmph on the opening day of the second Test against Australia in Adelaide.On the day that saw 11 wickets falling, an Indian collapse, a solid Nathan McSweeney-Marnus Labuschagne stand and rising tempers, the Siraj speed blunder from the broadcasters late in third session also hogged the limelight.Also See: IND vs AUS 2nd Test Day 2 Live Score The rare and bizarre incident happened in the 25th over of the Australian innings, when Siraj fired in rising back of a length delivery outside off, which Marnus Labuschagne glided down to deep backward point for a boundary.However, soon after the delivery was completed, the bottom of the screen showed that Siraj had clocked a record 181.6 kph ball.The blunder was instantly caught by the fans and led to a meme fest on social media.Pakistan speed merchant Shoaib Akhtar currently holds the record of bowling the fastest ball ever in cricket.He fired in a stunning 161.3 kph (100.23 mph) ball against England during the 2003 World Cup in Cape Town, South Africa.Australia ended the day at 86 for one in reply to India's 180 all out in the first innings on the opening day of the Pink-ball Test.After a fiery Mitchell Starc career-best figures of 6 for 48 restricted India to 180 all out, McSweeney and Labuschagne's unbeaten 62-run stand for the second wicket helped Australia take the opening day's honours.For India, Jasprit Bumrah was the lone wicket-taker on Day 1.Australia trailed by 94 runs at the close of play.","India pacer Mohammed Siraj clocked 181.6 kmph on the speed gun on the opening day of the second Test against Australia in Adelaide.

NEW DELHI: India suffered an embarrassing 10-wicket defeat in just over two days in the day-night Test in Adelaide as Australia levelled the Border-Gavaskar Trophy series 1-1.After the highs of Perth, where they won by 295 runs, India nosedived in the Pink-ball game, succumbing to their quickest defeat against Australia.While the batters flopped in both the innings, India bowlers also disappointed as Australia raked in 337 in their first innings and took a decisive 157-run lead. Pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah did manage early breakthroughs but lacked support from others as Travis Head ton put Australia on top.After India's overall poor outing in the second Test, former Pakistan cricketer Basit Ali has said that India needs speedster Mohammed Shami for the third Test to give a boost to the bowling attack.Shami, who has been playing domestic cricket after an year-long injury lay-off, is expected to be flown Down Under soon but the team management is not hurrying over his international return.""We are getting news that Shami will be going but might play from the fourth Test. There won't be any benefit if India plays Shami from the fourth Test. Send him now and play him the Brisbane Test. If you are calling him for Melbourne, then don't call him at all. India need Shami now! Your pace attack needs Shami,” Basit said on his YouTube channel.After the defeat in the second game, captain Rohit Sharma said that Shami had once again developed 'some swelling' in his knees after playing seven Mushtaq Ali Trophy games.On being asked if there is a chance for Shami's comeback in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, Rohit looked cautious with his answer.""No, no, definitely. That door is very much open. But we are just monitoring him because while playing Syed Mushtaq Ali T20, he again got some swelling in his knee, which obviously hampers his preparation to come and play a Test match.

We can get back in the game with a few tweaks: Ryan ten Doeschate

WELLINGTON: England's Joe Root etched his name into cricketing history by becoming the first English batter, and only the fourth in the world, to record 100 scores of fifty or more in Test cricket.The landmark achievement came during the second Test against New Zealand at the Basin Reserve on Saturday, when Root reached his 65th half-century in 76 balls during the third session of the second day’s play.Playing in his 151st Test match, Root’s remarkable feat places him among some of the game's greatest players. With 35 centuries and 65 fifties in 276 innings, the 33-year-old has accumulated a staggering 12,853 Test runs.Root now joins the elite company of Sachin Tendulkar Jacques Kallis , and Ricky Ponting , who are the only other players to surpass the 100 mark for 50+ scores in Test cricket. Tendulkar holds the record with 119, followed by Kallis and Ponting with 103 each.Root's achievement comes after a lean patch, where he struggled to find form following an impressive 262-run performance in Multan earlier this year. He endured a seven-innings streak without crossing the 50-run mark before his composed half-century in Wellington, which helped England seize a commanding position in the match.In addition to his historic 100th 50+ score, Root is now eyeing another significant milestone. With 1,417 Test runs in 2024, he needs just 83 more to become the second player in history to score 1,500 Test runs in multiple calendar years, a feat only Ricky Ponting has achieved, in 2003 and 2005. Root previously crossed the 1,500-run threshold in 2021 during his exceptional run of form.","Root becomes first English batter to record 100 scores of fifty or more in Test cricket.

'Vinod Kambli didn't have the talent ... ': Rahul Dravid’s old video goes viral,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/vinod-kambli-didnt-have-the-talent-rahul-dravids-old-video-goes-viral/articleshow/116065625.cms,"Vinod Kambli (Image credit: X)

India vs Australia: How pink ball is different

NEW DELHI: An old video of Rahul Dravid sharing his thoughts on 'talent', specifically mentioning Vinod Kambli , has resurfaced on social media, gaining renewed attention after recent footage of Kambli's public appearance.Kambli, a childhood friend of cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar , created a stir during his initial cricketing years but struggled to maintain his position at the top level. His international career, which began in 1991, included 104 ODIs and 17 Tests for India but lasted less than a decade.In the viral video, Dravid praised Kambli's ""incredible ball-striking ability"" while reflecting on potential shortcomings in other critical areas needed to succeed at the international level.""I think we judge talent wrong. What do we see as talent? And I've made the same mistake. We judge talent by people's ability to strike a cricket ball. The sweetness or the timing of a cricket ball. That's the only thing we see as talent. Things like determination, courage, discipline, and temperament are also talents. When we judging talent, I think we've got to look at the whole package,"" Dravid said in the video.""It's a hard thing to explain but some people just have the gift of timing and ball-striking. Sourav Ganguly just had that ability to time a cover drive. He just had it. You could see. Sachin has it. And Viru. You wouldn't say that about someone like Gautam (Gambhir) as much as you would do for some of these other guys. Not that Gautam is less successful. So that's what we see as talent. We don't actually look at the other side of talent. We say, a talented player didn't make it. We always look at this side but maybe he didn't have the other talents,"" Dravid elaborated.""I hate to use... but Vinod's probably been one of the nicest guys that I've met. Vinod had an incredible ball-striking ability. I remember a game in Rajkot, Vinod got 150 against (Javagal) Srinath and Anil (Kumble). It was incredible. First ball Anil came onto bowl, he hit him straight into the stone wall. In Rajkot, there used to be a stone wall. He hit it bang straight onto it. I mean, we were all shocked, wow it was amazing. How do you do that? But maybe he didn't have the talent in the other areas to understand what it took to be an international cricketer, to deal with the stress and the pressure. I can only guess but maybe Sachin had that much more. That's why Sachin is where he is today,"" Dravid concluded.Kambli scored 1084 runs in his 17-Test career at an impressive average of 54.20, which included four centuries and three fifties.In ODIs, he scored 2477 runs across 104 matches at an average of 32.59, with two centuries and 14 fifties to his name.",An old video of Rahul Dravid discussing 'talent' has resurfaced on social media.

Will Bill Belichick be a good fit for college coaching? Here's what Tom Brady had to say about this potential move,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/will-bill-belichick-be-a-good-fit-for-college-coaching-heres-what-tom-brady-had-to-say-about-this-potential-move/articleshow/116121910.cms,"Credit: Getty Images

Tom Brady Hilariously Shoots Down Bill Belichick's North Carolina Coaching Buzz



The speculation surrounding Bill Belichick’s potential move to college football, specifically as the head coach of the North Carolina Tar Heels, has taken the sports world by storm. The story broke four days ago, and it continues to be all the buzz: Could Belichick succeed Mack Brown? According to Diana Russini with The Athletic, the famous NFL coach would definitely take the position if offered, which makes it much more than just gossip. Amidst that, Tom Brady has his say on this rumored move.Notwithstanding that occasionally touchy subjects tackled, the three prominent former players of Belichick actually would include Tom Brady, Julian Edelman, and Rob Gronkowski, who have raised disbelief-not without humor. The trio has found reasons to believe Bilichick would not do well in the college football atmosphere on NFL on FOX.When asked if Belichick could adjust to coaching college football, Brady’s response was unequivocal: “No.” Edelman added an emphatic, “Absolutely not.” The discussion quickly turned comedic when Edelman pointed out the challenge of recruiting young players. ""Recruiting 18-year-olds?"" he remarked, sparking Brady to mimic Belichick’s typically blunt demeanor: “Listen, you really wanna come here? We don’t really want you anyway. I mean, I guess you could come, we’ll figure out if you can play.”Very witty comments that underline the fact that Belichick's decades-of experience snatching wins with authority might not be exactly a match in today's college football. Brady said that Belichick's example-making habit in team meetings has always set the tone for discipline in the team, a fact that perhaps would not resonate with contemporary college athletes who have found new leverage through NIL deals and transfer opportunities.Belichick's credentials in the NFL are nothing less than legendary. He is indeed the third-winningest coach in league history with a career record of 302-165, not to mention the six Super Bowl wins as head coach for the New England Patriots and contributions as defensive coordinator for that 1986 New York Giants' Super Bowl-winning team. He has earned his rightful place in the annals of football history by having the unmatched ability to build disciplined, professional teams.Whereas college football sometimes needs a bit of salesmanship, player grooming, and flexibility to quickly change most of the time, Belichick would bring an intelligence level to college football with respect to the game that would really be unmatched, and it would probably be something really difficult to make his fiery coaching style work within the nurturing atmosphere that college players usually expect.Also Read: Josh Allen makes NFL history with 6 TDs against Rams, strengthens MVP case despite narrow 44-42 loss Regardless of the buzz, most seem to think that Belichick will stay in the NFL. If his time were to end with the Patriots, he would be a top candidate in the next NFL coaching cycle. For teams looking for a proven winner, his gruff personality and tactical genius would far outweigh any weightiness given to his brusque demeanor. So while the college rumors are tantalizing, Belichick's legacy seems destined to stay professional.","Tom Brady, Julian Edelman, and Rob Gronkowski have raised disbelief over Bill Belichick's potential move to North Carolina.

ALBANY (BAHAMAS): Jay-tee! Jay-tee! Jaytee! The clubhouse crowd could not get enough as Justin Thomas caught up with overnight leader Scottie Scheffler with a birdie putt on the adjacent 9th green.It had seemed a toss-up between tournament host Tiger Woods ’ good friend and heir apparent as Thomas established a one-stroke lead over the defending champion at 17-under on a windswept day going into the final round, but a third contender threw his hat in the ring.The sub-plot almost became the main story at the Hero World Challenge .It wasn’t Akshay Bhatia, who found the water on the 18th for a one-under 71 and dropped three places from T2.Do you remember Joohyung Kim? A score boy at the Manila Masters in 2016 when SSP Chawrasia had won, the Korean lifted the Panasonic Open India trophy in 2019 as a fresh-faced teen of 17.Now, he goes by ‘Tom’, a nickname he had as a child after Thomas the Tank Engine.With 10 birdies in 15 holes, Kim was swinging for the magic figure of ‘59’ at Albany GC.On the par-4 16th, his second shot found the fringes of the green. Game over? 22 feet, into the hole. Make that 11-under. On the par-3 17th, he conceded an uncharacteristic double bogey with what he called “a target mistake” from the bunker. But then came the shot of the day. A 47ft hole-out from the left bunker on the closing hole was the moment to savour in a round of 10-under 62.“It’s just a bonus after 17. You have such a good day and to kind of end it like that would have been disappointing, but the birdie on the 18th kind of makes dinner taste a little better,” said the 22-year-old, whose year had so far been with riddled with unwanted scrutiny.But that is another story.

Then, you can see that you can take over – it was pleasant. But I was making moves in this phase without thinking a lot.”Gukesh was happy about the risk-reward ratio that the opening prep offered to him.“The position was doubleedged and good for me. But I did stupid things too. Happy to pull myself back together.” Saying that he was “kicking myself for Qf4 (14th move)”, Gukesh said,“Until 22.. Nc2, I did not realise that I had some chances. It was almost like a blitz game after that.“After I played Na3 (21st move), I sensed I was out of danger. Then, he blundered.”Of his visit to his lounge at the crucial juncture, Gukesh said, “I was drifting away with a lot of thinks (sic). I wanted to refresh and think clearly and decided to play one move at a time after losing the advantage. This match is a more emotional struggle compared to other events and mental coach Paddy Upton has helped me a lot.”","The 18-year-old won in just 26 moves and over three and half hours.

World Chess Championship: D Gukesh beats Ding Liren to take lead,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/chess/world-chess-championship-d-gukesh-beats-ding-liren-to-take-lead/articleshow/116122343.cms,"D Gukesh (Photo credit: FIDE)

In a battle in the wild, the one who smells blood first and has the tactics and wherewithal to go for the kill, generally gets his prey. D Gukesh was that man in the cerebral battlefield in Singapore on Sunday.The Indian challenger capitalised on a dumbfounded Ding Liren to score a pivotal win in the 11th game of their World Chess Championship Match and take a monumental step towards the throne.The streak of seven draws was broken on Sunday, and Gukesh leads the match 6-5 with three games remaining. The Indian will play with black pieces on Monday before Tuesday’s rest day. Team Gukesh hunted as a team like a pride of lions combining in the Serengeti.They gave him a playable idea on the fifth move itself with pawn push to a3. That was sandwiched between Ding Liren’s act of “calculating nonsense” for 38 and 22 minutes.Ding came up with a human move of bishop g4 -- pinning knight in line of the rival queen. But after doing away with his knight for bishop, Gukesh came with a move (9.d3) that spoiled his hunt, probably a momentary brain fade to the huge clock advantage. Ding’s precise two-step act then forced Gukesh to spend more than an hour for his reasonable response (11th move g3).Weighing his counter-attacking options, Ding came up with effective manoeuvring of both his knights and queen-side rook. Looking at those dancing knights on the c5 and e5 square, Gukesh came with a reflexive human choice (15.Rd1) when the computer suggested a calmer and nuanced Nd2.A sizeable number of Indian online chess-heads would have had their hearts in their mouths as the evaluation bar shifted in Ding’s favour. The hidden delight in his body language was also apparent.He was sensing the candy offered by Gukesh. But here Ding probably thought too far ahead and pushed a seemingly wrong pawn (15....g6 instead of e6) -- leaving a considerable gap between the lip and gift. That move blocked his own kingside bishop and allowed multiple course corrections for Gukesh -- the ‘a’ and ‘b’ pawns moving a step ahead and the rival’s queen-side bishop controlling the a3-f8 diagonal instead.Ding also conceded his crucial knight of c5 square in the process. Though Ding tried some counterplay by moving his other knight and getting rid of the b-file pawn with queen, Gukesh pressed with rook in the ‘b’ file, forcing the queen away. After Ding castled, the Indian uncorked his tactical nous with knight a1 on the 25th turn.A computer-like rook move here would have probably brought the opponent’s inactive bishop into play (from h6) into the endgame. Ding, now already fearful and retreating into his shell, did not see the 25..Na7 riposte (giving him good drawing chances).Gukesh then went for the kill in an extremely shaky position for the opponent, finally ending up with the reigning champion not spotting a temporary queen sacrifice (for knight) that would have made Gukesh piece up a couple of moves later.The Chinese world No. 22 had to resign as world No. 5 Gukesh enjoyed bringing down his kill after a fascinating chase in which, to Ding’s credit, he did not remain a mute spectator. With both players having to make about 15 moves in 15 minutes and the emotional pendulum swinging, it was anybody’s game. Ding’s psychological situation probably put cold water on his resistance at this juncture.Team Gukesh was up to date with the latest Reversed Blumenfeld Gambit in Reti Opening that was reminiscent of reverse Benoni structure. He thanked his team, led by V Anand’s former second Gajeswi, and claimed that they checked this idea a day before and presented it to him.","D Gukesh capitalised on a dumbfounded Ding Liren to score a pivotal win in the 11th game of their World Chess Championship Match.

ADELAIDE: A frail but familiar figure sauntered into the Adelaide Oval on Saturday. Former Australia captain Greg Chappell , a bit older, a bit weather-beaten at 76 but still retaining that presence and keen cricketing sense, has been watching the goings-on in the second Test with interest.Chappell, having recovered from a recent bout of ill health, was delighted to run into Sunil Gavaskar and Ricky Ponting, but also took some time out to talk cricket.As the long conversation veered to this five-game series being played in the backdrop of both India and Australia facing questions of transition, the familiar twinkle in his eyes reappeared. As India coach, Chappell ostensibly faced the ire of senior players, fans and the establishment whenever he attempted to steer the team in a new direction. After his stint, the public perception remained — rightly or wrongly — that his brusque, ‘Australian’ management style wasn’t the best fit for India.Chappell disagreed with the notion that he wanted to shelve some stellar careers earlier than they would have preferred, but agreed that it becomes difficult for teams to make the tough calls.“You obviously want any great player to play as long as they can. They obviously love playing the game. They want to play it as long as they can. And they have every right to go on as long as they can. That’s why you need robust selection policies and selection panels to make those tough decisions,” he said.“The players might themselves want to make that decision, but it’s a well-paid job. Who’s going to want to walk away from that? That’s why someone else has to make that decision. It is tough to talk to those players about that. You’ve got to pick the right people to be selectors, those that are prepared to have those tough conversations.” Chappell said every big player goes through that stage when he realizes his powers are dipping.“You yourself know whether you’re at your peak or not. With good players you prefer to give them a game too many. It’s tough to get that balance right. When you have superstars, you want them to go on as long as they can. Occasionally, you might let them go on a bit too long. But no cricket team is ever a finished article. You’re always looking at ways to improve it,” he said.Fierce rivals India and Australia are preparing to face a similar predicament in the near future. How does one phase out fading superstars who still retain their popularity? The end of this long series may provide a few answers, but Chappell is someone who has seen it all before.“I don’t think it’s the hand-eye coordination, the mind goes. You get to that stage where you can’t give the game the singleminded focus,” he said. “A conversation with a mentor may remind you what you need to think about. It’s about whether you want to admit the time is up.”",Former Australia captain Greg Chappell says it is difficult for teams to make tough calls.

Rohit Sharma's struggle continues

NEW DELHI: India pacer Mohammed Siraj and Australia’s star batter Travis Head are reportedly under ICC scrutiny following a heated exchange during the second Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Adelaide. Australia won the match by 10 wickets, leveling the series 1-1.The incident occurred during the 82nd over of Australia's innings when Siraj bowled a stunning in-swinging yorker to dismiss Head. Following the wicket, Siraj gave Head a fiery send-off, gesturing aggressively towards the stands.In response, Head exchanged words with Siraj before walking off to applause from the home crowd.The incident triggered a backlash from the Adelaide crowd, which booed Siraj whenever he fielded near the boundary or came on to bowl, expressing displeasure at his conduct.According to The Daily Telegraph, both Siraj and Head are expected to face a disciplinary hearing for their on-field altercation. However, they are unlikely to receive suspensions, as such incidents typically attract milder penalties.Head, who was named Player of the Match, addressed the incident during a press interaction, revealing that he had said ""Well bowled, mate"" after hitting Siraj for a six prior to his dismissal. While he expressed regret over his reaction, he defended his decision to stand his ground.“It probably (went) a little bit far; that’s why I’m disappointed in the reaction I gave back, but I’m also going to stand up for myself. Like to think in our team, we wouldn’t do that. [It’s] not the way I’d like to play the game and feel like my teammates are the same. If I see that, I probably call it out, which I did,” Head said during the press conference.Siraj, however, disputed Head’s account in an interview with Star Sports ahead of Day 3.“When you get hit for a six on a good ball, it fires you up differently. And when I got him bowled, I only celebrated, and he abused me, and you saw that on TV, too,"" he told Star Sports.“I only celebrated at the start; I didn’t say anything to him. What he said in the press conference wasn’t right, it’s a lie that he only said ‘well bowled’ to me. It’s there for everyone to see that that’s not what he said to me. We respect everyone; it’s not like we disrespect other players. I respect everybody because cricket is a gentleman’s game, but what he did wasn’t right. I didn’t like it at all.”By Day 3, tensions seemed to have eased. The two players were seen chatting when Siraj came out to bat during India’s second innings, signaling that they may have put the incident behind them.","Mohammed Siraj and Travis Head reportedly under ICC scrutiny following heated exchange.

Rohit Sharma press conference after loss in Adelaide Test vs Australia

ADELAIDE: Is this the point where the India-Australia series takes an ugly turn? The send-off Mohammed Siraj gave Travis Head after dismissing him on the second day seems to have galvanized both the Aussie media and public, especially after Head's assertion that he had merely said ""well bowled"" to the India pacer before the ugly exchange of words, some of which was caught on the broadcast.Siraj's animated celebration while pointing Head to the Aussie dressing room seems to have made him the object of a witch-hunt here, with boos ringing out at the ground whenever he is in action and talking heads on social media and TV screens seemingly obsessed with it.Ravi Shastri, while commentating on Fox Sports, wryly noted how ""Siraj is the crowd favourite"", while both captains were inundated with queries on the issue, putting Australia's fine win in the shade.Siraj tried to clear the air but added more fuel to the fire, asserting that Head had lied during his media interaction on Saturday. ""It was a battle going on with Head and he batted really well,"" Siraj told former India spinner Harbhajan Singh — himself in the centre of the ‘Monkeygate' affair involving Andrew Symonds in 2008 — during an interaction on Star Sports Hindi.""When you get hit for six off a good ball, it fires you up. When I bowled him, I just celebrated, and he abused me. You saw that on TV too. I didn't say anything to him at the start. What he said in the press conference was a lie, that he said ‘well bowled' to me.""The scale of the controversy blew up in the faces of skippers Rohit Sharma and Pat Cummins after the game and both stood by their players. ""I was standing at slip, I don't know exactly what was said,"" Rohit said, ""When India and Australia play, these things happen. He (Siraj) got the wicket and celebrated it. There were a few words exchanged. Siraj likes to get into the battle, it gives him success. It's my job to back that aggression but there is a fine line. One or two words here and there don't make a huge difference.""Cummins harped on similar lines but said he wouldn't try to stop the players from fronting for themselves. ""You let the boys be themselves. Travis is the vice captain, so he's a big boy. He can talk for himself. It's heated. It's a big series. There's a lot riding on it.

India vs Australia: How pink ball is different

NEW DELHI: After India's lacklustre performance in Adelaide, cricket legend Sunil Gavaskar expressed his disappointment, criticising the team's approach and preparation.Australia secured a resounding 10-wicket victory over India in the second Test, leveling the five-match series at 1-1. Delivering a commanding performance, the visitors wrapped up the pink-ball Test in just two-and-a-half days, showcasing their dominance and leaving India with much to ponder.Gavaskar candidly highlighted the need for focus and commitment, urging the players to prioritise their cricketing responsibilities. India's defeat raised questions about their strategy, mindset, and adaptability in challenging conditions.Gavaskar's pointed remarks serve as a wake-up call for the team to regroup, reassess, and deliver the performances expected at the international level.“Look at the remainder of the series as a three-match series. Forget that it's a five-match series. What I would like the Indian team to do is use the next couple of days as practice. You can't be sitting in your hotel rooms because you have come here to play cricket. You don't have to practice the whole day, you can practice a session in the morning or afternoon, but don't waste the two days. You would've been here playing a Test if it went for five days,”Gavaskar told Star Sports.The former India captain further stressed that the responsibility of organising additional practice sessions should rest entirely with the captain and coach.“You have to give yourself a chance to get into rhythm. You haven't got runs, your bowlers haven't got rhythm. The optional practice should only be dependent on the captain and coach. The coach can say, ‘hey, you got 150 or you bowled 40 overs in the match, you don’t need to come to practice'. They should be the one giving the options, not the players. If it is left to the players, they will certainly say, ‘no, I will be staying in my room’,” said Gavaskar.“That's not what Indian cricket is. It's an honour, privilege to be playing for India, and I counted the number of days they would be here; 57 days is what they will be here for. 25 days for five Tests, two days for PM's XI match, so they got 30 days of off. They got one extra day in Perth, they are getting two days here. So my request to them is to please come here and practice.”",India lost the second Test against Australia by 10 wickets in Adelaide.

As it Happened:

NEW DELHI: In a significant advancement towards potentially becoming the youngest world chess champion , Grandmaster D Gukesh of India defeated Ding Liren from China in the 11th Game of the World Chess Championship on Sunday.This victory places Gukesh in the lead with a score of 6-5. This is the first time Gukesh has led in this match, with only three games remaining.Historically, no challenger in modern chess has ever secured a win after being tied 5-5 after the 10th game, putting Gukesh in a favourable position.For Liren, the only consolation could be his victory in the 12th game of the previous World Championship match against Ian Nepomniachtchi of Russia.The game began with Gukesh's Knight move, which was met with a surprising reverse Benoni opening by Liren, suggesting an over-the-board decision rather than a planned one.Gukesh quickly gained a significant time advantage on the clock, making it challenging for Liren to recover in such a crucial game.Despite initial concerns about Liren's opening, the Chinese player capitalized on Gukesh's erroneous plan in the early middle game, temporarily turning the tables. However, Liren missed a simple manoeuvre that could have given him a slight advantage, and Gukesh responded with a spectacular pawn sacrifice on the queen side, creating space for his rooks.As Gukesh doubled his rooks on the file, exerting pressure, Liren made a critical blunder, leaving him dejected and Gukesh with a winning move.With two games remaining as White, Liren has the best chance to stage a comeback, while Gukesh needs only three draws to secure his maiden world championship title. The stage is set for an exciting conclusion to this high-stakes chess battle.","D Gukesh of India defeated Ding Liren from China in the 11th Game of the World Chess Championship on Sunday.

ADELAIDE: India's bowling issues in the pink-ball Test have reignited talk of flying in veteran pacer Mohammed Shami , who has just recovered from a prolonged year-long absence following ankle surgery and played in a few domestic games.""Definitely that door is very much open,"" captain Rohit Sharma said when asked about the prospect of roping in Shami for the remaining Tests of the series. Rohit, though, added a rider.""We're just monitoring him because while playing Syed Mushtaq Ali , he again got some swelling in his knee, which obviously hampers his preparation to come and play a Test match. We want to be very, very careful. We don't want to bring him into a situation where he plays and then pulls up sore or something happens.""Shami recently played for Bengal in a Ranji Trophy game against MP in Indore in which he bowled 43.2 overs across two innings and picked up seven wickets. Shami has also played seven games in the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20s and bowled 27.3 overs.However, he hasn't played at the international level since the 50-over World Cup at home in Nov 2023.

NEW DELHI: Former Indian cricketer Aakash Chopra provided a critical analysis of India's dismal performance in the second Test against Australia in Adelaide.Reflecting on India’s collapse, Chopra pinpointed batting failures as the crux of the problem, emphasizing the lack of resolve and application from the Indian batters.His remarks came after India folded twice in the Test, managing just 180 in the first innings and a paltry 175 in the second, leaving the visitors with no cushion against a formidable Australian bowling attack.Chopra underlined that the decision to bat first was sound given the conditions, but the execution left much to be desired. ""Where did we go wrong? It's a big question. The truth is that it was a batting failure, not once but twice. The decision to bat first was absolutely right. In the first innings when you got out for 180, you could have said that it happens. However, the second innings, the pitch had become flat now,"" he said on his YouTube channel.One of Chopra’s main observations was the lack of intent and patience from Indian batters to occupy the crease.There was some help in the first innings for sure. If you are not going to bat 80 overs across two innings in a Test match, that is the problem. There is not one person in the team who said he would play 80-100 balls. Not a single player played 50 balls. We are talking about 50 runs but no one played 50 balls,"" he pointed out.Despite high expectations from stalwarts like Virat Kohli Rishabh Pant , and Rohit Sharma , no one managed to shoulder the responsibility. ""It wasn't a pitch where you couldn't have played 50 balls. It wasn't a pitch where you couldn't have survived for a slightly longer time. You have to bat at least one session without losing a wicket,"" he concluded.""In the end, the Indian batting frailties were exposed once again. When wickets fall with the new ball, Virat Kohli is at No. 4, you are expecting a lot from Rishabh Pant but he hasn't played a big knock so far in this series, and Rohit Sharma at No. 6, it's not looking good. Our batting has let us down. That is the one big reason for India's loss at Adelaide.""Eyeing a strong comeback in the five-match series, India will face Australia in the third Test at The Gabba in Brisbane on December 14.","Former Indian cricketer Aakash Chopra provided a critical analysis of India's dismal performance in the second Test against Australia in Adelaide.

Rohit Sharma's struggle continues

Rohit backs young pacer Harshit Rana

NEW DELHI: Skipper Rohit Sharma on Sunday issued a strong message to India’s bowling unit, after the disappointing loss in the pink-ball Test at Adelaide, stressing that Jasprit Bumrah cannot carry the entire burden alone.Speaking candidly, Rohit emphasised the need for collective responsibility from all bowlers. The Indian captain urged the team to step up and support their star pacer, calling for greater contributions from the rest of the bowling attack as Bumrah's exceptional skills can’t be expected to deliver from both ends.India suffered a 10-wicket loss to Australia in the second Test, with Jasprit Bumrah being the lone standout performer during the home team's first innings, claiming a four-wicket haul.""We are not just playing with one bowler. There are other bowlers also who will have to take responsibility and get the job done for the team, be it (Mohammed) Siraj, Harshit Rana , Nitish Reddy , Akash Deep or Prasidh (Krishna),"" skipper Rohit said at the post-match presser, sending a loud and clear message for his bowling unit.The captain acknowledges the inexperience in the lineup but believes the players will gain confidence and improve over time.""These bowlers have just arrived in Test cricket , it's important to give them confidence. Whenever they play a match, it's important to give them confidence. We keep planning and discussing. But you can't expect Bumrah to bowl from both the ends and from morning to evening,"" Rohit said.""It's very important to manage (all) bowlers. We discuss all this with each other. We talk to the bowler and then we make the decisions.""Rohit stated that he takes the workload management of bowlers very seriously, emphasising its importance for their long-term success and well-being.""I speak with him (Bumrah) whenever he finishes a spell. I enquire about how his body is feeling, is he (feeling) fresh or not? It's a five-match series, we want Bumrah to play all the matches and remain fresh,"" Rohit said.Young Harshit Rana was hammered for 86 runs in just 16 overs, but the skipper was adamant about not making the two-Test youngster the scapegoat for India’s comprehensive defeat in Adelaide.""Rana didn't do anything wrong in the first Test. He did very well. He gave the team crucial breakthroughs when they were needed. I believe that if someone hasn't done anything wrong, he cannot be left out without a reason because then what confidence does the team get?""It happens, sometimes the team doesn't get what it wants. He came up against a good batsman who put pressure on him. But he has a heart and a passion so we should back such (qualities in a player),"" Rohit said.""The player might think that you give me one match but leave me out in the next. This is not good for any player or any team, that's what I think. We should assess what the situation is and how helpful the conditions are,"" he explained.While Rohit emphasised that he doesn't want to judge Rana based on just one game, he made it clear that if a change is necessary, it will be made for the benefit of the team.""But judging someone after one match is not the right thing. We always keep (all) options open for any player to play since we have to win a Test match. If we must make such changes to win a Test, we will do that.""","India suffered a 10-wicket loss to Australia in the second Test at Adelaide.

NEW DELHI: Former South African cricketer AB de Villiers weighed in on the Mohammed Siraj-Travis Head verbal spat during the Adelaide Test , stating while such on-field exchanges are part of the game, it is important to maintain respect and ensure they don’t escalate beyond acceptable limits.The confrontation began when Siraj cleaned up Head with an exceptional yorker on the first day of the pink-ball Test . Head asserted he had simply acknowledged the delivery with 'well bowled', but Siraj's enthusiastic celebration and subsequent dismissal of Head's statement as a 'lie' heightened the friction.The atmosphere remained tense into the following day's play, with Adelaide spectators showing vocal support for their hometown player, Head, while expressing disapproval through booing at the venue.""Maybe questionable giving Head a send-off after he scored a match-winning hundred.

'We were not good enough with bat'

ADELAIDE: In keeping with the Sunday spirit here - all business is closed by 5 pm in the Adelaide CBD - India shut shop in the morning session itself on Day Three to hand Australia a 10-wicket win in the second Test.The result was not entirely unexpected coming into this day-night Test , given India's relative inexperience playing pink-ball games, and the victory margin is a fair reflection of Australia's superiority in these conditions.Nevertheless, that this is the shortest completed Test between these two teams in terms of balls - it was all over in 1031 deliveries, beating the Indore record of 1135 balls - indicates India have offered up a perfect case study in how to scramble the winnability of a unit. Their incredible 295-run comeback win in Perth is now history, its first-mover advantage frittered away. The backs are to the wall again in this five-game series.Australia came into this game reviled by their own supporters and a vitriolic media, their captain battling allegations of having 'gone soft'. Pat Cummins rode high on a five-wicket haul in the second innings and some astute marshalling of his superior bowling resources. Scott Boland's entry added punch to the pace lineup. The combative local hero Travis Head scored a game-changing ton. The determined Marnus Labuschagne, who had a point or two of his own to prove, provided the support act. Head's verbal volleying with Mohammed Siraj provided the melodrama.The game lasted only two days and a session but broke attendance records here, with a total of 1,35,012 spectators turning up. Pink-ball games may be short, but they do fill the local coffers.In the other corner, this was Rohit Sharma 's fourth consecutive Test defeat as captain. Coupled with a horror run of personal batting form which seems to be playing on his mind, India have their work cut out heading into the third Test in Brisbane. They have also slipped to No. 3 in the World Test Championship ranks and their dream of qualifying for that WTC final on their own steam now becomes doubly difficult.First, though, there is pride at stake here. The morning began with promises of another Rishabh Pant special, given his audacious attempts to take the fight to the Aussies on the second night. By the time it was all over barely two hours later, many departing Aussie fans - who may have gone berserk at the beer counters in anticipation of an early finish - were hurling the choicest abuses at anyone in an Indian jersey. Pant lasted only till the sixth ball of Mitchell Starc's first over of the day. He gave the second delivery the charge and a wild heave and missed. By the fifth ball, the nerves appeared to be settling, and he resisted poking outside off. The sixth ball was another piece of Starc magic, simply too good for Pant - fuller, angling in and straightening off the seam to kiss the bat's edge and fly to the 'keeper.India knew the game had been lost right there, though Nitish Reddy - who is so far the highest scorer in each of India's completed innings on this tour - hung on grimly, even showcasing his 360-degree strokeplay, but a barrage of short stuff from Cummins had the final say.India lasted only 11.5 overs on the third morning in a second innings lasting 36.5 overs, in which they went at 4.75 runs per over when the need of the hour may have been to wear the bowlers down. That left Australia's openers only 19 runs to chase, and there was to be no further drama.""This week we were back at our best,"" a satisfied Cummins said. ""This is the kind of team that I remember and how we want to play our cricket. It's great to have Travis Head in the side. Every time he walks in, it's like the match is in the balance and in the space of a few sessions he took the game out of their hands.""As for India, Jasprit Bumrah lacked pace support but the immediate concern for Rohit Sharma is the batting unit's fallibility. ""I wouldn't say it's lack of experience with the pink ball (that cost us). When you come to Australia you have to play a pink-ball Test. The best chance of winning here is to put runs on the board. The disappointing bit is that we didn't bat well enough,"" Rohit said.""I wouldn't say I'm worried. If you take the last five or six matches, we haven't batted well enough, but when we play in India the high-scoring games are not going to happen (because of the turning pitches). Abroad, the conditions are there (to bat long). There's been a lot of conversation around that. We want to battle it out, stay out there. Our focus will now be on Brisbane and how we can do things better.""Some of India's batters, incidentally, hit the nets immediately after the game ended.","Australia beat India by 10 wickets in the second Test in Adelaide. The match was all over in 1031 deliveries, beating the Indore record of 1135 balls. Travis Head scored a game-changing ton for the Aussies. It was Rohit Sharma's fourth consecutive Test defeat as captain.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116121169,imgsize-54596,width-400,resizemode-4/116121169.jpg"

Can Shreyas Iyer and Ricky Ponting finally bring PBKS their maiden IPL title?

NEW DELHI: Following India's decisive 122-run loss to Australia in Brisbane, captain Harmanpreet Kaur acknowledged the need for a comprehensive review of their bowling strategies.India's bowling performance was inadequate as Australia posted an enormous 371/8. This stands as the highest total ever conceded by India in women's ODIs, surpassing the previous mark of 338/7, also set by Australia at Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium earlier this year.Despite Saima Thakor 's commendable figures of 3-62, India's bowling attack struggled significantly. Centurions Georgia Voll and Ellyse Perry, alongside half-century makers Phoebe Litchfield and Beth Mooney , dominated the Indian bowlers.Notably, leg-spinner Priya Mishra 's figures of 1-88 in ten overs set an unwanted record as the most expensive spell by an Indian bowler in women's ODIs.The target of 372 presented an enormous challenge for India, particularly with Priya Punia unavailable due to injury. Although stand-in opener Richa Ghosh contributed 54 runs and debutant Minnu Mani remained unbeaten on 46, consistent loss of wickets resulted in India being dismissed for 249.“In bowling, we need to go back and think about plans. We expected some more movement but we didn't get that here. We need to bat a bit longer and bat a full 50 overs moving forward. We had a few 40s but couldn't convert it to fifty or hundred,"" said Harmanpreet after the match.""I think we got some partnerships in between despite a big total. Still we had a positive approach, looking for boundaries. But we were short by a few runs. We created a few opportunities with the ball but we couldn't take it. They batted really well, credit to them,” Harmanpreet added.","India's bowling performance was inadequate as Australia posted an enormous 371/8.

that the two had resolved their differences on day three:

Head explained their conversation, revealing Siraj had questioned his use of profanity:

Head admitted he could have handled the situation differently:

He disputed Head's account of the incident and accused him of misrepresenting the truth:

Siraj emphasised his respect for the game and his fellow players:

A confrontation between Australian batter Travis Head and Indian bowler Mohammed Siraj occurred during the second Border-Gavaskar Test match at Adelaide. Head had hit Siraj for a four and a six before Siraj bowled him out.Siraj's celebration after dismissing Head, who was leading the Australian scoring, prompted a verbal exchange on the field. Siraj's yorker had broken Head's stumps. He then approached Head, leading to the visible interaction.Head later commented on the exchange, “I said, ‘Well bowled,’ but he thought otherwise when he pointed me to the sheds. Slightly disappointed with the way that transpired. It is what it is. If they want to react like that, and if that’s how they want to represent themselves, then so be it,” Head toldat the end of day two’s play.Siraj gestured dismissively towards the pavilion, prompting a more forceful reply from Head.“I was surprised at the reaction in terms of the situation of the game,” Head said during his post-match press conference.“There was no confrontation leading up to it, and I felt like it was probably a little bit far at the time.I’m disappointed in the reaction that I gave back, but I’m also going to stand up for myself.”""Sweet with it. He came out and just said [it was] a little bit of misunderstanding … I think we'll move on. We've had a great week, so let's not let it ruin it,"" Head said after being named Player of the Match in the 10-wicket win on his home ground.""It was fine. He said, 'Why'd you swear?' I sort of said, 'Look, I didn’t at first … [but] I definitely swore at you the second time round.'""""I probably could have laughed it off and walked off and enjoyed myself. He just said it was a misunderstanding as well, and there were no issues for me. We move on. I'm sweet. It is what it is.""Siraj, speaking to, offered a different perspective on the exchange. He denied saying anything to Head beyond his initial celebration:""I only celebrated at the start. I didn’t say anything to him,"" he said in an interview with the Indian broadcaster, translated from Hindi.""What he said in the press conference wasn’t right. It’s a lie that he only said, 'Well bowled,' to me. It’s there for everyone to see that that’s not what he said to me.""""We respect everyone. It’s not like we disrespect other players. I respect everybody because cricket is a gentleman's game, but what he did wasn’t right. I didn’t like it at all.""Despite the conflicting accounts, Head and Siraj had a brief interaction on day three when Siraj came to bat. Head, fielding at short leg, further clarified his earlier comments before eventually dismissing Siraj with a catch, bringing India’s innings to a close.The incident underscores the intensity and competitive spirit often seen in high-stakes cricket matches.",A confrontation between Travis Head and Mohammed Siraj occurred during the second Border-Gavaskar Test match at Adelaide.

Former England captain Michael Vaughan took a scornful look at India's defeat in the pink-ball Test against Australia in Adelaide , suggesting that India's bowlers were helpless against Travis Head who scored a century to put his team in the box seat before the hosts completed a 10-wicket win inside three days.Head's counter-attacking knock on the second day produced 140 runs off just 141 balls, which swelled Australia's first-innings lead to 157 runs. India were then bowled out cheaply for the second time in the match, folding up for just 175 to leave the hosts with only 19 runs required to win.The victory for Australia levelled the five-match Border-Gavaskar Trophy at 1-1. India had won the first Test in Perth by 295 runs.Reacting to the result in Adelaide on Sunday, while putting Head's century in focus, Vaughan posted a picture of a big crowd of fans on the field of play after the match. The post on 'X' was captioned: ""This is the field India needed for Travis Head.""Head's knock included 17 fours and 4 sixes as he continued to be the thorn in India's flesh. Last year, he scored centuries in the ODI World Cup final and the World Test Championship final to lead Australia's victories over the Indian team.The win in less than seven sessions also marked the shortest Test between Australia and India Down Under by number of balls delivered, taking only 1031 balls to finish.The series next moves to Brisbane, where the third Test will begin on December 14.",Australia beat India by 10 wickets in the pink-ball Test at Adelaide.
