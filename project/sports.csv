MS Dhoni likely to be treated as 'uncapped player' for IPL 2025 auction

The BCCI is reportedly planning to categorize Mahendra Singh Dhoni as an uncapped player for the 2025 IPL season, reducing Chennai Super Kings' (CSK) retention cost. Dhoni, who retired from international cricket in 2020, may thus be retained for Rs 4 crores. CSK management discussed the rule change with BCCI in July, pending formal regulations announcement.

'No rule more unfair for a player than...': Ravichandran Ashwin strongly opposes reintroduction of this IPL auction rule

Indian spinner Ravichandran Ashwin criticized the potential reinstatement of the Right to Match (RTM) rule for the IPL 2025 auction, arguing it prevents players from receiving their true market value. Ashwin stated that RTM benefits the original team at the expense of other bidding franchises and the player.

India's new crorepati kabaddi players grab eyeballs

The Pro Kabaddi League Season 11 Player Auction in Mumbai saw eight players crossing the INR 1 crore mark, with Sachin Tanwar leading at INR 2.15 crore. Sunil Kumar set a record as the most expensive Indian defender at INR 1.015 crore, while Mohammadreza Shadloui Chiyaneh became the first international player to exceed INR 2 crore in consecutive auctions.

Mumbai: In a development which should be music to the ears of the Chennai Super Kings management, the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) is likely to put MS Dhoni in the category of uncapped players when it announces the player regulations ahead of the 2025 edition of Indian Premier League (IPL), TOI has learnt.The BCCI will thus go back to its rule, which has been in place since the inaugural IPL season, according to which, players who have retired from international cricket for at least five years were put in the uncapped category.It means that retaining Dhoni, a legendary former India and CSK captain, will not cost CSK too heavily to. As per the last retention rules, an uncapped player could be retained for Rs 4 crores. CSK had retained Dhoni for Rs 12 crores in 2022.Asked whether Dhoni would be treated as an uncapped player in the 2025 IPL auction, CSK CEO Kasi Viswanathan told TOI: “I’ve no idea about it. We’ve not requested for it. They (the BCCI) have themselves told us that the ‘uncapped player rule’ may be kept, that’s all. They (the BCCI) haven’t announced anything as yet. The rules and regulations will be announced by the BCCI.” Apparently, the CSK management pushed for the rule during the meeting between owners of IPL franchises and BCCI on July 31 in Mumbai. Dhoni last played for India in the 2019 World Cup semifinal against New Zealand at Old Trafford in Manchester, and announced his retirement from international cricket on August 15, 2020.Before the start of IPL 2024, Dhoni handed over the CSK captaincy to India opener Ruturaj Gaikwad. Arriving to bat only in the death overs, the 43-year-old scored 161 runs in just 73 balls that he faced, at a strike-rate of 220.54, and average of 53.66.At an event in Hyderabad this month, Dhoni said he would wait for the IPL player regulations before taking the call on whether to play another season of the IPL or not. “There is a lot of time for it. We have to see what decision they take on player retention etc. Right now, the ball is not in our court. So, once the rules and regulations get formalised, I will take a call, but it needs to be in the best interest of the team,” Dhoni had said.","MS Dhoni likely to be treated as 'uncapped player' for IPL 2025 auction.

""Vinesh Phogat said, 'Coach, don't be sad because you told me that if I find myself in any difficult situation and need extra energy, I should think that I beat the best woman wrestler (Yui Susaki of Japan in Round of 16) in the world.

I was defending my Tokyo Olympic gold medal. Since January 2023, I have won a lot of titles. My performance was really good, and I was sure that I would defend my medal.

I'm so thankful and blessed I could experience it in my first game. It's an amazing feeling.""Thanks to his FA Cup victory, United manager Erik ten Hag made it through the conclusion of the previous season despite placing seventh in the Premier League.After a performance that hauntingly reminded of many of the games from last season, it remains to be seen if that shocking victory over rivals and English champions Manchester City in May maybe a springboard.""I have seen many spaces where we have to improve but that is normal,"" said Ten Hag. ""It (the win) is good to strengthen the belief.""With important players out due to injury or lack of match fitness, the Dutchman said the night before the game that his team was ""not ready"" for the new season, and it showed.In Rasmus Hojlund 's absence, Bruno Fernandes began as a center forward, and Zirkzee, who returned to preseason late after Euro 2024, was on the bench.This week, Noussair Mazraoui , who joined from Bayern Munich, was thrust into the starting lineup at left back.Even though it seemed if Ten Hag and the winger had made up, Jadon Sancho was left out of the starting lineup.During a disastrous season for United, Fulham defeated them at Old Trafford in February of last year for the first time in 20 years.In the first twenty minutes, the visitors seemed unfazed as Andre Onana did a good job of keeping Kenny Tete's dipping attempt from finding the top corner.However, United steadied themselves after a sluggish start.Mason Mount had not scored a goal since leaving Chelsea just over a year ago, but twice Fernandes blew excellent opportunities by shooting too near to Bernd Leno. This time, the German goalkeeper stretched himself superbly to deny Mason Mount a rare goal.""We created a lot of chances and we should have scored earlier,"" added Ten Hag. ""That is the only criticism of the team: kill in the box!""Seeking a winner, Ten Hag looked to Garnacho and Zirkzee, who were sitting on the bench.By doing so, Fulham had the opportunity to win another historic three points at the Theatre of Dreams, and United left themselves vulnerable.Alex Iwobi lost the opportunity to run clean through on goal due to Andreas Pereira's shoddy pass.Shortly after, Lisandro Martinez prevented a goal from being scored by clearing a risky low cross from Pereira.Rather, the home team took home all three points.Zirkzee was able to get a toe on Garnacho's poorly-hit ball from the right to deflect it past Leno and into the far corner.After Marcus Rashford's selfless ball, Garnacho had an open goal to aim at in stoppage time, and United should have had a second.However, United managed to hold on and give Ten Hag the much-needed winning start.",Manchester United beat Fulham 1-0 in their Premier League opener on Friday. Joshua Zirkzee scored the only goal of the game in the 87th minute. The Dutch international cost United $47 million from Bologna.

I'm going to put in a good tennis, because I know how to play on this court.""Alcaraz claimed that this match was the first time he had ever broken a racquet out of rage.The 2023 Cincinnati runner-up and current ATP number three is without a hardcourt victory going into next Monday's US Open, having only played one second-round summer cement match thus far.""It's really difficult to find some goodstuffs from this match -- I want to forget it and try to move on to New York,"" he said.""I'll try to practice well, to get used to those courts.

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan cricketer Basit Ali recently took a swipe at the International Cricket Council ( ICC ) after Pakistan's star batter Babar Azam retained his top spot in the ODI rankings .India's rising star Shubman Gill , who has recently struggled for runs but still occupies the third spot in the rankings, also came under fire from Basit.Basit expressed his surprise and scepticism, noting that Babar has not played an ODI since November 2023, yet continues to hold the number one position.The rankings, which place Babar ahead of Indian cricket stars Rohit Sharma , Shubman Gill, and Virat Kohli , sparked Basit's criticism.Speaking on his YouTube channel, Basit questioned the ICC’s ranking system and suggested that it might be a tactic to pressure Babar.""When I saw the ICC ranking (for ODI batters), Babar Azam was at the top, number two was Rohit Sharma, number three was Shubman Gill, and then there was Virat Kohli at number four. I did not find it necessary to read the remaining names because I couldn't see Travis Head and Rachin Ravindra. I think the ICC wants that Babar doesn't perform. He would be happy with being the number one-ranked batter in ODIs. Who gives these rankings? On what basis are Babar Azam and Shubman Gill there?"" Basit said.Basit pointed out that the batters, who were standout performers in the World Cup, are conspicuously absent from the top ranks.Basit emphasized that during the 2023 World Cup, players like Rachin Ravindra of New Zealand, Quinton de Kock of South Africa, and Australia’s Travis Head made significant contributions, each scoring multiple centuries.Even Pakistan’s Mohammad Rizwan and Fakhar Zaman managed to notch up a century each.""Babar's last ODI was at the last year's World Cup. We saw the likes of Rachin Ravindra, Quinton de Kock, Travis Head and Virat Kohli at the World Cup. They scored three-four hundreds in the tournament.

""There are great captains, but I'll take my name -- I am my favourite captain,"" he says.In a recent interview with The Indian Express, Bumrah reflected upon the captains he has played under and how each of them remained unique in their own way.While it seems he has been with the Indian team for eternity, the 30-year-old fast bowler has only played 36 Tests so far and is yet to touch the mark of hundred caps in ODIs and T20Is -- blame it on the Covid-forced break and trouble with his back. However, it puts his sublime skills and willingness to learn quickly into perspective.Bumrah credits that learning to what each of the captains he has played under brought to the team.""Rohit is one of the few captains who has empathy towards bowlers, despite being a batsman. He understands players’ emotions and knows what a player is going through. Rohit is not rigid, he is open to feedback,"" Bumrah told the newspaper about the 2024 T20 World Cup-winning skipper.Bumrah made his debut under Dhoni in an ODI in Sydney against Australia in January 2016 and gives credit to Dhoni for making him feel secure once his Indian Premier League heroics earned him an India call-up.""MS (Dhoni) gave me a lot of security, quickly,"" he said, suggesting that it helped him find his feet in the international arena. ""He has a lot of faith in his instinct, and doesn’t believe in a lot of planning.""Talking about Kohli as skipper, Bumrah credited him for putting a lot of emphassis on fitness. He said Kohli continues to lead the team in certain ways, while Rohit was the all-format designated skipper before retiring from the T20Is post the World Cup earlier this year.Rohit now leads in Tests and ODIs, while Suryakumar Yadav has been appointed the skipper for T20Is.""Virat is energy-driven, passionate, wears his heart on his sleeve,"" said Bumrah. ""He pushed us in terms of fitness and changed the narrative that way. Now Virat is not the captain, but he is still a leader. Captaincy is a post, but a team is run by 11 people.""","Jasprit Bumrah says MS Dhoni, Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma are his favourite captains. The fast bowler has only played 36 Tests for India so far. He credits each of the captains he has played under with helping him learn quickly.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112580669,imgsize-92634,width-400,resizemode-4/112580669.jpg"

The most important thing is not to let the runs get too far away, let them sweat a little bit more for their runs, and I believe, with the amount of time left in the game, that we can chase anything they give us.""After both teams' bowlers dominated the first innings, Markram and opening partner Tony de Zorzi turned the tide of the game by attacking from the outset in the second session.After West Indies bowlers reduced the pace of scoring later in the afternoon session, Jayden Seales was the one to finally break the stand after they had put on 79 runs, as de Zorzi (39) was caught by wicketkeeper Joshua da Silva.Gudakesh Motie 's removal of Markram for 51 (108 balls, six fours) set off a collapse that saw South Africa lose four wickets for 19 runs and find themselves in trouble at 139 for five. Their discipline paid off at the beginning of the final session.The Caribbean side rallied behind Seales (3 for 52) and left-arm orthodox spinner Motie (2 for 61), and the West Indies had an opportunity to dismiss South Africa before the end of the day.But Mulder, the all-rounder who had taken four for 32 in the West Indies first innings, was a resolute partner for wicketkeeper-batsman Verreynne, whose unbeaten fifty had come off 71 balls and featured seven fours. Verreynne was 34 not out alongwith Mulder's innings.Despite having to prioritize protecting their wickets, both players sought chances to score, and in the last two overs of the day, Mulder succeeded in hitting Motie and left-arm spinner Kavem Hodge for the first two sixes of his innings.",South Africa lead West Indies by 239 runs at stumps on second day of second Test. Aiden Markram and Kyle Verreynne hit half-centuries in Proteas' second innings. West Indies dismissed South Africa for 144 in the morning session.

'Playing India at World Cups is always a great challenge': New Zealand all-rounder Amelia Kerr,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/playing-india-at-world-cups-is-always-a-great-challenge-new-zealand-all-rounder-amelia-kerr/articleshow/112571408.cms,"NEW DELHI: New Zealand all-rounder Amelia Kerr thrives on the unique challenges presented by playing against India in World Cup cricket . She highlights the fervent support Indian fans bring, regardless of location, and the crucial role spin bowling plays in their strategy. Kerr finds facing India's world-class batters, particularly in spin-friendly sub-continent conditions, a compelling test of her skills.“I think playing at World Cups, playing India is something I think that's always a great challenge because wherever you are in the world, they get a crowd that is supporting them.And spin is key for them.”“The ability to play spin well, especially in sub-continent conditions, I think that's a great challenge. And they’ve got some world-class (players), so I think for me that’s a key match-up and playing them is always a challenge,” said Amelia on the ICC 100% Cricket Superstars video, as quoted by IANS.Kerr's preferred mode of dismissal as a bowler is deceiving the batter in flight to induce a stumping, citing her dismissal of Indian captain Mithali Raj during the 2022 World Cup as a prime example.“My favourite (type of) wicket is when they haven't picked you. You beat someone through the gate. And I guess probably the wickets that mean the most is when they're game-changing, of one of the best players in the team, and you kind of make a breakthrough with something special,” she added.While initially a bowling all-rounder, Kerr has evolved into a dependable top-order batter. Her journey to the top of the order began at the age of 17 when her coach surprised her with an opening slot. This opportunity led to a historic unbeaten 232 against Ireland, the highest individual score in Women's ODIs, showcasing her remarkable stroke play.“The power game is probably not something I'm known for around the world. And, I mean, it's nice when you're batting with (New Zealand veteran) Sophie Devine, and you see her clearing the roof at the other end. But for me, it's about placement and timing,” Kerr noted.Representing New Zealand alongside her sister, Jess Kerr , holds profound significance for Amelia. Sharing moments like the national anthem evokes a special feeling.“To represent your country with your sister is amazing. We always kind of share that moment when we sing the national anthem together. There’s something that's really special for us. One game that stands out a lot was after the series I came back from mental health, and we played India at home, and we chased down 280. And I was batting in the middle of Jess and I got a hundred that day and Jess hit the winning runs. We kind of had a few tours not being together through her being injured and my mental health. So it just felt like a pretty special moment for the both of us and our family,” Kerr concluded.","New Zealand all-rounder thrives on the unique challenges presented by playing against India in World Cup cricket.

Maharashtra government

to make amends & announce reward to boost shuttler's morale before Paris Games

MUMBAI: Badminton player Chirag Shetty 's comments regarding Maharashtra government ignoring his achievements while rewarding cricketers from the state for winning the T20 World Cup have stirred up a hornet's nest.Chirag along with Satwiksairaj Rankireddy - the No.3 ranked men's doubles team in the world - played a crucial role in India winning their maiden Thomas Cup in 2022. Chirag, though, wasn't recognised for his effort. After seeing the cricketers being feted, the aggrieved shuttler told TOI on Sunday that ""if the state government can honour World Cup-winning stars, they should also honour him and treat other sports equally"".Besides the Thomas Cup success, Chirag has also won doubles gold at Asian Games , Commonwealth Games and bronze at World Championships. The 27-year-old Malad resident has now found support from prominent sportspersons of the city, who urged the state government to resurrect the situation by rewarding Chirag. Uday Pawar , coach and mentor of Chirag, felt that his ward's achievement is on par with that of cricketers and he should have been rewarded for it.Former India hockey captain MM Somaya said that he had sympathy for Chirag as ""winning the Thomas Cup is a truly historic achievement"". He went on to add that the state government can make amends by announcing a reward for him just before the Paris Olympics begin which will be good ""for his morale as well"".Pawar, a former Asian Games medallist and a prominent badminton coach in the city, said: ""I am not comparing sports but like the cricketers who have brought honour to Maharashtra, so has Chirag. I feel his achievement is on par (with the cricketers). A person who has brought honour to the state shouldn't be demanding but the state should recognise his efforts on its own.""He added that players shouldn't ask for recognition and instead the state government should have a mechanism in place where once they have achieved something of national significance, they should be rewarded.""I think the state's sports ministry should be more active. They should do their own homework and should be aware of who the top players from Maharashtra are. If they don't know about his/her achievement, then the ministry is not functioning properly. They should have people who will keep in touch with the respective associations from state and take updates on how their players are performing,"" said Pawar.Somaya said: ""I would fully agree with Chirag and I would quite understand his position. Since he was the only player from Maharashtra, he deserves the recognition. Need not be such a huge amount that they have given to cricketers but in some manner, he should be rewarded. He is seeking recognition from the state government which I think is only natural and I think it will be fair even if the state govt does it now. He is one of the key players from Maharashtra to participate in the Olympics and has a good chance of winning a medal with Satwik.""He also urged the state government to have a ""consistent policy"" to reward the performers from other sports as well. ""They should reward the players as soon as they know that someone from the state has achieved something big. It should be a standard process. A person shouldn't be applying for it. You should make a person feel a sense of pride when a state government recognises a player on their own,"" felt Somaya.","Badminton player Chirag Shetty's comments regarding Maharashtra government ignoring his achievements have stirred up a hornet's nest.
