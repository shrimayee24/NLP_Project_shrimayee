Projected lineup against the San Antonio Spurs

Can the Cleveland Cavaliers sustain their dominance?

Thecontinue their dominant season with the league‚Äôs fewest losses, but injuries to key players could disrupt their momentum. Whileis back for tonight‚Äôs game against the San Antonio Spurs, four other players remain sidelined or questionable. Donovan Mitchell missed the Cavs‚Äô previous game against the Portland Trail Blazers due to a groin injury, but the team secured a comfortable win without him. Fortunately for Cleveland, their star guard has been removed from the injury report and will be available against the Spurs. His return provides a major boost as the Cavs aim to solidify their top seed in the Eastern Conference.The Cleveland Cavaliers will be without forward Evan Mobley, as head coach Kenny Atkinson has opted to rest him. Meanwhile, rookie Jaylon Tyson is also out with a bone bruise in his left knee, marking his fifth consecutive missed game. His absence could extend to Friday‚Äôs matchup against the Detroit Pistons, depending on his recovery progress.Backup guard Ty Jerome is a game-time decision due to left knee soreness. His availability will be determined closer to tip-off, leaving Atkinson to adjust rotations if needed. Additionally, G-League players Bates Emoni, Nae‚ÄôQwan Tomlin, and Luke Travers are all out as they fulfill assignments with the Charge, Cleveland‚Äôs affiliate team.With the top seed nearly secured, the Cleveland Cavaliers can afford to manage minutes carefully. However, Atkinson is unlikely to rest too many starters against a Spurs team that, despite missing De‚ÄôAaron Fox and Victor Wembanyama , remains competitive. Here‚Äôs the expected rotation:- PG: Darius Garland | Donovan Mitchell | Craig Porter Jr.- SG: Donovan Mitchell | Sam Merrill | Max Strus- SF: Max Strus | De‚ÄôAndre Hunter | Issac Okoro- PF: Dean Wade | De‚ÄôAndre Hunter | Javonte Green- C: Jarrett Allen | Tristan Thompson | Dean WadeAfter a brief four-game skid earlier this month, Cleveland has rebounded with strong performances against the Jazz and Trail Blazers. Mitchell‚Äôs return further strengthens their chances against a shorthanded Spurs squad.

The Kansas City Chiefs have Travis Kelce back for the 2025-26 season, but his days as the team's top tight end might be numbered.Kelce returns to the Chiefs at age 35, clearly past his prime years. He's a franchise legend, racking up 12,151 receiving yards over 174 regular season games. But his numbers have steadily declined since 2022, the last season he crossed 1,000 receiving yards.Last season, Kelce caught 97 passes on 133 targets, but managed just three touchdowns‚Äîhis career-low. It's reassuring to see Kelce on the field again, but the Chiefs should strongly consider increasing Noah Gray 's snaps.Noah Gray, drafted in the fifth round by the Chiefs in 2021, keeps improving. Last season was Gray's best yet, posting career-highs with 437 receiving yards and five touchdowns from 40 catches on 49 targets.At age 26, Gray is entering his prime years. Keeping him limited behind a declining Kelce could be a serious mistake. Kansas City recognized Gray‚Äôs potential with a contract extension, clearly seeing his value beyond a typical fifth-round pick.Pro Football Focus graded Gray at 74.2 last season, placing him eighth among all tight ends. Kelce's grade was 70.9, ranking him 15th. Gray objectively outperformed Kelce, suggesting it's time for Kansas City to prioritize youth over legacy.Taylor Swift dominated the recent iHeartRadio Music Awards , earning nine awards, including Artist of the Year, Pop Artist of the Year, and a special honor for her global ""Eras Tour,"" plus six fan-voted categories.Though Swift missed the event at the Dolby Theater in LA, she sent a recorded acceptance speech.

Alex Anzalone: Can Detroit Lions afford to lose their defensive leader?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/alex-anzalone-can-detroit-lions-afford-to-lose-their-defensive-leader/articleshow/119601877.cms,"Alex Anzalone (via: Getty Images)

Alex Anzalone‚Äôs defensive impact: A key piece in Detroit‚Äôs success



Alex Anzalone - 2022 Season Highlights [Detroit Lions LB] üêäüî®

Alex Anzalone's contract dilemma: Will Lions re-sign their defensive leader?



Few players embody the heart and hustle of the Detroit Lions quite like Alex Anzalone . A relentless competitor and vocal leader, he has cemented himself as a cornerstone of the team‚Äôs defense. As Detroit aims for a Super Bowl run, Anzalone‚Äôs leadership and playmaking ability remain vital. But with his contract nearing its end, will the Lions extend their defensive anchor?The 2024 season was shaping up to be another strong campaign for Anzalone until a broken forearm sidelined him for several games. His absence was immediately felt, as the Lions‚Äô defense struggled to maintain the same level of intensity without him. However, when he made his return before the postseason, it became crystal clear just how essential he is to Detroit‚Äôs defensive success.One stat that highlights his impact is his dominance in man coverage. According to Pride of Detroit‚Äôs Al Karsten, Anzalone led all linebackers (minimum 150 snaps) in man coverage snaps last season. The veteran linebacker himself acknowledged this rare skill set, boldly stating on X, ""No other LB asked to do what I do.""Pro Football Focus further supports his case, grading Anzalone with a 73.7 in coverage, ranking him 17th out of 189 linebackers. His ability to lock down opposing players in coverage is a rare asset at his position, making him one of the most versatile defenders on the team.As Anzalone enters the final year of his three-year, $18 million deal, Detroit faces a tough decision. At 30 years old, he‚Äôs still playing at a high level, but the Lions must weigh the financial implications of keeping him long-term. With rising stars like Aidan Hutchinson due for massive extensions and the team looking to manage cap space efficiently, Anzalone‚Äôs future in Detroit is uncertain.The ideal scenario for the Lions would be finding a way to retain their defensive leader while balancing their financial commitments. If they decide to part ways, Anzalone won‚Äôt be short on suitors. His ability to cover, lead, and adapt to various defensive schemes makes him a valuable asset for any contender looking to bolster their linebacker corps.Also Read: Could Donald Trump own an NFL team?

If Studio Ghibli made an NHL movie: How Hayao Miyazaki would bring Hockey to life with magic and emotion,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/if-studio-ghibli-made-an-nhl-movie-how-hayao-miyazaki-would-bring-hockey-to-life-with-magic-and-emotion/articleshow/119600899.cms,"Images via YouTube and AP

A story beyond the ice: Themes of resilience, friendship, and dreams

Animation that brings the ice to life with breathtaking visuals

A magical twist: Spirit guardians, folklore, and the soul of the game

Studio Ghibli , known for its breathtaking animation and deeply emotional storytelling, has never tackled hockey‚Äîbut imagine if they did. A Hayao Miyazaki-directed NHL film would be more than just a sports movie; it would be a poetic journey blending the raw intensity of the game with the beauty of nature, the depth of human emotion, and a touch of whimsical magic.Hayao Miyazaki‚Äôs films are never just about their settings; they are about the characters' inner worlds. His NHL movie wouldn‚Äôt focus solely on winning championships but on the spirit of the game. It might follow a young, underdog player struggling with self-doubt, mirroring themes from Kiki‚Äôs Delivery Service or Spirited Away. Perhaps an aging veteran, reminiscent of Porco Rosso, battles past failures while guiding a new generation.Expect themes of resilience, friendship, and dreams‚Äîwhere hockey isn‚Äôt just a game, but a path to personal growth. ""The world isn't simple enough to explain in words,"" Miyazaki once said. His hockey film would likely capture the deeper struggles players face, on and off the ice.Studio Ghibli‚Äôs animation would make every moment on the rink a work of art. The way Miyazaki animates flying‚Äîfluid, free, and exhilarating‚Äîsuggests his depiction of skating would be mesmerizing. Imagine crisp ice shimmering under arena lights, trails of frost curling behind players‚Äô skates, and snowflakes dancing through the air in slow-motion sequences.Nature would play a key role, as it does in all Ghibli films. Perhaps the changing seasons symbolize the players' growth, with autumn leaves falling as training begins and cherry blossoms drifting in the wind when a crucial game arrives.Would Miyazaki‚Äôs NHL movie include supernatural elements? Almost certainly. Maybe the rink is haunted by benevolent spirits who guide players in moments of doubt, much like My Neighbor Totoro‚Äôs forest guardians. A legendary hockey stick imbued with the spirit of past champions could be a central motif, whispering lessons from the past.No Ghibli film is complete without Joe Hisaishi‚Äôs music. His sweeping orchestral pieces would transform every goal, every moment of struggle, into something deeply emotional. Picture a quiet piano melody accompanying a lone skater practicing at dawn, then swelling into a triumphant symphony as the team scores a game-winning goal.Also Read: Former NHL goaltender Wade Flaherty reflects on being the last goalie to be scored on by Wayne Gretzky A Studio Ghibli NHL movie wouldn‚Äôt just be about hockey‚Äîit would be about life, perseverance, and the beauty of human connection.

It was a classic lucha-style encounter between them, although fans did notice some familiar chops by El Grande Americano relating his identity with a current RAW star. In the end, he emerged victorious in his debut match via submission.For weeks, there have been speculations regarding the identity of the man behind the El Grande Americano mask. Many fans believe that it is Chad Gable who is under the mask.

Jonathan Kovacevic responds with strong defensive effort against Vancouver Canucks, despite Sheldon Keefe‚Äôs harsh words

Bruce Boudreau isn‚Äôt here for Sheldon Keefe‚Äôs blunt style. After Keefe publicly criticized New Jersey Devils defenseman Jonathan Kovacevic, Boudreau called him out directly. Kovacevic was urging a playoff mindset from his team‚Äîfair point‚Äîbut Keefe just wasn‚Äôt feeling it.Following the Devils' 3-2 loss to the Ottawa Senators, Kovacevic stressed the importance of making Prudential Center a challenging arena for opponents down the stretch.

Boudreau saw Kovacevic‚Äôs comments as a player genuinely rallying his team. But Keefe‚Äôs response, according to Boudreau, was over the line:Boudreau said.Boudreau knows Keefe's style‚Äîhe‚Äôs called out stars before. Auston Matthews, Mitch Marner, anyone could get it. But usually, Keefe walked those statements back the next day. Boudreau doubts that‚Äôll happen this time around.Boudreau added.Keefe‚Äôs frustration is understandable‚Äîthe Devils are inconsistent lately, 4-6-1 in their last 11 games. But Boudreau‚Äôs got a point: publicly putting your own player on blast probably isn‚Äôt the move.Jonathan Kovacevic isn‚Äôt sulking. Days after Keefe‚Äôs blunt criticism, Kovacevic delivered a key defensive play during Monday‚Äôs matchup against the Vancouver Canucks at Prudential Center. That response matters‚Äîespecially considering Kovacevic recently inked a five-year, $20 million extension with the Devils. He's put up 17 points (1 goal, 16 assists) through 71 games this season.The Devils still sit third in the Metropolitan Division with 81 points, playoff-bound but shaky.

Are Travis and Jason Kelce becoming bigger than the NFL? Looking at the Kelce brothers' media empire,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/are-travis-and-jason-kelce-becoming-bigger-than-the-nfl-looking-at-the-kelce-brothers-media-empire/articleshow/119604160.cms,"Credit: Courtesy photo

Are Kelce brother becoming bigger than the NFL? The rise of New Heights and the Kelce Brand



How The Kelce Brothers Became Social Media Superstars | Athlete Influencers & Brand Lessons

The Kelce brothers, Travis and Jason, have become two of the most recognizable names in football‚Äînot just for their on-field dominance but for their growing influence beyond the sport. While Travis continues to shine as one of the NFL‚Äôs top tight ends for the Kansas City Chiefs , Jason‚Äôs legacy as a former Philadelphia Eagles center remains deeply respected. However, their transition from football stars to media personalities has been nothing short of remarkable. With their hit podcast New Heights, commercial deals, and cultural relevance extending into mainstream entertainment, a question arises‚Äîare the Kelce brothers becoming bigger than the NFL itself?One of the key reasons behind the Kelce brothers‚Äô media success is their widely popular podcast, New Heights. Launched in 2022, the show quickly gained traction, giving fans an unfiltered look into the lives of two of the league‚Äôs most charismatic players. Their chemistry, humor, and candid storytelling have set them apart from other sports-focused podcasts. Unlike traditional NFL coverage, New Heights provides an insider‚Äôs perspective with a mix of personal anecdotes, football insights, and lighthearted banter.The podcast‚Äôs rapid rise has also been fueled by major NFL storylines involving the brothers themselves. From their historic Super Bowl LVII matchup‚Äîwhere they became the first brothers to play against each other in a Super Bowl‚Äîto Travis Kelce ‚Äôs high-profile relationship with pop superstar Taylor Swift, their personal and professional lives have kept fans engaged. These factors have helped New Heights dominate digital platforms, frequently topping podcast charts and racking up millions of views on YouTube.Beyond the podcast, both Travis and Jason have expanded their brand in different ways. Travis, with his magnetic personality, has secured major endorsement deals, made guest appearances on Saturday Night Live, and even ventured into music festivals and entertainment circles. Jason, on the other hand, has leveraged his leadership reputation into storytelling, charitable efforts, and a strong presence in Philadelphia‚Äôs local culture. These ventures have allowed them to transcend football and tap into a broader audience.While the Kelce brothers remain closely tied to the NFL, their media success is beginning to take on a life of its own. The NFL thrives on its star power, but few players in recent history have managed to create a platform as impactful as what Travis and Jason have built. Their appeal now stretches far beyond football, reaching audiences who might not even follow the sport.Travis Kelce‚Äôs involvement with Taylor Swift has only accelerated his cultural status. With Swift‚Äôs massive fan base‚Äîmany of whom had little prior interest in the NFL‚Äîhis presence has contributed to increased viewership and heightened media coverage. His commercials, red-carpet appearances, and off-field activities have positioned him as a crossover star, similar to how figures like Peyton Manning and Tom Brady transitioned into entertainment post-retirement.Jason Kelce , meanwhile, is carving his own path in the media world. Since retiring from football in early 2024, he has already become one of the most sought-after voices in sports media. Whether it‚Äôs analyzing games, delivering heartfelt speeches, or engaging in off-field projects, his ability to connect with fans has made him a respected public figure. Given his storytelling skills and natural charisma, a long-term career in broadcasting or entertainment seems inevitable.While the Kelce brothers‚Äô media empire is undeniably growing, it would be a stretch to say they are ""bigger"" than the NFL itself. The league remains a global powerhouse with a brand value that far surpasses any individual players. However, what Travis and Jason have accomplished is rare‚Äîthey have created personal brands that hold weight both within and outside of football.Their ability to shape narratives, entertain audiences, and stay relevant even beyond the game is what sets them apart. With their influence continuing to expand, they could very well be among the first modern NFL stars to redefine what a post-football career looks like. Whether it‚Äôs through media, entertainment, or business ventures, the Kelce brothers have positioned themselves as long-term cultural figures, ensuring their legacy will extend far beyond their playing days.Also Read: Jason Kelce opens up about his ‚Äòembarrassing‚Äô weight loss struggle after stepping away from football Travis and Jason Kelce are no longer just elite athletes‚Äîthey are media moguls, entertainers, and cultural influencers. Their podcast New Heights, combined with their individual ventures, has elevated them to a status that few NFL players ever achieve. While they may not be ""bigger"" than the NFL, they have certainly expanded their reach beyond the sport in a way that is rare for football players. As they continue to grow their media presence, the Kelce brothers are proving that their impact on sports and entertainment is just beginning.","The Kelce brothers, Travis and Jason, have become two of the most recognizable names in football.

Jayson Tatum reacted to his nickname ‚ÄòThe Anomaly‚Äô while speaking with Travis Kelce and Jason Kelce



Where did Jayson Tatum‚Äôs nickname come from?



Boston Celtics star Jayson Tatum ‚Äôs reaction to a particular nickname has sparked plenty of discussion among fans and media alike. Tatum, who has been a star player for the Celtics, recently addressed the growing trend of people calling him ‚Äò The Anomaly ‚Äô during his chat with NFL star siblings Travis Kelce and Jason Kelce in a new episode a their New Heights podcast .During a guest appearance on the New Heights podcast hosted by NFL stars Travis and Jason Kelce, Jayson Tatum was asked about the nickname that has been making rounds on social media. Travis Kelce, referring to Tatum‚Äôs Wikipedia page, brought up the moniker and asked, ‚ÄúHas anybody that is close to you ever actually called you, ‚ÄòThe Anomaly‚Äô?‚ÄùTatum was amused. He responded with a candid answer that sent the Kelce brothers into fits of laughter. ‚ÄúTwitter is not a real place, I‚Äôll say that,‚Äù Tatum hared. His reaction made it clear that he wasn‚Äôt exactly embracing the nickname, despite its growing popularity.Jason Kelce, however, had a different take. ‚ÄúI would run with that one. I like it. ‚ÄòThe Anomaly‚Äô is a good one. I don‚Äôt know who came up with that.‚Äù To which Travis Kelce agreed, saying, ‚ÄúIt is a banger.‚ÄùThe origins of ‚ÄòThe Anomaly‚Äô trace back to social media, where an X user first suggested it, pointing out Tatum‚Äôs unique skill set. ‚ÄúHandles like someone 6 inches shorter, shoots pull-ups like a guard, finishes at the rim like a center, and consistently defends 1-5.‚ÄùThe nickname got wide attention, and soon, even official team accounts like the Portland Trail Blazers started using it in their game promotions. Basketball Reference has even added it to Tatum‚Äôs list of nicknames.Previously, when asked directly if he liked the name, he hesitated before admitting, ‚ÄúAhhh, I don‚Äôt know.‚Äù He went on to mention that friends and teammates call him by other names, such as ‚ÄòBig Deuce‚Äô and ‚ÄòTaco.‚ÄôAlso Read: Jayson Tatum's injury report (March 26, 2025): Is the Boston Celtics star fit to play against the Phoenix Suns tonight?

IPL 2025: How will KKR, MI, CSK, SRH, RCB fare this season?

After being outclassed in their previous matches, title holders Kolkata Knight Riders and Rajasthan Royals are looking for a quick turnaround when they meet in an IPL match today (March 26).The Knight Riders lost to Royal Challengers Bengaluru by seven wickets in their opener, while the Royals suffered a 44-run defeat against Sunrisers Hyderabad.Both teams share a common issue: their once-impressive batting and bowling units have failed to perform. While the Royals might attribute their bowling struggles to playing at a difficult Hyderabad venue, the Knight Riders lack such an excuse.Except for Sunil Narine, none of the KKR bowlers managed to restrain the aggressive RCB lineup, raising concerns about the effectiveness of mystery spinner Varun Chakravarthy, who struggled significantly. Even on Eden Gardens' pitch, which had some grip, Chakravarthy was hit hard by Phil Salt and Virat Kohli.The KKR camp is hopeful that Chakravarthy will regain his form on a Guwahati pitch that typically offers more assistance to bowlers.The Barsapara Cricket Stadium in Guwahati has hosted four matches in IPL history - two in 2023 and two in 2024. The highest total at this ground came courtesy Rajasthan Royals who scored 199 against Delhi Capitals. The RR vs KKR fixture was washed out last year at this venue.Yashasvi Jaiswal, Sanju Samson, Riyan Parag(c), Nitish Rana, Dhruv Jurel(wk), Shimron Hetmyer, Shubham Dubey, Jofra Archer, Wanindu Hasaranga, Maheesh Theekshana, Tushar Deshpande, Sandeep Sharma, Akash Madhwal.Yudhvir Charak/Kunal Singh Rathore.Quinton de Kock (w), Sunil Narine, Ajinkya Rahane (c), Venkatesh Iyer, Angkrish Raghuvanshi, Rinku Singh, Andre Russell, Ramandeep Singh, Harshit Rana, Spencer Johnson, Varun Chakaravarthy.Vaibhav Arora/Manish Pandey.Sanju Samson (c), Yashasvi Jaiswal, Riyan Parag, Dhruv Jurel, Jofra Archer, Shimron Hetmyer, Tushar Deshpande, Wanindu Hasaranga, Maheesh Theekshana, Nitish Rana, Sandeep Sharma, Fazalhaq Farooqi, Kwena Maphaka, Akash Madhwal, Vaibhav Suryavanshi, Shubham Dubey, Yudhvir Singh, Kunal Singh Rathore, Ashok Sharma, Kumar KartikeyaRinku Singh, Varun Chakaravarthy, Sunil Narine, Andre Russell, Harshit Rana, Ramandeep Singh, Venkatesh Iyer, Quinton de Kock, Rahmanullah Gurbaz, Anrich Nortje, Angkrish Raghuvanshi, Vaibhav Arora, Mayank Markande, Rovman Powell, Manish Pandey, Spencer Johnson, Luvnith Sisodia, Ajinkya Rahane (c), Anukul Roy, Moeen Ali, Chetan SakariyaAs the RR vs KKR head-to-head record reads, the two teams have played each other 30 times in the IPL, with the Royals and the Knight Riders winning 14 each.

NEW DELHI: The National T20 Cup semifinal between Abbottabad and Peshawar on Wednesday had its fair share of cricketing action, but it was Iftikhar Ahmed ‚Äôs over-the-top celebration and Salman Butt ‚Äôs cheeky commentary that stole the show.Pakistan all-rounder and Peshawar skipper Iftikhar Ahmed put in an impressive bowling performance, bagging two crucial wickets for Peshawar.One of his biggest scalps was that of Abbottabad skipper Kamran Ghulam , who looked set to build a solid partnership with Shahzaib Khan. However, Iftikhar had other plans.Coming over the wicket, Iftikhar bowled a full-length delivery that tempted Ghulam to go big.The batter took the bait, attempting to clear the boundary, but instead sent the ball straight into the hands of Maaz Sadaqat at long-on.As the fielder completed an easy catch, Iftikhar erupted in pure joy, letting out a fierce roar and celebrating the dismissal as if he had just taken down one of cricket ‚Äôs all-time greats.And that‚Äôs when Salman Butt, on commentary duty, couldn‚Äôt resist taking a hilarious dig at Iftikhar‚Äôs wild reaction.With perfect comedic timing, Butt quipped, ""Wow!

'It‚Äôs a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee ‚Äî Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match ‚Äî before the Nagpur ODI ‚Äî more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‚ÄòHitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

Ruturaj Gaikwad on Facing RCB and Virat Kohli | Star Nahi Far | #IPLonJioStar

NEW DELHI: Chennai Super Kings (CSK) skipper Ruturaj Gaikwad has acknowledged the sheer impact of facing Virat Kohli in the IPL , highlighting how any match featuring the RCB batting stalwart automatically becomes a high-stakes battle.Speaking on JioStar‚Äôs ""Star Nahi Far"" initiative, Gaikwad expressed his excitement about the upcoming clash between CSK and Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB), particularly with Rajat Patidar leading the opposition.""Really looking forward to playing against RCB, especially with Rajat (Patidar) as the new captain. Immediately when they announced Rajat as the captain, I messaged him and wished him good luck. We have been friends for a while now, we know each other really well, and obviously, RCB has been one of the strongest teams,‚Äù Gaikwad said.However, the CSK captain was quick to highlight the ever-present challenge of facing Virat Kohli.""They have done really well every year now. And whenever Virat Kohli is in the opposition, whenever he is playing, it is always a clash to look forward to. He‚Äôs been doing it for a really long time now, consistently for RCB and for the country as well. So, it is always a great match, and after Mumbai Indians , this is the second match we always look forward to,"" Gaikwad added.RCB‚Äôs battle against CSK at Chepauk is as much about history as it is about current form.The Bengaluru-based franchise has only managed a single win at this venue in IPL history, dating back to 2008. With the conditions heavily favoring spin, CSK will look to exploit RCB‚Äôs vulnerabilities on a turning track.With Ravichandran Ashwin rejoining forces with Ravindra Jadeja and Noor Ahmad, CSK‚Äôs spin department looks formidable.Their recent success against Mumbai Indians, where they dismantled the batting lineup by restricting them to just 70 runs for five wickets in 11 overs, further highlights their dominance.For RCB, Virat Kohli‚Äôs battle against spin will be a key subplot.His recent improvements in playing spin -- especially his use of sweeps and slog sweeps -- will be tested against CSK‚Äôs attack. But for RCB to stand a chance, support from the likes of Phil Salt, Krunal Pandya, and Tim David will be crucial.","Ruturaj Gaikwad is looking forward to playing against Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) RCB have only managed a single win at Chepauk in IPL history, dating back to 2008.

Josh Giddey propelled the Chicago Bulls to win over the Los Angeles Lakers



The Chicago Bulls stunned the Los Angeles Lakers and delivered one of the most jaw-dropping finishes in recent NBA history on Thursday night at the United Center . What seemed like a sure Lakers victory turned into a last-second miracle for the Bulls, thanks to Josh Giddey ‚Äôs incredible half-court buzzer-beater. The moment since went viral among fans as LeBron James failed to stop Giddey‚Äôs stunning basket.Josh Giddey just delivered one of his greatest career moments. It was just 27 seconds remaining on the clock while the Lakers led 111-110, and Austin Reaves took matters into his own hands. Reaves executed a smooth step-back floater to push the Lakers' lead to three. Moments later, after a missed floater by Giddey, Reaves was sent to the free-throw line, calmly sinking both shots to extend the lead to 115-110 with only 13 seconds left.The Bulls were not ready to face defeat yet; at least Giddey was armed up to give one more push.Chicago responded with a quick inbounds play, as Vucevic found Patrick Williams in the corner for a clutch three-pointer, cutting the deficit to just two. Then, in a shocking turn of events, LeBron James attempted an inbound pass to Reaves, only for Giddey to intercept it. Without hesitation, he dished the ball to Coby White, who drained a three-pointer from the wing, putting the Bulls up 116-115 with just six seconds remaining.Just when it looked like the Bulls had stolen the game, the Lakers responded. On their final possession, Luka Doncic inbounded to Reaves, who made a fearless drive to the basket and finished with a clutch layup, again, giving the Lakers a 117-116 lead with 3.1 seconds left.At this point, the Bulls needed a miracle, and surprisingly, they got one. Giddey inbounded to Williams, who quickly returned the ball to him near half-court. That was all the Bulls' guard needed. With just a second left, Giddey launched a prayer from the logo over LeBron James‚Äô minor attempt to defend the ball. The ball soared through the air and found the net as time expired. The United Center erupted with loud cheers for the team, and Giddey was mobbed by his teammates in celebration.Additionally, Giddey finished with 25 points, 14 rebounds, 11 assists, and two steals, securing his second triple-double in just eight games. Fans were quick to respond to the stunning moment.""BRO WHAT!!!!!!üò≥"" one fan wrote on X.‚ÄúHaven‚Äôt seen one of those in a while!‚Äù one fan reacted to the stunning shot made by the young guard.‚ÄúWtf was the end of this game ü§Øü§Ø This clip is only half of the madness too,‚Äù another reacted.One fan was surprised by the stunning shot, ‚ÄúWHAT DID I JUST WITNESS.‚Äù‚ÄúWhat an insane ending, the Lakers must be feeling sick after that one,‚Äù another wrote.Also Read: Angel Reese‚Äôs support for brother JuJu comes with a stylish twist during Sweet 16 showdown: [See Photos] For the Lakers, it was another hard pill to swallow, especially after leading by as many as 18 points in the fourth quarter.

Payas, Divyanshi register upsets

CHENNAI: In what was a perfect start to his farewell event, Indian veteran Sharath Kamal was at his best at the WTT Star Contender on Thursday.Partnering Snehit Suravajjula , Sharath made his way into the men‚Äôs doubles quarterfinals, but he wasn‚Äôt done yet. The 43-year-old put up a good performance in the singles match, securing his place in the second round. Sharath was hardly tested as he powered his way to an 11-7, 11-9, 12-10 win over compatriot Anirban Ghosh .Anirban gifted points to his opponent by committing too many unforced errors in the first two games. The 308th-ranked Anirban learned his lesson and started to push Sharath to the corners of the table in the third game. The lower-ranked player went on to lead 8-4, but Sharath, with all his experience, came back into the contest by saving two game points.At 10-10, the 43- year-old unleashed a backhand to Anirban‚Äôs body and the latter was caught napping. The former India No.1 once again produced a good backhand and Anirban hit the ball long and wide to hand Sharath a win.‚ÄúI played as if tomorrow did not exist. I thought, if I do not win today, then tomorrow I have a break, and then the exhibition match on Saturday.

‚ÄòStreet smart‚Äô Rachin key for CSK

CHENNAI: The floodlights at the MA Chidambaram Stadium hadn‚Äôt yet flickered on, but Virat Kohli was already at work, fine-tuning his strokes on Thursday. That, in a nutshell, would tell you how charged the champion batter is to make it count against a team that has bothered him through his illustrious IPL career. And even after that intense session, he wasn‚Äôt quite done.At the pre-match press talk, RCB mentor Dinesh Karthik , in awe of Kohli‚Äôs pursuit of perfection, said: ‚ÄúI spoke to him just now as I came out and he said that he wanted to work on one more shot. At this point of time, to work on one more shot tells you the hunger he has. He wants to just improve and keep raising the bar. He‚Äôs a special player. The way I see it, he‚Äôs batting as confidently and as well as he has ever done in IPL.‚ÄùWhile the MA Chidambaram Stadium over the years hasn‚Äôt exactly been a happy hunting ground for Kohli in the IPL, his unbeaten 90 (off 52 balls) in Dubai in 2021 remains the highest individual score by an RCB batter against the five-time champions.Against CSK spinners at Chepauk, however, his highest is an unflattering 58 with a strike-rate of 113 ‚Äî slightly below-par by his own lofty standards. Karthik, though, dismissed any doubts about Kohli‚Äôs ability to handle spin, pointing to his success in major tournaments.‚ÄúKohli scored some serious runs in the recent Champions Trophy. He has batted well against spinners in the recent past, especially in white-ball cricket. He was the second-highest run-getter in Dubai and that doesn‚Äôt come without playing spin. I believe right now he‚Äôs batting as well as he has ever done,‚Äù he said.While the spotlight remains on the seasoned stars, New Zealand‚Äôs young all-rounder Rachin Ravindra has shown glimpses of why he could be a key player for the Super Kings this season. His match-winning unbeaten 65 in their opener against Mumbai Indians underlined his growing stature, and against RCB, he could once again be the difference-maker.His ability to counter spin makes him a vital cog in the CSK batting lineup, a feature that head coach Stephen Fleming highlighted about his fellow Kiwi.‚ÄúHis game against spin has always been very good. His development over the last 12 months has been excellent. His last game against RCB (IPL 2024), was one of his best innings (61 off 37 balls). He‚Äôs contributed a number of runs for New Zealand. His knock against MI was superb in terms of controlling the tempo of the game. He‚Äôs got the power and he‚Äôs street-smart,‚Äù Fleming said.",Virat Kohli and Rachin Ravindra could be key for CSK against RCB.

Vyshak Vijaykumar reveals how Shreyas Iyer and Arshdeep Singh backed his 'wide yorkers' plan

Bombay Sports Exchange Episode 1: Interview with Sanjog Gupta, CEO (Sports) at JioStar

NEW DELHI: First, it was Shardul Thakur who rattled Sunrisers Hyderabad with a sensational spell, grabbing four wickets, including the prized scalp of Ishan Kishan for a golden duck. Then, Nicholas Pooran unleashed his brute power, launching a relentless assault with the bat to propel Lucknow Super Giants to their first victory of the Indian Premier League 2025. Led by Rishabh Pant, LSG secured a commanding five-wicket win over Sunrisers Hyderabad at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium on Thursday.Opting to bowl first, LSG were off to a perfect start, thanks to the brilliance of Shardul. The experienced pacer wreaked havoc early, dismissing Abhishek Sharma and Kishan off consecutive deliveries in the third over.Kishan, SRH‚Äôs centurion from the previous game, was dismissed for a golden duck, putting the home side on the back foot.Despite an aggressive counterattack from Travis Head, who smashed a 28-ball 47, Thakur‚Äôs relentless bowling kept SRH in check. He later returned to dismiss Abhinav Manohar and Mohammed Shami, finishing with figures of 4/34 in his four overs.LSG‚Äôs young bowlers, Prince Yadav and Digvesh Rathi, also made valuable contributions, with Yadav removing the dangerous Head and Rathi dismissing the hard-hitting Aniket Verma.SRH skipper Pat Cummins provided some late fireworks with an 18-run cameo off four balls, but LSG‚Äôs bowlers ensured that SRH did not breach the 200-run mark.Chasing 191, LSG had a shaky start as Aiden Markram fell cheaply to Mohammed Shami.However, what followed was sheer carnage.Pooran came out all guns blazing, dismantling the SRH bowling attack with breathtaking stroke play. The left-hander unleashed a relentless assault, smashing seven fours and six towering sixes en route to a 26-ball 70.Mitchell Marsh (52 off 31) provided strong support, while Rishabh Pant (15 off 15) ensured LSG remained in control.Despite Cummins dismissing Pooran and Harshal Patel removing Pant, David Miller‚Äôs unbeaten 13 and Abdul Samad‚Äôs 22 sealed the win for the away side -- with 23 balls to spare.LSG will next face Punjab Kings on Tuesday at the Bharat Ratna Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ekana Cricket Stadium in Lucknow.","Lucknow Super Giants beat Sunrisers Hyderabad by five wickets.

Axar may be promoted, Varun, Abhishek & NKR set to get maiden BCCI contracts

'It was for all the supporters': Ishan Kishan on animated celebration after scoring hundred

Mumbai: In-form batter Shreyas Iyer is set to regain his BCCI central contract when the top brass of the Indian cricket board announces the full list of retained players for the 2024-25 season sometime this week.It's learnt that the BCCI secretary Devajit Saikia will meet India's head coach Gautam Gambhir, currently vacationing in France with his family after leading India to victory in the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy and chief selector Ajit Agarkar in Guwahati on March 29 for a discussion on the central contracts.Guwahati is set to host the IPL match between Rajasthan Royals and Chennai Super Kings on March 30, a day after these discussions.The BCCI announced the India women's cricketers' contracts three days ago.While Iyer is set to get back his BCCI central contract, things are not that certain for Ishan Kishan, who too had been excluded from the list of players with central contracts for the 2023-24 season last year, given that both players skipped domestic matches despite clear instructions from the apex Indian cricketing body.""Shreyas is set to regain his contract, and it will be in a top category. However, discussions are still ongoing on whether in Ishan's case,"" a source told TOI.Iyer was the highest run-getter for India in in India's victorious campaign in the 2025 Champions Trophy recently, scoring 243 runs in five matches at 48.60, with two fifties, and is an integral part of India's ODI side, while Kishan made a sensational debut for Sunrisers Hyderabad in IPL-2025 on March 23, smashing 106 not out off just 47 balls against Rajasthan Royals.The other big point of discussion has been whether India's ODI and Test captain Rohit Sharma, superstar batsman Virat Kohli and allrounder Ravindra Jadeja will be retained in the highest A+ category of central contracts, despite having retired from T20Is.However, a source in the BCCI informed that ""all three will be retained in the highest category, along with Jasprit Bumrah.""Rohit, of course, is slated to lead India on their five-Test tour of England this summer.Meanwhile, left-arm spinning allrounder Axar Patel, who has grown in stature over the last few years and is now the vice-captain of India's T20 side, is likely to be promoted from Grade B to Grade A. He played key roles in India's two ICC title wins in the last two years.Meanwhile, ""Mystery spinner"" Varun Chakravarthy, who made a successful return to the Indian team last October and played a stellar role in India winning the 2025 Champions Trophy with nine wickets to his name in just three matches, is set to bag his maiden BCCI contract.Also set to receive their first BCCI central contracts will be young allrounder Nitish Kumar Reddy, who was impressive in the 2024-25 Border-Gavaskar Trophy, where he played all five Tests in the series and cracked his maiden hundred in the Boxing Day Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, and young opener Abhishek Sharma, who smashed a phenomenal 135 off just 54 balls against England in the fifth and final T20I at the Wankhede Stadium on Feb 2 this year.The name of former off-spinning great Ravichandran Ashwin, who retired during India's tour of Australia last winter, will be naturally removed from the list of BCCI‚Äôs centrally-contracted players after he announced his international retirement last year during the Australia tour.Also see: SRH vs LSG Live Score",Shreyas Iyer is set to regain his BCCI central contract for 2024-25 season.

Bombay Sports Exchange Episode 1: Interview with Sanjog Gupta, CEO (Sports) at JioStar

NEW DELHI: The Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025 clash between Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) and Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) on Thursday saw an emerging talent make headlines.Prince Yadav , a relatively unknown name before the season, delivered a crucial breakthrough by dismissing the in-form Travis Head , who had been threatening to take the game away but eventually became Prince's maiden scalp in IPL.LSG found themselves in a high-pressure situation as Head looked dangerous at the crease, having already smashed 47 runs off just 28 balls. However, in the eighth over, Prince Yadav struck.Bowling a full delivery on middle and off, he completely outfoxed the Australian, who cleared his front leg for a heave but missed it entirely.The ball crashed into the stumps, silencing the Uppal crowd. The LSG dugout, including Zaheer Khan, erupted in applause as the 23-year-old seamer celebrated the massive wicket.Born on December 12, 2001, Prince Yadav is a right-arm fast bowler who rose through the ranks via the Delhi Premier League . His breakthrough came in the 2024 season when he played for Rishabh Pant‚Äôs Purani Delhi 6 franchise.His ability to mix up his pace with minimal change in action set him apart, as he finished the season with 13 wickets in 10 matches.His standout performances earned him a white-ball debut for Delhi, where he had already played two Ranji Trophy games.He made an immediate impact in the 2024-25 Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy (SMAT), taking two crucial wickets against Uttar Pradesh, dismissing both a well-set Nitish Rana and Sameer Rizvi.Prince Yadav‚Äôs impressive performances did not go unnoticed. Just a day after his SMAT debut, the IPL 2025 mega auction took place, and Lucknow Super Giants secured his services for Rs 30 lakh.He continued his stellar form, emerging as Delhi‚Äôs highest wicket-taker in SMAT 2024-25 with 11 wickets at an economy rate of 7.54, helping them reach the semi-finals.With his ability to deliver under pressure and take big wickets, he, being part of injury-laden LSG bowling line-up, is fast becoming a player to watch in IPL 2025.Also see: SRH vs LSG Live Score","Prince Yadav is a right-arm fast bowler who rose through the ranks via the Delhi Premier League.

NEW DELHI: Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) skipper Rishabh Pant ‚Äôs decision to bowl first after winning the toss against Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) in their IPL 2025 clash has left many puzzled.Given SRH‚Äôs explosive batting lineup, many expected LSG to set a target rather than chase one. However, Pant had a clear strategy in mind.Speaking at the toss, Pant stated that his team was confident in their ability to chase any total.""We will bowl first. I think we have to get them out early and look to chase the target. It depends on the team combination; that's why we want to bowl first. We have the batting to chase it down,‚Äù Pant explained.LSG made a tactical change, bringing back Avesh Khan in place of Shahbaz Ahmed to bolster their pace attack.Sunrisers Hyderabad, led by Pat Cummins , boast one of the most destructive batting lineups in the tournament.They made a statement in their opening match, smashing 286 runs against Rajasthan Royals.The likes of Ishan Kishan, Abhishek Sharma, Travis Head , and Heinrich Klaasen can decimate any bowling attack on their day.Pant‚Äôs gamble revolves around early breakthroughs. If LSG‚Äôs bowlers can disrupt SRH‚Äôs power-packed top order, they might prevent another massive total.However, if the bowlers fail, LSG could be staring at another massive chase.While LSG's batting is strong, their middle-order inconsistency cost them their last game against Delhi Capitals.Despite a strong start from Mitchell Marsh and a late flourish from Nicholas Pooran, they lost momentum in the middle overs. This time, Pant will hope his batters step up if they are set a daunting target.With a high-scoring tournament already underway, Pant‚Äôs decision is a bold one.

Champions Return: Rohit, Hardik, Shreyas, Gambhir return after India's title triumph

Former cricketer Sunil Gavaskar has questioned whether current coach Gautam Gambhir will follow Rahul Dravid 's example of sharing prize money equally with support staff after India's Champions Trophy victory.The exact amount of prize money allocated to Gambhir and the support staff remains undisclosed.""After the ICC T20 World Cup win and the Board announcement of prize money, the then-coach Rahul Dravid, ever the team man, refused to accept more than his fellow members of the coaching staff and shared it equally with his colleagues,"" Gavaskar wrote in his column for""It's been a fortnight since the BCCI announced the Champions Trophy rewards, but we haven't heard anything from the current coach on whether he will also do a Dravid.

NEW DELHI: After losing their opening game to Royal Challengers Bengaluru, the defending champions finally gained momentum in their Indian Premier League title defense by defeating Rajasthan Royals by eight wickets at Guwahati‚Äôs ACA Stadium. While Kolkata Knight Riders skipper Ajinkya Rahane was denied favourable conditions at their home ground - Eden Gardens - in the opening match, the team thrived in Guwahati and secured their first win of the tournament. Quinton de Kock played a crucial role, scoring an unbeaten 97 runs to guide KKR to victory in style.Ahead of KKR's opening game against RCB at Eden Gardens, reports had suggested that pitch curator Sujan Mukherjee had denied skipper Rahane's request for a pitch that supported more spin.To this, Mukherjee had stated that the pitch would not change ‚Äúas long as I‚Äôm here.‚ÄùFormer New Zealand cricketer and commentator Simon Doull suggested that KKR should consider ‚Äúmoving the franchise away somewhere else.‚Äù‚ÄúIf he‚Äôs (the curator) not taking heed of what the home team wants‚Ä¶ I mean they are paying the stadium fees, they are paying for what‚Äôs going on in the IPL but if he‚Äôs still not paying heed of what the home team wants, then just move the franchise away to somewhere else.

Bombay Sports Exchange Episode 1: Interview with Sanjog Gupta, CEO (Sports) at JioStar

NEW DELHI: Kolkata Knight Riders had a disappointing start to their IPL 2025 campaign against Royal Challengers Bengaluru on March 22 at Eden Gardens, but they bounced back in style on Wednesday. The defending champions put up a commanding performance to register their first win of the season, securing two valuable points in the standings. The star of the night was Quinton de Kock , whose stellar knock powered KKR to an emphatic eight-wicket victory over Rajasthan Royals . This win also marked KKR‚Äôs first triumph under Ajinkya Rahane ‚Äôs captaincy.De Kock‚Äôs brilliance ensured that KKR remained in control throughout the chase. His combination of clean ball-striking and sharp game awareness reaffirmed why he is regarded as one of the most dangerous openers in the IPL. His innings was a textbook display of counter-attacking cricket‚Äîstarting with caution before seamlessly shifting gears to dismantle the opposition‚Äôs bowling attack with exquisite timing and brute power.With this dominant win, KKR not only got off the mark in IPL 2025 but also sent a strong statement to their rivals. Under Rahane‚Äôs leadership, the team has gained momentum, with de Kock leading the charge in spectacular fashion.Earlier in the match, Rahane won the toss and opted to field first, putting Rajasthan Royals on the back foot. Led by Riyan Parag, RR struggled to put up a competitive total as KKR‚Äôs disciplined bowling unit applied relentless pressure. Yashasvi Jaiswal (29 off 24) and Dhruv Jurel (33 off 28) were the only notable contributors as the Royals managed to post 151/9 in their 20 overs.KKR‚Äôs bowlers were clinical, with Varun Chakaravarthy (2/17) and Moeen Ali (2/23) stifling RR‚Äôs middle order, while Harshit Rana and Vaibhav Arora chipped in with crucial wickets to keep the total within reach.Chasing 152, KKR faced an early setback when opener Moeen Ali was run out for just 5. However, de Kock stepped up with an authoritative display, dismantling the RR bowling attack with a breathtaking array of strokes. Despite losing captain Rahane for 18, the South African wicketkeeper-batsman kept the chase on track with a flurry of boundaries and well-calculated big hits.De Kock‚Äôs explosive innings featured eight fours and six towering sixes, making light work of the Rajasthan bowling attack. His heroics ensured KKR cruised to victory with plenty of overs to spare.Next up, KKR will take on five-time champions Mumbai Indians at the Wankhede Stadium on Monday, looking to build on their newfound momentum.",Kolkata Knight Riders beat Rajasthan Royals by eight wickets in IPL 2025.

NEW DELHI: In a thrilling IPL encounter, Shardul Thakur 's impressive four-wicket haul and Nicholas Pooran 's sensational display of power-hitting guided Lucknow Super Giants ( LSG ) to a five-wicket victory over Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) on Thursday.Thakur's dream comeback continued as he returned with figures of 4/34, helping LSG restrict the formidable SRH batting lineup to 190/9.Pooran then took center stage, showcasing his 360-degree hitting prowess with a blistering 70 off just 26 deliveries, including six fours and six maximums. His partnership with Mitchell Marsh (52 off 31) yielded a match-winning 116 runs for the second wicket, propelling LSG to chase down the target in just 16.1 overs.Despite losing Aiden Markram early in their chase, LSG surged ahead thanks to the effortless hitting from Marsh and Pooran. Pooran, in particular, was at his attacking best, dealing primarily in sixes and clobbering Simarjeet and Abhishek Sharma for massive hits, mostly towards the square boundary.SRH found it challenging to contain Pooran as he didn't even spare Cummins, hitting him for two fours in his first over to reach 77/1 in the powerplay. Pooran brought up the fastest fifty of the season in just 18 balls with another colossal six over square leg off Adam Zampa's bowling.Cummins eventually trapped Pooran in front of the wickets in the ninth over, but Marsh took the onus upon himself and brought up his half-century off just 29 balls. Although LSG skipper Rishabh Pant (15 off 15) couldn't contribute much, Abdul Samad played an entertaining cameo to guide his side home.Earlier, after opting to bowl first, Shardul (4/34) provided LSG with a fiery start, removing Abishek Sharma and the previous match's centurion, Ishan Kishan, in consecutive balls in the third over. While Shardul sent Sharma packing with a short delivery, he dismissed Kishan caught behind off an innocuous delivery down the leg side.Travis Head (47 off 28), however, looked in ominous form as he took the attack to the opposition, using his brute power to deal in boundaries and sixes. Head was particularly brutal against Avesh Khan, hitting him for two sixes and one four to pick up 18 runs in the fourth over.Head was fortunate to receive two reprieves, but his luck eventually ran out when fast bowler Prince Yadav disturbed his timbers to claim his first IPL wicket.Henrich Klaasen (26 off 17) was run out in a bizarre fashion by Yadav off his own bowling, while young Aniket Verma played a 13-ball 36-run cameo that included five sixes before falling to leg-spinner Disvesh Rathi.SRH skipper Pat Cummins (18 off 4) hit three sixes off his first three balls before departing in style, contributing to SRH's competitive total of 190/9.",Lucknow Super Giants ( LSG) beat Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) by five wickets. Shardul Thakur (4/34) and Nicholas Pooran (70) guided LSG to victory. LSG chased down the target of 190 in 16.1 overs.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119610693,imgsize-176716,width-400,resizemode-4/119610693.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Former England fast bowler Peter Lever has passed away at the age of 84. Lever played a pivotal role in helping England win the 1970-71 Ashes series in Australia, where he showcased his exceptional bowling skills.During his international career, Lever represented England in 17 Test matches , claiming 41 wickets. He also featured in 10 one-day internationals , including the historic inaugural match in the format against Australia in 1971.Lever's Test debut came during the 1970-71 tour to Australia, where he played under the captaincy of Raymond Illingworth. His impressive performances in Australia continued in 1975, when he recorded his career-best Test figures of six for 38 in Melbourne.However, Lever's career was not without controversy.In the pre-helmet era, he was involved in a serious incident during a 1975 Test in Auckland against New Zealand. Lever struck Ewen Chatfield on the head with a bouncer, and the tail-ender's life was saved only through emergency medical treatment after his heart briefly stopped.Reflecting on the incident, Lever expressed remorse, stating, ""I honestly thought I had killed him as I saw him lying there in convulsions. I felt sick and ashamed at what I had done, and all I could think when I got back to the pavilion was that I wanted to retire.""Chatfield later convinced Lever that he was not to blame for the accident.Alongside his international exploits, Lever enjoyed a successful domestic career with English county Lancashire.He played 301 First-Class matches for the county between 1960 and 1976, taking an impressive 796 wickets.Lancashire paid tribute to Lever on social media, expressing their sadness at his passing.The county wrote, ""We are deeply saddened by the news that Peter Lever has passed away, aged 84. Peter was inducted into our Hall of Fame last year after playing 301 First-Class matches between 1960 and 1976 -- taking 796 wickets. Our thoughts are with his family and friends.""Lever's contribution to English cricket, both at the international and domestic levels, will be remembered fondly.His achievements, particularly his role in the 1970-71 Ashes triumph and his impressive county career with Lancashire, have cemented his legacy as a formidable fast bowler of his era.","Former England fast bowler Peter Lever has passed away at the age of 84.
