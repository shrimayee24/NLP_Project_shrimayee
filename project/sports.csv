Why Sushant Singh Rajput inspires this Left candidate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-sushant-singh-rajput-inspires-this-left-candidate/articleshow/124774479.cms,"Acting and activism

A different script

PATNA: The famous Sinha library was closed. But outside the gate, Divya Gautam, still in her teens and in the middle of a break from structured education, saw the poster of a film fest, named Cinema of Resistance. Some of the movies she saw that week, Iranian auteur Majid Majidi’s ‘Children of Heaven’, and the documentaries of displacement and forest rights by the Jharkhand filmmaker duo, Meghnath and Biju Toppo, including their aching ‘Gadi Lohardaga Mail’, stayed with her long after the lights came on.It was the beginning of a realisation for Divya that she wanted to do something different. “I wasn’t really interested in the bazaar of competitive examinations for wannabe engineers. I failed the tests,” says the 34-yearold theatre activist-cum-academic, also an unusual CPIML (Liberation) candidate contesting the Digha assembly seat in suburban Patna in the upcoming Bihar assembly elections Divya is also a cousin of Sushant Singh Rajput , the promising Hindi film star (‘Kai Po Che!’, ‘MS Dhoni: The Untold Story’, ‘Chhichhore’) who was found dead at his Mumbai residence in 2020.Sushant was five years older than her. Both started their acting careers in theatre. Then their trajectories changed. Sushant moved to Hindi cinema.After joining college, Divya found herself drawn towards Left cultural groups that reflected her own sensibilities.She started working in college theatre and with study groups associated with the radical Left party. In Patna College, the Saharsa-born daughter of an engineer and homemaker acted in plays like Mannu Bhandari’s ‘Mahabhoj’, discussed Occupy The Wall Street movement with fellow students and showed films such as ‘Modern Times’ to underline how capitalism dehumanises people.From culture, Divya gradually moved towards a more active role in campus politics. As a student of mass communication, she mobilised fellow students for better facilities at the department. “There was no camera, no newspaper, no studio, no library, only lectures,” she recalls. The movement achieved limited success.In 2012, Divya took the big step of agreeing to contest for the president’s post on an AISA ticket in the students’ union election. She lost narrowly to the ABVP candidate. This was also the time when she formally joined CPIML(L). When the Nirbhaya rape horror happened a few months later, she took to the streets, staging plays such as ‘Bekhauf Azaadi’ and highlighting the need for women’s agency and the importance of consent.It’s been a long and twisted journey since then. Divya has post-graduated in women’s studies from TISS, Hyderabad, worked on rural development and land rights in Jharkhand, cleared and dumped state civil service, taught mass communication in Patna’s Women’s College, and acted in Italian dramatist Dario Fo’s plays while working on her PhD on ‘Caste, class and masculinity in Bhojpuri stardom’. “I refused the govt job because I knew I won’t be able to speak up,” she says.A few weeks back when the party asked her to contest from Digha, a seat that BJP retained, polling 57% votes in 2020, she readily agreed. CPIML(L) had got 30% of the votes cast.Santosh Sahar of CPIML(L)’s central committee says that voters in Digha are predominantly middle class. “As an educated woman, who has always spoken up for gender rights, and has been committed to the rights of the marginalised, Divya was a good choice for the seat,” he says.Divya has started campaigning and says “there are so many issues”. “Unemployment, absence of quality education for the youth, migration... We have a Patliputra Industrial Area, but no industries,” she said.The activist-academic points to the city’s open drains, harassment of daily-wagers, atrocities against the urban poor and the ‘saffron’ politics of polarisation.She also talks about Sushant, who taught her mathematics when she was a kid and whose work she admires and is inspired by. “I remember him as an artiste,” she says. “No matter what, I will always do 1-2 plays every year. It will be my tribute to the theatre and him.”","Divya Gautam is contesting the Digha assembly seat in suburban Patna in the upcoming Bihar assembly elections.

Lack of real match practice for India’s star batters Virat Kohli Rohit Sharma , and Shreyas Iyer could hurt India’s ODI plans leading up to the 2027 World Cup. The recent Perth ODI against Australia was a small warning sign.Kohli, Rohit, and Iyer form India’s top four, but all three are currently playing only one format. Rohit and Virat have retired from T20Is and Tests, while Shreyas Iyer, who has taken a six-month break from red-ball cricket, is not part of India’s T20I setup for the upcoming World Cup in February next year.The Indian cricket team was slated to play 27 ODIs according to the ICC’s Future Tours Program (FTP) 2023–27. The three-match ODI series against Bangladesh, which was scheduled for August, has been postponed, and the first ODI at Perth was not a promising start for India’s quest for the 2027 ODI World Cup. Rohit, Virat, and Shreyas lasted just 46 balls between them, managing only 19 runs.Rohit and Virat were playing a competitive match after a gap of five months and looked rusty. Meanwhile, Shreyas, who has played for India A and in the Duleep Trophy, had his technical flaws exposed again. Both Josh Hazlewood and Mitchell Starc, who stand six feet six inches tall, have a high release point of almost 2.15 metres (nearly 7.05 feet).Whatever length they bowled, the duo generated extra bounce, with almost every ball hitting the top half of the bat. Perth was a bouncy track, and India’s top order looked all at sea.The ball that dismissed Rohit Sharma wasn’t particularly short, but it rose sharply to armpit height outside the off-stump, striking the upper portion of Rohit’s bat. He could have left it alone, but ended up poking at it. The unexpected bounce surprised him; yet it wasn’t due to the pitch — it was Hazlewood’s skill that gave it its sting.Virat Kohli, who registered his first duck on Australian soil, was also troubled by that length. Starc and Hazlewood had troubled Kohli in the past too. In 10 ODI innings, Hazlewood had dismissed Kohli five times — averaging a wicket every second innings. But it was Hazlewood’s new-ball partner, Starc, who sent Kohli back. Kohli went for a booming shot, chasing the ball away from his body, and Cooper Connolly, patrolling at backward point, took a spectacular catch. It was a shot born out of desperation to get off the mark, which we have rarely seen from Kohli in a format where he is an undisputed king.Meanwhile, Shreyas Iyer’s struggles against short-pitched balls are well documented. The newly appointed ODI vice-captain had been prolific in the last two 50-over ICC tournaments. In the Champions Trophy earlier this year, he was India’s leading run-getter with 243 runs in five innings. Iyer had hammered 530 runs during the 2023 ODI World Cup.He had been pivotal in India’s success in both tournaments, but in Perth, Hazlewood exposed a chink in Shreyas’ armour again. Relentless Hazlewood denied Shreyas any width, hitting the deck hard and creating an angle from a good length, which tangled Shreyas up. As he tried to adjust and negate the extra bounce, rising around his ribs, the ball ended up brushing his gloves.The three dismissals have raised eyebrows as the next World Cup will be held in South Africa, where pitches will be bouncy. India will play only two away ODI series to tackle the bounce factor: the ongoing three-match series against world champions Australia, and another against England in July 2026. However, the spice in English pitches has lessened, as it doesn’t suit their “Bazball” approach.In the case of Shreyas, he is playing for India A and, after taking a break from four-day cricket, will likely be available for Mumbai in the Vijay Hazare Trophy. But the big question is whether the two senior stars, Kohli and Rohit, will play domestic 50-over tournaments to stay match-ready. It doesn’t matter how hard they train in the nets; having played enough cricket, they know there is no substitute for real match scenarios.Since Rohit and Virat now play only one format, their rustiness was visible in the first outing. Playing just the IPL won’t guarantee them a spot in India’s 2027 ODI World Cup squad. If they want to pursue their broken November 19 dream and win the trophy in South Africa, they must play domestic cricket to stay match-fit. If they choose not to, they are doing a disservice to Indian cricket and their own reputations.After India’s Test series win against West Indies in New Delhi, coach Gautam Gambhir was asked , “Are Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli still part of India’s plans for the 2027 World Cup?”Gambhir said: “Look, the 50-over World Cup is still two-and-a-half years away, and it is very important to stay in the present. Obviously, they are quality players; their experience will be invaluable in Australia as well. Hopefully, those two will have a successful tour, and more importantly, the team will have a successful series.”Gambhir may have dodged the big question, but he knows the clock is ticking. If he and Shubman Gill want India to take a step forward in 2027, they will need their ageing superstars match-ready. If not, India must blood talents like Yashasvi Jaiswal and Tilak Verma, giving them limited matches to prepare for the 2027 ODI World Cup.","Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma and Shreyas Iyer produced paltry returns in the first ODI vs Australia in Perth.

Jason Kelce stands firm on retirement as family life takes center stage

Kylie Kelce is known for her humor, honesty, and no-nonsense approach to life and that includes how she managed her husband Jason Kelce’s on-field temperament during his NFL career. The wife of the retired Philadelphia Eagles center recently opened up on her Not Gonna Lie podcast about the one rule she made absolutely clear to Jason during his playing days, a rule that had everything to do with keeping their bank account safe from league fines.Speaking on the October 23 episode, the 33-year-old revealed her long-standing “pep talk” before every game. “What I did often, often remind him, was that if a fight broke out, that he better keep all 10 of his piggy toes on the outside of that field,” Kylie said.She added, “Because you wanna know another way they pop you? If you so much as step a foot onto that field when you were not previously on that field, while there is a fight happening, even if you went out there to break it up: Fine. Fine dollars out of your pocket into the NFL's.”Kylie, now a mother of four, added with a laugh, “They don’t f**k around with that. They do not f**k around with that.” Her rule was simple, avoid the chaos, avoid the fines.And she admits her husband wasn’t exactly the “peacekeeper” type in those moments.She further added, “As much as I would love to say that Jason would be the one that would hop in there and be the peacekeeper breaking it up, you and I both know… I’m pretty sure he was going and swinging.”Jason, who officially retired in early 2024, reaffirmed on his and brother Travis Kelce’s New Heights podcast that he’s “not coming out of retirement.” Laughing about his physical limits, he recalled spraining his calf jumping rope last year ,a clear sign, he said, that his body’s done with the NFL grind.Now fully focused on family life, Jason and Kylie are busy raising their daughters — Wyatt, Elliotte, Bennett, and baby Finn, while juggling media projects and their growing fame. But as Kylie’s hilarious NFL stories prove, she was always the real coach behind the scenes, keeping her husband grounded, and sometimes, out of trouble.Also Read: Taylor Swift’s ‘obsession’ shocks fans as rumors claim she’s fixated on another star — and it’s not Travis Kelce","Kylie Kelce revealed a unique pre-game ritual for her husband, NFL star Jason Kelce.

Pop star Madison Beer is entering a new chapter in her artistic journey, one that feels deeply intimate and reflective. The 25-year-old singer recently opened up about the inspiration behind her upcoming album Locket, which is set to release in January 2026. The project marks one of Beer’s most personal works yet, mirroring both her creative growth and emotional depth, something even her boyfriend, NFL quarterback Justin Herbert , seems to admire from the sidelines.During her appearance on The Travis Mills Show, Madison Beer explained that the idea for Locket came before she even began writing the songs. “When I went into this one though, I knew I wanted it to be something very personal to me and tangible,” she shared.“I don't know why but, my brain calls the shots and I'm just a passenger, so I was like ok, 'I'm going to think of things' and I wrote down a list of things that felt like they were a part of my life naturally... I really wanted something vintage and girly sounding and Locket was one of the words that was on there from the start. And I was like, 'I think this is the title.’”Her explanation reflected the same nostalgic and heartfelt tone fans have come to love in her music.Beer revealed that the songs came later and naturally tied into the album’s theme, which symbolizes cherished memories, much like the sentiment behind a locket itself. Even host Travis Mills noted she was wearing a locket necklace during the interview, a small but meaningful nod to her artistic vision.While Beer pours her heart into Locket, she’s also been seen supporting Justin Herbert during his NFL season. The couple made their relationship public when Beer appeared on the sidelines during the Los Angeles Chargers’ Week 5 game against the Washington Commanders, where the pair shared a warm embrace before kickoff.Though the Chargers lost that day, Herbert’s connection with Beer has been a bright spot for fans watching the duo balance fame and love across two demanding careers. As Locket nears release, it’s clear Madison Beer isn’t just creating music, she’s crafting a keepsake that represents her emotional evolution both on and off the stage.Also Read: Madison Beer relives heartbreak in ‘Bittersweet’ video featuring The Summer I Turned Pretty’s Sean Kaufman amid Justin Herbert romance","Madison Beer's upcoming album, 'Locket,' is set to release in January 2026.

It’s pretty hard to do when you have literally hundreds of millions of people that are watching.”He emphasized that the league aims to reflect its global audience, adding that Bad Bunny is “one of the leading and most popular entertainers in the world.”The 2026 Super Bowl halftime show, scheduled for February 8, is expected to celebrate Latin music and culture on one of the world’s biggest stages. For Goodell, it’s a statement of inclusion, not controversy and a recognition of how the NFL has evolved beyond its traditional image.However, Goodell’s decision has sparked intense criticism from the MAGA community. Commentators like TPUSA Live host Jon Root accused the NFL of being “out of touch,” writing, “No one wants to watch a subtitled Super Bowl Halftime show, from a dude that dresses in drag, makes demonic music, & who stated he wouldn’t perform in the US anymore because of ICE deporting illegal immigrants.”Root also claimed that Turning Point USA plans to host a counter halftime show featuring Kid Rock and Lana Trump.Despite the noise, the NFL appears unfazed. For many fans, Goodell’s defense of Bad Bunny is a rare moment where the league is choosing cultural authenticity over politics. With Bad Bunny’s immense global following and groundbreaking influence, this year’s halftime show may end up being one of the most-watched and most talked-about, in Super Bowl history.Also Read: “So proud”: Shakira praises Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl headline moment as a victory for Latin artists amid growing controversy","NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell has defended the decision to feature Bad Bunny at the Super Bowl LVIII halftime show.

A look inside Gisele’s post-divorce transformation and family-first life

Gisele Bündchen has once again proven that true wellness doesn’t come from luxury or fame but from simplicity and self-connection. The supermodel and philanthropist recently opened up about her personal way of handling anxiety and it’s not what many would expect from one of the world’s most glamorous women.The 45-year-old model took to Instagram this week to share her secret to staying grounded amid life’s chaos. Her advice was refreshingly straightforward: “Move your body.” Bündchen explained how physical activity helps her manage anxiety and stay mentally balanced.“When we’re stressed, our body tenses up.

Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce remain silent as speculation grows





A rumor surrounding Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce ’s wedding plans has taken an unexpected turn, sparking controversy and public debate about privilege, power, and ethics. The couple, who have been making headlines with their high-profile engagement, are now being accused of using their influence to secure a wedding venue that was already booked by another pair.According to circulating reports, Swift and Kelce’s team allegedly placed a massive bid on a location that had already been reserved by a non-celebrity couple for their own wedding. The offer was reportedly so high that it tempted the venue to reconsider its prior agreement, a decision that left the engaged couple “blindsided” and uncertain about their special day.The couple had spent months planning their wedding, confident that their chosen venue and date were secure. However, the alleged offer from Swift and Kelce’s representatives changed everything. The size of the bid, rumored to be far above standard rates, reportedly caused immense financial pressure on the venue owners, who began to waver in honoring their initial contract.What was once a time of excitement for the couple has now become filled with anxiety and disappointment. Social media users have voiced strong support for them, criticizing the idea that wealth and fame could override fairness and commitment.As one user quipped on X, “the only rationale for this is that Travis Kelce wants a wedding at Six Flags or that Taylor Swift is just a big fan of roller coasters.”Neither Taylor Swift nor Travis Kelce has commented on the controversy. Their silence has fueled mixed reactions with some fans believing the rumors might be exaggerated, while others see it as evidence of entitlement.Meanwhile, the public continues to discuss the broader issue this situation represents, how celebrity privilege can unintentionally harm ordinary people. Still, interest in the couple’s upcoming wedding remains sky-high. As Travis recently admitted, “At the game, it was my first time introducing Taylor as my fiancée to a few of my teammates. I still get giddy, it’s exciting times.”Whether the accusations prove true or not, one thing is certain, every move made by this power couple continues to captivate and divide public opinion.Also Read: “It’s not a pause.

Who is Oronde Gadsden II and a look at his road to the NFL



Oronde Gadsden II’s breakout impact in Los Angeles



The Los Angeles Chargers have stumbled in recent weeks after a perfect start to the season, dropping three of their last four games. Injuries and offensive struggles have allowed the Denver Broncos to seize the AFC West lead. Yet, there’s a bright spot for the Chargers: rookie tight end Oronde Gadsden II. Slowly but surely, he has become a key target for Justin Herbert , showing flashes of dominance that could change the trajectory of the Chargers’ offense.Born in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Gadsden grew up in a football household. His father, Oronde Gadsden, played in the NFL from 1995-2003 and won a Super Bowl with the Dallas Cowboys. Following in his father’s footsteps, Gadsden attended American Heritage High School in Plantation, Florida, helping his team secure two state championships while also playing lacrosse and running track. Originally a wide receiver, he transitioned into a tight end role during his college years at Syracuse University.At Syracuse, Gadsden experienced a mix of highs and setbacks. After catching just two passes as a freshman, he broke out in his sophomore season with 61 receptions for 969 yards and six touchdowns. A season-ending injury cut his junior year short, but he returned strong in his senior season, posting 73 catches, 934 yards, and seven touchdowns.Over his college career, he amassed 143 receptions, 1,994 receiving yards, and 14 touchdowns. His standout performances led him to declare for the 2025 NFL Draft, where the Chargers selected him in the fifth round with the 165th pick.Gadsden didn’t make an immediate splash in the NFL, but by Week 3, he was on the radar with his first reception. Weeks 6-8 cemented his status as a rising star. In Week 7 against the Colts, he recorded seven catches for 164 yards and a touchdown, signaling his emergence as a top offensive weapon. Fantasy managers have taken note, often starting him in their lineups as his production has continued.Even with injuries to key Chargers players like Omarion Hampton, Najee Harris, Joe Alt, and Rashawn Slater, Gadsden has provided stability in the passing game. In Thursday Night Football, he caught four passes for 37 yards and a touchdown in the first half alone, demonstrating his growing role as Justin Herbert’s primary receiving tight end. If he continues at this pace, Gadsden could become one of the league’s most reliable tight ends and a cornerstone for the Chargers’ offense.Also Read: J.J.

Toronto Maple Leafs struggle to replace Mitch Marner’s two-way impact

Mitch Marner's Top 10 Career Highlights

Marner’s success in Vegas highlights Toronto’s miss

Mitch Marner’s departure from the Toronto Maple Leafs is turning out to be a bigger loss than just losing a top playmaker. The summer deal, which sent him to the Vegas Golden Knights, has left Toronto searching for a proper mix, mainly in their defensive zone. While the likes of Auston Matthews and William Nylander keep on scoring, the overall team structure has become less reliable defensively. Marner’s contribution — in terms of both offense and defense — is showing to be a tougher task to fill in than commonsense estimates.There’s a tendency to point fingers whenever a sports team stumbles. But in the case of Toronto, instead of Matthews, Nylander, or John Tavares, the players under fire are those who are not even on the roster anymore. Mitch Marner is one such player who, through his absence, has cast a shadow over the current roster, as no one has been able to fill the void left by him.According to Jeff O'Neill, a former Leafs player and currently a TSN analyst, it seems like ""It feels like three Mitch Marner have left,"" which is quite a statement as it shows how vital he was in bringing balance to the team. Defensively speaking, the numbers of the Leafs have fallen alarmingly, which is why the team is letting in more than 3.5 goals per game, which places them among the worst in the whole NHL By the end of last season, Marner had established himself as one of the most reliable defensive forwards in the Leafs’ frontline, and he consistently ranked among the top in the league for takeaways and penalty-kill minutes. His instinctive play-reading ability and opponent disruption had often saved Toronto from getting into trouble. This year, the Leafs are encountering problems of odd-man rushes and collapses in defensive coverage that have already cost them some games.On the other hand, Mitch Marner has adapted perfectly with Vegas, and despite being a new player on the team, he has already contributed 10 points in the first seven games and has been one of the reasons why the team is still unbeaten in regulation. Vegas is the highest scoring team in the NHL at the moment, while Toronto is still looking for the right mix and chemistry in its redesigned squad.Craig Berube, the coach of the Blues, has recognized that the team is making errors that could be avoided, while Sheldon Keefe, the former coach of the Leafs and current coach of the Devils, has stated that Marner's two-way skills are unique and cannot be copied.Mitch Marner’s exit has deprived Toronto of more than just a superstar forward — he was a player who provided stability on both the offensive and defensive ends. Until the Leafs get back to the point where defensive play is their priority, their journey to becoming contenders again is still uncertain.Also Read: Connor Bedard’s life beyond the ice: Family and rumored love story behind hockey’s young star","Mitch Marner’s departure from the Toronto Maple Leafs is turning out to be a bigger loss than just losing a top playmaker.

Standing 6’11”, he excelled as both a power forward and center throughout his professional career. Before entering the NBA, Splitter achieved significant success in Europe, becoming a three-time All-EuroLeague Team selection.In 2007, the San Antonio Spurs drafted Splitter, marking the beginning of his NBA journey. His hard work and consistency eventually paid off when he became the first Brazilian-born player to win an NBA championship in 2014 with the Spurs.

How many snaps will Aaron Jones get if he plays?

Vikings also dealing with Christian Darrisaw injury concern

As of the latest official injury report from the Minnesota Vikings, Aaron Jones is still listed as questionable for tonight’s game. He has taken part in limited practice sessions this week but has not been confirmed as a full go. Reporters like Ian Rapoport and Tom Pelissero say the Vikings will wait until pregame warm-ups to decide if he is active. His status will likely be a game-time decision.Without Aaron Jones, the Vikings’ running game has lacked explosive plays. Jones is known for his speed, strong cuts, and ability to catch passes out of the backfield. In his last healthy season with the Green Bay Packers, he rushed for over 1,100 yards.The Vikings have used Jordan Mason and Ty Chandler in his absence, but neither has been able to match Jones’ game-changing style or experience in big moments.Even if Aaron Jones is active tonight, reports suggest the Vikings may limit his snaps to avoid any risk of re-injury.

Brock Boeser, the young star of the Vancouver Canucks, who did not play in the last two games for personal reasons, is now back in the team’s lineup for the upcoming match with the Nashville Predators. Besides, his return brings a ray of hope to the team and fans. The Canucks, who have been failing in the area of scoring goals consistently, are looking forward to the return of Boeser as a shooter and a leader who can support the team and bring back the lost energy as they try to win their last game on the road.Coach Adam Foote announced that Boeser will play with Max Sasson and Jake DeBrusk, while Elias Pettersson will be in the middle of Conor Garland and Evander Kane. Boeser, who has the most goals on the team this season with three, has demonstrated he can count on the Predators, scoring 15 points in 18 matches during his entire career.The player’s comeback has reestablished the equilibrium of the top six, bringing extra power and faith to the team of forwards. Goaltender Thatcher Demko keeps on doing great with a .922 save percentage, while Pettersson's better form hints at a stronger offensiveness.Experienced defenseman Quinn Hughes is still the one who supports the power play and penalty kill. Blowups of such talented players as Filip Chytil, Jonathan Lekkerimäki, and Teddy Blueger have given the Canucks faith in Boeser’s return as a potential game-changer.The announcement of Boeser’s comeback caused great excitement on social media, and the news spread like wildfire.@ForNarwhals couldn’t contain their joy and wrote very enthusiastically: “YIPPEE THE PRINCESS IS BACK!” while @604Powell had the cheeky question “Can he play center?” That was a typical fan’s optimistic attitude, however, very light-hearted at the same time.@marrrst was very grateful: “Oh thank GOD,” and @tatituzzi remarked, “So happy he’s back, hope everything is okay💙.”The like-mindedness of @schafer_von, who expressed trust: “Good. This will help out,” was echoed by @gluuten69, who put it very succinctly: “Hell yeah, that’s much needed.”Brock Boeser’s comeback is not only a roster update — it’s a beacon of faith for the Canucks. His presence back in the team could revive Vancouver’s offense, raise the spirits, and give the much-needed boost to the team to complete their road trip on a positive note. If Boeser gets into his groove from the very beginning, then the Predators might be up against a re-energized and willful Canucks team.Also Read: NHL Trade Rumor: Alex Tuch trade buzz intensifies as Edmonton Oilers eye roster","Brock Boeser, the young star of the Vancouver Canucks, is now back in the team’s lineup for the upcoming match with the Nashville Predators.

Charles Barkley roasted by Kenny Smith upon ESPN debut with a hilarious one line



""I was nervous today… Every person who’s ever touched a ball wanted to be on ESPN.

They are the greatest sports network ever. To be working with these guys is an honor and a privilege.""

""Do you want a napkin for all that kissing up you just did?""

""I saw you on ESPN today. Talking about kissing up. Does it taste like chicken? Oh, now we are sponsored by Popeyes.""

The elite panel of NBA icons, Shaquille O’Neal, Kenny Smith, and Ernie Johnson, made their return to ESPN's Inside the NBA crew show, with Charles Barkley marking his debut on the network alongside them. They have officially set the tone for the new 2025-26 NBA season under the ESPN banner. However, Barkley's first night turned into a roast fest as Smith took playful shots at Barkley that left him stunned and millions laughing.Charles Barkley said for years that he would never work with ESPN, often taking shots at their grueling schedule and overworked staff. However, ESPN took over the reins of Inside the NBA after the association's contract with TNT ended; it was a completely different scenario.In his debut appearance, Barkley made a humble statement about ESPN, saying,This came as a major surprise to the NBA fans, who were aware of his previous thoughts about the company. This led to his fellow host, Kenny Smith, taking a shot at him, saying,Smith's hilarious jab at Barkley led to the entire set cracking up. After all, it was someone who had fired shots at ESPN for years and now praised the same network due to new work commitments with them. Smith was later reminded of his appearance on First Take by Barkley, who got back at him for his roast, saying,With Inside the NBA on ESPN, it is unlikely that Charles Barkley and his company would be appearing weekly as a cohesive panel. This is primarily due to the network already having multiple NBA shows like NBA Countdown. At the same time, the panel of Barkley, O’Neal, Smith, and Johnson will appear majorly for marquee matchups and playoff runs. With an assembled cast of top basketball icons combined with analysis, insights, and playful jabs, it will surely be an interesting show to tune into for the new NBA season.Also read: Washington Wizards vs Milwaukee Bucks (22-10-2025): Box score, player stats, game summary and more","Charles Barkley made his debut on ESPN's Inside the NBA.

From Ongoing Suspicion to Terry Rozier’s Arrest

Why This is Another Blow to NBA’s Gambling Integrity

Miami Heat and NBA Await Next Steps

was taken into federal custody early Thursday morning, October 23, 2025, as part of a massive FBI-led investigation into illegal sports betting. The arrest, confirmed by multiple national outlets, adds another chapter to a growing controversy that has followed Rozier since 2023 and now threatens to further test the NBA’s integrity measures.According to reports, Terry Rozier was arrested before sunrise at a hotel in Orlando - just hours after the Miami Heat dropped their season opener to the Magic. Notably, Rozier did not play in the game, as head coach Erik Spoelstra listed him as a healthy scratch. Federal authorities from the Eastern District of New York, joined by FBI Director Kash Patel, are expected to hold a joint press conference later today to announce the details of the case and outline the scope of the investigation.The origins of the case trace back to March 23, 2023, when Terry Rozier, then playing for the Charlotte Hornets, logged just ten minutes against the New Orleans Pelicans before leaving the game with what the team described as a “foot injury.” That matchup quickly drew the attention of sportsbook regulators across multiple states after a surge of wagers was placed on the under for Rozier’s points, rebounds, and assists.Those bets all cashed after his early exit, leading to the temporary suspension of Hornets-related betting markets.Federal investigators now believe that this unusual activity links Rozier to a larger gambling network - one connected to the same circle involved in the Jontay Porter scandal. Porter, a former Toronto Raptors center, was banned for life in 2024 after being found guilty of manipulating his own game outcomes to influence prop bets.Terry Rozier, 31, has reportedly been under investigation for months. Earlier this year, federal prosecutors in New York subpoenaed betting records and player prop data tied to his 2023 performances. While the NBA initially stated that Rozier had not violated league policy, a spokesperson confirmed that the organization had been cooperating with federal authorities.The Thursday morning arrest marks the first time Rozier faces direct legal consequences. Although the official charges have not been publicly revealed, multiple sources indicate that prosecutors are exploring potential offenses such as betting manipulation and wire fraud.This development underscores a growing challenge for the NBA as it navigates the complicated intersection between sports and legalized betting. The league’s deep financial partnerships with sportsbooks have made it increasingly vulnerable to integrity breaches centered around player-specific prop bets.Like the Porter case, Rozier’s alleged involvement raises questions about how easily such betting patterns can be exploited - and how the league plans to safeguard against future incidents. The recurrence of similar situations highlights the need for stronger internal monitoring and collaboration with gaming regulators.The Miami Heat organization has yet to release a formal statement. However, team sources have described the FBI’s pre-dawn action as a “complete surprise.” Terry Rozier’s future with the team and his eligibility to play in the NBA are now in serious jeopardy.If investigators uncover even indirect ties between Rozier and manipulated betting activity, the league could impose a lifetime ban - consistent with the precedent established in Porter’s case.As the Department of Justice prepares to address the media later today, the Terry Rozier case stands as another stark reminder of how the rise of legalized gambling continues to blur the lines of integrity in professional sports.Also read: “I Won’t Play Until 40 - A Hundred Percent”: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander Explains Why He Isn’t Chasing a Long NBA Legacy For now, both Miami Heat fans and NBA followers await answers - wondering whether Terry Rozier will become the latest cautionary example in an era where the fusion of basketball and betting has never been more perilous.","Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier was arrested Thursday morning in Orlando as part of a federal investigation into illegal sports betting.

If investigators uncover even indirect ties between Rozier and manipulated betting activity, the league could impose a lifetime ban.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124762998,imgsize-57994,width-400,resizemode-4/124762998.jpg"

The NBA is facing a stunning scandal asand Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier were arrested and charged in connection with an extensive federal investigation into illegal gambling operations. Law enforcement officials have revealed that Billups is accused of running an illicit poker ring tied to Mafia interests, while Rozier faces charges linked to a separate but related case involving professional basketball players using insider information to place illegal bets.Chauncey Billups, a Hall of Fame player and NBA champion with a celebrated 17-year career, was taken into custody in Oregon. Remarkably, he had coached Portland in the season opener the night before his arrest.Terry Rozier, a veteran guard for the Miami Heat, was detained in Orlando early Thursday morning, immediately following Miami’s season-opening game against the Orlando Magic. Although in uniform, Rozier did not play due to a hamstring injury.The arrests stem from a sweeping FBI investigation that has implicated roughly two dozen individuals, including members and associates of organized crime. Terry Rozier is among six people charged with turning professional basketball into a criminal gambling operation by exploiting confidential information for illegal wagers.Chauncey Billups, meanwhile, is charged with operating a poker ring with direct Mafia connections, illustrating the organized and far-reaching nature of these criminal activities.This case recalls prior NBA controversies. Last year, former Toronto Raptors forward Jontay Porter pleaded guilty to wire fraud and received a lifetime ban from the league after betting against his own team, faking an injury, and sharing confidential game details. Terry Rozier had been under scrutiny since 2023 for suspicious betting activity during his tenure with the Charlotte Hornets, including leaving a game early with a questionable foot injury - an event that coincided with unusual betting patterns on his performance.The timing of these arrests, coinciding with the start of the 2025-26 NBA season, appears carefully coordinated to maximize public attention. Experts note that high-profile criminal operations are often timed for maximum media impact, potentially creating reputational damage for the league. The FBI, under Director Kash Patel, planned a press conference to provide further details, signaling the gravity and visibility of the case.For fans and analysts, these developments highlight a troubling intersection between sports, crime, and gambling. The NBA now faces intense scrutiny over how it addresses insider threats while protecting the integrity of professional basketball.

Because I received this two days ago from a friend of mine, chess fan, and at least did what I could to warn people to do something urgently in my posts. To those who prefer blaming and shaming instead of helping. Awful tragedy, hope properly investigated.""Before Naroditsky’s death was confirmed, Kramnik had posted several tweets suggesting the streamer was “on something else than sleeping pills.”After the news broke, he continued to criticize those close to Naroditsky, alleging they ignored signs of serious problems.In another tweet, he wrote, ""Too high price paid, but if I was the only person shouting about obvious long-term problems of Danya becoming alarming, requiring urgent measures from people around, while 'friends' only cared about hiding it and erase evidence, it’s rotten to the core.""The controversy that cast a long shadow over Daniel Naroditsky's final year commenced when Vladimir Kramnik publicly accused him of cheating through a series of online posts in early 2024.Kramnik alleged that Naroditsky used a second screen to consult chess engines, a serious accusation undermining the integrity of a professional player. Naroditsky, ranked among the world's top 75 in Rapid and top 25 in Blitz, had to defend himself in the court of public opinion.He strongly denied the allegations, stating that his streaming setup had been misinterpreted by Kramnik.

After a picturesque Lake Muskoka wedding in July 2024, the couple, who share a Bernedoodle, navigate their successful careers while prioritizing mutual growth and connection, offering a grounded model of enduring love amidst fame.

From engagement to a dream wedding on Lake Muskoka

Balancing two careers while staying grounded and connected

The romance between NHL superstar Connor McDavid and interior-designer-turned-entrepreneur Lauren Kyle is one built on shared growth, mutual support and thoughtful intention. Their journey began back in 2016 when Kyle’s cousin, also McDavid’s teammate, set them up on a blind date. From that moment on, the pair began weaving together their lives, both personally and professionally.Kyle holds her own spotlight. A Canadian native, she earned a bachelor’s degree in interior design from Toronto’s Ryerson University before launching her own firm, Kyle & Co. Design, in 2019. Meanwhile, McDavid was carving out his legacy in the NHL as captain of the Edmonton Oilers, already a multiple-time All-Star and major award winner.Their relationship deepened steadily, and in June 2023, after nearly eight years of dating, McDavid proposed in Muskoka, Ontario, leading Kyle down a deck strewn with flowers to a heartfelt moment she described: “I cannot put into words how happy I am to be spending the rest of our lives together. Almost eight years of growth, happiness and so much love and I can’t believe we have so much more to look forward to.”The couple’s wedding took place on July 27, 2024, at Old Woman Island on Lake Muskoka, a picturesque, boat-access only setting.They hosted a multi-day celebration with multiple dress changes for the bride and a floating dock ceremony feature.

Kyle has spoken candidly about the behind-the-scenes of being a “hockey wife,” emphasizing that while the headlines may focus on the glamour, “People don’t know about the struggles that are on the inside … I just quiet that noise, because there’s a lot more positivity than negativity out there. ”On the other side, McDavid has acknowledged that part of the foundation for his success has been having Kyle by his side, not just as a partner but as a leader in her own right. Together, they continue to live in Edmonton, share a Bernedoodle named Lenard, and support each other’s paths in a way that feels authentic, intentional and rooted in growth.By prioritizing each other’s aspirations and staying grounded amidst fame, Connor and Lauren’s story offers a refreshing model of love that evolves, uplifts and endures.Also Read: Connor McDavid breaks longest career goal drought in Oilers’ overtime victory over Senators","Connor McDavid and Lauren Kyle's romance was sparked by a blind date in 2016.

Insider update on Carter Hart’s progress shocks fans as Golden Knights plan major move,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/insider-update-on-carter-harts-progress-shocks-fans-as-golden-knights-plan-major-move/articleshow/124753645.cms,"Vegas Golden Knights are reportedly set to offer goaltender Carter Hart a significant contract following his professional tryout. Despite off-ice controversies, Hart has impressed during practice, and with starter Adin Hill injured, Vegas seeks to stabilize their goaltending. This move offers Hart a second chance after legal proceedings, potentially proving a valuable, albeit debated, acquisition for the team.

Vegas looks ready to bet big on Carter Hart’s comeback

From scandal to second chance in Vegas

The Vegas Golden Knights are once again in the spotlight after making a bold move that’s dividing fans across the hockey world. The team recently signed goaltender Carter Hart to a professional tryout contract (PTO), a decision that came with heavy scrutiny due to the off-ice controversies surrounding him. Now, according to NHL insider Frank Seravalli, Vegas might be ready to double down on that gamble, by offering Hart a major contract once he becomes eligible to return to league play on December 1.Despite being unable to suit up for NHL games until December, Hart has been practicing with the Golden Knights and reportedly impressing team officials. Seravalli shared on Insider Notebook that “We fully expect that that tryout agreement will transform into a 1 or 2 year deal, that’s one of the things the Golden Knights and Carter Hart’s camp are still sorting out.”He previously mentioned Hart could command an average annual value around $2 million, a figure that has fans split, some calling it excessive for a goalie who hasn’t played competitively in nearly two years.But Vegas may not have much of a choice. The team’s starting goaltender Adin Hill has been ruled out week-to-week with a leg injury, forcing the Golden Knights to promote Carl Lindbom from their AHL affiliate. With Akira Schmid expected to shoulder a heavier workload, the franchise seems eager for Hart to step in and stabilize the crease once he’s cleared to play.Drafted by the Philadelphia Flyers in 2018, Hart’s NHL career was derailed in early 2024 when he parted ways with the team amid legal proceedings connected to a 2018 Hockey Canada incident. Earlier this summer, he and four others, Alex Formenton, Michael McLeod, Dillon Dube, and Cal Foote, were acquitted of all charges. Since then, Hart has been the only one of the five to secure a new NHL opportunity.For the Golden Knights, signing Hart is both a risk and a potential redemption story. If he can shake off the rust and deliver the level of play that once made him Philadelphia’s franchise goalie, Vegas might have found a timely, if controversial, solution to their goaltending woes.Also Read: Sidney Crosby’s candid revelation sheds light on why Penguins are dominating the early NHL games",Vegas Golden Knights are reportedly set to offer goaltender Carter Hart a significant contract.

Billups, who had been leading the Blazers since the 2021–22 season, now faces serious federal charges linked to a sophisticated, mafia-backed poker operation that defrauded wealthy participants of tens of millions of dollars.According to federal documents, the operation - believed to be connected to members of the Bonano, Gambino, and Genovese crime families - used cutting-edge cheating technology to rig high-stakes poker games. The tools allegedly included X-ray poker tables, specially designed contact lenses, and manipulated shuffle machines that allowed insiders to see opponents’ cards. Billups was reportedly used to attract high-net-worth individuals to these exclusive games, which investigators say had been running since at least 2019.The 2004 NBA Finals MVP and Hall of Famer was arrested in Portland and charged with wire fraud and money laundering.His arrest forms part of a wider FBI probe that has also implicated Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier in a related gambling case. Both men have been placed on immediate administrative leave by their teams while the league cooperates with federal authorities.In the wake of Billups’ arrest, the Portland Trail Blazers moved swiftly to stabilize their coaching staff. Assistant coach Tiago Splitter, 40, was named interim head coach. Though he is new to Portland’s bench this season, Splitter arrives with an impressive coaching résumé. He previously served as an assistant for the Brooklyn Nets and the Houston Rockets, and he enjoyed success overseas as the head coach of Paris Basketball, guiding the French club to its first national championship and a EuroLeague playoff berth.Before transitioning to coaching, Tiago Splitter had a decorated playing career spanning seven NBA seasons, most notably with the San Antonio Spurs, where he won an NBA championship in 2014. His experience as both a player and coach has earned him respect across the basketball world, and many see his appointment as a steadying force during one of the most turbulent moments in franchise history.Tiago Splitter’s first game as interim head coach is set for Friday, when the Portland Trail Blazers host the Golden State Warriors. For Splitter, this marks his first opportunity to lead an NBA team as head coach - a challenge he takes on amid immense scrutiny and uncertainty surrounding the team’s future.The NBA has emphasized that it views these developments with the utmost seriousness, reiterating its commitment to protecting the integrity of the game. League officials are working closely with federal investigators as the full scope of the illegal gambling operation continues to unfold.As the Trail Blazers attempt to regroup, Splitter now carries the responsibility of guiding a young, talented roster through the fallout of this scandal.

FBI Arrests NBA Stars In Gambling Case, Kash Patel Reveals Explosive Details

Hidden high-stakes games and shocking secrets shake the NBA as players come under FBI investigation

The FBI's extensive investigation into illicit sports gambling has identified four NBA teams who are allegedly involved in this. As part of an investigation into illicit sports gambling and poker rigging schemes reportedly supported by the Mafia, Portland Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups, Miami Heat forward Terry Rozier, and tons of other current and former players were charged with federal crimes. Investigators have claimed that the whole thing has affected games played by the Portland Trail Blazers, Los Angeles Lakers, Toronto Raptors, and Charlotte Hornets.Authorities said on Thursday that Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier is one of the individuals reportedly indicted in the illegal gambling case, while Portland Trail Blazers head coach Chauncey Billups is one of those charged in a reportedly illegal poker operation connected to the Mafia.FBI Director Kash Patel said during a news conference that more than 30 people were arrested in 11 states as a result of the unusual federal takedown on allegations of wire fraud, money laundering, extortion, robbery, and unlawful gambling.According to the NBA, both were put on leave right away by their organizations. The NBA said in a statement:""We are in the process of reviewing the federal indictments announced today.. Terry Rozier and Chauncey Billups are being placed on immediate leave from their teams, and we will continue to cooperate with the relevant authorities.We take these allegations with the utmost seriousness, and the integrity of our game remains our top priority.""According to the U.S. Attorney Joseph Nocella Jr., the poker games were allegedly rigged in favour of the people running them using sophisticated technology, including rigged shuffling machines and even X-ray technology to read cards facing down on the table. The games also featured basketball players to add legitimacy to their authenticity.Additionally, the FBI's New York Field Office assistant director in charge, Christopher Raia, described the defendants as part of a ""massive, nationwide takedown"" related to two distinct illicit poker and sports betting schemes.According to investigators, 13 Mafia members and associates from the Bonano, Gambino, and Genovese crime families are among the defendants, along with current and past NBA coaches and players.Rozier and former Cleveland Cavaliers player and assistant coach Damon Jones have also been detained in what officials called an ""overlapping"" investigation involving prop betting on NBA games.According to reports, Rozier and Jones allegedly gave four co-defendants inside information, which they then allegedly shared with a network of sports bettors. These gamblers allegedly used retail betting establishments or internet sports books, which forbid betting on confidential information.The former Charlotte Hornets player is scheduled to be arraigned inside the federal courthouse in Orlando, Florida, where he was detained Thursday morning. According to officials, games were held in Miami, Las Vegas , Manhattan, and the Hamptons starting in 2019.The suspected poker operation reportedly generated up to $7 million in revenues ""and counting,"" according to officials. NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch stated that the probe spanned two years.According to the NYPD, the mob defendants used violence against victims who refused to pay, some of whom lost millions. Kash Patel further said:""The fraud is mindboggling.. We're talking about tens of millions of dollars in theft, in fraud, in robbery.""Meanwhile, Billups is being investigated by law enforcement four months after Gilbert Arenas , another NBA star, was arrested and charged by the U.S. Attorney's Office for allegedly helping in the operation of illicit, high-stakes poker games out of Arenas' home in the Los Angeles area.Also read: Terry Rozier net worth: Miami Heat player's NBA journey takes an unexpected turn as he finds himself at the center of a gambling storm","The FBI's extensive investigation into illicit sports gambling has identified four NBA teams who are allegedly involved in this.
