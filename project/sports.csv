'We don't look at averages and stats': Gautam Gambhir on sending Axar Patel at No. 5

NEW DELHI: Eyebrows were raised when India announced five spinners in the team for the ICC Champions Trophy . Historically, the pitches in Dubai do not overly favour spinners. However, the venue has also just got done with the month-long ILT20 league which may have left the pitches tired and more amenable to spin. Predominantly, though, India’s spinner-heavy squad was chosen to lengthen the batting lineup, TOI has learnt.The trend emerging from head coach Gautam Gambhir ’s tenure is the inclination to have more allrounders in the lineup across formats. Gambhir has been vocal about the need to bat deep. Seambowling allrounders are a rarity at the moment. Hence, Washington Sundar too has made the cut along with Axar Patel and Ravindra Jadeja Interestingly, it was Gambhir who insisted on having Shivam Dube back in the ODI scheme of things by adding him to the list of non-travelling reserves, say insiders.Gambhir is someone who prefers to have more options in the playing XI. More allrounders give him the chance to be flexible. If India advance in the tournament, spinners are likely to play a greater role.The idea, according to those in the know of developments, is simple — play two steady finger-spinners who can bat well to complement either Kuldeep Yadav or Varun Chakravarthy . Kuldeep and Chakravarthy are seen as genuine strike options. If the pitches at the start look like they can produce big runs, one might see Chakravarthy in the XI ahead of Kuldeep. The majority of Chakravarthy’s wickets have come while the batters have been looking to push the scoring rate. Kuldeep is seen as someone who can deceive the batter in the air and lure him into a false shot, like he did against England in the last ODI in Ahmedabad on Wednesday.Also See: Champions Trophy Schedule 2025 There are other factors too. India have played two Asia Cups at the venue over the last seven years and never played more than two frontline spinners in the XI.Jasprit Bumrah’s absence and Mohammed Shami being rusty after a long injury layoff has played a part in India picking a spin-heavy attack which can compensate for the inexperience of the two new pacers, Harshit Rana and Arshdeep Singh. It will be interesting to see how India’s campaign unfolds on the Dubai pitches, which usually sport a layering of grass to prevent the surface from cracking up.","The trend emerging from head coach Gautam Gambhir ’s tenure is the inclination to have more allrounders in the lineup across formats.

Their romance blossomed into the spotlight after Gondrezick was spotted cheering him on during the Celtics' triumphant championship parade.In July 2024, the Boston Celtics player walked the ESPY Awards carpet with WNBA free agent Kysre Gondrezick, confirming their relationship.

Fans quickly noticed that Gondrezick was with Brown as he celebrated at the parade in Boston after he and the Celtics secured the championship victory in June 2024.Although the official explanation for the breakup has not been made public, insiders indicate that a variety of factors may have played a role in this decision. The overwhelming media attention that often surrounds high-profile athletes can be incredibly taxing, leaving very little opportunity for personal space and privacy.

Darick Hall Seizes Opportunity to Compete for First Base Role as Pirates Look for Power at the Plate

Darick Hall Takes Batting Practice with Pittsburgh Pirates! (2025 MLB Spring Training)

The Pirates, perhaps quite recently, have stubbed their toe on a diamond-in-the-rough or mighty bat poised to take a swing toward spring training glory. With first baseman Spencer Horwitz now lost to an uncertain amount of time due to a right wrist injury, a major opportunity has fallen to eager minor leaguer and another signee of the Pirates, Darick Hall . Hall signed a minor league contract with the team in December, subsequently landing himself a nifty golden ticket: the chance to claim the first base spot in spring training.You could safely say that Derek Shelton , manager of the Pirates, is quite excited about this new opportunity. About Hall, Shelton had only nice things to say, especially when it came to that big stick of his. ""He's definitely going to be in the competition,"" Shelton claimed to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, ""A big-body guy with the ability to have good at-bats and hit the ball out of the park."" We've seen him do it before in the big leagues, and we like the bat. We know what he brings.""Now, to those not in the know, this is the story of perseverance and hard work that got Darick Hall to this moment. Hall was drafted 14th overall by the Philadelphia Phillies in the 2016 MLB Draft and, after slogging it out in the minors for several years, made his long-awaited debut, at last, in 2022. Over 42 games, his display was condensed into a .250/.282/.522 line with the help of nine impressive home runs. Not bad for a rookie. Too bad, however, it was still not enough to secure Hall a place on the postseason roster during the Phillies' World Series run.But in baseball, they always say the game is about second chances-and Hall is about ready to grab his. In 2023, he made the Opening Day roster to fill in while stars Bryce Harper and Rhys Hoskins were recovering from injuries. Unfortunately, a thumb injury requiring surgery cut Hall's shot with the ball club short, but that didn't shake his determination.Now comes Hall's time to shine with a new opportunity against the Pirates. The Grapefruit League is starting, and Hall is ready to showcase to the world that a bat of his caliber belongs in the big, and the Pirates may just have stumbled upon a sleeper candidate who could make some noise at first base. Watch out, the world of baseball-Hall is showing up and showing out!","Darick Hall was drafted 14th overall by the Philadelphia Phillies in the 2016 MLB Draft.

"“He’s Excellent in Those Situations,” vouches former Colorado QB Joel Klatt for NFL legend Deion Sanders’ son, Shedeur Sanders",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/hes-excellent-in-those-situations-vouches-former-colorado-qb-joel-klatt-for-nfl-legend-deion-sanders-son-shedeur-sanders/articleshow/118257461.cms,"(Image via Getty)

“He’s got the precise ability to be a surgeon,” states Longtime FOX Analyst Joel Klatt about Colorado QB Shedeur Sanders

The Joel Klatt Show: A College Football Podcast,

“Here’s the reason. Sheduer has the beautiful combination of the ability to be a prototypical passer from the pocket. And he’s got the precise ability to be a surgeon in those cases. He also has the ability to be an artist, and that combination doesn’t come around a lot.”

The Eddie Crowder awardee, Joel Klatt, compared QB Shedeur Sanders to the 85 YO Minnesota Vikings quarterback Fran Tarkenton

“His (Shedeur's) ability to create outside of the pocket and extend the play is Fran Tarkenton-esque. He’s excellent in those situations. If you give him some time in the pocket, which Colorado did not generally do with that offensive line.

If he has time and he can diagnose what’s going on, he can be surgical in the pocket. I believe that he has a chance to be much better in the NFL than he was even at Colorado.”

Fran Tarkenton Highlights (Final Version)

Colorado Buffaloes quarterback Shedeur Sanders’ favorite team is the Tennessee Titans, but former QB Joel Klatt says otherwise

Unc & Ocho debate if New York Giants should select Shedeur Sanders in 2025 NFL Draft | Nightcap

“I don’t think Shedeur Sanders is going to want to play No. 1 in Tennessee, and I do not believe that any other players should be taken No. 1.

Tennessee can either not take him and go with Cam Ward at No. 1. Or I think they can get some capital. Still, fall back and potentially get Cam Ward. I believe Tennessee trades the first pick.

I believe that the Giants jump to No. 1, from three to one. They do have a great relationship with Shedeur Sanders. They have vetted him out several times. I believe that it is reciprocal.”

And I went on a road trip right after we started watching it, and I just took off. I think I came back from the road trip on season five,” he continued.Ayesha was quick to respond to Curry’s comment, she said, “And then years later the family’s like, ‘It’s the final episode! We’re going to have a watch party!’”Sadly for Ayesha, she was not up to date when the proposal for the watch part for the final episode was raised which created a family drama. “And I’m like, ‘I haven’t seen it. But I’ll take one of those special Khaleesi margaritas while you guys enjoy.”Regardless, Curry proudly announced, “I have a Ned Stark sword in my man cave.”It was not the first time Curry gained attention for his enthusiasm for Game of Thrones.

Joey Gallo joins White Sox on Minor League Deal – is this the comeback to revive his slugger status?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/mlb/news/joey-gallo-joins-white-sox-on-minor-league-deal-is-this-the-comeback-to-revive-his-slugger-status/articleshow/118257835.cms,"<p>Image via:Getty Images<br></p>

From Free Agent to Minor Leaguer: Can Joey Gallo Reignite His Career with the White Sox?



Joey Gallo Breaks Statcast With MONSTER DONG

In a situation unheard-of concerning historical precedence, the Chicago White Sox offered a minor-league contract and a spring-training invitation to non-roster player Joey Gallo , an ex-two-time All-Star. Gallo—once a home-run machine with the Texas Rangers and New York Yankees—will now attempt to crack again with his emergence as a free agent after the Washington Nationals just this past November chose to opt out of an $8 million mutual option. So, does that mean either he sets up a bomb squad or wildly misses?For those who remember Gallo's pride of All-Star gallantry in days gone by—ah the great days when he was a scourge to pitchers—this deal might appear to be a worthy home run. Yet for others who can only watch on as Gallo's batting average hits a free fall , , not prejudging really seems hard. His Yankee career was a whirlwind: mammoth home runs…then mammoth strikeouts. The only consistency in Gallo's play reflected that of Chicago weather: one day sunny and full of promise, the next a gale blow from the cold with everybody wondering where it went wrong.Following a complete gutting-session of a rebuilding season, the White Sox hope Gallo can add some pop to their lacking lineup. Gallo offers the excitement of left-handed power in a very uninspiring roster. His ability to crush right-handed pitching is exactly what the Sox could use—some serious hurting, with a big dose of strikeouts along the way.However, his being in spring training must not earmark him for a ticket straight to the majors. He'll have to prove himself in what should be a very competitive child. Will he find the sweet spot and channel the power that once made him one of the game's most-feared sluggers, or will he simply be a project added to the growing White Sox list?In any event, the signing piques interest, foments a few laughs, and provides a great deal of hope for the future. In or around spring training, the baseball world will be watching with bated breath to see if Joey Gallo can swing his way back into relevance or if his White Sox chapter was just a brief one.",The Chicago White Sox offered a minor-league contract and a spring-training invitation to Joey Gallo.

How did Jim Duquette react to Alex Bregman's Boston Red Sox signing?

“This is a far different, far different team than what they’ve had over the past couple of years. Bregman isn’t a 30 to 35 home run guy every year but he rakes, first off, at Fenway Park. Second of all, he’s a 25-home run guy maybe.""

""Hopefully, he’ll get back to his idea of the strike zone, not chasing. He’s never really chased, he’s always been a contact guy too — a pull hitter as we’ve talked about a lot. This is a really, almost perfect fit for him offensively,""

""Yep. 3 years and 120 with opt outs sounds better to me too. Damn. Tomorrow will be a great day for the Detroit Tigers to trade for Alex Bregman.""

Red Sox manager Alex Cora compares Alex Bregman with Dustin Pedroia

""As a person, he’s a kid that I really respect. We went through a lot for a while there. We have a good relationship. He’s very similar to Dustin (Pedroia) as far as the ‘baseball rat’ that he is. We'll see what happens.""

“I never thought that he was going to be a Gold Glove third baseman. I was like, ‘Man, this kid is going to be good at second.’ It just happened that the guy [José Altuve] that is playing second base [in Houston], he's going to be a Hall of Famer.”

Kevin Kiermaier steps into coaching role with the Blue Jays, ready to mentor young outfielders



Kevin Kiermaier talks about new role with Blue Jays | Hot Stove

Kevin Kiermaier, the four-time Gold Glove-winning outfielder, has hung up his cleats for a clipboard to join the Toronto Blue Jays coaching staff as a special assistant and outfield guru. It appears the man that wowed fans with his impossible catches and laser-accurate throws is now imparting that magic to the next generation of outfielders.Kevin Kiermaier, freshly retired after a season under the Jays, took a moment to explain why he is looking toward coaching: Outfield is his thing and he wants to teach it. On MLB Network, he was adamant: He wants to impart the knowledge he has garnered over years of chasing fly balls and saving runs so that the next group of players can achieve their potential.Kiermaier, with that smile that could make any Blue Jays fan's heart skip a beat, said: ""Outfield is my thing, and I just wanna teach it to the next group of players coming up."" Although he never wowed anyone with his offensive numbers (career-low .246 hitter, for the stat geeks), Kiermaier was in a whole different ball park altogether with his defense.Consistency was really what defined him; making jaw-dropping plays look routine won him Gold Gloves along the way, including one for his efforts with the Blue Jays in 2023. Grace and precision in roaming the outfield are what make him the perfect fit for the role. After all, whom better than the guy who could almost predict the path of a baseball with the same accuracy as a magician reading through a crystal ball to teach the finer points of reading a fly ball?Kiermaier's coaching position will surely benefit Toronto's outfield players. Having been on the biggest stage assisting the Rays to the World Series in 2020, he brings not only technical skills, but the wisdom that comes from playoff-level pressure.The Jays find themselves with bona fide outfield expertise on the staff, some fueled with enough fire for it to turn their next crop of outfielders into Gold Glove contenders. While switching from player to coach might be a substantial transition, for Kevin Kiermaier, it is just one more opportunity to fly high.","Kevin Kiermaier, the four-time Gold Glove-winning outfielder, has hung up his cleats for a clipboard to join the Toronto Blue Jays coaching staff.

Ciara Says Russell Wilson Adores Her Body Even More After Welcoming Their Fourth Child



Motherhood has always been a transformative journey for Ciara , and with the birth of her fourth child, Amora, in December 2023, the singer found herself in yet another phase of self-discovery. Despite being no stranger to bouncing back after pregnancy, the 39-year-old entertainer admitted that this time, her body responded differently. However, rather than being overly critical, she is choosing to embrace the changes, especially with the unwavering support of her husband, NFL star Russell Wilson .In an interview with Bustle for The Little Things issue, Ciara opened up about the rapid transition she underwent as she prepared to return to the stage just months after giving birth. Joining Missy Elliott on tour so soon after welcoming her daughter was a challenge she described as feeling “a little out-of-body.” Although this wasn’t her first time navigating the demands of performing post-pregnancy, she acknowledged that age has introduced new factors into her recovery process. “It's not the first time I've had to do this. I've been there before, but your body changes as you get older. I'm trying to embrace every step,"" she shared.Unlike previous experiences, where she would have been tough on herself for not regaining her pre-baby physique quickly, Ciara is now approaching the journey with a renewed perspective.“I would've probably been so hard on myself because I hadn't made it back to where I was, post-baby,” she reflected. Instead of self-criticism, she has found appreciation for this version of herself, lovingly acknowledging the subtle changes brought about by her latest pregnancy. “I also was kind of loving this fourth-baby version of me,” she said. With Wilson by her side, her confidence has only grown, as he reassures her that the changes are something to be embraced. ""My baby definitely put a little bit more on my hips and there is, as Russell says, 'more to grab on.’”Even as she focuses on getting stronger, Ciara revealed that Wilson keeps her in check when she contemplates an intense fitness regimen. “I want to lean up a little bit more, tone up more, and he's like, 'Don't get crazy,'” she joked, highlighting how her husband encourages her to love herself in every stage of life.Beyond fitness and body positivity, family planning is another topic that frequently comes up for the couple. During a recent interview, when Jenna Bush Hager asked about the possibility of baby number five, Ciara coyly responded, “I do. I do!” While she expressed excitement about expanding their family, she also hinted at needing some time before another addition. “My youngest is one, so listen, there’s a trend with all of our babies –– they’re all three years apart.” Though she clarified that following this pattern wasn’t a strict requirement, she made it clear that she wasn't in a rush.However, Wilson seems more than ready for another baby. “If it’s up to Russ, ‘cinco’ is coming next month, but we got a little time, baby,” she quipped, playfully referring to their potential fifth child as “baby cinco.”Also Read: ""I never lost hope, I never lost faith"": Feeling ‘Disrespected’ by Giants, Saquon Barkley turned doubt into dominance this season She also shared that it’s all about the effort to keep the “spark” and attraction alive. “You need to still turn up the sexy,"" Ciara, 39, told the outlet. ""He walks through the door, and I’m like, ‘OK!’ Because he intentionally went in to go get sexier, to get cute. For me, the same thing.""With a home filled with love, laughter, and support, Ciara continues to thrive in both her personal and professional life. And with Wilson as her biggest cheerleader, she proves that embracing change can be a beautiful thing.","Ciara gave birth to her fourth child, Amora, in December 2023.

After a disastrous Week 8 performance against the Texans—10-of-32 passing, 175 yards, five sacks—Richardson tapped out for a play in the third quarter, admitting he needed a breather.

The Vegas Golden Knights are facing a setback as star defenseman Shea Theodore has been ruled week-to-week with an upper-body injury sustained while representing Team Canada at the 4 Nations Face-Off. The injury occurred during Canada’s 4-3 overtime win against Sweden on Wednesday.Team Canada’s head coach, Jon Cooper, confirmed that Theodore will miss the remainder of the tournament, which wraps up next Thursday. Cooper, however, kept the specifics of the injury under wraps.Cooper said emotionally.Theodore suffered an apparent injury to his right wrist or forearm after a collision with Sweden’s Adrian Kempe in the second period. The hit sent Theodore hard into the glass. He was seen in visible pain on the bench before heading down the tunnel for X-rays.Kempe seemed unaware of the severity of the hit, statingTheodore, 29, has been a key player for the Golden Knights this season, racking up:With his seven-year contract extension set to begin next season at a $7.43 million cap hit, Theodore remains a vital piece of the Golden Knights' defense.In Theodore’s absence, Philadelphia Flyers defenseman Travis Sanheim will step into the lineup.

According to TSN’s Chris Johnston, Canada cannot add any new players unless another defenseman is injured. They can only notify a player to be on standby.With Theodore out, all eyes are on Sanheim to help Canada maintain its momentum as the tournament heads toward the final.

'India are always there near the end,' says Tim Southee on Champions Trophy chances

INDIA

JASPRIT BUMRAH : India’s pace spearhead, one of the world’s top fast bowlers, will miss the tournament due to a lower back injury sustained during the recent Border-Gavaskar Trophy. The Indian cricket board ( BCCI ) confirmed his unavailability on Feb 12, just days before the tournament begins. Harshit Rana has been called up as his replacement, but filling Bumrah’s shoes will be no easy task.

ENGLAND

JACOB BETHELL: England’s young batting allrounder Jacob Bethell has been ruled out due to a hamstring injury sustained during an ODI against India in Nagpur. His exclusion means that England will miss out on his dynamic batting capabilities and left-arm spin on pitches known to favour the slow bowlers. Tom Banton has been brought into the squad as his replacement.

SOUTH AFRICA

ANRICH NORTJE: South Africa’s fastbowling arsenal has taken a hit with the absence of quick bowler Anrich Nortje, who is known to bowl at speeds over the 150-kmph mark. Nortje’s back injury has troubled him since Sept 2023, and resurfaced just before the start of the SA20, South Africa’s domestic franchise-based T20 league.

GERALD COETZEE: Coetzee, who impressed one and all during the 2023 ODI World Cup in India, will also miss the tournament. The 24-year-old is nursing a groin injury, which ruled him out of the ongoing ODI tri-series in Pakistan.

AUSTRALIA

PAT CUMMINS: Australia’s campaign will be notably affected by the absence of their entire first-choice pace attack. The most crucial name missing is their regular captain, Pat Cummins. Cummins suffered an ankle injury during the Border-Gavaskar Trophy and has missed Australia’s entire tour of Sri Lanka.

Allrounder Mitchell Marsh has been ruled out due to ongoing lower back pain. Despite undergoing rehabilitation, his condition did not improve sufficiently, leading to the decision to rest him for an extended period of time. MARCUS STOINIS: The Australian allrounder unexpectedly retired from One-Day Internationals just days ago. At 35, Stoinis decided to step away from the 50-over format to focus exclusively on T20 Internationals, thereby making himself unavailable for the Champions Trophy.

PAKISTAN

SAIM AYUB: Promising young opener Saim Ayub has been ruled out due to a right ankle fracture sustained during the second Test against South Africa in Cape Town earlier this year. The injury occurred while fielding as Ayub twisted his ankle chasing a ball, leading to him being stretchered off the field. Following medical assessment, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) announced that Ayub would be sidelined for approximately 10 weeks. He is currently undergoing rehabilitation in England.

AFGHANISTAN

MUJEEB UR RAHMAN: An integral part of the Afghanistan team, Mujeeb was ruled out after he sustained a sprain in the index finger of his bowling hand. He had suffered an injury on the same hand previously too. Mujeeb’s nonselection was a precautionary measure to ensure his complete recovery before returning to the international scene.

ALLAH GHAZANFAR: Afghanistan’s 18-year-old spin sensation Allah Ghazanfar will miss the Champions Trophy due to a fracture in his L4 vertebra, an injury sustained during a tour to Zimbabwe in Dec last year. He has been a pivotal player of late.

Even before a ball has been bowled in the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy , the absence of some major cricketers seems to have robbed the tournament of some sheen and hampered the prospects of their respective teams. Among them are some big stars too who will be watching from the sidelines. Injuries, personal reasons and even a shock retirement have colluded to rob fans of some of the game’s sought-after names, leaving teams scrambling to cobble together a squad.The absence of these players changes the dynamics of the tournament significantly. While some teams have found capable replacements, others will struggle to compensate for the experience and skill these players bring. As the tournament unfolds, the impact of these missing stars will be closely watched, and their teams will hope that the chosen replacements can step up on the big stage.","The upcoming ICC event will see quite a few big names missing in action, leaving their teams depleted & fans disappointed.

Howie Roseman Takes a Hit but Leads Eagles' Super Bowl Parade with Pride



Philadelphia Eagles fans are known for their unrelenting passion, and they proved it once again as they flooded the streets of the city to celebrate their team’s dominant Super Bowl LIX victory. The championship parade, an event filled with energy and jubilation, took an unexpected turn when Eagles general manager Howie Roseman was struck by a flying beer can, leaving him with a visible wound on his forehead. Despite the minor injury, Roseman remained unfazed, continuing to march alongside team owner Jeffrey Lurie in front of a roaring crowd.As images of Roseman’s injury circulated on social media, fans were both amused and concerned about the incident. NBC Sports Philadelphia confirmed that the can hit Roseman, causing a small gash, but the resilient executive took it in stride. Eagles pass rusher Josh Sweat, who was instrumental in the defensive effort that shut down Patrick Mahomes, couldn’t help but laugh at the mishap.“I laughed at him a little bit when it happened,” Sweat admitted. “And I know he's mad at me. ... When I saw it, I knew what happened, and I couldn't contain my laugh. ... I did not throw the can at him. But hey, that’s part of it! They’re throwing full cans and bottles.”The incident, however, did not deter Roseman from celebrating in style. With a cut on his forehead and a cigar in hand, the veteran executive continued his triumphant march through the streets of Philadelphia, proving that nothing— not even a flying beer can—could dampen his championship spirit.Roseman’s journey with the Eagles has been nothing short of remarkable. Having started with the organization in 2000 as a front office intern, he worked his way up to become general manager and executive vice president. Over the past eight seasons, he has built two Super Bowl-winning teams, cementing his reputation as one of the NFL’s most astute executives.As the mastermind behind a franchise that has appeared in three Super Bowls and won two in just eight years, Roseman addressed the sea of Eagles fans gathered in front of the Philadelphia Museum of Art with a fiery proclamation.“I bleed for this city! Go Eagles!” he declared, still sporting the fresh wound. “Our players, our staff did an unbelievable job. We are two-time world champs, and we’re coming back strong!”His leadership was on full display this season, especially in the way he reconstructed a struggling defense. After the Eagles finished 26th in total defense and 30th in scoring defense in 2023, Roseman took bold action, selecting standout cornerbacks Quinyon Mitchell and Cooper DeJean in the draft while securing linebacker Zack Baun in free agency. The revamped defense was a major factor in Philadelphia’s 40-22 dismantling of the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl LIX, where Mahomes was sacked six times and intercepted twice, preventing the Chiefs from making NFL history with a three-peat.As the confetti settles, Roseman’s work is far from over. The Eagles face a crucial offseason, with key players such as Baun, Josh Sweat, Milton Williams, and Mekhi Becton set to hit free agency. However, with Roseman at the helm, the franchise remains well-positioned to compete at the highest level for years to come.Also Read: Eagles fans belt out ‘We Are the Champions’ as Philadelphia goes green on Valentine’s Day to celebrate Super Bowl victory While the beer can incident added an unexpected twist to the celebrations, it also served as a fitting symbol of Roseman’s relentless dedication to Philadelphia. He may have left the parade with a scar, but it’s a mark of the battles he’s fought—and won—for this city. As Eagles fans continue to bask in the glory of another championship, one thing is certain: their team, led by Roseman, is far from finished.","Eagles general manager Howie Roseman was struck by a flying beer can during the team's Super Bowl LIX parade.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

'We don't look at averages and stats': Gautam Gambhir on sending Axar Patel at No. 5

How Mohammed Shami’s horoscope foretells India's success in Champions Trophy

Former England cricketer Kevin Pietersen has taken aim at a 'leading' UK journalist for defending England's lack of practice during their tour of India. Pietersen, who has been vocal about England’s struggles, lashed out on social media after the journalist cited injuries and a tight schedule as reasons for the team's training omissions.""Just got sent an article where a leading UK journo has said that Shastri & I got it wrong last night when discussing England not training. Reason - injuries and quick turnaround between games…!"" Pietersen posted on X.""Do me a f*****g favour! Stop writing about cricket if you’re going to write such rubbish. Injuries are part of sport and this schedule is like every bilateral series almost ever played. Injuries are NOT stopping batters from batting against net bowlers and learning the art of playing spin. And that’s where they should have been to IMPROVE! Trust me on this one as it saved my career against spin!"" Pietersen wrote.He further suggested that the journalist was trying to mislead fans, writing, ""It seems the journos are in cahoots with what we’re trying to be brainwashed into believing! You won’t fool the fan with such!""Also See: 2025 Champions Trophy Pietersen had already expressed his frustration over England’s lack of preparation in India, calling it ""gobsmacking"" that the team did not hold a single practice session after losing the first ODI and the T20I series.England endured a disastrous tour, losing the T20I series 4-1 before being swept 3-0 in the ODIs. Reports suggested that England avoided net sessions due to mounting injuries and a demanding schedule, but Pietersen dismissed these justifications, emphasising the importance of preparation, particularly in the subcontinent.""There isn't a single sportsman on this planet who can honestly say they’d improve without practicing whilst they’re getting beaten,"" he posted. ""There also cannot be one player in that England side that can sit on the plane leaving India and say to themselves, they did everything they could to help England win. And for that, I’m actually incredibly sad this evening. Losing is fine if you're giving your best to improve every day, and if England didn't train during this series then they didn’t try.""During commentary for the third ODI, Pietersen highlighted how England’s approach was reflected in their activities off the field. He noted that Tom Banton , who replaced the injured Jacob Bethell, was seen playing golf a day before the match instead of practicing.""I never played golf when I played cricket. I was in the nets hitting thousands of balls, trying to make improvements here in the sub-continent. Have your days off in England.""England captain Jos Buttler, however, defended the team’s preparation, stating, ""I'm not sure that's quite true, to be honest. We had a reasonably long tour, a few long travel days. There's been a couple of times we've not trained, but we've certainly done plenty of training throughout the tour.""""We obviously try and create a really good environment, but don’t mistake that for a lazy environment or a lack of effort. The guys are desperate to perform and do well and improve,"" Buttler added.Former India coach Ravi Shastri , who was also critical of England’s lack of training, remarked, ""From what I’ve heard, England have had just one net session this entire trip, if not any. If you're not prepared to do the hard yards, you're not going to improve.""With England’s struggles against spin exposed throughout the tour, concerns are mounting ahead of the upcoming ICC Champions Trophy in Pakistan and the UAE.
