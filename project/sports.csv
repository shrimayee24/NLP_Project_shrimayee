WATCH:

NEW DELHI: The ongoing three-match ODI series between India and Sri Lanka has faced controversy following a Decision Review System (DRS) incident during the second ODI on Sunday. Sri Lanka secured a 32-run victory, taking a 1-0 lead after the first match ended in a tie. The issue arose from a contentious DRS call involving Virat Kohli .Sri Lankan spinner Jeffrey Vandersay 's impressive performance, taking 6 for 33, was pivotal in bowling India out for 208 in 42.2 overs as they chased a target of 241.Despite Vandersay's efforts, attention shifted to a DRS decision that left the Sri Lankan team frustrated.In the 15th over of India's chase, Akila Dananjaya bowled an off-break that sharply spun in, beating Kohli's inside edge. Initially ruled lbw by the on-field umpire, Kohli opted for a review. The UltraEdge technology indicated a spike near the bat, leading TV umpire Joel Wilson to overturn the decision. Kohli's relief was evident as he smiled following the reversed call.The decision did not sit well with the Sri Lankan players. Kusal Mendis expressed his frustration by throwing his helmet to the ground, and Asalanka conveyed his displeasure to the on-field umpire, Raveendra Wimalasiri. Sri Lankan coach Sanath Jayasuriya also came down from the dressing room to discuss the decision with the reserve umpire.Despite the reprieve, Kohli's innings was short-lived. Four overs later, Vandersay bowled Kohli with a flipper that trapped him in front of the middle stump. Although Kohli considered another review, his partner Axar Patel dissuaded him, resulting in Kohli's departure.As Kohli approached the Sri Lankan unit for the customary post-match handshake, Jayasuriya stopped him for an intense but brief chat. The exchange ended amicably, with both men patting each other on the shoulder.India now face a do-or-die situation in the third ODI in Colombo on Wednesday, needing a win to level the series.",Sri Lanka beat India by 32 runs in second ODI in New Delhi.

India's Vinesh Phogat , who on Tuesday entered the final of the women's 50kg freestyle wrestling event at the Paris Olympics , was found overweight on the second day of the competition and has been disqualified from the Paris Olympics. As a result, she won't contest in the final today and will miss a historic podium finish.The statement by the Indian Olympic Associationi says: ""It is with regret that the Indian contingent shares news of the disqualification of Vinesh Phogat from the Women’s Wrestling 50kg class.Despite the best efforts by the team through the night, she weighed in a few grams over 50kg this morning.

The rules do not allow this and she has been disqualified,"" said an Indian coach.Cuban wrestler Yusneylis Guzman Lopez, who lost to Vinesh in the semifinal, will replace the disqualified Indian in the final against the American.""Vinesh failed second day weigh-in. According to the article 11 of the International Wrestling Rules, Vinesh (IND) will be replaced by the wrestler who lost against her in the Semifinal. Therefore Yusneylis Guzman Lopez (CUB) will compete in the Final,"" the Paris Games organising committee said in a statement.""Repechage Yui Susaki (Japan) vs Oksana Livach (Ukraine) will become bronze medal match,"" it added.As per a report in The Indian Express, Vinesh met the weight criteria for her bouts on Tuesday but the rules state that athletes should weigh within their weight category on both days of the event.The report also says that Vinesh was 2kg overweight on Tuesday night and worked out almost the entire night in hope of meeting the weight criteria on the day of her final. But that didn't materialise and requests by the Indian delegation to allow Vinesh some time to lose that extra 100 gm were not entertained.Vinesh will now end up last in the standings in the 50kg event at the Paris Games.She had famously defeated defending champion Yui Susaki of Japan in the pre-quarterfinals. Susaki had been unbeaten in her international career (82-0) before that match.However, Vinesh's is not the only case of disqualification beause of being overweight in the women's 50kg event at the Paris Games.On Tuesday, Italy's Emanuela Liuzzi was also forced to forfeit her preliminary bout after being found overweight.The intense overnight workout and drastic measures to reduce her weight led to Vinesh getting dehydrated, according to reports, and is receiving medical care in Paris.Reacting to the entire episode that struck India's campaign in Paris, PM Narendra Modi posted on X (formerly Twitter) to show his support for Vinesh.

Manu Bhaker: India's History-maker At Paris Olympics 2024

NEW DELHI: A disappointed and heartbroken Indian wrestler, Vinesh Phogat announced her retirement from wrestling on Thursday following her disqualification from the Paris Olympics. Vinesh shared an emotional message on social media.She was disqualified after being found 100 grams overweight during the weigh-in ahead of her gold medal match.“Maa, kushti mere se jeet gayi, main haar gayi.Maaf karna, aapka sapna, meri himmat sab toot chuke. Isse zyada taqat nahi rahi ab” (Mom, Wrestling has defeated me, I have lost. I lost…my courage is all broken, I don't have any more strength now),” Vinesh wrote on her social media account.""Alvida, kushti (Goodbye Wrestling 2001-2024),” she concluded.Vinesh made history by becoming the first Indian woman wrestler to reach the gold medal bout in her category on Tuesday. She was assured of at least a silver medal before the disqualification.Vinesh's disqualification from the final match against Sarah Ann Hildebrandt of the United States due to being 100gm overweight during the morning weigh-in was the most devastating setback of the day. The 29-year-old wrestler was utterly shattered by the turn of events.In response to her disqualification, Vinesh filed an appeal, requesting that she be awarded a joint silver medal. She was replaced in the final by Cuba's Yusneylis Guzman Lopez, whom Vinesh had defeated in the semifinals. Lopez ultimately lost to Hildebrandt in the championship match.As per international regulations, any wrestler found to be overweight during the weigh-in process will automatically be placed at the bottom of the final standings, regardless of their performance in the tournament.Indian Olympic Association (IOA) President PT Usha voiced her shock and disappointment over Vinesh Phogat 's disqualification.""After hearing the news that Vinesh Phogat is disqualified, I am shocked and disappointed. I had come here to meet Vinesh; she is physically and medically okay. Mentally, she is disappointed. Our support staff is with her, trying their best to help her reduce weight,"" PT Usha said.Previously, Dinshaw Pardiwala, Chief Medical Officer of the Indian Olympic contingent, disclosed that Phogat was 2.7 kg over the weight limit following her semi-final bout. He mentioned that efforts were made to help her reduce weight by restricting her food and water intake.Following her disqualification on Wednesday, Vinesh also appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).According to an IOA source, Vinesh requested the CAS to award her the silver medal.""Vinesh Phogat has appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) against her disqualification, asking for the silver medal. CAS will give its verdict tomorrow morning,"" the source had told ANI.Vinesh is a three-time Olympian and has won gold medals in both the Asian and Commonwealth Games.For the last 12 months, she has been at the forefront of intense demonstrations against the previous Wrestling Federation of India president Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, who faces allegations of sexual misconduct from female wrestlers.Vinesh, a consistent competitor in the 53kg weight class, had to make the difficult transition to 50kg just a few months prior to the Games, as Antim Panghal had already secured the Paris quota spot in that category.Panghal suffered a defeat in the first round and now confronts potential deportation after attempting to grant her sister Nisha access to the Games Village using her own accreditation card.",Vinesh Phogat announced her retirement from wrestling on Thursday following her disqualification from the Paris Olympics.

WHO IS SARAH ANN HLDEBRANDT

SARAH'S ROAD TO THE FINAL

SARAH'S WRESTLING RITUALS AND THE FLASH CARDS

NEW DELHI: It won't be wrong to analyse that Vinesh Phogat wrestled the final first before reaching the gold-medal match in the women's 50kg division at the Paris Olympics . Beating Yui Susaki, who had won nothing but gold in her 82-0 unbeaten international career until Tuesday, including the Tokyo Olympics gold, in the pre-quarterfinals was like a reverse draw for Vinesh.Both Vinesh and Susaki were in disbelief after the final whistle. Vinesh, thumping the mat and then laying flat with tears in her eyes, was perhaps amazed how the almighty scripted her story -- from the career-threatening injury at Rio 2016, from the protest on the streets to a clear path to the podium, from getting dragged on the road to taking down the unbeaten, from rehab room post surgery just a year ago to sparring sessions, from one weight category to another.Tough life, but she wrestled on.The first reaction on Susaki's face after the defeat was like she didn't know what it means when the referee raises the opponent's hand. She had never experienced that at the end of an international match she fought in her career before facing Vinesh in Paris.But that was that. A 3-2 win. Vinesh Phogat progressed, then beat Ukraine's former European champion Oksana Livach in the quarters and Pan American Games champion Yusneylis Lopez Guzman of Cuba in the semis to become the first Indian female wrestler to reach an Olympic final.Medal confirmed, but more than that, a chance to become the first Indian woman to win an individual Olympic gold medal now just six minutes away.A consolation for Susaki as well. Vinesh reaching the final made the Japanese alive for repechage and bronze.The only person in the world who can now stop Vinesh from becoming an Olympic gold medallist is Sarah Hildebrandt -- her American opponent in the final, with an impressive record.The 30-year-old Sarah, a bronze medallist from Tokyo Games and four-times World Champoinships medallist, made her international debut in 2013 in the 55kg weight category and went on to win the first of her seven Pan American Championships gold as a 19-year-old -- after taking up the sport inspired by her two brothers who were also wrestlers.Sarah choosing to wrestle was against the wish of her parents, who eventully came to terms with her decision after insistence by her middle school that wrote to them about their daughter's skills in wrestling , according to information available on the Paris Olympics website.Such was her build-up that her mother would end up being her sparring partner during practice sessions.""When I started wrestling, my mum would come over to watch practices with just me and my coach and I would end up wrestling her. This sweet woman let me beat her up at 5:30 in the morning, for the sake of my improvement,"" Sarah, who is the reigning Pan American champion besides being the bronze medallist from the 2023 Budapest World Championships, is mentioned as saying on the Paris 2024 website.Over the years since arriving on the international mat 11 years ago, Sarah has switched from 55kg to 53kg, and then to her current weight division, 50kg.She began her Paris journey with an impressive 10-0 victory by technical superiority against Ibtissem Doudou of Algeria.Sarah followed that up with a 7-4 triumph over China's 2023 World Championships bronze medallist Feng Ziqi in the quarters.In the semis, she defeated the 2023 World Championships silver medallist Otgonjargal Dolgorjav of Mongolia with a comfortable 5-0 win.Before taking the mat in a match, Sarah's favourite music is the AC/DC band, with her walkout number being the super hit song 'Thunderstruck'.Sarah, who trains at the US Olympic and Paralympic Training Center in Colorado, has an interesting ritual when it comes to studying her opponents -- she makes flash cards.""I literally make flash cards on opponents like I'm in school, just kind of study them when I am in the sauna, and stuff like that,"" she told FloWrestling before arriving to Paris.""Just going over things like what their first tie is, which way do I want to circle, their moves that may be frequent, some no-no's at my end, like 'let's not even do that'...It just kind of keeps you fresh because I want my wrestling to be the main star when I step on the mat, the main thing I am focused on.""Obviously I am going to come prepared. There are things specifically that I am going to do and not going to do against people. So just have an idea like let's circle right after the whistle, or they are gonna do this after the whistle...just having those ideas in the back of your mind,"" she added.""When stuff starts rolling, it just comes naturally.""On Wednesday, it won't be the biggest match of the career for only Vinesh. Sarah, too, will be competing to win her first ever Olympic gold.It's going to be a contest.","Vinesh Phogat is the first Indian female wrestler to reach an Olympic final. She beat Yui Susaki, who had won nothing but gold in her 82-0 international career. Vinesh will now face American Sarah Hildebrandt in the women's 50kg final.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112334741,imgsize-64160,width-400,resizemode-4/112334741.jpg"

It is a hub of convention centres, a part of the Paris Expo. Found myself inside Hall 6 after a frantic walk through a sea of bodies. This looked like the busiest venue at the Paris Games.Saikhom Mirabai Chanu had just walked on the stage during the introduction to loud applause; she was No. 10 on the competition list in a field of 12.But that number did not matter. The Indian lifter who won a silver at Tokyo Games was in medal contention. She always is. Sadly, she finished fourth, just 1kg behind her Thai rival who took bronze.In the snatch, which has pulled her down sometimes, becoming the difference between gold and silver, Mirabai finally ended the jinx of 85kg. She lifted 85kg in her first try. She looked comfortable. But she missed when the bar was raised to 88kg on her second try.She returned determined. On her third try, she snatched the barbell well, sat on her haunches for a while and got up for a ‘good lift’. Who knows, if she had managed 88kg in the second, she could have gone for 89 or 90kg.Mirabai finished third in snatch. Tied with her was Thailand’s Surodchana Khambao . They were behind Valentin Cambei of Romania (93) and Hou Zhihui of China who lifted 93kg. The gap with the leader was 5kg. The real battle had begun. The fight for the medals was between these four ladies.Clean and jerk is where Mirabai shows her true mettle. Her first try began at 111kg.

IYO SKY uses Damage CTRL to gain a win over Sonya Deville: Raw highlights, Aug. 5, 2024

""It's been very, very interesting. Some comments were like, 'Okay, sure.' But there's other ones were like, I'll say, 'The female Shield.' Yeah, we will take that. We are very happy to be the female Shield. Yes,"" [H/T: Fightful]""

Damage CTRL return to engage Sonya Deville, Shayna Baszler & Zoey Stark: Raw, July 29, 2024

When discussing the greatest factions of all time, The Shield's name always comes to mind. Although the team has now split, it appears WWE is planning to form another faction similar to The Shield. A popular WWE Superstar recently shared her candid thoughts on her faction being compared to the legendary Shield, comprised of Roman Reigns , Dean Ambrose (now Jon Moxley in AEW ), and Seth Rollins.During an interview with Denise Salcedo at San Diego Comic-Con, Stark couldn't hide her excitement about working with Baszler and Deville on television. When asked about fans dubbing their group the ""female version of The Shield,"" Stark confidently stated,One could tell, from the excitement in her voice, just how proud she and the others in her faction are with the comparison—one that carries The Shield's legacy, but also carves out her own identity within WWE. A testimony to the fans that this group is ready to dominate and leave its stamp on WWE history.In the high-stakes world of WWE, alliances and rivalries can make or break a superstar's career. Last week, the latest powerhouse faction on WWE RAW demonstrated their ruthless efficiency and teamwork in a match that had fans on the edge of their seats. The showdown took place between Sonya Deville and Lyra Valkyria, two formidable athletes known for their intense ring presence. As the match progressed, it became clear that Valkyria was dominating, skillfully controlling the bout and inching closer to victory.However, the tides turned dramatically when Zoey Stark, Deville’s faction mate, made a surprise appearance at ringside. In a decisive moment, Stark interfered by shoving Valkyria off the top turnbuckle, causing her to crash to the mat. The interference was perfectly timed and executed, showcasing the seamless coordination within the new faction.Seizing the unexpected opportunity, Deville swiftly capitalized on Valkyria’s disorientation. With a quick pin, she clinched the victory, much to the dismay of Valkyria and her supporters. The match's outcome not only highlighted Deville's prowess but also underscored the strategic advantage of having loyal and cunning allies.","Zoey Stark, Shayna Baszler, and Sonya Deville have teamed up to form a powerful new faction on WWE RAW.

What are the rules for weight cut in wrestling at the Olympic Games?

Are rules different in UWW events and Olympics?

If 50kg is not Vinesh’s original weight category, then why was she competing in it?

Why wasn’t Vinesh awarded the silver medal if she won her bouts on Tuesday fair and square?

What happens to Vinesh’s medal?

What were the coach, physio and trainers with Vinesh doing? Isn't it a failure on their part too?

Vinesh was disqualified from the Games after failing the weigh-in for her 50kg final bout on Wednesday morning. She was about 100gms over the permissible limit of 50kg when she appeared for her weigh-in at 8 in the morning. After her semifinals on Tuesday night, Vinesh’s weight was 52.7kg. She made it to 50.1kg in the morning but couldn’t cut the last 100gms leading to her disqualification.According to United World Wrestling ’s (UWW) Chapter 3 of ‘Competition Procedure’, there is Article 11 about weigh-in which reads: “If an athlete does not attend or fails the weigh-in, he/she will be eliminated from the competition and ranked last.”Weigh-ins for each weight class take place in the morning of the competition round. The wrestling competitions for any particular weight category are contested over a two-day period. Any wrestler making the finals or the repechage round will have to give weight on both days. During the weigh-in, the wrestler has to match the required weight of his/her division wearing just the singlets.Yes. The United World Wrestling (UWW), the sport’s global governing body, brought in changes to its competition rules in late 2017 which were later introduced at the World Championships in 2018. It included shifting to a two-day format from single day events and introducing the concept of weigh-ins on both days. At the Olympics, the 2016 Rio Games was the last time the old rules were followed. The rule tweak also called for a 2kg weight allowance in each category. However, the 2kg weight allowance is only allowed in UWW-sanctioned World Championships, World Cups and other international events hosted by the global body. In the Olympics, no such allowance is permitted.Vinesh had previously competed in the women’s 53kg category but switched to 50kg after Antim Panghal earned an Olympic quota place in the 53kg class with a bronze medal at the World Championships in Belgrade last year. Vinesh didn’t compete at the Belgrade Worlds as she was sitting on a dharna protesting against former Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh. During the selection trials held in Delhi for the Asian Olympics Qualifiers in Bishkek, Vinesh competed in the 50kg category. She won the trials and secured her Paris quota at the Asian qualifiers. Later, the WFI announced that there will be no selection trials for all six Olympic quota-winning wrestlers and all of them will represent the country in Paris. The decision meant that Vinesh would compete in 50kg only. If trials had happened, she would have had the chance to challenge Antim for a spot in the 53kg division.According to UWW’s competition rules, if a wrestler fails the weigh-in before his/her scheduled bout either on the first day or the second day, he/she is immediately disqualified and given the last spot. It meant Vinesh wasn’t eligible for any medal despite reaching the final of the event. She would have won silver even if she had lost the final or withdrawn from the final due injury or illness.Cuban wrestler Yusneylis Lopez, who lost to Vinesh in the semifinals, will play the gold medal match against United States’s Sarah Ann Hildebrandt. Japanese wrestler Yui Susaki will play for bronze against Oksana Livach of Ukraine.According to sources, her team of support staff put in their best efforts through the night to cut her weight. It included jogging, running, sitting in the sauna, wearing a thick warm jacket for excessive sweating and maintaining water level to avoid excessive retention. Dr Dinshaw Pardiwala, the chief medical officer of the Indian contingent, confirmed that drastic measures were taken to reduce Vinesh's weight including chopping off her hair on Wednesday morning. Vinesh’s weight, on non-competition days, ranges between 56-57kg and that’s why it was extremely challenging to cut it to 50kg. Her coach, physio and dietician did everything possible to bring her weight down. However, should they have allowed Vinesh’s weight to fluctuate so much?","Vinesh Phogat was about 100gms over the permissible limit of 50kg when she appeared for her weigh-in at 8 in the morning.

You are not only the daughter of India but also its pride),"" he further wrote.Vinesh, who made history by becoming the first Indian woman wrestler to reach the gold medal bout in her category on Tuesday, was assured of at least a silver medal before her disqualification. She announced her retirement on Thursday morning, posting an emotional message on social media.""Ma, wrestling has won, I have lost.

Vinesh Phogat's disqualification from Paris Olympics: An athlete's challenges in managing the self,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/paris-olympics-2024/indiaparis/vinesh-phogats-disqualification-from-paris-olympics-an-athletes-challenges-in-managing-the-self/articleshow/112361702.cms,"Abhi nahin, sir, please jaane do. Abhi mujhe weight manage karna hain.

PARIS: ""I will speak tomorrow."" A hope filled, happy-sounding Vinesh Phogat was bounding off after reaching the final of the women's 50kg freestyle on Tuesday here in Paris, before she was found just about 100g over in the morning weigh-in for the final.Even in the euphoria of victory, the 29-year-old wrestler was clearly more concerned about maintaining her weight ahead of the morning's final weigh-in.Later, as dusk was gathering over the Champs de Mars arena, Vinesh was seen skipping near the athletes' area. In a full 45-minute session, she did some running and stretching, all wearing layers of clothing to help the excessive sweating continue. Then, as she cooled down, she spent nearly quarter of an hour with herself, sometimes looking ahead - the Eiffel in the distance - or with her head buried in her hands. It was a reflective period for the wrestler, but it was clear more pressing things were on her mind.Despite all the conspiracy theories swirling over Vinesh's unfortunate exit hours before what was a historic final, the struggle to manage weight in competition is a real challenge for wrestlers , boxers and weightlifters, sometimes more than the draw itself.At the 1984 LA Olympics, India's lifter Kamalakanta Santra was found to be two kg over at the 60kg weigh-in. If memory serves one right, Santra essentially sought to beef himself up by eating. His coach later said that in his zeal, Santra had overeaten.Cutting weight is a standard practice that all wrestlers carry out, since they usually go into the tournament at least three kg above if not more, but there also comes a time when the body simply refuses to give in. That is what perhaps also may have happened with Vinesh on the final morning. On whether Vinesh needed to eat to replenish her depleted resources can be gauged by her empty reserves in the second period of her quarterfinal bout when Ukriane'sOksana Livach came strongly at her and the Indian had nothing physical to hold her off with. She resorted instead on experience and guile - and a breather via a challenge - to win.Often, it is those in the lower weight categories who face the bigger problems, further complicated in case of women for whom shedding weight is physiologically not as easy as in men. There is a natural tendency to gain weight and it is higher in the lower categories than in the higher ones.""In weight categories that are crucial, we monitor the weight loss at sleep time and in the morning, and discover that in the lower weights, there is often a weight loss of 300 to 500g compared to nearly 800g in the higher categories,"" explained Mohit Dhariwal, SAI-appointed boxing team nutritionist during the pre-Games training at Saarbrucken, Germany. ""Weights in the lower categories are the toughest to shed.""He pointed to the case of boxer Nikhat Zareen, who despite being disciplined with dietary requirements, faces great difficulties in managing weight. Indeed, there were whispers of Nikhat's struggles in Saarbrucken against weight. When asked how much she was over, the boxer often missing from the campus cafeteria since she was placed on a leaner diet, replied, ""Three kgs.""In Paris too, Nikhat faced a similar weight management situation in leading up to both her bouts - against German Maxi Kloetzer and later, China's Wu Yu . The 50kg boxer told TOI how she had been subsisting solely on water for the past two days. Her throat parched, Nikhat said that the water-only diet had led to sleepless nights before the bouts.Asked what she would eat after her win over Kloetzer, Nikhat said: ""Maybe some little protein, but not much, I have to manage weight.""Both Vinesh and Nikhat have had to relinquish their favoured weight classes to adjust to lower ones due to either the entry of a superior rival (Antim Panghal, 53 kg) or the official re-jigging of the weight categories. Nikhat had to leave her 54 kg and go down to 50. These adjustments come with a host of problems.Any boxer or wrestler often weighs at least a couple of kgs if not more than their weight category, making it tortuous to shed weight at such alarming rates and in such short span of time. Vinesh, at 29, has a natural weight easily above 55 kg, plus a possibility of hormonal and retention issues coming into play.Particular care is taken in the replenishment and recovery.A visit to the National Institute of Sports, Patiala ahead of the Olympics revealed carefully drawn up charts for nutrition plastered on the boxing hall walls, giving us an idea of how much rigour goes into an athlete's weight management.","Vinesh Phogat was found to be just about 100g over in the morning weigh-in for the final.

These guys have been playing very well over the past few years; very consistent. You will lose the odd series,” Rohit said.""We lost the series and I feel there are a lot of areas we need to look at rather than the positives. We need to go back and look at what we need to do when we come up against conditions like this,” he added.Rohit, who recently led India to a T20 World Cup victory, dismissed suggestions of complacency during the series against Sri Lanka.""No, it's a joke. When you're playing for India, there's no complacency,"" Rohit said.The Indian team captain admitted that their performance throughout the series was not up to the mark.""We didn't play good cricket through the series and that is why we stand here. Throughout, there were a few positives too. How the spinners bowled, some of the batters in the middle as well,"" he said.According to Rohit, the toss was a critical factor in the ODI series. Sri Lanka first managed to tie the opener after then restricted India in the second game to win it by 32 runs.""We have to give credit where credit is due. Sri Lanka played better than us. We looked at the conditions and wanted to take pace off the ball, and that's why we went with our combination,” Rohit said.Sri Lanka captain Charith Asalanka admitted he was ‘happy' after leading his under-fire side to a series win over India.""I'm a happy captain right now and I think the team did all the things well throughout the series. We all knew they were a very strong batting line-up and we just wanted to back our strength, which is spin bowling,"" he said.""We are in a really good mood right now, especially our coach (Sanath Jayasuriya).

The result also highlighted the challenges faced by the Indian team on turning tracks, as acknowledged by Maheesh Theekshana in his post-match comments.""We knew they are used to small grounds and good wickets in India.

Virat Kohli , Shreyas Iyer , Shubman Gill and KL Rahul had fairly long batting sessions. Neither Mohammed Siraj nor Arshdeep Singh bowled.Ryan ten Doeschate adds, ""We're trying to be very specific and learn from the mistakes in the first couple of games since the conditions have been very tough, guys have come up with their own plans and how they want to go about it. It's more of a mental point of view, they're all fantastic players of spin, that's not likely to be an issue. We're trying to just form an environment where the guys feel positive where they can really express themselves and go out to show how good they are. I think it's admirable how the guys one-up with themselves under pressure. They feel that we'll at least share the series with Sri Lanka. And the preparation has been made around that we can be our best.""With the second match ending in a loss, India now has the choice of fielding their strongest XI or experimenting ahead of the next major ICC tournament, which takes place in just six months.Abhishek Nayar concludes, ""I think as Indians we are emotional people and normally when sometimes you don't get results our way, there is a lot of passion and integrity at stake for every individual so every cricketer in that dressing room knows what's at stake and a lot of time that sort of brings the best out of the team and it bring out that fighting spirit that you want to often see in our team, then you obviously try to implement that in the centre with all the strategies that you come with, all the discussions that we have in the dressing room, sometimes, being pushed against the wall brings the best out of us.""A loss would come as a shock to the recently recruited Gautam Gambhir-led coaching staff, who took over a team that had played some of the best ODI cricket in India less than a year ago.

Rohit Sharma, the Indian skipper, has been in excellent form throughout the series, looking comfortable at the crease while other Indian batters have struggled. His current form and momentum make him one of the safest picks for fantasy contests.

On the other hand, Kuldeep Yadav, the Indian left-arm wrist-spinner, has not been at his best in the series. However, given the nature of the wicket, he has the potential to emerge as one of the highest point earners in this game.

For Sri Lanka, young all-rounder Dunith Wellalage has been impressive with both bat and ball in the series. His current rhythm in both departments makes him one of the top picks for the game.

Additionally, Jeffrey Vandersay, the Sri Lankan skipper, had a remarkable performance in the last ODI, dismissing six Indian batters. With his current form, he can be a valuable asset in fantasy contests.

NEW DELHI: The Indian batsmen, especially Virat Kohli , will need to strategically handle the spin challenge in the third and final ODI on Wednesday to prevent their first series loss to Sri Lanka in 27 years.This is not the ideal start for Gautam Gambhir in his debut ODI assignment as the team's head coach.India's last bilateral ODI series defeat against Sri Lanka was in 1997 when Arjuna Ranatunga's team inflicted a 0-3 defeat on Sachin Tendulkar's side.Since then, India has won all 11 bilateral ODI series against Sri Lanka, both at home and away.India cannot win the current series after losing the second ODI by 32 runs and tying the first match. The batsmen's indecisiveness on the spin-friendly RPSC pitch has put the team in this uncomfortable position.Kohli's struggles have been the most evident, scoring only 38 runs in two matches. More concerning than the number of runs is the manner of his dismissals, falling to the leg-spin of Wanindu Hasaranga and Jeffrey Vandersay. Kohli appeared subdued and failed to capitalise on the strong starts provided by Rohit Sharma .A confident and in-form Kohli is crucial for India's success in the middle overs, whether chasing or setting a target. However, his struggles reflect the overall difficulties faced by the Indian batting unit.Shivam Dube, the designated spin-hitter, failed to read a straightforward leg-break from Vandersay in the second ODI. Shreyas Iyer and KL Rahul, known for their prowess against spinners, have struggled with their footwork and wrist play against the Lankan slow bowlers.The Indian batsmen need to learn from Rohit's approach, particularly his confidence and planning, to effectively rotate the strike and keep the spinners at bay on the Premadasa pitches. Rohit's exceptional batting against both pace and spin has been a standout performance in the series.India (IND) and Sri Lanka (SL) are set to face off in the third and final ODI of their three-match series at the R. Premadasa Stadium in Colombo on August 7 at 2:30 PM IST.The two teams have a long history of playing against each other, with India holding the upper hand in their head-to-head record. Out of the 170 ODI matches played between the two sides, India has emerged victorious in 99 games, while Sri Lanka has managed to win 58 times.The pitch at the R. Premadasa Stadium has been a typical Sri Lankan wicket, offering slow and challenging conditions for the batters. The best time to score runs on this surface is when the ball is new and hard, as it comes onto the bat nicely. However, as the match progresses, the ball tends to slow down and starts to turn, making it difficult for the batters to score freely.Considering the pitch conditions, top-order batters from both teams have the best chance of scoring well and earning fantasy points. While the new ball bowlers might not get much assistance from the wicket, spinners from both sides could prove to be valuable assets in fantasy XIs.Rohit Sharma (C), Ꮪhubman Gill (VC), Virat Kohli, KL Rahul (WK), Rishabh Pant (WK), Shreyas Iyer, Shivam Dube, Kuldeep Yadav, Mohd.

3rd ODI: Will India stave off Sri Lanka to keep a nearly three-decade long record intact?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-in-sri-lanka/3rd-odi-will-india-stave-off-sri-lanka-to-keep-a-nearly-three-decade-long-record-intact/articleshow/112308862.cms,"The Indian batsmen will need to tactically navigate the spin challenge in the third and decisive ODI on Wednesday to prevent their first series loss to Sri Lanka in nearly three decades, 27 years to be precise. The path has been set by captain Rohit Sharma , and it is up to the rest of the batting lineup to follow the skipper.In his maiden ODI series as head coach, this is definitely not the start Gautam Gambhir would have envisioned, given his emphasis on winning.India were last defeated in a bilateral ODI series against the Lankans in 1997. India haven't lost for 11 series of 50-over internationals between the two teams since then.However, the visitors find themselves in an unfamiliar position, after a tie in the opening match and a 32-run defeat in the second. Winning the three-match series is now beyond India's grasp, and the team will be determined to avoid a defeat in the final match of the series at Colombo 's R Premadasa Stadium on Wednesday.This position of discomfort is brought upon the team largely by their batsmen, who seemed to have been plagued by indecisiveness on a pitch that offered plenty of turn to the spinners.Star batter Virat Kohli epitomized the team's fragility more than anyone else. Besides scoring only 38 runs in two matches, it's the nature of Kohli's dismissals that has raised concerns.Kohli has appeared subdued in the middle, after the explosive starts provided by Rohit in the two games. The master batter within Kohli remained dormant as he struggled against the leg-spin of Wanindu Hasaranga in the first match and Jeffrey Vandersay, who claimed six wickets, in the second, before eventually succumbing to them.Perhaps, Kohli should focus on the happier memories rather than allowing his mind to be shackled by the current challenges. India's success in the middle overs, whether chasing or setting a target, heavily relies on a free-flowing Kohli.Shivam Dube, India's designated spin-basher, failed to read a simple leg-break from Vandersay in the second one-dayer, resulting in an lbw dismissal. Shreyas Iyer and KL Rahul, known for their prowess against spinners, have struggled to use their feet and wrists effectively against the Lankan slow bowlers.The solution possibly lies in observing Rohit's batting, not necessarily his approach, but the confidence and strategy behind his innings.Rohit's mastery over the Lankan bowlers, both pace and spin, has been remarkable. His 44-ball 64 was a display of well-calculated strokes that never seemed risky.The team management may reconsider Dube's position in the lineup when deciding the eleven for the match on Wednesday.Given the conditions in Colombo and the nature of the pitch, batting allrounder Riyan Parag's spin bowling can prove more useful than Dube's straightforward medium pace.On their end, the Indian bowlers need to step up their performance in the crucial stages of the game as the previous matches highlight their failure to bowl the hosts out for a low score despite reducing them to 142 for 6 and 136 for 6.","India were last defeated in a bilateral ODI series against the Lankans in 1997.
