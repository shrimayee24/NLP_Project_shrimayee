Team India, under the leadership of Suryakumar Yadav , began their T20 World Cup 2026 campaign on a winning note, defeating the United States of America by 29 runs at the Wankhede Stadium on Saturday.The Men in Blue will next face Namibia on Thursday at the Arun Jaitley Stadium in Delhi. That will be followed by a marquee showdown against arch-rivals Pakistan on Sunday, February 15. The much-anticipated clash is set to take place at the R. Premadasa Stadium in Colombo and is expected to be one of the highlights of the group stage.India will wrap up their Group A fixtures with a match against the Netherlands on February 18 at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad.As defending champions, India enter the tournament with a chance to achieve something truly special. In a format where supremacy is often short-lived and margins razor-thin, the team has an opportunity to defend a men’s T20 World Cup title — an achievement that would further strengthen their legacy in the shortest format. India are also aiming to become the first nation to lift the T20 World Cup trophy on home soil.A successful campaign would also make India the first team to win the men’s T20 World Cup three times.India’s journey in the tournament began with glory in the inaugural edition in 2007, when they defeated Pakistan in the final at the New Wanderers Stadium in Johannesburg under the captaincy of Mahendra Singh Dhoni. That iconic triumph laid the foundation for India’s dominance in T20 cricket.The second title, however, came after a long wait. Seventeen years later, India returned to the summit in 2024, with Rohit Sharma leading the side to a memorable title win. India edged past South Africa in a thrilling final to finally end their prolonged title drought.Now, with momentum on their side, India will look to script another historic chapter in T20 World Cup history.","India begin their T20 World Cup 2026 campaign against USA on Saturday.

"Identical twins, identical scores (285) in JEE Main",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/identical-twins-identical-scores-285-in-jee-main/articleshow/128486729.cms,"The twins with their mother

At Kota academy, twins turned every test into a private contest

MUMBAI/JAIPUR: In a city crowded with toppers and tight schedules, brothers Mahroof Ahmed Khan and Masroor Ahmed Khan in Kota stand out for an almost uncanny symmetry. The twins, who share the same shoe size and eyeglass power, studied together, tested together, sat the same JEE Main (Session-I) 2026 shift, and walked away with identical marks till the last digit - 285 out of 300; an NTA score of 99.998.Under NTA rules, candidates must declare if they are twins while filling out forms for the same competitive exam. Such candidates are made to take the exam in the same shift to ensure the integrity of exams like JEE and NEET. Their story began in Bhubaneswar, Odisha, and moved, like so many other JEE journeys, to Kota in 2023.Known for cracking Olympiad exams, the twin brothers hoped the city's coaching ecosystem would sharpen them for bigger tests ahead, and turned friendly rivalry into a full-time study tool.""The twins came here sharing not just classrooms and notes, but an entire rhythm of preparation. Born on May 7, 2008, they have moved in parallel lines for as long as they can remember - same school, same coaching, same ambition,"" said Prof Amit Ahuja, career counsellor at Allen Career Institute. Behind this effort was a decision that reshaped the family's life.Their mother, Dr Zeenat Begum, a gynaecologist who had been working for Odisha govt since the 1990s, put her career on hold to move to Kota with her sons.For three years, she managed their routines, meals, health, and morale, becoming the quiet constant in a high-pressure environment.Zeenat said the move to Kota was initially meant to be temporary. ""Both of them got selected for the International Science Olympiad in 2023, and we came to Kota in March that year, thinking we would stay for a few months till they prepared for the Olympiad exam. But after a few weeks, both said that they liked the environment and the study approach here and decided to pursue coaching for JEE,"" she said. ""When they decided to pursue a career in engineering and prepare in Kota for JEE, I left my job as I thought that if their career was made, I too could restart mine. But supporting them is important in this phase,"" Zeenat said.At the academy, the twins found their competitive edge not in outpacing others, but in pushing each other. If one slipped, the other stepped in - dissecting mistakes, revising concepts, and resetting goals.At home, the competition stayed strictly in-house. Their mother said the twins competed only as a preparation strategy, calling each other their ""friend"" and ""mirror"". ""They would study and give exams together and compare their scores with each other and with their previous attempts. It helped them identify their weaknesses, and they worked to improve them. This mutual competition is their greatest strength,"" said Zeenat.","Mahroof Ahmed Khan and Masroor Ahmed Khan share the same shoe size and eyeglass power.

Hate speech PIL 'targets' BJP CMs: Supreme Court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hate-speech-pil-targets-bjp-cms-supreme-court/articleshow/128485381.cms,"Representational image

NEW DELHI: SC on Tuesday criticised 12 'eminent' persons who together filed a PIL ""targeting"" CMs of BJP-governed states for alleged hate speeches while making a plea for framing guidelines to restrain constitutional functionaries and bureaucrats from breaching fidelity to constitutional morality.Appearing for petitioners, senior advocate Kapil Sibal told a bench of Chief Justice Surya Kant and Justices BV Nagarathna and Joymalya Bagchi that the country's atmosphere had become toxic and ""it is only the SC which can and should remedy it.""However, the CJI-led bench was quick to point out that the petition had selectively named individuals while highlighting the problem. ""This petition is definitely targeting certain individuals as it leaves out others who routinely make such hate speeches. Let the petitioners not create an impression that it is targeting certain individuals.""The petitioners, including Roop Rekha Verma, Mohd Adeep, Harsh Mander, Najeeb Jung, John Dayal and Ashok Kumar Sharma had cited the alleged hate speeches of Himanta Biswa Sarma, Yogi Adityanath, Devendra Fadnavis, Pushkar Singh Dhami, Anantkumar Hegde and Giriraj Singh, all of whom belong to BJP, in addition to certain remarks by some bureaucrats.""Come with an impartial and neutral petition. The issue is important. Ultimately, there must be restraint in speech from all sides. We would like to say all political party functionaries must be mindful of constitutional morality and exercise restraint in their speeches, and any guideline should be applicable across the board,"" said the CJI.The bench said there are political parties which brazenly make speeches based on their communal ideology and openly profess hatred. ""You have not cited a single example from the other side.""When Sibal said he would delete all references to individuals in the petition, the bench responded that it would hear the PIL after the necessary amendments are carried out.Justice Nagarathna said, ""Political party leaders must foster fraternity. Courts can pass orders. But the remedy lies in political parties and democratic institutions living up to constitutional values and morality."" Justice Nagarathna added, ""The origin of speech is the thought process. Can by court order the thought process of a person be altered or restricted? What about free speech?""Justice Bagchi told Sibal, ""It is such a vague petition. Instead of it being a populist exercise, let it be a constructive constitutional exercise. Humdrum of politics should not dictate the filing of the PIL.""Sibal sought two weeks to amend the PIL.The two prayers of the petitioners read like fundamental duties of a citizen: a) declaration that public speeches of constitutional functionaries or holders of public office are subject to constitutional morality and should not violate fundamental rights of others; b) formulation of guidelines to govern public speech by constitutional functionaries and bureaucrats to ensure fidelity to constitutional morality, without imposing prior restraint or censorship.","12 'eminent' persons together filed a PIL ""targeting"" CMs of BJP-governed states for alleged hate speeches.

Congress In Damage Control Mode After Mani Shankar Aiyar’s Baton Remark To Kerala Chief Minister

Father, son and the 'Holy ghost'

NEW DELHI: Veteran leader Mani Shankar Aiyar on Tuesday fired a fresh salvo at Congress leadership with party's history to warn that the party has always thrived on internal dissent and suffered whenever it tried to suppress it.In a video released on his Youtube channel titled 'No space for dissent in today's Congress?' the leader said traced ideological conflicts, leadership rivalries and rebellions stretching back to the party's founding in 1885 to make the case that disagreement, not conformity, has been Congress's defining strength.""There was just one time when a complete ban was placed on any kind of dissidents.That was during Indira Gandhi 's Emergency,"" Aiyar said.According to him, the consequences of silencing dissent during that period were catastrophic. ""The Congress not only lost,"" he said, ""Indira Gandhi lost her Rae Bareli seat and Sanjay Gandhi lost his Amethi seat. That is what happens if you crush dissidents in the Congress party .""Aiyar argued that internal disagreement has existed within Congress almost from its inception and was never treated as an aberration. He cited the selection of Badruddin Tyabji as Congress president in 1888 and the backlash he faced from sections of the Muslim elite, describing it as one of the earliest recorded episodes of dissent within the party.He went on to recount ideological clashes between moderates and extremists in the early 20th century, particularly the split between Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Lala Lajpat Rai and Bipin Chandra Pal on one side and leaders like Gopal Krishna Gokhale and M.G. Ranade on the other, culminating in the Surat split of 1907.""The real strength of the Congress has been in the variety of opinion which the Congress has always accommodated,"" Aiyar said.He noted that despite sharp disagreements, figures like Tilak eventually became Congress president, while Mahatma Gandhi openly acknowledged Gokhale as his political guru, underlining the party's ability to absorb contradictions rather than eliminate them.Drawing pointed historical from 1929 when Subhas Chandra Bose sarcastically remarked that the Congress was being run by ""the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost"", Aiyar said: ""Nobody expelled Subhas Chandra Bose for what he had said.""He described how Bose later walked out of the Congress after fundamental disagreements with Mahatma Gandhi over non-violence, forming the Forward Bloc, but was never expelled. ""He walked out of the Congress. He was not expelled,"" Aiyar emphasised.Aiyar also recalled intense disagreements between Jawaharlal Nehru and his father Motilal Nehru, noting that ""it became impossible to have dinner in Anand Bhavan because the father and son were quarrelling so much among each other"".""That is how you deal with dissidents in the Congress party,"" Aiyar said.Aiyar argued that Indira Gandhi marked a decisive break from this tradition. While disagreements with the Congress ""Syndicate"" were initially accommodated, he said, her decision to split the party and later impose the Emergency represented a fatal intolerance of dissent.""She broke the party only because there were dissidents,"" Aiyar said, adding that the Emergency was ""the only way in which she could remain prime minister"".The verdict, he argued, came swiftly. ""The Congress not only lost,"" he repeated, ""Indira Gandhi lost her Raebareli seat and Sanjay Gandhi lost his Amethi seat.""He quoted two sentences Rajiv Gandhi uttered in the Lok Sabha on May 5, 1989:""Only a secular Bharat can survive,"" Rajiv Gandhi had said. ""And if India is not secular, then perhaps it does not deserve to survive.""Turning those words into a challenge, Aiyar said, ""I say to the Congress Party high command who have kept me out of the Working Committee, which now has 60 members, do you have the courage to repeat the words in the mouth of the son of Rajiv Gandhi?""Warning the current leadership, Aiyar said, ""If, therefore, the current establishment cannot stand a dissident, then I'm afraid it is the doom of the Congress.""""The Congress lives because of dissidents. The Congress grows because there are many opinions,"" he added.His final message was blunt: ""If we do not have the courage to answer the dissident in polite but firm language, then we do not deserve to rule.""The video comes amid row over his recent remarks on party leadership and praise for Kerala CM. The Congress has officially distaned itself from Aiyar saying he has no connection with the party.In a post on X, Khera said Aiyar ""has had no connection whatsoever with the Congress for the past few years. He speaks and writes purely in his personal capacity.""","Veteran leader Mani Shankar Aiyar says Congress has always thrived on internal dissent.

The Super 8 stage of the ICC T20 World Cup is nearly set, with seven teams confirming qualification and one final berth still to be decided.From Group A, India advanced in dominant fashion, winning all three of their matches.Group B saw Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe progress after Zimbabwe’s final league game against Ireland was washed out in Kandy. The shared points eliminated the 2021 champions Australia, who cannot catch Zimbabwe on the table.From Group C, England and West Indies qualified, while Group D representatives are New Zealand and South Africa.That leaves Pakistan in a must-win situation against Namibia. Victory will send Pakistan through and complete the Super 8 lineup. Any other result will confirm their elimination.However, there are further permutations. If Pakistan lose, United States national cricket team will qualify. The Netherlands national cricket team also remain mathematically in contention — but only if they defeat India by a massive margin. The challenge for the Netherlands is their net run rate of -1.352, compared to USA’s healthy +0.787, making qualification highly improbable unless there is a dramatic swing in results and NRR.The top two teams from each Super 8 group will advance to the semi-finals, setting up the final sprint towards the T20 World Cup 2026 title.","The Super 8 stage of the ICC T20 World Cup is nearly set, with seven teams confirming qualification and one final berth still to be decided.

Former India captain Sourav Ganguly has called for former Pakistan skipper Imran Khan to be treated with dignity and proper care, amid growing concern over the latter’s health in prison.Ganguly’s remarks follow a joint appeal by 14 former international captains from five Test-playing nations urging the Pakistan government to ensure improved prison conditions and appropriate medical attention for the World Cup-winning leader. “They have done the right thing. So, I'm sure Imran Khan must be looked after and respected,” Ganguly told reporters.The petition, initiated by former Australia captain Greg Chappell, was submitted to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, according to The Age. Among the signatories were India greats Sunil Gavaskar and Kapil Dev , along with Australia’s Allan Border, Steve Waugh , Ian Chappell, Belinda Clark, and Kim Hughes; England’s Mike Atherton, Nasser Hussain, Mike Brearley, and David Gower; West Indies legend Clive Lloyd; and New Zealand’s John Wright.In the letter, the former captains expressed “profound concern” over reports of Khan’s deteriorating health, particularly a significant decline in vision during his incarceration at Adiala prison in Rawalpindi, where he has been held for over two years on corruption charges. They stressed that someone of his stature deserves humane treatment, medical care from specialists of his choosing, regular family access, and fair legal proceedings without delay.The appeal underscored cricket’s long-standing role in fostering respect beyond rivalry, urging authorities to uphold principles of decency and justice. Gavaskar described the situation as “terrible,” noting their long-standing friendship that predates their on-field contests.Supporters claim Khan has lost 85 per cent vision in his right eye and faces limited access to family and personal doctors. He and his wife, Bushra Bibi, have been jailed since August 2023, and his recent convictions amount to a cumulative 31-year sentence.",Sourav Ganguly has called for former Pakistan skipper Imran Khan to be treated with dignity and proper care.

A long-discussed showdown between Ronda Rousey and Gina Carano is now official, with Netflix set to stream the bout live from the Intuit Dome in May. The announcement revived a rivalry fans have debated for more than a decade. It also renewed interest in how both pioneers of women’s MMA built their wealth through fighting, entertainment, and business ventures.Rousey and Carano helped bring female fighters into the mainstream. One dominated inside the UFC and later became a WWE champion. The other turned an eight-fight MMA career into a steady run in Hollywood. The boxer-turned-actresses made stunning fortunes over the years with their different careers. As the duo is set to get into the boxing ring coming out of retirement, here’s a breakdown of their net worth.Ronda Rousey’s net worth stands at $14 million in 2026 (per Celebrity Net Worth). Her rise began in judo, where she won Olympic bronze in 2008. She later became the first woman signed by the UFC and its inaugural Women’s Bantamweight Champion. Her early dominance drew massive pay-per-view buys and sponsorships.Rousey reportedly earned about $13 million for seven UFC fights between 2012 and 2016. Including her final bout against Amanda Nunes, her total UFC pay reached roughly $16 million. In 2015 alone, she earned $14 million from fight purses, bonuses, and endorsements.She transitioned to WWE in 2018, won the Raw Women’s Championship, and later added more titles. Her reported WWE salary reached $1.5 million per year, with added bonuses. Acting roles in films like Furious 7 and The Expendables 3 expanded her brand.

She compiled a 7-1 MMA record and became one of the first female stars in Strikeforce and EliteXC. Her 2009 bout with Cris Cyborg marked the first time a woman headlined a major MMA event.After retiring from MMA, Carano built her income through film and television. She starred in Haywire, Fast & Furious 6, and Deadpool. Her role as Cara Dune in The Mandalorian raised her profile further.Although her income in MMA was relatively small to that of Rousey in the UFC, Carano generated consistent income through acting, production, modeling, and TV shows.As for the net worth comparison, Rousey dominates in overall wealth due to her record-breaking fighting salary and high-profile endorsement deals.

Fact Check: Is Taylor Swift really buying the State of Rhode Island for her wedding with Travis Kelce,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/fact-check-is-taylor-swift-really-buying-the-state-of-rhode-island-for-her-wedding-with-travis-kelce/articleshow/128471950.cms,"(Instagram/Taylor Swift)

No, Taylor Swift is Not ""Buying Rhode Island""

The "" Ocean House "" Takeover: Reports have been circulating that Taylor and Travis Kelce are planning their wedding for June 13, 2026. Rumor has it they paid a ""hefty sum"" to a bride who had already booked the ultra-luxury Ocean House resort (located right next to Taylor’s mansion) just to secure the date.





The $1.7M ""Family Home"" Renovation: Taylor has been spotted several times this off-season at her Watch Hill estate, known as Holiday House. She recently filed permits for a massive $1.7 million renovation, adding a new bedroom wing and ""enlarged guest suites,"" fueling rumors of a permanent move or a massive pre-wedding ""girls' trip"" retreat.



While Taylor Swift is indeed taking over the Rhode Island news cycle right now, she isn't actually trying to purchase the state. Here is the fact check on the rumor that has Swifties and locals alike scratching their heads.The Claim: A viral post on X (formerly Twitter) claims Taylor Swift is in legal talks to purchase the state of Rhode Island to ensure ""total privacy"" for an upcoming girls' trip.The rumor is a satirical take on two very real, very high-profile stories involving Taylor and the ""Ocean State"" this February:The joke likely stems from the ""Taylor Swift Tax."" In late 2025, Rhode Island lawmakers proposed a luxury tax on high-value second homes left empty for more than half the year. Because Taylor’s $17M+ mansion is the most famous example, the bill was nicknamed after her.Fans on X have since joked that if the state is going to tax her like she owns the place, she might as well ""buy the whole thing.""Taylor doesn't need to buy a state for privacy, she already owns one of the most secluded bluffs in New England. Her property, High Watch, sits on 5.23 acres with a 700-foot private beach. While she frequently hosts her ""squad"" for July 4th and off-season getaways, she relies on a world-class security team not a deed to the state to keep the paparazzi at bay.","A viral post on X (formerly Twitter) claims Taylor Swift is in legal talks to purchase the state of Rhode Island.

Dave Ryding reflects on Olympic career, final season goals, and historic impact on British alpine skiing

Dave Ryding stood at the finish line knowing a long chapter of his life was ending. The 39-year-old British skier delivered an emotional message after his final Olympic race at the Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Games. Speaking through tears, Dave Ryding signaled that retirement was near, closing a journey that inspired winter sports fans for more than a decade.Ryding finished 17th in the men’s slalom in Bormio. While it was not a medal result, the moment still mattered deeply. He was among only 46 skiers who completed the difficult race out of 96 starters, showing his determination until the very end. Soon after the race, he opened his heart about the future. “We’ll see, we’ll see. To be honest, I feel like it’s time,” he said, as reported by TNT. His words made clear that the Olympic stage had likely seen his final run.Emotion-filled Ryding’s voice as he described the end of his career. “I will never look back and think ‘What if?’ I will never look back and think, ‘Did I retire too early?’ I gave it my all right until the end, and it was a hell of a ride,” he said.

He also thanked the people who supported him through years of training and competition.Now, as retirement approaches, Ryding leaves behind more than results.

Why Stefon Diggs and Cardi B called it quits after Super Bowl LX,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/why-stefon-diggs-and-cardi-b-called-it-quits-after-super-bowl-lx/articleshow/128473447.cms,"Stefon Diggs, Cardi B (Getty Images)

2. A Disastrous Week on the Field and in Court

3. The ""Little Miss Drama"" Confirmation

""Just because I ain’t f*ing with my baby daddy doesn't mean you get to talk about my baby daddy!""

For New England Patriots star Stefon Diggs, February 8, 2026, was supposed to be the pinnacle of his career. Instead, it became the week he lost it all: the Lombardi Trophy, his spotless reputation, and his high-profile relationship with Cardi B Just nine days after the Patriots' crushing 29–13 loss to the Seattle Seahawks, the ""Super Bowl LX Curse"" has officially claimed its most famous couple. Here is the breakdown of the three reasons why the most talked-about romance of 2025 collapsed in real-time.The breaking point allegedly occurred before the coin toss even happened. Viral footage from the Super Bowl sidelines showed a woman known as Pree (previously linked to Cardi’s ex, Offset) wearing an official ""WAGs"" credential and shaking hands with Diggs.Tensions boiled over when Pree was spotted sitting in the Diggs family section, mere rows away from where Cardi B was expected to sit. While Cardi performed a high-energy halftime cameo with Bad Bunny, she notably ""vanished"" immediately after her set, skipping the rest of the game and the post-game festivities.Winning heals all wounds, but losing Super Bowl LX only exposed the fractures. Diggs finished the game with a lackluster 3 catches for 37 yards, leading to brutal trolling from fans and rappers like BIA and 50 Cent.Compounding the sports failure was a mounting legal crisis. On February 13, just days after the loss, Diggs reportedly had to address a felony strangulation charge involving his former private chef. The combination of professional failure and legal drama reportedly led Cardi, who has been in ""protection mode"" since welcoming their son, in November 2025 to finally pull the plug.Cardi B officially signaled the end of the road during her ""Little Miss Drama"" Tour stop at the Kia Forum on February 15. In a viral moment that has since dominated TikTok, Cardi addressed a diss from BIA by telling the crowd:The statement served as a dual-purpose announcement: it confirmed the breakup while asserting that Diggs is still ""family"" and off-limits to outsiders.By Monday morning, both stars had scrubbed their Instagram feeds of each other and hit the ""unfollow"" button. While sources say that a reconciliation is ""possible"" once the Super Bowl dust settles, Cardi’s focus is clearly on her record-breaking tour and her four children. For now, the Diggs-Cardi era is officially in the rearview mirror.","Stefon Diggs and Cardi B broke up just nine days after the Super Bowl.

Todd Stepsis, Adam Sutherland and Mitch Moore share emotional words about Parker Sutherland

The University of Northern Iowa football team is grieving after the sudden death of 18 year old tight end Parker Sutherland. The freshman player collapsed during a team workout on Thursday, February 12, and passed away two days later on Saturday, February 14. Head coach Todd Stepsis shared the update during a press conference on Monday, February 16. He said the team had just finished its normal warm up when something went wrong.“We get right through our warm-up in a routine, normal Thursday and he collapsed,” Todd Stepsis told reporters. “For whatever reason, right after that warm-up, something happened. We’re not really sure what it was.” First responders arrived at the football facility that morning. Parker Sutherland was taken to a local hospital. As of now, no official cause of death has been shared. The loss has shaken the UNI campus and the Iowa football community.On Monday, students, teammates and coaches gathered on campus to remember Parker Sutherland. His father, Adam Sutherland, spoke during the memorial and shared simple, loving memories of his son.“I mean that poor kid, he didn’t even know how good looking he was,” Adam Sutherland said.“He never did his hair. He wore black on black. It was just, ‘Hey, go back downstairs and change.’ ‘Okay, why?’ It didn’t phase him. He didn’t care. He didn’t care the littlest of anything. He didn’t care about what he wore, what he bought. All he wanted to do was eat and sleep, and hang out with the fellas. That’s it. And build Legos. Honestly. ”Coach Todd Stepsis also spoke through tears.“If I could have 110 Parkers I would,” he said. “We’re not going to be able to replace him, but who he is as a person, he always had a smile on his face, he always made people feel good about themselves, it’s not about replacing him, but finding something extra inside to help fill that gap and close that void with him being gone.”In an earlier statement on Saturday, Todd Stepsis said he was “heartbroken.”“Parker embodied everything we look for in a UNI Football Panther,” he said. “His talent and potential excited us on a daily basis, but it failed to compare to the type of person and teammate he was. His character, humility, toughness and genuine love of others are what champions are made of.”The Northern Iowa athletic department also released a statement offering support to students and staff. Parker Sutherland, who was from Iowa City, played in four games during his freshman season in 2025. His high school coach, Mitch Moore, told the Des Moines Register that Parker was “a larger-than-life figure because of the way he lived his life” and “took so much pride in being a positive influence to the young kids in our community. ”“He was put on this earth to make everybody better and he certainly did,” Mitch Moore said.A celebration of life is set for Sunday, February 22, as family, friends and teammates prepare to honor his memory.","University of Northern Iowa tight end Parker Sutherland, 18, collapsed during a team workout on Thursday, February 12.

Nelly Korda balances Tiger Woods partnership, TGL criticism, and strong return to form in 2026 season

Nelly Korda and Tiger Woods are back in the spotlight together, but this time the story is about business and timing. Just days after Nelly Korda publicly questioned the new tech-driven TGL league backed by Tiger Woods, she stepped into a fresh partnership connected to him. The move surprised many fans because her earlier comments raised concerns about missed opportunities for women’s golf. Still, the World No. 2 quickly shifted focus toward a new chapter. Korda announced a major agreement with Upper Deck, a global leader in sports trading cards and memorabilia that already works with Woods.The partnership will bring her image to trading cards, collectibles, and long-term branding projects starting in 2026. Sharing her excitement, Korda said, “I’ve seen firsthand the passion and joy that collecting brings to so many people. It isn’t just about creating collectibles; it’s about working with a company that knows how to best represent your brand and connect with fans all over the world.” Her decision shows a balance between speaking honestly about the sport and building new opportunities beyond the course.Before the partnership news, Korda had openly shared mixed feelings about TGL.She said, “I think it’s a huge and unbelievable mistake that we’re not playing alongside the men. There’s no greater way to grow the game, and it would have been revolutionary.” At the same time, she added, “I also think it’s great that we are getting this opportunity, so that’s my mixed feelings.”While that debate continued, her focus returned to performance. The 27-year-old entered 2026 after a frustrating 2025 season where she went winless in 20 starts. Even so, she still recorded nine top-10 finishes and earned about $2.8 million, showing her level never truly dropped. Looking back, she admitted on The Lads YouTube channel, “A year without missing cuts, but I’d rather actually miss a couple and win… there were flashes of really great golf. ”Her response came quickly in 2026. Korda ended a 14-month win drought by capturing the Hilton Grand Vacations Tournament of Champions, proving she remains one of the best players in the world. With confidence rising again, she is preparing for a busy schedule that includes the Mexico Riviera Maya Open at Mayakoba, the Amundi Evian Championship, the AIG Women’s British Open at Royal Lytham, and the Solheim Cup in the Netherlands.Together, the business partnership and on-course comeback show an athlete shaping her future in more ways than one. Korda continues to speak openly, compete strongly, and expand her global presence, often in the same headlines as Tiger Woods.","Nelly Korda announced a major agreement with Upper Deck, a global leader in sports trading cards and memorabilia.

Tyson Fury is stepping back into boxing again, and this time the biggest debate is not about his opponent but it is about his family. The former heavyweight champion, who announced retirement after losing twice to Oleksandr Usyk in late 2024, is returning to the ring for another comeback fight scheduled in London. Fury’s decision has already sparked strong reactions, especially from his father, John Fury, who publicly said he is unhappy with the way things are going.The comeback has quickly become a talking point because Fury’s inner circle appears divided. While the boxer is focused on training and preparing for his next challenge, his family worries about his health and the direction of his career. Reports also suggest tension at home, making the buildup to his return feel more personal than sporting. As Fury prepares for another high-pressure fight, questions about family support and long-term safety are growing louder.John Fury has openly shared his frustration, saying he feels pushed away from his son’s team. Speaking to the Daily Mail, he explained that people around Tyson have influenced their relationship.He said, “I don’t think he listens to me because of the people around him. I just think there have been that many people in his ear about me… If you get told enough times, ‘your father’s this, your father’s that,’ you start believing it.”John has worked closely with Tyson since the start of his career, so his comments carry weight. Even though he supports his son’s return, he wants him fully prepared.He added, “I want to see him coming in against this man with a pair of shoulders, big, solid, muscled up for him. I don’t want to see a thin, fat guy who’s done a bit of skipping and some bag work.”Tyson Fury has also admitted family relationships have been tense.In another interview with the Daily Mail, he said his father, brothers, and even his wife Paris had stopped speaking to him for a period.At the same time, Fury says recent events made him rethink life and push toward another fight.Now, as the London bout gets closer, the focus is not only on boxing skills but also on whether Tyson Fury can balance family pressure, public expectation, and one more shot at success inside the ring.","Tyson Fury is returning to the ring for another comeback fight scheduled in London.

George Pickens drama exposes Cowboys’ double standard on accountability as Jerry Jones defends troubled star,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/george-pickens-drama-exposes-cowboys-double-standard-on-accountability-as-jerry-jones-defends-troubled-star/articleshow/128463929.cms,"(Image 1 via Instagram and Image 2 via Getty: George Pickens and Jerry Jones)

Could George Pickens be Micah Parsons 2.0 with Jerry Jones or would franchise tag help?

Would Jerry Jones negotiate with David Mulugheta for George Pickens?

ESPN’s Todd Archer reported that the Dallas Cowboys had issues with wide receiver George Pickens arriving on time, which led to internal punishment. Archer’s sources said Pickens was fined during the season.However, when Cowboys owner Jerry Jones was asked about it, he downplayed the issue, saying, “I’ve missed a few [meetings] myself,” and called Pickens an outstanding teammate. This leniency could suggest a double standard on accountability by the Cowboys, especially after Micah Parsons’ chapter in the 2025 season.The contract negotiations and disputes that dominated the 2025 offseason for Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones and defensive end Micah Parsons may resume with wide receiver George Pickens. Pickens had 93 receptions for 1,429 yards and nine touchdowns in 2025. This is his final contract year.After his strong performance last year, he is expected to demand more. However, reports say a franchise tag worth $27 to 28 million could be applied to Pickens.ESPN’s Todd Archer reports that players do not want a franchise tag because, even if fully guaranteed, it does not provide long-term security. Teams often use it as a stepping-stone toward a long-term agreement.If Pickens does not favor this, and since David Mulugheta, Micah Parsons’ agent, also represents Pickens, there is a slim chance Pickens could become Parsons 2.0 for the 2026 season.Parsons attended the mandatory minicamp and training camp but did not practice. The relationship was strained and he was traded to the Green Bay Packers for Kenny Clark in exchange.Archer reported that the franchise tag could guarantee Pickens’ stay for the 2026 season, but it also raises the possibility he might skip the offseason program, minicamp, or training camp.“I don’t know. We’ll see how it goes. Probably both. But I expect to be speaking with George [Pickens],” Jerry Jones said on 105.3 The Fan in early January when asked about the upcoming negotiations with Pickens, who shares an agent [David Mulugheta] with Parsons.Sports Illustrated’s Randy Gurzi reported that Jones doesn’t believe he did anything wrong [with Parsons chapter], and states that Parsons is the one who backed out of a deal [five-year contract worth nearly $202.5 million].Instead of learning from this and agreeing to keep Mulugheta in the loop, Jones still believes he should negotiate directly with the players.","George Pickens had 93 receptions for 1,429 yards and nine touchdowns in 2025.

Brad Marchand Team Canada quarterfinal lineup decision against Latvia explained



Before the Olympic quarterfinals, Team Canada's lineup talks have gotten more serious. Veteran forward Brad Marchand is expected to rejoin the team. The return of the experienced winger, who had been out of earlier games, has been a big topic of conversation in recent NHL updates. Analysts are trying to figure out how his presence could change the team's balance during the elimination stage.Jon Cooper, the head coach, now has to make a big decision that takes into account performance, chemistry, and tactical needs. Younger players have brought energy to the tournament, but when the pressure is on in knockout hockey, the focus often shifts to proven veterans. This situation has sparked debate among insiders and fans about which player should make room for Marchand.Brad Marchand, representing Team Canada, is set to play in the Olympic quarterfinal matchup against Latvia after being a healthy scratch in previous games. The Boston Bruins forward is widely recognized for his playoff-style intensity and leadership, qualities that many believe could be crucial in high-pressure elimination contests.Craig Button, an NHL insider, recently said that the Carolina Hurricanes could take Seth Jarvis out of the lineup to make room for Marchand, and Button said that even though Jarvis is fast and skilled, Team Canada might put more value on physicality, defensive awareness, and experience deeper in the lineup during knockout play.Jon Cooper's choice will probably take into account both the matchup and the chemistry of the team, and Canada may focus on structured forechecking and veteran calmness against Latvia, especially as the tournament moves into win-or-go-home situations.","Brad Marchand, representing Team Canada, is set to play in the Olympic quarterfinal matchup against Latvia after being a healthy scratch in previous games.

T20 World Cup: Leave Abhishek Sharma alone!,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-mens-t20-world-cup/t20-world-cup-leave-abhishek-sharma-alone/articleshow/128474472.cms,"Despite a challenging start to the T20 World Cup with two ducks and a stomach infection, Abhishek Sharma will look to get going in the dead rubber against the Netherlands. The Indian team's batting coach Sitanshu Kotak remains confident in his aggressive approach, highlighting that opponents' meticulous planning against him is a testament to his threat.

TimesofIndia.com in Ahmedabad:

Gautam Gambhir works overtime with Tilak Varma in the nets

Abhishek Sharma

If we start stressing so much, I think players will be under unnecessary pressure. So he's in a good form. He's got clear plans. He's got a clear mindset. And that is what matters Sitanshu Kotak

Abhishek Sharma is yet to get off the mark in the ongoing T20 World Cup. (PTI)

An hour before the Indian cricket team's scheduled arrival at the Narendra Modi Stadium, the groundstaff was in overdrive with their preparations. Rolling was underway on the practice square and the makeshift nets were placed around the pitches the Men in Blue would use for their first, and only, session at the venue ahead of the final group game against the Netherlands in the T20 World Cup.The Super Eight berth is already sealed following three convincing wins, but this game will attract significant interest. First, because the same venue will host the Super Eight clash against South Africa on February 22 and second, and more importantly, due to Abhishek Sharma.All the pre-tournament build-up focused on the dashing opener from Punjab. Since breaking into the team, the belligerent southpaw carved a reputation for his consistent destruction at the top of the order, and he was the sole reason opponents burned the midnight oil while planning his downfall.Meticulous planning by the opposition -- the USA and Pakistan -- means he is yet to score his first run in the World Cup. A severe stomach infection, sandwiched between those two contests, hasn't helped either.A golden duck in the tournament opener was followed by a four-ball duck against Pakistan in Colombo. Prior to these outings, the 25-year-old, who enjoys a healthy average of 35.05 and a menacing strike-rate of 193.29 in the format, failed to open his account twice in the five-T20I series vs New Zealand at home.Four ducks in the last seven innings is not the ideal reading for a player who has instilled fear in opponents. On Wednesday he gets another opportunity to regain his form before the T20 World Cup's business end gets underway. The optional nets session on the eve of the game was a long and lonely grind for the opener who spent significant time working on his range against spinners Varun Chakravarthy and Washington Sundar. The usual big ones were on display but they weren't the cleanest hits with the sweetest sound off the bat.​​​Rightly so, he was allowed a free hand during the hit as head coach Gautam Gambhir stood behind the net where Tilak Varma and Rinku Singh were batting. The bat flow and swing are such integral parts of his batting that the moment they return to normal, runs flow at the pace everyone is used to seeing from the left-hander. Even when the connection wasn't ideal, Abhishek achieved a better flow and extended his elbows well while navigating different pockets of the stadium.""Last game he got out in first over. So one thing we definitely do, we unnecessarily don't over-analyse,"" was batting coach Sitanshu Kotak's response when asked about Abhishek's failures in two outings.""He is someone who has got his plan sorted and he follows the way he wants to and obviously we discuss about the opposition, their bowling, their bowling strength, whatever they've been doing in the last few games they've played. All that is normal for everyone, not only for Abhishek,"" added the coach.​India have followed a high-risk template in T20Is under captain Suryakumar Yadav and coach Gautam Gambhir. Every batter's primary intent has mostly been to pressure the bowlers from the start. This dominance explains their strong run in the format and why they have been a high-scoring team in the bilaterals preceding the multi-nation tournament.""Abhishek has made runs in the matches before that. Now in the T20 format, sometimes in 10 balls, 30 runs are just as important. Secondly, honestly, we focus on all the batters or all the players. We don't think that one player didn't get his runs. Because in T20, there is a high-risk game, somewhere or the other, a player will get out. If we start stressing so much, I think players will be under unnecessary pressure. So he's in a good form. He's got clear plans. He's got a clear mindset. And that is what matters for us,"" Kotak explained when asked about the team's mindset.The coach is instead looking at the brighter side. He is very happy that the teams are worked up about keeping Abhishek quiet. Pakistan head coach Mike Hesson's admission after the defeat to India was the latest instance of how opponents have identified the fearless batter as the real deal in the Indian line-up.""See, first of all, a lot of credit to Abhishek, if they plan and talk about him. Because I am sure he must be doing that well, that they are so concerned about Abhishek. But we plan, he also comes up with his ideas. Even in the last game, I don't think anyone can plan to get him out at mid-on. He sat up and got out. That's okay. And if they are so concerned, that's a great sign for us and it's great credit to him the way he plays,"" said Kotak.For a setup that has successfully embraced the high-risk template, the focus remains on playing the situation and doing what the team demands at that stage. Just as Suryakumar had to dig deep against the USA, and both he and Tilak had to hold their shots when Pakistan applied the spin choke in Colombo.""I think playing aggressive cricket is important but not because of a player's couple of failure will change. If anything, the plans will change according to situation. So no matter whether somebody has scored runs for two innings or not, or somebody... But it's more what team needs at that time, in that conditions,"" explained Kotak.However, the same rules don't apply to Abhishek. He doesn't play by the regular book and has a very straightforward approach. See the ball, whack the ball. While the think-tank isn't losing sleep over his lack of runs, the entire nation will surely sleep well, and opponents will return to sleepless nights, if Abhishek returns to form and adds significantly to his T20 World Cup tally — which is yet to get off the mark.","Abhishek Sharma yet to get off the mark in the ongoing T20 World Cup.

You know Deion Sanders. The man who embodies ""swagger."" The legend who taught us how to. He’s the guy who commands a locker room, inspires thousands, and makes oversized sunglasses look cool indoors. But put him in a spa? Suddenly, ""Prime Time"" looks more like ""Awkward Time. ""A viral clip from Valentine's Day weekend 2026, courtesy of his ever-patient girlfriend, Karrueche Tran, gave us all a glimpse into a side of Coach Prime we never knew we needed: the spa virgin.Deion Sanders who was under a fluffy white robe, fully dressed, including his sneakers, for a SPA. Karrueche documented the hilarious struggle to get her man to relax.he declared, his voice a perfect blend of skepticism and defiance. The man who once dared to play two NFL games in one day was suddenly rendered powerless by a massage table and the concept of disrobing in front of a stranger.It’s peak Coach Prime, isn’t it? The same unshakeable conviction he brings to the sideline, ""We comin'!"" he brings to his spa reluctance. He's not just resisting a massage, he’s resisting an entire. It's a hilarious peek behind the curtain, reminding us that even legends have their kryptonite, and for Deion, it might just be essential oils and communal changing rooms.But let’s be real, this viral chuckle-fest has a deeper, incredibly sweet backstory. This seemingly lighthearted moment shows Karrueche’s and Deion’s sweet romance. Just last year, Coach Prime faced a brutal battle with aggressive bladder cancer, undergoing major surgery and a long recovery. He even admitted to Karrueche that he ""gave her an out,"" offering her an escape from the hardship. Her response? A resounding ""no,"" affirming that God brought them together and she wasn't going anywhere.So, when Karrueche posted the spa clip, it wasn't just about a funny anecdote. It was a victory lap. It was her gently, persistently, and with a whole lot of love, pulling her man away from the relentless grind and into the realm of self-care and relaxation. After being declared cancer-free, this is Karrueche’s mission: to get Deion to ""start living"" and enjoy the life he’s built.He might not be shedding his clothes for a stranger, but he's showing up. He's trying. And honestly, that's more endearing than any perfectly executed deep tissue massage. Deion Sanders in a full outfit under a spa robe isn’t just a meme; it’s a beautiful, awkward, and profoundly human symbol of resilience, partnership, and the hilarious lengths we go to for love.So next time you're feeling a little out of your comfort zone, just remember Coach Prime, sneakers still on, defying the very essence of a spa day. And remember, sometimes, just showing up (even fully clothed) is half the battle.","Deion Sanders and girlfriend Karrueche Tran went to a spa together.

Germany depends on Leon Draisaitl’s brilliance to lead them to the semifinals



With Germany routing France earlier tonight, the Olympic Quarterfinals are looking clearer than ever. Leon Draisaitl , despite the scare from the last game, was able to book his side’s ticket against the Slovaks, who have been the biggest dark horse in this tournament.Both sides boast some of the best names in the game, with Slovakia’s Juraj Slafkovsky giving guys like Connor McDavid a run for his money. Wednesday will see the knockout game unfold with both teams in red-hot form and eager to get that Podium Finish.Germany rode Draisaitl's brilliance past France in the qualification round, with the Oilers captain recording a goal and two assists in a dominant 5-1 win. He became the first German NHL player to record a three-point game at the Olympics and has six points in four games alongside Tim Stutzle, who is tied for the tournament lead in goals with four.Slovakia arrives having clinched Group B on goal differential despite a 5-3 loss to Sweden in their final game. Slafkovsky has been nothing short of spectacular, taking his place among the tournament's elite performers with three goals and three assists in three games.Draisaitl enters Wednesday's game fully locked in after an uneven preliminary round. Germany dropped two of three group games before their captain flipped the switch against France, barking orders at teammates and commanding the ice for more than 24 minutes.Coach Harold Kreis deployed Draisaitl, Stutzle, and JJ Peterka on the same line against France to devastating effect. Germany converted two power-play goals in the win and appears ready to challenge for a medal if that trio continues producing at this level.Slafovsky is the engine that makes Slovakia tick. Forward Dalibor Dvorsky has provided crucial support with four points in three games, while defenseman Martin Gernat contributes offensively from the blue line.The statistical gap in penalties tells an important story heading into Wednesday's game. Slovakia has accumulated 30 penalty minutes through the preliminary round, while Germany leads the tournament in discipline alongside Czechia with just 16 minutes in the box.Slovakia's penalty kill has absorbed the damage at 83.33 percent efficiency, but facing Draisaitl, Stutzle, and Moritz Seider on the power play represents a different challenge entirely. Germany's disciplined approach could prove the decisive edge.Draisaitl acknowledged Slovakia's quality directly after the France win, calling them a deep team that finished first in their group for a reason. Germany has won both previous Olympic meetings with Slovakia, but this quarterfinal, with a semifinal berth on the line, figures to be decided by the finest of margins.",Germany face Slovakia in the quarterfinals on Wednesday. Leon Draisaitl is the first German NHL player to record a three-point game at the Olympics and has six points in four games. Juraj Slafkovsky has been nothing short of spectacular with three goals and three assists in three games.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128475054,imgsize-76522,width-400,resizemode-4/juraj-slafovsky.jpg"

Top three landing spots for Jeff Skinner’s next NHL return after contract termination

DIVORCE: San Jose Sharks Release Jeff Skinner—Which TEAM Will SIGN NHL's Scoring Talent?

As veteran forward Jeff Skinner was placed on unconditional waivers by the San Jose Sharks to terminate his one-year, $3 million contract on Monday, speculations are doing the rounds about what could be the next potential landing spot for the San Jose Sharks player. Earlier announcing the same, Elliotte Friedman of Sportsnet stated, “Jeff Skinner (SJ) on unconditional waivers for purposes of contract termination.”As per reports, Skinner joined the Sharks on a one-year deal worth $3 million that he signed in July, followed by a similar arrangement with the Edmonton Oilers for the previous season. He was last seen on January 11 against the Vegas Golden Knights. As several NHL teams are looking for players to acquire before the NHL trade deadline, here are the top three landing spots that could be Skinner's next possible NHL move.In a significant roster move, veteran forward Jeff Skinner was placed on unconditional waivers by the San Jose Sharks on Monday to terminate his one-year, $3 million contract. Skinner, who managed just 6 goals and 13 points in 32 games this season before becoming a healthy scratch on January 11, is now an unrestricted free agent seeking a new team amid the Olympic break.As per speculations, the Los Angeles Kings could be an interesting potential landing spot for Skinner after some injury news this week.Earlier, the Kings confirmed that the left winger Kevin Fiala is out for the rest of the regular season due to a major injury in his lower left leg during the Olympics. It would make sense for them to add another skilled forward. Hence, that could be one possibility for Skinner.While Skinner may not be as effective a player as Fiala at this stage of his career, he could give the Kings some secondary scoring if he bounces back. He wouldn't have to move too far from San Jose, either.The Tampa Bay Lightning is another possibility where Skinner would give them another option for their third line. He could even be a useful extra forward to have around for the Lightning, especially with their injury trouble this season, as reported by The Hockey News on Tuesday.Apart from this, Skinner could provide the Avalanche's fourth line with a bit more offense, accompanying rookies like Gavin Brindley and Zakhar Bardakov, who have scored 11 and nine points in 42 games, respectively. Skinner would also give them another option for their struggling power play success rate, which currently stands at 15.1. It would now be interesting to see which team would opt for Jeff Skinner, as his termination has almost been confirmed from the San Jose Sharks’ end.","Jeff Skinner was placed on unconditional waivers by the San Jose Sharks on Monday to terminate his one-year, $3 million contract.

Jutta Leerdam wins Olympic gold at Milano Cortina 2026 as Jake Paul reacts emotionally

Jutta Leerdam did not suffer any wardrobe malfunction at the Winter Olympics. The viral video spreading online does not show her. The crash in the clip actually involved another Dutch skater, Suzanne Schulting, at a different event months earlier. Despite this, several social media posts wrongly claimed that the athlete in the video was ice skater Jutta Leerdam and that the fall happened during the Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics.The confusion began after Leerdam won gold at the Milano Cortina 2026 Games. An X account, @nexta_tv, shared the crash video and wrote, “Speed skating went massively viral at the 2026 Winter Olympics - all thanks to Dutch athlete Jutta Leerdam.” The post quickly gained attention. But the claim is false. NU.nl reports that the viral video shows events that occurred in December 2025 during an ISU Speed Skating World Cup match in Hamar Norway. The skater in the video was Suzanne Schulting, not Jutta Leerdam. Schulting crashed during her 500 meter race after she lost control of her balance.After the race, Suzanne Schulting spoke to NU.nl. She said, “I felt good and was really looking forward to it.But it turned out to be a terrible evening.” She added, “I have not watched the footage yet, but it is possible I caught myself. Physically, I am fine; I just have a scrape on my hip. But it is obviously very frustrating.” When she fell, her skating suit tore above her hip. Speaking about that moment, she told NU.nl, “I did not notice it at first. After the race, I covered it up immediately, but as a woman, that is obviously not nice. It makes this evening even more awkward.” Despite the tear, Suzanne Schulting got up and quickly finished the race.While the old crash video was going viral, speed skater Jutta Leerdam was making history in Italy. The 27 year old Dutch speed skater won the women’s 1000 meter race at the Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics. She finished in 1:12.31 and beat fellow Dutch skater Femke Kok’s newly set Olympic record.Right after the race, boxer Jake Paul was seen in tears in the stands. He later shared a video on Instagram where he lifted olympian Jutta Leerdam, who was wearing her olympic gold medal, and kissed her. In the caption, he wrote, “we just witnessed one of the most important sporting moments ever. the doc will tell. words cant describe how proud of you i am. @juttaleerdam.”In another post, he shared photos and wrote, “Still ugly crying over this, you’re unreal.”So to be clear, the wardrobe malfunction video does not feature Jutta Leerdam and did not happen at the 2026 Winter Olympics. It shows Suzanne Schulting at a World Cup event in Norway months earlier.","Jutta Leerdam did not suffer any wardrobe malfunction at the Winter Olympics.

Olympian Fred Kerley legal battle ends after battery case dropped and attorney praises prosecutors for final decision,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/international-sports/olympian-fred-kerley-legal-battle-ends-after-battery-case-dropped-and-attorney-praises-prosecutors-for-final-decision/articleshow/128475891.cms,"Olympian Fred Kerley legal battle ends after battery case dropped and attorney praises prosecutors for final decision (Image Via Getty Images)

Fred Kerley case details and lawyer Richard L. Cooper explains why prosecutors dropped the battery charge

Olympian Fred Kerley is back in the headlines, but this time for a legal update rather than a race. The battery charge against Fred Kerley was dropped on Tuesday, his lawyer confirmed after a court appearance in Florida. The decision ends a case that began with his arrest in May 2025.Kerley, a two-time Olympic medalist, shared the news with fans on Instagram soon after leaving court. He wrote, “Pressure built me, it didn’t break me. Case dismissed. Victory secured.” He added, “You can’t stop destiny. It’s up from here.” His attorney, Richard L. Cooper, said prosecutors made the correct choice and noted that Kerley had maintained his innocence from the start. The update closes a difficult chapter while allowing the track star to focus again on his athletic career.According to Kerley’s lawyer, the charge was connected to an arrest on May 1, 2025. Police alleged Kerley struck his former girlfriend, Olympic hurdler Alaysha Johnson, during an argument. Johnson told officers she met Kerley at a conditioning appointment for an upcoming track and field event. She claimed the disagreement became physical and said her nose began to bleed.Officers noted in their report that “Johnson's injuries were consistent with her statements. ”Despite the allegation, Kerley denied wrongdoing from the beginning. His attorney later said, “He had a target on his back,” while also thanking prosecutors for their final decision. “We're grateful prosecutors made the right choice and did the right thing,” Cooper added.The Office of the State Attorney explained why the case could not continue. Officials said the trial was scheduled, but the alleged victim was unavailable to appear in court. The judge did not allow a delay request, meaning “the state could not go forward and had to drop the charge.” Because of this, the case ended without a conviction.For Kerley, the outcome removes a major distraction. The American sprinter has earned global recognition through Olympic medals and world-class sprint performances. Legal challenges had briefly shifted attention away from his achievements on the track. Now, with the charge dismissed, focus may return to his training and future competitions.So far, Kerley has not announced specific upcoming race plans. Still, his public message suggests confidence about what comes next. After months of uncertainty, the court decision provides closure and a chance to move forward in both sport and life.","Olympian Fred Kerley's battery charge was dropped on Tuesday, his lawyer confirmed.

Jesse Jackson Death: Why civil rights activist wanted to cut off Barack Obama's...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/jesse-jackson-death-why-civil-rights-activist-wanted-to-cut-off-barack-obamas-manhood/articleshow/128461505.cms,"To understand why Jackson reacted so viscerally to Obama, one must first understand who he was. Long before Obama’s rise, Jesse Jackson was the closest thing America had to a national Black political candidate. Born in segregated South Carolina, he came of age in the crucible of the civil rights movement. As a young organiser, he worked alongside Martin Luther King Jr., participated in marches across the South, and became known for his fiery oratory and instinct for political mobilisation.

In the summer of 2008, as Barack Obama ’s improbable march toward the White House gathered momentum, an ageing civil rights titan leaned over during a television break, unaware that his microphone was still live, and whispered words that would instantly become one of the most startling political hot-mic moments in modern American history. Jesse Jackson, veteran of marches, jail cells, presidential campaigns, and moral crusades, muttered that Obama had been “talking down to black people” and that he wanted to cut off his manhood.It was crude, shocking, and deeply human all at once. It captured something larger than a scandal. It revealed the complicated generational tensions within Black American politics at a historic moment. And in many ways, it perfectly embodied the contradictions of Jesse Jackson himself, who has now died at 84, leaving behind a life that was as consequential as it was colourful.To understand why Jackson reacted so viscerally to Obama, one must first understand who he was. Long before Obama’s rise, Jesse Jackson was the closest thing America had to a national Black political candidate. Born in segregated South Carolina, he came of age in the crucible of the civil rights movement. As a young organiser, he worked alongside Martin Luther King Jr., participated in marches across the South, and became known for his fiery oratory and instinct for political mobilisation.Jackson did not merely inherit King’s legacy after the assassination. He transformed it. Where King focused primarily on civil rights and moral persuasion, Jackson broadened the fight into economic justice and political power. Through Operation Breadbasket and later his PUSH organisation, he pressured corporations to hire Black workers and invest in Black communities. He became a bridge between protest movements and political institutions.In the 1980s, he attempted something revolutionary. He ran for president not as a symbolic protest candidate but as a serious contender. His “Rainbow Coalition” sought to unite minorities, working-class whites, farmers, labour unions, and progressive activists into a new political bloc. In 1984 and 1988, his campaigns fundamentally reshaped Democratic Party politics, forcing the party to engage more deeply with issues of racial inequality, poverty, and social justice.For a generation of Black Americans, Jackson represented possibility. He was the first to show that a Black candidate could win primaries, command national attention, and influence policy debates. Without his campaigns, Obama’s presidency would have been far harder to imagine.Yet Jackson was never a saintly figure carved in marble. He was a restless, controversial, often polarising personality. His career included diplomatic missions to free American hostages abroad, dramatic confrontations with political leaders, and a long record of rhetorical missteps. He apologised more than once for offensive remarks or impulsive statements. He could be inspiring and divisive in the same breath.The 2008 Obama incident fit into this pattern, but it also carried deeper emotional significance. Jackson had spent decades urging Black Americans to demand structural change from the political system. When Obama, during a Father’s Day speech, emphasised personal responsibility among Black families, Jackson felt the message ignored systemic injustices like unemployment, housing crises, and inequality.To Jackson, Obama seemed to be shifting the conversation from collective struggle to individual morality. To many younger Black leaders, however, Obama represented a new strategy: broadening appeal to win power within mainstream institutions.The clash was not simply personal. It was generational. Jackson came from an era of street protests, confrontation, and racial solidarity politics. Obama emerged from a world of coalition-building, technocratic messaging, and post-racial rhetoric.In the end, Jackson quickly apologised. Obama accepted the apology. The moment faded from headlines. But it left behind a symbolic imprint. It showed that even within movements for justice, change often produces tension between pioneers and successors.Jackson’s long life was defined by such tensions. He stood at the intersection of activism and politics, morality and pragmatism, unity and controversy. He could negotiate with foreign dictators one year and lead domestic protests the next. He spoke in the language of scripture yet navigated the gritty realities of electoral power.Perhaps that is why he remained relevant for so long. Jackson was never just a relic of the 1960s. He continuously reinvented himself, adapting to new political landscapes while maintaining his core commitment to justice and equality.In his later years, even as illness limited his public appearances, his presence remained symbolic. He was a living link to the civil rights era, a reminder that progress did not arrive through inevitability but through struggle, sacrifice, and relentless advocacy.The hot-mic remark about Obama, embarrassing as it was, ultimately humanised him. It revealed a man who felt deeply invested in the cause he had spent his life advancing. It showed a veteran activist grappling with the fact that history was moving forward, sometimes in ways he did not fully recognise.Now, with his passing, that history feels more distant. Jesse Jackson leaves behind a complicated legacy, one that includes towering achievements, controversial moments, and enduring influence. He was a preacher, a protester, a politician, and above all, a relentless voice for those he believed had been left behind.In American political life, few figures embodied both the promise and the contradictions of social change as vividly as Jesse Jackson. And perhaps that is why even his most awkward moments, including one caught by an open microphone, continue to echo as reminders that history is made not by perfect heroes, but by passionate, flawed, and fiercely human individuals.","Long before Obama’s rise, Jesse Jackson was the closest thing America had to a national Black political candidate.

Buffalo Sabres' Tage Thompson Gets Taste of Playoff Hockey at Olympics Without NHL Experience,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/buffalo-sabres-tage-thompson-gets-taste-of-playoff-hockey-at-olympics-without-nhl-experience/articleshow/128479271.cms,"Tage Thompson with the Buffalo Sabres (Via Getty Images)

Tage Thompson never expected that he would get this chance



Tage Thompson has waited his entire NHL career to experience playoff hockey. The Buffalo Sabres have missed the postseason in each of his seven professional seasons, denying the talented center any taste of high-stakes, elimination hockey.That changes Wednesday when Team USA faces either Sweden or Latvia in the Olympic quarterfinals at Santagiulia Arena. Thompson finds himself on the third line alongside Dylan Larkin and Clayton Keller, preparing for the kind of do-or-die hockey he has only watched from home.The opportunity carries significant weight for a player who has never experienced playoff pressure despite emerging as one of the league's most dangerous scorers. Thompson leads Buffalo with 59 points in 57 games this season and ranks tied for eighth in the NHL with 30 goals.Thompson has made the most of his Olympic opportunity with two goals in three preliminary games, tied for second on Team USA with Brock Nelson and Brady Tkachuk. Only captain Auston Matthews has more, with three.His performance against Latvia showcased his elite skill in tight spaces. Thompson took a pass from Jack Eichel on the power play, pulled in the puck and backhanded it high short side with impressive agility for a 6-foot-6 forward.Against Germany, he unleashed a slap shot from the high slot that looked like something from the NHL hardest shot competition. ""You see his bomb,"" Larkin said. ""Like, no one else scores from out there."" Thompson expressed what playing meaningful games means after years of watching playoffs from the sidelines.""This is what you live for, those games that mean something, big challenge, when there's a lot on the line,"" Thompson said. ""I think that's why we all play the game, is to play in those important games and to be a difference-maker.""Thompson and Keller both missed the 4 Nations Face-Off roster last season but earned their Olympic spots through strong play and chemistry developed at USA Hockey's National Development Program and the 2025 World Championship.Coach Mike Sullivan praised Thompson's offensive instincts and ability to handle pressure situations. Larkin compared Keller to Henrik Zetterberg in his ability to control pace with the puck on his stick.The Olympic experience could prove valuable when Thompson finally gets his NHL playoff opportunity. Buffalo currently holds the first wild-card position in the Eastern Conference at 32-18-6, putting the Sabres in position to end their 14-year postseason drought.Team USA plays its quarterfinal on Wednesday at 3:10 p.m. ET with a semifinal berth on the line, giving Thompson his first genuine taste of elimination hockey before the Stanley Cup Playoffs begin in April.",Tage Thompson has never experienced playoff pressure despite emerging as one of the league's most dangerous scorers.

All about Abhishek Sharma’s lonely net session in Ahmedabad

11 - T20 World Cup matches won by India in succession between June 5, 2024-Feb 15, 2026. The last 8 wins have come while defending totals.



43.42 - Suryakumar Yadav’s average while aggregating 608 runs in 20 innings at a strike rate of 154.7, the highest among all batters in T20 World Cup. In the all-time list, his average is the third highest behind Virat Kohli (58.72) and Kevin Pietersen (44.61)

AHMEDABAD: Fresh from a morale-boosting 61-run win over Pakistan in Colombo, India will hope Abhishek Sharma rediscovers form ahead of the Super 8s when they face the Netherlands in their final World Cup league match at the Narendra Modi Stadium on Wednesday. The contest may not test the defending champions fully, but it offers a valuable opportunity to acclimatise to a venue where India will play their opening Super 8 fixture against South Africa on February 22, and potentially the final on March 8.Despite the fixture’s one-sided look on paper, a sizeable turnout is expected at the world’s largest cricket stadium. “We are expecting more than 70,000 spectators. Around 70,000 turned up for the South Africa-New Zealand game here last week,” Gujarat Cricket Association secretary Anil Patel told TOI.With India already through to the next stage — where they will face South Africa (Feb 22, Ahmedabad), Zimbabwe (Feb 26, Chennai) and West Indies (March 1, Kolkata) — staying mentally sharp for what is effectively an inconsequential tie could be the bigger challenge.The spotlight, meanwhile, is on Abhishek. The explosive left-hander arrived at his maiden T20 World Cup with considerable hype after 18 months of destructive opening batting, but has endured a barren run — dismissed for ducks in both matches he has played.In fact, the 25-year-old Punjab and Sunrisers Hyderabad batter has four ducks in his last six innings. He also missed the Namibia game in Delhi due to illness.India’s strong start from Ishan Kishan — the team’s leading run-scorer with 158 runs at a strike rate of 197.50 — has masked Abhishek’s lean patch. But against stronger opponents in the Super 8s, India would want their left-handed aggressor firing on all cylinders. Perhaps a slight recalibration is needed. Yet this is also the kind of game where Abhishek’s high-risk, high-reward approach can flourish. Against Pakistan, he fell to Salman Ali Agha off the fourth ball; against USA, he perished first ball to Ali Khan.The Netherlands clash presents an ideal chance for him to regain rhythm. India’s middle order, too, will look to fine-tune their approach against spin on surfaces offering assistance. Team combination could be another talking point. With three Super 8 matches in nine days, India may consider resting pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah . If so, Mohammed Siraj and Arshdeep Singh could share new-ball duties.On slower tracks, India opted for wrist-spinner Kuldeep Yadav ahead of Arshdeep in Colombo. Whether they stick with Kuldeep remains to be seen. The Netherlands began the tournament brightly, pushing Pakistan to the brink and defeating Namibia by seven wickets. But a 93-run thrashing by USA in Chennai has dented their momentum. To compete against a settled and well-rounded Indian side, the Dutch will need a significant uplift.In their opening match of the T20 World Cup, South Africa made 213 for four against Canada here — the highest score in India so far in the tournament. If India’s bevy of shot-makers get going, they total may be breached.",India face the Netherlands in their final World Cup league match on Wednesday.

Delhi's Vasant Vihar: A name that still carries an emotional weight,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/vasant-vihar-a-name-that-still-carries-an-emotional-weight/articleshow/128492134.cms,"



In the mid-1950s, as independent India’s bureaucracy expanded, central govt employees began forming cooperative housing societies in Delhi, planning communities for post-retirement years. Vasant Vihar was one of them.Located near Chanakyapuri, the colony took shape in the 1970s. Suresh moved in as a 20-year-old young man with his father, who was then working in the defence ministry. “There were only singlestorey houses then — some 250 gaj, some 2,000 gaj. Beautiful parks. It was a completely different world,” he recalls. “Even now, when I say I live in Vasant Vihar, people instantly light up.”The colony’s character had been shaped by its residents — many retired or nearing retirement. They forged a slow lifestyle and strong social bond. The neighbourhood functioned like an extended family — festivals were celebrated together, community functions were common and gardening competitions were big events.Over time, this social cohesion changed. As younger generations entered demanding careers, community participation reduced. “We got tied up with work, so we weren’t as socially involved,” says a second-generation resident.For the elderly, the core spirit hasn’t disappeared. “For me, it’s still the same. There’s no place in Delhi like this,” says another local.Because of the colony’s proximity to the diplomatic enclave, many houses belonging to officers posted outside Delhi were rented out — often to embassies and foreign mission staff — giving the area an early cosmopolitan character. The planning was ahead of its time.Plot sizes varied widely, blocks were designed with nearby schools, and water distribution was planned at a city level. Originally, construction rules required roughly 50% open space and 50% built-up area. Over time, the latter expanded significantly, changing the colony’s character.The green cover, one of the colony’s biggest strengths, bloomed through planting drives led by locals, notes Vivek Tandon, whose father was an original allottee. A census counted nearly 15,000 trees, while large parks acted as shared breathing spaces.Vasant Vihar’s civic infrastructure, however, is under growing pressure. Built near the Ridge, the area has limited room for expansion. Rising population density has strained roads and sewage systems have aged. Markets designed for smaller populations now handle far higher footfall. Encroachment and parking pressure have added to the civic strain.Safety remains a relative strength. While residents acknowledge no area can claim to be crime-free, most say the colony remains safer than most other areas. Accessibility is another plus point. Educational institutions draw younger families, helping maintain generational continuity, while institutions like Vasant Vihar Club continue to act as social bridges.","Located near Chanakyapuri, the colony took shape in the 1970s.

"Our backs are against the wall, says Hardik Singh",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/hockey/top-stories/our-backs-are-against-the-wall-says-hardik-singh/articleshow/128492279.cms,"Indian Men's Hockey Player Hardik Singh

Jay Shah’s 2036 Olympic blueprint for India: '8 Medals won’t cut it'

KOLKATA: Even as the India men’s hockey team put up a terrible performance in the just-concluded Pro League leg in Rourkela, one player who impressed one and all was senior midfielder Hardik Singh He has now been chosen to lead the side during the Hobart leg where the Indian team will play four matches — two each against Australia and Spain — after Harmanpreet Singh was not included in the squad owing to personal reasons. According to sources, Harmanpreet will be missing the games to welcome his second child with wife Amandeep Kaur.For Hardik though, this will be a fresh challenge as the team hopes to turn things around especially after the 0-8 hammering against Argentina.“It’s better that this is happening now, before the World Cup, because we’ll understand how to deal with it,” he said. “Our backs are against the wall, and honestly, we couldn’t have played a worse match than that. But we are committed to working on every area that needs improvement.”And he wants to make it happen step by step.“When you go on a trek, you don’t look at the summit, you focus only on the next step. If we face Argentina again and lose, it won’t be 8-0.It’ll be 2-1, 3-1, or maybe 2-0. That game just spiralled out of control,” added Hardik.While acknowledging these are tough times, Hardik is confident that the team will bounce back from the setback.He emphasised that beyond improving structure and tightening the defence, communication remains one of the most crucial areas the team must address.“There is a lot of diversity in the team, full of different personalities. Some are shy, some are introverts and some are extroverts. So how you play keeping all these in mind makes a huge difference,” said Hardik before adding, “The good thing is everyone’s very comfortable with each other.”Keeping the performance aside, one area that he wants to improve for himself is his sleep cycle.“When you’re playing evening matches, it’s almost impossible to sleep before one or two in the morning because of the adrenaline,” said the two-time Olympic medallist. “And when you’re travelling, you need at least three to four days to adjust to the conditions and different time zones. That makes it even more challenging.”Another challenging aspect for him has been adapting to a different role over the past four years, especially after transitioning into one of the senior members of the squad.“Earlier, I could just focus on my game, but now I have to back the juniors. They listen to me because they know that I have been through all this. So, when tracking back, if the youngsters see that I am also going to defend with them, it gives them confidence,” he said.Defence remains at the core of India’s game.

“I’ll give the deal”: Streamer Rakai shares Deion Sanders college football comment after NFL Pro Bowl celebrity game reaction,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us-streamers/ill-give-the-deal-rakai-shares-deion-sanders-college-football-comment-after-nfl-pro-bowl-celebrity-game-reaction/articleshow/128486170.cms,"“I’ll give the deal”: Rakai shares Deion Sanders college football comment after NFL Pro Bowl celebrity game reaction (Image via Getty)

Deion Sanders responds to Rakai’s college football claim after NFL Pro Bowl celebrity game





Deion Sanders did not stay quiet after streamer Rakai shared a bold story online. The Colorado Buffaloes head coach was part of the NFL Pro Bowl weekend on February 15, where he coached a celebrity flag football game. After the game, Rakai, a 17-year-old YouTuber with nearly 940,000 subscribers, said on his stream that Sanders told him he should leave streaming and come play college football.That claim quickly caught attention. Soon after, a video from Well Off Media showed Sanders reacting when asked about Rakai’s words. Sitting in a barber’s chair, Sanders looked up and said, “Can you get Rakai on the phone so we can discuss this?” He then added, “I love him, I think he played his butt off, he has talent. I don’t know if he’s a college athlete at this point.” So while Deion Sanders praised the teenager’s effort, he also made it clear he was not fully backing the idea of a college offer.During his livestream, Rakai said, “Deion said, I’m not gonna lie Brodie, you wanna put down all that streamer stuff and come play college ball. I’ll give the deal.” Rakai also told his viewers, “I know I’m nice at football but I’m not doing all that.”However, Sanders’ public reaction felt different from that story. In the same Well Off Media video, Sanders later gave a strong message that many fans linked to the situation. He said, “I’m here to tell you, you need to get in the game. What does that mean? You on the sideline. You on the bench. You ain’t even in this thing. You just in the stands talking, talking, talking, running your mouth. But you got so much to say about those that are. Maybe get in the game. What you scared of, what you’re afraid of, but forget your yesterday and don’t fear tomorrow. Ain’t no way you can win if you ain’t in the game, but you always got something to say. I need you to shut up and get in the game.”Sanders did not name Rakai directly in that speech. Still, because of the way the video was edited, many viewers felt the timing was not random.On the field, Rakai actually played well for a celebrity event. He moved quickly, avoided defenders, and made plays on defense. But flag football at a celebrity showcase is very different from Power 4 college football. There is no public record of Rakai’s official height or weight. From the video, he appears smaller than most college prospects, which would matter at that level.At the same event, Sanders also joked about comedian Druski’s performance, saying with a smile, “You gave the other team everything you’ve got.” That moment went viral too, showing Sanders’ mix of humor and honesty.For now, there is no proof that Sanders offered Rakai a real college deal. What is clear is that one livestream comment turned a fun celebrity game into a big online debate between fans of football and streaming.","17-year-old YouTuber Rakai said Sanders told him he should leave streaming and come play college football.

Barack Obama’s daughter Sasha steals the spotlight at NBA All-Star Game 2026: Wears Michelle’s Valentine’s date night earrings to courtside glam,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/barack-obamas-daughter-sasha-steals-the-spotlight-at-nba-all-star-game-2026-wears-michelles-valentines-date-night-earrings-to-courtside-glam/articleshow/128451039.cms,"Sasha Obama’s Rare Public Appearance at the NBA All-Star Game Has Everyone Saying the Same Thing

Obamas ’ Valentine’s Weekend 2026 that continued on-court

‘It’s True But…’: Barack Obama’s First Response After ALIEN Remark Sparks Big Debate | Full Detail

Sasha Obama: From first kid to independent adult in the spotlight

This visual contrast, from the world’s eyes to a more private adulthood, has sparked reflection and commentary about growing up in the public gaze and the transition to private life.

The Obamas as NBA All-Star ambassadors of fashion, culture and family

The NBA All-Star Game has long been about more than basketball. It is a cultural event blending sport, fashion, celebrity culture and entertainment. The presence of the Obamas, widely admired figures in politics, cultural discourse and public life, amplified that mix in a way that resonated across news outlets and social platforms.

At one of basketball’s biggest cultural nights of the year, Michelle Obama showcased her signature blend of elegance and athletic-inspired ease. Opting for a sleek, tailored jacket layered over classic pieces, she struck the perfect balance between polished sophistication and laid-back courtside cool. She delivered a masterclass in the monochrome courtside dressing as she paired the structured black jacket with flowing, wide-leg black trousers that elegantly revealed pointed black leather heeled boots. Her braids were swept into a high ponytail with soft, face-framing tendrils, allowing diamond stud earrings to subtly sparkle under the arena lights. The look felt both accessible and aspirational. Her choice echoed the event’s vibe: celebratory, stylish but never overly formal, anchoring her presence as both a cultural icon and an engaged fan in the stands.

Beside her, Barack Obama kept things relaxed yet refined in smart-casual attire that reflected his long-standing love for the sport. His understated look in clean lines, muted tones and classic layering complemented the evening’s energy: festive but rooted in timeless personal style. Seated beside basketball legend Julius Erving, Barack kept things relaxed yet refined in a navy bomber jacket layered over a black T-shirt and gray trousers. The former president, a longtime basketball enthusiast, also paused to snap photos with NBA superstar Stephen Curry, adding another memorable moment to the family’s stylish All-Star night.

Meanwhile, the couple’s youngest daughter, Sasha Obama, who was seated just behind her parents during the game, embraced a sleek, side-parted blowout with a polished, Gen-Z-meets-Millennial look that contrasted beautifully with her mother’s auburn-tinted braids. Her beauty aesthetic leaned fresh and minimal, complementing a dark gray knit top. However, it was her accessories that subtly stole attention as Sasha appeared to dip into her mom’s jewellery archive, finishing her look with long silver earrings that looked strikingly similar to the pair that Michelle wore during her Valentine’s Day outing with Barack Obama just a day earlier. Sasha radiated fresh, youthful confidence in the minimalist ensemble that felt right at home at a sporting spectacle.

Together, their fashion choices were not just about dressing up for a game; they communicated comfort, unity and elevated everyday style on one of basketball’s brightest stages. While the game itself featured compelling basketball action with stars from the Stars, Stripes and World teams competing in an exhibition format, it was the off-court narrative that captured social media virality.

Barack Obama, known for his love of basketball dating back to his youth, even had a viral courtside moment during the game when he deftly caught a loose ball headed toward their seats before it struck Michelle Obama. That clip quickly circulated online, with fans applauding everything from his reflexes to the wholesome nature of the moment.

The buzz over Obamas and broader All-Star energy

The Obamas were not the only notable attendees. The All-Star Game drew a constellation of celebrities, including Meghan Markle and Prince Harry in their own surprise courtside appearance. This celebrity convergence amplified attention on the event, not just as a sports fixture but as a cultural gathering. Photos and clips from the night were shared widely across Instagram, X (formerly Twitter), TikTok and other platforms, creating a cross-generational buzz that spanned basketball fans, political followers, entertainment audiences and fashion observers alike.

For many, Barack and Michelle Obama evoke a period of American political history tied to hope and change. Seeing them relaxed, affectionate and enjoying an evening together humanises public figures often seen only through the lens of policy or commentary. Unlike some celebrity children who grow up amid constant public exposure, Sasha and her sister Malia have largely been shielded from the media spotlight. This rare glimpse of Sasha enjoying a cultural milestone alongside her parents offered audiences a snapshot of her transition into adulthood.

Basketball and especially NBA All-Star Weekend has grown into a cultural phenomenon beyond sports. It reflects trends in music, fashion, celebrity culture, and media engagement. The Obamas’ presence linked that cultural moment to broader social narratives around family, love and media representation that attracted political followers, family-oriented media and fashion watchers alike.





On February 15, 2026, the Los Angeles Intuit Dome, host to the 75th annual NBA All-Star Game , became the backdrop for one of the most heartwarming celebrity sightings of the year: former US President Barack Obama , former First Lady Michelle Obama and their youngest daughter, Sasha Obama, enjoying a rare family outing together. Their presence turned the star-filled sporting event into a viral moment blending romance, family connection and basketball passion.Just a day before the All-Star Game, the Obamas celebrated Valentine’s Day with a date night that captured public attention. Their transition from a romantic evening to a family-centered sporting event the next day underscored not only their enduring bond as a couple but also their close family ties.Michelle Obama marked the Valentine’s celebration with a heartfelt social media post acknowledging her husband as her “forever dance partner,” offering a candid glimpse into their relationship beyond politics and public service. At the All-Star Game itself, the former first lady posted a photo of the family with the caption: “My favorite teammates on and off the court (sic).”One reason this story gathered so much attention is the rare public appearance of Sasha Obama, the youngest daughter of the former president and first lady. At 24, Sasha is now a graduate of the University of Southern California and has increasingly stepped away from public life. Her courtside appearance alongside her parents at a major sports event was notable precisely because it’s uncommon.Photographs captured Sasha sitting a row behind her parents, stylish and confident, wearing a simple gray ensemble and sharing in the excitement of the game. Observers noted how much she had grown up, a far cry from the young child who entered the White House at age seven during Barack Obama’s presidency.","Barack and Michelle Obama attended the NBA All-Star Game in New York. The Obamas' presence was captured on social media by fans and media. The event was a cultural event blending sport, fashion, celebrity culture and entertainment. It was also one of the biggest cultural nights of the year in the United States.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128452461,imgsize-37602,width-400,resizemode-4/sasha-obamas-rare-public-appearance-at-the-nba-all-star-game-has-everyone-saying-the-same-thing.jpg"
