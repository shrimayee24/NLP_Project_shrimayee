NEW DELHI: Following a rest day in Wijk aan Zee on Monday, the 2025 Tata Steel Chess Tournament returned with a bang as Gukesh Dommaraju of India became the sole leader in the Masters standings after defeating compatriot Leon Luke Mendonca in a 43-move game on Tuesday.Mendonca, who qualified for the Masters this time by winning the Challengers title in the 86th edition of the Tata Steel Chess Tournament last year, had a challenging task ahead, defending with the black pieces against the current World Chess Champion.Almost two months older than Gukesh, Leon has struggled with health issues during this tournament. Earlier, he also visited the doctor prior to his Round 3 match against Pentala Harikrishna.On Tuesday, he chose the Morphy Defense in a game that began with the Ruy López Opening. After Gukesh castled on the fifth move, Mendonca responded aggressively by pushing his pawns in the Columbus Variation.However, Gukesh opted to maintain his piece structure, and the first capture occurred when he sacrificed his opponent's knight with Bxe3 on move 15.The game remained evenly balanced up until move 30. However, on move 31, Mendonca's Bc8 marked his first misstep. Another mistake came on move 32 with Rd8, and a third error, Bd7 on move 39, gave Gukesh a decisive advantage as he used his queen to dominate Mendonca's central position.By the 43rd move, with Gukesh playing Rf2, Mendonca, sensing there was no escape, resigned immediately.This victory propelled Gukesh to claim sole leadership in the Masters standings. At the same time, the previous co-leader Nodirbek Abdusattorov settled for a draw against Fabiano Caruana, and Praggnanandhaa Rameshbabu suffered a heavy defeat to Dutch No. 1 Anish Giri .ALSO READ: India to host FIDE Chess World Cup 2025; Arjuna Awardee 'surprised' at the move In the longest-running game in the Masters section, Praggnanandhaa tried to hold his ground against Giri until the very last moment. However, Giri, determined not to take his foot off the paddle, handed the Indian GM his first loss of the tournament in Wijk aan Zee on Tuesday.The game started with a Catalan Opening, during which Praggnanandhaa initially advanced his rook before retreating and pushing his pawns.His first significant mistake came on move 17 when he pushed his pawn to e5. As pieces, including queens, were traded off and the complexity of the game began to evade, Pragg played Rd8.Since losing his opening game against Gukesh, Giri hadn’t lost another game on home soil. Capitalising on Praggnanandhaa's mistake was no challenge for the Dutchman, who expertly pinned the Indian GM to the left side of the board with some impressive moves.As the game entered the endgame, Praggnanandhaa finally accepted defeat on his 64th move and resigned.ALSO SEE: Tata Steel Chess 2025 Schedule In a morale-boosting result for Indian supporters, Arjun Erigaisi, who had been struggling for form, managed a commendable draw against defending Masters champion Wei Yi of China. Meanwhile, Pentala Harikrishna faced a defeat against Vladimir Fedoseev of Slovenia.In the Challengers section, an all-Indian clash between IM Divya Deshmukh and GM Vaishali Rameshbabu ended in a draw. The 11-year-old Argentine sensation Faustino Oro put up a strong fight against Ediz Gurel of Türkiye but eventually had to resign in the longest game of the day. Meanwhile, the sole leader in the respective section, Thai Dai Van of Czechia, drew with Kazybek Nogerbek of Kazakhstan.","Gukesh Dommaraju of India becomes the sole leader in the Masters standings after defeating compatriot Leon Luke Mendonca in a 43-move game on Tuesday.

Bobby Slowik Controversy: The Real CJ Stroud? Texans Fans Are Second-Guessing His ‘Nice Guy’ Persona After Major Blow-Up with Bobby Slowik,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/the-real-cj-stroud-texans-fans-are-second-guessing-his-nice-guy-persona-after-major-blow-up-with-bobby-slowik/articleshow/117654595.cms,"Tim Warner/Getty Images

The Tension That Started Before the Draft

""He comes into Houston. Bobby Slowik is trying to tell him some stuff and CJ just says, ‘We call this whatever, XY switch, whatever it may be, at Ohio State.' Apparently, maybe it happened a couple of times, and Bobby Slowik just jumped and said, ‘I don’t give a f**k what you called it at Ohio State, this is pro football.' Bobby kinda got in his face about it. I don’t know if Bobby was testing him, I don’t know what the deal was. But CJ jumped up and got back in his face. It was very contentious and had to be broken up. Then CJ went to his next draft meeting and they said we asked CJ how his last visit went and he said it went terrible.""

Fans React: Is Stroud Really the Humble Star We Think He Is?

“I don't believe this story. Nothing about it makes any sense. Nothing said in this story matches up to what you can witness. Stroud had no reason to talk up Kevin Wilson after the Peach Bowl, but did. It's just all over the place.”

Stroud and the Texans Look Ahead: A New Offensive Coordinator

The Future of Stroud and the Texans

When it comes to CJ Stroud, fans have always seen him as the humble, cool-headed quarterback for the Houston Texans . But recent rumors about a fiery altercation with former offensive coordinator Bobby Slowik have some questioning whether that ""nice guy"" persona is all cracked up.The drama between Stroud and Slowik reportedly started long before their actual working relationship began. According to ESPN 97.5 radio host Lance Zierlein, Stroud and Slowik got into a heated argument during one of Stroud’s pre-draft meetings with the Texans.Apparently, Stroud wasn’t too keen on the coaching approach, referencing his time at Ohio State. When Slowik didn’t appreciate it, things quickly escalated. Zierlein explained:Naturally, fans have flocked to social media to discuss the situation. Some are defending Stroud, calling the story a fabricated rumor, while others are starting to question his character.One fan said,However, others are beginning to see how this tension could explain a lot about Stroud’s rookie year success, followed by the Texans’ underwhelming offensive performance in the sophomore season.Despite this drama, Stroud and the Texans were still able to secure a playoff spot in his first year. But with a less-than-ideal second season, Houston has made the decision to fire Slowik and is now searching for a new offensive mind.Candidates like former Eagles coach Chip Kelly and Syracuse's Jeff Nixon have already been mentioned. It remains to be seen who’ll be tapped to lead Stroud and the Texans’ offense in the 2025 season, but fans are hopeful for a much-needed offensive boost.While Stroud’s altercation with Slowik may have raised eyebrows, it’s clear that the quarterback's journey is far from over. With a new offensive coordinator on the horizon, Stroud’s future with the Texans remains promising—though fans may be wondering if the “nice guy” image was just a facade after all.Also read - Travis Kelce Couldn’t Answer This Taylor Swift Trivia in a Hilarious Moment on ‘Are You Smarter Than a Celebrity?’","Houston Texans quarterback CJ Stroud reportedly got into a heated argument with former offensive coordinator Bobby Slowik.

, the rising star for the, is, leaving a significant gap in the team's lineup. The Thunder, fresh off a two-day rest, are preparing for a critical matchup against the Golden State Warriors on January 29, 2025, but Holmgren’s absence looms large.Chet Holmgren, who has been a key player for the Oklahoma City Thunder this season, suffered a hip fracture earlier in the campaign, and his recovery timeline has led to his continued absence. His injury not only affects the Thunder’s frontcourt depth but also takes away a significant defensive presence and scoring ability. While the Thunder have managed to stay atop the Western Conference standings with a 37-8 record, Holmgren’s absence could eventually catch up with them, especially as the playoffs approach.Head coach Mark Daigneault will need to rely more heavily on players like Jalen Williams and Isaiah Hartenstein to fill the void left by Holmgren. Williams, who has impressed in recent games, showed promise in the Oklahoma City Thunder ’s last encounter with the Warriors, posting 13 points, six rebounds, and seven assists in just 16 minutes of action before exiting with an injury. Hartenstein has also been performing well in the frontcourt, contributing heavily in both offense and defense.Despite Chet Holmgren ’s injury, the Thunder have maintained a solid position in the standings, holding a 5.5-game lead over the second-place team in the West. However, with key matchups ahead, particularly against teams like the Warriors, the Thunder’s roster depth will be tested. The Warriors are fighting for a playoff spot and will be looking to take advantage of OKC's shorthanded lineup. The absence of Chet Holmgren adds to the challenges facing the Thunder, but the team’s overall talent, led by MVP candidate Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, should help them weather the storm.As of now, Holmgren’s injury status remains uncertain, and his potential return could be a game-changer for Oklahoma City. His ability to stretch the floor, protect the rim, and contribute offensively makes him a vital part of the Thunder's future.

Bregman Wants More, Astros Say 'No Thanks' – Is This the End of the Line?



The Latest on Alex Bregman and Ryan Pressly | Chandler Rome

Well, folks, Houston's baseball anthem might soon play without a player who was very significant for their team, which was their star in the mix. All-Star selections and a World Series title were not enough to guarantee the future of Alex Bregman with the Astros, as the situation became fuzzy quite suddenly. That’s right. Despite having been welcomed with a wow six-year, $156 million offer, the third baseman would not change his mind, and thus the Astros front office found itself suddenly on the ropes.And if you thought that was dramatic, let’s talk about Jose Altuve—Bregman’s loyal teammate and all-around baseball buddy. In an emotional plea, Altuve was keen to sacrifice his place to facilitate his friend’s return to the team, which had undoubtedly never been seen before. Sacrificing one’s comfort to help someone. Have you ever seen that? A plot twist was a mainstay back in the days of a baseball soap opera when Bregman’s demands turned out to be not quite at the level of teamwork the Astros prefer.The issue? It’s not about love, folks. It’s about the money. Even though most people would consider $156 million a very high amount of money, Bregman believes he is worth more than that. And, in fact, why could you? A resume that is composed of an All-Star career, a World Series ring, and consistent, high-end play just cannot be undervalued. But the Houston Astros, having a reputation for spotting talents in their locality and engaging, if you will, small-corporation-like tactics even in the cases they have to distribute huge contracts, are not exactly rolling out a red carpet for Mr. Bregman.Furthermore, it is rumored the Astros are planning to part ways with their third baseman to make the situation even more intriguing. Yes, they have certainly begun to move on, planning a life after Bregman, and definitely, it’s not an easy job. Whether the Astros have to find a replacement for his bat or his leadership, there will undoubtedly be one very large hole in their lineup if he goes.Still, the human aspect of what occurred should not be overlooked. It is not that Alex Bregman is merely a player on the team; he is a master key to the Astros organizational structure, both in the field and off the field. And his leadership, energy, and commitment to the team have commanded a place in the hearts of these guys. Without him, there would be no cheer in the first column; it’d be a hole that would be left, and that would be impossible for any negotiation in the world to fall through.What does that mean? Well, that leaves us with an enormous cloud of fog all over. Will the Astros and Bregman come to a mutual understanding to ensure the stability of their future together? Or are we to expect that Houston's cherished third baseman will seek opportunities with other clubs after an emotional and financial divorce from the team? So if you are planning to stay with us for a while, you should know what will happen, man. This is a longer story, and as we all know, baseball fans—be ready for some surprises.One thing to keep in mind is that Bregman has all the power.","Alex Bregman was offered a six-year, $156 million contract by the Houston Astros. The third baseman refused to sign the contract, saying he was worth more. Jose Altuve made an emotional plea to his teammate to get Breg man to sign.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117642810,imgsize-8024,width-400,resizemode-4/117642810.jpg"
Travis Kelce’s ex Kayla Nicole shares surprising one-word reaction to Chiefs vs. Eagles Super Bowl,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/travis-kelces-ex-kayla-nicole-shares-surprising-one-word-reaction-to-chiefs-vs-eagles-super-bowl/articleshow/117617122.cms,"Credit: Kayla Nicole/IG

Kayla Nicole’s one-word take on Super Bowl 2025 after Chiefs’ victory over Bills



The much-anticipated Super Bowl rematch between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles is set for February 9. Despite a quieter postseason from Travis Kelce , the Chiefs secured their third consecutive AFC title with a 32-29 win over the Buffalo Bills. Earlier, the Eagles dominated the Washington Commanders 55-23 with seven rushing touchdowns. Kayla Nicole , Travis Kelce’s ex-girlfriend, shared her opinion about the upcoming showdown.Super Bowl 2025 is set to deliver one of the most anticipated matchups in NFL history, with the Kansas City Chiefs facing the Philadelphia Eagles. This match promises to be a battle of two of the league's most talented teams, both armed with star power.Kayla Nicole, a former partner of Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, previously expressed her reluctance to see Kansas City make a third consecutive Super Bowl appearance. However, after the Chiefs triumphed over the Buffalo Bills in the AFC Championship, punching their ticket to Super Bowl 2025, Nicole seemed to shift gears.“Tough!” Kayla wrote over a graphic showing Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes and Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts. She followed it up with a more optimistic sentiment, acknowledging the significance of the game. “It will be a storybook ending either way on Feb 9th,” she said. “And as a fan of the game, that’s really all you can ask for.”Kayla also had words of praise for the Eagles, particularly their performance in the NFC Championship against the San Francisco 49ers. After initially criticizing their less-than-impressive 28-22 victory over the Rams, Kayla lauded the Eagles for their dominant 55-23 win. ""7 rushing TDs,"" Kayla wrote, referring to Philadelphia tying an NFL playoff record. ""Hurts 256 passing YDs, Barkley 118 rushing YDs, 55 pts, most in championship game history. Complete play elevation and domination from last week. Job. Well. DONE.""The Chiefs, led by Mahomes, are chasing a historic third consecutive championship. Mahomes, having recently surpassed Joe Montana for the second-most playoff wins by a quarterback, is aiming to cement his legacy alongside NFL legends like Tom Brady. A win would make him just the third player in NFL history to win multiple MVPs and four championships, joining Brady and Montana in this exclusive club.On the other side, the Eagles bring their own formidable talents to the table. Quarterback Jalen Hurts, already known for his dual-threat ability, has been instrumental in Philadelphia's postseason success. In the NFC Championship, Hurts ran for three touchdowns, leading the Eagles to their second Super Bowl appearance in three years. Running back Saquon Barkley has also been a standout, contributing heavily to the offense with 118 rushing yards in the NFC Championship.The stats tell a compelling story. According to PFN’s Playoff Predictor, the Eagles hold a slight edge with a 52.8% chance of victory. Their offense has been firing on all cylinders, scoring 166 points over the past five games, while their defense has forced 19 turnovers in their last six outings.Also Read: ""Bills Mafia is the best fanbase in the world"": Josh Allen's emotional reaction after another crushing defeat to Patrick Mahomes and Kansas City Chiefs Both teams bring high-level playmaking, historic quests, and a wealth of talent, making Super Bowl 59, one for the ages.

The match promises high-intensity action, but both teams are dealing with injuries heading into this game. While the Knicks have several players on their injury report, the Nuggets' injury concerns center around key players like Nikola Jokic. Nikola Jokic is the reigning NBA MVP and one of the most impactful players in the league and is a crucial part of Denver's lineup. Jokic has been performing at an elite level, averaging 24.5 points, 11.3 rebounds, and 9.1 assists in his last 20 games. However, as of January 29, Jokic’s status is being closely monitored due to a recent injury.

Jokic’s contribution is critical to the Nuggets’ success, and his ability to dominate in both scoring and playmaking has been a key factor in Denver’s offensive prowess.Aside from Jokic, the Nuggets are dealing with injuries to Vlatko Cancar and DaRon Holmes. Cancar is out due to a knee injury, and Holmes has been ruled out for the season following an Achilles injury. These injuries limit the Denver Nuggets ' depth, but the team still boasts significant talent, including Jamal Murray , Michael Porter Jr., and Russell Westbrook.The New York Knicks have their own injury concerns heading into this matchup.

Virat Kohli trains at Kotla ahead of Ranji Trophy return

Details from Virat Kohli's training session with Delhi Ranji Team at Feroz Shah Kotla

Vikas Mishra:

Mahesh Bhati

(Has tracked Kohli since age-group days):

NEW DELHI: There’s a buzz in the air at Delhi’s Arun Jaitley Stadium. The city is gripped by Virat Kohli mania as the Indian batting maestro makes his much-awaited return to domestic cricket after over 12 years. Kohli last featured in the Ranji Trophy in November 2012. For the fans, it’s a celebration of Kohli’s comeback, but for Kohli himself, it feels like a homecoming.TimesofIndia.com caught up with some of Kohli’s former Delhi teammates who were part of the squad during his last Ranji Trophy appearance in 2012 against Uttar Pradesh, reliving cherished memories of that game. Here's what they remember from that game:""The match was in Ghaziabad and we lost that match. I remember we lost Unmukt early but Kohli resurrected the innings and had a decent partnership with Gambhir. He’s not just a player but a role model in the game. Youngsters will learn so much from him in this match. Back then, he was a young cricketer learning from seniors, and now he returns as a senior himself, ready to guide the juniors.""I remember playing alongside Virat, Ishant Sharma, Yogesh Nagar, and Manan Sharma, under the mentorship of legends like Ashish Nehra, Virender Sehwag, and Gautam Gambhir. We learned a lot from them. This Delhi team has a significant advantage with Virat in the squad. They should make the most of his experience and knowledge.""""It was a big match. Delhi were playing UP. We were playing with the packed side. Virat (Kohli) was there, Viru bhai (Virender Sehwag) was there. Shikhar (Dhawan) wasn't there. Ashish Nehra was there. Gautam Gambir was also there. We had a bright side. The big crowds were there. But, we lost that game.""Bhuvi (Bhuvneshwar Kumar) got me out (for a duck) in the second innings. But with all international players playing, there was a very different feel to it. Obviously that time also, he (Kohli) was the one you looked up to. We were very close. Big names were there. You look up to these guys, and I've closely followed his journey even before that.""""He was still a hero to all of us. He was very aggressive on the field. A Delhi boy like, you know, things you associate with Delhi cricket. He was very chilled inside the dressing room. I also remember once we finished that match, I, Virat and Suresh Raina had go to Mumbai. We had that Pepsi shoot. So, all of us finished the game and the next day, we had to fly to Mumbai for that.""“Virat’s energy back then was top-class, and it’s the same now. He hasn’t changed. He still carries that aura and passion for the game. I remember how frustrated and angry he would get whenever he got out—he hated losing his wicket. Virat has always been about scoring big for the team, never chasing personal milestones. For him, it has always been team first.""Even back then, he was a two-time World Cup winner—the 2008 U19 World Cup and the 2011 ODI World Cup—but he was still yaaron ka yaar, someone who was always there for his friends. This Delhi team is fortunate to have him. They can learn a lot from a player of his stature.""“Virat has always been a quick learner. His last Ranji game was in 2012, so returning after more than a decade is remarkable. There isn’t a single player in the current squad from his time, making everyone in the team junior to him. He’s unfamiliar with most players except a few like Navdeep Saini and Ayush Badoni, whom he knows from the IPL.""When he realised he didn’t know the players well, he decided not to lead the side. Instead, he handed over the captaincy to Ayush Badoni. That shows his humility. Virat sat with the team, spoke to the players, and motivated them, saying, ‘Abey, Delhi ke cricketers ho, tagda hoke khelo, jeet ke khatam karo.’ His presence has energised the squad. The players’ body language is entirely different with him around,” Bhati said.All eyes will be on the fixture in New Delhi which starts on January 30. While Delhi are out of the qualification race, a lot of former stalwarts from the state will be glued to action because their very own ""Cheeku"" will be donning the DDCA jersey after a long time.",Virat Kohli makes his much-awaited return to domestic cricket after over 12 years. Kohli last featured in the Ranji Trophy in November 2012. Former Delhi teammates who were part of the squad during that game recall memories of that game.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117685774,imgsize-45244,width-400,resizemode-4/117685774.jpg"

Virat Kohli trains at Kotla ahead of Ranji Trophy return

Details from Virat Kohli's training session with Delhi Ranji Team at Feroz Shah Kotla

NEW DELHI: Amidst the cheering crowd at the Arun Jaitley Stadium, India superstar Virat Kohli, dressed in shorts, a T-shirt, and a sweater bearing the Delhi District Cricket Association logo, stepped out of the dressing room. The Delhi players were waiting for him to join in the light football session.""Chalo bey, shuru karo,"" Virat said, marking his return to the Ranji Trophy after 12 years. His last appearance for Delhi was against Uttar Pradesh in 2012. For Kohli, it isn't just a comeback — it is a homecoming.He shared moments of laughter, exchanged high-fives, draped his arm over teammates’ shoulders, and offered words of encouragement to a young Delhi squad.After a while, he returned to the dressing room and came out pulling his cricket kit.Delhi team manager Mahesh Bhati , who had coached Kohli during his Under-17 and Under-19 days, noticed him and signalled to some of the young boys to help the veteran batter with his kit.However, Kohli, with a smile, declined the offer. He carried his own gear and made his way toward the nets.Also See: Champions Trophy 2025 ""He is still the same. He is the same Virat for everyone,"" Bhati told TimesofIndia.com in an exclusive interview.""In fact, on the first day of the training session, he went inside the dressing room and carried his own kit bag. Then, he practiced the entire day and carried his kit bag back to the dressing room.I said, 'Virat, teri help kara dete hain [""Virat, let us help you].' He replied, 'Bhaia, kya baat kar rahe ho? Mere khelne ka samaan hai, mai khud leke jaunga [""Bhaia, what are you saying? It's my playing gear, I'll carry it myself]'. He carried the kit bag on his shoulders and went inside the dressing room,"" Bhati said.Before getting into an intense practice session, Kohli, as he unpacked his cricket gear and prepared, engaged in a thoughtful conversation with Bhati.The two were seen sharing laughs during their chat.""I was the coach when Virat played Under-19. He played under my coaching only. We have shared a great bond since the beginning. I also love cracking jokes, and so does he. So, we were recalling old memories and bursting into laughter. The first thing he asked was, 'Bhaia, matting pe ab ladke nahi khelte kya? [Bhaia, don't boys play on matting anymore?]' I said, 'Pagal ho gaya hai tu! Matting kaha hai ab? Ab kahin Delhi mein matting nahi milegi [Where is matting now? You won’t find matting anywhere in Delhi anymore].""Also See: Champions Trophy Schedule 2025 ""He said he used to play cut shots and pull shots on matting. He added, 'Bhaia, maza bada aata tha pull marne mein, awaaz sahi aati thi.'"" [Bhaia, hitting pull shots was so much fun; the sound was just perfect]""Whichever player has played on matting, you will see them play cut and pull shots elegantly, freely, and with confidence. The old players, including Virat, do that really well. It’s because of the cricket they played on matting.""""Virat also recalled the moments when he used to play on grounds with uneven surfaces and long grass. Back then, matting used to serve as the pitch for them. Bouncers, cuts, pulls, and short-pitched deliveries were the scenes cricketers loved, and Virat spoke about all of that.""""Maine kaha, 'Matting ki story khatam ho gayi hai, cricket bahut change ho gayi hai [The matting story is over; cricket has changed a lot]' He said, 'Cricket ka maza usi mein tha [The fun of cricket was in that].""""Virat also shared an incident when he and another batter were playing on matting with thick grass all around. He hit a shot and assumed it was a boundary, but when they came together for a fist bump, the fielder ran them out,"" Bhati shared.The Ranji Trophy clash between Delhi and Railways is set for January 30 at Kohli's home ground of the Arun Jaitley Stadium. Such is the excitement for it, the match will be broadcast live on JioCinema. On the ground, though, Kohli’s return to domestic cricket after more than a decade is sure to be a memorable moment for those who will make the journey to Old Delhi.",Virat Kohli returns to the Ranji Trophy after 12 years.

3) Dominant impact before retirement match



2) More Starpower added to the Rumble



1) Get rumoured World Championship at WrestleMania



Goldberg can be an excellent addition to the already star-studded Men’s Royal Rumble match set to take place at the name-sake event in Indianapolis.WWE Royal Rumble 2025 is rapidly approaching and is set to take over Lucas Oil Stadium on February 1 in Indianapolis, Indiana. The event will feature some of the biggest WWE superstars of all time, such as Roman Reigns, CM Punk, Rey Mysterio, Seth Rollins, Jey Uso, and, most of all, John Cena, who will be competing in his last Rumble event.Among these illustrious names, one more that can possibly join them in the Men’s Rumble match is Goldberg. The WCW legend had made an appearance in WWE after a long time at the Bad Blood Premium Live Event. Following that, he announced his retirement match to take place in 2025. With Goldberg reaching the end of his in-ring days, here are the three reasons that make him a possibility to appear in the Men’s Royal Rumble match:Goldberg is always known for being one of the most dominant in-ring competitors in the history of wrestling despite questionable in-ring acumen. With the former WWE Universal Champion getting ready for retirement in 2025, the Royal Rumble match could be his opportunity to dust off the ring rust as he has not competed inside the squared circle for a long time. Moreover, this match could also help Goldberg re-establish his dominating persona in front of the WWE Universe again.As announced, this year’s Men’s Royal Rumble match is set to be one of the most star-studded bouts of all time. It will feature top names like John Cena, Roman Reigns, Rey Mysterio, Jey Uso, Seth Rollins and CM Punk among the announced participants. Goldberg joining the Rumble match will only add more star power to the mix, as he is still one of the most legendary names and a WWE Hall of Famer in his own right, making i,t perhaps, one of the greatest Rumble matches of all time.Ever since Goldberg made his return to WWE at Bad Blood and announced retirement in 2025, there have been rumours of a potential match between Goldberg and Gunther. The belief became stronger when the two were involved in a heated confrontation at WWE Bad Blood PLE. Therefore, the Royal Rumble match could be Goldberg’s ticket to go to WrestleMania 41 and challenge Gunther for the World Heavyweight Championship at The Show of Shows this year.Also read: 3 NXT Female Superstars Who Deserve to Compete in the 2025 Women's Royal Rumble Match","WWE Royal Rumble 2025 is set to take over Lucas Oil Stadium on February 1 in Indianapolis, Indiana.

Semis line up: Shrachi Rarh Bengal Tigers vs Tamil Nadu Dragons, Soorma Hockey Club vs Hyderabad Toofans

ROURKELA: UP Rudras gave their all but couldn’t earn a win in regulation time and it was Tamil Nadu Dragons who qualified for the semifinals of Hockey India League at Birsa Munda Hockey Stadium here on Wednesday.Dragons needed just a point to make it to the top four and they were able to get that after the match finished 2-2 in regular time. Later Rudras won the shootouts 3-2 in sudden death, but it didn’t matter.Meanwhile, Soorma Hockey Club grabbed a 3-0 shootout win against Shrachi Rarh Bengal Tigers in the first match of the day after it finished 1-1 in regulation time.As a result, the Bengal Tigers finished on top of the table with 19 points followed by Soorma, who also have 19 points but a lesser number of wins. Toofans and Dragons both have 18 points, but Toofans finished third thanks to their better goal difference.Earlier in the day, Gurjant Singh put Soorma ahead in the 10th minute through a field goal but with just four minutes left for the final hooter to go, Jugraj Singh equalized from the penalty corner to take the game into the shootouts. Vincent Vanasch then helped Soorma win in shootouts.Later in the day, Rudras had a brilliant start to the game as Sudeep Chirmako put them in the lead in the ninth minute. Lalit Kumar Upadhyay then doubled it at the stroke of the end of first quarter after Rudras won their first PC of the match.As the match progressed Dragons tried their best to get back into the game, but Rudras did well to keep them at bay. Their perseverance finally paid off though as Jip Janssen converted their first PC two minutes into the third quarter.Requiring only a draw to make the top-four, Dragons went all out after that, but Rudras goalkeeper James Mazarelo made some brilliant saves to keep Rudras in the match. However, his walls were finally breached when Thomas Sorsby deflected in Blake Govers’ shot from their fifth PC in the 53rd minute.",Tamil Nadu Dragons qualify for semifinals of Hockey India League.

Mizoram also impressed in the sub-junior women's national championship later in the year, making it to the semifinals and eventually finishing fourth.In a region where football remains the first love among most people, this was certainly quite a feat. It's just the start, though.

Former India captain Sushila Chanu believes it's going to have a huge impact in the coming days.""It's a great feeling and a huge opportunity for all the players to be part of this tournament. Most importantly, when today's generation sees us perform here, they will be inspired to take up the game,"" said Chanu, who played for Shrachi Rarh Bengal Tigers in WHIL.Her Bengal Tigers and India teammate Lalremsiami , who hails from Mizoram, believes their good showing will help in better infrastructure coming up in the state, something that is still missing.""There are several good players in Mizoram but it's not easy for them since good facilities aren't yet available. Hopefully, it will come up in the coming days,"" said Lalremsiami.Speaking of talent, one of the young Mizoram players who did well over the past two weeks of WHIL was Bengal Tigers' Lalrinpuii . She was also part of the Junior Asia Cup squad and scored a goal against Thailand. Coming from a family of footballers, she took up hockey in the hope of getting a job to support her family.Marina Lalramnghaki , also from Mizoram, was over the moon when she was picked in the auctions by Bengal Tigers for Rs.10 lakh.

"I hate it when told ISL must finish before IPL starts, says Marquez",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/i-hate-it-when-told-isl-must-finish-before-ipl-starts-says-marquez/articleshow/117717230.cms,"Indian national football team boss insists there's space for more than 1 sport in a nation of 1.4bn

Edited excerpts:

How do you do this balancing act of coaching club and country?

Everyone says the mentality of an Indian footballer is not the same as in other countries. Do you agree?

It's been five years for you in India, the longest time you have spent outside your home country. What has your experience been like?

Now that you are the coach of the national team, what changes do you want to implement?

In India, cricket is a religion, so how do you see football cross that barrier?

Manolo Marquez is the first foreigner to take up the dual role of coaching an Indian football club, FC Goa, and the national team. In a free-wheeling chat during Townhall With The Times of India, the Indian football team coach opens up on his first impressions of the country, adapting to the ""Indian way"" of getting things done, while discussing the way forward for the beautiful game.I didn't expect to share both jobs. The beginning was more difficult because the national team had games in Sept, Oct and Nov and FC Goa had a bad start. People talk, but I always say all this noise (and criticism) is why I get paid. About the dual role, it's not normal, but it's not the first time either.I always joke that one day I will write a book on India and the title will be 'The Indian Mentality'. There is a lot of talent, but they don't know how to show this talent. There is no consistency (in performances).When I arrived here, the players that were very good in the first season disappeared in the second. Players who were very bad in the previous season, did very good in the next. You need consistency. I miss this in Indian football.Looking at the chaos (during the Covid-19 pandemic) on the first day I arrived in Mumbai, I asked myself, 'what are you doing here?' Then I landed in Goa (to be inside the biosecure bubble for ISL ), got inside the car and was astonished with the driving. I told the driver, 'Wow, you can be an incredible winger, you surpassed cars, dogs, cows, people.' It was completely crazy. I wanted to leave after 10 minutes. It's my fifth season now. India is an incredible country.The national team, at this moment, is less important. You need to focus on the grassroots. There is Vision 2047 (by the AIFF ), but if you don't start work immediately (on the grassroots), it will be Vision 2097. You need to do something as soon as possible because the talent is there. If you see U-13, U-15, U-17 players in FC Goa, maybe you will be surprised. There are better, or the same, players here like in Spain.But the (development) process is completely different. Here the focus is on studies, and they cannot attend (regular) training sessions because they have exams constantly. Then there are (travel) distances. When people ask me when India will play at the World Cup, I tell them this is the last question (anyone should be asking). You need to start from the bottom.In my opinion, football will never surpass cricket in India. Never. But in a country of 1.4 billion, there is space for more than one sport. What I do hate is when I am told that ISL must finish before IPL starts. I know a million more people will watch IPL cricket than ISL, but that's okay, if (football) is the second sport. Keep going, don't change fixtures. This is something India needs to improve. Maybe I am from another culture, another mentality. Here, everything is organised at the last moment, and then it's changed. You need a proper schedule. Now I have learnt a lot to improvise. Do it the Indian way.","Manolo Marquez is the first foreigner to take up the dual role of coaching an Indian football club, FC Goa, and the national team.

Career and personal life

Bonnie Blue , a 25-year-old OnlyFans creator from Derbyshire , claims to have set a world record by having sex with 1,057 men in 12 hours, reports Daily Mail.The event took place in London, allegedly surpassing the previous record of 919 men in 24 hours set by adult actress Lisa Sparks in 2004, with Bonnie claiming she ""bedded 1,057 in 12 hours.""In a video shared on TikTok, Bonnie thanked those who participated, saying, “Thank you to all the barely legal, barely breathing and the husbands.”She added that her skin looked better after the event and described the experience: “The room was absolutely full. We did groups of five, like one after the other. It was a rotating circle.”Her PR team confirmed the tally, stating, “She slept with 1,057 people. As she hit 1,000, there were still 57 left in the queue who Bonnie wanted to pleasure before ending the 12-hour day.” Calculations suggest she averaged 41 seconds per partner.The stunt sparked outrage online, with comments such as “How embarrassing” and “Sad that men would want to do that too—all for fame and money.” Bonnie is no stranger to controversy, having previously defended her claims of sleeping with “barely legal” 18-year-olds and encouraging men to cheat on their wives.Bonnie's real name is Tia Billinger , who says she earns up to £750,000 a month from her OnlyFans content. Despite criticism, she insists her work is educational. “I can’t think of one situation where an 18-year-old has had sex where they’ve had to bring a passport, sign consent forms, and do a breathalyser,” she said on ITV’s This Morning.She also addressed criticism for sleeping with married men, arguing, “If wives aren’t going to pleasure husbands, let them go elsewhere. It’s just an act; the husbands mean nothing to me.”Bonnie transitioned to sex work after moving to Australia in 2022 with her now ex-husband, Oliver Davidson. Formerly a recruitment professional, she launched her career as a cam girl and later joined OnlyFans.She claims her family now supports her career, with her mother even assisting her business by booking appointments and handing out condoms for marketing. “It’s changed their life completely for the better,” she said.Bonnie defended her actions, stating, “These 18-year-olds can go to the army, they can drive, they can drink… If they want to use their own bodies to come and sleep with me, that is their decision.”","Bonnie Blue, 25, claims to have had sex with 1,057 men in 12 hours.

Andy Reid Reveals What He Truly Loves About Travis Kelce



Travis Kelce is Still Clutch in the Playoffs, No Signs of Slowing Down



What’s Next for Travis Kelce? Retirement or Another Run?



The Kansas City Chiefs are set for another shot at Super Bowl glory as they prepare to take on the Philadelphia Eagles in a highly anticipated rematch of Super Bowl 57. That game saw the Chiefs edge out the Eagles 38-35 in a thrilling contest, and this time, the stakes are even higher. At the center of it all is Travis Kelce , the legendary tight end whose contributions have been instrumental in Kansas City’s continued dominance.Now in his 12th season, Travis Kelce has firmly established himself as one of the greatest to ever play the tight end position. His experience has allowed him to not only remain a key player but also mentor younger teammates, a trait that has earned him praise from head coach Andy Reid. Having been with Kelce since his rookie season in 2013, Reid has seen firsthand the unwavering commitment that has made the 35-year-old a mainstay in Kansas City’s offense.""He's still a really good football player,"" Reid stated on The Pat McAfee Show. ""He keeps himself in great shape, never wants to miss a rep in practice, hates coming out of the game—I mean, absolutely hates coming out of the game. I love that part of him.""“He’s a great player. He’s got guys around him that are a little bit healthier, so all of these defensive coordinators, their whole focus isn’t just on Trav and stopping Trav, and so, it frees him up a little bit,” Reid said. “He hasn’t changed anything from before. He can still do all the same things. If he’s got a couple of guys on him, then you go a different direction and have to work another area.”Despite speculation that Kelce’s performance has declined over the past couple of seasons, Reid insists that nothing has changed about his work ethic or impact. While opposing defenses have increasingly focused their attention on shutting him down, he continues to find ways to contribute when it matters most.The conversation around Kelce’s supposed decline largely stems from the fact that his regular-season numbers have dipped compared to his prime years. After recording seven consecutive 1,000-yard seasons from 2016 to 2022—an NFL record for a tight end—he failed to reach that mark in the last two seasons. Additionally, his three touchdown receptions in the 2023 regular season were a career-low.Yet, when the postseason arrives, Kelce has proven time and time again why he remains one of the most dangerous weapons in the league. In the divisional round against the Houston Texans, he delivered a vintage performance with seven receptions for 117 yards and a touchdown. Historically, his playoff numbers have been even more impressive than his regular-season stats, as seen last year when his per-game average jumped from 66 to 89 yards in the playoffs.When asked about the perception that he is slowing down, Kelce responded bluntly, ""No.""""I laugh at it,"" he added. ""It's fun. As long as I'm going out there and we're winning, that's all that matters.""While Kelce remains a force on the field, there is growing speculation about whether he will continue his career beyond this season. He has hinted at contemplating retirement but has yet to make any definitive decisions. However, with his passion for the game still evident and his ability to dominate in critical moments, it wouldn’t be surprising to see him return for another season.Also Read: Inside Taylor Swift’s postgame chat with Travis Kelce—Mics capture their unfiltered Super Bowl joy Regardless of what the future holds, one thing is certain: Travis Kelce is still a game-changer, and as long as he’s on the field, the Chiefs remain a serious threat to win it all.",Andy Reid says Travis Kelce keeps himself in great shape and hates coming out of the game. Kelce's regular-season numbers have dipped compared to his prime years. He has hinted at contemplating retirement but has yet to make any definitive decisions.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117717653,imgsize-48716,width-400,resizemode-4/117717653.jpg"

MI Cape Town 's (MICT) all-round display on Wednesday evening in Newlands booked their maiden appearance in the SA20 Playoffs with a dominant 10-wicket win over Sunrisers Eastern Cape (SEC).After all-rounder Corbin Bosch (4 for 19) and Kagiso Rabada (2 for 14) combined to bowl out SEC for just 107, Ryan Rickelton smashed a half-century (59* off 36 balls) and took the team home alongside fellow opener Rassie van der Dussen (48* off 30) for a commanding victory without losing a wicket.The win confirmed MICT a spot in Qualifier 1 against current table-toppers Paarl Royals in Gqeberha on February 4, with the winner of the match entering the final.MICT's brilliant bowling display was aided by some excellent catching from Dewald Brevis, Bosch and Reeza Hendricks -- highlighted by Brevis's one-handed screamer at the edge of the boundary.Bedingham's determined effort of a run-a-ball 45 kept the Sunrisers in contention, but he lacked adequate backing from his partners at the opposite end.In the end, Andile Simelane's 21 runs off 22 balls helped to push the SEC total past the hundred-run mark.The Sunrisers now face a must-win game against Paarl Royals on Saturday to secure a place in the playoffs.""(Fielding) is very important especially in this format...I feel the effort you put in fielding is very important. It put us ahead in the game...It was important to finish with the bonus point and in top two,"" said MICT captain Rashid Khan after the match.","MI Cape Town (MICT) booked their maiden appearance in the SA20 Playoffs with a dominant 10-wicket win over Sunrisers Eastern Cape (SEC) The win confirmed MICT a spot in Qualifier 1 against current table-toppers Paarl Royals in Gqeberha on February 4, with the winner of the match entering the final.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117713573,imgsize-57116,width-400,resizemode-4/117713573.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Following one of the most highly anticipated clashes of Round 10, India’s Gukesh Dommaraju maintained his lead at the top of the Masters leaderboard at the 2025 Tata Steel Chess Tournament , defeating Dutchman Max Warmerdam on his home soil in Wijk aan Zee on Wednesday.Defending with the black pieces, Gukesh responded to the King’s Pawn Opening with an out-of-the-box Pirc Defense. Showing early aggression, the youngest-ever World Chess Champion captured Warmerdam’s first piece, the Queen’s Pawn, with Cxd4.With the Chennai-born grandmaster maintaining his aggressive stance, continued pressure from his pieces ultimately provoked a blunder from the 24-year-old Dutchman.As Gukesh captured Warmerdam’s rook with Qxc8 on move 27, Warmerdam, in a desperate attempt to attack Gukesh’s queen, played Rc1.The advantage was now entirely in Gukesh’s hands, and he capitalised immediately, playing Nxg3 on move 30. With no escape from the mounting pressure, Warmerdam resigned, sealing Gukesh’s second consecutive win in the 87th edition of the ""Wimbledon of Chess"".The game between Slovenia’s Vladimir Fedoseev and Praggnanandhaa Rameshbabu was another thriller. One of the tournament’s most formidable, in-form players, Fedoseev had already defeated Arjun Erigaisi, Fabiano Caruana, Vincent Keymer, and Pentala Harikrishna, suffering only one loss — to Alexey Sarana — before facing Praggnanandhaa in this Round 10 matchup.An unconventional Tarrasch Defense with the Two Knights Variation saw Fedoseev, defending with black, deploy his pieces in an early offensive.However, as he concentrated on stacking up his pieces on the left side of the board, Praggnanandhaa remained composed, refraining from an overzealous push and ensuring he retained the upper hand.With the queens traded off by move 36, Praggnanandhaa delivered a decisive rook check before successfully promoting his d8 pawn to a queen.With that, the game was effectively over, giving the Indian grandmaster a much-needed victory after his crushing defeat to Dutch No. 1 Anish Giri on Tuesday.Elsewhere, Arjun Erigaisi mounted a recovery with a much-needed draw against Germany’s Vincent Keymer, while last year’s Challengers winner, Leon Luke Mendonca, held off Giri in a 30-move battle.Meanwhile, Nodirbek Abdusattorov, Gukesh’s closest rival in the standings, secured a crucial win over Alexey Sarana with the white pieces. Pentala Harikrishna and Fabiano Caruana, after a gruelling 68-move duel, agreed to a draw.ALSO SEE: Tata Steel Chess 2025 Schedule In the Challengers section, it was a tough day for the Indian contingent as Vaishali Rameshbabu and Divya Deshmukh both suffered defeats, losing to table-topper Thai Dai Van Nguyen and Frederik Svane, respectively.39-year-old Erwin l’Ami edged past 11-year-old Argentine sensation Faustino Oro in a hard-fought game, while China's 14-year-old Lu Miaoyi played to a draw against Türkiye’s formidable Ediz Gurel.ALSO READ: India to host FIDE Chess World Cup 2025; Arjuna Awardee 'surprised' at the move",India’s Gukesh Dommaraju maintained his lead at the top of the Masters leaderboard at the 2025 Tata Steel Chess Tournament.

The Desert Vipers reclaimed their position at the summit of the points table through a convincing five-wicket win over the Gulf Giants at the Dubai International Stadium on Wednesday, assuring themselves of a top-two finish in the league stage of this ILT20 season. Max Holden controlled the below-par chase of Giants' 129 for 8 with a knock of 70 runs from 54 balls, after three-wicket hauls from Wanindu Hasaranga (3 for 10) and Sam Curran (3 for 28) helped the Vipers restrict the opposition to a low total.If it wasn't for Tom Curran's late onslaught with a quickfire 64 off 34 balls, the Giants' innings may not have reached the three-figure mark.The Vipers' chase faced early setbacks during the powerplay, losing both the opening batsmen. Mark Adair dismissed Alex Hales (9) while Blessing Muzarabani claimed Fakhar Zaman's (14) wicket in the first four overs, with the Vipers reaching 42 for 2 in Powerplay.Holden then stitched a 45-run partnership Sam Curran (16 off 19) until James Vince took a brilliant catch off Muzarabani (3 for 25) to dismiss Curran.Holden reached his half-century off 42 balls, striking 6 fours and 1 six. His unbroken 32-run partnership with Adam Hose (12*) in the end ensured a convincing win with an over to spare.Earlier, the Giants' innings never got settled amid regular fall of wickets, scoring just 31 runs in the Powerplay after losing opener James Vince for 15.Hasaranga proved devastating with the ball, dismantling the Giants' top order. He claimed Tom Alsop for 17, before trapping Jordan Cox LBW for only three.The Giants found themselves at 44 for 4 midway through their innings.The Giants were in serious trouble, but Tom Curran provided resistance with an impressive 30-ball half-century and added 14 more runs in the final over, helping his team cross the 125-run mark.","The Desert Vipers reclaimed their position at the summit of the points table through a convincing five-wicket win over the Gulf Giants.

WHY NODIRBEK DIDN’T SHAKE HANDS WITH VAISHALI

NEW DELHI: Hungarian-American chess grandmaster Susan Polgar criticized Uzbekistan’s Nodirbek Yakubboev after he refused to shake hands with Indian GM R Vaishali during the 2025 Tata Steel Chess tournament in the Netherlands.Yakubboev cited “religious reasons” for his decision, but Polgar challenged his stance by sharing a photo on social media showing him shaking hands with India’s Divya Deshmukh during the 29th Abu Dhabi International Chess Festival in 2023.“What is the difference?” Polgar questioned while tagging ChessBase India’s official handle.She further elaborated on her stance, stating that Yakubboev could have informed tournament officials or the female players in advance about his decision to avoid handshakes.“This is my opinion: I have less of an issue with the religious excuse. Others may disagree. But, he (Nodirbek Yakubboev) could have informed the organisers, chief arbiter, and/or his female opponents in advance. This is NOT an Open Swiss event. This is a prestigious invitational when he knew in advance that he would face 4 female opponents. If he wanted an exception then be proactive. Otherwise, he has to expect criticism,” she added.Nodirbek also addressed the issue on social media, explaining his reason for not shaking hands with Vaishali and apologising to the 23-year-old.“Dear chess friends, I want to explain the situation that happened in the game with Vaishali. With all due respect to women and Indian chess players , I want to inform everyone that I do not touch other women for religious reasons,” he had written on “X”.“I respect Vaishali and her brother as the strongest chess players in India. If I have offended her with my behavior, I apologize,” added Nodirbek.“I have some additional explanations: 1. Chess is not haram. 2. What I did before (referring to the game against Divya in 2023) I consider it wrong for me. I do what I need to do. I do not insist others not to shake hands with the opposite gender or for women to wear hijab or burqa. It is their business what to do.“Today I told Irina Bulmaga about it. She agreed to it. But when I came to the playing hall, the arbiters told me that I should at least do Namaste as a gesture. In the games with Divya and Vaishali I couldn’t tell them about it before the game and there was an awkward situation,” he concluded.","Nodirbek Yakubboev refused to shake hands with Indian GM R Vaishali during the 2025 Tata Steel Chess tournament in the Netherlands.

RAJKOT: First, the good news. Mohammed Shami made a decent, much-awaited return to international cricket after nearly 14 months, conceding 25 runs for no wickets in three overs and hitting a six towards the closing stages of the match. But it was Varun Chakravarthy who dominated the show, continuing to torment the Englishmen. The 'mystery spinner' took his maiden five-wicket haul in India (five for 24 in five overs).Now comes the bad news. Varun’s superb effort went in vain as India, batting poorly, were restricted by England’s much-improved bowlers to 146 for nine in 20 overs, losing by 26 runs to suffer their first defeat of the series in the third T20I at the Niranjan Shah Stadium here on Tuesday night.Given that the scoreline is 2-1 in favor of India now, England will look to equalise the score when they take on the hosts in the fourth T20I at Pune on Friday.Chasing 172, India lost wickets at regular intervals as England’s bowlers, led by Jamie Overton (3-23 in four overs), Jofra Archer (2-33), Brydon Carse (2-29), and leggie Adil Rashid (1-15 in four overs), who had earlier chipped in with a vital 10 not out, kept up the pressure.Enduring a poor series after smashing back-to-back centuries in South Africa, the inconsistent Sanju Samson (3) was caught at mid-on off Archer in the third over, while Abhishek Sharma (24, 14b, 5x4), who looked dangerous, was brilliantly caught by Archer, sprinting at cover, off Brydon Carse in the fourth over.India’s T20 skipper Suryakumar Yadav’s (14) poor run continued as he top-edged a pull off Mark Wood, with ‘keeper Phil Salt completing the catch, while the in-form Tilak Varma (17) was castled by a beauty of a leg-spinner from Rashid in the ninth over. Hardik Pandya (40, 35b, 1x4, 2x6) kept India in the game for a while, but was left throwing his bat in frustration after being caught by Overton at long-off.India’s strategy of playing four spinners in a T20 match backfired badly on the night. While Varun toyed with England’s batters, Bishnoi went for 1-46 in four overs, and off-spinner Washington Sundar, who was out for 6 batting at No 6, conceded 15 in the only over he bowled.Earlier, succumbing to Varun’s bag of tricks, England, who were flying at 83 for one in nine overs, with opener Ben Duckett (51, 28b, 7x4, 2x6) and skipper Jos Buttler (24, 22b, 1x4, 1x6) going great guns, lost nine wickets for 64 runs in a space of just 49 balls to slip to 147 for nine by the 18th over.Coming on to bowl in the sixth over, Varun gave away just three runs as both Duckett, who stroked his second T20I half-century, and Buttler looked to play him cautiously. However, once Buttler gloved a reverse sweep behind off the spinner, the floodgates opened.After Axar Patel had Duckett mistiming a hit to cow corner and Brook (8), who is enduring a horror run in this series, was bowled while under-edging a sweep off Bishnoi (his first wicket of the series), Varun began to slice through the England batting.Breathing fire, he was on a hat-trick in the 14th over as England’s ‘keeper-bat Jamie Smith (6) dragged him down to cow corner, while Jamie Overton (0) lost his leg stump while trying to paddle the bowler, going too far across.Brydon Carse (3) staved off the hat-trick, but perished soon, mistiming a sweep to give Tilak Varma a catch at deep square leg. Two balls later, Jofra Archer (0) was castled by a beauty that skidded off the pitch.Just as England were looking in danger of not even lasting for their full quota of 20 overs, the visitors’ Nos 10 and 11, Adil Rashid (10 not out) and Mark Wood (10 not out), did extremely well to hold on for 17 balls, adding 24 crucial runs in a 10th-wicket partnership—England’s joint-second best in T20Is—to take the score to 171 for nine in 20 overs.After Suryakumar won the toss for the third successive time and put England in, Liam Livingstone (43, 24b, 5x6, 1x6) launched a blistering counterattack, slog-sweeping and pulling Bishnoi for three sixes in the 17th over.With England’s batters failing to read him and making it worse for themselves by trying to play across the line to him, Varun has now taken 10 wickets for just 85 runs in the series so far, at an average of 8.50 and an economy rate of 7.08.The tweaker is the first bowler to take 10 wickets in a bilateral T20I series between India and England. Have India missed a trick by not picking the 33-year-old for the Champions Trophy next month, even considering questions around his fielding?Since his comeback after three years in the wilderness last year, Varun has taken 27 wickets in 10 matches at an average of 11.00 and a strike rate of 8.8 (per wicket).Earlier, India rested left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh, giving Shami some game time at last.","Varun Chakravarthy took his maiden five-wicket haul in India (five for 24 in five overs) India lost wickets at regular intervals as England’s bowlers, led by Jamie Overton, Jofra Archer, Brydon Carse and Adil Rashid, kept up the pressure. England will look to equalise the score when they take on the hosts in the fourth T20I at Pune on Friday.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117649817,imgsize-53220,width-400,resizemode-4/117649817.jpg"

Virat Kohli trains at Kotla ahead of Ranji Trophy return

(Translated to English: ""We need to do a lot of hard work, and your dad shouldn't be asking you to go for pratice and training. You yourself should wake up early and say 'I have to go for practice'. And if someone practices for one hour, you practice for two hours. That's the only way, right? If someone makes a fifty, you score a hundred. If someone makes a hundred, you score two hundred -- double of the benchmark. Then you will go a level up. If you need to be told to practice, then that's not right."")

comeback match against Railways may not determine his international future, but

still arrived 90 minutes before the entire Delhi team & went through a rigorous day of preparation on match eve

TimesView Virat Kohli and other major stars playing in the Ranji Trophy is good news for the cricketers as well as Indian cricket. Provided they are rested after international duty, this should be the norm, not an exception.

NEW DELHI: The frenzy around Virat Kohli seemed to have calmed down at the Ferozeshah Kotla on Wednesday. There was, however, no drop in intensity in the batter's preparations going into his first Ranji Trophy game in 12 years. A day before Delhi's match against Railways, Kohli showed just why and how he has managed to be India's most cherished cricketer over the last decade.Kohli arrived at the Arun Jaitley Stadium 90 minutes before the rest of the Delhi team, at 7.30 am. He hit the new gym facilities even before DDCA officials arrived at the premises and went through a rigorous session. He then joined the Delhi team for the usual high intensity warm-up drills followed by a game of football. He then capped the day with another thorough nets session. All of this at the age of 36, when speculation about the future of his international career has gathered steam.A few cricketers from the Delhi team who reached a little earlier than the usual reporting time of 9 am rushed to the gym to observe and train with Kohli for a while. They had a first-hand look at the relentless routine that has made Kohli a model cricketer.The match against Railways from Thursday will most likely be Delhi's last game this season, with a quarterfinal spot looking like a distant dream at the moment. However, a win here could give Railways a real chance of qualifying for the knockout stages.For Kohli, though, the match is about making a statement of sorts. The return coincides with his recent struggles in Test cricket which have led to criticism. If one has observed Kohli over the last two days at the Kotla, there is no doubting the sincerity of his approach.Delhi captain Ayush Badoni gave a crisp reply to a query on Kohli's inputs so far. ""He just said that we should be confident, express ourselves and play with a lot of intensity, like he does,"" Badoni told reporters.Runs in this game won't influence the national selectors' outlook towards Kohli. If anything, this outing is about Kohli's pride. Much has been made of his recent weakness outside the off stump, and the repeated failures would have no doubt hurt the ego of a cricketer with over 9000 Test runs and 30 Test centuries.Kohli has gone through specific drills here in the nets, like taking throwdowns with a slim bat which has been specifically designed to simulate hitting the ball with the middle of a regular bat. He also worked on run scoring options on the off-side other than his trademark cover drives.It was always unlikely Kohli would seek out any of the Delhi support staff to discuss his technique. Probably, he has devised some drills with his go-to man, former India batting coach Sanjay Bangar , before arriving in Delhi. But he did spend some time with head coach Sarandeep Singh, who served as national selector during Kohli's tenure as India captain. Kohli was seen explaining to him some things about his batting after a 45-minute stint in the nets.This Ranji Trophy match, then, is part of Kohli's extensive preparation for the upcoming international season. The thick layering of green on the Kotla pitch and the heavy conditions due to the receding winter could offer him a decent opportunity to challenge himself. One expects a sizeable crowd to turn up at the Kotla on Thursday, and that too might be to Kohli's liking.","Kohli arrived at the Arun Jaitley Stadium 90 minutes before the rest of the Delhi team, at 7.30 am.

Virat Kohli trains at Kotla ahead of Ranji Trophy return

NEW DELHI: Australian opener Usman Khawaja delivered a resounding response to his critics, crafting a sublime century on a turning track in Galle during the first Test against Sri Lanka on Wednesday.His 16th Test hundred, achieved in the second session, ended a 19-month wait for a triple-figure score and reaffirmed his importance in Australia’s red-ball squad.Known for his composure and mental toughness, Khawaja reflected on overcoming rough patches in his career. Speaking after the day's play, he credited his faith, family, and perspective beyond cricket for keeping him grounded.""This hundred is really special—everything comes from the Almighty, and I truly believe that. Whether good or bad, you take it in stride. Even if things seem tough, I always believe it's for the best,"" Khawaja told SEN Cricket.""There have been so many ups and downs in my life where I thought, 'This is bad,' but something amazing always came from it. Cricket doesn’t dictate my life. I have a beautiful family and a supportive wife—there’s much more to life than just cricket. But I still love playing, so I'll always train hard and give my best. At some point, you just have to let go and trust the big man up there.""While celebrating his own milestone, Khawaja also lauded Steve Smith , who had a landmark day in Galle. Smith first crossed 10,000 Test runs before going on to notch his 35th Test hundred, further cementing his legacy as one of the modern greats.Having played alongside Smith for over a decade, Khawaja spoke warmly about their journey together.""I've known Smudge since he was 16. We played first grade against each other, came through the New South Wales system together, and have spent years representing Australia. I've batted with him more than anyone in Test cricket, and we share a great camaraderie. We started as boys, and now we’re men. It was really special to be out there for his 10,000th run. I thought I’d witness it in Sydney, but I missed out, so I was glad to be there today. I'm very happy for him.""With both centurions in fine form, Australia hold a strong position in the Galle Test . As the duo looks to extend their partnership on Day 2, Khawaja remains optimistic.""And it's not over yet—you’ll still see Steve and me batting tomorrow. We’re looking forward to it, and I think it’s only going to get better,"" he added with a smile.","Usman Khawaja scored his 16th Test hundred in Galle on Wednesday.
