In Qualifier 1 of IPL 2024 , the high-flying Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) and the unpredictable Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH), both teams known for their power-hitting, will clash on Tuesday in Ahmedabad with the aim of outmuscling each other.KKR were the first team to secure a playoff spot this year, while SRH boosted their chances significantly by defeating the Punjab Kings by four wickets on Sunday, finishing second with 17 points, ahead of the Rajasthan Royals.Both teams have enjoyed a brief break due to incessant rains affecting their matches over the past 10 days. However, the quick turnaround for this high-stakes playoff game presents a unique challenge. KKR and SRH will have just a day to travel across thousands of kilometers to compete in the first half of the playoffs, having both played on the final day of the league stage on Sunday.SRH may feel more confident after their comprehensive win over PBKS and having recent game-time experience. In contrast, KKR's last complete game was on May 11. Shreyas Iyer's KKR had a four-game winning streak before rain washed away their last two league games.As table-toppers with 19 points, KKR will need to fill the significant void left by their second-highest run-scorer and wicketkeeper Phil Salt (435 runs), who has departed for national duties with England ahead of the T20 World Cup.Salt had formed a formidable partnership with Sunil Narine (461 runs) at the top, and KKR benefited greatly from their aggressive batting approach, supported by a strong middle order, despite skipper Iyer's (287 runs) lack of major impact so far.The rain-affected match against RR denied KKR the opportunity to test Rahmanullah Gurbaz as a replacement opener with Narine, which could have addressed some concerns.For KKR, Nitish Rana's form provides additional stability to the middle order, while a fiery Andre Russell promises vital runs as a finisher.In many ways, SRH matches KKR's firepower on paper, which adds to the allure of this contest.Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma have both achieved remarkable strike rates exceeding 200, inspiring their side to break several records. The Australian left-hander Head has redefined batting aggressiveness, scoring 533 runs, including one century and four fifties. His fearless approach has also elevated the performance of young Indian batter Abhishek, who has smashed 41 sixes this IPL — 10 more than his combined tally from the previous six seasons.SRH has also addressed some long-standing questions. At No. 3, they have found a dependable option in Rahul Tripathi, who can accelerate the innings or anchor it during challenging spells from the bowlers. Additionally, Heinrich Klaasen has rediscovered his form after a mid-tournament slump, evidenced by his crucial 42-run knock against PBKS, making SRH even more formidable.In Ahmedabad, as demonstrated in last year's World Cup final, teams batting second have had more success, winning four out of six completed games, with only two teams successfully defending their scores. Despite both teams favoring a high-scoring style, this venue has seen only two 200-plus scores in 12 innings, suggesting bowlers will also play a crucial role.KKR's bowling attack features a strong spin line-up supporting their fast bowlers led by Mitchell Starc, while SRH's pace attack, spearheaded by skipper Pat Cummins, has consistently delivered cohesive performances.In their only encounter earlier this season, KKR edged out SRH by four runs in a high-scoring match, setting the stage for an exciting playoff clash.","KKR were the first team to secure a playoff spot this year, while SRH boosted their chances significantly by defeating the Punjab Kings by four wickets on Sunday.

(With ANI inputs)

NEW DELHI: During his YouTube channel interview with Ravichandran Ashwin on Monday, Kolkata Knight Riders mentor Gautam Gambhir discussed the Indian Premier League rivalry between Chennai Super Kings and Kolkata Knight Riders.In the 31 IPL head-to-head encounters between the Knight Riders and the Super Kings since 2008, CSK emerged victorious 19 times against KKR 's 11 victories, with one encounter ending in no-result.The 42-year-old claimed that, in his opinion, the strategies used by the Chennai and Kolkata teams to approach the game were very similar.""It's not only the magnitude of the contest. When two good teams play against each other, it's going to be an exciting and hard-fought game. I always felt that CSK and KKR were very, very similar in the way they approached the game,"" Gambhir said on Ashwin's YouTube channel.The former left-hander went on to say that both sides' plans were extremely similar.""The way MS Dhoni used the spinners and we had three quality spinners as well. CSK had three quality spinners and probably the conditions, whether it was in Chepauk or in Eden at that time, were very similar. Chepauk had bigger dimensions as compared to what Eden as a ground is. Our strategies were very similar to each other. That is the reason KKR had to be at our best from the tactical point of view to be able to beat CSK. That's the reason why I always felt that CSK and KKR during those times were very very similar teams,"" the former India opener added.In November last year, Gambhir made a comeback to the KKR team as a mentor. Prior to that, he played the same role for the Lucknow Super Giants in the IPL in 2021 and 2022. Regarding his IPL experience, the southpaw has participated for both KKR and the Delhi Capitals. As captain of the Knight Riders in 2012 and 2014, he won two IPL championships.KKR will play for a spot in the final when they take on Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) in Qualifier 1 on Tuesday at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad.","Gautam Gambhir says Chennai Super Kings and Kolkata Knight Riders' strategies were very similar. CSK have won 19 of the 31 IPL head-to-head encounters between the two teams since 2008. KKR have won 11 of those matches, with one encounter ending in no-result.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110285557,imgsize-70030,width-400,resizemode-4/110285557.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram has expressed his disappointment over the absence of England players from the IPL 2024 playoffs due to national commitments, highlighting a growing concern in the cricketing world. In stark contrast to Sunil Gavaskar , who has proposed financial penalties, Akram believes that cutting salaries will not resolve the issue.Speaking to Sportskeeda, Akram stated, ""If you cut salaries, will it affect anything if your team doesn't win after reaching the playoffs? You've put in all the hard work and in the last hurdle, your boys leave because they have to play for the country. It's not fair.""He emphasized the importance of full-season availability for players in any T20 league , including the IPL, Pakistan Super League (PSL), or Big Bash League (BBL).""This is what you play for. That's why it's frustrating not just for fans but owners, and captains of the teams for any league. So, I agree with Irfan [Pathan], come for the entire tournament otherwise don't come,"" Akram added.Akram also criticized the England Cricket Board ( ECB ) for not issuing full No Objection Certificates (NOCs) to its players, causing disruptions for the IPL teams.In contrast, former Indian cricketer Sunil Gavaskar, writing in his column for Mid-Day, took a different approach, suggesting that financial penalties should be imposed on both players and their boards.""I am all for players choosing country before anything else but having assured various franchises about their availability for the full season, if they pull out now, it will be letting down the franchises which probably pay them more money in one IPL season which they don't earn in a few seasons with their country,"" Gavaskar wrote. ""The franchises should not only be allowed to deduct a substantial amount from the fee that the player was bought for, but also not give the Board, to which the player belongs, the stated 10 percent commission of the fee that each player gets.""Akram, while discussing the prospects of IPL 2024 teams, highlighted Sunrisers Hyderabad as strong contenders due to their complete squad availability.""Luckily, SRH didn't pick England players. They are definitely one of the contenders. The way their playing XI is and the manner in which they play. They have all the players, so that will give them the extra boost,"" he said.However, Akram expressed concerns over Rajasthan Royals ' chances in the playoffs due to the absence of key player Jos Buttler , who has been instrumental with two match-winning centuries this season.""They [Rajasthan Royals] might struggle. There will be a huge difference after Jos Buttler's departure. It will be both in the playing XI as well as psychological. I hope they overcome it. If they don't, they won't win the trophy. So, it's a do-or-die for them,"" Akram added.",Wasim Akram has expressed his disappointment over the absence of England players from the IPL 2024 playoffs due to national commitments.

AHMEDABAD: A staggering 1,208 sixes in 70 matches have been struck in the current edition of IPL . Leading the count with 160 in 13 matches, is none other than Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH), whose batting has personified their fearless approach and helped them climb from bottom (last year) to second (this year) position in the table.Led by the dynamic Australian pacer Pat Cummins , SRH will be eager to go the distance this time around. But first, they will have to cross a hurdle in the form of Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) in the first qualifier in Ahmedabad on Tuesday.Mentored by Gautam Gambhir , under whom KKR won their two IPL titles in 2014 and 2016, the Knight Riders have been the form team this season. The opening pair of West Indian Sunil Narine and Englishman Phil Salt, who has left for national duty, have hit the new ball bowlers to all parts of the ground. But with both their last league matches getting rained off, Kolkata haven't been able to test Salt's like-for-like replacement, Rahmanullah Gurbaz.The middle-order comprising Venkatesh Iyer, captain Shreyas Iyer , southpaw Nitish Rana have sustained the momentum provided by the openers while Rinku Singh and Andre Russell have chipped in with vital contributions down the order.The Sunrisers' bowling mix of veteran pacer Bhuvneshwar Kumar , left-arm pacer T Natarajan and Cummins will test the KKR batting. With Sri Lankan spinner Wanindu Hasaranga missing in action, Vijayakanth Viyaskanth has provided the spin bowling option along with left-arm spinner Shahbaz Ahmed.SRH have matched KKR's might at the top of the order with left-handed batters Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma going hammer and tongs from the first ball.Even in their last league match against Punjab Kings, despite losing Head for a first-ball duck in pursuit of 215, SRH batted aggressively to cross the line in the last over.Sharma has been a revelation. Coming off a stellar domestic season, in which he helped Punjab clinch the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy last year, the left-handed batter has dazzled fans and even opponents with his repertoire of strokeplay. Head and Sharma both strike at a rate in excess of 200, enough to send shivers in the opposition ranks.Rahul Tripathi, Reddy and Heinrich Klassen provide the impetus in the middle order while Abdul Samad and Ahmed are also capable hitters. They will be up against KKR pacer Mitchell Starc, who might not have lived up to his hefty price tag but can decimate any batting unit with his full-length deliveries.Harshit Rana (16 wickets) and Vaibhav Arora have bowled well in tandem while the spin bowling duo of Varun Chakaravarthy (18 wickets) ) and Narine (15 wickets) have not only been difficult to get away but have struck whenever the team needed them.In the only clash between the two teams earlier this season, KKR edged SRH by four runs in a high-scoring thriller at the Eden Garden. If that game is anything to go by, Ahmedabad should be in for a humdinger of a clash.Following last Monday's rain which washed out Gujarat's last home match against KKR, the weather has been very hot, and it remains to be seen how the playing surface will play out.","Sunrisers Hyderabad face Kolkata Knight Riders in the first qualifier in Ahmedabad on Tuesday.

We were very hungry to turn it around: Faf du Plessis,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/we-were-very-hungry-to-turn-it-around-faf-du-plessis/articleshow/110286730.cms,"In an exclusive interview with TOI,

skipper

reveals the work that went into transforming the team from also-rans to title contenders

Excerpts:

What's the pressure of leading a fancied team which is yet to win an

title?

The start of the season was like a horror show for RCB. What is it that you think the team lacked?

How did you address the elephant in the room?

How did the support staff led by Mo Bobat and Andy Flower help?

Can you take us through the turnaround?

How did you deal with the players who were going through a lean phase?

If someone had said a few weeks back that you could mount a comeback like this without an all-rounder like Maxwell, would you have believed it?

The break seems to have done Maxwell a world of good…

Your thoughts on your bowlers' comeback?

So, the strategic move of dropping Siraj for a match worked well?

As a leader, when the chips are down, how do you keep the boat afloat?

You are nearing 40, what keeps you going, especially your electric presence as a fielder?

Irrespective of what happens in the Eliminator, how proud are you of this team?

BENGALURU: At the halfway mark of the Indian Premier League, few would have wagered on Royal Challengers Bengaluru making the playoffs of the world's most glamorous T20 tournament. Yet, RCB scripted one of the most stunning turnarounds by winning all their last six league matches to cement their place in the top-four.Pilloried for the team's performance in the first half, captain Faf du Plessis, a veteran of international and franchise cricket , remained stoic. He accepted defeat with grace, acknowledged his team's shortcomings, but also emphasised that giving up wasn't an option.With the Eliminator against former champions Rajasthan Royals in Ahmedabad looming, the 39-year-old du Plessis believes the job is still only half done. In an exclusive interview with TOI, his first this season, the South African spoke at length about his team's journey this season.Captaincy comes with a bit more than what's on your plate. I've been doing it for such a long time, I see that as an opportunity more than pressure. You're never going to get away from the fact that there's pressure, whether you're captaining a big franchise like RCB or a country like South Africa. But I've always loved doing it and I've enjoyed this experience. The last three years at RCB have been awesome for me to almost find a new purpose after captaining the Proteas. I've loved every minute.When you start a tournament, you do everything you can to make sure that you are prepared. And we did certainly do that. I feel like we ticked every single box. But you need some other things to fall into place. You need form, which always plays a big part at the beginning of a competition. You also need a bit of luck as injuries and stuff like that also play a role.There were a few guys in the team looking to find their best form. If you take from a batting perspective, it was only probably Virat (Kohli) at that stage who was in good form and scoring runs. There's always another guy or a third guy that's still scoring the runs and, in our case, we didn't have that. I was searching for runs, so were Rajat (Patidar), Maxi ( Glenn Maxwell ) and (Cameron) Greenie. So as a whole batting unit, we were just looking to find our best form. From a bowling perspective, guys like (Mohammed) Siraj were looking to find form. Siraj came into the competition having played a lot of red-ball cricket.When you lose a couple of games, then your confidence starts taking a little bit of a hit. And with the standard of the IPL being so high, you as an individual and as a team need to make sure that you're as close to your best to be able to perform as a team.In the middle of the season, I felt we needed to do some things better in terms of learning from our mistakes, not doing the same things over and over again. So, we changed our reviewing of games. We looked at our first few games from an analytical point of view. We made sure that we looked at the data, the numbers and the style of play that was successful at that stage. We looked at the best teams and analysed where we were. We were very clear in what we needed to do to become better. Form was the issue we wanted to fix and looking back, once that was worked out, it ensured a change of our fortunes. The confidence started coming back in the group and everyone started pulling in performances. It obviously turned into a miraculous turnaround where every single member in the team feels like they're contributing well.Andy and Mo were excellent. They were calm and optimistic that we were going to get it right.We were very hungry to turn it around and felt like we weren't far away from it. We just needed one game to get that confidence through the group. And once we had that first victory, it was like there was a shift in everyone's mindset and everyone was like, Ok, right, this is what we've been waiting for a very long time. And you look back six games ago now and you go, the cricket that we've played in the last six games has been nothing short of extraordinary.I'm a big believer in that we're not machines and so you're not always going to perform. I try to take the pressure off the performance element and just look at the person. You need to make sure that you put that person in an environment where he feels like he can bring out the best version of himself. There's also a level of trust that goes with that. I think if a player feels that he's backed and he's trusted, he will come good. I care for the guys in the group. So hopefully, they can see that.At the beginning of the tournament, if someone told me that Green, Maxwell, myself, Patidar, Siraj would be not performing in the first four games, I would have said that's not possible. There's no way I would have believed that. But obviously, guys came in at that stage, someone like Will Jacks had a real impact for us.We all know that Maxi is an unbelievable cricketer. Sometimes, form is not on your side and you fight so hard to try and get it back. Especially in a competition like this, you tend to go deeper into trying too hard and then it goes the other way. He had a nice break where he could just slowly find his mojo again off the field and start focusing on stripping it down to the basics of his game again and train in a way where there's no pressure on a game the next day. He's got a lot of experience, so he knows how to get there. I'm very optimistic that the backend of the tournament is where we're going to see Maxi thrive. He's obviously a guy who's been in big matches before and he's always been a guy who stands up in big games.Unbelievable. There's always so much (negative) talk about RCB bowlers, which I don't believe in it. Since coming into this team, there's not one thing here that works separately. It's us as a team. So, there's never going to be the bowlers or the batters who are to blame.In the beginning, the bowlers were struggling a bit. And then you need big characters who stand up. Yash Dayal this year has been tremendous. He's been consistent, carrying the bowling attack almost right through. And then it was like this wildfire that just spread confidence through the group. All the bowlers started to fire. We've bowled teams out two or three times, which in today's era, it's almost unheard of. The ability to get wickets for us has been a huge reason why we've done so well.Credit to Siraj's character. There was a point in the season where we felt that it was the right thing for him just to try someone else. And Siraj, as any big player would be in that position, was probably not expecting that. But for us, it was a brave call. And in hindsight, I think that was a good decision because what happened was one game on the bench and he came back absolutely firing with a point to prove. He's been excellent since then.Experience. That takes you through some difficult times when you're a little bit older. I've gone through the worst and the best. And in that, I've learned that it's important to stay the same in your highs and lows. So, whether you've got great success of winning the IPL or massive failures of crashing out of a tournament, I think what people look for is that calmness and consistency.Credit to the team owners as well for the way they handled situations. It was Game 7 or Game 8, I told them thank you for being so calm and positive. It's easy to be friendly and positive and upbeat and optimistic when a team is doing well. But you really measure whether it's a person's leadership or a group's leadership when things are going the opposite way.Being at the age of where I am, your mind plays probably the biggest factor in what you want to try and achieve. My mind still loves the game of cricket. I still want to try and get better. I still want to learn from the game. I don't feel I'm at that point where I'm just in cruise control. I really put a lot of work into my fitness and my body. I train differently from what I did when I was younger.I'm very proud. When we were one out of eight, I didn't hear one ounce of negativity from any of the players or staff. Everyone was still the same - caring and hoping for the best for each other. Everyone wants to win. Everyone wants to play and do well. But I tend to look at the other side of things. How can you make sure that you can create a good environment where people are enjoying their cricket and having fun? I'm having a great time with a great group of guys, who I am extremely proud of.",Royal Challengers Bengaluru have won all their last six league matches.

He had never asked me a single question on cricket in those seven years. Can you imagine?"" Gambhir said on Ravichandran Ashwin 's YouTube channel.KKR struggled last year, finishing seventh with 12 points.

We don't talk about cricket. The first thing he told me in 2011 when I met him for the first time he said I don't like anybody telling me how acting needs to be done. I am sure you will not like someone telling you how cricket needs to be played. I said absolutely and that was the only conversation I had with him. In the last 20 days, he has not asked me what team are we playing or what is the strategy,"" Gambhir said.The team mentor attributed this trust to honesty and accountability, stating that he would be the first to take responsibility if something went wrong.

NEW DELHI: Australia have added two promising names, Jake Fraser-McGurk and Matt Short , to their Twenty20 World Cup squad as travelling reserves.Fraser-McGurk was in excellent form while playing for the Delhi Capitals in the Indian Premier League , and Short, who can also contribute with his off-spin bowling, was a standout performer in the recent Big Bash League in Australia.Despite their impressive performances, both players narrowly missed out on being included in the initial 15-man squad due to the strength of Australia's top order, which includes the likes of David Warner , Travis Head , and Mitchell Marsh .However, chief selector George Bailey acknowledged their strong cases for selection, stating, ""Matt and Jake made compelling cases for initial selection with their respective performances for Australia last summer and, in Jake's case, more recently in the IPL.""Bailey also explained the reasoning behind their inclusion as travelling reserves, citing the challenges posed by the tournament's tight schedule.""As the tournament proceeds, the short turnaround between fixtures makes it challenging to get players in at short notice in the event of injury.

When Royal Challengers Bengaluru ( RCB ) defeated Chennai Super Kings (CSK) in their do-or-die match in Bengaluru last Saturday, they scripted a comeback that is nothing less than iconic and will be remembered for the years to come.After losing seven of their first eight matches, the Bengaluru team, led by Faf du Plessis and inspired by Orange Cap holder Virat Kohli (708 runs), won their next six matches on the trot to push CSK out of the race and finish in the top four on the leaderboard.That made RCB the first IPL team ever to qualify for the playoffs after losing seven of their first eight matches in the season.Former India allrounder Irfan Pathan, who has the experience of playing in the IPL, described what this remarkable turnaround means to the league and RCB.""This season has been iconic (for RCB). You don't do such things again and again. RCB se aapko ummeed isliye nahi thi kyuki unki gendbaazi unit itni pukhta hai nahi (you didn't have hope from RCB because their bowling unit is not that strong),"" said Irfan on Star Sports.""If you see the teams that have made it to the top four (playoffs), if you compare their bowling units, RCB's bowling is not that strong. You don't have a bowler who can bowl yorkers. Despite that, you win six matches in a row and qualify for the playoffs. For that reason, this is an iconic season -- for Virat Kohli, for Faf du Plessis, for RCB and their fans. I haven't recovered until now,"" the player cum commentator added.The league phase concluded on Sunday to confirm the standings in the top four, with Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR, 20 points) finishing on top, Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH, 17 points) number two, Rajasthan Royals (RR, 17 points) third and RCB (14 points) at the fourth position.RCB finished ahead of CSK, Delhi Capitals and Lucknow Super Giants (all with 14 points) on net run rate.That means KKR and SRH will play Qualifier 1, while RR and RCB will face off in the Eliminator. The winners of Qualifier 1 move directly into the final, while the losers take on the winning team from the Eliminator to decide the second finalist.Pathan reckoned it takes life out of you if you don't win a match for one month, which happened with RCB this season, but still they didn't give up and rose like a Phoenix.""RCB kharab khel rahi thi shuru mei (RCB were playing bad at the start). They didn't win a match for one month...I have played the IPL. If you lose even two matches in a row, your hands and legs start shaking...If you don't win for a month, you are dead. They (RCB) have risen like a phoenix. From the dead, they have come alive...That's the kind of cricket they have played.

They are playing a series against Pakistan. The England players wouldn't have gone back if it wasn't for the Pakistan series,"" Vaughan said on Cricbuzz.""The series was on the calendar. With English cricket, the defence of the 50-over World Cup was a poor one by England here in India. So I think, Jos and his team, 5 games against Pakistan, they get together. The actual lead-up to the 50-over World Cup wasn't perfect either. There were a lot of swaps and changes. They have now gone back to 5 matches, get all the squad together, work on a bit of culture, everyone playing their right roles, I think it will give them a better chance,"" he further added.In this year's IPL, there were a number of occasions when no double-headers were scheduled on Saturdays.In the past, IPL has been scheduled in such ways that Saturdays and Sundays squeeze in 4 games. But with not many Saturday doubleheaders, this time around, IPL got a bit stretched.Vaughan explained that if the season wasn't stretched, England players wouldn't have left early.""Because the schedule is always so late, I think England would have planned for that. I think they would have thought it would have finished today (May 19). Players would have gone back. Players that were playing today's final would have stayed, those weren't, wouldn't have disappeared and England would have played the 5 games (against Pakistan) with a full-strength squad,"" Vaughan.Buttler (Rajasthan Royals), Liam Livingstone (Punjab Kings), Will Jacks, and Reece Topley (Royal Challengers Bengaluru) earlier left the IPL to join the England squad ahead of the T20I series against Pakistan, beginning on May 22.","Sunil Gavaskar and Irfan Pathan came down heavily on England players for leaving IPL early.

NEW DELHI: Kolkata Knight Riders mentor Gautam Gambhir recently shared emotional memories from his tenure with the team recalling the memorable incident that showcased the unwavering support he received from the fans.During a match against the Pune Warriors, Gambhir found himself up against Bengal's beloved son, Sourav Ganguly , who was leading the opposing team.And despite the fact that Ganguly was a revered figure in Kolkata, the fans stood firmly behind Gambhir, demonstrating their loyalty and appreciation for his contributions to KKR In a conversation with Ravichandran Ashwin on his YouTube channel, the former World Cup winner took a trip down memory lane as KKR's winning season continued, thinking back on his 2011 arrival at the team and his journey from a cricket player from Delhi to a beloved figure in Kolkata.Between the highs and lows, Gambhir described a crucial match at Eden Gardens against Pune Warriors. During the game, the stadium was a picture of conflicting allegiances, with KKR's distinctive purple and Pune's light blue. Ganguly a Kolkata native was leading Pune, and Gambhir was leading KKR.""A lot of people told me there will be a lot of backlashes because you are replacing someone like Sourav Ganguly. I still remember my first day in Kolkata the amount of love I received was unimaginable. Never thought that I would receive that kind of love because a lot of things were spoken about when Sourav was replaced. But not even once in my seven years of captaincy I was not made to feel that I did not belong to Kolkata and that's my relationship with the people,"" Gambhir told Ashwin on his YouTube channel.Amidst the pressure of media attention and high expectations, Gambhir revealed a heartfelt story from the pre-match build-up.""I have said it not because I was captaining them I have said it from my heart that Kolkata is my home and that's the emotion I carry because I remember this one game. We were playing against Pune Warriors and where I think the entire stadium was divided into Purple and Blue and Sourav was leading Pune Warriors. There was this huge article on the match day where it was written in an article that Bengal would be divided for the second time after partition. It was the headline of the front page,"" he added.Gambhir revealed that a hotel employee approached him as he was leaving the team hotel for the game and gave words of consolation and support. Gambhir remembered the staff member's touching message and the KKR mentor found great meaning in these words of support, which strengthened his will to guide his side to victory.As evidence of the unique relationship that exists between Kolkata and KKR, Gambhir highlighted the significant influence that these kinds of acts of kindness had on his seven-year tenure with the team.""I remember walking out of the hotel we were staying in the same hotel and there was this guy at the gate he said that when you walk today when you go for the toss just remember the entire Bengal will be only cheering for you because KKR belongs to Kolkata and you will not walk alone today and I carried that thought with me to the toss and not even once in my seven years of captaincy I have never walked alone.Gambhir found strength in the unwavering support of the Kolkata fans, despite the first doubts. The 42-year-old reflected on the Pune Warriors match, he thanked everyone for their persistent support and acknowledged how crucial it was to their achievement.""The people of Kolkata have walked with me and that's the strength I got from Kolkata and that's the reason that when I come back to Kolkata it is always about giving back to them,"" he added.Meanwhile, Gambhir's KKR will play for a spot in the final when they take on Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) in Qualifier 1 on Tuesday at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad.","Kolkata Knight Riders mentor Gautam Gambhir has shared emotional memories from his tenure with the team.

NEW DELHI: Former India opener and current KKR mentor Gautam Gambhir on Monday appreciated the high standard of cricket in the Indian Premier League but said that the tournament should not serve as the primary route for young players to secure a spot in the national team.Gambhir, who represented India, emphasized on the importance of maintaining a balance between the IPL and other domestic cricket competitions.The 42-year-old argued that while the IPL provides valuable exposure and experience, it should not overshadow the significance of traditional formats and tournaments in the development of aspiring cricketers.Speaking on Ravichandran Ashwin's YouTube show, 'Kutti Stories with Ash', Gambhir said, ""The bigger concern that arises is about how many youngsters want to play Test cricket for India. I hope the IPL is not a shortcut to play for India.""The KKR team mentor also asserted that the IPL has benefitted the Indian domestic cricketers.""Today, when I look at international T20 sides, apart from 2-3 teams, I don't see enough competition when it comes to playing for India,"" he said.""Not many teams can match the quality that India has. So, I feel that in today's day and age, IPL has become far more competitive than international T20 cricket.""Just the quality of the domestic players has changed, the way domestic players want to play in the IPL and the way they work around T20 cricket -- I think most of their focus is on playing T20 cricket.""Gambhir, who helped India win the ODI World Cup final in 2011 alongside MS Dhoni and led KKR to twin Indian Premier League titles in 2012 and 2014, returned to the side as the team mentor this season.The 42-year-old is known for his outspoken attitude and serious demeanour.Speaking on the same, Gambhir said, ""I'm not breaking any rules. I want to be as aggressive as I can be. And what's wrong with that?""That's my nature. That's my characteristic because, for me, winning, it's an obsession, and I'm obsessed with winning. That's the problem I have.""Gambhir also clarified that he doesn't need to smile since the fans come to watch him help the team win and that all he cares about is his players giving their 100% on the field.""Sometimes when people talk about – he doesn't smile or love. He's always intense, grumpy, walking on the edge, old and has his game face on,"" he said.""People don't come to watch me smile. Unfortunately, people come to watch me win. That's the kind of profession we guys are in. I can't help it.""""I'm not an entertainment. I'm not a Bollywood actor, or I'm not a corporate.

We want to be playing as a team and get used to our roles.""There's a lot of buzz around the group, it seems like we're back to our energy and it seems like the boys are really fizzed about this trophy hopefully coming back.""The first game of the four-match T20 series against Pakistan takes place at Headingley on Wednesday.",England all-rounder Sam Curran expresses team's excitement over Jofra Archer's return.

Five things to know about incoming Anfield boss Arne Slot,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/epl/top-stories/five-things-to-know-about-incoming-anfield-boss-arne-slot/articleshow/110281122.cms,"THE HAGUE: Arne Slot , the former Feyenoord coach who was confirmed as Liverpool manager on Monday, is known as a passionate leader who gets the most out of his player and demands a strong work ethic.A fan of Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola , Slot was a slick forward as a player with a reputation as an accurate passer -- so much so he has a move named after him.Here are five key facts about the 45-year-old who will replace Jurgen Klopp at Anfield.Slot joined PEC Zwolle as a 17-year-old striker known more for his technique than his running.""Many people thought Arne was lazy and phlegmatic. But that wasn't right. You just shouldn't expect sliding tackles,"" his former coach Jan Everse told public broadcaster NOS.""Silky"" and ""cultured"" are words often used to describe his playing style, and PEC Zwolle still employ the ""Arne Slot Pass"", said former team-mate Bram van Polen.The Arne Slot Pass is a slight deflection from a forward with his back to goal which splits the defence and releases a winger running off the ball.When Slot's name became linked to the Anfield job, Liverpool fans, looking for clues to their future boss' style, widely shared a rousing team talk he gave Feyenoord players after an historic victory at Ajax.""The reason why we are where we are today is because you work your ass off every single day. And that's the reason you could beat this team in their own stadium, without our fans being here,"" he told the dressing room.""But it's only a win. It's a big win, but we have a bigger goal this season than winning for the first time in 17 years in Amsterdam,"" Slot said to cheers from the team.Liverpool were not the first Premier League club to show interest in Slot. He was heavily linked with Tottenham during their troubled search to replace Antonio Conte in May 2023.As Spurs were reportedly about to seal the deal, Slot abruptly walked out, signing a new contract instead with Rotterdam-based Feyenoord.""The decisive factor was playing in the Champions League... the fact that I am having a great time privately and being able to build on the past two seasons,"" said the Dutchman at the time.Feyenoord's Champions League campaign got off to a strong start with a 2-0 home win against Celtic, but two defeats against Atletico Madrid sealed their fate, and they finished third in Group E.The British press have already dubbed Slot the ""Dutch Pep Guardiola"" for the high-pressing attacking style much beloved by Feyenoord fans.In several interviews, he has cited Guardiola as his role model, telling the Algemeen Dagblad (AD) last year: ""Players always look very good under him. And the same players seem worse with managers before and after him.""Slot certainly admires the legendary Spanish coach of Manchester City but will now face the task of trying to stop him from winning a record-extending fifth consecutive Premier League title next season.As a coach, Slot is known for a fierce work ethic, driving to Feyenoord's camp before dawn, watching every training session, and obsessively studying future opponents.""I say to Feyenoord: you have to ensure that you create four times as many chances as your opponent and work twice as hard,"" Slot told the AD.""In all the matches that we have won this season, we see in the data that we have run 20 or 30 percent more than the opposition. Matches we didn't win: only three or six percent more.""""Every training, every meeting must be spot on,"" he said.This has led to results for Feyenoord, seen as a team with physically fit players who work hard for each other and often score late goals.Slot appears to have cultivated this work ethic as a manager, rather than when he was a player.""He wants his boys to be fit... he didn't have that before. I don't know if he has ever seen the inside of a weights room,"" said former team-mate Van Polen.",Arne Slot was confirmed as Liverpool manager on Monday.

NEW DELHI: Former Feyenoord coach Arne Slot was Monday confirmed as Jurgen Klopp's successor at Liverpool by the Premier League club.The club said in a statement that the Dutchman, 45, had ""agreed a deal to become the club's new head coach"" and would take up the position on June 1, subject to a work permit.Slot has been in charge of the Dutch team since 2021, and won the Eredivisie league title in 2022-23 along with the KNVB Cup this season, while Feyenoord also reached the Europa Conference League final in his first season at the club.Klopp announced in January that he would leave Liverpool at the end of this season and, after much speculation, Slot confirmed on Friday that he would become Liverpool manager.On Sunday, after Liverpool's final game of the season, a 2-0 home win over Wolverhampton Wanderers, Klopp led the Anfield crowd in a song for the incoming manager.Slot was linked with the Tottenham Hotspur job at the end of last season before signing a contract extension at Feyenoord, and his aggressive, attacking style attracted Liverpool to entice the Dutchman to the Premier League.Liverpool ended the season third in the Premier League, nine points off champions Manchester City, while Feyenoord finished runners-up to PSV Eindhoven in the Eredivisie.Slot was given a rousing send-off by the Feyenoord fans after their final league game of the season on Sunday, a 4-0 home win over Excelsior, as the 45-year-old's three-year spell at the club came to an end.This season, Feyenoord were denied a repeat of their title win only by an impressive PSV, who have lost once, while Feyenoord have suffered defeat twice, the same as last term, to finish nine points of the pace.Slot's success and entertaining brand of football has previously attracted interest from English clubs, including Crystal Palace and Leeds United, before Spurs tried to persuade him to join them at the end of last season.He decided to remain at Feyenoord, extending his contract, but the approach from Liverpool proved irresistible, and Slot will now have the tough task of replacing the much-loved Klopp who leaves after nine years at the club.","Former Feyenoord coach Arne Slot confirmed as Jurgen Klopp's successor at Liverpool.

NEW DELHI: Kylian Mbappe was conspicuously absent as the newly-crowned Ligue 1 champions Paris Saint-Germain concluded their triumphant campaign with a convincing 2-0 victory against the embattled Metz on Sunday.The prolific striker, who is poised to bid adieu to PSG after an illustrious seven-year stint, had already been sidelined during his team's hard-fought 2-1 win at Nice earlier in the week due to a nagging hamstring injury.Mbappe opted not to accompany his teammates on their journey to Metz and was among a handful of key first-team players who were given a well-deserved respite by coach Luis Enrique , with the title already safely in their grasp.Ousmane Dembele , Gianluigi Donnarumma, Marquinhos, and Vitinha were also notable absentees, but PSG still managed to secure the win courtesy of early strikes from Carlos Soler and Lee Kang-in.Despite his absence, Mbappe is widely anticipated to feature in his swan song for PSG in the upcoming French Cup final against Lyon next week, before his much-touted move to Real Madrid for the forthcoming season.Notwithstanding the setback, Metz still harbour hopes of preserving their top-flight status. They find themselves in the relegation play-off spot at the end of the season, edging out Lorient by virtue of having scored more away goals in their head-to-head encounters.Lorient's resounding 5-0 triumph over Clermont saw them finish level with Metz on both points and goal difference, but the Brittany-based outfit will be consigned to Ligue 2, while Metz will have a second bite at the cherry to ensure their survival.","Kylian Mbappe missed Paris Saint-Germain's 2-0 win against Metz.

NEW DELHI: Barcelona secured a resounding 3-0 victory over Rayo Vallecano in their final home fixture of LaLiga 2023/24 season on Sunday, cementing their second-place position in the Spanish league table.The triumph was orchestrated by an early strike from prolific marksman Robert Lewandowski and a rapid-fire brace from the prodigious midfielder Pedri .The outcome propelled Barcelona's point tally to 82, establishing a four-point buffer over third-placed Girona, who emerged victorious with a 3-1 away win at Valencia.Newly-crowned champions Real Madrid sit comfortably atop the standings, holding a 12-point advantage over Barcelona with a solitary round of matches remaining.Barcelona seized the initiative in the third minute when the precocious Lamine Yamal embarked on a mesmerizing run from the right flank, deftly chipping the ball towards Lewandowski. The Polish striker exhibited his elite technical prowess, adroitly controlling the pass with his chest before unleashing an unstoppable volley into the net.Despite Rayo's valiant efforts to restore parity, Barcelona extended their lead courtesy of a moment of individual brilliance from Joao Felix. The Portuguese maestro's initial attempt was thwarted by the goalkeeper, but the opportunistic Pedri pounced on the rebound to provide the hosts with a two-goal cushion.A mere three minutes later, Pedri's tactical acumen came to the fore as he astutely exploited a vulnerability in Rayo's high defensive line. The 21-year-old midfielder latched onto a precise long ball from stalwart centre-back Ronald Araujo, calmly slotting home to double his goal tally for the campaign.Barcelona will conclude their season with an away encounter against Sevilla next weekend, while 16th-placed Rayo are set to host Athletic Bilbao in their final outing.","Barcelona secured a resounding 3-0 victory over Rayo Vallecano in their final home fixture of LaLiga 2023/24 season.
