‘It's not baigan’: TMC mocks sports minister Mandaviya over Mohun Bagan faux pas — video,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/its-not-baigan-tmc-mocks-sports-minister-mandaviya-over-mohun-bagan-faux-pas-video/articleshow/126393949.cms,"Union Minister Mansukh Mandaviya (ANI photo/File)

NEW DELHI: The ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) in poll-bound West Bengal mocked Union sports minister Mansukh Mandaviya after he mispronounced the name of Kolkata-based football club Mohun Bagan during a press conference.In the clip, Mandaviya was seen struggling to pronounce “Mohun Bagan” correctly, eventually uttering a word that sounded like “baigan”, the Hindi term for eggplant. The mispronunciation quickly became the subject of online trolling.West Bengal’s ruling party, the Trinamool Congress (TMC), on Wednesday also reacted to the clip, using it to mock the Union minister and point out the error in his pronunciation.""The Union Sports Minister has, once again, revealed the deep-seated contempt the BJP harbours towards Bengal. He mangled the names of our most revered football institutions, referring to the legendary Mohun Bagan as ""Mohan baigan"" and the iconic East Bengal as ""East baigan"".The party further wrote: ""For Bengalis, Mohun Bagan and East Bengal are symbols of identity and pride. We have lived and breathed this beautiful game for over a century, celebrating victories with the same fervor as festivals and mourning defeats as personal loss.""Accusing the rival BJP of viewing Bengal through the ""lens of Bangla-Birodhi arrogance"", the TMC claimed that for the saffron party, anything associated with Bengal ""merits only mockery and dismissal.""""Yet, those who view Bengal through the lens of Bangla-Birodhi arrogance cannot even extend the basic courtesy of pronouncing these sacred names correctly. Why would they? In their eyes, anything associated with Bengal merits only mockery and dismissal,"" the TMC wrote on X.Mansukh Mandaviya on Tuesday said that the Indian Super League (ISL) will start from February 14. The minister also noted that all 14 clubs have agreed to play the ISL this season.""We have decided that the ISL will start on February 14, Saturday, and all of our clubs will participate in it,"" Mansukh Mandaviya told the reporters.""In the country, football has progressed.

My Two Cents on This Mock Trade





The Los Angeles Dodgers are being closely linked to Bo Bichette as free agency approaches. People around the league believe the Dodgers are willing to wait. The idea is simple: let the market settle, then step in with an offer that favors a shorter term and a higher yearly salary.Toronto’s chances of keeping Bichette appear to be shrinking. While a return is still possible, there is growing belief that Los Angeles sees an opening. The Los Angeles Dodgers have payroll flexibility, a clear plan, and a roster built to win now. That combination makes them a serious threat if Bichette reaches the open market without a deal in place.Most projections place Bo Bichette’s value between seven and eight years, with a total price of $200–210 million. That comes out to roughly $26 million per season. The Los Angeles Dodgers are not known for committing to long contracts unless the fit is perfect. Instead, they often prefer shorter deals that keep future options open.A four- or five-year contract with a higher annual value fits their pattern. There has been little noise about trade talks, which points to this being a free-agent play. Bichette has also indicated he is open to playing second base.That matters because Mookie Betts is expected to remain the Dodgers’ shortstop in 2026. One possible structure discussed around the league is an eight-year, $200 million deal with a fourth-year opt-out and front-loaded money to limit long-term risk.For the Los Angeles Dodgers, Bichette adds a right-handed bat to a lineup already built around Shohei Ohtani and Freddie Freeman. His ability to hit for average and drive in runs strengthens the middle of the order during another title push.For Bichette, a move would mean leaving a team in transition with the Toronto Blue Jays and joining a consistent contender. He would hit with protection and play meaningful games deep into October. Toronto, if he leaves after rejecting a qualifying offer, would receive draft pick compensation and free up money to focus on younger players.Bichette is 27 years old, born March 5, 1998. Over 748 career games, he owns a .294/.342/.462 slash line with 111 home runs. In 2025, he hit .311, one of the best averages in the American League.Defense remains the concern. His metrics at shortstop have been negative throughout his career, including continued struggles in 2025. A move to second base helps, but his glove still lowers his overall value.Also read: MLB trade rumors: Toronto Blue Jays on the verge of singning $500 million Chicago Cubs superstar to get much-needed roster upgrade The Dodgers are in a strong position. Bichette fills a clear need without forcing changes elsewhere, and his bat raises the ceiling of an already elite lineup. Toronto may gain future assets, but Los Angeles gains a player who fits their timeline and their approach to winning now.","The Los Angeles Dodgers are being closely linked to Bo Bichette as free agency approaches.

Kevin Love showers praise for LeBron James' basketball IQ



Kevin Love Talks LeBron & Kyrie, the Importance of NBA Vets, and More

Kevin Love on LeBron James as a lifelong student of the game







Kevin Love spent four defining seasons alongside LeBron James in Cleveland, sharing locker rooms, practices, playoff pressure, and, of course, wins. Those years gave Love a front-row seat to habits few teammates ever see. Long after their championship run, Love still speaks about what separated James from everyone else he played with.Love revisited his experiences during a recent appearance on The Old Man and the Three podcast. When he was asked to name the smartest player of his career, he answered LeBron’s name without hesitation.Kevin Love explained that James treated every moment as a learning window. “In shootaround or even out there on the floor, he could do every team’s scout. He knew every team’s play, he knew every guy’s tendency. He watched endless amounts of basketball… It’s a true gift,” Love said at the 23:50 mark. “In terms of basketball, he does have a photographic type memory. That’s not normal… It’s a hack when the best player in the world, a 6’9” 260 LB freight train, is setting the tone in that way. ”James’ basketball strategies helped Cleveland’s run to four straight NBA Finals from 2015 to 2018.Love and James helped deliver the franchise’s first championship in 2016, a title built on trust and execution. Love averaged 15.7 points and 9.2 rebounds across 489 games with the Cavaliers, earning two All-Star selections during that span.James’ awareness often extended beyond his own team. Opponents have recalled moments when he called out their sets before plays unfolded. Love pointed to press conferences where James could recount long sequences with precision, down to positioning and game context, reinforcing how deeply he processed the sport.Their partnership was not without strain. A 2015 tweet from James addressed team accountability and later became a public talking point. Love has since acknowledged the moment stung. The bond between the duo also shines till date. James attended Love’s wedding in 2022, and they often share moments off the court.Today, both players are with different teams. James still performs at a high level with the Los Angeles Lakers at age 41. Love contributes veteran leadership and shooting with the Utah Jazz. However, Love’s view of his former teammate is still the same.Also Read: Los Angeles Lakers head coach JJ Redick comments on coaching LeBron James: ""Sometimes he tells me to F off...and he's right""",Kevin Love spent four seasons with LeBron James in Cleveland.

Sydney Warner welcomes baby girl and shares intimate family moments







Sydney Warner welcomes baby girl and begins a new chapter that blends quiet faith, family rhythm, and a moment of pause from the roar of football life. The announcement arrived without a date or drama, just warmth and certainty. A household that already knew joy with son Beau now opens its arms to Bella Nicole, a name that feels both tender and grounded.The first images told the story better than any headline. Hospital hallways. Soft light. A blue “Big Brother” hat perched proudly on Beau’s head. Fred Warner’s smile said everything, even as his season waits in uncertainty. The couple let the moment breathe, offering gratitude and calm instead of spectacle. In a world that moves fast, they chose stillness.The parents shared the news with a simple caption that carried weight and faith. “Thankful for God’s protection, strength, and the countless prayers that carried us through her early days,” the message read. “We are finally home and family of four!✨.” The words felt earned, not polished. They spoke to long nights, steady hope, and the relief that comes only after worry passes.Sydney’s photos followed a gentle arc. There were quiet shots before labor, Fred holding Beau close, and the first cuddles with Bella Nicole. A bassinet framed by pink florals. A monogram stitched with care. One image captured Fred beside the hospital bed, another showed him walking the halls as Bella rested. Sydney also shared a moment many new mothers recognize, matching pajamas with her daughter and the honest note, “will never forget these walks back and forth every 3 hours to feed my girl. ”The journey had unfolded in pieces over the past year. In September 2025, Sydney revealed her pregnancy during a picnic scene with ultrasound photos and Beau nearby. “Baby Warner #2 coming 2026,” she wrote, later adding, “Living the best days of our lives.” By December, her tone softened further. “Life has been moving slow lately ♥️ and I love it. Soaking it all up before a new member joins the fam.” Fred answered with joy. “My babiessssss!!❤️❤️❤️”.While Fred rehabs from a severe ankle injury suffered in October, football fades to the background.

Kara Bieber ’s reaction brings added attention to Taylor Gausman’s offseason post





The offseason in baseball usually offers the chance to see things that are less refined and more personal and that was what happened when the wife of Kevin Gausman, Taylor Gausman, posted a sequence of casual vacation photos on Instagram. The photos showed the couple taking a relaxing time off without the crowded stadiums and demanding schedules with the sun, sand and relaxed feeling of being together.Even though the post immediately attracted appreciations among fans, this increased its reach when a voice of the baseball community entered the discussion. The most straightforward response in the comments provided some human element and made the response to a post of an offseason a dialogue between the whole MLB community.With thousands of likes and comments, one of the most prominent ones was received by Kara Bieber, the wife of Blue Jays pitcher Shane Bieber who made a response that was somewhat sarcastic and playful. In response to the photos of Taylor, Kara wrote, “does it gets better looking idk.” The line was friendly, admiring, and instantly the one notices it, as there is the sense of easy camaraderie that usually prevails among the families of players.What was appealing in the exchange was its authenticity. It was not about promotion or performance but simply a natural response to a moment which seemed to be authentic. Taylor gave a peaceful visual of what life was like without the hectic pace of baseball, and Kara’s comment was an easily identifiable lighthearted commentary that all fans love to watch during off-season.In the case of Kevin Gausman, a steady presence in the Toronto Blue Jays rotation, the moment was characterized by balance and not attention. It was a reminder to the followers that even during the off season, little and genuine interactions can go a long way. Even one post and an honest comment are sometimes enough to make a conversation across the baseball world, especially during the offseason when fans crave authentic moments beyond the game and and feel closer to players’ personal lives.","Taylor Gausman posted a series of vacation photos on Instagram.

MLB trade rumours: Cody Bellinger seeks six- or seven-year contract while New York Yankees prefer shorter commitment,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/mlb/news/mlb-trade-rumours-cody-bellinger-seeks-six-or-seven-year-contract-while-new-york-yankees-prefer-shorter-commitment/articleshow/126405204.cms,"(Image Source - Getty Images)

Cody Bellinger and the New York Yankees exchange multiple offers

Cody Bellinger enters his age-30 season with most teams projecting a five- or six-year deal

Interest from other teams for Cody Bellinger





The New York Yankees are in talks with free agent outfielder Cody Bellinger during the 2025-2026 offseason, and the length of the contract is a major sticking point. It seems like they’re not close to a deal yet, but discussions are still ongoing. Bellinger and his agents at the Boras Corporation are probably aiming for a six- or seven-year contract.In a different segment on MLB Network, Jon Morosi mentioned that Bellinger is still looking for a deal around seven years, while the Yankees, as expected, are leaning towards a four- or five-year agreement. This deadlock comes as reports indicate that the Yankees have made at least two formal offers to Bellinger. General manager Brian Cashman has openly shown the team's desire to bring him back.Talks between Bellinger and the Yankees have moved forward with several offers on the table, but they still can’t agree on the contract length. Brendan Kuty mentioned in The Athletic that the length of the contract might be a sticking point, as Bellinger is looking for a deal of six or seven years. Jon Morosi also chimed in on MLB Network's Hot Stove, stating, ""I still in the long-run think Bellinger ends up a Yankee,"" while noting the back-and-forth discussions.Steve Phillips, also on MLB Network, reacted to the second offer by stating, “There's some back-and-forth which is a good sign for the Yankees... I still in the long-run think Bellinger ends up a Yankee.” Bryan Hoch, via SNYtv, reported, ""What I'm told is that there is a gap and it's years and AAV,” referring to average annual value as factors holding up the deal.Robert Murray mentioned that the Yankees and Bellinger aren't really close to making a deal, but New York is still the top contender to sign him. Jon Heyman talked about Bellinger's situation and other Yankees-related topics during a chat on Michael Kay's show that was shared on X.External forecasts give insight into the anticipated duration and worth of the deal. MLB Trade Rumors estimated that Bellinger would land a five-year, $140MM contract at the beginning of the offseason. Most predictions indicate a five- or six-year agreement, as Bellinger approaches his 30th birthday.There’s a history of players landing contracts of seven years or more at that age, but the last free agent hitter to achieve this was Brandon Nimmo in 2022. Since then, no free agent bat in his 30s has signed a six-year deal, although Alex Bregman turned down a six-year proposal from the Tigers last winter when he was a year older.Bobby Milone on X noted, ""Boras wants 7 years"" is correct (no one giving him that). I heard 30-32m was the max (Doubt anyone giving more). So 5/150-160m is the sweet spot and the Yankees are not there (Cause I doubt any other team is bidding).""Roman Savino replied on X, ""I admire Boras for thinking Cody could get 30-32m but last year the Cubs had to pay 5m to be able to trade him. Cody and Boras need to start to be realistic about what his market actually is.""Although the Yankees are leading the pack, other teams are also in the mix for Bellinger. The New York Mets have been frequently brought up. There's even talk about a potential reunion with the Cubs.There's a noticeable difference between what Bellinger wants and what teams are offering, with several reports saying he's looking for a deal of six or seven years.Considering the Yankees' offseason, Bellinger's negotiations might be affecting other decisions, like possible trades for starting pitchers such as Freddy Peralta or MacKenzie Gore, as Bobby Milone hinted on X, ""The holdup for Peralta or Gore might be Bellinger. As the Brewers and Nationals might want Dominguez or Jones in a deal. If Bellinger gets done, we could see quickly after a trade for a SP.""Jack Fungo on X added, ""I think they’re pressing to resolve the Bellinger situation first before engaging on the SP market.""The Yankees decided to give Trent Grisham a qualifying offer, which changed their compensation pick because of luxury tax rules. This move is linked to their negotiations with Bellinger, but they haven't come to an agreement yet, though talks are still ongoing.Also Read: Who is Reagan Bregman?

Chelsea's defeat to Fulham sparks backlash toward Pedro Neto



Liam Rosenior’s Chelsea era begins with a devastating loss







Chelsea’s turbulent season took another huge blow at Craven Cottage as a 2–1 defeat to Fulham triggered fury among travelling supporters. Fans shared their frustrations as the match was marred by ill discipline, defensive lapses, and missed chances, which ended with chants aimed at the club’s hierarchy and growing anger toward individual performances.The loss came on a night when Chelsea again struggled to keep control. Marc Cucurella’s first-half red card left the visitors chasing the game. Fulham made their numerical advantage count. While Liam Delap briefly restored hope with his first Premier League goal for the club, the evening ended in frustration. One player, however, became the main focus of fan backlash, and it was none other than Pedro Neto.Pedro Neto found himself at the center of supporters’ anger following another difficult game. The Portuguese winger has endured a challenging run of form. Social media reaction was swift and unforgiving as fans questioned his role in the starting lineup.“Neto is so useless bro,” one supporter wrote on X.Another added, “Garnacho and Estavao should start instead of Neto and Palmer.” The criticism continued to mount as frustrations spilled across timelines. “I don’t understand how Pedro Neto has 0 skill moves, like not one time have I ever seen him skill past a player.I pray Rosenior moves on from him,” another post read.Others took an even harsher tone. “You’re embarrassing. Get Tosin and Neto out of my club,” a fan wrote.Another summed up the mood with, “It’s always gonna be defeat as far as Neto plays in Chelsea. Never seen a winger that can’t beat 1 defender.”On the pitch, Chelsea showed brief resolve. Raul Jimenez had given Fulham the lead early in the second half before Neto’s corner caused chaos in the box, leading to Delap’s equalizer. Harry Wilson’s late winner ensured the frustration lingered long after full-time.The match also served as an unwanted introduction for new head coach Liam Rosenior, who watched from the stands. He inherits a side with one win in nine league matches and a discipline problem that continues to define Chelsea’s campaign.Despite the anger, there remains a sense of transition around the club. Former Chelsea winger Paul Canoville urged unity following Rosenior’s appointment. “Liam Rosenior is a quality coach who knows the game inside out, and that's what matters most,” Canoville said. “So yes, it is a massive moment for the club, for London, for every young person dreaming big. But right now? Let's back Liam, give him what he needs, and let the man do his work. ”Now, Chelsea’s problems feel big and unresolved. The team must show brilliance with Rosenior in a new dawn.Also Read: Freddie Freeman and Chelsea Freeman combined net worth: MLB star earnings, business work, and their life together","Chelsea's defeat to Fulham sparks backlash toward Pedro Neto.

Bangladesh seek T20 WC match shift from India after Mustafizur Rahman's IPL exit

Willow by Cricbuzz





West Indies all-rounder Jason Holder has weighed in on the India–Pakistan rivalry following the Asia Cup 2025, calling out what he described as excessive on-field theatrics and expressing disappointment over how events unfolded.The Asia Cup once again showcased why clashes between India and Pakistan remain cricket’s most intense rivalry. While the contest has always been charged with emotion and history, the 2025 edition went beyond the 22 yards, with off-field drama capturing almost as much attention as the cricket itself.India lifted the Asia Cup after defeating Pakistan by five wickets in the final, extending their dominance over their arch-rivals in multi-team tournaments. Yet, the post-match scenes drew widespread debate when Indian players chose not to collect the trophy from PCB chairman Mohsin Naqvi, amid the backdrop of the Pahalgam attack and Operation Sindoor . Naqvi eventually took the trophy back, resulting in India returning home without the trophy despite their victory.Speaking on thepodcast, Holder was candid about his discomfort with the situation. “I don’t like the India–Pakistan beef. I saw India win the Asia Cup and they didn’t go to accept the trophy. It’s just too much, man,” he said.Holder then broadened the discussion, offering his perspective on how politics and ownership dynamics have influenced franchise cricket. He noted the limited opportunities for Pakistani players in T20 leagues, especially those owned by Indian stakeholders.“Certain Pakistanis can’t be involved in certain teams because they’re owned by Indian owners. It’s just sad, man,” he added.The former West Indies captain stressed the influence top cricketers wield beyond results. “If you’re inspiring a generation and inspiring the world, then we have to find a way to come together,” Holder said. While acknowledging the long political history between the two nations, he believes cricket can still be a starting point for change. “I understand how big this rivalry is off the field,” he noted. “But if change is going to happen, it can start on the cricket field. A way to soften things is by India and Pakistan coming together through sport.”Holder sees potential for sport to influence life beyond cricket. “If it’s possible at a sporting level, maybe it becomes possible in everyday life too,” he said. “Stopping the fighting and tension would be huge.” He also spoke about the cultural impact of athletes as role models: “There’s always a trickle-down effect. When people see their heroes behaving a certain way, it influences them. That’s why it’s sad to see this play out. ”Despite the tensions, Holder emphasised his respect for both nations. “They’re beautiful countries with incredible people and cultures,” he said. “That’s why moments like this hurt everyone who loves cricket.” He concluded with a call to uphold the spirit of the game: “We talk about unity and growing the game. So let’s practise what we preach — bring cricket together and build healthier relationships.”India and Pakistan have not played a bilateral series for several years, making ICC and ACC events the only stages where the rivalry now unfolds. Asia Cup 2025 saw the two sides clash three times, including the final, keeping the spotlight firmly on the rivalry throughout the tournament.","Jason Holder criticises on-field theatrics following the Asia Cup 2025.

Wild-card weekend introduces urgency and contrasting paths





The 2025 regular season of the National Football League came to an end with the playoff picture fully settled and no loose ends left behind. All 14 postseason teams are officially confirmed, first-round byes have been awarded, and the wild-card matchups are locked in ahead of the opening weekend. While much of the field had already been decided entering Week 18, the final slate of games played a defining role in shaping the bracket.Division races were finalized, seeding battles were resolved, and the path each team must take toward Super Bowl LX became clear.

Denver finished with the best record in the AFC, earning the conference’s No. 1 seed and the lone first-round bye. That advantage provides additional rest and ensures the Broncos will host their divisional-round matchup against the lowest remaining seed.Seattle claimed a similar edge in the NFC. A decisive late-season win locked up the No. 1 seed, allowing the Seahawks to skip the wild-card round entirely. With several contenders entering the postseason managing injuries and short recovery windows, Seattle’s extra week could be a critical factor as the bracket tightens.The opening round of the postseason brings immediate pressure for division winners and opportunity for wild-card teams playing with little to lose. Carolina’s presence stands out, as the Panthers reached the playoffs despite finishing the regular season below .500, joining a rare group in league history.Elsewhere, experienced road teams such as the Rams and Bills enter hostile environments knowing that a single mistake could end their season. Several matchups also place younger quarterbacks under the spotlight, adding another layer of intrigue to the opening weekend.Wild-card weekend kicks off January 10, followed by the divisional round on January 17–18 and the conference championships on January 25. The season will conclude with Super Bowl 60 on February 8 at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara. From this point forward, regular-season records offer no protection.

Sanoe Ramirez net worth remains private and undisclosed

The combined net worth of Hanley Ramirez and Sanoe Ramirez





Former MLB star Hanley Ramirez has over ten years of his life being among the most recognizable faces in baseball, with the ability to match with talent and the right contracts at the right time that characterized a period. His career was played under the spotlight of the stage yet the basis of his success was constant and discreet. Hanley and his wife, Sanoe (Elisabeth) Ramirez constructed a family-first world that was neither too famous nor too normal.The couple has been drifting into a more muted phase since abandoning the game, defined by the long-term thinking, common interests, and a calculated lack of the never-ending focus. Their performance is not the only reason that has seen their financial narrative; their financial narrative is based on how they negotiated transitions before, during and after baseball.With a 14-year career in the Major League Baseball, Hanley Ramirez has an estimated net worth of about $50 million. The seasons of breakthrough and high performance with Miami Marlins made him one of the most complete hitters in the league, which resulted in major long-term contracts. Subsequent seasons with the Boston Red Sox, Los Angeles Dodgers and the Cleveland Indians brought on board veteran contracts that fortified his overall incomes.Appearances and after season exposure also added to his economic position.Sanoe Ramirez has avoided the limelight so much that she has not revealed her finances, unlike many other wives of professional athletes. No confirmed or publicly accessible information is given on her personal net worth. She has always kept a low profile option, including family life and staying stable in the face of the high profile sports career and its aftermath.Since the personal finances of Sanoe Ramirez are confidential, the joint net worth of the couple is usually pegged on the estimated fortune of Hanley Ramirez, which is around $50 million. They all share assets, long term planning and family approach to life off the field. The marriage has three kids and being brought up in an environment that is not under constant observation has influenced most of the post-retirement decisions. In the present age, Hanley has creative hobbies and likes music and DJing and is still associated with long-term friends such as David Ortiz, implying a successful, loyal and life after the game.","Former MLB star Hanley Ramirez has over ten years of his life being among the most recognizable faces in baseball.

Jets defenseman Haydn Fleury hospitalized after first-period hit from Keegan Kolesar





Winnipeg Jets defenseman Haydn Fleury suffered a frightening injury early Tuesday night, leaving the ice on a stretcher during a 4-3 overtime loss to the Vegas Golden Knights at Canada Life Centre. The incident cast a long shadow over the game, shifting focus away from the result and toward player safety.The hit occurred in the first period and brought an immediate hush over the building, as teammates and medical staff quickly realized the seriousness of the situation.The injury happened at the 13:16 mark of the opening period as Fleury attempted to clear the puck from his defensive zone. Golden Knights forward Keegan Kolesar made contact as Fleury crossed over near the end boards, sending the Jets blueliner sliding awkwardly into the wall. Fleury’s head and upper body absorbed most of the impact, prompting an immediate stoppage as trainers rushed to his side.Fleury remained down on the ice for several minutes before being carefully placed on a stretcher and transported off. No penalty was assessed on the play, a decision that drew quiet scrutiny but little immediate protest, given the concern surrounding Fleury’s condition.After the game, Jets head coach Scott Arniel described the sequence as an unfortunate convergence of timing and positioning rather than a malicious play.Arniel noted that Kolesar was not directly on top of Fleury, but the defenseman lost balance while crossing over, which led to the violent collision with the boards. The coach acknowledged how unsettling the moment was, calling it a “scary situation” that no one wants to see.Arniel confirmed that Fleury stayed overnight in the hospital for further evaluation. The defenseman suffered a broken nose, along with injuries affecting his head, neck, and back. According to the Jets, Fleury is undergoing a series of tests to determine the full extent of the damage, with no immediate timeline provided for his return.From a hockey standpoint, Fleury has yet to record a point in 17 games this season for Winnipeg, but his role has gone beyond the scoresheet. He has provided depth on the blue line during a challenging campaign for the Jets, who now sit at 15-21-5.For Winnipeg, the loss to Vegas became secondary. The immediate concern remains Haydn Fleury’s health and recovery, a reminder of how quickly a routine play can turn dangerous in the NHL, and how fragile the line is between competition and risk.","Jets defenseman Haydn Fleury hospitalized after first-period hit from Keegan Kolesar.

‘ Rage baiting Indians,’ Nalin Haley boasts





A social media clash involving Vivek Ramaswamy and Nalin Haley, the son of former UN ambassador and Republican leader Nikki Haley , has ignited backlash online after Nalin openly bragged about provoking racist responses while taking aim at the Indian-American politician.The controversy erupted after Ramaswamy announced that he was stepping back from social media, a move that quickly became fodder for critics on the American right, including Haley’s son.Ramaswamy said the hostility he faced online had reached a breaking point, prompting him to quit social media platforms personally. In a Wall Street Journal opinion piece, the former DOGE leader wrote that he deleted X and Instagram from his phone on New Year’s Eve.“I’ll spend my newfound time listening to more voters in real-world Ohio, developing more policies to make our state affordable, and being more present with my family,” he wrote.Ramaswamy added that while his campaign team would continue using social media to distribute messages, he himself would stop scrolling through posts. He described social media as “a tempting alternative” to costly polling but warned that it often distorts reality.“The messages you’re most likely to see are the most negative and bombastic,” he wrote. Ramaswamy also said online commentary is largely shaped by bots and foreign actors, which can mislead politicians about what real voters think.The decision drew attention because it appeared to contradict Ramaswamy’s own earlier rhetoric. In a previous post that resurfaced widely, he had written: “If you’re scared of your comment section, you are not fit to lead.”Nalin Haley seized on that contradiction. In a post on X, he shared screenshots of Ramaswamy’s old comment alongside the Wall Street Journal op-ed announcing his withdrawal from social media.“If you’re wondering why the emoji is white now it’s cuz there’s a random intern on the other side of the screen Vifake Ramaslimey said just a few weeks ago that if you can’t handle mean words on a screen you can’t govern. For once he’s right and should take his own advice,” Nalin wrote.The post quickly went viral, triggering a flood of replies, some amused, others sharply critical, many of which focused on Nalin Haley’s language and personal attacks.As the comment section filled up, one user replied to Nalin Haley with a racist remark: “You will be deported back to India.” Rather than distancing himself from the comment, Nalin responded by embracing the controversy.“My all time favorite hobby is rage baiting Indians and Leftists into being racist. Never gets old,” he wrote. The remark drew fresh outrage, with critics accusing him of deliberately encouraging racist abuse for engagement, while supporters framed it as trolling political opponents.","Vivek Ramaswamy, an Indian-American politician, announced he was stepping back from social media.

Understanding “Der Al Sittin”

Current weather

Fog and reduced visibility have been reported in parts of Abu Dhabi and other inland areas, prompting caution for drivers and commuters.



Light rain and cloudy skies are possible in coastal emirates like Sharjah, Ras Al Khaimah, and Fujairah over the next few days, reflecting unsettled winter conditions.



Temperatures in cities such as Dubai and Abu Dhabi are dipping into the mid-teens at night — noticeably cooler than recent weeks.



Super ‘ Wolf Moon ’





If you thought the winter breeze was already crisp, it’s time to dig even deeper into your wardrobe. According to the latest forecasts from the National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) and the Emirates Astronomical Society, the UAE is about to enter its most intense cold spell of the year.This period, which runs from January 10 to January 22, is historically recognized as the peak of the winter season, where the mercury takes its most dramatic dip.Experts like Ibrahim Al Jarwan, Chairman of the Emirates Astronomical Society, explain that this isn't just a random weather shift.It is a well-documented phenomenon that combines ancient regional folklore with modern atmospheric science to bring a ""real"" winter experience to the desert.This upcoming cold spell is tied to a traditional phase known locally as “Der Al Sittin”, a weather pattern embedded in Gulf folklore and long associated with the chilliest days of the year.Der Al Sittin, literally “the sixty days”, is a traditional term used to describe a sustained period of cold weather that has been recognised by locals for generations. Folklore even describes this chill as sharp as a knife’s edge, highlighting just how intense winter mornings can feel during this time.Meteorologists link this period to both solar and atmospheric patterns, including the culmination of the Thuraya (Pleiades) constellation in the evening sky, an event historically connected with winter cold in Arab culture. This mix of cultural wisdom and scientific forecasting gives residents a familiar signal that winter’s peak is near.While daytime temperatures are expected to remain comfortable for most of the UAE, mornings and nights will feel significantly colder, especially before sunrise. Cool breezes and the possibility of frost in open desert regions are likely for those early hours.Before the main cold stretch arrives, weather patterns in the UAE are already showing signs of change:Despite these early signs, forecasters warn that weather predictions become less certain beyond about five days, due to the complexity of atmospheric dynamics. This means residents should keep an eye on regular updates closer to mid-January for the most accurate details.The upcoming cold snap isn't just happening on the ground; it’s being signaled from the stars. This period coincides with the evening culmination of the Thuraya (Pleiades) constellation, a star cluster that has long served as a celestial weather vane for Arab astronomers.When Thuraya reaches its peak in the evening sky, it traditionally signals that the most severe winter conditions have arrived.Adding to the drama of 2026, the first full moon of the year, known as the ""Wolf Moon"", is set to appear during this cold stretch.This year, it will be a supermoon, meaning the moon will be at its closest point to Earth, appearing unusually large and bright.While the name ""Wolf Moon"" comes from North American and European folklore, where wolves were said to howl more during the freezing winter nights, it perfectly sets the mood for the UAE’s own chilly January evenings.This winter stretch presents a chance for residents to experience one of the UAE’s traditional weather phases, a period locals have long recognised as the heart of winter. While the cold may be surprising to some, especially those used to milder months, it also offers a reminder of the seasonal rhythms that mark this part of the year in the Gulf region.","Temperatures in cities such as Dubai and Abu Dhabi are dipping into the mid- teens at night.

Ric Flair’s net worth in 2025 and what it reflects

Ric Flair’s wrestling career, earnings, and endorsements





Ric Flair is still one of the most famous names in the history of wrestling. Well into his post-ring prime decades later, the “Nature Boy” still draws eyes with appearances, branding agreements, and a seemingly never-ending coverage of his life and career. But as legendary as he is, Flair's net worth in 2025 paints a much more complex picture than many fans would expect.Years ago, Flair made millions when wrestling boomed, but behind the scenes, financial realities have changed his wealth. A combination of medical expenses, lifestyle spending, and failed business ventures. Combined, they tell the tale of why one of wrestling's all-time greats is often associated with a surprisingly small fortune in his name to this day.Ric Flair’s net worth in 2025 is reported at $500,000. That number is especially notable for a competitor who held world championships with various promotions and headlined dozens of major events. Thus, financial analysts and wrestling historians alike attribute this to a mixture of high personal expenses during his prime, numerous divorces, and huge medical expenses after a few health crises.Even Flair has been open about living the high life, which matched what fans saw on TV.We made this point before, that image solidified his spot in cultural history, but also boxed in his long-term wealth compared to some other big-name athletes who took a more traditional investment approach.Flashy Ric Flair character through NWA, WCW, and WWE, a 16-time world champion, and a two-time Hall of Famer. Flair made a great deal of money throughout his career from top payouts, television, merchandise, and advertising.His income increased after wrestling through endorsements and licensing deals. The guy's visage and catchphrases have graced clothing, collectibles, energy drinks, and pop culture crossovers. Of course, contracts back in the wrestling days sometimes restricted long-term royalties, so a great deal of those nostalgically iconic moments may not have earned the same continuously rolling money as fans might expect.Over the past several years, Flair has embraced brand-forward initiatives. They've ranged from restaurant concepts and cannabis partnerships to drink collaborations, all of which leverage his name for a new generation. In reality, a handful of projects picked up hype early on, while other projects deal with existential crises due to operational complexity or public outcry.Also Read: Bron Breakker and Izzy Dame combined net worth: WWE contracts, endorsements, brand deals, and more","Ric Flair’s net worth in 2025 is reported at $500,000.

Anthony Duclair’s quick hat trick becomes a key reason for Islanders’ dominance against Devils







Anthony Duclair also had an impressive night for the Islanders on Tuesday, scoring three goals to help the team beat the New Jersey Devils 4-0. Entering the game with just four goals in 39 appearances this season, Duclair’s three-goal effort was both unexpected and decisive, giving the Islanders a commanding lead early in the contest.Duclair had not played in the team’s previous two games and entered Tuesday night averaging only 12:58 of ice time per game. His scoring pace this season, roughly one goal every ten games, made his impact against the Devils particularly striking. Despite limited minutes and a modest role on the roster, he found the back of the net three times in just over 23 minutes of ice time.The first goal came 4:01 into the first period, marking Duclair’s first score since December 2 and his 12th goal in 84 games with the Islanders. Less than ten minutes later, he scored again, recording his first multi-goal game since March 2024. Duclair completed the hat trick 3:29 into the second period, finishing three goals in a combined game time of 23:29.Measured against his season averages, Duclair’s scoring efficiency against the Devils was extraordinary. He normally scores a goal every 126.4 minutes on ice, but Tuesday’s performance significantly exceeded that rate.Each goal came in quick succession, demonstrating his ability to convert scoring opportunities during limited ice time.The hat trick also contributed to the Islanders’ overall control of the game. With a 4-0 lead established early, the team maintained dominance through all three periods. Duclair’s goals were critical in extending the lead and keeping the Devils off the scoreboard throughout the contest.Duclair’s performance underscores the potential impact of players in depth roles who can contribute when given opportunities. The hat trick not only improved his personal statistics but also strengthened the Islanders’ position in the standings. As the 2025-26 NHL season progresses, contributions like these may play a significant role in determining team outcomes in tight matchups.Anthony Duclair’s hat trick against New Jersey stands out as one of the most improbable scoring efforts of the season, achieved in limited ice time and against a divisional opponent. This performance highlights his ability to deliver decisive results when on the ice.","Anthony Duclair scored three goals to help the Islanders beat the New Jersey Devils 4-0.

Usman Khawaja's retirement speech: 'I want the journey for the next Usman Khawaja to be easier'





Former England cricketer David Gower lavished praise on 22-year-old Jacob Bethell after the England batter struck his maiden First-Class century on Day 4 of the ongoing fifth Ashes Test against Australia at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Wednesday. Bethell produced a superb unbeaten 142 off 232 balls, laced with 15 fours, to help England build a crucial 119-run lead in their second innings in reply to Australia’s imposing first-innings total of 567.""Bethell. Brilliant. Delighted. Nuff said!"" Gower wrote on X.Former England captain Michael Vaughan also took to X to applaud Bethell’s technique, adding that the youngster’s innings should serve as a template for England’s Test batters going forward.""A star has been born here at the SCG .. The tempo / Technique and class of Jacob Bethell today is the blueprint for England's future Test batters,"" Vaughan reposted.Bethell then backed up that praise with a flawless maiden Test century, anchoring England’s response as the visitors clawed their way back into the contest and edged into a slender 119-run lead, leaving the fifth and final Ashes Test finely poised. At stumps on Day 4 at the SCG, England were 302 for 8, with Bethell unbeaten on 142 and Matthew Potts yet to score.The left-hander’s knock proved vital after England suffered early setbacks, losing Zak Crawley cheaply and Joe Root soon after. Showing maturity beyond his years, Bethell brought up his hundred in style from 162 deliveries, remaining unfazed as wickets fell around him.Just two overs after Bethell reached three figures, Beau Webster swung the momentum Australia’s way with two wickets in three balls, removing Harry Brook for 42 and dismissing Will Jacks for a duck. England’s woes deepened further when Jamie Smith was run out for 24 following a costly mix-up.Ben Stokes, who had earlier limped off while bowling with what appeared to be a groin issue, came in at No. 7 but lasted only five balls before falling to Webster. England are chasing another morale-boosting victory after their Melbourne triumph, although Australia have already retained the Ashes with a 3-1 series lead.Remarkably, the hundred was Bethell’s first in both Test cricket and red-ball cricket overall, eclipsing his previous best of 96 against New Zealand. Recalled for the Melbourne Test in place of the struggling Ollie Pope, Bethell has further strengthened his hold on the No. 3 spot after also scoring a gritty 40 in difficult conditions.Earlier, Australia were bowled out for 567 before lunch, built around Travis Head’s 163 and a commanding 138 from captain Steve Smith, leaving England to overhaul a daunting first-innings deficit of 183 after being dismissed for 384.England’s reply began on a shaky note as Mitchell Starc struck in the first over, trapping Crawley lbw for one. Ben Duckett, dropped on 38, failed to make the most of the reprieve and was bowled by Michael Neser for 42. Root then endured a torrid stay before falling lbw to Scott Boland for six.Bethell, however, stood firm, taking England past Australia’s lead shortly after tea with a single off Neser and celebrating his hundred with a crisp boundary through midwicket. Webster’s late strikes tilted the momentum back in Australia’s favour, but Bethell’s resolve ensured the contest heads into the final day delicately balanced.",Jacob Bethell hits maiden Test century for England against Australia.

Early goals from Auston Matthews and Matthew Knies put Maple Leafs in control against Panthers







Auston Matthews continues to anchor the Toronto Maple Leafs’ push through a demanding stretch of the NHL season. On Tuesday night at Scotiabank Arena, the Maple Leafs delivered a composed 4-1 win over the Florida Panthers, leaning on structure, depth, and timely scoring to control the game.Matthews’ latest goal extended both a personal streak and Toronto’s recent surge, reinforcing why the Leafs’ captain remains central to their identity as the schedule tightens and the playoff picture sharpens.Matthews scored for the third straight game, finishing off a sharp second-period sequence to give Toronto a 3-0 cushion. The goal was his 422nd in the NHL , moving him further ahead as the leading goal-scorer in Maple Leafs history. More importantly for Toronto, it capped a stretch where Matthews had scored six goals over three games and earned points in five straight.The play itself reflected Toronto’s approach all night. Matthew Knies powered through traffic, absorbed contact from Niko Mikkola, and found Matthews in the slot, where the captain beat Sergei Bobrovsky cleanly. Knies later added a goal of his own and finished with a goal and an assist, continuing his steady rise in responsibility and impact.Toronto set the tone late in the first period when Easton Cowan opened the scoring off a feed from Nicholas Robertson, catching Florida out of structure. Just 42 seconds into the second, Knies doubled the lead with a deflection in the slot, and from there the Leafs controlled the pace. Joseph Woll was solid in goal, stopping 31 shots and handling rebounds efficiently as Florida tried to push back.Coach Craig Berube credited Toronto’s attention to detail, including puck battles, net-front coverage, and blocking shots, as the difference against a Panthers team built to grind. Toronto consistently won those battles, limiting Florida’s chances and keeping most shots to the outside.Florida’s lone goal came midway through the third when Carter Verhaeghe capitalized on a broken clearing attempt, but the Panthers never fully threatened a comeback. Brad Marchand exited late in the second period with an undisclosed injury, a precautionary decision according to coach Paul Maurice, who was openly critical of his team’s overall performance.The Maple Leafs closed the door by extending six-on-five before Bobby McMann sealed the result with an empty-net goal. Toronto has now gone 5-0-2 in its last seven games, with Auston Matthews’ scoring touch paired with a more complete and disciplined team effort that continues to yield results.Also Read: Auston Matthews honored in Maple Leafs pregame celebration after surpassing Mats Sundin as Toronto’s all-time leading goal scorer","Matthew Knies, Easton Cowan, and Bobby McMann scored in 4-1 win over Florida Panthers.

Bryce Young’s net worth in 2025 was widely estimated at $12 million, with Celebrity Net Worth listed as a primary source for that figure. That number is an estimate. But the money tied to Young’s rookie deal with the Carolina Panthers explains why the estimate keeps landing in the same place across outlets.Young entered the league as the No. 1 overall pick in the 2023 NFL Draft, and his rookie contract looks like what you would expect from that slot. He signed a four-year deal worth $37,955,071, and it came with a $24,603,688 signing bonus.Here is the part people miss when they talk net worth like it is just “salary.” That signing bonus is the heavy lift. It is why Young’s career cash ramped up fast, even though his year-to-year base salaries on a rookie deal are relatively small.By the end of the 2025 season, Over the Cap listed Young’s career earnings at $32,029,381. That is the cleanest public explanation for why a $12 million net worth estimate does not sound wild, even if you treat it as a rough snapshot and not a bank statement.Young’s rookie deal is fully guaranteed per the major contract trackers, and that matters because it removes the “if he sticks” part that usually hovers over early-career money.It also sets up the next step. Young’s contract includes the standard rookie timeline where the big leverage moment is not Year 1. It is the point where the Panthers decide whether he is the long-term plan, and whether he plays himself into extension talks.Young did not wait for Sundays to become a brand. ESPN reported during his Alabama days that he was already approaching major endorsement money, with Nick Saban publicly noting how quickly that side was moving.Once he turned pro, the brand list only got louder. Public reporting has tied Young to deals and partnerships connected to major names like Jordan Brand, Snickers, and BODYARMOR, with multiple outlets covering that early push around the 2023 draft window.Other reporting around Young’s portfolio has included brands such as Bojangles and Lowe’s Home Improvement, which fits the obvious playbook for a Panthers quarterback living in Charlotte, N.C.A lot of players do ads. Fewer build a public identity that is not only product-based. In 2025, local Charlotte reporting spotlighted Young spending an off day talking with teens about mental health at HopeWay.HopeWay also listed an event connected to the Young 9 Foundation, tying the philanthropy side directly to mental wellness fundraising. That kind of visibility does two things at once. It supports the community work, and it keeps Young in the public eye without needing a viral clip or a manufactured headline.Based on widely circulated public estimates, Bryce Young’s net worth in 2025 was $12 million.The better way to frame it is this: the estimate tracks because Young already had (1) a No. 1 pick rookie deal with a massive signing bonus and (2) a real endorsement runway that started before he ever took an NFL snap.","Based on widely circulated public estimates, Bryce Young’s net worth in 2025 was $12 million.

NHL Injury Update: Rutger McGroarty sidelined as Pittsburgh Penguins add young forward to injured reserve,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/nhl-injury-update-rutger-mcgroarty-sidelined-as-pittsburgh-penguins-add-young-forward-to-injured-reserve/articleshow/126399250.cms,"Rutger McGroarty (Image Via Getty Images)

What does Rutger McGroarty’s injury mean for Pittsburgh Penguins?







The Pittsburgh Penguins gave a rather alarming injury update on Wednesday morning, revealing that the forward Rutger McGroarty was put on injured reserve due to a concussion. Moreover, the club indicated that no return date had been set for the player, which seemed to suggest that McGroarty would be cautiously proceeding through the league’s concussion protocol.The team’s reliance on McGroarty, when their young players have been a significant factor in keeping the Penguins in the running in the congested Eastern Conference, is certainly a greater worry. Though the Penguins have dealt with injuries in the past, losing a player who has been developing as a forward like McGroarty poses a challenge that the team has to face as it gears up for a hectic schedule of games.In the 2022 NHL Draft, the Winnipeg Jets picked Rutger McGroarty at number 14. He was then traded to the Penguins in August 2024 as part of a deal that included Brayden Yager going to Winnipeg. Since McGroarty was traded to the Penguins, he has been considered to be a significant contributor in the long-term plans of the organization under the guidance of GM Kyle Dubas and head coach Dan Muse.McGroarty has played 16 matches at the NHL level this season, where he scored two goals and one assist, while his average ice time was just above 12 minutes per game.Despite the fact that his role was not significant, he still managed to display the offensive potential that led to him being taken in the first round by the NHL. His influence, however, has been more prominent in the AHL (American Hockey League), where he had a total of 7 points in 5 games with the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins during this season after getting 39 points in 60 games in the previous season.Even after the setback, Pittsburgh is still in the playoff hunt. The Penguins, who had a great start, have slightly dipped but still hold the second wild-card position in the Eastern Conference, just a bit ahead of the Buffalo Sabres. The team recently won a game against Columbus with a score of 5–4 in overtime and now has to face a tough schedule of New Jersey, Calgary, and Boston.The Penguins have temporarily lost Rutger McGroarty to the injured reserve list, but the health of the player is still the first priority for the organization. His recovery time will be watched closely while Pittsburgh is trying to keep up with the race for the playoffs.Also Read: NHL Trade Rumors: Ottawa Senators linked to Rasmus Andersson while Vancouver Canucks and Edmonton Oilers explore changes","Pittsburgh Penguins forward Rutger McGroarty was put on injured reserve due to a concussion.

Shohei Ohtani surprises Ashley Kelly with a Porsche during his free agency





Shohei Ohtani surprised many people when he gifted a silver Porsche worth over $100,000 to Ashley Kelly, the wife of former Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Joe Kelly. The gift was given in late 2023, when Shohei Ohtani was still a free agent and had not yet signed with the Dodgers. This week, the story came back into the spotlight after MLB shared the old clip again on Instagram.Ashley Kelly responded by posting a fresh photo of the same Porsche on her own Instagram. She shared how the gift still makes her smile every time she opens the car door. Her post quickly caught attention from baseball fans, especially with Shohei Ohtani now being one of the biggest stars in Los Angeles.The gift goes back to December 2023, when Shohei Ohtani was deciding his future after leaving the Los Angeles Angels. Around that time, Ashley Kelly openly supported the Dodgers’ push to sign him.She even started a fun online campaign and later helped make room for him by giving up her husband’s old jersey number, No. 17.Soon after, Shohei Ohtani gifted Ashley Kelly a silver Porsche, a moment that stunned fans. The car is valued at more than $100,000.On Wednesday, after MLB reposted the old video, Ashley shared a new photo of the car on Instagram and wrote a heartfelt message.“If you were wondering, I still chuckle or smile every time I open this car’s door to drive it. What a life. Thank you God. Thank you Sho & thank you to JK for throwing a baseball really well over all these years,” Ashley Kelly wrote.She also joked about her long support for her husband, adding, “This clear chase of a wife stuck with your vet status for this very moment. So strategic. Obviously.”Ashley Kelly also thanked MLB for bringing the memory back, writing, “Thanks for the trip down Winter 2023 memory lane.”Just days after that gift, Shohei Ohtani signed his historic 10-year, $700 million deal with the Los Angeles Dodgers, officially joining the team in December 2023.Joe Kelly changed his jersey number from 17 to 99 soon after Shohei Ohtani arrived. In December 2023, he told ESPN why the moment mattered to him.“I wasn’t going to give it up to just anybody,” Joe Kelly said. “If Shohei keeps performing, he’ll be a future Hall of Famer, and I’ll be able to have my number retired. That’s the closest I’ll get to the Hall of Fame.”Life has changed quickly for the Kelly family since then. On Sunday, Ashley Kelly shared photos from a family shoot at Wailea Beach in Maui, Hawaii.The pictures showed Joe Kelly, Ashley Kelly, and their children Knox, Kai, and twins Crue and Blake, all dressed in relaxed beach outfits.“To the next chapter & new beginnings. Happy New Year! Love, The Kelly Family,” she wrote.In October 2024, when the Dodgers won the World Series, Ashley Kelly also posted praise for her husband. “3X WORLD SERIES CHAMPION, JOE KELLY. In complete awe of what my husband continues to do in baseball,” she wrote.Joe Kelly officially announced his retirement on December 31 after 13 MLB seasons with the St. Louis Cardinals, Boston Red Sox, Los Angeles Dodgers, and Chicago White Sox.Even as that chapter closes, one silver Porsche still carries a smile-filled reminder of a special baseball moment.Also Read: MLB Trade Rumors: Ketel Marte Trade Buzz Grows As New York Yankees, Chicago Cubs, And Los Angeles Dodgers Watch Arizona Diamondbacks","Shohei Ohtani surprised Ashley Kelly with a Porsche during his free agency in December 2023.

Zion Williamson trends online after unverified OF allegations surface

There are no reported legal filings related to the claim



There is no confirmed DNA test



There has been no public response from Zion Williamson or his representatives



There is no involvement from law enforcement or the NBA







Zion Williamson is trending across social media and this time, it has nothing to do with basketball. The New Orleans Pelicans star has found himself at the center of online conversation after an OF creator made public claims involving him, sparking widespread speculation and debate.While the story has spread rapidly across platforms, it’s important to separate what is being alleged online from what has actually been confirmed.The situation began when a model posted on social media claiming about being involved with Zion Williamson. She publicly shared screenshots meant to support her claim.These posts quickly went viral, pulling Zion’s name into online discourse and fueling headlines across gossip and sports-adjacent media spaces.At this time, these statements remain allegations made on social media, not findings supported by court documents or official filings.What has not been confirmedAs of now:No reputable outlet has reported the existence of an active legal case tied to these allegations. This distinction is critical, as much of the online reaction has blurred the line between rumor and fact.Despite the lack of confirmation, the story exploded online.Fans and users across X, Instagram, and TikTok reacted with a mix of shock, jokes, concern, and speculation.As is often the case with high-profile athletes, the virality of the claim quickly outpaced verified information. Memes and reaction posts began circulating within hours, turning the situation into a trending topic rather than a substantiated news event.This isn’t the first time Zion’s name has trended for off-court reasons. In 2023, his personal life became a public talking point following relationship-related drama that also played out online.Combined with his ongoing injury struggles and limited availability on the court, moments like this tend to gain more traction. When a star athlete is absent from games, attention often shifts to their personal life, fairly or not.Williamson’s focus remains on recovery and availability, and there have been no reports suggesting disciplinary action, team intervention, or league involvement related to the online allegations.Right now, the Zion Williamson controversy story exists largely in the realm of viral speculation, not verified reporting. While social media has amplified the claims, there is no confirmed legal action or official statement backing them.Also read - Luka Dončić vs. Giannis: NBA All-Star fan vote heats up as rookie Wembanyama climbs","Zion Williamson is trending across social media after unverified allegations surface.

Brett Favre sets the record straight

How is Brett Favre dealing with Parkinson’s disease

Also Read:





NFL legend Brett Favre has strongly pushed back against a viral social media post that falsely claimed he had “given up hope” while battling Parkinson’s disease. The former quarterback made it clear that while his condition has progressed, he is far from quitting and remains determined to keep fighting.The misleading claim spread rapidly online and reached millions of users, prompting concern among fans. Favre, 56, addressed the issue directly in statements to the media and on social platforms, calling the report completely inaccurate.“I have absolutely not given up and I am fighting till the end,” Favre said on TMZ Sports. “Yes, I have progressed a little faster than I would have hoped, but I’m extremely thankful and blessed.”Favre revealed his Parkinson’s diagnosis publicly in September 2024 during a hearing on Capitol Hill. Since then, he has spoken openly about his health on his podcast, 4th and Favre, discussing both the physical and mental challenges that come with the disease.In recent days, comments from the podcast were taken out of context, leading some social media users to wrongly suggest that Favre had lost hope. The former quarterback said that could not be further from the truth.On social media, Favre thanked fans for their prayers and support while again denying the claim. “Just like I never gave up on the gridiron, I’m not going to start now,” he wrote, adding that he still hopes for better treatments and, one day, a cure.Parkinson’s disease is a progressive neurological condition with no known cure. Favre has explained that he has idiopathic Parkinson’s, the most common form of the illness. He has shared that symptoms such as stiffness, fatigue, and mild shaking are part of his daily routine, especially before medication takes effect.Even with these problems, Favre stays active and involved. He uses his platform to raise awareness about the long-term effects of head injuries and neurological diseases on athletes.Favre's answer shows the same toughness that made him a great player. He was a three-time NFL MVP and a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame. During his career with the Green Bay Packers and other teams, he became known for being tough.While his post-football life has included controversy and health struggles, Favre’s latest message was focused on clarity and strength. He acknowledged the seriousness of his condition but stressed that realism does not mean surrender.Favre says that for now, he is taking things one day at a time and relying on his family, religion, and medical care. He has a clear and strong message for fans: the struggle is not done.","A viral social media post falsely claimed that Brett Favre had given up on his battle with Parkinson's disease.

Mitchell has been carrying a heavy load all season and is coming off a 30-point performance in a loss to Detroit. The Cavaliers made the call early, and there was never any expectation that his status might change closer to tip-off.Donovan Mitchell is listed as out with “rest” as the only note. There is no new issue and no lingering concern from recent games. Cleveland has leaned on him for nearly 30 points a night while asking him to handle a large share of the offense. With the season still long and the team hovering just above .500, the Cavs chose to protect their top scorer rather than push him through another road game.The Cleveland Cavaliers sit at 20-17 and are already close to last season’s loss total. Managing Mitchell’s workload has become a priority, especially with playoff positioning still in flux. Indiana’s current situation made this an easier spot to rest him, even if Cleveland understands there are no automatic wins in the league.The decision reflects long-term thinking more than anything related to this single matchup.Mitchell is not the only question mark for Cleveland Cavaliers. Jarrett Allen is questionable with an illness and will be evaluated closer to game time. Dean Wade is also questionable due to a left knee contusion, which could further thin the frontcourt. Max Strus remains out as he continues to recover from left foot surgery, and Larry Nance Jr. is sidelined with a right calf injury.Those absences leave Cleveland with less margin for error, especially on the road.The Pacers are dealing with a long injury list of their own. Tyrese Haliburton is out for the season with a right Achilles tear. Bennedict Mathurin is sidelined with a right thumb sprain. Isaiah Jackson remains out with a concussion, and Obi Toppin is unavailable due to a right foot stress fracture. The injuries have stripped Indiana of ball-handling, scoring, and depth.How the game shifts without MitchellWithout Mitchell, Cleveland’s offense becomes more dependent on Darius Garland to create shots and control tempo. Evan Mobley is expected to see more touches as a scorer and facilitator. Shooters like Sam Merrill and wings such as Jaylon Tyson will need to knock down open looks to keep the floor spaced.For Indiana, Mitchell’s absence offers a small opening during a 12-game losing streak. Still, the Pacers’ own injuries mean they will rely heavily on Pascal Siakam and a limited supporting cast to produce enough offense against a Cleveland defense that remains solid even without its top scorer.Also read: Cleveland Cavaliers vs Indiana Pacers regular season game injury report: Who's out, key players, where to watch, and more (January 6, 2026) This game loses its biggest name, but it puts the focus squarely on execution and depth on both sides.",Donovan Mitchell is listed as out with “rest” as the only note.
