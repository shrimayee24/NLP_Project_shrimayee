NEW DELHI: New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon made a remark related to rivalry in cricket between the two nations during a joint press conference with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday, which led to laughter. Luxon mentioned New Zealand’s recent cricket losses to India and thanked Modi for not bringing them up.""I really appreciate that PM Modi didn't raise New Zealand's Champions Trophy loss to India and I didn't raise our Test victories in India. Let's keep it that way and avoid a diplomatic incident,"" Luxon said.India won the ICC Men’s Champions Trophy for the third time on March 9, defeating New Zealand by four wickets in the final at the Dubai International Stadium. In November 2024, New Zealand had defeated India 3-0 in a Test series. This was the first time India was whitewashed in a Test series of three or more matches at home.Also read: First time in 91 years!

They welcomed the signing of a Memorandum of Cooperation on Sports to strengthen collaboration and engagement. They also acknowledged the upcoming ""Sporting Unity"" events in 2026, which will mark 100 years of sporting ties between the two countries.As a reflection of the cultural connection between India and New Zealand, Luxon was also seen with New Zealand cricketers Ajaz Patel and Ross Taylor.","New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon made a remark related to rivalry in cricket between the two nations.

Is Rodgers headed for a coaching role in San Francisco?



Aaron Rodgers Caught Deeply Contemplating His Future On Beach | Pat McAfee Show

Why the 49ers and Why now?



Aaron Rodgers’ future in the NFL remains one of the biggest talking points in football. While teams like the Pittsburgh Steelers and New York Giants are rumored to be in the mix, a surprising alternative has emerged—coaching. Reports suggest Rodgers may step away from playing in 2025 and join the San Francisco 49ers ’ staff, potentially setting the stage for a major leadership role in the future.Rodgers has repeatedly dismissed the idea of coaching post-retirement, but circumstances change. As one of the most intelligent quarterbacks in NFL history, he possesses the strategic mind that could make him a successful coach. With insiders predicting that he may not suit up in 2025, some believe he could step into a coaching role with the 49ers, possibly positioning himself as Kyle Shanahan ’s eventual replacement.""While Kyle Shanahan is safe for the 2025 NFL season, there is a real chance that his future in 2026 is not,"" Marissa Myers noted. ""With that in mind, it presents the perfect opportunity for Rodgers to take the next step in his career, and enter the realm of coaching."" (via: Sporting News)Also Read: Steelers set to sign veteran QB in 2025 Free Agency, but it’s not who you think Shanahan has guided San Francisco to multiple deep playoff runs, but his tenure has also been marked by inconsistency. With four playoff misses in eight seasons, concerns about his long-term viability continue to grow. Critics argue that his inability to adapt is holding the 49ers back. Rodgers, a four-time MVP, could bring a fresh perspective and serve as a mentor for young quarterback Brock Purdy, helping the team transition into its next phase.Adding to the intrigue, Rodgers’ California roots make this move even more compelling. A lifelong 49ers fan, he once dreamed of being drafted by them. If he transitions into coaching, leading his hometown team would be a full-circle moment in his storied career, cementing his legacy in a way few could have predicted.Rodgers remains unpredictable, keeping fans and analysts on edge. But if he decides to swap his helmet for a headset, the 49ers could be his next big move, one that not only shakes up the NFL landscape but also solidifies his place in football history as both a legendary player and a strategic mastermind on the sidelines.","Reports suggest Aaron Rodgers may step away from playing in 2025 and join the San Francisco 49ers ’ staff.

Donna Kelce’s health struggles highlight importance of support systems



Travis Kelce, the NFL's most well-known star, has been the subject of debate regarding his future in football. While fans wonder if he will retire, fresh reports indicate that personal reasons, such as his mother Donna Kelce's health issues, are taking center stage in his decision-making.The Kansas City Chiefs tight end, Travis Kelce has never been shy about his tight-knit relationship with his family, especially his mom, Donna Kelce. She recently shared about a difficult health condition that has touched their family deeply. Though details are not made public, it's clear that Donna's condition has given Kelce's already grueling career an added emotional burden.Her fight is a harsh reminder of the need to put both physical and emotional health first. The NFL has come a long way in advancing health awareness, from pushing regular medical check-ups to developing mental health programs. Kelce, through his own experiences, is also increasing the call for these conversations.Travis Kelce's retirement has become a burning issue, particularly following another Super Bowl win with the Chiefs. Whereas his physicality in the sport has been questioned extensively, now his mental and emotional health become important factors.Balancing the constant demands of professional football with personal issues is no simple matter. Kelce's case highlights how deeply personal issues can drive an athlete's career choices. Whether it's injuries, family obligations, or mental exhaustion, these issues weigh heavily in deciding how long to remain in the game.Mental health activism in sport has gained pace over the past decade, with great numbers of athletes openly discussing their dilemmas. Kelce's case further reiterates the need for support mechanisms, both team-based and family-based, to allow players to make choices that promote their well-being.Kelce's impact is felt off the field as well. As a vocal mental health advocate, he has contributed to mainstreaming discussions on emotional resilience and psychological well-being in high-stress settings. His possible retirement, prompted by personal and family struggles, adds further impetus for robust mental health support systems in professional sport.Also Read: “I'm 95 percent of the reason”: Rashee Rice reveals that not Taylor Swift but he convinced Travis Kelce not to retire As this situation plays out, it is a poignant reminder that even the largest of stars have their own demons.

"NBA Offseason Rumors: Los Angeles Lakers could bag $179,299,750 Denver Nuggets superstar to bolster roster; perfect fit for Luka-LeBron duo?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/nba-offseason-rumors-los-angeles-lakers-could-bag-179299750-denver-nuggets-superstar-to-bolster-roster-perfect-fit-for-luka-lebron-duo/articleshow/119062506.cms,"The Los Angeles Lakers are contemplating a significant roster change by potentially trading Austin Reaves to acquire Michael Porter Jr. from the Denver Nuggets. Porter's exceptional three-point shooting could address the Lakers' weaknesses as they aim for a deep postseason run. However, Denver's desire to retain Porter might complicate the deal.

""Denver was adamant about retaining Porter amid NBA trade rumors this season,""

The Los Angeles Lakers are reportedly considering a major roster shakeup as they weigh the possibility of parting ways with Austin Reaves to pursue Denver Nuggets star Michael Porter Jr. The move, which could significantly bolster the Lakers' three-point shooting, comes amid their push to solidify their position in the Western Conference playoff race.Since acquiring Luka Doncic in a blockbuster trade on February 2, the Lakers have shown flashes of brilliance but have struggled recently, losing their last three games. The team is still in the running for the No. 2 seed in the West despite the defeats. Under head coach JJ Redick, the team's three-point shooting has been a clear problem this season, as they only shoot 35.7% from beyond the arc.This has led to speculation that the Los Angeles Lakers may target Michael Porter Jr., a proven three-point specialist, in the offseason. Porter, who signed a $179 million contract with the Nuggets, has been one of the league's most consistent long-range shooters since entering the NBA. As a rookie, he shot an impressive 42.2% from downtown and has maintained a high level of efficiency, connecting on at least 39.7% of his three-point attempts in four of his last five seasons.This season, the 2023 NBA champion is averaging 18.2 points and 6.9 rebounds per game while shooting 50.6% from the field and 39.9% from three-point range. His ability to move without the ball and deliver a flawless release makes him an ideal fit for a Los Angeles Lakers team in need of reliable perimeter shooting.While Austin Reaves has been a versatile and valuable asset for the Lakers, Porter's elite shooting could provide the team with a significant upgrade. Reaves has been a key contributor, but his skill set may not be enough to address the Lakers' most pressing needs.However, acquiring Porter won't be easy. The Nuggets have consistently expressed their commitment to keeping him, especially after his crucial role in their championship run.making it unlikely they would part with him unless he experiences a decline in performance.Also read: NBA Offseason Rumors: Golden State Warriors eyeing $90 million Los Angeles Clippers star to push Stephen Curry and Jimmy Butler's championship aspirations As the playoffs approach, the Los Angeles Lakers are expected to keep a close eye on Porter's situation. If the Nuggets' stance softens, Los Angeles could make a strong push to bring the sharpshooter to Crypto.com Arena, potentially reshaping their roster for a deeper postseason run.","The Los Angeles Lakers are reportedly considering a major roster shakeup as they weigh the possibility of parting ways with Austin Reaves to pursue Michael Porter Jr. The move, which could significantly bolster the Lakers' three-point shooting, comes amid their push to solidify their position in the Western Conference playoff race.

Overview of Mookie’s position change in Dodgers roster

Dodgers Manager Dave Roberts shared a shocking update on Mookie Betts ‘illness.’ He shared that the team is contemplating sending him back to LA. Consequently, Mookie will be missing from the next clash against the Chicago Cubs, a part of the Tokyo Series edition scheduled for this week at the Tokyo Dome. Mookie Betts has recently taken up the full-time shortstop position. He proved his pivotal prowess in offensive and defensive fronts last year.Mookie Betts will be sent back to LA to recover from illness completely!Dave Roberts shared a shocking update on Mookie Betts' recovery from his illness. According to The Atheltic’s Fabian Ardaya’s tweet, the team is contemplating keeping the shortstop star entirely away from the Tokyo Series exhibition games and sending him back to LA to speed up his recovery.Per the team’s latest plans, Mookie will likely be given complete rest to ensure faster recovery. Thus, he will be missing from the upcoming clash against the Chicago Cubs scheduled this week at the Tokyo Dome. Explaining Mookie’s condition, Roberts said:“He’s still trying to find his way [physically].” He continued, “I think the question is, what’s best to get him ready for opening day? We’re still talking. That’s on the table.”The situation is disappointing for the Dodgers team and fans. Their two-way genius, Mookie Bett, is struggling with an illness, which LA Times’ Jack Harris confirmed in his report dated March 16, 2025, to be a ‘ stomach virus infection .’Earlier, Roberts, while talking to the press about the Tokyo experience on Saturday, also revealed Mookie’s condition.He said he was feeling better and planned to engage him in hitting balls and taking ground balls the next day. However, the latest update seems to suggest something different.In February 2025, Mookie announced moving to a shortstop position from his right-field forte. The change was strategized to strengthen the Dodgers’ infield as Mookie showed good form as the shortstop last year when he played 65 of 116 games at this position.Mookie is an OG shortstop, as the Boston Red Sox drafted him to command this spot. However, his golden era began after moving to the right outfield, where he bagged recognitions like All-Star and Gold Glove during his time with the Red Sox and the Dodgers.Mookie's stunning performance last year cemented his position on the Dodgers’ team. The team’s plan to give him complete rest is a thoughtful step to help him be at his best at the regular-season game against the Detroit Tigers on March 27.Also Read: Mookie Betts confident in shortstop role despite Manny machado’s concerns over tough transition","Dodgers Manager Dave Roberts shared a shocking update on Mookie Betts’ ‘illness’ He shared that the team is contemplating sending him back to LA.

Liv Morgan Revenge Tour

Liv Morgan isn’t just another WWE champion. She’s a problem. The kind that makes crowds boo louder, the kind that hijacks segments, the kind that gets exactly what she wants—even if it means wrecking the lives of everyone around her. Theis running strong, and there’s no end in sight.She’s done waiting for WWE to believe in her. They gave her a couple of runs as a babyface, but let’s be real—those weren’t it. The crowd wanted to root for her, but it never felt. She’d climb, she’d fall, rinse, repeat. WWE had her play the underdog so long, people forgot she could bite back. Now? She’s all bite. No leash.The second she got back from injury, Liv Morgan went after Rhea Ripley . She didn’t even wait for a match—just took a steel chair, went backstage, and wrecked her. A few months later, Ripley was injuredand forced to vacate the Women’s World Championship. Morgan took the title for herself. And now she’s spending every week making Dominik Mysterio ’s life hell while Judgment Day watches in horror.This isn’t the Liv Morgan WWE tried to build. This is the one she built herself.Long before WWE, Liv Morgan was just a kid in New Jersey, wrestling in a homemade ring with her brothers, pretending to be Lita. There was no roadmap. No indie scene. Just a girl who liked wrestling and got lucky in a way most wrestlers don’t.She wasn’t grinding in small promotions or building a reputation on the circuit. She was working at Hooters, where she met an unnamed wrestler who changed everything. She told them she was a fan, rattled off her wrestling knowledge, and the next thing she knew, she was introduced to trainer Joe DeFranco. DeFranco trained Triple H . He had. And when WWE didn’t have an open tryout, he got them to fly her out anyway.Liv Morgan signed in 2014 and started training at the WWE Performance Center in Orlando. It wasn’t pretty.Her first big moment inwasn’t even in the ring—it was as a planted fan at, jumping Tyler Breeze during his entrance. She wrestled a few months later under the name “Marley” and got squashed by Eva Marie. She was bad. She knew it.She kept losing. Then she rebranded as Liv Morgan and started losing. WWE didn’t see her as a star. She was just there. She got her first televised win nearly a year later against Aliyah, but by then, everyone already knew what came next—call-ups were happening, and she wasn’t on the list.Then WWE did what WWE does. They threw her into a faction.Liv Morgan didn’t get called up alone. She debuted onin November 2017 with Ruby Riott and Sarah Logan as. It was chaos from day one—they ran through Becky Lynch , Naomi, Charlotte Flair, and Natalya, making it clear they weren’t just filler.The chemistry kept them together longer than planned. Ruby Riott later admitted that WWE never had a long-term plan for them, but Vince McMahon liked the energy. That’s all it took. They lasted until 2019 before WWE split them, and just like that, Morgan was on her own.WWE tried, They gave her video vignettes. They teased a new character. They had her interrupt Lana and Bobby Lashley’s wedding to say she’d been having an affair with Lana. And then? Nothing.Rusev (now AEW’s Miro) later revealed that WWE only wrote the segment formoment—to get a reaction. No long-term story. No follow-up. Just shock value.After that? WWE threw her back with Ruby Riott and called itagain. It lasted a year before WWE fired Riott.Morgan was alone again, but this time, WWE actually pulled the trigger.She wonin 2022.

Ja Morant’s absence will be a blow for the Grizzlies and could tilt the balance in this Western Conference showdown.","Ja Morant, averaging 19.6 points and 5.5 assists over the last 20 games, is a key player for Memphis.

All-out Performance from Jesper Bratt & Heroics of Darcy Kuemper

Montour matches NHL record scoring 4 SECONDS into OT! 🦑🚨🫨

The NHL had an extremely exciting week of record-breaking performances and entertaining finishes. Jesper Bratt dominated the scoreboard for the New Jersey Devils, recording an incredible nine-point mark, and maintaining rock-solid goaltending for the Los Angeles Kings Darcy Kuemper. Seattle Kraken's Brandon Montour made history with a record-equalling overtime goal, and now Jack Eichel has set a new single-season points record for the Vegas Golden Knights. Meanwhile, players had their safety issues brought back to life as reckless hits opened old wounds.Joseph Bratt, though, came as close to what might reasonably be termed the most effective week for any NHL forward with a tally of three points in games against both the Columbus Blue Jackets and the Edmonton Oilers. This was thereafter followed up with another 3-point, 3-assist night in a 7-3 defeat by the Pittsburgh Penguins and sealed him with a nine-point haul, making him the top scorer in the league for the week.Meanwhile, it was a near-impenetrable defensive wall as he played three games, allowing only one goal, with a shutout victory against the Washington Capitals and Nashville Predators for his 200th NHL career victory. The above also accounts for a top-notch contribution to the playoff push of the Kings with an unbelievable 98.7% save percentage. Florida Panthers' Sergey Bobrovsky also made a personal best when he got his 424th win in the NHL, placing him in the top 10 goaltenders of all time.Brandon Montour's Lightning-Fast Goal & Record-Breaking Season For Jack Eichel: Only four seconds elapsed from the start of overtime when defenseman Brandon Montour of the Seattle Kraken provided one of the season's most electrifying moments with a game-winning goal. This all followed a perfectly executed faceoff play by Chandler Stephenson to set Montour up for a blistering finish past Jakub Dobes. With that, he recorded the fastest overtime goal, tying him with Claude Provost, Denis Savard, and James van Riemsdyk in the record books as tied for this league mark. Moreover, Montour broke a franchise record for goals in a season by a Kraken defenseman.Eichel of the Vegas Golden Knights eclipsed the franchise record of William Karlsson for points in a single season, finishing with 80 this season. He is also quite close to making it a potential 100-pointer, having left 16 games behind, which would boost his already impressive standing as an elite forward in the NHL. Unfortunately, the week resulted in even more than action: it was a week of unearthed bone-judging towards player safety. Bursting from the unfortunate collision, Buffalo Sabres' Jiri Kulich got a severe hit, while Vancouver Canucks' Filip Chytil, a concussion history patient, took an even more dangerous hit from Jason Dickinson of the Chicago Blackhawks. Many called for suspending Dickinson, but he somehow escaped. Ladislav Smid, former NHL defenseman, emphasized that players needed to show more respect for each other on the ice, thus needing stricter enforcement against reckless plays.Also Read : Brandon Montour Makes NHL History with the Fastest OT Goal in the Seattle Kraken’s Comeback Win From Jesper Bratt's show-stopping offensive play to Brandon Montour's monumental goal, the NHL has provided stellar entertainment.

Florida Panthers Make Sam Bennett's Extension A Priority

Sam Bennett is about to become one of the hottest free agents in the NHL, although he will probably stay with the Florida Panthers . The speculation about his future gets hotter as his contract expires after July 1. On the other hand, some reports have recently come to note that the Panthers have resumed their negotiations for contracts with him.Sam Bennett, 28, is wrapping up this final year of four years on a $17.7 million contract, carrying a cap hit of $4.425 million. Since joining the Panthers through a trade in 2021 from the Calgary Flames, he has established himself as an important cog in the system. The combination of offensive prowess and physicality makes him indispensable.Over 278 games in Florida, Bennett has scored 92 goals and added 98 assists. In the playoffs, he has scored a prolific 37 points from 54 postseason games. Bennett was for the Panthers in their 2024 Stanley Cup run as he notched 14 points in 19 playoff games while leading with 87 hits.He is characteristic of a blend of very skillful, gritty, and very leadership qualities. This indeed makes him valuable in all battles and in deepest playoffs. Bennett plays a dual game and can thus contribute in all areas. He can show up in scores or just through relentless forechecking; in the end, it's all Bennett. Florida has depended greatly on him for delivering such important moments, and unfortunately, his departure leaves that squad one massive gap.Once again, Bennett has proven to be up to the challenge with 22 goals and 45 points in 65 games this season. His combination of offensive flair and toughness would bolster any team's roster, hence why he is attracting teams' interest, with the Maple Leafs reported to be one of the interested teams. However, Panthers GM Bill Zito has made it very clear that he wants both Sam Bennett and other pending free agents, Aaron Ekblad, to stay in Florida. The front office is negotiating actively to secure such a deal before free agency begins.Also Read: ""I Haven't Played to the Expectations,"" Admits Vancouver Canucks Forward Elias Pettersson Sam Bennett's future is uncertain due to the coming free agency, but the Florida Panthers are doing anything possible to ensure that they will be able to acquire him.

Can Shreyas Iyer and Ricky Ponting finally bring PBKS their maiden IPL title?

NEW DELHI: Punjab Kings have experienced a rollercoaster journey in the Indian Premier League (IPL) since the tournament's inception in 2008. Despite boasting star-studded squads over the years, consistency has been their biggest challenge.The franchise, formerly known as Kings XI Punjab, delivered their best performance in 2014 when they reached the final but lost to Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) by three wickets in the title clash.Since then, the team has struggled to progress beyond the league stage.Determined to change their fortunes, Punjab Kings made bold moves in the IPL 2025 Mega Auction where they splurged on marquee players like Shreyas Iyer, Marcus Stoinis, Marco Jansen, Glenn Maxwell, Lockie Ferguson and Yuzvendra Chahal.The franchise has now handed the captaincy to Iyer, hoping his leadership will guide them to their first-ever IPL title . Iyer played a pivotal role in leading KKR to their third title in 2024, ending a decade-long wait.One of Punjab’s promising young talents, Prabhsimran Singh , who was retained for Rs 4 crore ahead of IPL 2025, believes Iyer could be the team’s lucky charm this season.The youngster is optimistic that Punjab Kings will finally claim their maiden IPL title in 2025.""Shreyas has been an amazing leader.

Bengals break the bank for dynamic duo

Cam Ward ""Guaranteed"" #1 Pick In The 2025 Draft?! | Pat McAfee Show

Can Bengals afford to keep everyone?

Joe Burrow made it clear that keeping Ja’Marr Chase and Tee Higgins was a must. When financial hurdles arose, he stepped up, offering to restructure his contract. Now, both receivers have secured massive extensions, solidifying Cincinnati’s offensive firepower. But with cap space dwindling, the Bengals face tough financial decisions ahead. The big question remains, how will they manage their roster while staying competitive?The Bengals pulled off what many thought was impossible, securing both Chase and Higgins despite concerns about financial constraints. Ja’Marr Chase’s record-setting performances made his extension a no-brainer, and the team rewarded him with a historic 4-year, $161 million deal, including $112 million guaranteed. With an annual average salary of $40.25 million, Chase is now the highest-paid non-quarterback in the NFL.Meanwhile, Tee Higgins initially franchise-tagged secured his long-term future as well. His 4-year, $115 million extension, featuring two guaranteed years, makes him the highest-paid WR2 in the league at an average annual salary of $28.75 million. It’s a dream scenario for Burrow, who now has both of his top targets locked in for the foreseeable future.While Bengals fans celebrate, analysts are scrutinizing the team’s financial flexibility moving forward. Former NFL punter and media personality Pat McAfee voiced the question on everyone’s mind: “What do they do with the rest of the salary cap?”One looming concern is the future of defensive end Trey Hendrickson. The Pro Bowl pass rusher has yet to secure an extension, and rumors are swirling about a potential trade. ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler even pointed to the Indianapolis Colts as a possible destination, citing defensive coordinator Lou Anarumo’s past connections with Hendrickson from his Bengals tenure.As it stands, Cincinnati has approximately $26.8 million in cap space. However, additional room may be needed to solidify their defense and address other roster needs. This brings Burrow’s contract restructuring into play once again. With his 5-year, $275 million contract, the Bengals have the flexibility to push cap hits into future years or convert portions into signing bonuses.Locking down Chase and Higgins secures Cincinnati’s offensive firepower, but it’s just one piece of the puzzle. The team must now navigate the financial landscape wisely, ensuring that the defense doesn’t suffer in the process.Also Read: Derek Stingley Jr. lands massive $90M deal, becomes NFL’s highest-paid cornerback For now, Bengals fans can revel in the fact that their franchise quarterback got exactly what he wanted, his top weapons staying put.

Will Rohit Sharma win 2027 World Cup? Astrologer Lobo predicts after getting Champions Trophy bang on!

Former Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul-Haq has expressed his concerns over the ongoing decline in Pakistan cricket, attributing the issues to poor decision-making and frequent changes within the Pakistan Cricket Board ( PCB ). Speaking to journalists in Lahore, Inzamam highlighted how the lack of stability and consistent planning has negatively impacted the national team's performance in recent years.""We are not working in the right direction and making the wrong calls in many areas,"" he said. Inzamam emphasised that without a proper strategy and its effective implementation, the team’s performance would continue to suffer. He pointed out that the regular changes in team administration, coaching staff, and player selection have only added to the existing confusion and disorder within Pakistan cricket.""I would think that the cricket board now needs to learn from its mistakes and not repeat the same mistakes we have made in the last two years. In the past two years, the performance of the Pakistan team has been on a decline. If we don't work in the right direction, we will continue to fall further,"" he warned.Inzamam's own experience as the PCB’s chief selector was also marred by administrative mishandling, forcing him to resign in 2023 after a conflict of interest situation was poorly managed by the board. Reflecting on his tenure, he remarked, ""We need to sit down and think about where the mistakes are being made.""Drawing from his experience as both a player and a captain, Inzamam explained that continuous changes in management and coaching only undermine player confidence. ""Instead of making too many changes, we need to think carefully about where things are going wrong. If there are constant changes, players won't gain the confidence they need, and the situation will remain the same,"" he said.He also extended his support to Babar Azam , describing him as an outstanding cricketer going through a rough patch. ""Babar Azam is a top player. Everyone goes through a rough patch, but the national team hasn't been playing good cricket for the past few months,"" Inzamam stated, urging the board to trust the management and players while working collaboratively to address the issues at hand.Responding to a question regarding the legacy of the 1990s cricket stars, Inzamam stressed their enduring importance in shaping Pakistan cricket's identity. ""If we look at the players from the 90s generation, Pakistan cricket would lose its strength without them,"" he concluded.","Former Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul-Haq has expressed his concerns over the ongoing decline in Pakistan cricket.

Jalen Brunson, Josh Hart and Donte DiVincenzo on Villanova CONNECTION helping Knicks ELIMINATE 76ers

Months after Donte Divincenzo was traded away from the New York Knicks in a surprising move, the sharpshooter has reunited with his former Villanova teammates Jalen Brunson and Josh Hart—not on the court, but in a lighthearted new AT&T commercial celebrating March Madness. The ad brings the trio back together, reminding fans of the chemistry they built during their college days and their brief but electric time as the “NovaKnicks” in New York.The ad, which debuted just as March Madness fever kicked off, features Donte Divincenzo alongside Jalen Brunson and Josh Hart in a playful nod to their Villanova days. It’s a moment of nostalgia for fans who loved seeing them together in New York before DiVincenzo was traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves.Divincenzo played a crucial role for the Knicks, drilling a career-high 283 three-pointers last season while shooting 40% from beyond the arc. But despite his shooting prowess, New York dealt him away in a blockbuster trade that shook up the team’s dynamic. Since then, he has kept a low profile regarding the move, though his frustration was evident during a heated moment in a Timberwolves preseason game against the Knicks.In the AT&T commercial, however, it’s all smiles. The trio’s undeniable bond shines through, showing that while they may be on different teams now, the NovaKnicks connection remains strong.Though their time as teammates in New York was cut short, Divincenzo, Brunson, and Hart share a history that runs deeper than the NBA. They played together at Villanova during the 2016-17 season before DiVincenzo became a key piece of the Wildcats’ 2018 championship run. After Brunson and Hart moved on, DiVincenzo was eventually welcomed back into their circle when he signed with the Knicks—until the trade sent him packing once again.The AT&T ad seems to suggest that, even as professional basketball separates them, their bond is unbreakable. And for fans who loved seeing them play together, it’s a fun reminder of what once was.Also Read: Report suggests New York Knicks can eye Greg Anthony’s son as a potential trade target While the NovaKnicks may no longer share a locker room, their brotherhood lives on—in memory, in March Madness, and now, in a clever new commercial.","Donte Divincenzo was traded from the New York Knicks to the Minnesota Timberwolves.

UFC 314: Press Conference

In the recentpress conference,was visibly criticized and mocked by the audiences, while his opponent from the upcoming bout,, took a step ahead and carried a globe as a direct attack on Mitchell’s flat-earth stance. The Brazilian fighter even encouraged the chants of “F*ck Bryce Mitchell” raised by the audiences. Following this series of events, the American fighter took to his social media account on Instagram and posted a video of himself accusing Silva of usingon Mitchell.The press conference was rather an unpleasant one for Bryce Mitchell, as he had to raise his voice by the end to make his statement. To his efforts, Silva responded, saying, “Bryce Mitchell, calm down son, you are only here because of me. I have some advice for you: don’t pick up the mic; it’s getting ugly. Don’t do that. Nobody wants to hear from you. No one wants to listen to you.”On March 17, 2025, Mitchell posted a video on Instagram that accused Silva of using some kind of demonic curse on the American fighter ahead of their bout at the UFC 314.“Good morning y’all, I need all my Christian warriors to pray for me,” Mitchell said. “Every single night since the day before the press conference, I’ve had demonic dreams, legions of demons are attacking me every single time I sleep and not one time have I seen any peaceful sleep since that day. These demons surround me, try to fight me and provoke me to anger,” He continued, “And then the dream will switch and they’ll send beautiful women and they’re trying to get me to lust, to cheat on my wife. Satan is using two of my weaknesses to try to expose the evil in my own heart, which is anger and lust.”Mitchell went on to add, “However, where I’m weak, the lord is strong. So please pray for me. Especially if you are fasting right now, please pray for me… Remember guys we wrestle not against flesh blood, but against spiritual wickedness, dark principalities, and evil powers in high places. I am not just fighting a man on April 12th. I am fighting a man possessed by a legion of demons. When I just said the name of Jesus, he was provoked to maliciousness and he started barking like a dog and chanting ‘F— you’.”Towards the end, the American fighter dedicated his fights in the name of God and seemed pretty confident about winning the bout ahead.“Remember guys, the days of me fighting for myself are long gone. I, now, fight for the name of the lord. And Devil, he is not going to waste his time trying to plague for a loser... I will win this fight in the name of the lord. The man’s demons will be cast out of my presence.”While these are indeed some serious allegations, Silva responded with a tweet of his own just hours later on the platform, X.“Bryce, two things, these are not demons, it's just you being afraid to face me and second about the beautiful women you have a hormone called testosterone and you probably have problems with it. Just be ready for April 12th, because I will be.”With the event approaching, the bitterness between the two fighters has spiked multiple levels. All these primarily stemmed from the homophobic, transphobic, and ignorant attitude of Mitchel, which was time and again evident through his statements. His recent Pro-Hitler comment created a lot of controversy, to the point where his public appearances were mocked by the audiences.Also read: ONE 172 fight preview: Masaaki Noiri targets gold against Tawanchai Both the fighters have faced each other at the press conference and now on social media with direct attacks on each other.

Charles Leclerc Reflects on Ferrari's Early Struggles in 2025 F1 Season



Ferrari ’s Charles Leclerc has opened up about the challenges faced by the team following a tough start to the 2025 Formula 1 season . After finishing in eighth place at the Australian Grand Prix, the Monegasque driver pointed out ""two things"" that need immediate attention to improve future performance.The Australian Grand Prix happened under tricky wet weather conditions, which saw McLaren emerging as the dominant force. Lando Norris claimed a commanding victory, reinforcing McLaren’s strong position early in the season. The team was on track for a 1-2 finish until Oscar Piastri’s mishap on the rain-soaked grass cost them valuable points. Red Bull’s Max Verstappen and Mercedes’ George Russell completed the podium, highlighting the competitive depth at the top of the grid.In contrast, Ferrari struggled to match the pace of their rivals. Leclerc's eighth-place finish underscored the team’s challenges, especially in adapting to changing weather conditions. Reflecting on the race, Leclerc admitted that securing fifth place initially seemed possible, but the sudden downpour altered the course of the race.“For a big part of the race we thought P5 was secured and then the rain arrived and everything changed,” Leclerc stated. He acknowledged that the team failed to capitalize on the opportunity to score more points despite the chaotic conditions.Leclerc’s race was further complicated by a spin at Turn 11, which cost him several positions. While the Safety Car helped mitigate the damage, a delayed pit stop to switch to intermediate tires proved costly. Leclerc highlighted two key issues that need addressing:“There are two things we have to look into. The first is easy, it was my mistake. The second is something we will sort out as a team, looking into our decisions and making sure we make the right call if the situation comes up again.""Leclerc wasn’t alone in his frustration.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

The Los Angeles Lakers veteran LeBron James has recently sent his warm wishes for the rising tennis star. At just 17 years old, Russian tennis sensation Andreeva has taken the sports world by storm with her stunning victory at the Indian Wells Masters . Defeating World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka in a thrilling three-set match. But what fueled her determination on the court? According to Andreeva, it was none other than NBA superstar James.Following her championship win, Andreeva revealed that she found motivation from one of LeBron James ’ speeches about mental toughness. “I was listening to the interview of LeBron James, and he was saying that even if you don't play your 100% and even if you don't feel like you're 100% physically, I’m gonna choose to be 100% mentally,” Andreeva shared, via Tennis Channel. “He said that that’s what makes us champions, so I kind of tried to do the same.”Her words quickly reached James, who responded with a heartfelt message on his Instagram Story. “Mirra CONGRATULATIONS!!!!” James wrote praising her latest achievement. “Happy to have helped but honestly YOU did that! All your hard work, drive, and dedication towards your craft! Keep going!” the King added.James wasn’t the only sports icon to celebrate Andreeva’s remarkable achievement. Former tennis star and five-time Grand Slam champion Maria Sharapova also applauded the young Russian’s historic feat. Sharapova was thrilled to see her breakthrough at such a high level.“Many congratulations!” Sharapova shared after Andreeva’s come-from-behind victory over Sabalenka. She also shared that the win was “so well deserved.”Sharapova previously predicted Andreeva’s rise to stardom. In a 2024 interview, she stated that the teenager had the “game and mentality” to make a huge influence in women’s tennis. Andreeva has now proved that prediction right with back-to-back WTA 1000 titles .Andreeva’s Indian Wells win helped her become the youngest player since Tracy Austin in 1979 to defeat both the World No. 1 and World No. 2 en route to a WTA 1000 title. Additionally, she matched Sharapova’s record of 10 consecutive WTA victories before turning 21.“I know as I always say, I can be tough -- and today was not the exception,” Andreeva said. “I know I was, as you like to say, 'a little brat’ a little bit in the morning.

Lakers Face Tough Decision: Is Trading Austin Reaves for a Defensive Big the Right Move?



Is Walker Kessler the Missing Piece to the Lakers' Championship Puzzle?



The Los Angeles Lakers have already made headlines this season by acquiring Luka Doncic to form a superstar duo with LeBron James . However, while their backcourt looks lethal, the team still has a glaring hole in the frontcourt following Anthony Davis ’ departure.With free agency approaching, the Lakers could turn their attention to bolstering the center position—and Utah Jazz ’s Walker Kessler might be the answer. NBA insider Eric Pincus of Bleacher Report recently identified Austin Reaves as a key trade asset, suggesting that Los Angeles could consider moving him to land a defensive anchor.The Los Angeles Lakers had been actively seeking a big man after trading Davis to the Dallas Mavericks in February. They nearly acquired Mark Williams from the Charlotte Hornets at the deadline, but the deal collapsed due to Williams failing his physical. That left Los Angeles scrambling to reinforce its interior defense, an issue that could resurface this summer.Kessler, a 7-foot-2 center known for his shot-blocking and rebounding, could provide much-needed stability in the paint. This season, the Auburn product is averaging 11.5 points, 12.3 rebounds, and 2.5 blocks per game while shooting an impressive 72.5% from the field. However, his individual success hasn’t translated into wins for Utah, which currently sits at a dismal 15-53.With the Jazz in rebuilding mode, they could be open to parting with Kessler for the right return. That’s where Austin Reaves comes into play. The Lakers guard has been a reliable playmaker and shooter, but with Doncic now leading the backcourt, his role may diminish. Moving Reaves for a defensive-minded center could be the logical next step for Los Angeles. Walker Kessler may not have Davis' offensive versatility, but what he brings to the table is just as valuable for a team in need of size and defense. His knack for blocking shots, cleaning up the glass, and finishing strong around the rim would give the Lakers a much-needed interior presence.If Los Angeles is serious about making a deep run next season, adding a young, defensive-minded big like Kessler should be at the top of their to-do list. He’s not a superstar, but he’s exactly the kind of piece that could help round out their roster and make them a more complete team.Also Read: NBA Summer Trade Rumors: Los Angeles Lakers eyeing $217 million All-Star center to form Big 3 with LeBron The Lakers have never shied away from big moves—so don’t be surprised if they make a strong push for Kessler this summer.","The Los Angeles Lakers have a glaring hole in the frontcourt following Anthony Davis’ departure.

'TU KAR SAKTA HAI'

R Ashwin: From fringe player to India's greatest match-winner

NEW DELHI: Delhi Capitals have pressed the reset button ahead of the 2025 edition of the Indian Premier League and will have a new captain, and plenty of fresh faces, from the upcoming season. Wicketkeeper-batter Abishek Porel believes that Delhi Capitals' long wait for the title will finally end under new captain Axar Patel Porel, who was retained by the franchise, highlighted Axar's deep understanding of the team, having spent six years with the Delhi outfit. Axar has been a part of the Delhi Capitals setup since 2019 and has become a crucial player in India's white-ball set-up too.""Axar bhai has been with Delhi Capitals for the last 3-4 (7) years, so he knows everything. He is a good choice. It's good for us too. He is like a big brother and has helped me a lot, both on and off the field. He is funny off the field and focused on the field. I am really excited to play under him, and I am sure DC will win a trophy under his captaincy,"" said Porel during a select media interaction.""I love challenges"" — that's what Porel said while recalling interactions with Rishabh Pant during his time as DC captain. Pant departed from Delhi Capitals last season and will be donning the captaincy hat for a new team this season — Lucknow Super Giants .Porel also revealed that he has now become more fearless in his approach and credited former India skipper Sourav Ganguly , who served as the Director of Cricket for the franchise last season, for this transformation. Delhi Capitals have revamped their backroom staff, appointing Venugopal Rao as the new Director of Cricket while Ganguly transitions to focus on the Women's Premier League.""For me, DC has given me a lot of opportunities. I am really thankful to them. My cricket has gone to another level with these opportunities. Ganguly sir helped me a lot and backed me as well. 'Khul ke khelo, khul ke batting karo' - that's what Ganguly sir always told me,"" Porel said.The youngster is now pumped up for the upcoming season and will draw a lot of confidence from the successful outings in the domestic circuit for Bengal.""Last year, I spent a lot of time with both Ricky sir and Rishabh bhai. They both motivated me a lot. They taught me many things. Rishabh bhai used to have a lot of chats with me. Whenever I batted, he would say, 'Tu kar sakta hai, tu achha khelta hai.' I will take those learnings from Rishabh bhai this season. This season, DC has a new support staff, and they are highly talented. They are frank and very friendly.""I love challenges. From what I was to what I am now, I can see a lot of improvement in my performance and game. For the last 12 months, I have focused on my game and worked on my mental strength. The game has changed a lot and is becoming faster and more challenging. So, I am trying my best to match up to that. The level of cricket has gone really high. I play domestic cricket, but when I wasn't playing or during non-cricket days, I worked a lot at NCA. I had an impressive domestic season, and my ultimate aim is to do well this season,"" he said.","Abishek Porel believes that Delhi Capitals' long wait for the title will finally end under new captain Axar Patel.

CSK SQUAD FOR IPL 2025

NEW DELHI: When discussing title contenders in the IPL, the name Chennai Super Kings (CSK) inevitably rises to the top, thanks to their on-field dominance and a record five titles. With IPL 2025 set to commence on March 22 and CSK kicking off their campaign against fellow five-time champions Mumbai Indians on March 23 at the MA Chidambaram Stadium, all eyes will be on the Yellow Army and their iconic leader Mahendra Singh Dhoni.CSK's dominance can be attributed to the legendary Dhoni, under whose captaincy the team has secured five titles, reached the final ten times, and advanced to the playoffs on 12 occasions.After finishing as runners-up in the inaugural 2008 season, CSK made it to the semifinals in 2009. The following two years, 2010 and 2011, saw them clinch back-to-back titles, establishing their supremacy.In 2012 and 2013, CSK reached the finals but fell short, losing to Kolkata Knight Riders and Mumbai Indians, respectively. In 2014, they missed out on the final after being defeated by Punjab Kings (then Kings XI Punjab) in Qualifier 2.CSK's resurgence came in 2015 when they reached the final once again, only to lose to Mumbai Indians. However, the team faced a major setback when they were suspended from the IPL for two years (2016 and 2017) due to the 2013 IPL spot-fixing and betting scandal.The suspension did not diminish CSK's spirit. They returned triumphantly in IPL 2018, winning the title. In 2019, they narrowly missed out on the championship, losing to Mumbai Indians by just one run in a thrilling final.In 2020, CSK experienced their first failure to qualify for the playoffs, exiting after the league stage. However, they rebounded strongly in 2021 to claim their fourth title.The 2022 season saw another setback as CSK once again failed to reach the playoffs. Yet, they staged a remarkable comeback in 2023, clinching their fifth title.The 2024 season marked a significant change as Dhoni handed over the captaincy to Ruturaj Gaikwad . Unfortunately, the transition did not yield the desired results, as CSK faced an early exit, finishing fifth in the league stage with seven wins and seven losses, amassing 14 points.As IPL 2025 approaches, the burning question remains: Can CSK add a sixth trophy to their decorated cabinet?CSK have consistently checked all the boxes heading into tournaments, which explains their sustained dominance over the years.With the strategic brilliance of Dhoni still in the squad, CSK boast a formidable top-order lineup featuring New Zealand batting stars Rachin Ravindra and Devon Conway, along with the experienced Rahul Tripathi. Staying true to their tradition of prioritising all-rounders, CSK have once again picked a solid side, including Shivam Dube, Deepak Hooda, Vijay Shankar, Ravindra Jadeja, Sam Curran, and Ravichandran Ashwin.CSK's bowling attack also appears well-balanced, with the likes of Jamie Overton, Kamlesh Nagarkoti, Khaleel Ahmed, Shreyas Gopal, Matheesha Pathirana, Mukesh Choudhary, Nathan Ellis, and Noor Ahmad.The only chink in CSK's armour seems to be their captaincy.Ruturaj Gaikwad, who was entrusted with the leadership role in IPL 2024, fell short of expectations as CSK finished fifth in IPL 2024 with seven wins and as many losses.CSK will be hoping that Ruturaj can put the 2024 disappointment behind him and lead the team with fiery determination to secure their sixth title.Devon Conway/Rachin Ravindra*, Ruturaj Gaikwad (capt), Rahul Tripathi, Deepak Hooda/Vijay Shankar, Shivam Dube, Ravindra Jadeja, Sam Curran*, MS Dhoni (wk), R Ashwin, Noor Ahmad/Nathan Ellis*, Matheesha Pathirana*, Khaleel Ahmed (*denotes overseas player)Devon Conway, Rachin Ravindra, Ruturaj Gaikwad (capt), Rahul Tripathi, Deepak Hooda, Vijay Shankar, Shivam Dube, Ravindra Jadeja, Sam Curran, MS Dhoni (wk), R Ashwin, Noor Ahmad, Nathan Ellis, Matheesha Pathirana, Khaleel Ahmed, C Andre Siddarth, Vansh Bedi, Shaik Rasheed, Ramakrishna Ghosh, Shreyas Gopal, Anshul Kamboj, Gurjapneet Singh, Mukesh Choudhary, Kamlesh Nagarkoti","Chennai Super Kings (CSK) have won a record five IPL titles.

Argentina’s footballing maestro Lionel Messi will not feature in the national team’s upcoming World Cup qualifying matches against Uruguay and Brazil, as announced by coach Lionel Scaloni on Monday. The 37-year-old was absent from the 25-man squad, raising questions among fans and media alike.Despite speculation, the Argentine Football Association (AFA) did not provide an official reason for Messi’s exclusion. However, Argentine media reports suggest that the star forward suffered a sore left thigh during Inter Miami ’s 2-1 victory over Atlanta United in Major League Soccer (MLS) on Sunday. Messi played the full 90 minutes, scoring the opening goal in his return to the starting lineup after missing three consecutive matches due to ""load management.""Inter Miami manager Javier Mascherano , who has been cautious with Messi’s fitness throughout the MLS season, addressed the issue following the match against Atlanta United.""We tried to take away from the overload Messi had, so that it wouldn't go further than that. We tried to handle it in the best way. Luckily, we were able to control it and that it didn't turn into an injury or much more... There's no secret in this,"" Mascherano stated.He further explained that Inter Miami has maintained close communication with Argentina’s medical staff regarding Messi’s condition.""Obviously the Argentinian national team doctors are in contact with the doctors here, and they are the ones who specifically talk about that,"" he added.Messi was initially named in Argentina’s 33-man provisional squad but did not make the final cut, leaving fans disappointed ahead of two crucial qualifiers. Argentina, who currently lead the South American standings with 25 points from 12 matches, will face second-placed Uruguay on Friday before hosting fifth-placed Brazil at the Monumental Stadium in Buenos Aires four days later.The absence of the seven-time Ballon d’Or winner is not the only blow for Argentina, as Paulo Dybala , Gonzalo Montiel, and Giovani Lo Celso are also set to miss the doubleheader.","Lionel Messi will not feature in Argentina's upcoming World Cup qualifying matches against Uruguay and Brazil.

Will Rohit Sharma win 2027 World Cup? Astrologer Lobo predicts after getting Champions Trophy bang on!

NEW DELHI: India cricket legend Sunil Gavaskar has praised the incredible depth of Indian cricket following the team's unbeaten run to the 2025 Champions Trophy title, achieved even without ace pacer Jasprit Bumrah . Reflecting on the triumph, Gavaskar made a bold claim that no individual player is indispensable in the current Indian lineup — not even veteran batters Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma Writing in his column for Mid-Day, Gavaskar remarked, ""The triumph in the Champions Trophy and that too without Bumrah also emphasises that nobody is indispensable in this game. In the past too, India has won without Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, but there’s not the slightest doubt that their presence in the team gives the team an even more invincible look.""Gavaskar lauded Team India ’s resilience after bouncing back from a dismal Test series defeat against Australia to clinch victory in the England T20Is and ODIs, followed by the Champions Trophy. He noted how the team’s ability to triumph without their key players showcased the immense talent pool in Indian cricket.""Very seldom has a team depended on one individual like the Indians depended on Jasprit Bumrah in Australia, and his absence from the bowling attack to defend the small target set by India tilted the scales Australia’s way,"" Gavaskar said. ""For the Indian team to bounce back the way they did with comprehensive wins in the ODI and T20 series against England that were played on the team’s return to India tells volumes of the talent that Indian cricket has.""The cricketing great also acknowledged the support from overseas players, who admitted that India would have emerged victorious regardless of the location, dismissing claims that the Dubai setting played a decisive role. ""It is good to see so many overseas cricketers now coming up and saying India would have won anyway wherever they played and not only because they were stationed in Dubai,"" Gavaskar added.Gavaskar’s remarks reflect a sense of confidence in the current Indian setup, asserting that while legends like Kohli and Rohit undeniably elevate the team, the core strength lies in the depth and talent of the entire squad.","India cricket legend Sunil Gavaskar has praised the incredible depth of Indian cricket following the team's unbeaten run to the 2025 Champions Trophy title.
