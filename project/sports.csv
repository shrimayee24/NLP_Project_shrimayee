The dismissal also served as a reminder of the crucial role spinners can play in Test cricket , particularly on surfaces that offer assistance.With England seemingly in control and Brook looking comfortable at the crease, the wicket provided Sri Lanka with a much-needed breakthrough.It remains to be seen whether this moment of brilliance will prove decisive in the context of the match, but it undoubtedly added another chapter to the rich history of spin bowling at Old Trafford.","Sri Lanka spinner Prabath Jayasuriya dismisses England's Harry Brook for 56.

Indian hockey team had the quality and calibre to play in final at Paris Olympics: Sreejesh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/hockey/top-stories/hockey-team-had-the-quality-calibre-to-play-in-final-at-paris-oly-sreejesh/articleshow/112749426.cms,"Excerpts:

Many great players, including Messi, have taken a U-turn after announcing

retirement

. HI president Dilip Tirkey himself has urged you to carry on...

Despite retaining Olympic bronze, are you disappointed that you couldn’t go on to win gold?

Of your two Olympic bronze medals, which is more special — Tokyo or Paris?

How do you deal with pressure?

How did you manage to remain largely injury-free in your career?

You have been put in charge of coaching the Indian junior team. How do you plan to go about it?

Will your retirement create a vacuum?

All these years, as a 'lone ranger' beneath the bar, P R Sreejesh has always had Team India 's back. Now, as he adjusts to a less frenetic life post-retirement, he focuses on how he can bring his trademark commitment and energy to his new job as the junior Indian team's coach .At an exclusive interaction at the TOI office in Kochi, the 36-year-old former India custodian was unequivocal: ""We have a tendency to pamper players.But I think you should always challenge them and give them more tasks. I will put pressure on the players"".Sreejesh said India had everything going for them in Paris and it was ""disappointing"" that we didn't get gold this time. ""India had the quality and calibre to play in the ( hockey ) final in Paris,"" he said emphatically, adding that ""one day, we will be the best team in the world"".He spoke at length on how a goalkeeper is set apart from the other 10 players in the team. ""Actually, he is not playing hockey on the turf. He is a lone ranger. Even if the goalkeeper saves or concedes, he stands alone"". Dismissing comparisons to Emiliano Martinez, the Argentine football goalie of 2022 World Cup fame, as farfetched, he, however, said chance as much as instincts mean life and death to the goalie, quoting the colloquial Malayalam proverb, ""a jackfruit might come crashing down but the rabbit scoots in time"".Finally, Sreejesh categorically refuted any second thoughts on his decision to call it a day. ""It's a happy ending for me. I retired after winning the Olympic bronze and had the honour of carrying the flag during the closing ceremony.""For 18 long years, PR Sreejesh exemplified commitment on the hockey turf. On Friday, TOI got a glimpse into his sense of commitment. After arriving in the city early on Friday morning from Delhi, Sreejesh agreed to visit TOI’s Kochi office in the morning. But soon he learnt his daughter Anusree was unwell and informed us that she had to be taken to a hospital. But he promised that he would be in our office as soon as the doctors finished his daughter’s medical examination. As promised, at 2 in the afternoon, the two-time Olympic bronze medallist walked in accompanied by wife Aneeshya and Anusree. In a long, freewheeling conversation with Team TOI, Sreejesh opened up on a variety of topics.In today’s world, such grand farewells are a rarity. Regardless of the sport or the level of competition, athletes seldom receive a send-off of this magnitude. It’s a happy ending for me. It’s a fitting conclusion to a remarkable career. What if I decide to return and that proves to be a mistake? The media and fans will be quick to criticise and question my comeback. I retired after winning the Olympic bronze and had the honour of carrying the flag during the closing ceremony. On returning home, Hockey India organised a magnificent reception, and my jersey number (16) is now retired. For a sportsperson, it’s difficult to imagine a greater tribute than this.Certainly. It is a fact that India had the quality and the calibre to play in the final. Perhaps that is why there wasn’t as much celebration as there was for the Tokyo Olympics bronze. The Tokyo Olympics medal brought immense joy and relief. Here, the joy of winning was limited. There was some disappointment as the team should have won the semifinal and played the final.Tokyo is special because it came without any expectations. Every time we went to the Olympics, people would say that India would win a medal in hockey. However, I got to lay my hand on a medal only in my third Olympics. Enjoying and celebrating that moment is a special memory. Tokyo bronze will have a pride of place in my heart.Pressure has become a habit now. What I tell our players is that an uncomfortable zone is our pressure zone. When I say my comfort zone, it will be an uncomfortable zone that you cannot even imagine. Just imagine the scenario during a shootout, the weight of a billion people is on you.It’s not that I was completely free from injuries. I was once sidelined for eight months. But the thing is that I ignored many injuries in my career. Both my toes are fractured, with bones displaced inside and I didn’t attempt surgery or proper treatment then. I played using painkillers. Only God knows how many disc bulges I have. About ten years ago, there were around six bulges.I will put pressure on the players. I will give each one in the coaching team specific jobs and they must do it in earnest and submit reports to me. We tend to pamper players. But as a coach, I feel you should always challenge the players and give them more tasks. Another thing is documentation, we should give them (the players) the correct reports.I think for the next two tournaments there will be comparisons with the next goalkeeper, (Krishan) Pathak or Suraj (Karkera), whoever steps into my shoes. After two months it will fade away. They will compare him with the next person. It won’t be a big issue as long as India wins because people won’t notice your mistakes. It is when you lose, you will face questions. If we hadn’t won this time, Harman (Harmanpreet) and I would have faced a lot of criticism because we committed a lot of mistakes.","Former India goalkeeper P R Sreejesh is now coaching the junior Indian team.

NEW DELHI: Cricket is famously known as a game of uncertainties, where the outcome can change dramatically in a matter of moments. Unlike other sports, cricket is influenced by a multitude of factors—weather conditions, pitch behavior, and even the smallest of decisions can have a significant impact.A well-set batsman can be dismissed by an unexpected delivery, or a seemingly hopeless match can turn around with a brilliant catch or a sudden burst of wickets.This unpredictability keeps fans on the edge of their seats, making cricket thrilling and unpredictable, as no result is certain until the very last ball is bowled.Such instance was witnessed during the Maharaja Trophy tournament when three Super Overs were needed to get the result out of a match.The Bengaluru Blasters and Hubli Tigers' Maharaja Trophy match etched its name in the annals of cricket history when the game required three Super Overs to determine a winner, an unprecedented occurrence in the sport.Led by Manish Pandey, the Hubli Tigers emerged victorious against Mayank Agarwal 's Bengaluru Blasters after the standard 20 overs and two Super Overs failed to break the deadlock between the two teams.The Tigers, batting first, posted a total of 164, with the Blasters falling just short at 164 in their allotted 20 overs.

I keep saying this about Bumrah, he is like a Kohinoor diamond – we have to protect him, take care of him, and ensure that he lasts as long as possible.

My wife wants me to be at home and take care of my boys: Rahul Dravid,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/my-wife-wants-me-to-be-at-home-and-take-care-of-my-boys-rahul-dravid/articleshow/112724644.cms,"Top Picks For You Rahul Dravid jokes about playing himself in a biopic: 'If the money is good...'

MUMBAI: When Rahul Dravid is in a good mood, he can leave you in splits. At an event here on Wednesday night, he responded hilariously when quizzed about which actor he would pick to play himself in a biopic. “If the money is good enough, I will play it myself,” the cricket legend quipped. Having stepped down as Team India head coach after guiding Rohit Sharma & Co to their T20 World Cup triumph in the West Indies in June, Dravid humorously referred to himself as “jobless” multiple times and even urged the audience to “send him an email with suggestions on what job he can take up next”.“My wife (Vijeta) wants me to be at home and take care of my boys,” he added.Dravid acknowledged that winning tournaments requires not only skill but also a bit of luck, which can play a significant role in the outcome of big matches.To emphasise this point, Dravid recalled two finals during his nearly three-year tenure as Team India head coach—one in Ahmedabad and the other in Barbados. The first was the 2023 World Cup final on Nov 19, when Travis Head survived a probing spell from India’s newball pacers Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Shami before his 137-run knock broke a billion Indian hearts.“I’ve had time to reflect on it... You realize sometimes you have to do everything right, but luck plays its part,” Dravid said.“On November 19th… we beat Travis Head’s bat 15 times — he didn’t touch a single ball. Sometimes things go your way, but you have to stick to the process,” Dravid, who received the Lifetime Achievement honour at the Ceat Cricket Rating Awards, remarked.Dravid also pointed to India’s thrilling comeback against South Africa in the T20 World Cup final in Barbados on June 29. Despite South Africa needing just 30 runs off the last five overs, India (176/7) defended their total, withSuryakumar Yadav ’s stunning boundary catch turning the game in India’s favour.“Sometimes at the end of the day, you need a little bit of luck. (Against South Africa in T20WC final)… 30 balls to go, 30 runs to go. (It was about) incredible execution, incredible calmness by Rohit. We didn’t focus on what we needed to do, but we needed a guy who could keep his foot within one inch of a line. Sometimes (it is) the skill,” he said, recalling Suryakumar Yadav’s fabulous catch on the long-off boundary to pull off David Miller’s dismissal. It was a catch that tilted a tight game in India’s favour.Reflecting on his time as head coach, Dravid expressed pride in India’s journey to the 2023 World Cup final, where they won nine consecutive matches before losing to Australia in the title clash. “To travel across the country and witness the passion of the fans... just the experience as a coach was phenomenal,” he said.Though they fell short in the 2023 World Cup, Dravid credited the team’s T20 World Cup success to sticking with the same processes and energy. “We needed to create the same vibe, the same team atmosphere... and hope for a little bit of luck on the day,” the 51-year-old explained. Dravid waxed eloquent on India’s ability to churn out top-quality cricketers.“I left in 2011-2012. These (new) players have been able to carry the legacy forward. If you just look at the success that we’ve had over the last 12 years in all the three formats of the game, the time that after we left, it’s been absolutely phenomenal. Very easily, clearly in a lot of the rankings, we’re always (No.) 1 or 2… we’re always up there with anyone,” he said.“I have no doubt that this generation of players, led by people like Rohit and Surya and the (other) guys coming forward in all formats of the game is only going to continue to do that in the future,” he added.","Rahul Dravid jokes about playing himself in a biopic: 'If the money is good enough, I will play it myself' The cricket legend stepped down as Team India head coach after guiding Rohit Sharma & Co to their T20 World Cup triumph in the West Indies in June.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112724666,imgsize-50480,width-400,resizemode-4/112724666.jpg"

The duo had forged a solid unbroken partnership of 98 runs for the sixth wicket.Bangladesh currently trail Pakistan's declared total of 448-6 by 132 runs, with five wickets remaining. The Rawalpindi stadium pitch has proven to be unresponsive to bowlers, nearly diminishing Pakistan's chances of securing a substantial lead.Rahim reached his 28th Test half-century by hitting Shaheen Shah Afridi for his seventh boundary. Das also brought up his fifty, smashing three boundaries and a six in one over from Naseem Shah after Pakistan took the second new ball.However, it was Shadman who anchored Bangladesh's resistance. The 29-year-old left-hander displayed resilience and was closing in on his second century before being bowled by a sharp delivery from Pakistan pacer Mohammad Ali in the final over before tea.Pakistan also dismissed Shakib Al Hasan for 15, as the ace all-rounder played a loose shot against part-time spinner Saim Ayub, who claimed his maiden wicket in his first-ever Test over.Pacer Khurram Shahzad was the standout bowler with figures of 2-47, while Naseem Shah, Mohammad Ali, and Ayub each took a wicket. Spearhead Shaheen Shah Afridi went wicketless in his 18 overs.Earlier, Shadman anchored Bangladesh's innings, adding 52 runs for the fourth wicket with Rahim, following a stubborn 94-run stand with Mominul Haque (50). Shadman hit 12 boundaries during his fighting five-hour, 29-minute stay at the crease.Haque was the only batter dismissed in the post-lunch session, bowled by Shahzad after missing a delivery. He scored 28 runs, hitting five boundaries in his 76-ball innings.Shadman anchored Bangladesh's resistance as Pakistan's pace attack struggled on a Rawalpindi pitch that had significantly slowed down. The Shadman-Haque partnership led the recovery after Pakistan removed Zakir Hasan (12) and captain Najmul Hossain Shanto (16) during the extended three-hour session due to Friday prayers.Pakistan utilized all four pacers but lacked a frontline spinner. Part-time slow bowler Agha Salman trapped Shadman leg-before wicket on 57, but the decision was overturned on review.Bangladesh, resuming at 27-0, lost Zakir early to a brilliant one-handed catch by wicketkeeper Mohammad Rizwan off Naseem Shah’s bowling in the fifth over of the day. Shanto appeared in good touch but was bowled between bat and pad by Shahzad, leaving Bangladesh at 53-2.The second and final Test will also be held in Rawalpindi starting on August 30, as part of the nine-team World Test Championship's third cycle (2023-2025).","Bangladesh trail Pakistan by 132 runs at stumps on third day of first Test.

Croatian midfielder Filip Mrzljak and Argentine forward Norberto Vidal restored Punjab's lead, but Australian Jason Cummings equalized again in the 79th minute, sending the match into a tie-breaker due to the absence of extra-time provisions.In the penalties, Cummings missed MBSG's first spot-kick, giving Punjab an early advantage. However, MBSG goalkeeper Vishal Kaith stopped Croatian defender Novoselec from converting the fifth kick, preventing a Punjab win.Greg Stewart then equalized for MBSG. As sudden death ensued, Melroy Assisi scored for Punjab FC. Subhashish Bose and Scottish defender Thomas Aldred , who scored the decisive penalty, converted for MBSG. Kaith's second save against Denechandram Meetei ultimately clinched the victory. Other MBSG scorers in the tiebreaker included Manvir Singh, Liston Colaco, and Dimi Petratos, while Vinit Rai, Norberto Vidal, Bakenga, and Filip Mrzljak scored for Punjab FC.A wonderful 1-2 between Luka and Vinit saw the latter in the clear inside the Mariners penalty area and as he was about to strike, Spanish central defender Alberto Martin was adjudged to have brought him down. The Shers’ talisman made no mistake with the spot-kick. The equaliser came at the stroke of half-time. Liston initiated it as he had been for the entire half with his forays down the left. On this occasion, he cut inside and laid it on for Greg Stewart whose first-time strike took a deflection off Suhail lurking just outside the six-yard box and wrongfooted Ravi to trickle in.Manvir was the first of the substitutes to make an immediate impact when Sahal set him up with a through ball on the right after having received a pass from the young and talented Abhishek. The lanky winger drew Ravi out of the Punjab goal and struck a right-footer past him into the right bottom corner.The goal forced Panagiotis to play his cards quickly and he brought on new Norwegian signing Bakenga ahead of the hour mark in place of skipper Luka Majcen. They got the equaliser minutes later when a Vinit Rai cross from the right was allowed to roll by hard-working Croatian midfielder Filip Mrzljak, foxing Aldred among others on the way. He then unleashed a thunderous left-footer from just outside the top of the box to bulge the Mariner’s net.Soon the Shers were back in the lead when Mrzljak again took control of a ball in midfield and made a dash forward. Bakenga produced the dummy run from the centre as the Croat found Vidal in the clear with his run from the left. The diminutive Argentine, who had come close just after coming on, this time beat Vishal Kaith with a clinical left-footer.It was then the turn of the Mariners to equalise as Liston’s cross was headed down by Manvir for Cummings to finish expertly with a left-footed volley which bulged the roof of the net. That led to the tie-breaker which resulted in heart-break for Punjab FC.",Defending champions Mohun Bagan Super Giant (MBSG) overcame Punjab FC 6-5 in sudden-death penalties.

NEW DELHI: Novak Djokovic , energized by his triumphant performance at the Olympic Games, aims to break new Grand Slam records at the US Open starting Monday. Meanwhile, his main rival, Jannik Sinner , arrives in New York facing scrutiny over two positive drug tests.If Djokovic secures a fifth title, he can become the oldest Open era champion at the tournament, sharing the record with Jimmy Connors, Pete Sampras, and Roger Federer.A victory would also elevate him to 25 Grand Slam triumphs, surpassing the 24 he currently shares with Margaret Court.This year has been challenging for Djokovic, as Sinner succeeded him as the Australian Open champion and took over his world number one ranking. Additionally, Carlos Alcaraz claimed Djokovic's French Open title and dominated him in a one-sided Wimbledon final.However, Djokovic made a remarkable comeback on the clay courts of Roland Garros, stunning Alcaraz in the Olympic final. His emotional victory in Paris allowed him to join an elite group of only five players to complete a career Golden Slam, winning all four majors and an Olympic gold medal.The victory silenced the growing number of skeptics who had dismissed the Serb as a fading force in a new era dominated by the 23-year-old Sinner and 21-year-old Alcaraz.Djokovic, who underwent knee surgery in June, described his Olympic victory as his ""biggest sporting success"" and the 99th title of his professional career.""At the age of 37 and facing a 21-year-old who is probably the best player in the world right now, winning Roland Garros and Wimbledon back-to-back, I can say that this is probably the biggest sporting success I have ever had,"" insisted Djokovic.Sinner, the rising Italian tennis star, enters the US Open, the final Grand Slam event of the year, fresh off his victory at the Cincinnati Masters. The young player's impressive performance on the court, however, was quickly overshadowed by recent revelations regarding his drug tests.Earlier in the season, Sinner tested positive on two separate occasions for clostebol, ""an anabolic agent prohibited at all times by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA)."" The news raised concerns about the athlete's integrity and the fairness of his competitions.Despite the positive tests, Sinner managed to avoid a prolonged suspension from the sport. Officials ultimately accepted his explanation that the banned substance had inadvertently entered his system due to contamination from a member of his support team.This decision allowed him to continue competing, but the incident has cast a shadow over his recent successes on the court.""I will now put this challenging and deeply unfortunate period behind me,"" said Sinner.","Novak Djokovic aims to break new Grand Slam records at the US Open starting Monday.

Why tennis star Jannik Sinner tested positive for steroids twice but faces no suspension,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/why-tennis-star-jannik-sinner-tested-positive-for-steroids-twice-but-faces-no-suspension/articleshow/112659493.cms,"NEW DELHI: Italian tennis star Jannik Sinner, currently ranked among the world's top players, faced a doping investigation after testing positive for a banned anabolic steroid in March 2023.While the positive tests resulted in the forfeiture of prize money and ranking points earned at the Indian Wells tournament, Sinner will not face suspension from professional tennis.The International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) announced on August 22nd that an independent tribunal determined Sinner's violation was unintentional. This decision follows a hearing held on August 15th, where evidence and testimonies were presented.Sinner, who achieved a career-high ranking of world No. 1 in June 2023, provided an explanation for the positive tests.He claimed that a member of his support team unknowingly used an over-the-counter spray containing Clostebol, a banned anabolic steroid, to treat a minor wound on Sinner. The same team member subsequently administered massages to Sinner, inadvertently leading to the contamination.The ITIA, after reviewing the evidence and accepting Sinner's explanation, concluded that the violation lacked intent.This determination, supported by the independent tribunal's findings, resulted in a ""No Fault or Negligence"" ruling, effectively clearing Sinner of intentional doping charges.The incident occurred during the Indian Wells tournament, where Sinner initially tested positive for low levels of Clostebol metabolites.A second positive test from an out-of-competition sample collected eight days later led to a provisional suspension, which was later lifted following Sinner's successful appeal.Despite the investigation and its impact on his Indian Wells results, Sinner has continued to excel on the court. He recently clinched the Cincinnati Open title and is considered a strong contender for the upcoming US Open .","Italian tennis star Jannik Sinner tested positive for a banned anabolic steroid in March 2023.
