Poll Should players be compared to legends like Virat Kohli? Yes, it motivates them No, it adds unnecessary pressure

Former Pakistan batter Ahmed Shehzad has come out strongly against the trend of comparing players, particularly Babar Azam , with modern-day great Virat Kohli . Speaking in an interview, Shehzad said that such comparisons are not only unfair but also add unnecessary pressure on players, which is visible in Babar’s current struggles.“When everything was going well, you were running campaigns comparing players. Now that the performances are not coming, you are saying ‘don’t compare two players’. Why not? Virat Kohli ’s comparison cannot be made with anyone in the world. He is a legend of this generation, a role model. You cannot compare him even with MS Dhoni . Dhoni may have been a great captain, but as a batter, cricketer, and athlete, Kohli stands alone. No one should be compared with anyone because it’s unfair and it adds extra pressure, which we are now seeing on Babar Azam,” Shehzad said.Babar’s dip in form has been a talking point for months. He has now gone 72 consecutive international innings without scoring a century, with his last hundred coming against Nepal. Since 2023, no other cricketer has endured a longer drought without a century.Adding to that, since 2024, Babar and Mohammad Rizwan are the only two batters from full-member nations with a strike rate below 80.The struggles have coincided with a change in leadership. Babar is no longer Pakistan’s captain across formats, having stepped down earlier this year following criticism over results and his own performances. The recent ODI series against West Indies only intensified the scrutiny, as Pakistan suffered a 202-run loss to concede their first bilateral ODI series to the Caribbean side in 34 years.Shehzad’s remarks highlight the pressure top players face when placed on the same pedestal as legends, and why the weight of public comparisons can often prove damaging to form and confidence.","Former Pakistan batter Ahmed Shehzad has come out strongly against the trend of comparing players, particularly Babar Azam, with modern-day great Virat Kohli.

A mother's instinct kicks in as symptoms spark a race against time

Inside the emergency room where doctors worked swiftly to stabilise baby Capri

Family turmoil, NFL commitments, and the one update fans needed to hear

Global fanbase rallies around the family as messages of support pour in

A late-night dash to the emergency room turned into a wave of relief for Miami Dolphins star Tyreek Hill’s family when his eight-month-old daughter, Capri, was admitted with sudden alarming symptoms. The little girl, shared with Hill’s estranged wife Keeta Vaccaro, had grown unusually warm, lethargic, and “not herself.” Quick-thinking calls and faster medical hands helped her bounce back, with doctors now calling her recovery a ‘positive turn’.Keeta Vaccaro shared the moment every parent dreads — the instant one knows something isn’t right. In her Instagram update, she described noticing Capri’s heavy eyes and warm skin before rushing to phone pediatrician Dr. Jared Friedman. Within minutes, hospital doors swung open and nurses had her baby hooked up for tests. “Last night was scary,” she admitted, her words carrying the weight of those anxious hours.Hospital photos showed Capri, wrapped in a light orange gown, clutching her blanket like a shield. Keeta thanked Dr. Friedman for calming her in the chaos, recalling his text: “We got this. We are a Team!” Blood work and viral panels were done swiftly, each step explained gently so a worried mother could breathe.By sunrise, Capri’s temperature had settled, and she was responding to treatment with more alertness and strength.The scare comes just months after Keeta filed for divorce in April, with Capri’s November 2024 birth marking a bright chapter in an otherwise turbulent year. Hill, sidelined from a Dolphins practice by an undisclosed injury, has not confirmed if he was at the ER. Still, Capri’s life has been well documented on Keeta’s feed — from six-month milestones to Sunday church visits — proof that love can remain the anchor when life turns rough.As Keeta’s post spread, thousands of followers jumped in to comfort her. “Glad she is ok!” one wrote, while another shared, “Oh no!!! I’m glad she is feeling better!” A third simply said, “Thank God she’s ok.” For many parents, it was a story that hit home — that late-night terror, the helpless waiting, the relief of seeing your child smile again.From a panic-filled midnight to a hopeful morning, Capri’s quick recovery has become the only headline that matters for the Hills. And for those who have followed Keeta’s journey, the sight of her daughter resting peacefully is more than news — it’s a shared moment of gratitude. In times like this, the power of family love and the kindness of a supportive community feel more real than ever. Across the globe, fans continue to send prayers and warm wishes, reminding the young family they're not alone in this fight.Although Tyreek Hill and Keeta Vaccaro are separated and navigating a difficult divorce, their shared love for Capri remains the unbreakable bond that keeps them connected as family above all else. In every whispered prayer and hopeful glance toward the future, that love shines through- reminding us all that even in hardship, family endures.And for Keeta, that night will forever be proof that a mother's strength rises highest when her child needed her most. For Tyreek, it was a quiet remainder that fatherhood's truest measure came in moments of presence and care. Capri's smile the next morning was perhaps the clearest sign yet that brighter days were on their way- and that both her parents, despite everything, would always stand guard over her heart. In that shared love, they found a fragile but unbreakable hope that would guide them through whatever lay ahead.Together, they learned that love, even in its quietest forms, holds the power to heal wounds, mend fears, and light the darkest paths with unwavering faith. And in that simple truth, they discovered a strength deeper than any hardship-a love fierce enough to carry them through every storm. Their bond stood strong, a light through every storm and though their paths eventually diverged, its glow remains in the corners of their hearts.Also Read: Disney’s ESPN strikes landmark deal to buy NFL Network — league grabs 10% stake in blockbuster swap","Tyreek Hill's daughter, Capri, rushed to ER with 'unusual' symptoms.

Joy Taylor opens up about getting “fired” from FOX Sports amid dealing with the scandalous lawsuit



What’s Next for Joy Taylor After Leaving Fox Sports?

Why was Joy Taylor sued along with Charlie Dixon and Emmanuel Acho?

Joy Taylor, the former Fox Sports’ executive, has had a pretty tough year after she got involved in a scandalous legal lawsuit earlier this year. While the lawsuit is ongoing, Joy Taylor continued on with her job at Fox Sports’ Speak which she co-hosted with Keyshawn Johnson and Paul Pierce.

I will have something to say about it…when I can legally.”However, Joy Taylor strongly denied any connection between her lawsuit and getting fired from FOX Sports.The former FOX Sports executive added, ""I will say that that situation and that suit had nothing to do with the changes that happened at FS1. I mean, I think from a logical standpoint, everyone can just look at it and see what the changes were and that there were three shows that were cut.""For the unversed, earlier this year, Joy Taylor, Charlie Dixon and Emmanuel Acho had found themselves in a huge legal mess.Former FOX Sports’ employee Noushin Faraji had filed a lawsuit against them for “sexual misconduct”.As per the lawsuit filed by Noushin Faraji, apparently, Charlie Dixon had tried to get close to her even though she rejected his advances. This led Noushin Faraji to approach Joy Taylor but Taylor allegedly told her not to complain about it and “to get over it”.This allegedly led Noushin Faraji to uncover ongoing “inappropriate workplace sexual relationships” at FOX Sports. Noushin Faraji alleged that Joy Taylor also had such inappropriate relationship to “advance” in her career.Noushin Faraji ended up accusing Charlie Dixon of sexual battery and filed a lawsuit against Joy Taylor.However, Joy Taylor has strongly denied such claims and continues to maintain she is innocent.

Why This Matters for the Los Angeles Lakers

The Odds of This Trade Happening

Thecould be preparing for another bold roster shake-up, with reports suggesting the team may explore a trade that sendsto the Sacramento Kings in exchange for forwardand guard. The move would aim to build a more balanced lineup around newly-extended superstar Luka Doncic and NBA legend LeBron James.On August 2, the Los Angeles Lakers officially committed to a new era by signing Doncic to a three-year, $165 million contract extension. Now, with two of the league’s best playmakers on the floor, General Manager Rob Pelinka may look to complement them with versatile two-way talent rather than another ball-dominant guard. Austin Reaves delivered a career year in the 2024-25 season, showcasing his scoring and playmaking ability. However, his lack of defensive presence could make him a less-than-ideal fit alongside Doncic over a full season.Rishav Bhat of ClutchPoints noted the potential reasoning behind a move for Keegan Murray, writing: “Despite Murray being one of the brightest young players the Kings have, he has emerged as a trade candidate because he is also one of the only remaining trade assets on their roster.At 24 years old and on a modest $11.1 million salary, Murray offers rare upside, strong defense, secondary scoring, and a team-friendly contract that the Kings can make use of in pursuit of a bigger star. ”If the Kings seek a replacement for point guard De’Aaron Fox - traded to the San Antonio Spurs last season - Austin Reaves could fill that role. For the Los Angeles Lakers , Keegan Murray and Keon Ellis would bring complementary skills that could fit seamlessly with Doncic and James.The 6-foot-8 forward has emerged as one of Sacramento’s most promising young players. His combination of size, defensive versatility, and efficient scoring could help stabilize the Los Angeles Lakers’ frontcourt.Ellis, a 6-foot-6 undrafted shooting guard, became one of Sacramento’s breakout performers in 2024-25. His elite three-point shooting and defensive instincts make him an appealing target for Los Angeles.Ellis’ defensive rating and ability to stretch the floor could make him the ideal backcourt partner for Doncic, who thrives alongside high-efficiency shooters and defensive-minded guards.• Fit with Stars: Doncic and James already provide elite playmaking, so adding players who excel off the ball and on defense could balance the roster.• Defensive Boost: Murray and Ellis both offer strong defensive metrics, something the Lakers need after recent struggles on that end.• Youth and Upside: At 24 and 25, Murray and Ellis align with a long-term approach while still being ready to contribute immediately.Also read: NBA Trade News: Denver Nuggets Sign $578,577 Dallas Mavericks Rookie to Bolster Wing Depth and Improve Championship Odds While the concept makes sense for both sides in theory, there’s no indication talks are active.

Still, as the Lakers look to maximize Doncic’s prime years, surrounding him with versatile, defensive-minded talent may become a necessity sooner rather than later.",The Los Angeles Lakers could be preparing for another bold roster shake-up.

Vikings ’ inclusion of male cheerleaders sparks mixed reactions from fanbase

Antonio Brown’s history of polarizing behavior overshadows preseason buzz



Former NFL wide receiver Antonio Brown has stirred fresh controversy after publicly targeting one of the Minnesota Vikings’ newly appointed male cheerleaders. The incident comes at a time when the team’s decision to add male performers to its cheer squad has already divided fans, sparking discussions about tradition, inclusivity, and the evolving culture of the NFL.The Vikings recently confirmed that Blaize Shiek and Louie Conn would join their cheerleading roster for the 2025 season. The decision was presented as a step toward gender equality and representation within the organization, aligning with a growing trend of NFL teams adopting co-ed cheer squads.While many supporters applauded the move as progressive, others pushed back, arguing it clashed with long-standing game-day traditions. Some season ticket holders reportedly went as far as threatening to cancel their memberships over the change. This divide existed well before Antonio Brown’s remarks but has now been amplified by the former wideout’s public criticism, in which he tweeted, “F*ggot of the Day” alongside a video of Shiek.Antonio Brown, who enjoyed a 12-season NFL career and a Super Bowl victory, has built a reputation for courting controversy both during and after his playing days.His latest jab comes just as the Vikings have kicked off their preseason with a 20-10 win over the Houston Texans. The team is now preparing to face the New England Patriots and Tennessee Titans before opening their regular season against the Chicago Bears on September 8.Much of the preseason focus had been on the return of rookie quarterback J.J. McCarthy from a season-ending injury last year. However, Brown’s comments have shifted the conversation from on-field performance to a broader cultural clash.Also Read: “Overhyped and overrated”: Josh Allen’s wife Hailee Steinfeld faces harsh criticism from Dave Portnoy For many observers, the situation underscores the resistance that often accompanies change in sports culture.

After earning his pilot wings in WWII and becoming a second lieutenant, he survived capture by German forces and later escaped. He went on to fly 76 combat missions in the Korean War and served through the Vietnam era before retiring as a colonel in 1969.During the recent flight, Peterburs and his co-pilot performed an aerial roll, briefly flying upside down as the 100-year-old veteran waved from the cockpit. After landing, he described the moment as “exhilarating” and rich with memories.""It was a really exhilarating experience and brought back a lot of memories,"" he said.The veteran pilot also shared a powerful message for future generations. ""To maintain what we have today, you got to do your best. Do your best in whatever you endeavor.

Arrest video shows Sha’Carri Richardson verbally attacking boyfriend amid tense domestic violence confrontation with police present



Sha’Carri Richardson issued an apology to Christian Coleman



Newly released police bodycam footage has shed light on the July 27 arrest of Olympic gold medal sprinter Sha’Carri Richardson. The footage showed a tense verbal exchange with boyfriend and fellow U.S. track star Christian Coleman during an alleged domestic violence incident at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. The reigning 100m world champion, 25, was booked on a fourth-degree domestic violence charge after authorities reviewed surveillance footage that appeared to show her shoving Coleman into a column and throwing an object at him.In the video, Sha’Carri Richardson appears to react sharply when officers inform her they are investigating a possible assault. “Oh Christian, I assaulted you? I assaulted you?” she says, before accusing Coleman of assaulting her. She later claims, “I’m in a domestic violent relationship… I can show you proof!”While speaking on the phone during the encounter, Richardson declares, “So this is the position that Christian Coleman puts me into. Because he’s a coward and I don’t want anything to do with him from this point going forward.” She also tells him directly, “You’re a coward!”Richardson denies striking Coleman, explaining to police that she only retrieved headphones that belonged to her. “I haven’t hit him with anything, not at all,” she insists. Yet, security footage reviewed by officers reportedly shows her blocking his path, shoving him into a wall, and tossing an item toward his head.When told she is under arrest, Richardson appears stunned: “I’m under arrest right now? What for? Christian, are you serious right now? I didn’t assault him, I didn’t do anything wrong.” She is later seen asking officers, “Who’s going to bail me out?” before being taken into custody for more than 18 hours.Days after the footage surfaced, Richardson publicly apologized to Coleman on Instagram. “I apologize to Christian. He came into my life & gave me more than a relationship but a greater understanding of unconditional love from what I’ve experienced in my past,” she wrote. Admitting past trauma had made her “blind & blocked off” to giving and receiving love, she added, “My apologize should be just as loud as my actions — honestly louder. ”Coleman, the 2019 100m world champion, has declined to press charges. Speaking to reporters, he called the situation “sucky” but defended Richardson: “I don’t feel like she should have been arrested… She’s a human being and a great person. We’ve been really good teammates all year.”He praised her prowess and talent, describing her as “the best female athlete in the world” and expressing confidence she would “bounce back.”Also Read: Martina Navratilova joins reaction to viral claim on Baltimore Ravens and Elon Musk's Tesla proposal Richardson, who also won gold in the 4x100m relay at the Paris Olympics, says she is using this time for “self-reflection” and “help that will reflect who I truly am in my heart and in my spirit.” She is scheduled to defend her titles at the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo starting September 13.","Olympic sprinter Sha’Carri Richardson was arrested on July 27 at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport.

Lucknow Super Giants posted a heartwarming video on X showing Akash Deep’s return home after India’s thrilling 2-2 series draw in England. Riding in an open jeep, the fast bowler was greeted like a local hero, with garlands placed around his neck and flowers showered on him by cheering crowds lining the streets. The celebration reflected the pride of a community welcoming back one of its own after a career-defining performance.Akash’s journey in the 2025 Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy was nothing short of remarkable. Missing the series opener, he made an instant impact in Birmingham by taking a 10-wicket haul in his first match of the tour, turning the momentum in India’s favour.He finished the series with 13 wickets, consistently providing early breakthroughs and troubling England’s top order. His pace and precision, particularly when paired with Mohammed Siraj , became a crucial weapon for India.But it was not just his bowling that made headlines. At The Oval in the decisive fifth Test, Akash stepped up with the bat when promoted as a nightwatchman. His maiden Test half-century, a composed 66 off 94 balls, featured a vital 131-run stand with Yashasvi Jaiswal . That knock gave India the cushion they needed to clinch a six-run victory in one of the most dramatic finishes in recent history.Akash credited coach Gautam Gambhir for helping him realise his potential and perform under pressure.

The uncertainty over Sanju Samson ’s future with Rajasthan Royals has grown, with fresh reports indicating that the franchise is actively working on potential trade options for their captain. As reported by Cricbuzz, RR have reached out to mult ipl e IPL franchises to check if they are interested in acquiring the India wicketkeeper-batter. Lead owner Manoj Badale is said to be personally involved in the discussions.According to Cricbuzz, during these talks, Badale has even named specific players from other teams that the Royals would want in exchange for Samson. In the case of Chennai Super Kings , it is believed RR asked for either Ravindra Jadeja or Ruturaj Gaikwad as part of a swap. These demands are understood to be deal-breakers for CSK, who are not willing to release two of their most important players.Shivam Dube’s name has also been mentioned in some conversations, but Chennai are reportedly unwilling to part with the India all-rounder either. In fact, CSK officials are said to be reluctant to release any of their current players. This makes a direct swap between Samson and CSK seem unlikely at present, unless lengthy negotiations change the equation or Samson’s name comes up in the auction.However, there is no certainty that Samson will even enter the auction.RR are believed to be in serious trade talks with more than one team, and there is interest from several other franchises. This means another franchise could step in and finalise a deal before the auction stage.Samson, who has been with RR for several seasons and captained them in recent years, has reportedly made a formal request to the management for a move, stating that he wants to take his career in a new direction. Over the past seasons, there have been reports of differences between Samson and the team’s decision-makers.One point of tension was the Royals’ choice to release Jos Buttler before the last season while retaining Shimron Hetmyer . Samson had previously told Star Sports that letting Buttler go was one of the most difficult calls for him, and during a dinner with Buttler in the England series, he admitted he was still not over it.Despite these issues, Samson has avoided making any negative public comments about the franchise. In a recent podcast with R Ashwin, he said the Rajasthan Royals setup means a lot to him and spoke highly of Vaibhav Suryavanshi, the young left-handed batter who replaced him at the top of the order in the RR batting line-up.If a suitable trade does not materialise, Samson could still remain with Rajasthan Royals, as releasing or trading a player is entirely the franchise’s decision. The player’s role in this process is limited to making a formal request. For now, the situation remains open-ended, and it is clear that Samson’s next move will be one of the biggest talking points of the upcoming IPL off-season.",Sanju Samson's future with Rajasthan Royals is uncertain.

England cricket star Joe Root has dismissed Australian batter David Warner 's recent criticism about his batting technique as ""all part of the fun"" ahead of the upcoming Ashes series in Australia starting November 21. The comments come as England prepares for the crucial five-match tour following their 2-2 draw against India.The Ashes series holds significant importance for England's chances in the ICC World Test Championship final. England is also looking to secure their first Ashes victory in Australia since 2011 and their first overall since 2015.Warner had targeted Root's performance against Australian pacer Josh Hazlewood , stating: ""Josh Hazlewood tends to have his number quite a lot. He will have to take the surfboard off his front leg."" The comment referenced Root's record against Hazlewood, who has dismissed him 10 times in 31 innings at an average of 31.40.Speaking to Sky Sports Root responded to Warner's comments with composure, saying: ""Just that. I have no control over how people perceive the game or discuss it in an interview. Nothing new, is it? You know there are going to be storylines and people wanting to hype up a big series.Does not really change anything. It is sort of irrelevant to me. What can I do about it?

Deion Sanders’ divorce joke sparks laughter



Pilar Sanders beams with pride for NFL sons



In the Sanders family, drama is almost a generational trait—but when it comes to owning the spotlight, Deion Sanders still wears the crown. The NFL and MLB legend, now head coach of the Colorado Buffaloes, proved once again why his presence commands attention. A career defined by “Prime Time” moments on the field has seamlessly transitioned into “Coach Prime” headlines off it, often mixing humor, personal history, and an unapologetic flair for the dramatic.During a recent team meeting, offensive coordinator Pat Shurmur casually mentioned that Sunday marked his 35th wedding anniversary. Without missing a beat, Deion delivered the kind of line only he could pull off: “Sunday was my celebration of my second divorce.” The room erupted in laughter, with the Hall of Famer raising his fist in mock celebration. For those who know the history between Deion and his second ex-wife, Pilar Sanders, the jab was vintage Coach Prime—sharp, self-deprecating, and impossible to ignore.Their divorce was anything but quiet, often making headlines for its tense nature. Reports even suggested the pair avoided each other at Colorado games despite Pilar attending regularly to cheer for their children—Shilo, Shedeur, and Shelomi.Still, Deion’s rumored relationship with actress Karrueche Tran, who stood by him during his cancer battle, hints that love isn’t entirely off the table for the coach.Despite the fractured marriage, Pilar’s role as a mother has remained front and center. She made the rounds recently to witness both Shilo’s NFL debut with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Shedeur’s preseason appearance with the Cleveland Browns. After Shilo’s strong performance in a 27-9 win over the Titans, he offered his game-worn jersey to his father. Deion, in classic fashion, declined—joking that a Hall of Famer expects “like 30 times more. ”The jersey instead went to Pilar, who proudly displayed it, much to her son’s delight. Shilo summed it up perfectly on camera: “Shout out to my mom for coming… you have my jersey.”From sideline quips to family milestones, Deion Sanders remains a master at blending personal stories with headline-making charisma—proving once again that for the Sanders family, football is only part of the show.Also Read: ‘The Life of a Showgirl’: Taylor Swift drops release date, complete tracklist and gorgeous album cover details on New Heights Podcast","Deion Sanders made a joke about his divorce during a Colorado team meeting.

Trey Hendrickson's contract dispute threatens Cincinnati Bengals ’ defense

Joe Burrow Disappointed With Bengals Offense, Discusses Trey Hendrickson & Shemar Stewart Holdouts

Cincinnati must fix Hendrickson dispute to protect Joe Burrow ’s prime and title hopes



The Cincinnati Bengals face a growing dilemma as star pass rusher Trey Hendrickson remains without a new contract. Despite attending practices and mentoring rookie first-round pick Shemar Stewart, Hendrickson isn’t participating in team drills. With the season fast approaching, his absence from full action could prove costly for a team built to contend for a Super Bowl.Hendrickson has been one of the NFL’s most dominant edge rushers over the past two seasons, racking up an impressive 17.5 sacks in each campaign. On the open market, his production would command well over $30 million annually, nearly double the $16 million he’s set to earn this year. He’s still under contract, leaving him to either wait out the Bengals or force a trade.ESPN analyst Louis Riddick didn’t hold back on Get Up, criticizing Cincinnati’s front office for letting the standoff linger. He warned that failing to secure key players like Hendrickson “contributes to wasting the prime of franchise quarterback Joe Burrow” and puts the Bengals at risk of falling behind elite NFL contenders.Burrow, already established as one of the league’s best quarterbacks, has elite weapons in Ja’Marr Chase, Tee Higgins, and promising running back Chase Brown.However, the defense’s inconsistency last season, even with Hendrickson on the field, was a major factor in Cincinnati missing the playoffs.Without Hendrickson disrupting opposing quarterbacks, the Bengals’ defense could become a glaring weakness once again. His ability to collapse pockets and generate game-changing plays is crucial to keeping Cincinnati in the conversation for the Super Bowl.With Joe Burrow, the Bengals have a rare franchise quarterback who can keep them in the Super Bowl hunt. But in the NFL, a quarterback’s prime doesn’t last forever, and championship windows close quickly. If Trey Hendrickson’s contract standoff drags on, defensive weaknesses could once again derail Cincinnati’s elite offensive potential.Also Read: Andy Reid’s honest confession about Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce as ‘The Life of a Showgirl’ album becomes NFL talking point Cincinnati must act decisively, whether that means extending Hendrickson’s deal or finding a fair trade; they cannot afford to let this standoff derail their season.

Mikael Pyyhtiä re-signs with Columbus Blue Jackets after gaining valuable NHL experience



Mikael Pyyhtiä’s international experience with Team Finland and career background since 2020 NHL Draft

The Columbus Blue Jackets have secured forward Mikael Pyyhtiä on a one-year, two-way contract for the upcoming season. The deal carries an NHL cap hit of $775,000, with a minor-league salary of $100,000 and $140,000 guaranteed. The 23-year-old Finnish winger, a 2020 fourth-round pick, is coming off his entry-level contract and looks to build on his increased NHL role from last season.Columbus general manager Don Waddell confirmed the signing on Wednesday, praising Pyyhtiä’s speed, reliable two-way game, and work ethic. Waddell expressed confidence that the winger will continue to develop within the Blue Jackets’ system.After establishing himself in Finland’s Liiga with TPS, Pyyhtiä transitioned to North American hockey late in the 2022–23 season, splitting time between Columbus and their AHL affiliate, the Cleveland Monsters. Last season, he saw his NHL role expand significantly, appearing in 47 games with the Blue Jackets. He scored his first NHL goal on Oct. 28 against the Edmonton Oilers, finishing with four goals, three assists, and a minus-11 rating while averaging over 12 minutes of ice time.In the AHL, Pyyhtiä had a standout stretch, producing a career-high 28 points (7 goals, 21 assists) in 28 games with Cleveland.Pyyhtiä’s progress earned him a spot on Finland’s roster for the 2025 IIHF Men’s World Championship, where he played three games.Though he didn’t record a point in that tournament, he previously captured gold with Finland at the 2021 IIHF World Junior Championship, underscoring his international pedigree.Drafted 114th overall in the 2020 NHL Draft, the Turku native is regarded as a strong skating winger with dependable defensive play and growing offensive confidence. His two-way contract structure ensures flexibility for the Blue Jackets, allowing him to contribute at both the NHL and AHL levels depending on team needs.By re-signing Mikael Pyyhtiä, the Blue Jackets maintain a promising young forward who has already shown he can handle extended NHL minutes. With his blend of speed, defensive reliability, and offensive upside, Pyyhtiä will aim to solidify his spot in the Columbus lineup as the team pushes toward improvement in the 2025–26 season.Also Read: Winnipeg Jets yet to make progress on Kyle Connor contract extension as star winger nears 2025–26 NHL free agency","Mikael Pyyhtiä re-signs with Columbus Blue Jackets on a one-year, two-way contract.

OnlyFans model alleged that Shannon Sharpe wanted “control” over her body in the $50 million lawsuit



Shannon Sharpe maintains that everything that happened between him and the OnlyFans model was “consensual”



Shannon Sharpe is trying to stay out of the spotlight ever since he has been able to settle the lawsuit with the 20 year old OnlyFans model who alleged that she was sexually assaulted by him. While Shannon Sharpe deals with fans trolling him and getting fired from ESPN, new details of the lawsuit filed against him show the relationship he shared with the young woman was pretty toxic.In April of this year, the 20 year old OnlyFans model who adopted the pseudonym Jane Doe, filed a $50 million lawsuit against Shannon Sharpe.While the $50 million lawsuit does detail horrific details of the alleged sexual assault that occured, the woman has also accused Shannon Sharpe of “threatening her”.According to People, the lawsuit states that at one point Shannon Sharpe became violent towards the 20 year old OnlyFans model. But that’s not all; allegedly, Shannon Sharpe also threatened to “kill her” when she showed up late to his place.The lawsuit states, ""He demanded complete control over her time and body, expecting her to be at his house on his schedule, at his command, whenever he called.”As per her 13 page complaint against Shannon Sharpe, the 20 year old OnlyFans model stated that, “After many months of manipulating and controlling Plaintiff — a woman more than thirty years younger than he — and repeatedly threatening to brutally choke and violently slap her…”Shannon Sharpe has maintained that the two were in a highly sexual relationship with one another where the two frequently engaged in role play and BDSM.The NFL legend alleged that he has been “trapped” by the 20 year old OnlyFans model.Despite denying such horrific allegations, Shannon Sharpe, the 57 year old NFL legend, did end up paying $23 million to the OnlyFans model, in order to settle the lawsuit.The settlement has now raised many eyebrows on whether Shannon Sharpe is innocent but the NFL legend has remained silent on it.As of now, Shannon Sharpe has been fired from ESPN but continues to get trolled by fans due to his affair with the 20 year old OnlyFans model.Also Read: Shannon Sharpe allegedly filmed s*x acts with 20-year-old OnlyFans model and shared them without consent","The 20 year old OnlyFans model who adopted the pseudonym Jane Doe, filed a $50 million lawsuit against Shannon Sharpe.

The NFL regular season is almost here, but before fantasy football managers and die-hard fans can fully lock in their game-day plans, there’s one looming hurdle, injuries. From star quarterbacks like Matthew Stafford to fantasy-relevant wideouts like AJ Brown, Brandon Aiyuk, and Chris Godwin, several big names are dealing with health issues just days before kickoff. These updates aren’t just gossip, they could make or break early-season performances, roster decisions, and fantasy outcomes. Here’s the latest breakdown on who’s ready, who’s at risk, and who might be better off stashed on the IR.– The veteran QB is trending toward playing, but reports of an epidural treatment hint at a possible disc herniation. While he’s expected to suit up, there’s a higher-than-normal re-injury risk.– Suffered a minor injury to his non-throwing hand. The issue is considered low concern and shouldn’t affect throwing, though handoffs could feel uncomfortable early on.– Nursing a pinky injury that may have slightly impacted his preseason accuracy. Still, team sources expect no performance dip when Week 1 rolls around.– Dealing with a minor issue and carrying about a 5% re-aggravation risk.He remains on track for Week 1 without any downgrade in fantasy value.– Seen with a wrap on his thigh, which suggests a mild groin or hamstring tweak. Low concern heading into the opener.– Expected back around mid-October (Week 6) after his injury. Fantasy managers should anticipate a slow ramp-up in production once he returns.– His oblique issue shouldn’t impact Week 1, but an earlier wrist injury could still be worth monitoring.– Facing a mild drop in expected production with moderate re-injury risk.– Battling a high ankle sprain. Historical data suggests about a 20% performance dip for the first 4–6 weeks after return.– Status is leaning toward missing Week 1 after undergoing two offseason surgeries.– Likely recovering from an AC joint sprain. Medical trends point to a strong chance he’s ready for Week 1.– Could see a dip in volume along with elevated re-injury risk.– Expected to be active in Week 1 but may need a month to get back to full speed.– Rehab is progressing well, making a Week 1 return very likely.– Groin injury isn’t expected to limit him in the opener.– Carries a slightly higher-than-usual soft tissue injury risk.– Underwent meniscus trimming surgery. Should be ready by Week 1 or Week 2.– Projected return is between Week 2–4, with some performance dip expected in the first month.Week 1 is shaping up to be a high-stakes guessing game for coaches and fantasy managers alike. While many stars are on track to play, some will be limited or sidelined, and the first couple of games could tell us a lot about how these injuries linger. Keep your eye on injury reports daily because one tweak in practice could flip the script entirely.Also read - Caitlin Clark joins the internet in freaking out over Taylor Swift’s New Heights episode","The NFL regular season is almost here, but before fantasy football managers and die-hard fans can fully lock in their game-day plans, there’s one looming hurdle, injuries.

Cowboys documentary sheds light on hidden chapter of Jerry Jones’ life



For more than ten years, Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones carried a secret far from the bright lights of the NFL stage. The 82-year-old recently revealed that he had been diagnosed with stage 4 melanoma back in 2010—a fight that involved multiple surgeries, experimental drugs, and a battle against steep odds. His disclosure came after the Dallas Morning News picked up on a subtle reference in Netflix’s upcoming America’s Team: The Gambler and His Cowboys, set to premiere Aug. 19.Jerry Jones said his life was saved by a groundbreaking immunotherapy drug known as PD-1, paired with expert medical care at Houston’s MD Anderson Cancer Center. “I was saved by a fabulous treatment and great doctors and a real miracle [drug] called PD-1 [therapy],” Jones told the Dallas Morning News. “I went into trials for that PD-1 and it has been one of the great medicines. I now have no tumors.”His journey was far from simple. Over the decade, Jones underwent two lung surgeries and two lymph node surgeries while navigating the emotional toll of a stage 4 diagnosis. According to the Melanoma Research Alliance, this is the most advanced stage, where cancer cells have spread beyond the skin to other parts of the body.The American Cancer Society estimates that the five-year survival rate for stage 4 melanoma hovers around 35%, though recent drug advancements have significantly improved outcomes.Jones’ survival stands as a testament to how medical innovation can rewrite even the most daunting prognoses. Studies, such as one from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, now suggest survival rates for advanced cases can approach 50%—a leap forward that Jones experienced firsthand.The revelation emerged from a surprising source—a Netflix docuseries chronicling the Cowboys’ highs and lows during Jones’ tenure. In the fifth episode, he drops a passing remark about undergoing cancer treatments “about a dozen years ago.” That offhand comment prompted deeper questions from the Dallas Morning News, ultimately leading to his candid admission.The series, filmed over two years with more than 40 hours of interviews, not only captures the legendary owner’s business acumen but also the personal resilience that shaped him. In one memorable scene, Jones humorously recalls a doctor’s advice to meditate on people who irritate him—starting with former coach Jimmy Johnson. “I can’t get past that first mother…,” he quips, underscoring how his trademark wit endured even in the face of illness.Jerry Jones’ story adds a new layer to his public legacy—one not defined solely by football trophies and franchise decisions, but by a battle fought in silence, and won with determination and grit.Also Read: How long will the Packers be without Jordan Love after his thumb ligament injury and surgery?","Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones recently revealed he was diagnosed with stage 4 melanoma in 2010.

Chicago Blackhawks training camp and rookie evaluations to build competitive NHL roster

Jeff Blashill is set to lead Chicago Blackhawks, focusing on developing the team’s young roster and building a culture of competitiveness. With an emphasis on player growth, fundamentals, and long-term success, Blashill aims to transform potential into performance, guiding the NHL franchise toward sustained progress and giving fans a clear sense of the team’s future direction.Blashill brings extensive NHL experience, having spent three seasons as an assistant with Tampa Bay and seven years as head coach of the Detroit Red Wings (2015–2022). In Detroit, he led the team to the playoffs in his first season but missed postseason play in subsequent years, finishing with a record of 204-261-72 over 537 games. His focus on fundamentals and player development aligns with the Blackhawks’ current emphasis on nurturing young talent.Speaking ahead of the 2026 season, Blashill emphasized the importance of growth: “The reality is our growth will be based on how quickly our young guys mature. Not only how they mature physically, but more importantly, how their games mature.”Training camp, scheduled for September 15–19, 2025, will introduce Blashill’s system. Rookies participating in the Tom Kurvers Prospect Tournament in Minnesota will arrive early for workouts and evaluations.On-ice sessions will focus on smart skating, puck control, rapid transitions, and explosive first steps—key skills for both defensive recovery and generating offensive opportunities.“It shows how willing our team is to work. And it’s one of the best ways to create transition offense—being smothering in your effort to come back as forwards. That allows your defensemen to gap up, create turnovers, and go the other way,” Blashill explained.Also Read: Trophy over Wifey: Brad Marchand reveals true priority as he kisses Stanley Cup before wife in Florida Panthers celebration; Wife later reacts With a young and developing roster, implementing these systems will be challenging, but Jeff Blashill’s emphasis on fundamentals, player growth, and cultural transformation could help cultivate a competitive NHL team.","Blashill brings extensive NHL experience, having spent three seasons as an assistant with Tampa Bay and seven years as head coach of the Detroit Red Wings.

Kyrie’s Pick: Kevin Durant

Why Durant Stands Out for Kyrie Irving

The 7/11 Connection

Kyrie Irving’s Star-Studded Teammate List

’s career has been defined by partnerships with some of basketball’s biggest names. He shared the court with LeBron James , leading Cleveland to an unforgettable 2016 NBA title, and now runs the offense alongside Luka Doncic in Dallas. But when asked to name the greatest teammate he’s ever had, Irving surprised many by bypassing both of those superstars.During a recent Twitch live stream, Irving was asked to reflect on his most remarkable on-court partnership. Instead of choosing one of his championship or current teammates, he singled out Kevin Durant , his former Brooklyn Nets co-star.“The 7/11 duo of me & KD will never be topped in terms of just being on the court with somebody that special. I played with a lot of great players, but playing with KD was OD (overdose),” Irving said. Kyrie Irving ’s time with LeBron James was historic, particularly the 2016 Finals Game 7, where his clutch three-pointer helped clinch Cleveland’s first NBA championship. Yet, their partnership came with challenges, including contrasting leadership approaches and the weight of championship expectations.Luka Doncic, Irving’s current running mate, has dazzled fans with his skill and vision, but their time together is still in its early stages.In contrast, Irving says the chemistry with Durant felt unmatched, even though their run was shorter than expected.Formed in Brooklyn, the “7/11” duo showcased a fluid, high-powered style of basketball that mesmerized fans. Injuries, off-court issues, and roster changes limited them to just 74 combined games in the regular season and playoffs. Still, Irving describes those moments as special—filled with freedom, creativity, and an unspoken understanding on the court.• LeBron James – Four-time MVP and one of the game’s all-time greats.• Luka Doncic – Rising superstar and perennial All-NBA talent.• Jayson Tatum & Jaylen Brown – Core of Boston’s championship pursuits.• James Harden – Former MVP and elite offensive force.Despite this elite company, Irving says Durant set the standard for what it feels like to truly click with a teammate.Also read: Why the Golden State Warriors are Interested in $60 Million Boston Celtics Big Man to Bolster Stephen Curry and Jonathan Kuminga’s Supporting Cast For Kyrie Irving, greatness in a teammate isn’t solely measured by trophies—it’s about connection, trust, and the joy of playing the game at its purest.","Kyrie Irving was asked to name the greatest teammate he’s ever had.

Balancing Kuminga’s Future

Possible Challenges for the Warriors

The NBA offseason is a feast for those looking for trade talks. A recent debate frames the Golden State Warriors as they pursuit former Boston Celtics veteran Al Horford. The 39-year-old center, a five-time All-Star and NBA champion, could soon swap Celtic green for the Warriors’ blue and gold - a move that speaks volumes about Golden State’s mindset as they chase another title behind the legendary Stephen Curry and the rising Jonathan Kuminga.According to Anthony Slater, Horford is in no rush to make a decision and has other opportunities to consider, including the possibility of retirement. “Horford is comfortable waiting. Retirement remains on the table, sources said, though the Warriors appear to be operating as if he is a firm part of their plan next season,” wrote Emilio Abad.If a deal goes through, Al Horford would likely become the Golden State Warriors ’ starting center, giving Draymond Green more rest during the regular season. His passing, defensive versatility, and floor-spacing ability from the five spot could address a long-standing need for Golden State.At 39, Horford is not expected to play heavy minutes every night. Instead, the Warriors would aim to keep him fresh for high-leverage games, creating lineup flexibility and opening lanes for Kuminga’s aggressive style of play.The Golden State Warriors’ interest in Horford is closely tied to their long-term vision for Kuminga.Pairing a seasoned center with the 21-year-old forward could be crucial to unlocking his full potential. However, moving on from Kuminga now would undermine that strategy.If Al Horford joins, his presence could also benefit young centers like Quentin Post and Trayce Jackson-Davis, offering them a first-hand look at the preparation, leadership, and professionalism required at the highest level.Bringing in Horford could reduce minutes for Post and Jackson-Davis, potentially slowing their on-court development. Still, the Warriors believe these concerns could be managed throughout the season, particularly if the team emerges as a legitimate contender.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Golden State Warriors Reportedly Eyeing $54 Million Boston Celtics Center to Bolster Squad Around Stephen Curry and Jimmy Butler The league-wide consensus is that if Horford forgoes retirement, the Warriors remain his likely landing spot - a potential “missing piece” for both the NBA’s most watchable star (Curry) and a hungry new generation in Kuminga.In sum, the Warriors’ pursuit of Horford isn’t just about plugging a roster hole. It’s a strategic, legacy-minded move: adding a “big man” who commands respect across the league could energize a core desperate to match the championships of the Warriors dynasty. For a team built on splash and swagger, adding Horford would be a grand move in the quest for yet another trip to the NBA mountaintop.","The Golden State Warriors are interested in signing former Boston Celtics center Al Horford.
