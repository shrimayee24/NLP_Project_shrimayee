Chawla shared his thoughts on Shubhankar Mishra's podcast, calling both young batters ""special players.""Kohli and Rohit recently retired from T20Is after India's 2024 T20 World Cup win but are still available for Tests and ODIs.Rohit is 37, and Kohli will be 36 in November, indicating the end of their careers is near.Chawla pointed to Gill’s strong technique as a key strength. ""Shubman Gill—because of his technique. Whenever one goes through poor form, a batter who is technically strong can come out of it. Any batter who has a good technique cannot stay out of form for too long. So, Shubman Gill for sure and Ruturaj Gaikwad,"" Chawla said.Gill, 25, has become a key player for India, with 25 Tests, 47 ODIs, and 21 T20Is under his belt. He has scored 1,492 runs in Tests, 2,338 in ODIs, and 578 in T20Is, including four Test centuries, six ODI centuries (one double century), and one T20I century.Gaikwad, 27, has faced injuries and selection issues but still received praise from Chawla. ""It [getting dropped or injured] is part and parcel of the game. It will keep happening. But, whenever he has got the opportunity, he has looked different. For me, these two players (Gill and Gaikwad) are special,"" Chawla added.Gaikwad has played six ODIs and 23 T20Is, scoring 115 and 633 runs, respectively, with one T20I century.With Kohli and Rohit nearing retirement, Gill and Gaikwad provide hope for the future of Indian cricket","Piyush Chawla believes Shubman Gill and Ruturaj Gaikwad can take over from Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma when they retire from international cricket.

He highlighted Rohit's steadfast loyalty and the tireless effort he put forth for the team's success.Chawla emphasized how Rohit's leadership played a crucial role in guiding Mumbai Indians to numerous victories.In the 2023 IPL season, Chawla showcased his prowess on the field, securing 22 wickets across 16 matches.His impressive performance placed him as the fourth-highest wicket-taker throughout the season.The spinner shared an anecdote from the season, revealing an instance when Rohit summoned him to his room at the unusual hour of 2:30 AM.""I've played so much cricket with him that we've reached a comfort level. We sit off-the-field as well. Once, at 2:30 in the night, he texted me and asked, ""you up?"" He drew a field on paper and discussed with me about potentially dismissing Warner. Even at that time, he was thinking about how he could get the best out of me,"" Chawla told Shubhankar Mishra on YouTube.Chawla stressed that Rohit's influence extends beyond his role as a captain, highlighting his leadership qualities. He referred to instances from the ODI World Cup held last year and the recent T20 World Cup to support his point.""There's a captain, then there's a leader. He isn't a captain, he is a leader. Whether it was 2023 ODI WC, or the 2024 T20 WC, the way he batted, he sets the tone in such a way that he made it easy for next batters. He's a true leader. He gives you a free hand,"" said Chawla.Rohit-led Indian team ended the decade-long ICC title drought after beating South Africa in the final of the T20 World Cup 2024 to lift their second title in the format.

ISL-11 opener: Familiar foes back in business,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/indian-super-league/top-stories/isl-11-opener-familiar-foes-back-in-business/articleshow/113308011.cms,"KOLKATA: For a league which is yet to reach its teen and celebrating merely its 11th birthday, the rivalry between Mohun Bagan SG and Mumbai City FC is fast becoming the face of Indian Super League . If there’s one showdown that elevates a match of 90 minutes to a drama of fluctuating fortunes, this is it. If there’s one fixture which always sets two teams at loggerheads with each other raising the bar and gaining a foothold in the title march with all its emotional and volcanic airs, this is it.Their duopoly of last season’s league is still fresh in many minds.If Mohun Bagan pipped Mumbai City to their maiden Winners’ Shield, the Islanders had their revenge on their way to clinching their second ISL Cup, bearding the green-and-maroon lion in their den.However, as the two sides, champions in their own rights, are kick-starting a new season of the league five months down the line, the contest at the Salt Lake Stadium on Friday may not be so much about its distinctive, title-defining noise, but both will look to make a I-mean-business statement.Mohun Bagan’s newly-appointed coach Jose Molina, though, is not a man willing to live in the past.“For me, it will be a new match, absolutely different to the last ISL final. We have to work in the present and the only thing that exists in my brain is Mumbai City,” the Spaniard, who once guided now defunct ATK to their ISL title in 2016, told a news conference on Thursday.By Molina’s own admission, Indian football has since changed a lot. So are his Mohun Bagan and rivals Mumbai.New recruit and Australian league all-time leading scorer Jamie Maclaren is yet to complete a full training session with the first team and stays out of reckoning for theISL-11 opener .But it’s not his attack — where his wealth of options is anybody’s envy — where lies a spot of bother. If the Durand Cup is any yardstick, Bagan’s defensive fragility requires immediate attention from the coach.Molina insisted that since all teams are in pre-season mode and yet to be at their best physically, early setbacks should be accepted as an integral part of a learning curve.Mohun Bagan will welcome a fit Spanish centre-back Alberto Rodriguez but Mumbai are capable of testing the home team’s defence with quick wing-play.Petr Kratky’s visitors may have lost Apuia to Bagan in the transfer window, but in Lallianzuala Chhangte, Vikram Partap Singh and newcomer Brandon Fernandes, they have quite a game-changing domestic stars. In Spanish playmaker Jon Toral and Greek attacker Nikos Karelis, they are also building a new side ready to make a mark.Aware of Mumbai’s threat, Molina said: “The plan is to defend as a whole team. We need to defend and attack together and try to see that they don’t have the ball for a long time. Their wingers are dangerous, but they have other players who can be dangerous too.”Unlike in the past, this is sort of a juncture match. Their rivalry now resumes with a tournament-opener but, make no mistake, those old vibes of one-upmanship and competitiveness will be there in plenty to define this contest as well.","Mohun Bagan SG and Mumbai City FC meet in the opening match of the Indian Super League. Bagan won the ISL last season, while Mumbai won their second ISL Cup. Jose Molina's side will welcome a fit Alberto Rodriguez to the Salt Lake Stadium.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113308296,imgsize-73484,width-400,resizemode-4/113308296.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Former Indian cricketer Dinesh Karthik has expressed doubts about Bangladesh 's ability to challenge India in the upcoming Test series, despite Bangladesh's recent success in Pakistan. Speaking on India's prospects on Cricbuzz, Karthik emphasized that winning against India on home soil is a significant challenge.""I personally don't think so.

So, it's a good team,"" Karthik said.Karthik also suggested that India might prepare pace-friendly pitches for the series, which would help against Bangladesh and serve as preparation for the upcoming series against Australia.""I get the feeling India's going to play on slightly pace-oriented pitches, knowing that it's a good way to beat Bangladesh.

This issue has also been a significant factor in his exclusion from the national team. Moin Khan , a former wicketkeeper-batter for Pakistan and the father of Azam, has spoken out against Ramiz Raja , the ex-chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board ( PCB ).Moin holds Ramiz responsible for hindering his son's progress in cricket, specifically pointing to the contentious decision to exclude Azam from the squad prior to the T20 World Cup in 2021.""In the 2022 (2021) World Cup, Azam was also selected for the team, but Ramiz Raja dropped him. At that time, if the chief selector had made a wrong selection, he should have been removed, but they didn't have the courage, and as a result, they demoralized a young player. In this World Cup as well, you can see how he played,"" Moin told Cricket Pakistan.Moin also expressed his disapproval regarding the choice to drop Azam from the squad after a single game. The promising wicketkeeper-batsman failed to score in the match against USA, which resulted in Pakistan's unexpected loss.""I watched the entire World Cup and the matches leading up to it, and it seemed like Azam was the number one choice for wicketkeeping and batting. Then suddenly, after just one match, the entire strategy was changed. Azam wasn't given a chance to keep wickets after one match and was dropped after getting out on the very first ball,"" he said .However, Moin emphasized that Azam needs to become ""physically and mentally"" stronger to maintain his performance at the highest level.""I'm not saying that all the blame lies with the team management and the captain; Azam has his own shortcomings too. He needs to make himself physically and mentally stronger, follow the fitness routines of other sportsmen.

Sunil Gavaskar slams Michael Vaughan on 'Joe Root surpassing Sachin Tendulkar' comment,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/sunil-gavaskar-slams-michael-vaughan-on-joe-root-surpassing-sachin-tendulkar-comment/articleshow/113287617.cms,"NEW DELHI: Citing recent remarks regarding the prospect of Joe Root overtaking Sachin Tendulkar as the top run-scorer in men's Test cricket, legendary opener Sunil Gavaskar stated that the aggressive response to India's attacks must be given.It is only a matter of time till Root emerges as the top run-getter in Test matches, former England captain Michael Vaughan had said on an episode of the Club Prairie Fire podcast.In addition, he stated that the BCCI would use every resource at its disposal to guarantee that an Indian batter maintains the record.""I can say with experience of more than 50 years that it's not just the Indian crowds who are silent when their team is not doing well but crowds in every country. If there is some noise when, say, India is doing well overseas, it's because of the number of Indian supporters who travel long distances from India and who cheer for them and not the locals.""So next time, when some commentator or media person from overseas tries to talk about the silence of the Indian crowd when India is not doing well, we should ask them why their supporters haven't come to cheer for their team. This business of India bashing has to be countered with aggression because that's the only language they understand.""Recently, I heard someone saying it would be good for Test cricket if Joe Root overtook Sachin Tendulkar's record for most runs and centuries in Test match cricket. Please tell us what's wrong with Test cricket presently when Tendulkar is owning the record and how will Test cricket be better if (and that's a huge if) an Englishman goes on to hold it. In what way will it be better? Kindly enlighten us,"" wrote Gavaskar in his column for Sportstar on Thursday as per IANS.He was taken aback by the statement that the BCCI dislikes Test cricket, even though India plays a lot of red-ball cricket each year. ""For some strange reason, there's a perception overseas that BCCI does not like Test cricket.""That's a ridiculous notion, as India play more than half a dozen Test matches every season, be it at home or away. Just because the IPL is massively successful doesn't mean BCCI is not interested in promoting Test cricket, but that's the narrative that's being peddled by the overseas media.""Gavaskar concluded by advising everyone to keep an eye on whether Lord's will still serve as the location for the World Test Championship final in 2025. ""The ICC just announced that the WTC final will be played at Lord's next June. Well, we have heard the same declaration twice earlier, but as soon as it's seen that England is not going to qualify for the final, the venue gets changed to Southampton or The Oval in London.""Now that England is winning more Test matches in this period and there's a good chance that they may get to the final, we are being told the final will be at Lord's. Let's wait and see. As the old Indian saying goes, DILLI (Lord's) abhi bhi door hai.""","Sunil Gavaskar says aggressive response to India's attacks must be given.

They’ll be difficult because before they were saying, ‘we are playing the NorthEast (NEUFC)’ but now they say, ‘NorthEast are coming for us’. They’ll be warned about us.

NEW DELHI: In September 2020, Manchester United pulled off one of the most dramatic Premier League wins with a 3-2 victory over Brighton at the Amex Stadium.Referee Chris Kavanagh initially ended the match, but moments later, VAR intervened, prompting one of the strangest conclusions to a game in recent memory.The controversy began when Harry Maguire ’s header struck Neal Maupay 's outstretched arm in the box.Referee Kavanagh, having already blown the final whistle, was advised by VAR to review the incident.After consulting the pitchside monitor, Kavanagh overturned his initial decision and awarded Manchester United a penalty.In the 100th minute, Bruno Fernandes stepped up to the spot and coolly slotted the ball into the top-right corner, securing United’s 3-2 win.It was the last kick of the game, as the International Football Association Board (IFAB) rules allow the extension of time for penalty kicks even after the whistle had been blown.If Brighton’s goalkeeper had saved the shot, any rebound attempt wouldn’t have counted.The chaotic finale overshadowed a thrilling match in which Brighton had struck the woodwork five times and thought they had secured a point when Solly March equalized deep into added time. However, the late penalty snatched the result away, leaving Brighton and their manager Graham Potter bitterly disappointed.Potter lamented, “I don't know where the extra time came from to be honest.

He's been the best dad, actually. So I'm pretty, really proud of him, and he has a really special place in my heart.""On the tennis front, there's no comparison between the father and the son.Borg senior, 68 now, lifted Sweden to its maiden Davis Cup win in 1975 when he was just 19. If his 33 singles win streak is a record in the tournament history, his six French Open trophies - four of them in a row - an five straight Wimbledon wins put him altogether in a different plane.Anyone else, in any walk of life, would have walked away from that borrowed stardom and harsh scrutiny that comes with it. Borg the junior has decided to not only play the sport, but also excel in it.Currently ranked 603, Leo had risen to 334 in the ATP charts last year before suffering a loss of form. He has recovered some of his level and motivation with a title and runner-up finish in the dreary ITF circuit in Thailand in recent weeks, jumping 169 places in the ranking ladder.Leo, 21, put it down to a ""simple"" advice he received from his father long ago.""Since I was really young, he said, ‘it's really simple, never stop fighting until the last point'. And that's been a very good advice, just to fight the whole match and the life outside tennis also. That's a really simple thing, but it's been really big.""Amazingly, Leo has not watched videos of his father playing.""I have watched some things, of course, but it's true, I have never searched a video of him or anything like that. Yeah, (it) is funny, I know,"" he smiled.The youngster's humble journey on the tennis court may also explain the current woes of the sport in Sweden. For, Sweden is not just the land of Borg, it is also home to Zlatan.While Leo, who dabbled in football till the age of 12, had no doubts about his commitment to the racquet sport, his compatriots have quickly gravitated to soccer and other more rewarding sports. Not in them the mettle to fight back from losing the fourth set 16-18 in a tiebreaker after having five match points, and go on to win the fifth set in a grand slam final.""In my dad's time, they had a really good amount of tennis players. I think they had some time like five top-10 players. Now, it's completely different. We don't have so many players in Sweden, it's a little bit sad because we are a really good tennis country. I think your mentality is not that good anymore,"" Leo said.""Many Swedish players quit tennis around the age of 18-19 because they think it's too hard to get through pros. Of course, it's hard, you really have to fight through to get to the top. I think out mentality has to be better.""I think we have become too comfort (sic) in our country, to get to the top. So I think we have to focus on the mental side a little bit. Yeah, that's the most important thing, I think, or the difference, from his time.""Tennis is not that big anymore in Sweden, it's not a strange thing, actually, unfortunately.""",Leo Borg is the son of tennis legend Bjorn Borg.

Despite having never defeated Sweden in Davis Cup history, the Indian team is hopeful about securing their first victory in their sixth matchup.The contest will take place on a medium-speed indoor court at the Royal Tennis Hall in Sweden. India usually prefers faster surfaces, which would better suit their big servers.Indoor courts typically feature quick ball travel and are unaffected by external factors like wind.The team will play without top players Sumit Nagal and Yuki Bhambri .Former national champion Siddharth Vishwakarma is under consideration to join the team for an upcoming critical match. Despite his skills, his lack of experience at this level might prevent him from playing in a live rubber.The decision will likely consider his potential and the high-pressure nature of the match. His future participation seems contingent on further growth and experience.Captain Rohit Rajpal may opt for doubles specialist Balaji for the singles as he did against Pakistan on grass court earlier this year. In that match, Balaji performed well by defeating veteran Aqeel Khan in Islamabad and is currently in good form in Stockholm.Ramkumar Ramanathan is set to play a key role on the opening day of the upcoming match. The team's decision on the second singles match is still pending, with the choice between Niki Poonacha and N Sriram Balaji.Poonacha, despite his talent, has uncertain fitness due to a recent ankle sprain during practice. He is more focused on doubles and, although he beat Nagal earlier this year in Pune, has not played or won much in singles recently.Elias Ymer, Sweden's top singles player, is currently ranked 238. Indian player Ramkumar has faced Ymer twice on the ATP Tour, securing victories on both occasions.Ramkumar's performance has consistently shown strong talent and skill, yet the key for him is to stay composed under pressure and trust in his abilities.On Sunday, Balaji is set to play doubles. His partner will be either Ramkumar or Poonacha, which will be decided based on the scores after the first day.""We have better servers, and our players like to get in, play shorter points but these are medium-speed courts, so we are getting used to it by playing a lot of singles with each other,"" Rajpal told PTI.""If Yuki and Sumit were here, the tie would have tilted towards us, now it's 50-50.""""Leo Borg (second singles player) has improved a lot, we are watching him. They have a tough doubles team.""In preparation for the upcoming match, India's newly appointed Davis Cup coach, Ashutosh Singh, has conducted thorough research upon his arrival in Stockholm.In preparation for the upcoming competition, Ashutosh engaged with the coaches of the new team members, including Aryan Shah, to understand the young players' mindset and playing style.The Swedish team, led by Borg, holds the 603rd position in the rankings. Their doubles players, Andre Goransson and Filip Bergevi, are formidable competitors, ranked 66 and 125 respectively.Ashutosh engaged in discussions with players who have previously faced Borg to gather valuable insights. Additionally, Ashutosh dedicated a significant amount of time to analysing videos of the opposing players, which will aid in formulating effective strategies.The draw for the event is set to occur on Friday. The first day will feature singles matches, with doubles and reverse singles scheduled for Sunday.The winner of this tie will advance to the Qualifiers next year, while the losing team will move to the World Group I play-offs.","India will play Sweden in the Davis Cup World Group I contest starting on September 14.

Niki Poonacha fell on the centre court, he sprained his ankle.The physios are working with him, he seems to be doing ok,"" captain Rohit Rajpal said from Stockholm on Wednesday.

to become 1st Italian man to win US Open

He's 6 ft 3' with a scraggy crown, a face that doesn't say much and legs that are defined to cover great ground, run miles and miles at the speed of lightning. Then there is the intangible. An alloy of the unbendable ilk that runs through Jannik Sinner .The scrutiny the top-seed faced coming into the US Open is hard to imagine.

At best it was a divided locker room.So, when Sinner threw up his arms up at the end of a power-packed slugfest with American Taylor Fritz, where he had rallied from 3-5 in the third set, reeling off four straight games to seal a dominant win, he stood tall in the winner's circle that isn't for the weak hearted.

I'm happy how I handled this one.""Sinner, who surrounded himself with a slim-look team in New York, after dropping physio and fitness coach Giacomo Naldi and Umberto Ferrara from his close circle, had his two coaches - Darren Cahill and Simone Vagnozzi - and girlfriend Anna Kalinskaya , ranked 14 on the WTA Tour, to fall back on.""The people who are close to me daily, people who know me already from when I was very young, my family, my team and everyone who supports me,"" Sinner said of the people who stood by him in the hardest times of his young career. ""I always try to stick with them, especially when the moments are getting difficult and tough, because I know that they can help me in these moments.""Sinner, whose title run in New York has taken his record for the year to 55-5, and extended his winning streak to 11 matches, said he's still sometimes weighed down by the incidents of the last five months.""It was and it's still a little bit in my mind,"" he said. ""My team and people who are close to me, they know what I've been through in the last months. It was not only one week before the tournament. It was months.

NEW DELHI: Jannik Sinner ’s 2024 US Open triumph on Sunday marked a major milestone in his tennis career, as he claimed his second Grand Slam title of the year.The 22-year-old Italian defeated Taylor Fritz in a straight-set victory, 6-3, 6-4, 7-5, ending a 21-year wait for an American male champion at the majors.Sinner’s historic win also made him the first Italian man to conquer the US Open, following his Australian Open success earlier in the year.Sinner’s rise in tennis is as unique as it is inspiring. However, before he was known for his powerful forehands and quick reflexes on the court, he was flying down the slopes of the Italian Alps .Growing up in the mountainous South Tyrol region, Sinner was a highly skilled skier, excelling in both slalom and giant slalom.His early years were spent mastering the art of skiing, competing in national junior events, and often securing first place in numerous competitions within his age category, where his balance and precision were key to his success.Skiing also instilled in him a strong mental focus, something that would later become an asset in his tennis career.At the age of 13, Sinner made a pivotal decision—choosing tennis over skiing. He relocated across Italy to train under the guidance of renowned coach Riccardo Piatti , in what proved to be a game-changing move.Piatti quickly recognized Sinner’s proactive, aggressive style, which stood out for someone so young. ""He hit the ball fast, always aiming to win the points,"" Piatti once remarked, noting that Sinner’s fearless mindset was a trait not commonly seen in junior players.Sinner himself credits his skiing background for shaping his mental approach to tennis. Just as in skiing, where each race lasts mere seconds and requires total focus, tennis demanded the same kind of short bursts of concentration.""In both skiing and tennis, he knows when to focus and when to relax,"" Piatti explained, drawing parallels between the two sports that have shaped Sinner’s rise.From being ranked 870th just two years ago to reaching the world number one spot in 2024, Sinner’s ascent has been meteoric. His calm under pressure and relentless drive to improve have made him a formidable force on the court.","Jannik Sinner is the first Italian man to win the US Open. The 22-year-old defeated Taylor Fritz 6-3, 6-4, 7-5 on Sunday. It was Sinner's second Grand Slam title of the year.

CHENNAI: In an all-important Olympic year, HS Prannoy had to battle past struggles to compete in the Paris Games. The seasoned Kerala-born shuttler was ravaged by a spate of setbacks, including a chronic gastrointestinal disorder and a back injury.If that was not enough, just a few weeks before the quadrennial extravaganza, Prannoy was diagnosed with chikungunya.As the 32-year-old Prannoy had to go through a tough phase physically and mentally, he could not give his best in the training.

""I am not looking forward to anything as of now. It has not been a great couple of months. I have to get back to complete fitness and might not be playing a few tournaments. I am not sure when I will make a comeback,"" Prannoy said after the Viktor store opening ceremony here on Tuesday.""I was asking my coaches why I was playing in the Olympics. But to be honest, at that stage, we did what we could. When I look back, I feel good that I played in the Olympics. I wish the injuries, and other setbacks had happened at some other stage of my career.""The Indian badminton contingent returned home without a medal. A lot was expected from the team but they could not live up to the billing.
