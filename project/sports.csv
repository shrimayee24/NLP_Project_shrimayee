India vs Pakistan: Why Suryakumar Yadav-led unit are a worried right now | Asia Cup 2025 final

Poll Was the Super Over one of the most thrilling moments of the Asia Cup for you? Definitely! It was okay Not really

India secured a thrilling Super Over victory against Sri Lanka in their final Super Four match of the Asia Cup in Dubai on Wednesday, with Indian captain Suryakumar Yadav praising his team's character and particularly highlighting the performances of middle-order batsmen Sanju Samson , Tilak Varma, and bowler Arshdeep Singh 's composure in the decisive Super Over where Sri Lanka managed only two runs.The match, despite being a dead rubber, turned into an intense contest with both teams scoring over 200 runs, including a century from Sri Lanka's Pathum Nissanka.""It felt like a final and the boys showed a lot of character after the first half in the second innings. I told the boys to have good energy and let's see where we are at the end. To have that start with the bat, and someone like Sanju and Tilak taking that tempo was good to see. And for someone like Sanju, who is not opening the batting, and taking that responsibility and even Tilak showing great confidence, which was good to see,"" said Suryakumar during the post-match presentation.""Arshdeep has delivered for us the last 2-3 years. I told him to back his own plans and try to execute. He has been there in that situation many times and he has done really well for India and for his IPL side. His confidence says it all.None other than Arshdeep to bowl that Super Over,"" Suryakumar added.The Indian captain mentioned that some players experienced cramps due to heat but assured they would have a recovery day on Saturday before the finals.Sri Lankan captain Charith Asalanka acknowledged Nissanka's impressive century and remained positive despite their winless Super Four stage performance.""It was a fabulous game, and we were in the game until Varun and Kuldeep bowled those middle overs. It was unbelievable batting (from Nissanka), they have some extremely good bowlers and it was splendid to see him bat with that attacking approach. There were many positives from the Asia Cup. We have been playing good cricket, but unfortunately, we could not win in the last two games. As a captain, there are a lot of positives to take,"" Asalanka stated.After winning the toss, Sri Lanka chose to field first. India's innings saw early setbacks with Shubman Gill falling for 4 and captain Suryakumar scoring only 12 runs.Abhishek Sharma continued his outstanding form, scoring 61 off 31 balls with eight fours and two sixes, becoming the first batter to cross 300 runs in the T20I Asia Cup.The middle-order partnership between Tilak Varma (49 not out) and Sanju Samson (39) proved crucial, contributing a 66-run stand and helping India reach 202/5 in their 20 overs.Sri Lanka's chase began poorly with Kusal Mendis dismissed for a golden duck, but Pathum Nissanka and Kusal Perera launched a strong counter-attack.Nissanka scored a brilliant 107 off 58 balls, while Perera contributed 58 runs from 32 balls. Dasun Shanaka added a quick 22 runs, but the match ultimately went to a Super Over with both teams tied.In the bowling department, Kuldeep Yadav was India's most successful bowler with figures of 1/31, while Sri Lanka's Maheesh Theekshana and Wanindu Hasaranga each claimed one wicket.The Super Over saw Arshdeep Singh's exceptional bowling restrict Sri Lanka to just two runs while taking two wickets. India easily chased down the target in just one ball.Nissanka was awarded Player of the Match for his century.

with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three

books

with teachings on virtue, wealth, and

love

and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres.

“I was just talking to her yesterday; how can she be gone today?”

“But this does not look like my doll.”

“My travels have changed me.”

“Everything you love will probably be lost. But in the end, love will return in another way.”

“Irul neengi inbam payakkum marul neengi

Those who see through ignorance to reality find bliss;

Others remain fettered by delusion.

For the young, death feels like smoke drifting somewhere far away; visible but distant. Life is a horizon that stretches endlessly. But as the years pass, the horizon shifts. Just as a stream running atop a hill must eventually surrender itself into a waterfall, the path of life too bends toward its inevitable descent.The first losses often come from a distance—distant relatives, grandparents, elders whose absence seems natural. But the circle keeps tightening. Parents, close relatives, friends; people we meet on an everyday basis begin their journey to the other shore. Some losses feel impossible to accept:As one ages, the news of death becomes strangely more frequent than the news of life. I remember my mother, in her later years, turning to the obituary page of her daily newspaper first. Then, as though offering a silent prayer for the departed—or perhaps breathing a sigh of relief that no familiar name appeared—she would turn to the other pages.Across civilizations, cultures, and religions, humanity has carried with it the idea of—'remember that you will die’. Far from being a grim obsession, this idea is a mirror, showing us what truly matters. Death, in its silent authority, has always been the ultimate purveyor of perspective. It strips away the petty burdens of worry, exposing how trivial most of our concerns are.When someone close departs, the memories arrive like lightning—sudden, sharp, and luminous. Time, the great healer, eventually lays a hand upon the wound. Acceptance grows, but never fully without scars. A familiar song, a forgotten photograph, or a date on the calendar is enough to unearth the pain again. How powerless we stand before the mighty force of Time, who takes away everyone and everything.I am reminded of a story from Franz Kafka’s life. One day he saw a little girl weeping over the loss of her beloved doll in a park. The next day, he handed her a letter ‘from the doll’, explaining that she had gone on a journey and would write of her adventures. Day after day, Kafka met the girl and read out letters full of imagined travels. Months later, he brought her a new doll, saying it had returned from its journeys. The girl protested,Kafka handed her another letter where the doll had written:The child embraced the doll and found peace.Years later, after Kafka’s death, the girl, now an adult, discovered a letter hidden inside the doll. In it, Kafka had written:That is the mystery of loss. People may depart, but the love they poured into us never vanishes. It lingers, takes new shapes, and strengthens us to continue living and passing that love forward. This great continuum—this unbroken chain of love—is perhaps all that life truly is.For those who awaken to this realization, joy and sorrow lose their sharp edges. Life’s ephemeral happenings no longer bind them. Thiruvalluvar expressed this profound vision with unmatched clarity:In the end, grief dissolves into perspective, love returns in other forms, and we learn to flow—like the river—toward the sea of acceptance.","Bharathi Bhaskar explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’ Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124168512,imgsize-61458,width-1000,height-562,resizemode-75/124168512.jpg"

Caitlin Clark misses Dowling Catholic High School Hall of Fame ceremony to stay with Indiana Fever

Indiana Fever reach WNBA semifinals for the first time since 2015 despite injuries to five key players

Caitlin Clark, the leading guard for the Indiana Fever, proved her loyalty to her team by deciding to forgo her induction into the Dowling Catholic High School Athletic Hall of Fame. She wanted to be there for the Fever during their WNBA semifinal playoff game against the Las Vegas Aces. This decision came while the Fever were competing in Game 3 of the best-of-five series, emphasizing Clark's focus on team support rather than individual honors, despite being hampered by injuries for much of the 2025 season.The induction ceremony for the 2025 Athletic Hall of Fame class at Dowling Catholic High School in West Des Moines, Iowa, is set for 6:15 p.m. CT on September 26, 2025, just before the school's homecoming football game.Clark will be recognized along with six other individuals for her outstanding dedication, character, and sportsmanship throughout her high school years.She decided to skip the event and stayed with the Indiana Fever for their Game 3 against the Las Vegas Aces at Gainbridge Fieldhouse in Indianapolis, which started at 7:30 p.m. ET—about 15 minutes after the ceremony considering the time zone changes.In an article about Clark's unwavering support for the team during the playoffs, Chloe Peterson, the Indiana Fever beat reporter for the Indianapolis Star, reported this choice.During the ceremony, Clark's dad, Brent Clark, accepted the award for her, as mentioned in a post by the Dowling Catholic Maroon Crew athletic support group on X, which used to be Twitter. The post celebrated Clark's induction and highlighted her enduring influence on the Maroon community, saying, ""Our Hall of Fame recognizes an elite group of individuals who exemplify the dedication, character, and sportsmanship that define Dowling Catholic.Caitlin’s remarkable journey continues to inspire Maroons everywhere."" The Des Moines Register and Hawk Central have both reported on Clark's absence, mentioning that she's concentrating on helping the Fever in the playoffs.Throughout the season, Clark has been a reliable presence on the Fever's bench, traveling with the team and being at nearly every game since her injury, with the exception of one road trip to Connecticut on August 17, 2025. Her black Nike Air Force 1 sneakers even became a team superstition during the playoffs, aligning with three wins in a row before the streak ended in Game 2 against the Aces.Even with Clark not playing and four other players out for the season, the Indiana Fever made it to the WNBA semifinals for the first time since 2015. In the opening round, the No. 6 seed Fever pulled off an upset against the Atlanta Dream in a best-of-three series, clinching Game 3 with a close score of 87-85 on September 18, 2025.Kelsey Mitchell was the star for the Fever, scoring 24 points, including three three-pointers, marking their first playoff series victory since 2015. The team managed to win two consecutive elimination games against Atlanta to move forward.In the semifinals against the No. 2 seed Las Vegas Aces, the Fever managed to win Game 1 but lost Game 2 with a score of 90-68. The third game, held on September 26, 2025, at Gainbridge Fieldhouse, saw an attendance of 16,507 and resulted in an 84-72 victory for the Aces, giving them a 2-1 lead in the series.Jackie Young was the standout for the Aces, scoring 25 points along with five rebounds and four assists, while NaLyssa Smith added 16 points and four rebounds. A'ja Wilson also had a solid game with 13 points, eight rebounds, four assists, and three blocks, despite a rough shooting night at 6-of-20. Chelsea Gray finished with 15 points and six assists.In the case of the Fever, Kelsey Mitchell led the team with 21, Lexie Hull, 16 and ten with a single-digit number of rebounds each, and Aliyah Boston, 12, eight, and four. The Fever also dominated in offensive rebounds 16-4 but was pressing in the fourth and missed a field goal in nearly nine minutes as the Aces took advantage of the situation. They were publishing in the third quarter with a margin of five points but made serious errors, including free-shots (13-for-21) and close basket shots (8-for-17).The Fever are now also on the verge of being eliminated, as they must win their next two games before getting their way into the WNBA Finals. Despite its challenges, the capacity of the team to rise back to its feet when a crisis hits has been something to be proud of, given the social media post by Clark.Also Read: Dwyane Wade turns Pebble Beach into golf battleground for ACE Cup launch The organization is hopeful that Clark will be fully recovered by the start of the 2026 season, with GM Amber Cox emphasizing the importance of her long-term health.

Robert Saleh sounds alarm on Jaguars’ secret legal signal-stealing system threatening 49ers’ Week 4 game,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/robert-saleh-sounds-alarm-on-jaguars-secret-legal-signal-stealing-system-threatening-49ers-week-4-game/articleshow/124175902.cms,"Robert Saleh (Image credits: IG/X)

Jaguars’ legal signal-stealing system forces opposing defenses to stay fully alert always

Coaching lineage from Sean McVay has influenced Jaguars’ advanced signal recognition techniques

Opposing defenses must adapt quickly or risk falling behind strategically

Jaguars coaching staff chooses focus over public responses to avoid distraction

San Francisco 49ers defensive coordinator Robert Saleh has raised eyebrows ahead of Week 4, highlighting the Jacksonville Jaguars’ clever, legal signal-stealing system that gives them an edge on offense. Saleh praised the Jaguars’ coaching staff, especially offensive coordinator Grant Udinski and head coach Liam Coen, for their ability to read defensive signals. The system is completely within NFL rules but requires defensive teams to stay alert, making matchups mentally challenging and strategic on the field.Saleh recently addressed the media with a mix of admiration and caution, “You know, um, Jacksonville, this is a very young, but it’s a very talented group,” he said. “Liam [Coen] and his staff, a couple of guys coming from Minnesota, they’ve got a—legally—a really advanced signal stealing type system where they always find a way to put themselves in an advantageous situation. They do a great job with it. They formation you to try to find any nugget they can. So we’ve got to be great with our signals and we’ve got to be great with our communication to combat some of the tells that we might give on the field.”Saleh continued to emphasize the broader coaching influence behind the Jaguars’ approach, “They’re almost elite in that regard. That whole entire tree. From Sean [McVay], to Kevin O’Connell, to all those guys, they all do it. So, there’s challenges. They’re gonna catch us in some situations where they have the advantage and we just gotta play good, sound, fundamental football and do our best to execute.”Saleh clarified that the Jaguars’ methods are fully legal under NFL rules, which allow teams to study game footage and observe signals from designated areas. Unauthorized recordings or sideline spying remain illegal, drawing penalties if violated. The Jaguars rely on legal observation and strategic pattern decoding, demonstrating that rule-abiding methods can still provide significant competitive advantages.Saleh explained that defensive teams face constant mental challenges against the Jaguars. Minor hand signals and formation changes can reveal tendencies when read correctly, giving offenses opportunities to exploit matchups. Teams that fail to adapt risk leaving gaps, while those who adjust swiftly maintain competitiveness and neutralize the Jaguars’ edge.Despite Saleh’s remarks, head coach Liam Coen refrained from public comments, focusing on preparation and execution. Analysts note that while the system offers advantages, success depends on disciplined execution, careful communication, and adaptability during games. The Jaguars’ approach showcases how intelligence and preparation can rival physical talent in high-level NFL matchups.Also read: Jaxon Smith-Njigba erupts on hot mic after Seahawks’ nullified touchdown, referee’s disappointed stare sends fans into frenzy","San Francisco 49ers defensive coordinator Robert Saleh has praised the Jacksonville Jaguars’ signal-stealing system.

Adele rumored to decline Super Bowl halftime show, but reports say she’s still in talks

Adele’s complicated history with the Super Bowl halftime stage



“The show is not about music,”

“can’t dance.”

The internet is buzzing with claims that Adele has “officially declined” the NFL ’s offer to headline the 2026 Super Bowl halftime show but the truth is a lot murkier. While some outlets are reporting she’s out, others insist she’s still in talks. The conflicting headlines have left fans confused and speculating about whether the Grammy-winning powerhouse will ever grace the biggest stage in sports.Social media lit up this week after several outlets claimed Adele turned down the halftime gig. The report suggests that the singer rejected the offer and it could be because of security concerns, citing fears about being targeted. These reports quickly went viral, fueling the narrative that Adele had walked away from the deal before it was finalized.But not everyone is convinced she’s out. Multiple sources report that Adele is still very much in discussions with the NFL and Roc Nation, which co-produces the halftime show. According to these outlets, talks are ongoing, and nothing has been officially confirmed. For now, it seems Adele’s status remains firmly in the “to be determined” category.This isn’t the first time Adele’s name has been tied to the Super Bowl.Back in 2016, she revealed that she was approached to perform but turned it down, saying she didn’t think the high-energy halftime format suited her style.she said at the time, adding that sheThat refusal is one reason fans are quick to believe fresh rumors about her walking away from the 2026 slot.For football fans and Swifties alike, the 2026 halftime show has been a hot topic. Rumors of Taylor Swift headlining had dominated the conversation earlier this year, only for Adele’s name to surface as the new frontrunner. With Adele now rumored to have declined, speculation is only intensifying about who will eventually take the stage at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara.Right now, Adele’s Super Bowl status is a mystery. While some outlets say she’s turned it down, others maintain she’s still negotiating. Until either Adele or the NFL makes an official statement, the only certainty is uncertainty. For now, fans will have to wait to see whether the global superstar decides to say yes to the world’s biggest halftime show or pass once again.Also read - Shane Tamura, the man who killed 4 at NFL headquarters, blamed the NFL in his suicide note — now medical examiners confirm he had CTE","Adele is rumored to have turned down the NFL's offer to headline the 2026 Super Bowl halftime show.

The Super Over Controversy

Sri Lanka head coach Sanath Jayasuriya praised Abhishek Sharma and Pathum Nissanka , while questioning the ""grey areas"" in cricket after a controversial Super Over incident in the last Super Four match of the Asia Cup.""Abhishek Sharma is playing his natural game, and they have encouraged him to play his natural game. That's the key, because if someone is playing naturally, we need to encourage him to continue that,"" Jayasuriya told reporters after the match.""But whenever he wants to slow down, he knows how to do that as well. After six overs, if he wants to bat longer, he’s managing it. Day by day, he’s getting experience and batting really well. The good thing is that the coaching staff has given him the license to play his natural game. That's the key,"" he added.Abhishek scored a blazing 61, almost cancelled out by Pathum Nissanka, whose 107 off 58 balls brought Sri Lanka close to victory.""I think Pathum played a brilliant innings to get that total, but unfortunately, he got out on the first ball of the last over. That was a bit unfortunate. But right through those 20 overs, he batted really well to get 100 and put 202 runs on the board.Unfortunately, his dismissal in the last over proved to be the turning point,"" he said.Jayasuriya also explained why centurion Pathum Nissanka didn’t bat in the Super Over.""He was carrying a hamstring injury during the last two games and we were a little worried about him,"" he revealed.In the Super Over, drama unfolded with a bizarre incident. Arshdeep Singh struck on the first ball, dismissing Kusal Perera . On the fourth delivery, Dasun Shanaka missed, and Sanju Samson pouched it cleanly as Arshdeep appealed for caught behind. The umpire raised his finger despite no edge, even as Samson threw down the stumps for a run-out. Sri Lanka argued the ball was dead once the caught-behind decision was given, and the umpire agreed, overturning the run-out. It mattered little, as Shanaka fell on the very next ball.""I think that’s just the rules. According to the rules, if you appeal for the catch, then Dasun had to go by the third umpire’s call. The first decision always counts, not the second one. So he went for the replay, and it was not out. That’s what happened. But I think there are a few areas from this game that will need review to fine-tune the rules,"" Jayasuriya said.Here’s what rule 20.1.1.3 of the rule book says: “The ball is dead when a batter is dismissed. The ball will be deemed to be dead from the instant of the incident causing the dismissal.”This meant that despite the batter being clearly run out, the ball was deemed dead the moment Sanju completed the catch and the umpire gave it out.","Sri Lanka coach Sanath Jayasuriya praises Abhishek Sharma and Pathum Nissanka.

India enter another final but continue to be sloppy in the field | Concerns ahead of title clash

Team India’s bowling coach Morne Morkel has shared an injury update on all-rounder Hardik Pandya and opener Abhishek Sharma ahead of their summit clash against Pakistan at the Dubai International Stadium on Sunday.Hardik, who bowled the first over of Sri Lanka’s innings and picked up a wicket, left the field and never returned. Meanwhile, Abhishek, who smashed a blazing 31-ball 61 with the bat, left the ground in the 9.2 over.“Both of them struggled with cramps during the game,” Morkel told reporters.“Hardik will be assessed tonight and tomorrow morning, and we’ll make a call on that. But both of them were just struggling with cramps during the game. Abhishek is fine,” he said.In a match that swung both ways, India held their nerve in the Super Over to stay unbeaten in the tournament.Morkel felt it was a good wake-up call for the team, as they have not been clinical so far.“I don’t think in this tournament we’ve played the complete game,” he admitted.“After every game there are discussions on areas we’d like to improve. With batting, can we rotate strike better in tough conditions, run harder between the wickets, and protect partnerships? From a bowling perspective, we need to sharpen our lengths, accuracy and decision-making in the first 10 overs, and be smarter in using variations like the yorker during the middle phase.“In the field, we’ve worked hard on catching under lights, so maybe it’s just a confidence issue. Across departments, there’s still work to be done. We are by no means the finished article, and we know that.”Morkel also revealed that after a gruelling match, the team will have an off day before the final, with only individual pool sessions and recovery work.“The key for the boys is to rest,” he said. “They’re already in ice baths, and recovery started right after the match. The best way to recover is sleep and staying off your feet. There will be pool sessions and massages before they get mentally ready for Sunday’s big battle. It’s a quick turnaround, and playing smart is going to be the key. There will certainly be no training.”",Hardik Pandya and Abhishek Sharma struggled with cramps during the match. Both players left the field in the 9.2th over of Sri Lanka's innings. Morne Morkel said the match was a good wake-up call for the team.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124173439,imgsize-1357172,width-400,resizemode-4/abhishek-sharma-and-hardik-pandya.jpg"

India enter another final but continue to be sloppy in the field | Concerns ahead of title clash

Poll Who do you believe holds the responsibility for the recent on-field drama? Indian players Pakistan players Both teams equally

Former India pacer Yograj Singh issued a sharp warning amid the row that erupted during the Asia Cup Super Fours clash between India and Pakistan, after heated exchanges on the field involving Haris Rauf, Shaheen Afridi and Sahibzada Farhan.The on-field spat began when Pakistan pacers appeared to target India’s young openers Abhishek Sharma and Shubman Gill with verbal attacks. The Indian batters responded on the field, and the back and forth has since provoked strong reactions off it.Yograj Singh spoke out forcefully, making clear where his loyalties stood. “I will always be with my country. I am a citizen of my country. If anyone speaks against my country, I will not tolerate it... But, as far as the players are concerned, they should be respected. If your country doesn't respect us, how will the outsiders respect us?” he told ANI.The 67-year-old also used threatening language, making his feelings clear.Yograj said the incident crossed a line and defended the Indian youngsters, arguing they had not provoked the confrontation. He pointed the finger at the Pakistan pacers and questioned why the abuse began in the first place.“Both the players were playing. They were not saying anything to anyone. So, the players (Shaheen Afridi and Haris Rauf) went and started abusing them. Neither Abhishek said anything, nor Shubhman. Then what is the point of this? This is not frustration; what is it?” Yograj said.The remarks add fuel to an already charged rivalry ahead of the Asia Cup final between India and Pakistan on Sunday. Emotions have run high during the tournament, and the latest incidents have drawn criticism and attention from former players and fans alike.Yograj’s comments show just how closely the on-field encounters are criticised, and how quickly verbal attacks and sledging can escalate into bigger controversies. His defence of the Indian batters and his fierce threat has already become a talking point on social media and.With the final a day away, it is difficult to rule out more verbal attacks, provocative gestures and tempers flaring as both teams will look to give it their all and secure the Asia Cup 2025 trophy. However, India, like in the Super Fours clash, will look to do their talking on the pitch and let the cricket do the talking.","Former India pacer Yograj Singh issued a sharp warning amid the row that erupted during the Asia Cup Super Fours clash between India and Pakistan.

Why was Dasun Shanaka given not out even after getting 'out'?

Arshdeep Singh bowled to Shanaka, India appealed for a caught-behind, and the on-field umpire gave him out.

Shanaka reviewed, and UltraEdge showed no bat-ball contact, overturning the caught-behind dismissal.

During the review, Shanaka ran for a single, and Samson hit the stumps with a direct throw.

The ball was dead once the umpire initially gave Shanaka out, so he could not be run out.

As a result, Shanaka remained not out, saved by the technicality in the laws of cricket.

In a dramatic Asia Cup 2025 clash between India and Sri Lanka that went down to a Super Over on Friday, one moment left fans and even players scratching their heads: Dasun Shanaka being given ""not out"" despite what seemed like a dismissal.During Sri Lanka’s Super Over after they amassed an exact 202/5 to tie the score, Arshdeep Singh bowled a near-perfect yorker to Shanaka on his fourth delivery.The ball whizzed past the bat, prompting an immediate appeal from Arshdeep and wicketkeeper Sanju Samson. Umpire Gazi Sohel raised his finger for caught behind.Shanaka, however, decided to review.Now, here’s where things got confusing.Even as the caught-behind appeal was being processed, Shanaka inexplicably set off for a run.Wicketkeeper Sanju Samson, quick to notice, threw down the stumps with a direct hit.India celebrated, believing Shanaka was gone either way.However, since the initial decision had already been given as “out caught behind”, the ball was considered dead at that very moment.That meant Shanaka could not also be run out in the same sequence of play.When the review overturned the caught-behind dismissal, Shanaka survived completely despite being short of his ground.The ruling might appear confusing, but it’s rooted in the MCC laws of cricket: once a batter is declared out, the ball is dead instantly. Even if that dismissal is later overturned via DRS, no subsequent mode of dismissal from that same delivery can apply.India’s fielders were visibly perplexed, with umpire Sohel taking time to explain the law. Shanaka, for his part, was fortunate.Ultimately, Sri Lanka managed just two runs in the Super Over, leaving India to chase a modest target which they did with ease.The incident will likely spark further debate on whether the rules need tweaking for scenarios involving DRS, but as of now, Shanaka was saved by nothing more than a technicality.","Sri Lanka's Dasun Shanaka given 'not out' despite what seemed like a dismissal.

CeeDee Lamb ’s setback leaves Cowboys searching for answers on offense

Packers return to full strength as Cowboys brace for challenges

The Dallas Cowboys are approaching a critical moment in their season as the team weighs whether to place wide receiver CeeDee Lamb on injured reserve following a high-ankle sprain. With a primetime matchup against the Green Bay Packers on Sunday night, the decision could reshape both Dallas’ short-term offensive firepower and its broader playoff hopes.CeeDee Lamb suffered the injury in Week 3 against the Chicago Bears, when linebacker Noah Sewell rolled across his left ankle during a first-quarter play. The receiver limped off the field and never returned, with tests later confirming a high-ankle sprain. ESPN’s Todd Archer reported the recovery timeline could stretch to three or four weeks, leaving Dallas in a difficult position.Executive vice president Stephen Jones shed light on the team’s cautious approach during an interview on 105.3 The Fan. “We’ll see how both players are next week before making a decision about putting them on injured reserve,” Jones said, referring to Lamb and rookie guard Tyler Booker, who is also sidelined with the same injury.Placement on IR would rule them out for at least four more games.While the loss of Lamb is significant—he has been Dak Prescott’s go-to target—the Cowboys will take some comfort in knowing cornerbacks Trevon Diggs and DaRon Bland are available, keeping their secondary intact against Green Bay.Adding to Dallas’ difficulties, the Packers are regaining key starters just in time for the Week 4 showdown. Running back Josh Jacobs, who battled an ankle issue, is officially cleared to play after being limited in practice. Quarterback Jordan Love, who had been nursing a thumb injury, has also been a full participant and is set to start.That means the Cowboys’ injury-depleted offense will face a Green Bay squad trending in the opposite direction, getting stronger ahead of the AT&T Stadium clash. The game also marks Micah Parsons’ return to Dallas following his dramatic trade and rift with owner Jerry Jones, giving Sunday night’s matchup added emotional weight.Also Read: Andy Reid confident in Xavier Worthy’s Week 4 comeback as Chiefs face tough decision on injury risk For Dallas, the immediate question is whether Lamb’s recovery will be prioritized for the long haul or rushed back to salvage a crucial stretch of games.

Florida State gets healthier but still faces uncertainty with game-time calls



Seminoles enter red-hot with record-breaking offensive pace



As Florida State gears up for its ACC opener against the Virginia Cavaliers, the Seminoles released an updated injury report that could impact how both teams approach Friday night’s primetime showdown in Charlottesville. With kickoff set for 7 p.m. ET on ESPN, FSU will look to build on its explosive start to the season while navigating some key lineup questions.The Seminoles received good news ahead of the matchup as quarterback Tommy Castellanos, tight end Randy Pittman Jr., running back Caziah Holmes, and offensive lineman Jonathan Daniels were all cleared after initially being listed as probable earlier in the week. Their availability gives head coach Mike Norvell a boost as FSU enters its toughest test to date.However, not all updates were positive. Wide receiver Jayvan Boggs, linebacker Caleb LaVallee, and defensive lineman Kevin Wynn were downgraded to game-time decisions, leaving questions about depth and rotation on both sides of the ball. Running backs Kam Davis and Roydell Williams, along with several defensive players, remain out.Virginia, meanwhile, designated offensive lineman Ethan Sipe as a game-time decision, while announcing a lengthy list of absences, including cornerbacks Dre Walker and Jam Jackson, which could test their secondary against FSU’s high-powered passing attack.The injury report comes as Florida State is making national headlines for its offensive dominance. The Seminoles are averaging a staggering 58 points per game and have already set program records for total yards and rushing output in consecutive weeks. They became the first ACC program in history to post back-to-back 725-yard games, and they currently lead the nation in scoring margin at +48 points per contest.Against Virginia, the challenge will be sustaining that pace on the road while managing any late roster shake-ups. Stephen Jones of the Cowboys recently said about a similar situation in the NFL, “We’ll see how both players are next week before making a decision,” and that same cautious approach seems to apply for college football coaches managing high-stakes injuries.Also Read: Andy Reid confident in Xavier Worthy’s Week 4 comeback as Chiefs face tough decision on injury risk With Virginia coming off a dominant 48-20 win over Stanford, the Cavaliers are poised to test FSU’s depth.

Chiefs eager for Xavier Worthy’s spark as offense struggles with depth

Andy Reid urges patience but knows Ravens matchup raises stakes

Kansas City Chiefs head coach Andy Reid has confirmed that rookie wide receiver Xavier Worthy remains on track to suit up in Week 4 against the Baltimore Ravens, despite ongoing questions about his shoulder injury. Reid’s comments highlight the balancing act between protecting a young star and reigniting an offense that has lacked its full arsenal.Xavier Worthy has not played since dislocating his right shoulder in the season opener in Brazil after an unfortunate collision with Travis Kelce . The setback came at a time when the Chiefs were already short-handed, with Rashee Rice serving a six-game suspension.Reid emphasized optimism while addressing his receiver’s recovery. “He’s been able to keep himself in good shape,” Reid said, adding that Worthy has worked hard throughout his rehab. The rookie participated fully in practice on Wednesday, a promising sign for both Reid and Patrick Mahomes, who have been adjusting to a rotating cast of receivers.Without Worthy, Kansas City’s offense has leaned heavily on Marquise “Hollywood” Brown and JuJu Smith-Schuster, while rookie Tyquan Thornton has made the most of his opportunities.Still, Worthy’s speed and versatility bring an element no other player can replicate. Last season, he showcased his playmaking ability with 59 receptions, 638 yards, and six touchdowns, plus three rushing scores.The Chiefs were cautious last week, holding Worthy out against the Giants even though he lobbied to return. “He was real positive coming in, and he was mentally. He was saying I’m going to play in the game and you kind of have to take that approach with that type of an injury, and he did,” Reid explained. “He came out and practiced and did the best that he could. But it just wasn’t right.”Also Read: Chiefs heiress Gracie Hunt turns heads in $1,629 Dolce & Gabbana dress during NYC date night with Derek Green With the Ravens’ physical secondary looming, Worthy’s return could either be the jolt Kansas City needs or a risky gamble if his shoulder is not fully stable.

Chris Kluwe mocks Charlie Kirk’s assassination

A pattern of reckless activism threatens to overshadow his campaign

Former Minnesota Vikings punter Chris Kluwe has always carried the label of an outspoken activist, but his latest remarks may have pushed him past the point of no return. Following the shocking assassination of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk during a Utah college event, Kluwe took to Blue Sky with an outburst that has drawn both fierce backlash and surprising support.Within hours of the news breaking, Chirs Kluwe posted, “F*ck. Charlie. Kirk. I’m tired of coddling Nazis.” He followed that with memes mocking Kirk’s death, including one that read, “ ‘Hahaha yes! This rules!’ ‘what the f-ck’ ”. The tone was less about grief and more about ridicule, which left many questioning his sense of judgment.Critics argue that what could have been dismissed as dark humor instead appeared as open celebration of political violence. The reaction has been swift. While conservatives naturally condemned Kluwe’s words, even Democrats in his home district voiced dismay. One Orange County voter told The Blast, “That kind of rhetoric, especially with what seems to be a gleeful attitude, is disgusting. There’s no place for that in politics. ”Kluwe’s controversial behavior didn’t start with this latest tirade. Earlier this year, he was arrested at a Huntington Beach City Council meeting after shouting, “MAGA is a Nazi movement,” and refusing to leave.He also lost a coaching job over the incident, a firing he later challenged in court. His social media history is littered with provocative calls to action, including urging Dodgers fans to throw trash on the field and encouraging disruptive tactics against federal authorities.Despite this track record, Kluwe is currently running for California’s 72nd Assembly District and has reportedly raised nearly $100,000. Instead of derailing his campaign, the firestorm seems to be driving donations, with his supporters framing him as a truth-teller unafraid to confront extremism.But the strategy is a risky one. Every outburst gives him headlines, yet it risks alienating moderate voters. As one Democrat put it bluntly after reading his posts: “Honestly, it’s a little scary.”Also Read: “Dumbest sh*t”: Antonio Brown ridicules proposed Charlie Kirk coin legislation while demanding Epstein files be released Whether Kluwe’s brash approach cements his role as a fearless political outsider or ends his career before it begins, one thing is clear: his tirades about Charlie Kirk’s death will cast a long shadow over his run for office.","Former Minnesota Vikings punter Chris Kluwe mocks Charlie Kirk's death on social media.

While McDavid remains under contract through 2025–26, the team’s top priority is locking him into a long-term extension. But recent reports suggest the superstar has little urgency to sign before puck drop, leaving Edmonton’s front office unsettled.Insider Frank Seravalli told the FAN Pregame Show, “Once you get past opening day, what’s the next impetus to sign? Once that slides by, if he is unsigned, I could for sure see this going all the way to June.” For a franchise built entirely around its captain, the possibility of McDavid playing out his contract year introduces significant risk.Known for his low-profile approach off the ice, McDavid rarely makes public statements about his plans. That discretion, while part of his personality, has left fans and analysts speculating even more. Edmonton knows that without clarity, the noise will only grow louder.Edmonton head coach Kris Knoblauch and team executives are reportedly in ongoing meetings with McDavid’s camp, trying to accelerate the process.Seravalli emphasized to Bleacher Report Open Ice that “these next two weeks until puckdrop are going to be incredibly significant for the Oilers.”For the organization, the stakes couldn’t be higher. The Oilers’ roster is carefully balanced around McDavid and Leon Draisaitl, but every passing day without a signed extension increases the risk of distraction. A contract year for McDavid doesn’t hurt his value — if anything, it strengthens his negotiating power. But for Edmonton, the nightmare scenario would be showcasing their superstar to the rest of the league without a long-term deal in place.Also Read: NHL sets December 1 return date for players acquitted in Hockey Canada sexual assault trial The Oilers’ strategy now is clear: make their strongest push before the season begins. Yet with McDavid holding all the leverage, Edmonton is bracing for the possibility that this saga may drag well into 2026.","Connor McDavid's contract extension talks are not progressing smoothly. This raises concerns for the team's future. The Oilers are under pressure to secure a deal before the season starts. For a franchise built entirely around its captain, the possibility of McDavid playing out his contract year introduces significant risk.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124157957,imgsize-49736,width-400,resizemode-4/124157957.jpg"

Brandon Clarke sidelined again as Grizzlies frontcourt faces major injury setbacks

Brandon Clarke’s absence adds to Memphis Grizzlies ’ injury problems ahead of 2025–26 season

Just before the 2025–26 season began, the Memphis Grizzlies ' tragic fate took yet another toll. According to an ESPN story, Brandon Clarke, a forward/center for the Grizzlies, will have an arthroscopic treatment to treat knee synovitis and will be assessed again in six weeks. Shams Charania, an NBA expert for ESPN, made the initial announcement. Even though his return date hasn’t been confirmed yet, it is anticipated that he will fully recover soon.After missing the rest of the season due to a high-grade right PCL sprain he suffered on March 19, the Grizzlies announced Friday that Clarke was fully recovered . However, he was hurt once more.Announcing the news, Shams Charania wrote:“Memphis Grizzlies F/C Brandon Clarke will undergo a procedure to address knee synovitis and is expected to be re-evaluated in 6 weeks, sources tell ESPN. Clarke missed tail end of the 2024-25 season with a PCL sprain, which has fully healed. He's expected to make a full recovery…”This is a major setback for Memphis, who will already be without Zach Edey for a few months, and Jaren Jackson Jr., who was just extended, is probably going to miss the start of the season.Additionally, Keith Smith of the NBA wrote on X:“Grizzlies frontcourt is starting to look awfully thin. No Zach Edey and no Brandon Clarke to start the season. Jaren Jackson Jr. is coming off offseason surgery. Lots of minutes for Santi Aldama and Jock Landale to open the year. Maybe some for two-way player PJ Hall too…”Over the last three years, Clarke has had a growing number of issues. He was out for the rest of that season and nearly all of the 2023–24 season after suffering a torn left Achilles tendon in March of 2023.The Grizzlies further declared that two-time Centre Zach Edey will be out six to nine more weeks while he recovers from surgery on his left ankle, and All-Star Jaren Jackson Jr. is anticipated to be out four to six more weeks due to a toe problem. Jackson Jr. should be back to play in another month and a half, and Cedric Coward will be back from injury soon.In 64 games last season, Clarke averaged 8.3 points and 5.1 rebounds on 62.1 percent shooting from the floor. In six seasons with Memphis, he has averaged 10.2 points, 5.5 rebounds, 1.3 assists, and 20.8 minutes in 307 regular season games.The loss of Clarke is another defeat for the team. Clarke's physical style of play, quickness, and efficiency close to the basket are vital for Memphis regardless of whether Zach Edey and Jaren Jackson Jr. are on the court. It now has a new coach , draft pick, and overhauled roster.The Grizzlies' success in the physical Western Conference would lie in Clarke, Jackson Jr., Edey, and Coward, but Memphis could start slowly because of the serious injuries.Also read: Ace Bailey steals the show as Utah Jazz dominates Memphis Grizzlies in summer league thriller","Brandon Clarke sidelined again as Grizzlies frontcourt faces major injury setbacks.

Joe Burrow’s heartfelt message leaves fans emotional

Bengals’ playoff hopes now rest on survival mode

Injury history adds to the weight of this moment

Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow has once again found himself battling through adversity, and this time it comes in the form of a left toe injury that required surgery. The 27-year-old, who has been the face of the Bengals’ resurgence in recent years, broke his silence with an emotional Instagram post that left fans both concerned and hopeful.Just one week removed from surgery, Joe Burrow posted photos of himself alongside a short but powerful caption: “This game will break your heart. See you soon.”The message resonated deeply with Bengals fans, many of whom are still processing the possibility that Burrow could miss the remainder of the 2025 season. While the words reflected the harsh reality of professional football, they also hinted at Burrow’s determination to return. His resilience has been tested before, and each time, he’s fought his way back to the field.The Bengals currently sit at 2-1, a respectable position but one that could quickly unravel without their franchise quarterback. Backup Jake Browning is expected to step into the starting role, but the team’s recent blowout loss to the Minnesota Vikings exposed the uphill climb ahead.For Cincinnati to keep playoff hopes alive, the offense must find ways to adapt without the precision and leadership Burrow brings.The defense will also need to step up, buying time until there’s even a slim chance of Burrow’s return in late December.This setback is especially gut-wrenching considering Burrow’s injury history. He lost his rookie season in 2020 to an ACL tear and suffered a season-ending wrist injury in 2023. Each time, the Bengals’ momentum took a major hit, and this latest blow has fans wondering how much more their quarterback can endure.Also Read: Dallas Cowboys face tough call on CeeDee Lamb’s ankle injury before Week 4 matchup with Packers Still, Burrow’s message suggests he isn’t giving up, and neither are his teammates or the city that has rallied behind him.

Cleveland Browns insider predicts Shedeur Sanders trade

Shedeur Sanders, the Cleveland Browns' rookie quarterback, is navigating the complexities of his first NFL season. Drafted in the fifth round of the 2025 NFL Draft, he's also dealing with high expectations, particularly from his Hall of Fame father, Deion Sanders.On the ""New Heights"" podcast, Deion Sanders confidently stated that his son would eventually get a shot at the Browns' starting role, perhaps sooner than people think, especially with veteran Joe Flacco's struggles. Shedeur is currently behind fellow rookie Dillon Gabriel on the depth chart, making the team's quarterback situation uncertain.When reporters asked Shedeur about his father's remarks on Thursday, he offered a thoughtful and composed response. He made it clear that he isn't letting outside speculation affect his approach. He told reporters that his mindset is dictated by daily preparation, not by his current standing on the depth chart.""I focus on each and every day, what I got to do,"" Sanders said, emphasizing his commitment to his craft. He acknowledged the unpredictable nature of the NFL, stating that he is ""just staying locked in...and remaining focused on the main thing.""The Cleveland Browns started the 2025 season with a quarterback depth chart. It included veterans Joe Flacco and Kenny Pickett, along with rookies Dillon Gabriel and Shedeur Sanders. After Pickett was traded to the Raiders, Flacco was named the starter. However, with Flacco's performance facing scrutiny, many believe the team might soon turn to Gabriel.This situation leaves Sanders as the third-string quarterback, with many, feeling he has the potential to lead. Yet, his path to a starting role seems blocked in Cleveland. In a bold prediction, ESPN Cleveland's Tony Rizzo suggested that the Browns might trade Sanders before the November deadline. He believes the rookie's high profile and potential make him a valuable asset. Rizzo speculated that the Browns could get a fourth or fifth-round pick in return, a feasible idea given Sanders' immense popularity and upside.A quarterback-needy team, like the New York Jets, New Orleans Saints, or Tennessee Titans, could be a potential suitor. A trade would not only benefit the Browns by securing a future draft pick but could also be welcomed by Sanders, as it might elevate him to a backup role and a better chance to see the field.Also read: Deion Sanders reveals why Shedeur refused to ride the bench behind Lamar Jackson in Baltimore

Los Angeles Lakers could vie for Utah Jazz's Walker Kessler again amid uncertainty about LeBron James' future,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/los-angeles-lakers-could-vie-for-utah-jazzs-walker-kessler-again-amid-uncertainty-about-lebron-james-future/articleshow/124166191.cms,"Walker Kessler (Image via X)

Walker Kessler gains the attention of Los Angeles Lakers, again!



Are Utah Jazz ready to part ways with Walker Kessler?

Walker Kessler, the 7'1"" center from Utah Jazz is nearing free agency, and seems like the Los Angeles Lakers are interested in bringing him in. After the departure of Anthony Davis back in February of this year, which saw Luka Doncic joining the team, their position for a defensive big in the team felt lacking. And that is exactly what the Lakers could be looking to fill with someone like Kessler.Walker Kessler was the choice of Minnesota Timberwolves with the 22nd overall pick in the 2022 NBA Draft, before getting traded to the Utah Jazz. After three years with the team, he has one more left of his rookie contract, and is set to become a restricted free agent for the Jazz next summer. Which gives the Los Angeles Lakers the opportunity to try and bring him into the fold, especially with all the uncertainty surrounding LeBron James ' place in the future of the team. According to ESPN's Dave McMenamin,""Kessler was one of the centers L.A. inquired about last season before the Williams trade, sources told ESPN, but Utah's asking price—multiple first-round picks—was too steep.""LeBron James is set to go into restricted free agency next summer for the Lakers, and so far, he has not been offered an extension on his contract. Though General Manager Rob Pelinka and head coach JJ Redick want him to end his career with the Lakers, Pelinka was also heard saying that he would respect James in whatever decision he makes regarding his future. With so much uncertainty about his place in the team after the upcoming season, it's not a surprise that they are looking to add more depth to their roster with someone like Kessler.While the Utah Jazz have said previously that they see Walker Kessler as a cornerstone of their future, they have not yet offered him any contract extension. And given he is proving himself to be one of the top defenders in the league, it's no surprise that the Lakers are inquiring about him. If LeBron James decides to leave, the Lakers could become one of the major players in 2026 free agency, and use the Jazz's lack of control over Kessler as a way to lure him into a deal with the team. As reported by Lakers Daily,“A league source told Lakers Daily that the Lakers will attempt to trade for Kessler again during the 2025-26 season. LAL tried to trade for Kessler the past two seasons.”Given their interest in the 24-year-old for the last two years, and Kessler's gradual improvement in his position, he could be a top candidate to partner up alongside Luka Doncic. Doncic is currently the center of the Lakers, around whom they are shaping the future of the team, and Kessler could very well become a long-term part of that.Also Read: What is Walker Kessler's net worth?
