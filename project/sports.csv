Bangladesh seek T20 WC match shift from India after Mustafizur Rahman's IPL exit

The Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) on Friday offered its first response to the ongoing controversy surrounding Bangladesh’s request to play its T20 World Cup matches outside India. The BCCI top brass reviewed operations at its Centre of Excellence (CoE) in Bengaluru and also discussed plans to streamline India U-19 and India A tours going forward, board secretary Devajit Saikia told PTI.Following the meeting, Saikia was asked about Bangladesh approaching the International Cricket Council (ICC) to seek a shift of its T20 World Cup games out of India after the BCCI instructed IPL franchise Kolkata Knight Riders to release Mustafizur Rahman from its roster amid the prevailing relations between the two countries.Saikia responded: ""The meeting was about CoE and other cricketing matters. It's not our domain to talk about that (as the ICC has the final say on Bangladesh's participation in the T20 World Cup).""The meeting, held in Mumbai, was also attended by BCCI president Mithun Manhas, vice-president Rajeev Shukla and head of cricket at the CoE VVS Laxman. Several key technical positions at the CoE, which became fully operational in April last year, remain vacant, including the roles of head of education and head of sports science.""We assessed the vacancies at CoE and decided to go ahead with the recruitment process soon. There is an acute shortage of technical personnel worldwide, but we are trying to fill the positions at the earliest,"" Saikia said.Reviewing the operations at the CoE and outlining the way forward, Saikia added: ""We thought it was an appropriate time to review the preparations and activities of CoE.""We are hosting matches on the three grounds there (including the ongoing Vijay Hazare Trophy). We also talked about how the A tours need to be scheduled going forward.""In certain situations, the A side and senior team are touring together at the same time. We need to ensure that there is no overlap. An A tour is an important supply line of cricketers,"" said the cricketer-turned-lawyer from Assam.",Bangladesh seek T20 WC match shift from India after Mustafizur Rahman's IPL exit.

Supreme Court Directs Dogs Be Shifted From Schools, Bus Stands To Shelters; Petitioner Breaks Down

Stray dogs: NGO asks SC to involve experts

NEW DELHI: As animal rights activists submitted that stray dogs need not be removed from premises of public institutions like hospitals and colleges as they are not a threat to humans and that both can live peacefully, Supreme Court on Friday said the picture projected by them in favour of the canines is different from ground realities.Seeking rollback of SC's order to make these premises free of strays, a lawyer told a bench of Justices Vikram Nath, Sandeep Mehta and N V Anjaria that recently a picture showing a dog walking along with monks across the US went viral while, in another recent case, a dog came to the rescue of a toddler.The bench, however, said cases of dog bites give a different picture. ""We will tell you the reality at the end of the arguments,"" the bench said.Senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, appearing for NGO 'All Creatures Great and Small', urged the court to involve domain experts, as was done in the Aravali case.The obligation of the court to enforce rights is in the absence of legislation. The court will be building a new edifice if you enter into that territory,"" Singhvi told the bench.""While our amicus is great, the concept of amici are basically law advisers.They are not domain experts. The court must have domain experts along with the amicus. In the recent Aravali judgment, the reconsideration was because that committee had 90% bureaucrats - generalists, not domain experts. Reconsideration was done because the domain experts had to come in. It will improve the quality of court orders,"" Singhvi said.SC has said it would give a hearing to whoever files an application in the matter. Over the past three days, the hearing has spanned for six-and-half-hours and the court has heard the views of 20 individuals and NGOs. It will resume on Tuesday.","Supreme Court on Friday said the picture projected by them in favour of the canines is different from ground realities.

BJP Targets Mamata Banerjee Over ED Raid At I-PAC, Alleges Evidence Tampering

KOLKATA: A day after a tense standoff with an ED team during its raid at I-PAC office in Kolkata on Thursday, West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee lodged on Friday two FIRs against ""unidentified"" ED officials for ""theft, criminal trespass, criminal intimidation and tampering with electronic data"" and led a 6km-long protest march in Kolkata, ending it with a speech and thundering that ""an injured tiger is more dangerous than a healthy one"".By all accounts, it's the first time that a chief minister has lodged FIRs against a central probe agency, at least unheard of in West Bengal that is currently headed for assembly elections.While addressing a rally at the end of the two-hour march from Jadavpur to Hazra crossing, Banerjee said, ""What I did was in the capacity of TMC chairperson. I did nothing wrong. If you come to kill me, I have every right to defend myself. Why did you come like a thief? You came to steal information.""Banerjee emailed a complaint against ED to Shakespeare Sarani police station on Thursday night, which led to registration of the first FIR on Friday. The FIR was drawn up under BNS sections 303, 332 and 3(5), along with section 66 of IT Act. The CM's second FIR was lodged with Electronic Complex police station in Salt Lake Sector V.The CM is said to have drafted both complaints while sitting outside I-PAC office at Godrej Waterside building in Sector V on Thursday.She had stationed herself there for four hours while ED sleuths were searching the office.Meanwhile, ending the march at Hazra crossing, the CM said that I-PAC had once worked with BJP too, adding, ""They (I-PAC) have worked for Chandrababu Naidu, Jagan Reddy and Nitish Kumar too. They (BJP) have so many, yet they have declared a war (against us).""Warning her detractors, the CM said an injured tiger is more dangerous than a healthy one. ""They awakened me through this attack. I feel rejuvenated after yesterday's incident,"" she said.Banerjee alleged that Union minister Amit Shah and Bengal BJP functionary Suvendu Adhikari have links with the coal scam, which triggered Thursday's searches. ""They talk about coal money, but who took it? It went to Amit Shah through the traitor. He has become Shah's adopted son. Along with him is BJP's Jagannath. The money reaches Suvendu Adhikari via Jagannath and then goes to Shah through Adhikari... You are lucky I have not released any pen drives yet. If you cross limits, I will expose you. I maintain courtesy up to a point, but there is a limit. I know many things, but I keep silent for the sake of the country.

Shashi Tharoor Praises Nehru’s Democracy Role, Admits 1962 Errors, Accuses BJP Of Blame Politics

NEW DELHI: Senior Congress leader and MP Shashi Tharoor on Thursday once again appeared to strike a balanced tone. While expressing respect for the country's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru , and calling him the founder of Indian democracy, Tharoor also said it was necessary to acknowledge Nehru's mistakes, adding that blaming him alone for India's problems is unjustified.Speaking at the fourth edition of the Kerala Legislative Assembly International Book Festival (KLIBF), Tharoor spoke on the BJP government's treatment of Nehru's legacy.""I am a fan of Jawaharlal Nehru, but not an uncritical fan. I greatly admire his mind and outlook, and I have deep respect for him, though I cannot support all his beliefs and policies 100%. Many of the things he did deserve the highest appreciation. Most importantly, it was Nehru who firmly established democracy in India... I would not say that they (the Modi government) are anti-democratic, but they are certainly anti-Nehru. Nehru has been turned into a convenient scapegoat,"" he said.Recalling the 1962 India–China war, the Thiruvananthapuram MP said, ""In some cases, their (Modi government's) criticism may have a basis. For instance, the 1962 defeat against China can partly be attributed to some of Nehru’s decisions.""He then turned his focus to the ruling BJP, adding, ""But what they do now is blame Nehru for everything, regardless of the issue.""In recent times, Tharoor's stance and political alignment have come under close scrutiny. Unlike many other party leaders, he does not always adhere to strict partyline statements, often appearing less comfortable with unquestioned loyalty to the Congress high command.Reflecting on his journey as a writer, Tharoor said his love for reading began in childhood due to asthma. With no television or mobile phones, books became his constant companions.He revealed that he wrote his first novel at a very young age, though it was later lost to an ink spillage. His biography of Sree Narayana Guru marks his 28th book.Tharoor also mentioned that while reading habits are declining globally, Kerala continues to lead in reading culture. He said he wrote ""The Great Indian Novel"" in 1989 as a satirical work, a genre that was largely absent in India at the time.Addressing the younger generation, Tharoor suggested that shorter books with fewer pages may be more appealing to readers who struggle to find time. He also fondly recalled his college days at St Stephen’s College, Delhi, remembering a stage production where he played Antony while filmmaker Mira Nair portrayed Cleopatra.","Senior Congress leader and MP Shashi Tharoor spoke at the fourth edition of the Kerala Legislative Assembly International Book Festival.

My Two Cents On This Mock Trade

The Philadelphia Phillies are preparing for the possibility that J.T. Realmuto will not return for 2026. Contract talks have not moved, and pitchers and catchers are close to reporting. With no clear answer yet, the team is looking at alternatives.One name that keeps coming up is Ryan Jeffers of the Minnesota Twins. The Phillies see him as a realistic option if Realmuto leaves in free agency. His age, contract status, and recent production make him a practical target rather than a splash move.JT Realmuto is 35 and coming off a quieter season at the plate. Even so, his track record means other teams are interested, and his next contract is expected to be expensive. That has pushed the Philadelphia Phillies to explore the trade market rather than wait and react late.Jeffers fits what the Phillies are looking for. He is younger, costs far less, and is under team control for 2026 through arbitration. At $6.7 million, he would give the team stability behind the plate without locking them into a long-term deal.Ryan Jeffers brings power that plays well at catcher and steady defense.In 2025, he produced a strong OPS and handled his defensive duties cleanly. While he does not match Realmuto’s arm or speed, he offers reliable all-around play and is entering his prime years.For the Phillies, he would be a bridge option. They stay competitive now while keeping future flexibility.A possible deal would send outfielder Justin Crawford and pitcher Gage Wood to Minnesota. Crawford is one of the Philadelphia Phillies’ top prospects, and Wood adds pitching depth. The Twins are looking to restock with young talent after recent roster changes, and this type of return fits that goal.The deal would not require Philadelphia to move a big-league contract, keeping the payroll clean.Also read: MLB trade rumors: Chicago Cubs predicted to pursue $33 million Toronto Blue Jays star infielder post blockbuster Edward Cabrera deal Philadelphia would get a younger, cheaper catcher who can start right away. Minnesota would turn a player nearing free agency into long-term pieces. If Realmuto moves on, Jeffers is a sensible next step rather than a risky gamble.","The Philadelphia Phillies are preparing for the possibility that J.T. Realmuto will not return for 2026.

Trade discussions around the Los Angeles Lakers are picking up, and one name keeps coming up: Dillon Brooks. With the deadline approaching, the Lakers are exploring ways to improve a roster that still leans heavily on its stars.The idea is simple. Pair LeBron James and Luka Dončić with a wing who defends hard, takes tough assignments, and doesn’t need the ball. Brooks, currently with the Phoenix Suns, fits that description and may be available as Phoenix adjusts its roster.The Los Angels Lakers’ biggest issue this season has been defense on the perimeter. Dillon Brooks is known for guarding top scorers and staying physical for full games. That matters for a team where LeBron is 41 and Luka carries a heavy offensive load.Brooks doesn’t need plays called for him. He shoots well enough from three to keep defenses honest and focuses most of his energy on defense. That role fits cleanly next to two ball-dominant stars.One proposed idea involves a three-team deal. The Los Angeles Lakers would send out Gabe Vincent, Max Christie, and a protected first-round pick. Dillon Brooks’ $23 million salary would be moved to Los Angeles, while Phoenix takes back a veteran minimum deal to help with cap flexibility.A third team, such as Utah, could be included to balance salaries and receive young players like Jalen Hood-Schifino along with draft value. This setup allows the Lakers to add Brooks without emptying their rotation.Los Angeles Lakers add a proven defender who can take pressure off LeBron James and Luka Doncic on the other end of the floor. Phoenix clears money and reduces a crowded wing group as it reshapes around Devin Booker. The third team turns contracts into picks and young depth.Dillon Brooks’ defensive rating and steady steal numbers stand out on a Lakers team that ranks near the bottom of the league defensively.Also read: NBA trade rumors: Boston Celtics could chase $107 million Milwaukee Bucks superstar to form stellar duo with Jayson Tatum The Risks InvolvedBrooks has dealt with minor injuries in recent seasons, and his outspoken style may not suit every locker room.

Taylor Swift’s boyfriend, Travis Kelce, is speculated to be retiring this season

Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce have had a pretty hard time this season as the Kansas City Chiefs have recorded a pretty average performance on the field this time.With the season coming to an end now, Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce seem to be focused on their wedding.

Luke Rockhold questions Bo Nickal’s fighting credentials



Luke Rockhold GOES OFF on Bo Nickal: 'He hasn't done anything' | RAF 5

Luke Rockhold reacts to Bo Nickal’s RAF 5 comments



Luke Rockhold just shared his unfiltered opinion when asked about Bo Nickal ahead of RAF 5 in Sunrise, Florida. With a wrestling main event against Colby Covington approaching, the former UFC middleweight champion shifted attention to a rising prospect he believes has spoken far beyond his resume.The comments followed Nickal’s recent rebound win and his public belief that he deserved a larger spotlight at the event. Rockhold believes that Nickal’s confidence crossed a line. Still, his message was brutal and certainly bone-piercing.Luke Rockhold’s criticism centered on Nickal’s mindset and past performance. Speaking to MMA Junkie, he contrasted Nickal with veterans who have carried championship pressure. “Colby's been on top for a long time; he has a character, and he does what he does, but you know he's not a bad guy,” Rockhold said, adding that he is also not weak.He then turned his attention to Nickal. “There's guys like Bo Nickel out there talking too much. You quit. You don't have that fight in you. You're a competitor. You're not a fighter. I respect fighters, not competitors.”Rockhold pointed directly to Nickal’s loss against Reinier de Ridder at UFC on ESPN 67.“He quit against RDR,” Rockhold said. “Before the knee even hit him, you can see the breaking in his mind.” He added that Nickal’s habit of talking without high-level wins stood out. “You haven't done anything, you haven't beat anybody.”Tensions increased after Nickal suggested he deserved the RAF 5 main event over Rockhold and Covington. Rockhold addressed that directly, pointing to championships and years spent at the top. “The whole reason this sport is here, is on this stage, is because of us, and you haven't touched anything,” he said. “You're talking about two guys that have gotten gold. I've gotten a lot of gold in my life. And you've done nothing. ”Rockhold dismissed comparisons between collegiate wrestling success and elite MMA careers. “You're out here asking me when I've won. What have you won? Anything other than college?” he said. “Nothing matters until you're on a world stage.”He closed his remarks with a blunt message aimed at Nickal’s approach to the sport. “Just shut up, bite the bullet and get to work, and become a man.”As RAF 5 approaches, Rockhold faces Covington in the main event, while Nickal competes against Yoel Romero.Also Read: Floyd Mayweather's daughter Yaya Mayweather raises eyebrows with cryptic post seemingly aimed at NBA YoungBoy following their son’s birthday",Luke Rockhold questioned Bo Nickal's fighting credentials ahead of RAF 5.

Stefon Diggs and Cardi B’s nonstop drama emerges as a growing Patriots distraction ahead of the NFL playoffs despite Drake Maye’s elite MVP form,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/stefon-diggs-and-cardi-bs-nonstop-drama-emerges-as-a-growing-patriots-distraction-ahead-of-the-nfl-playoffs-despite-drake-mayes-elite-mvp-form/articleshow/126404396.cms,"Stefon Diggs, Cardi B (Getty Images)

New England Patriots face growing Stefon Diggs distraction before playoffs

Update:

The New England Patriots are winning games again, but the noise around them refuses to fade quietly. Foxborough has always known how to handle pressure. What feels new is how often football headlines now compete with celebrity drama. Inside the building, optimism runs high around a second-year quarterback who already looks like the future of the franchise. Outside it, the conversation keeps drifting toward social media clips, relationship rumors, and tabloid-style chaos that threatens to pull attention away from the field.That contrast defines this Patriots season. On one end is the wholesome image of Drake Maye’s inner circle, led by Ann Michael Maye, whose viral moments feel harmless and community driven. On the other is a constant swirl around Stefon Diggs and his superstar partner Cardi B, a storyline that never seems to cool down for long. The disconnect tests the calm culture Mike Vrabel is trying to protect.The uncomfortable truth is that the New England Patriots need Stefon Diggs, even when the attention becomes exhausting. Strip away the drama and the numbers tell a blunt story. Diggs was the engine of the passing attack, finishing with 1,013 receiving yards. No other wide receiver came close. Kayshon Boutte trailed by 462 yards, while tight end Hunter Henry ranked second overall with 768.Without Diggs’ explosiveness, Drake Maye’s ceiling drops fast.That is why patience exists where it normally would not. If Stefon Diggs carried a lower profile, the tolerance would likely be gone already. But playoff football is ruthless, and Maye needs a receiver who can flip momentum in a single snap if the Patriots want a legitimate Super Bowl push.The latest Stefon Diggs and Cardi B episode arrived at the worst possible moment, just as the postseason began. The rap icon clapped back at Diggs’ most recent accuser, extending a pattern that has followed the team all year, even after the couple welcomed their newborn son in November. It makes for viral content, not ideal preparation for chasing a Lombardi Trophy.That context made the Patriots’ timing feel deliberate when they released a mic’d up sideline exchange.""I can throw some blocks if you need,"" Diggs quips.""You need to shut the f**k up,"" Vrabel retorts.The exchange came across as playful, almost reassuring. The message was clear. Diggs is engaged. Vrabel is in control. Rookie lineman Will Campbell later praised Vrabel’s ability to connect with different personalities, reinforcing the idea of unity.Still, even the strongest coaches grow weary of constant off-field noise. As the Chargers loom in the Wild Card round, the Patriots know one thing for certain. Talent wins games, but distractions have ended more than a few championship dreams. Whether this one proves manageable will define how far New England Patriots really goes.Stefon Diggs has received an updated court date ahead of the playoffs. According to court documents, his arraignment has been postponed to February 13. The original date for his strangulation and assault charges was scheduled for January 23.Also Read: John Harbaugh's future: 3 possible landing spots for former Ravens' coach","New England Patriots face growing Stefon Diggs distraction before playoffs.

Corey Perry placed on non-roster status by Los Angeles Kings

On Wednesday, the Los Angeles Kings said that forward Corey Perry had been given non-roster playing status, which means he can leave the team to deal with a family issue, and the company said that Perry is going home because someone in his family is sick, but they didn't say when he would be back or give any other details.The news comes at a very important time in the NHL season, when the Kings are trying to get into the playoffs in the Western Conference, and Perry's absence is a big change for the team because he has been a key part of the Kings' lineup as a veteran player and a competitive edge, and this news quickly made its way into the latest NHL news roundup, which got a lot of attention from fans all over the league.Corey Perry signed a one-year, $3.5 million contract with the Los Angeles Kings ahead of the 2025–26 campaign after his stint with the Edmonton Oilers. The 40-year-old forward missed the opening weeks of the season due to a preseason knee injury but returned to make a strong impact. In 35 games, Perry registered nine goals and 12 assists for 21 points, placing him among the team’s top contributors alongside Anze Kopitar.Following Perry’s departure, the Los Angeles Kings recalled forwards Andre Lee and Taylor Ward from their American Hockey League affiliate, the Ontario Reign, on an emergency basis.The call-ups are intended to provide immediate depth as the team prepares for upcoming NHL matchups during a tight schedule.Los Angeles currently sits in a Wild Card position in the Pacific Division, making every NHL match today crucial. While Perry’s time away is unrelated to on-ice performance or injury, his leadership will be missed in the dressing room. The Kings organization and fans alike have expressed support, with hopes that Perry will return once his personal situation allows.The organization emphasized privacy and support, asking fans to respect Perry and his family during this time.

A calm series of Instagram stories that showed everyday moments without trying to steal the spotlight

(Image via: Livvy Dunne's IG Story)

Paul Skenes is seldom out of the limelight even when he is not on the mound. Being one of the most closely monitored young talents in the baseball field, each action of his is likely to attract attention. This time, though, the attention was shifted quite quietly with a series of Instagram stories posted by his girlfriend, Livvy Dunne.Having no bold headings or a clear desire to go viral, Dunne still provided the fans with something they hardly tend to receive a more intimate, less glamorous glimpse into life that exists far beyond the game, gun measurements, and post-game commentary. Their stories were autobiographical, yet not imposed, and that is the very reason why they felt so popular.Instead of focusing on a single image that is very vivid, the stories illustrated by Dunne were best described as a series. One of the clip showed a serene pool atmosphere with a clear sky immediately creating a relaxed vibe and habitualness. It was not melodramatic or posed dramatically. Rather, it was a portrayal of calm, the type that is a contrast to the stress that awaits Skenes during the season.One of the stories tilted towards humour and practical knowledge. The the frame was filled with a bright yellow Pittsburgh Steelers Terrible Towel indoors that was accompanied with the caption, “we like em big.”The line, held as it appears, was charming and natural. It also silently established a sense of attachment to Pittsburgh that fans ultimately take pride in, particularly when an up-and-comer starts to have a sense of belonging to a city other than his job.Dunne also had an airy outdoor scene in the vicinity of water, and surrounded by blue skies and an overbent tree. The scene implied spending time out of strict timetables and provided some carefree, even contemplative touch to the general atmosphere of the tales. Even a slight glimpse of the dog of the couple lying calmly by the pool with a caption “divaa”, fitted right into the stream and did not make the center stage.These silent Instagram stories did something potent in the case of Dunne whose social media presence is much broader than sports, and in the case of Skenes whose career is placed under constant scrutiny. They were reminding followers that there is no life around elite athletes that is never loud. At times it is characterized by little silent incidents that speak volumes louder than any words.","Livvy Dunne posted a series of Instagram stories that showed everyday moments without trying to steal the spotlight.

Al Michaels addresses retirement talk as fan criticism grows



Al Michaels has heard the noise, but he is not backing away from the microphone. At 81, the legendary broadcaster remains the lead voice for Prime Video’s NFL coverage, even as social media scrutiny grows louder with every missed name or subdued reaction during key moments.Despite the criticism, Michaels insists he still belongs in the booth. With Prime Video drawing massive audiences and playoff games on the horizon, the veteran announcer maintains that his passion for calling NFL games has not faded.For decades, Al Michaels has been one of the most recognizable voices in sports broadcasting. From Super Bowls to weekly NFL matchups, his career has spanned generations. Now in his eighth decade, Michaels continues to call high-profile NFL games for Amazon Prime Video, a role that has kept him firmly in the national spotlight.That visibility has also brought increased criticism. Fans have pointed to recent on-air mistakes, including misidentifying Falcons running back Bijan Robinson during a December broadcast. In other instances, viewers have questioned his enthusiasm, particularly during high-leverage moments, fueling recurring calls for Michaels to retire.Michaels, however, made it clear in a recent conversation with Christopher “Mad Dog” Russo that he is not ready to step aside.“I always felt, ‘I’ll go as long as I can or I’m wanted,’ but I have to be able to know that I can do the game at the level that satisfies me,” Michaels said. “If I feel not what I have been or the way I perceive myself to have been, that’ll be time to step away. I don’t feel that way right now.”He also pointed to Prime Video’s strong viewership numbers, including a Christmas night NFL broadcast that drew roughly 21 million viewers, as proof that the coverage continues to resonate. Michaels emphasized that he still enjoys the work and believes his performance meets his own expectations.His stance mirrors comments he made earlier in the 2025 season to Sports Illustrated, where he said he felt “really good” and would be open to returning if Prime Video wanted him back. Michaels acknowledged the decision is a two-way process, but stressed that his desire to continue remains firm.While fan backlash has not disappeared, Prime Video has shown no public indication that a change is imminent. For now, Al Michaels remains behind the mic, confident in his ability and unwilling to let outside pressure define the end of his storied NFL broadcasting career.","Al Michaels says he's not ready to retire.

Trae Young’s bids an emotional farewell



Trae Young’s high-stakes move to the Capital



Trae Young’s move from Atlanta to Washington marks the end of an era, and the 27-year-old shared an emotional message before leaving. The 4-time All-Star is ready and geared up to start anew with Washington Wizards after being traded by the Atlanta Hawks. As per ESPN’s Sham Charania, this blockbuster deal sends Young to Wizards in exchange for CJ McCollum and Corey Kispert. The confirmation for this deal broke during the Hawks vs Pelicans on Wednesday when Trae Young was seen sitting on the bench in casual clothes after sustaining an injury last month against Trail Blazers.While Young departs as Atlanta’s all-time leader in assists and three-pointers, the trade follows months of speculation regarding his fit in Quin Snyder’s system and the Hawks' recent success during his injury-related absences.Trae was drafted as the 5th pick by Dallas Mavericks in 2018, but was traded to the Hawks on the same day and has been with with them since then. After spending seven seasons with Hawks, Trae surely had a lot to say before packing his bags.He started with quoting Jeremiah 29:11, “For I know the plans I have for you- declares the Lord.”“The last few years weren't how I wanted them to be. Expectations that we created for ourselves, reaching heights that Atlanta has never reached before.”said Young. “Bringing a championship to Atlanta was always my goal. However, between the injuries, the setbacks and situations that didn’t make sense, we never truly got to see our full potential.”Trae, appreciating the city of Atlanta wrote, “The city that raised me and taught me so much will always be a chapter in this story.” Ending the post Trae talked about his expectations towards the unseen future, “I’m walking to the next chapter ecstatic, with my head high and my eyes forward. It’s time to see what’s possible when the support is real and the vision is clear. We Move.”When the news of Trae’s trade broke out, the match between Hawks and Pelicans was reaching its climax, it seemed like it was also his career’s final point. Young was on the bench after getting sidelined with a quad contusion, and when he heard the news, he just walked towards the tunnel while sharing emotional goodbyes with training staff and fans. The last time fans saw him walking towards Hawks' locker room.For Wizards, this trade is an aggressive ""buy low"" strategy as by moving McCollum’s expiring contract, they gain a dynamic centerpiece who led the league in assists just a season ago. Despite Wizards' current 10-26 record, the front office views Young as the creative engine that will help them unlock the potential of their picks like Alex Sarr and Bilal Coulibaly. However, the move is not without its hurdles as Young is currently managing a quad injury with no expected return date. But with Trae’s ability and talents, easing in the Wizards’ roster will not be a big deal.Also read: “Too delicate”: Fans react to Anthony Davis’s hand injury in Mavs' close loss to Jazz","Trae Young traded to Washington Wizards in exchange for CJ McCollum and Corey Kispert.

Ric Flair’s net worth in 2025 and what it reflects

Ric Flair’s wrestling career, earnings, and endorsements

Ric Flair is still one of the most famous names in the history of wrestling. Well into his post-ring prime decades later, the “Nature Boy” still draws eyes with appearances, branding agreements, and a seemingly never-ending coverage of his life and career. But as legendary as he is, Flair's net worth in 2025 paints a much more complex picture than many fans would expect.Years ago, Flair made millions when wrestling boomed, but behind the scenes, financial realities have changed his wealth. A combination of medical expenses, lifestyle spending, and failed business ventures. Combined, they tell the tale of why one of wrestling's all-time greats is often associated with a surprisingly small fortune in his name to this day.One of the finest WWE wrestlers in the world today, Ric Flair’s net worth in the year 2025 is reported close to around $500,000. That number is especially notable for a competitor who held world championships with various promotions and headlined dozens of major events. Thus, financial analysts and wrestling historians alike attribute this to a mixture of high personal expenses during his prime, numerous divorces, and huge medical expenses after a few health crises.ID@undefinedCaption not available.ID@undefinedCaption not available.Even Flair has been open about living the high life, which matched what fans saw on TV. We made this point before, that image solidified his spot in cultural history, but also boxed in his long-term wealth compared to some other big-name athletes who took a more traditional investment approach.Flashy Ric Flair character through NWA, WCW, and WWE, a 16-time world champion, and a two-time Hall of Famer. Flair made a great deal of money throughout his career from top payouts, television, merchandise, and advertising.His income increased after wrestling through endorsements and licensing deals. The guy's visage and catchphrases have graced clothing, collectibles, energy drinks, and pop culture crossovers. Of course, contracts back in the wrestling days sometimes restricted long-term royalties, so a great deal of those nostalgically iconic moments may not have earned the same continuously rolling money as fans might expect.Over the past several years, Flair has embraced brand-forward initiatives. They've ranged from restaurant concepts and cannabis partnerships to drink collaborations, all of which leverage his name for a new generation. In reality, a handful of projects picked up hype early on, while other projects deal with existential crises due to operational complexity or public outcry.Also Read: Bron Breakker and Izzy Dame combined net worth: WWE contracts, endorsements, brand deals, and more","Ric Flair’s net worth in the year 2025 is reported close to around $500,000.

Seiya Suzuki’s contracts, salaries, and sponsorships in 2025

Airi Hatakeyama's career in media and gymnastics, and the net worth of the duo

The financial power of Seiya Suzuki is largely based on his $85 million, five-year contract with the Cubs, which guarantees him a smooth ride through 2026. His total earnings during his career, worth $67 million, combined with his endorsements in both Japan and the U.S. , make his net worth approximately $70 million. Due to his endorsements, Olympic background, and steady performance in MLB, Suzuki is not only a pillar of the Cubs but also a worldwide sports brand with financial security for a long time to come. Airi Hatakeyama was an internationally recognized rhythmic gymnast from Japan who eventually stopped competing but continued to impress the world as a representative of her nation.Seiya Suzuki's monetary power stands firmly on his six-year, $85 million contract with the Chicago Cubs. His Olympic heritage and MLB recognition have turned him into a favored person for promotional activities, thus augmenting his financial portfolio. By 2025, Suzuki’s fortune is projected to be between $68 and $70 million, which is a combination of his contract, endorsements, and past winnings in Nippon Professional Baseball.With guaranteed payments until 2026 and huge sponsorships, the Japanese superstar's financial situation has been stabilized, hence making him one of the most successful Japanese players in MLB and a key part of the Cubs' future plans.

What’s next for Anthony Davis and Mavericks?



In the last few minutes of Dallas Mavericks vs. Utah Jazz at Delta Center, things went from bad to worse for the Mavs. They faced a double blow as they not only dropped a close-contested game to Jazz but also had their star center, Anthony Davis, headline another injury report.With just three minutes left on the clock in the fourth quarter, Davis, while defending Jazz’s #23 Markkanen, suffered a left hand injury. Though he tried to remain on the court for another minute, the pain seemed too much, and he had to exit the hardwood. His absence from Mavs' defense in the last few moments was definitely something that the fans didn't anticipate, but his injury was within their scope.The Mavericks’ 114-116 loss to Jazz marks their 24th loss of this season, and it was definitely not a sight they wanted to see after their last two consecutive wins against Rockets and Kings. With three minutes left in the fourth quarter, Mavs’ rising rookie, Cooper Flagg, went for a jump shot but missed it, giving the opposition possession of the ball.Jazz were 2 points down, and when Anderson got the defensive rebound, he sent it straight to Sensabaugh, and then Markkanen, who went for a drive in with Davis on defense and converted it. But Davis was seen clutching his left hand. Bad news for the Mavs front office, but the internet got its fodder.One fan commented, “Every season, the same fear.” The second fan wrote, “He needs a new trainer - too delicate.” “Bro there is no way. He's never get a max,” the third fan said.Understanding, Davis might be sidelined due to this, a fan commented, “Hate to see this… prayers up.” While another fan went on and called AD, “Bro be so fragile…” A fan, in frustration, even went on to say, “He needs to retire I said this last year.”Davis and injury have been a combo that no one likes in this league, especially the teams’ front offices. He finished the night with 21 points, 11 rebounds, and 4 assists, with 10 shots made from the field. But his exit from the game brought back the Day-to-Davis narrative as fans voiced their frustration over his untimely injuries and inconsistency.The NBA trade deadline is nearing, and rumors about Davis’ trade have been swirling around. The front office of the Dallas Mavericks will be open if any potential offers approach them. Although Davis remains a player with game-changing potential, his inconsistency and constant battles with injuries add a layer of anxiety. He has only played in 20 games this season. Having him on the court is like either a hit or a miss, and that is something the Mavs would love to avoid as they want to build an NBA championship team around their rising rookie superstar, Cooper Flagg.Also read: “She’s my rock”: Thunder superstar Shai Gilgeous-Alexander’s heartfelt tribute to wife, Hailey Summers, leaves fans emotional","Anthony Davis suffered a left hand injury in Dallas Mavericks' 114-116 loss to Utah Jazz.

Tarik Skubal trade buzz grows as New York Yankees search for ace help

Tarik Skubal is back in the middle of MLB trade rumors, and this time the New York Yankees are one of the teams being talked about. In early January 2026, reports out of the United States said the Yankees are actively looking for a starting pitcher because Gerrit Cole is not expected to be ready for the start of the season after Tommy John surgery.The Yankees need help fast. Their front office has been speaking with teams across baseball. With Edward Cabrera already traded to the Chicago Cubs on January 7, the Yankees are now being linked to Tarik Skubal, Freddy Peralta, and MacKenzie Gore as they try to fix their rotation before spring training.Tarik Skubal, the Detroit Tigers’ left-hander and two-time Cy Young Award winner, is entering the final year of his contract.Earlier this week, U.S. media reported that Skubal and the Tigers failed to agree on a new deal and went to arbitration. That move quickly sparked trade talk around the league.MLB insider Jon Heyman said this week that any team wanting Skubal would need to give up “half their team.”That comment made it clear how highly Detroit values its ace. Skubal has been one of baseball’s best pitchers over the past two seasons, and the Tigers are in no rush to move him unless the return is massive.The New York Yankees are watching closely. With Gerrit Cole still rehabbing and not expected back in April, New York is exploring every possible top-level arm.While Skubal fits the need, league insiders believe the price may be too steep, even for a team known for bold moves.With Skubal likely costing a huge package, the Yankees have also shifted strong focus to Freddy Peralta and MacKenzie Gore.Freddy Peralta, the Milwaukee Brewers’ All-Star right-hander, is also in the final year of his deal. He is coming off a big season where he went 17–6 with a career-best 2.70 ERA and led the National League in wins.MacKenzie Gore, the Washington Nationals’ left-hander, is another name in talks.Unlike Peralta and Skubal, Gore has three years left on his contract, which gives Washington leverage but also makes him a long-term option for any team that trades for him.The Yankees were previously linked to Edward Cabrera, but that path closed when Miami traded him to Chicago.Now, New York is weighing whether to pay big in prospects for a star like Skubal or make a cleaner move for Peralta or Gore.If no deal happens soon, the Yankees are expected to open the season with Max Fried, Luis Gil, Will Warren, and Cam Schlittler while waiting for Gerrit Cole, Carlos Rodón, and Clarke Schmidt to return from surgery.Also Read: MLB Trade Rumors: Ketel Marte Trade Buzz Grows As New York Yankees, Chicago Cubs, And Los Angeles Dodgers Watch Arizona Diamondbacks","Tarik Skubal, the Detroit Tigers’ left-hander and two-time Cy Young Award winner, is entering the final year of his contract.

Jake Savicki says Aaron Judge does not show true leadership traits

Aaron Judge is once again in the middle of a big baseball debate. This time, it is not about home runs or contracts. It is about leadership. On Wednesday, in the United States, MLB content creator and coach Jake Savicki said he does not believe Aaron Judge is a true leader, even though Judge has been the New York Yankees captain since the end of the 2022 season.Jake Savicki shared his thoughts on the latest episode of his “Hold My Ball” podcast. His comments quickly spread across social media. With Aaron Judge also set to lead Team USA at the 2026 World Baseball Classic, the timing of the statement made even more people stop and listen.Speaking on Wednesday’s podcast episode, Jake Savicki made his view very clear. “I don’t think Aaron Judge is a leader,” Savicki said.“I think there’s very little emotion he shows. You can’t just make a leader out of a guy. If he’s not a natural leader, then you’re not going to get a leader out of him.”Savicki explained that, for him, leadership is not only about numbers on the field. He said there is a big difference between being a great player and being a vocal, emotional presence in the clubhouse.To explain his point, he brought up Los Angeles Dodgers infielder Miguel Rojas. Savicki said players like Rojas give something extra that does not always show in stats.“There’s leaders that produce, and then there’s leaders like a Miguel Rojas,” Savicki added. “There’s a reason he was even in that game.”Savicki was talking about the 2025 World Series. Miguel Rojas did not play in the first five games. Dodgers manager Dave Roberts put him in Game 6 mainly for defense.But in Game 7, Rojas changed everything. He hit a game-tying solo home run off Toronto Blue Jays closer Jeff Hoffman in the ninth inning.Later, he made a game-saving defensive play. The Dodgers went on to win the game in 11 innings.Savicki said moments like that show leadership in action. In the same episode, Jake Savicki also questioned how the New York Yankees are building around Aaron Judge.“Why haven’t they signed Tucker already? Why haven’t they signed Belly already?” Savicki asked, referring to Kyle Tucker and Cody Bellinger.“Why haven’t they signed Bo Bichette? Why haven’t they signed Alex Bregman? What are they doing?” Savicki said the Yankees are wasting Aaron Judge’s best years.He also criticized the team’s handling of top prospect Spencer Jones, saying the young outfielder has played well in the minors but has not been given real chances.“They’re called the Evil Empire for a reason,” Savicki said. “People are enjoying the fall of the Yankees.But I like baseball, and I want to see Aaron Judge get what he deserves.” Aaron Judge has won major personal awards and broken records.But he has reached the World Series only once. That came in 2024, when the Yankees lost to the Los Angeles Dodgers in five games.Also Read: MLB Trade Rumors: Ketel Marte Trade Buzz Grows As New York Yankees, Chicago Cubs, And Los Angeles Dodgers Watch Arizona Diamondbacks",MLB content creator and coach Jake Savicki says Aaron Judge does not show true leadership traits.

Dalton Kincaid injury update: Will the Bills TE play in this week’s playoff game vs. Jaguars?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/dalton-kincaid-injury-update-will-the-bills-te-play-in-this-weeks-playoff-game-vs-jaguars/articleshow/126441514.cms,"Image via IMAGN

Why Dalton Kincaid’s availability matters for Buffalo

Also Read:

The Buffalo Bills have received a major boost ahead of their AFC Wild Card playoff clash against the Jacksonville Jaguars. Tight end Dalton Kincaid, who has been dealing with a knee injury, is expected to be available for Sunday’s crucial game.Kincaid’s fitness has been closely monitored all week after he was listed as a limited participant in practice on Wednesday and Thursday. The tight end missed Week 17 due to the knee issue but returned in Week 18 against the New York Jets, easing concerns about a long-term setback.On Friday, Bills head coach Sean McDermott provided encouraging news. According to reports, Kincaid is expected to be removed from the injury report entirely, meaning he will not carry any game-day designation. This strongly suggests that the Bills are confident in his health heading into the playoffs.Kincaid has been one of the most reliable targets in the Bills’ offense when healthy. He caught 39 passes for 571 yards and five touchdowns in 12 games this season, making him a critical safety valve for quarterback Josh Allen.The figures make it plain how much he affected things. Buffalo scored more than 30 points a game when Kincaid was on the field, but only 23 points per game when he wasn't.It's important to note that all of Allen's interceptions this season happened when Kincaid wasn't on the field. This shows how important the tight end is to keeping the offense consistent.Kincaid also posted one of the best efficiency numbers among NFL tight ends, recording a passer rating of over 149 when targeted. That kind of production is difficult to replace, especially in a playoff environment.The Jaguars’ defense has struggled against tight ends throughout the season, ranking near the bottom of the league in yards allowed to the position. This could work in Buffalo’s favor, especially if the Jaguars succeed in slowing down the Bills’ strong rushing attack.With Jacksonville expected to focus heavily on stopping the run, Kincaid could be used frequently on short and intermediate routes. Along with fellow tight end Dawson Knox, he gives the Bills flexibility in both blocking and passing situations.All signs point toward Dalton Kincaid playing on Sunday. While the Bills will still monitor his knee closely, the expectation is that he will be fully available and involved in the game plan.As Buffalo looks to break through in the postseason, having one of its most dependable offensive weapons healthy could make a significant difference in a tightly contested playoff matchup against Jacksonville.","Dalton Kincaid is expected to be removed from the injury report entirely, meaning he will not carry any game-day designation.

Dinah Mattingly’s net worth, investments, and more

NBA Hall of Famer Larry Bird is one such player who is well known for his excellent psychological play. The Boston Celtics drafted Bird in the 1978 NBA Draft, and he played with the Celtics for 13 seasons, winning three NBA championships with the team. Bird is the only player to have been named Rookie of the Year, MVP, Finals MVP, All-Star MVP, Coach of the Year, and Executive of the Year, and still to this day holds that position. Bird started playing basketball young during his college days, as he was attending Indiana State University, where he played three years for the Sycamores, before being selected in 1978 by the Boston Celtics. He made his NBA debut in the 1979-80 regular season. Bird spent most of his NBA career playing for the Boston Celtics for 13 seasons, where he led the team to the NBA Finals five times and won three Championships with them. Ever since entering the NBA, Bird began a rivalry with yet another NBA legend, Magic Johnson. However, the two shared a special moment together, in 1992, where the duo was set off to play in the 1992 Olympics that was held in Barcelona, in what would later become known as the Dream Team, consisting of other star players like Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen, Charles Barkley, and such, where the Dream Team ended up winning a gold medal, and was inducted into the Hall of Fame, in which Bird was a member.However, when it comes to his personal relationships, Larry Bird has always been a very private person.

Bird then married Dinah Mattingly in 1989, and the couple later adopted two children together. And when it comes to net worth, the couple has a combined net worth of about $76 million, according to various reliable sources like the Celebrity Net Worth, considering the player's career earnings, brand endorsements, and the couple's shared assets.

Bird was marketed for Heinz Corporation by endorsing their products. He made his Hollywood debut with the film Spice Jam, earning more fans beyond the NBA forum. He also owns a real estate business in his hometown of French Lick, according to Sportskeeda.

Some of these films are A Basketball Legend, Magic & Bird: A Courtship of Rivals, among others.Dinah Mattingly has a net worth of $1 million, per What's Magazine.

Why Bryson DeChambeau's LIV golf frustrations spark skepticism among PGA Tour players despite his rising YouTube fame?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/international-sports/why-bryson-dechambeaus-liv-golf-frustrations-spark-skepticism-among-pga-tour-players-despite-his-rising-youtube-fame/articleshow/126441197.cms,"Why Bryson DeChambeau's LIV golf frustrations spark skepticism among PGA Tour players despite his rising YouTube fame?

Bryson DeChambeau won’t quit golf for YouTube thinks Michael Kim



Bryson DeChambeau looks for ways to challenge himself



There has been much discussion about Bryson DeChambeau's future, particularly since Brooks Koepka left LIV. The 5x major champion’s contract with LIV ran through 2026, but he left earlier. Notably, with DeChambeau’s contract coming to an end in 2026, many wonder what he will do next. Many anticipate he will take up content creation on a full-time basis. Michael Kim, a pro on the PGA Tour, isn't entirely persuaded.Kim commented under an X post, hinting that the LIV golfer might be a full-time YouTube golfer who only performs in major events.“Idk Bryson well, but he is a golf competitive psycho. YouTube has been great for him, but I have a very hard time believing that just YouTube will fulfill that competitiveness. They both need each other, and I would be shocked if they don’t get a deal done.”There are more than 2.56 million subscribers on Bryson DeChambeau's YouTube channel, with over 244 videos, and his videos have gained more than 500 million views. Each video receives 2 million per video. The LIV golfer's fame as a YouTube sensation has only increased over time.He enjoys a variety of challenges, such as the Break 50, Random Club Challenge, and Shot Cup Challenges, to make his content engaging and enjoyable.However, DeChambeau invites fellow golfers, YouTubers, athletes from other sports, and celebrities. Among the celebrities that have made appearances in his videos are Kevin Hart, Adam Sandler, Donald Trump, Jason Kidd, Phil Mickelson, and John Daly.This gave some fans and observers the impression that he could abandon professional golf in favor of a full-time career in entertainment. Michael Kim, however, disagrees. He feels it's improbable that DeChambeau will quit LIV and concentrate only on YouTube because of how competitive he is.DeChambeau is known for being a fiercely competitive professional golfer. He even took a unique physics-based approach to become one of the biggest drivers in golf. In 2021, the American professional declared that he would keep improving his skills in a ""relentless pursuit of excellence.” Therefore, he might not give up on competitive golf that easily. But the conclusion of the contract discussions will also have an impact.“Because I could just do YouTube golf and be totally fine as well,” is what DeChambeau said in an interview with Flushing It Golf.“I mean, look, it’s confidential. I’m not going to share too much, but the conversations are in process. We have to get to a place where both parties have a good understanding of one another. It is getting to a place that makes sense for both sides,” he claimed.Bryson DeChambeau discussed a mental quality that, in his opinion, keeps him concentrated under duress. In a Bryan Bros Golf video uploaded on December 29, 2025, the 2x US Open winner said that he tries to create a competitive atmosphere even when creating YouTube content.DeChambeau said, “That’s why I do YouTube challenges in content creation because it keeps me locked in.” That’s his way of getting comfortable in the most uncomfortable situations.A clean divorce from LIV Golf seems improbable for someone like Bryson DeChambeau, as Michael Kim's analysis highlights. While YouTube continues to grow its influence, the need for real competition may keep it tied to the Saudi-backed league.Also read: Bryson DeChambeau and Lilia Schneider combined net worth: LIV Golf earnings, endorsements, and relationship buzz","Bryson DeChambeau's contract with LIV Golf runs out in 2026.

‘Past girlfriends’ as ‘adversaries’? Donna Kelce’s ‘Traitors’ line lit up Travis and Jason Kelce’s dating discourse,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/past-girlfriends-as-adversaries-donna-kelces-traitors-line-lit-up-travis-and-jason-kelces-dating-discourse/articleshow/126436942.cms,"One sentence. A lot of noise. Donna Kelce’s ‘past girlfriends’ line on “The Traitors” had the internet reading between every word. (Images via Getty)

Donna Kelce’s ‘past girlfriends’ line landed because it hit Travis Kelce’s public dating history

The Traitors US | Friend or Foe? The Cast Predicts Who They’ll Meet in the Castle

The timing is not subtle with ‘ The Traitors ’ premiere and Taylor Swift in the picture

Donna Kelce did not name names. She did not need to. In a promo video posted Wednesday, Jan. 7, the 73-year-old mother of Jason Kelce and Travis Kelce said she did not want to run into “Maybe some of my sons’ adversaries,” adding, “That could either be on other teams, or it could be coaches, or it could be past girlfriends.” The clip ran ahead of Peacock’s Season 4 premiere of “The Traitors” on Thursday, Jan. 8, at 9 p.m. ET, per Page Six, which also quoted the exchange.Donna Kelce framed it like a mom joke, but the phrasing did the work. She grouped “past girlfriends” with rival teams and coaches, and that is why it stuck. She also described them as “adversaries,” even if she delivered it with a wink.Multiple outlets picked up the moment, including Us Weekly, Parade, and Page Six. All of them pointed to the same core detail: she talked about “past girlfriends” as people she would rather not see inside the “Traitors” castle.The context matters. Jason Kelce has kept most of his dating life private before he married Kylie Kelce in 2018. Travis Kelce has not had that luxury. His relationships became public storylines.Before his engagement to Taylor Swift , Travis dated Kayla Nicole on and off for years before they split in 2022, per Us Weekly and Parade.He also dated Maya Benberry after his 2016 dating show “Chasing Kelce,” per Page Six. Donna Kelce did not point at any one woman. She still handed the internet a headline-ready quote.Donna Kelce has also joked about her sons’ dating lives before. On Jason and Travis’ “New Heights” podcast in May 2025, she said, “Jason, you didn’t really bring a lot of ladies home.” She followed that up with, “You dated but I didn’t know any of them,” and then added, “With Trav, I met one or two. I knew nothing of anybody you guys were dating in college. You told me zero.” Jason leaned into it with his own self-burn, saying, “I had zero game and I looked like an overweight oompa loompa,” before Donna replied, “You’ve changed, so that’s good. ”That track record is why her “Traitors” line reads less like a scandal and more like Donna Kelce staying consistent. She teases. The internet turns it into a referendum.Donna Kelce is stepping into a reality-TV format built for suspicion, alliances, and confessionals. Even a throwaway line becomes a plot hook. That is why her “past girlfriends” mention popped ahead of the Season 4 premiere on Thursday, Jan. 8.She also walked into this moment with her family already sitting under a microscope. Travis Kelce’s relationship with Swift became one of the most covered celebrity sports crossovers since they started dating in 2023. Donna Kelce has publicly supported it. In 2023, she told WSJ.com, “I can tell you this, he’s happier than I’ve seen him in a long time,” and added, “God bless him, he shot for the stars!”So when she casually lumps “past girlfriends” into the “adversaries” category, people read it through that lens. Fans treat it like a message. Even when it is not one.Donna Kelce also made clear she had her own wish list for the castle. She said she hoped to see Martha Stewart, Stevie Nicks, and Shaquille O’Neal, per Us Weekly and Page Six. She did not get that lineup. She did get a cast full of reality-TV and entertainment names, and she is now part of the story instead of just adjacent to it.Bottom line: Donna Kelce did not call out a specific ex. She did not accuse anyone of anything. She delivered one clean sentence that sounded like a mom joke, and it hit harder because Travis Kelce’s dating life has been public for years. That is the whole spark. That is why it traveled.","Donna Kelce's ‘past girlfriends’ line landed because it hit Travis Kelce’s public dating history. The 73-year-old mother of Jason Kelce said she did not want to run into “Maybe some of my sons’ adversaries,” adding, “That could either be on other teams, or it could be coaches, or It could be past girlfriends.”","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126437074,imgsize-66234,width-400,resizemode-4/donna-kelce-past-girlfriends-traitors-comment.jpg"

A senior Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) official’s comment calling former captain Tamim Iqbal ""an Indian agent"" has drawn criticism from players in the country. Tamim, one of Bangladesh’s leading openers, had advised the BCB not to be driven by emotion while deciding on the national team’s participation in the T20 World Cup in India.Nazmul, chairman of the BCB finance committee, made the remark in a Facebook post.""This time, the people of Bangladesh witnessed, with their own eyes, the emergence of yet another proven Indian agent,"" he wrote.The post received immediate backlash from former and current cricketers, including Taskin Ahmed, Mominul Haque, and Taijul Islam.The Cricketers’ Welfare Association of Bangladesh (CWAB) also expressed concern.""A comment made by BCB director M Nazmul Islam regarding former national captain Tamim Iqbal has come to the attention of the Cricketers' Welfare Association of Bangladesh. We are stunned, shocked, and outraged by it. Such a remark by a board official about the most successful opener in Bangladesh's history, who represented the country for 16 years, is utterly condemnable.""""Not only because it concerns a player like Tamim, but such comments about any cricketer of the country are unacceptable and insulting to the entire cricketing community,"" the players’ body said in a statement.The 36-year-old Tamim played 70 Tests, 243 ODIs, and 78 T20 Internationals for Bangladesh.""We strongly protest against this comment. When a responsible board director makes such remarks on a public platform, it also raises serious questions about the code of conduct of board officials,"" CWAB said.""We have already submitted a protest letter to the BCB president, demanding a public apology from the concerned board director and that he be brought under accountability. We hope the BCB president will take appropriate action as soon as possible,"" the statement added.Bangladesh had written to the International Cricket Council requesting their T20 World Cup games be moved out of India after the BCCI asked IPL franchise Kolkata Knight Riders to release Mustafizur Rahman ahead of the 2026 edition.""Cricket is the life of Bangladesh. A recent comment surrounding a former national captain who has made a major contribution to the game has caused many to reflect,"" said pacer Taskin.""I believe that such remarks directed at a former cricketer of the country are not helpful in the interest of Bangladesh cricket. I hope the concerned authorities will consider the matter seriously and adopt a more responsible stance in the future,"" he added.In 2007, Tamim’s half-century had helped Bangladesh eliminate India from the ODI World Cup in the Caribbean.Former Bangladesh captain Mominul said Nazmul’s remarks were unacceptable.""The comment made by BCB director M Nazmul Islam regarding former national captain Tamim Iqbal is completely unacceptable and insulting to the country's cricketing community. Such behaviour towards a cricketer is in direct conflict with the board's responsibility and ethics,"" Mominul said.""A senior cricketer was not given even the minimum respect; instead, he was deliberately humiliated in public. Such remarks show a lack of even basic decorum regarding where and how to speak while holding such a high responsibility.""I strongly condemn this comment and firmly demand a public apology from the concerned director and that he be brought under accountability.

Bangladesh pacer Mustafizur Rahman’s release from the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) squad for the IPL 2026 season has led to a dispute between the cricket boards of India and Bangladesh.Mustafizur, who was bought for Rs 9.20 crore at the auction last month, was released from the squad, a move that upset the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB). In recent days, reports on social media suggested that the BCCI was considering reversing the decision, but the BCB president has denied those claims.BCB president Aminul Islam Bulbul responded to reports that the BCCI had offered to allow Mustafizur to return to the IPL 2026 amid the ongoing issue between the two boards.After Mustafizur’s exit from the IPL was confirmed, relations between the BCCI and the BCB worsened on several fronts. Bangladesh has stopped the telecast of IPL matches in the country until further notice and has also refused to travel to India for the upcoming T20 World Cup.Some reports claimed that senior BCCI officials were not consulted before the decision to release Mustafizur and that the instruction came from the top level of the board.As speculation grew about a possible change in stance by the BCCI, Bulbul rejected the reports.""I have not had any written or verbal discussions (with the BCCI) regarding Mustafizur's (return to the IPL). I have not spoken to anyone from my board about this. There is no truth to this news,"" Bulbul was quoted as saying by Ajker Patrika.After Mustafizur’s release, the BCB informed the International Cricket Council that it would not play its matches in India during the T20 World Cup 2026, citing security concerns, and asked for the games to be shifted to co-host Sri Lanka.The T20 World Cup is set to begin on February 7.

As a League Commissioner and administrator, what markers do you look at to evaluate success.



Do you think the SA20 now needs more teams from next season?

How much impact does SA20 have on the social critical scenario of South Africa as a community builder?



Do you see SA20 has come to a stage where it is changing the lives of cricketers who are coming from backgrounds where they did not have money to play cricket. Now they are in, you know, SA20 playing. Say someone like Mokoena who was spotted.

Former cricketer Sourav Ganguly at an event, in Kolkata, West Bengal.

Keeping the game and the league clean. Has that been a big area of attention?



Poll What do you think is the most significant factor in the commercial success of the SA20 league this season? Increased ticket sales High quality of cricket Support from IPL franchises Strong viewership growth

Do you see on the horizon where an exhibition match or two, three matches, like women's SA20 getting started some way?



: SA20 is in the middle of its fourth edition and the league commercially is having its best edition till date. The stadiums are full, investors are happy and the league is growing from strength to strength with every match. With hundreds, hat-tricks, Super Over and tight contests, quality of cricket has been right up there and League Commissioner Graeme Smith is very happy to see the progress. In an interaction on the sidelines of a fixture in Durban, the former South Africa captain opens up on the commercial success, support of IPL franchises, role of Cricket South Africa and more.I think firstly, we've seen growth in the first two weeks. Viewership, crowd attendance, atmosphere, and cricket has been good. So I think that was really exciting. Unfortunately, you can't always predict these things, and when these unseasonal types of fronts come through certain parts of South Africa, it's a challenge, especially when you've got a game a day and you're moving around the country. But I think right now we've just got to stay positive. There's a lot of cricket still left to be played. We're only halfway really in the season.And the tension and the atmosphere, and I can just feel in the mind of people that are talking, wanting to come to games.Even one or two washed out games, watching how the crowds haven't left, it shows you that the product I think has really stepped up another level this year.I don't know if I like the word administrator, but, you know, I mean, obviously we're always following metrics. I think for us, ticketing is a big one. So we've seen a big increase in ticketing. I think we've four more sold-out games already than we were at the same point last year. Over 27 or 28% increase in ticketing in the first half of the season. Viewership is up in India, viewership is up here.Digital growth is up. The other metrics that's important for me is always got to be the cricket. The pitches have been slightly better on a consistent level than they were last year. We've seen closer games, super overs, hundreds, hat-tricks, and, a number of last over finishes. For me the quality of cricket has been excellent this year. I'm hoping that over the next two weeks we'll really see the same or even get better.I don't know if it requires it. The decision's got to be that it's got to add value. Outside IPL, we've seen other leagues get bigger and struggle, over longer periods. We also work very closely with Cricket South Africa on the future tours programmes and making sure that there's enough international cricket happening around the SA20. There's definitely interest in being a part of the league.That's not the issue. The issue is just what is right for the league going forward and when is the right time to add more teams. After the 27 World Cup, you know, the FTP, then it's a little bit easier to work with. There's more, space to work and manoeuvre if you want to grow the number of games, extend the league by another 20 games. You need another two, three weeks or whatever it is. I think post 2027 27, in the new cycle, we'll work with Cricket South Africa and see what's the best way forward.Look, that's always the case. There's always, in the southern hemisphere, a lot of cricket on the go. Just look at India now. Women's Premier League starts and there's an Indian vs New Zealand series. We've been up against the Ashes and all that sort of stuff. I think the one thing about being here since the beginning is we've always built that way.We've never had a clean window. We've always had to build up against ILT20 or against, a busy southern hemisphere. And I think we've proven to be successful in that climate. You know, so our brains don't work like that. Our brains are focused on, like, developing the best product. Making sure that people enjoy it, that cricket's competitive, that the fans are filling the stadiums and having a great time.And hopefully we get some great sunshine in the next two weeks to really help with that momentum. I think the game every day and close games, we see, when we have two or three good games close together, how you can feel the tension shift and change. And, hopefully we'll get that run of games now.Well, I mean, we have obviously our social partners like Laureus where we're investing in communities. I think the most important thing is that we're also delivering money back to Cricket South Africa, which flows into growing the game. We, as SA20, have invested in our own development programmes as well. So we have SA20 schools, which is girls and boys in our over 700 schools.And then from an economy perspective, last year we brought over R4 billion to the economy, created 8,500 jobs. So those are some really great metrics in a very young product. You know, we're delivering almost a world event every year in this country. From that perspective, I think being just around four years old now, I think we've done some amazing work around the social aspect of South Africa.I mean, it's great. I actually watched his interview last night. Just listening to him, his first experience bowling at the Wanderers in a high-pressure game, and he's done extremely well. He's been throwing the ball in some of the most high-pressure moments as a young man. It's great to see him coming through last year. I think credit to our franchises that have really got behind the youth programme that we've tried. The rookies have started now in the U23. I think IPL franchises are good at attracting youth and backing them.I think we've seen that in India. We see it here as well. And, you know, a lot more players are getting an opportunity to be recognised on a global stage. I was looking at it the other day. Over 10 years, you know, the player salaries will probably be close to a billion rand, if you take it over the 10-year period. And that's a huge, huge uplift in South African cricket ecosystem for players. I think now as a youngster coming through, the cricket dream or from a job perspective, it's looking highly strong for youngsters that want to make it or play.We've been pretty consistent in our window. I think this year is an anomaly. We normally, every year we start at January 9 and 10 after the New Year's Test match and we run for those couple of weeks after that. This year because of South Africa being in India up until the 20th of December and the World Cup in February and there wasn't any international cricket in the window.So, it made sense for us to start slightly earlier. But outside that, our window will generally always be the same, depending on when the New Year's Test match starts and run for a couple of weeks after that. In terms of plugs, I think for us, what we've realised is a lot of what we've done has been really good and it's about making sure we hit those same markers every year. Obviously, they're improving. I think we would love to see the pool of South African players get bigger.So, now we're starting to see across the six teams that the South African group of players are getting really strong. If you want to start adding more teams and stuff into the future, you need to start looking at another 20, 25 high-quality players that make sure when we add new franchises that there's enough depth to make sure that the league remains equally competitive.And then, you know, for us, commercially, we're having our strongest year. You know, we're seeing corporate South Africa get behind us. Global broadcasters as well. So, I think it's about now just making sure you go from strength to strength.I think having six IPL franchises for us has been amazing. I know not every other league has all IPL, but for us it's been amazing because they're equally competitive, they want to win, they invest in players. They're highly driven to be successful. I think they've also had the patience to learn. So, when they move into a new region, they've had to learn about South Africa, learn about ticketing, hospitality, the way fans operate, you know, the culture as well.But they've brought excellence to South African cricket, and that has been a huge asset. They bring excellence to the table and they push you. And that helps everyone get better.Obviously these things, not being in a clean window, are always FTP-related. You know, like Ben Stokes was under contract, but the Ashes is happening, he doesn't come back, he gets replaced. And a poor owner, right. So, I think what you want is for those top players in your window to, if they're not playing international cricket, to want to be here.And I think that's the message we're getting back from them. That they really love coming here, it's highly competitive cricket. Obviously, it's a great place to be over the summer, and there's crowds, and it's fun. Hopefully, also credit to the franchises. I think they play a huge role in attracting the international talent as well.No, we hope to get more and more, you know. There's some great friends that we have in India. And like I say, we've worked closely with the BCCI as well.They've been really supportive in helping us make some key decisions over the years in terms of building the product. But, you know, to have Dada, you know, is a highlight. And I know, having chatted to him a number of times through the year, how seriously he's taking this, and he wants to do well.He's a competitive man. With the Capitals franchise, he has a big influential role. Now, coaching, so he's put himself in the hot seat. I hope the rest of the season goes well for him. It's been a huge asset to have people like him, Kumar Sangakkara Stephen Fleming come out here for our players and also for the status of the league.You can't control everything. We do invest a lot of money in making sure that our anti-corruption units are strong, working with the ICC, best practise. We've had a very strong anti-corruption team here. We educate players on everything... We've seen a strong influence in the drug-free sport.We've seen anti-corruption. So we do all the educational stuff pre-tournament, constantly follow up on it. Make sure there's good policing units around. And you're right. It is a risk to your league. So that's why we spend a lot of money making sure that we're doing everything we can to protect the integrity of the game.I do. I really do. I've said over the last few years, Cricket South Africa started a domestic women's programme, I think it was two years ago. We've invested in the schools and, you know, trying to grow the depth of the women's game here. You know, I think how it starts, I'm not sure yet. I think that'll be a bit, you know, the Cricket South Africa CEO has come out and said that it's time now. So, I think post this tournament, we will all sit down and figure out what that step looks like. But absolutely, it will be one of the major discussions post season four.",SA20 League Commissioner Graeme Smith talks to Sportsmail about the new season. SA20 is in the middle of its fourth edition and the league commercially is having its best edition till date. The league is growing from strength to strength with every match. The stadiums are happy and the investors are happy.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126445985,imgsize-37036,width-400,resizemode-4/graeme-smith.jpg"
