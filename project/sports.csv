Taylor Swift Wants A Private “White Wedding” Which Will Be Away From The Media



Travis Kelce Finds It “Overwhelming” How Much Their Fans Speculate About An Engagement



As Taylor Swift celebrated her 35th birthday party in an Eras-themed birthday celebration, many fans speculated if she and Travis Kelce were already engaged. As per Daily Mail, a source close to the couple has denied such rumours but has also given an interesting detail about the kind of wedding Taylor wants. Taylor wants a very traditional “white wedding” very much away from the public eye.This is very evident since neither Taylor nor Travis is very open about their relationship in public. They might be spotted outside hanging out or on date nights but they never reveal too much about their relationship in public forums. As per Daily Mail, the source has revealed that even their closest friends want fans to calm down so that the couple can enjoy their relationship. The source also highlighted that an engagement is something both Taylor and her boyfriend, the NFL star and the Kansas City Chiefs tight end, Travis Kelce are looking forward to but this is not the right time for it. They are deeply in love with one another and want to enjoy their relationship. Contrary to public opinion, apparently both Taylor and Travis find it very funny that fans have spread stories about them being engaged since the beginning of their relationship and there is literally no truth to it.Travis also finds it “overwhelming” due to the number of stories people make about their engagement and future plans. Every time there has been a big event in either Taylor or Travis’ careers, there have been stories about an engagement taking place. Though neither Travis nor Taylor have issued any public statements about it but as per Daily Mail, the source close to the couple has revealed that they know the stories being circulated about them but they tend to not react to them.The source has also revealed that Travis already has few ideas about their engagement and wants it to be a memorable day for Taylor so he will not leave any stone unturned to make it possibly the best day in Taylor’s life but he will not go public with his plans. Both Taylor and Travis like to maintain privacy about their relationship and they will not be going public with anything until it has been finalised.Also Read: Taylor Swift attends Travis Kelce's game in a luxurious long red coat, joined by her parents at Arrowhead Stadium Currently, Taylor and Travis are experiencing one of the happiest and most successful years of their lives.

""What a boy God has gifted me"" - mother Padma Kumari on Gukesh winning World Championship 2024

NEW DELHI: 18-year-old D Gukesh rewrote history by becoming the youngest World Chess Champion , dethroning China’s Ding Liren in a nerve-wracking 14-game series in Singapore.His triumph stirred waves of admiration across the globe, not just for the sheer brilliance of his gameplay but also for the unique sacrifices that shaped his meteoric rise.Central to his extraordinary journey is his mother, Padma Kumari , who candidly shared the behind-the-scenes struggles and decisions made by the family.One of the most pivotal and unconventional choices was withdrawing Gukesh from formal schooling after the 4th or 5th grade.In an interview with ChessBase India, Padma revealed, ""There are many critical moments when we doubted ourselves. I don't know how to say it exactly. Whenever he didn’t play well, we used to wonder whether we had made the right decision for him. He was very young, and it was our responsibility to make decisions for him. You know, he didn’t go to school after fourth or fifth grade.”This decision, while unconventional in the contemporary Indian setting, enabled Gukesh to focus entirely on his passion for the game.""So, in India -- or anywhere -- it’s a big decision. For any child, not studying is risky. It was a risk-taking moment, deciding whether it was appropriate to stop his studies and put him fully into chess,"" she added.""Whenever he achieved something or his rating improved, we felt happy, like we were on the right path. But as parents, whenever he didn’t do well in a tournament, we doubted ourselves—not Gukesh, but our decision. This happened many times, especially during his younger days. But as he matured, we could see how disciplined and hardworking he was. That gave us confidence. We knew he would definitely come up.""Despite the scepticism and challenges, Padma emphasized her unwavering belief in her son’s talent and hard work, coupled with a deep trust in God.“Not sending him to school was such a tough call, and even now, many people say we took a risk. You know, choosing a different path—keeping him out of school and putting him fully into chess—came with so much uncertainty. Initially, we thought we’d wait till 8th grade and then decide. But even after 9th grade, we saw him showing improvement, so we kept going. By God’s grace, everything went well,” Padma recounted.""This (seeing Gukesh become the world chess champion) is the first time I feel we made the correct decision. He wouldn’t have been able to balance both school and chess. When you focus entirely on one thing—your passion—you can definitely shine.""","18-year-old D Gukesh rewrote history by becoming the youngest World Chess Champion.

Rohit Sharma hit on knee during nets session at MCG

MELBOURNE: Rohit Sharma was hit on his left knee while facing throwdown specialist Daya during India’s second training session at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Sunday. Rohit did continue for a bit but decided to receive attention from the team physiotherapist.The Indian captain removed his gear, settled into a chair and the physio got the ice pack out. There was pain visible on the right-hander’s face when the pack was put on, and the physio later placed the left leg on a chair to get Rohit into a comfortable position.The blow didn’t look that serious, and the physio is taking precaution to ensure swelling, if any, subsides. There is still some time left for the Boxing Day Test to begin and Rohit would hope the pain goes away.Akash Deep confirmed in a press conference on the sidelines that the injury was not serious. ""Such blows are common when you play cricket. I think this wicket was for white ball which is why the ball was staying low. But these blows are common.""The entire Indian team was in attendance and the session saw Jasprit Bumrah operate at full tilt against the Indian batters.The seamer was breathing fire in the nets and troubled the regular batters with sharp angles. Even Mohammed Siraj and Akash Deep looked in good rhythm as they bowled a very long spell to the Indian top-order with the new ball.Virat Kohli was also present but he chose to face a lot of side—armers and then spinners Washington Sundar and Ravindra Jadeja.The players kept shuffling nets and attacks during the session, which lasted well over two hours.The Indian team will have a rest day tomorrow (Monday).The fourth Test of the Border Gavaskar Trophy begins on December 26.

However, the road narrows drastically if India falter:

Loss of Series (1-2 or Worse): India’s chances vanish completely.

NEW DELHI: Team India superstar Virat Kohli on Friday turned heads on social media with his latest hairdo, just days before the Boxing Day Test which starts from December 26 in Melbourne.After the drawn Test in Brisbane, the Indian team recently arrived in Melbourne and the new Kohli haircut on Friday created an instant buzz on the internet.The stylistic transformation was shared on X (formally Twitter), garnering admiration from fans.With Kohli’s dynamic personality extending beyond cricket , his fresh look has further fueled anticipation for the upcoming contest.WatchAfter an underwhelming series performance—aside from his stunning century in the first Test’s second innings—he is expected to reclaim his peak form for the remainder of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy .As the series stands at 1-1, India must overcome challenges on both ends of the pitch to keep their hopes alive for the 2025 ICC World Test Championship (WTC) Final.A draw in the Gabba Test earlier this week—heavily affected by rain—kept the teams tied, intensifying the upcoming contests at Melbourne and Sydney.While Kohli prepares to bolster the team’s middle order, India must rectify glaring issues, including an inconsistent top-order performance and over-reliance on Jasprit Bumrah’s bowling heroics.A robust Australian pace attack and unforgiving pitch conditions make the next two Tests critical.India currently sit third in the WTC standings. Securing wins in both remaining Tests would propel them to 60.53% in percentage points, securing a spot in the final regardless of other results.For now, Kohli’s refreshed mindset and appearance symbolize Team India’s readiness to fight as they aim for victory on one of cricket’s grandest stages.","Virat Kohli gets a new hairdo ahead of Boxing Day Test in Melbourne.

This isn't his first public frustration; after the previous loss to Minnesota, Brisker urged the team to “Got to tighten up. Not supposed to go like that.” But today’s message is sharper. He’s had enough. (via: EssentiallySports)The Chicago Bears have now endured back-to-back losses to the Minnesota Vikings, and the void left by Jaquan Brisker’s absence on the field is impossible to ignore. Known for his fiery leadership and unrelenting defensive prowess, Brisker’s candid social media posts are a window into his frustration and a stark reminder of just how much his presence is missed by both the defense and the entire team. Without his energy and drive, the Bears seem to lack the spark they desperately need to turn things around.Meanwhile, tight end Cole Kmet has made it clear he’s steering clear of the blame game. There’s no direct finger-pointing, but his unmistakable frustration with the offensive line’s struggles under Caleb Williams speaks volumes. His reserved yet pointed comments suggest deeper issues within the team’s offensive mechanics that must be addressed to regain their footing.Also Read: Maxx Crosby addresses rumors with personal statement after cryptic post linked to Shedeur Sanders' Raiders buzz Cole Kmet didn’t hold back after Monday’s disaster, visibly frustrated by the team’s lack of execution. “You’ve gotta take care of your own s— and just do your job,” Kmet said, his tone reflecting the frustration of a player fed up with repeated failures. With just one target in the game, his anger is justified—once a reliable option in the offense, Kmet is now being sidelined, often ignored entirely in critical moments.DJ Moore also voiced his concerns, questioning whether it’s effort, execution, or a mix of both that’s holding the team back. Meanwhile, Caleb Williams is under relentless pressure, tied for the most sacks taken this season at a staggering 58. NFL legend Troy Aikman even described him as a “defeated guy,” drawing parallels to his own grueling rookie struggles. While Williams hasn’t thrown an interception in eight games, his two fumbles in the last two weeks spotlight deeper cracks in the offense. An unsteady offensive line has left him exposed, with little time to recover in the pocket.With three games left, Williams is on pace to land second on the list for most sacks taken by a rookie, trailing only Bryce Young and David Carr.

NEW DELHI: Indian batting sensation Vaibhav Suryavanshi is on a record-breaking streak. After making history last month as the youngest-ever player to be sold at the IPL auction, where he was bought by Rajasthan Royals for Rs 1.1 crore, Suryavanshi has now become the youngest-ever Indian player to feature in a List A game.The left-handed batter achieved the milestone during Bihar's opening match of the Vijay Hazare Trophy against Madhya Pradesh on Saturday.At just 13 years and 269 days old, Suryavanshi shattered the previous record held by Ali Akbar , who made his List A debut for Vidarbha at the age of 14 years and 51 days during the 1999/2000 season.Suryavanshi also holds the records for being the youngest Indian to play in the Ranji Trophy and to represent India at the U19 level.Suryavanshi, however, had a disappointing start to his List A career, being dismissed for just four runs. Madhya Pradesh pacer Avesh Khan took three wickets, helping his team to bowl out Bihar for 196.MP then rode on an unbeaten 55 by skipper Rajat Patidar and an 83 by opener Harsh Gawali to go past the target in just 25.1 overs for a six-wicket win.Suryavanshi said that he is more excited about the opportunity to be coached by the legendary Rahul Dravid at Rajasthan Royals than the prospect of becoming the youngest-ever player in the IPL.""I am really glad that I am getting a chance to play in the IPL.

Why R Ashwin retirement was a last minute surprise for Ravindra Jadeja

What’s inside Virat Kohli’s kit bag?

'Top order should get more runs'

MELBOURNE: In one sudden move, a citadel lies in ruins. The Ravindra Jadeja-Ravichandran Ashwin combine, one of the game's greatest ever spin-bowling pairs, has met an untidy end with Ashwin's abrupt retirement.If the end of their era deserved a more sentimental flourish, Ravindra Jadeja was having none of it on Saturday as the Indian team hit the nets here at the MCG.""Move on toh hona hi padega (one must move on),"" Jadeja said. ""Hopefully, Indian cricket will get a good spinner and allrounder in Ashwin's place. In India, aisa to hai nehi ki koi uski jagah nehi le sakta (it's not as if there's nobody to replace Ashwin).""Whoever goes, we get some replacement or the other. It's also good for the youngsters. Whichever youngster replaces him will get a good opportunity to prove himself at this level,"" he added.Jadeja isn't someone to wax philosophical, and his pragmatic approach to what he termed an unexpected move from Ashwin is probably best for the team heading into the crucial fourth Test.""I got to know at the last moment (about the retirement), just five minutes before he came for the press conference. Someone informed me. The whole day we were sitting together, and he didn't even give me a hint. Ashwin ko to sab jante hi hai, uska dimaag kaisa hai (everyone knows he's a bit quirky),"" Jadeja said with a smile.The pair, which came together in Dec 2012 in Nagpur against England, formed the impenetrable core of India's home domination for over a decade. In tandem, they bowled in 58 Tests, 49 of them at home, and earned a 71.42 home win percentage, with only six losses.Ashwin was the shape shifter, possessing the rare skill to constantly remake himself. Jadeja could bend steel with relentless accuracy.They are both very different personalities but fed off each other's strengths, improving their career averages when they bowled together. Away from home, though, they were often competitors for the lone spinner's slot.""Obviously he was like an on-field mentor,"" Jadeja said. ""As a bowling partner for so many years, we kept passing messages to each other. What the situation of the match is, what shots the batters are looking to play, how best to plan as a pair. All these things I will miss very much.""The end of their hunt marks a line in the sand for spin bowling in general, and probably ends, for now, India's long tradition of spinners hunting in pairs. Jadeja, however, said the absence of Ashwin wouldn't have an immediate impact on him.Spinners have taken only seven wickets compared to 86 by the pacers in the three Tests played in this series so far, and Jadeja said his role as a support act to the pacers wasn't about to change either at the MCG.""My mindset won't change with Ashwin's departure. Every match situation is different and that dictates the mindset in a particular game,"" Jadeja said.Will there be more responsibility, now that Ashwin is gone?""In India when we play, the spinners have a greater role to play. Here, it's only a supporting role because the wickets don't offer much help,"" he said.""One has to bowl a good line and length, decide the field accordingly and keep bowling in that manner. In Australia, I don't think there will be talk of greater responsibility on me. From the last Test to this one, I don't think my role will change. But yes, definitely when we play in India, there will be greater responsibility.""After making Jadeja sit out of the first two Tests, India found out in Brisbane just how crucial his presence is in the XI. While he was a bit flat with the ball in unfriendly conditions, Jadeja rescued India with a well-made 77, putting on 67 vital runs with KL Rahul.The knock eventually enabled India to avoid the follow on and save the rain-affected Test.Jadeja, as usual, made light of his omission. ""It just gave me more time to work hard in the nets,"" he said. ""It's satisfying to score runs outside India, especially when the team is in trouble. It has also boosted my confidence. I'll try to maintain the rhythm and momentum in the coming games.""Jadeja was also unequivocal in stating that the team needs a larger contribution from the top and middle order. ""Even if we win one (of the remaining two Tests), we can retain the trophy. When you play outside India, especially in places like Australia and South Africa, it becomes important for the toporder to score runs.""If they cannot contribute in these conditions, definitely there is more pressure on the middle and lower-middle order. As a team we need the top-order to perform. That said, as a batting unit if everyone contributes, the team will do well.""Even if the script doesn't go India's way eventually, Jadeja has already spied the positives. ""The youngsters need to get more experience in these conditions,"" he said.",Ravindra Jadeja says no one is irreplaceable after R Ashwin's retirement.

Myles Garrett’s strong message to the struggling Browns

Myles Garrett , the Defensive Player of the Year , may leave the Cleveland Browns if their plans for the future do not align with his goals. Prior to Cleveland's Week 16 AFC North match against the Cincinnati Bengals, ahead of which Cleveland (3-11) has already been eliminated from the playoffs, which does not coincide with his experience of getting into the playoffs twice, Garrett spoke about his future.Cleveland's Myles Garrett has shown indifference to the team's chance for another dramatic offseason, claiming that he will be seeing the plans the owners and decision-makers are going to make, for he is in the last weeks of a disappointing double-digit loss season.""Well, for me, I mean first of all I want to win. I want the Browns to be able to put me and us in position to win,"" Garrett said, via Cleveland.com. ""I'm not trying to rebuild. I'm trying to win right now. I want that to be apparent, when the season's over and we have those discussions, I want them to be able to illuminate that for me, illustrate that for me, so that can be something that I can see in the near future. Because that's all we want to do.”Garrett, despite his happiness in Cleveland, is not satisfied with the current situation and suggests that a change of scenery might be necessary at some point in his career.

""But we have to do, at the end of the day, what’s best for us. So, if we have that alignment where this is something that is still possible in the near future — winning, going deep in the playoffs, putting a great defense out there ... I think that would really keep my mind at rest and keep me settled.”Garrett, signed through 2026, expressed openness about his potential to play elsewhere if the team's future plans do not align with his. ""I mean, it's a possibility, but I want to be a Cleveland Brown,"" he said. ""I want to play here, play my career here.

Akash Deep on his battle with Steve Smith, plans for Travis Head

NEW DELHI: India's pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah is rewriting the record books in the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy , delivering performances that have left cricket experts and fans in awe. Former India wicketkeeper-batter Dinesh Karthik has heaped praise on the pacer, calling him a ""freak of nature"" and likening him to a priceless ""Kohinoor diamond"" that must be protected.Speaking on Cricbuzz, Karthik said, ""He is a freak of nature. I used this term before, and I am not shy of using it again. He is that 'kohinoor' diamond that we need to protect every day. What he does out there is special. There is no bowler that can do what he is doing in the world today across formats.""Bumrah's exploits have indeed been extraordinary. He leads the wicket-takers list in the series with 21 dismissals in three Tests at a jaw-dropping average of 10.90. His relentless accuracy and ability to trouble Australian batters have been pivotal in keeping India in the contest. After his heroics in Brisbane, Bumrah became the most successful Indian bowler in Australia, with 53 wickets in 10 Tests at an average of 17.15, surpassing Kapil Dev's tally of 51 wickets in 11 matches.Karthik also highlighted Bumrah's calm demeanor and strong resolve, which extend to his approach to batting. ""His staunch ability and resolve come through his batting as well. I've seen him bat, obviously, it's something he is always working on so he can contribute. For me, it's his character. You speak to him - very simple, very calm, very self-confident. And his aggression comes through the way he bowls, not through what he says,"" Karthik remarked.The former cricketer concluded by calling Bumrah ""one of the greatest fast bowlers India has produced without a shadow of doubt"" and described him as an ""absolute legend in every sense already with the ball.""With the fourth Test set to begin at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on December 26, all eyes will be on Bumrah as he continues to script history and lead India's charge against Australia.","Jasprit Bumrah is rewriting the record books in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.

NEW DELHI: The series is currently tied at 1-1, and Team India will look to come out all guns blazing as they aim to take the lead against Australia in the fourth Test match at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, starting December 26. India previously secured back-to-back series wins in Australia, first under Virat Kohli 's leadership in 2018-19 and then with Ajinkya Rahane at the helm in 2020-21. Now, with Rohit Sharma as captain, Team India is eyeing an unprecedented third straight triumph Down Under.On being asked about the team’s plans, India pacer Akash Deep said: ""Jo plan hai wo nahi bata sakte, wo bhi tayyar ho jayenge (We can’t reveal our plans, as they’ll prepare accordingly).""""As fast bowlers, we will stick to the same deliveries and maintain discipline in our bowling. We will bowl from both over and around the wicket, assess the pitch and conditions, and plan accordingly,"" Akash Deep added while addressing reporters at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Sunday ahead of the Boxing Day Test .""I think Travis Head, in particular, struggles against short balls. We won’t let him settle at the crease. We’ll target specific areas and hope to force him into mistakes, which will create chances for us,"" he stated.Akash Deep, who has played just one Test on the tour in Brisbane and claimed three wickets in the match, reflected on the challenges of bowling in Australian conditions.""It is a bit difficult. I have played most of my cricket in India. We can bowl shorter lengths there, but here it is a bit of a challenge,"" he explained.""Sometimes you think you are bowling really well. Jo bhi wicket ya condition ho, as a fast bowler discipline mein rehna kaafi important hota hai (Whatever the conditions or wickets are, as a fast bowler, you need to maintain discipline),"" Akash Deep added.India began the Border-Gavaskar Trophy series in style with a commanding 295-run win over Australia in Perth but suffered a 10-wicket defeat in the day-night Test in Adelaide. The third Test at the Gabba in Brisbane ended in a draw, setting the stage for a decisive showdown in Melbourne.","Team India will look to take the lead against Australia in the fourth Test match at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, starting December 26.

Patrick Mahomes’ Kids Spend A Perfect Christmas Celebration



Fans Divided As Patrick Mahomes Walked Into The Field Without Any Sign Of Injuries



NFL star Patrick Mahomes and his wife Brittany Mahomes are currently busy preparing for Christmas celebrations. While Patrick will be busy on Christmas day as he will be playing against the Pittsburgh Steelers, his pregnant wife is leaving no stone unturned to make this Christmas for their two kids. Brittany recently shared some snippets from an early Christmas celebration that featured their kids dressed in red jumpsuits and having the time of their lives.The first image that Brittany posted showed her son holding a Christmas gift while other pictures that Brittany posted showed her posing with her children. The pictures also featured some friends of Patrick and Brittany’s kids as they all looked excited to welcome Christmas together.In one of the images, Brittany is sitting with her kids, looking at them and it’s a beautiful reminder of what it feels like to be with family as they are welcoming the Christmas season. Brittany is also currently pregnant with their third and the family is set to welcome another daughter into the family in the next few months.In the pictures posted by Brittany, Patrick seems to be missing from all of them. One can assume this is probably because Patrick was busy tending to his ankle injury and preparing for today’s game at the Arrowhead Stadium as Patrick’s team, the Kansas City Chiefs are set to go against the Houston Texans .The last week has been a bit tough on the Mahomes family as the NFL star and the quarterback of the Kansas City Chiefs, Patrick had sustained an injury on his ankle when the Chiefs were playing against the Cleveland Browns. However, it did not affect the game and the Kansas City Chiefs secured another win after defeating the Cleveland Browns.Patrick spoke to the media after his team won the match and assured them he would be back on the field next week and also highlighted how he is used to such ankle injuries. The last time Patrick had sustained such an injury was back in January of 2023. Today, a video of him went viral when Patrick was seen walking into the Arrowhead Stadium smoothly, with no signs of injuries. This video had fans divided as many questioned the authenticity of his injury last week. Many fans have assumed that Patrick has been constantly “faking” injuries and this is just another act of his.Also Read: $10 million down the drain: Jeremy Fowler slams Diontae Johnson for refusing to play against the Eagles However, Patrick never said that his injury was too painful.

Why R Ashwin retirement was a last minute surprise for Ravindra Jadeja

Rohit Sharma nets session: Indian skipper prepares for Boxing Day Test

MELBOURNE: Australian media stooped to a new low today at the Melbourne Cricket Ground ( MCG ) as they accused Ravindra Jadeja of not answering the questions in English at an interaction. This comes at a time when Cricket Australia is yet to respond to TimesofIndia.com's request for an interview with Usman Khawaja in Hindi, a language he is very fluent and comfortable with.Arranged by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) for travelling media, around a dozen Indian journalists gathered at the MCG today to speak to Jadeja after his practice and gym session. Not invited, some Australian media outlets, without the accreditation, decided to turn up at the event but they were still accommodated by the Indian cricket board's media team.All questions fired to Jadeja during the nearly 10-minute interaction were in Hindi and the all-rounder responded in the same language. The BCCI media manager continued to take questions and even lined up an Australian journalist but the team bus was about to leave and most Indian journalists, lined up, were not able to ask the question. The handful of local journalists decided to lose their cool at BCCI media manager and even directed a cameraman, stationed in the stands, to continue recording the entire conversation.The entire conversation, which the BCCI media manager termed as ""private"" and even asked the cameraman to stop filming, was later aired on Australian channels. Not a long time back, the same set of channels did the same when Virat Kohli requested for privacy for his kids at the airport but the conversation was spun into a fiery exchange.Still not clear whether the journalists today were irked by no question or no response in English. If it was the latter, they could have well used a translation software to get their quotes in the language of their preference. They instead chose to spin a needless controversy.It now remains to be seen whether Cricket Australia agrees to our request for an interview with Khawaja in Hindi. The story will be updated moment we hear from the communications wing of the Australian cricket board.",All questions fired to Jadeja during the nearly 10-minute interaction were in Hindi and the all-rounder responded in the same language.

NEW DELHI: UAE emerged victorious by just two runs in a nail-biting contest against Kuwait to claim their maiden ILT20 Gulf Cricket Championship title at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Saturday.The closely contested final kept the fans on edge until the very last over as UAE defended 153 against a spirited Kuwait side.Opting to bat first, UAE began cautiously as openers Muhammad Waseem and Tanish Suri struggled to find momentum. Waseem fell early for 1, but Alishan Sharafu’s 28 off 17 balls, laced with three 4s and two 6s, provided the much-needed impetus.Contributions from Tanish Suri (34 off 32) and Rahul Chopra (28 off 17) steadied the innings as the run rate gradually climbed.However, Kuwait’s bowlers struck back at crucial moments. Yasin Patel and Sayed Monib were the standouts, claiming three wickets apiece, supported by Meet Bhavsar ’s economical spell of 2/16.In response, Kuwait endured an early collapse, losing two wickets within the opening two overs, courtesy of Junaid Siddique (1/42) and Dhruv Parashar (1/26).Bhavsar, the only hope for Kuwait in the decisive hours, steadied the innings with a valiant 72 off 54, including six 4s and three 6s.Despite losing partners regularly, Bhavsar, along with Yasin Patel (15 not out off 8), brought Kuwait tantalisingly close with a flurry of boundaries.Patel’s big hits off consecutive deliveries in the penultimate over reduced the equation to 8 runs off the final over.The last over, bowled by Muhammad Jawadullah , was a spectacle of cricketing drama.A wide ball followed by a boundary from Bhavsar set Kuwait within striking distance. However, Jawadullah kept his composure, dismissing Bhavsar as the batter fell for a slower delivery and ended up giving away an easy catch to Nilansh Keswani.With three runs needed from four balls, Jawadullah bowled Mohamed Shafeeq off his very first delivery, sealing UAE's historic two-run victory.While Meet Bhavsar’s heroic knock earned widespread admiration, he could not take Kuwait over the line when it mattered the most. On the other hand, Jawadullah (2/28) was instrumental in a nerve-wracking final sequence.The victory thus not only crowned UAE champions but also left their growing prominence in the Gulf cricketing arena, capping a tournament filled with excitement and high-quality cricket.",UAE claim maiden ILT20 Gulf Cricket Championship title.

Why R Ashwin retirement was a last minute surprise for Ravindra Jadeja

NEW DELHI: Travis Head has been the only Australian batter to consistently defy the Indian bowlers in the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy . This isn't the first time his batting has troubled India, he also played pivotal roles in their defeats during the ICC World Test Championship final and the ODI World Cup final last year.After a modest start with a dismissal for just 11 in his first innings of the series, Head bounced back brilliantly, scoring 89, 140, and 152 in his next three innings.Considering Head's form, former India coach Ravi Shastri humorously gave him a new nickname.""Because his new surname is Travis Head'ache',"" Shastri said on the most recent episode of The ICC Review.""They are looking for balms in India. For foot problems, ankle problems (and) even a headache they are looking for a balm. He is ideal for that.""Shastri highlighted the batter's improved short-ball technique as a key factor in his success.""I think he is very smart. From what I saw of him three years ago, he has improved immensely. Especially with the way he plays the short ball. He prepared to leave it. He has learned to leave it well at times.""""It's not a big shot all the time off a short delivery angled at his armpits or something. He's prepared to either ride it or go for the big shots. And if it is middle, middle and off, then he hits it in front of square as well.""""He picks up length very well. That's one of his great strengths. And he has a flashing blade for the offside. So he's a hard man to contain. And he's in the form of his life,"" Shastri said.Although Head has been dismissed by India's fast-bowling spearhead Jasprit Bumrah , he has also managed to score 83 off 91 balls while facing him. Shastri recalled a particular shot from Head against Bumrah early in one of his innings, which made him realise that the left-handed batter was in exceptional form.""We all knew he was dangerous, but that first shot he played off Jasprit Bumrah, that cover drive, off the front foot. It was in many ways a little bit on the up, off a good delivery, decent delivery. It told me that this is a player in prime, prime form.""""He went on to show exactly that. And the thing with him is there's no, his mindset is very clear. There's no clouded mindset. He's very clear about the situation. This is my strength. I am going to play in that fashion. Yes, I will watch the state of the game. I might shift from fourth gear to third gear. But I will always be in third and fourth gear once I get my eye on.""The ongoing five-match Border-Gavaskar Trophy series is currently locked at 1-1. Australia and India will play the fourth game, which is the Boxing Day Test, at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on December 26.","Travis Head has been the only Australian batter to consistently defy the Indian bowlers in the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy series.

Marketplaces buzzing

MELBOURNE: ""You see that blue stand over there, they are the most notorious lot. Expect a lot of noise and distraction coming from there,"" says the lone security guard manning the boundary rope on a day where only public tours of the Melbourne Cricket Ground were happening.He was pointing towards the six blocks of seating near the Shane Warne End when he cautioned about the madness which is expected to unfold on opening day of the Boxing Day Test between India and Australia on December 26. Close to 1,00,000 people are expected to be in the stands for the sold-out day and the security team has beefed up the man power for the most sought-after cricket fixture of the Australian home summer.For a regular game, there are only 10 security guards near the ropes but the count will swell to 14-15 from coming Thursday. Every block generally has 15 security guards who switch duties between the gates and stands but that count has increased to 20. Ten guards would now be stationed on the gates of every block while 10 will be in the stands to ensure there is order for what promises to be a loud morning.""They just come and drink. That loud bunch in those blue blocks. Beer just flows and expect the beer glass towers to get taller as the game progresses. There would be some who would even be chucked out of the venue for creating ruckus, we are prepared for that. It's sad they don't want to enjoy cricket and then end up losing money which was spent on tickets,"" adds the guard.He wasn't there when Virat Kohli hit that memorable six off Harris Raufin the 2022 T20 World Cup fixture versus Pakistan but says, with a lot of conviction, even that can't match the madness which happens during a Australian Football League fixture at the venue.""I know people are crazy about cricket but madness is unreal during a AFL game here. It even gets violent between fans during the game and I am sure this Boxing Day cricket match will not be that,"" he explains with a chuckle.With the tickets sold out, different marketplaces are abuzz with resellers looking to make a quick buck on the resale of tickets. The premium is not as steep as it was for the India-Pakistan game back in 2022 but the sellers are comfortably making over 50 AUD on every ticket.There are multiple groups on Facebook which have a lot of members from the Asian community and they are happy to shell out the extra dollars to watch the game from the stands.""A ticket which was say for 30 AUD is now easily selling at 80 or even 100 AUD. Recently some tickets were released again and they were for over 150 AUD. Within no time they were sold out too. It's proper madness for this game,"" says a part-time cab driver who works in a IT firm as a software developer.The festivities have already begun in Melbourne, well before the Test, and are expected to continue till the New Year. For the security personnel, however, there will be very little breather because someone has to maintain order in the madness which is expected to hit the MCG","1,00,000 people are expected to be in the stands for the sold-out day.

Why R Ashwin retirement was a last minute surprise for Ravindra Jadeja

Stadium Walkthrough series: Inside The Gabba

Former Australian cricketer Michael Hussey has shared his memories of encountering a young Jasprit Bumrah during his stint with the Mumbai Indians in the 2014 IPL . Hussey’s reflections provide insight into Bumrah’s early career, his unconventional style, and his remarkable journey to becoming one of the world’s premier bowlers.Hussey vividly recalled his first net session against Bumrah. ""I remember facing him in the nets and literally couldn't get bat on the ball. I felt like I was using a toothpick,"" Hussey shared on Willow Talk. The left-hander was immediately struck by Bumrah's deceptive action and sheer pace.""I couldn't even see the ball, let alone pick it coming out of his hand. His action is so different, so deceptive. My first impression? I honestly didn't think he'd even make it to the crease. His run-up was staggered and awkward. I remember thinking, ‘Who is this guy?' And then suddenly, woof - the ball whistles past my eyebrows at 145kph!""At the time, Bumrah was perceived as a white-ball specialist, with many doubting his durability in Test cricket due to his unique bowling action and unusual run-up. ""In India, there was so much scepticism. People said his action and run-up would be too hard on his body, that he wouldn't last in Test cricket,"" Hussey noted. ""But even back then, I could see his skills and ability. I knew that if he had the desire to play Test cricket, he could succeed.""Reflecting on Bumrah's evolution, Hussey was full of admiration.

Watching him transform from a kid in the nets who terrified us to one of the best bowlers in the world has been incredible.""Hussey also recalled a key moment early in Bumrah's IPL career. In a 2014 match against RCB, Bumrah dismissed the legendary AB de Villiers . However, his fiery send-off to de Villiers caught the attention of Hussey, who offered the young bowler some advice.""I told him, 'Mate, you don't need to do that. You have so much skill and talent. Just getting the wicket is the biggest statement you can make. If you want respect in the game and from your peers, you don't need send-offs.'""Hussey acknowledged the send-off was uncharacteristic for Bumrah, whom he described as ""one of the most humble and down-to-earth cricketers I've met."" He added, ""He's always smiling, always calm, and consistent in his behaviour. It's one of the reasons he's such a phenomenal bowler and such a joy to watch.""",Former Australian cricketer Michael Hussey has shared his memories of encountering a young Jasprit Bumrah during his stint with the Mumbai Indians in the 2014 IPL.

NEW DELHI: Mumbai batter Prithvi Shaw has been on the wrong side of news lately, facing criticism over poor fitness, discipline and attitude.The 25-year-old recently drew flak from a Mumbai Cricket Association official, who brought to the notice that even seniors in the Mumbai side were complaining about his attitude.In the midst of the criticism, Shaw, late on Friday, shared a cryptic post on his Instagram, pointing out that many have been commenting on him without knowing full facts.""If you don't understand it fully, don't speak on it. Too many people have full opinions, with half the facts,"" Shaw wrote.Earlier, Shaw had voiced his frustration after being left out of the 16-member squad for the Vijay Hazare Trophy, despite playing a key role in the team's title-winning campaign in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy.Responding to Shaw's outburst, an MCA official told news agency PTI that Shaw is 'his own enemy'""In the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, we were playing with 10 fielders as we were forced to hide Prithvi Shaw.

R Ashwin announces retirement from Test cricket

Why R Ashwin retirement was a last minute surprise for Ravindra Jadeja

Stadium Walkthrough series: Inside The Gabba

NEW DELHI: Ravichandran Ashwin announced his retirement from international cricket earlier this week, bringing an end to his illustrious career following the Gabba Test against Australia. The 38-year-old spinner retires as India’s second-highest wicket-taker across all formats, trailing only the legendary Anil Kumble.Ashwin’s impact on Test cricket has been monumental. He claimed 11 Player of the Series awards, the most by any cricketer in men’s Test history, cementing his status as one of India’s greatest match-winners.Over the years, comparisons between Ashwin and fellow Indian spin legend Harbhajan Singh were frequent. Speculation about a rift between the two spinners has often surfaced, suggesting strained relations.However, Harbhajan recently dispelled such rumors following Ashwin’s retirement, asserting that there is no truth to the claims of discord between them.""I read social media only as much as I need to. If there is a standoff between me and Ashwin or if there was ever any fight, quarrel or disagreement, I would be the first person to go up to him and ask what the issue is,"" Harbhajan Singh said on his YouTube channel.""But it was never like this, and it will never be like this because whatever is in his destiny, he will get it, and I got whatever was in my destiny. He has been a phenomenal bowler for India. I am very happy for his achievement,"" he added.""If people twist things on Twitter and make it seem as if I have a problem with Ashwin, then it's their point of view. I am a little vocal about the fact that the pitches on which India play cricket are not good tracks, there is a lot of spin on these tracks and matches get over within two and a half days,"" said Harbhajan.""Because I am vocal about it, there is a lot of noise on social media, and people think I have a problem with one individual. I don't have a problem with any individual, I respect everyone because it is not easy to play for the country. They are all my colleagues. They are all my brothers, some elder, some younger,"" said Harbhajan.Ashwin picked 765 wickets in international cricket in 379 innings, while Harbhajan scalped 707 wickets in his illustrous career.","Ravichandran Ashwin retires as India's second-highest wicket-taker across all formats.

Karelis’s goal helps Mumbai steal yet another 1-0 win,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/indian-super-league/top-stories/kareliss-goal-helps-mumbai-steal-yet-another-1-0-win/articleshow/116554717.cms,"Image credit: ISL

Mumbai: “Sometimes, one goal is, for me, enough,” Mumbai City coach Petr Kratky had said on the eve of his side’s Indian Super League clash with Chennaiyin.Having beaten bottomplaced teams Hyderabad and Mohammedan SC by a 1-0 margin in two of their last three fixtures, the Islanders boss was left content with another narrow win at the Mumbai Football Arena on Saturday, as Greek striker Nikolaos Karelis ’s calm finish in just the eighth minute was enough for the hosts to grab their fifth victory of the season. The performance, however, left Kratky far from pleased, with the reigning ISL Cup holders often guilty of cheap giveaways in transition.“No, I wasn’t to be honest, I’m looking for football, to keep the ball and to control the game,” the Czech later said when asked if he was satisfied with his team’s overall showing, besides the three points won.“Sometimes, the cheap turnovers, I get very frustrated about that. If it’s under pressure, I accept that, but without pressure it’s very difficult for me. But we try to work on that, obviously it takes time.”What didn’t take Mumbai much time in Saturday’s early kick-off was finding the back of the net. After seeing a good penalty shout for a handball by Chennaiyin captain Ryan Edwards turned down just minutes into the game, the Islanders found themselves in front through a bit of good fortune. Picking up a short pass from Lallianzuala Chhangte, Dutch pivot Yoell Van Nieff charged down the middle, then saw his scuffed attempt to find Karelis take a deflection off Edwards and fall perfectly for the Greek to place his effort past Mohammad Nawaz from point blank. Chennaiyin coach Owen Coyle would later rue the goal as one “you wouldn’t concede on a school ground”.The Marina Machans thought they were back on level terms in the closing minutes of the half when TP Rehenesh was too casual in dealing with an Irfan Yadwad cross from the right, allowing Hnamte to acrobatically direct the loose ball towards Daniel Chukwu who headed home. The assistant referee’s flag, however, rightly went up as the Nigerian was offside.The result propelled Mumbai to fourth place (12 matches, 20 points) in the standings while a fourth loss from their last five matches leaves Coyle’s side stuck in ninth (13 matches, 15 points).Fourth win for EB East Bengal FC defeated Jamshedpur FC 1-0 in Kolkata. Dimitrios Diamantakos was on target for the home side as they maintained their mid-season rise under Oscar Bruzon. The Red & Golds secured their fourth win in their last five matches in the competition. Jamshedpur FC, on the other hand, were inefficient in creating and finishing chances.",Mumbai City beat Chennaiyin 1-0 in their Indian Super League clash on Saturday. Greek striker Nikolaos Karelis scored the only goal of the game in the eighth minute. The result sees Mumbai move up to fourth place in the ISL standings.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116554714,imgsize-42838,width-400,resizemode-4/116554714.jpg"

Gabriel Jesus put up a show to dominate proceedings with a his double strike in Arsenal 's massive 5-1 win over Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park on Saturday.Jesus continued his goal-scoring tough after a hat-trick against the same opponents in Wednesday's League Cup quarter-finals.The win pushed Arsenal up and within three points of Premier League leaders Liverpool.Arsenal climbed to third position, surpassing Nottingham Forest, accumulating 33 points from 17 matches. Liverpool leads with 36 points from 15 matches, whilst Chelsea holds 34 points from 16 matches. Palace remains positioned 15th.He struck twice within the opening 15 minutes and nearly secured another hat-trick before halftime when his header struck the post, with Kai Havertz following up to convert the rebound for a 3-1 lead.That was after the match had begun energetically with Ismaila Sarr equalising for the home side, and Palace remained competitive until Havertz's goal created an insurmountable challenge.Brazilian Gabriel Martinelli extended the lead after 60 minutes, before Declan Rice registered his first league goal of the season to complete the comprehensive victory.Arsenal's away performance in 2024 has been remarkable, with this being their sixth match scoring five or more goals across all competitions, though this particular scoreline was perhaps more generous than warranted.The victory was somewhat overshadowed by Bukayo Saka's concerning hamstring injury, forcing the England international to leave the pitch during the first half.The match's opening goal came from Jesus in the sixth minute, who capitalised on a deflected Saka cross, powerfully striking past Dean Henderson.The advantage proved short-lived, as Sarr equalised with an exceptional curling shot in the 11th minute.Jesus demonstrated his prowess when he received the ball from Thomas Partey and delivered a precise shot into the top corner from outside the penalty area.Riding high on momentum, Jesus nearly scored again with a header from Martinelli's cross that struck the post, before Havertz capitalised on the rebound.In the second half, David Raya made two outstanding saves to maintain Arsenal's advantage. The team extended their lead when Martinelli tapped in from close range following a chaotic sequence after Jesus's initial attempt was blocked.Substitute Rice sealed Arsenal's victory with a well-executed finish, ensuring the team entered the holiday fixtures with a positive result.",Gabriel Jesus scored twice in Arsenal's 5-1 win over Crystal Palace. Ismaila Sarr and Kai Havertz also scored for the Gunners. Gabriel Martinelli and Declan Rice scored the other goals for Arsenal.

He received a pass from Anthony Gordon , took a touch inside the box, and fired a shot past Ipswich goalkeeper Arijanet Muric.Ipswich's attempted clearance from their own penalty area in first-half stoppage time backfired.

American men haven't had results like the women:

Graf was the hardest victory I ever had: Agassi

BENGALURU: Andre Agassi wondered if the 24-time major winner Novak Djokovic would miss his greatest rivals -- the now-retired Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer -- in the last leg of a glittering career where the 37-year-old goes for more history.The eight-time Grand Slam champion, in the city for the TiE Global Summit, assessed Djokovic's run and the Serb's recent partnership with friend and rival Andy Murray in a candid chat with media.It's hard to say, Father Time always wins. He has already done so much for so long, it's hard to imagine longer. We said that about (Roger) Federer too. I think Novak will run out of energy more than capability. Cannot be easy, especially when the people you came to the dance with have left, that's a big thing.When Pete (Sampras) retired it was a blow to me, it set me back a little bit. It made me rediscover my inspirations on some level. Djokovic has lost the guys he made history with. It'll probably get tougher and tougher emotionally, but I would never bet against them. Bet against them at your peril.In any coach-student relationship you need trust and trust can take time, but it's nice when it starts with believing in somebody because you know that they know your experience. There's an asset to their history as competitors.Any success of a relationship is based on complete buy-in and that's always the part you have to wait and see. It's not what I know that changes your career, information doesn't lead to transformation, somebody has to counter that. That's the connector. I'm sure there's going to be a lot of trust immediately, we'll see how the results go.Alcaraz defends like Novak, has more power and spin like Nadal, hands and finesse like Federer but just because he has the best of all the three doesn't mean he can do what they did. There are so many parts to the game such as decision-making, injuries, luck. So how long can (Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner) do it (for)? They could do it for 20 years or not.The women's game hasn't had to deal with Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic, Rafael, Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, but they have their version of it. Serena Williams is the Novak of the women's game and you got Coco as a potential, like Alcaraz has potential and Sinner has potential.How the game evolves is interesting. The women's game has gotten very powerful, just straight power. For lack of a better example, Lindsay Davenport was powerful, tall, precise through the court and now you have a lot of that. There's still room for somebody who can offset that kind of power, like an Ash Barty.The men's game has changed in the sense that guys have gotten bigger with longer levers, which means they're better athletes, they can move and they need more time, they start playing further back. Soon you're going to start seeing the net game start coming back, everything morphs in its own way. But the biggest issue for American (men) not winning is an unfortunate set of decades where the guys were very stingy and very greedy -- 66 Grand Slams in the same generation. There's not a lot left there (for others)!Andre Agassi - the second of five men to achieve a career Grand Slam in the Open Era and the first man to complete a career golden slam - has won it all, including a stirring love match.""She was the hardest victory I ever had,"" said Agassi of his wife German tennis legend Steffi Graf, a 22-time major winner.Agassi, who has won eight major titles and the Olympic gold, speaking during a session at the TiE Global Summit, said, ""We all live a hero's journey - first part of life is about performing and achieving. Then life hits us with broken relationships and dreams. I went through it all. Finally, in the last phase of the journey, it's about serving others.""The 54-year-old said, ""At 28 my (tennis) career started over. Without the struggles, I would've never gotten Steffi to say yes. I tried to get her for years.""On a lighter note, Agassi said he likes to keep his trophies out of the house. ""I don't bring my trophies home, because if I bring my trophies home, then she brings her trophies home - and that's bad math!""",Andre Agassi believes Novak Djokovic will run out of energy more than capability. The eight-time Grand Slam champion is in the city for the TiE Global Summit. Agassi is the second of five men to achieve a career Grand Slam in the Open Era.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116235384,imgsize-29004,width-400,resizemode-4/116235384.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Legendary player Andre Agassi observed that Carlos Alcaraz embodies distinct qualities from Novak Djokovic Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal , while advising the tennis world against anticipating the young Spaniard to match the extraordinary achievements of these tennis legends.The collective Grand Slam victories of Federer, Nadal and Djokovic stand at 66, whilst Alcaraz, aged 21, has secured four major titles thus far.""I'm not a genius and I don't have a crystal ball. What I can tell you is Alcaraz defends like Novak, has power and spin like Nadal and has hands and finesse like Federer,"" said Agassi during a talk session in Bengaluru.The eight-time Grand Slam victor Agassi elaborated on why excessive expectations shouldn't burden Alcaraz.""Just because he has the best of all those three doesn't mean he can do what they did because there're so many other parts to the game, which mean decision-making, injuries, you know, luck,"" he said.With Djokovic at 37, approaching retirement, Agassi noted that the Serbian's competitive edge might diminish without Nadal and Federer in the arena.""He's already done so much, so long, and it's hard to imagine longer. I think he'll run out of the energy for it more than the capability of it, I would imagine.""It cannot be easy, especially when the people you came to the dance with have left.""The American provided additional context to his assessment.""When Pete (Sampras) retired, it was a blow to me. It set me back a little bit. It made me have to rediscover my inspirations on some level.""And he's (Djokovic) lost the guys that he's made history with. So, it's probably emotionally going to get tougher and tougher quickly, but I would never bet against him. Bet against him at your own peril,"" said Agassi.Regarding Djokovic's recent appointment of Andy Murray as coach to extend his career, Agassi expressed interest in their partnership's development.""They've been fierce rivals on court, and now Murray will be coaching Djokovic. Well, in any coaching student relationship, you need trust. Trust can take time.""I think there's an asset to their history as competitors, but any success of a relationship is based on complete buy-in.""",Andre Agassi says Carlos Alcaraz embodies distinct qualities from Novak Djokovic Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal.
