Netherlands coach Ronald Koeman has taken a calculated risk by including key midfielder Frenkie de Jong and forward Memphis Depay in his final 26-man squad for the European Championship in Germany.Both players have been dealing with injuries recently, but with UEFA expanding squad sizes from 23 to 26 players for the tournament, Koeman sees it as a risk worth taking.Koeman, who aims to lead the Dutch side to their first continental title since 1988, a tournament he participated in as a player, understands the importance of having key players like de Jong and Depay available despite their fitness concerns.Despite the extended squad size, there is no place for uncapped left-back Ian Maatsen, who is set to feature for Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League final against Real Madrid on Saturday.Additionally, Quinten Timber and goalkeeper Nick Olij have also missed out on selection. Marten de Roon, who is nursing an injury, will also be absent, creating an opportunity for Liverpool's Ryan Gravenberch to make a return to the national team after more than a year.","Netherlands coach Ronald Koeman has taken a calculated risk by including key midfielder Frenkie de Jong and forward Memphis Depay in his final 26-man squad for the European Championship in Germany.

Virat Kohli's childhood coach suggests MS Dhoni for India's head coach role; Gautam Gambhir remains the front-runner,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/virat-kohlis-childhood-coach-suggests-ms-dhoni-for-indias-head-coach-role-gautam-gambhir-remains-frontrunner/articleshow/110548847.cms,"NEW DELHI: With the deadline to apply for the Indian men's cricket team's head coach role ending on May 27, speculation is rife about who will replace Rahul Dravid . BCCI secretary Jay Shah hinted that the new head coach is likely to be an Indian, with reports suggesting Gautam Gambhir as the top contender. However, Virat Kohli 's childhood coach, Rajkumar Sharma , has floated the idea of MS Dhoni taking up the role.Speaking to India News, the Dronacharya awardee coach expressed his views on Dhoni being an ideal candidate.""First of all, it will be interesting to see which names apply for this post. I would like that whoever becomes the coach should be an Indian. If Mahendra Singh Dhoni announces retirement, he can prove to be a good option. He (Dhoni) has played a lot of cricket and has won big tournaments,"" Sharma said.While Dhoni has not officially announced his retirement from the IPL, his future remains uncertain. The IPL 2024 was speculated to be his final season, but the Chennai Super Kings legend has kept everyone guessing. CSK CEO Kasi Viswanath even stated that he expects Dhoni to return for another season.Sharma emphasized Dhoni's potential impact as a coach, citing his experience and respect within the team.""Dhoni will have more respect in the dressing room and he has played this format for a long time. Being able to plan for the team and manage it properly is most needed in the team because when Dhoni became the captain, there were big players in that team like Sachin Tendulkar, Virender Sehwag, Rahul Dravid, Harbhajan Singh, Anil Kumble, Gautam Gambhir, and Yuvraj Singh. Despite this, Dhoni handled the team brilliantly,"" Sharma added.Dhoni previously worked with the Indian team as a mentor during the 2021 T20 World Cup in the UAE, showcasing his potential as a guiding figure for the team. As Dravid's contract ends this year after the T20 World Cup, the appointment of his successor is highly anticipated.Gambhir, who recently mentored Kolkata Knight Riders to their third IPL title, is seen as a strong candidate for the head coach position. His success with KKR and experience as a former India player make him a compelling choice.","The deadline to apply for the Indian men's cricket team's head coach role ends on May 27.

"With T20 World Cup in US, crowd-friendly format is ready to take a giant leap",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-mens-t20-world-cup/with-t20-world-cup-in-us-crowd-friendly-format-is-ready-to-take-a-giant-leap/articleshow/110549631.cms,"ALSO SEE:

It was 2009 and T20 cricket was trying to find its feet. There was still an element of doubt attached to the format but the stakes were slowly becoming higher, with India having already won the World T20 in 2007 and the first edition of the IPL having become a huge success.The second season of the IPL had to be organized in South Africa because the general elections in India were on, but what was astonishing was the sheer number of spectators at every ground.Be it Newlands, St George’s Park, Wanderers or Kingsmead — virtually every game of an Indian domestic competition was a sell-out. The crowds were not just Indians and Pakistanis living in South Africa.It was during that IPL that Aussie great Matthew Hayden made a prediction while chatting with TOI.“This is just the start. See how this format grows. In 10 years’ time, I see T20 cricket as part of the Olympics and the crowds in the United States lapping it up. If cricket has to go global, it has to have a market in the US and T20 is the only answer for that,” Hayden had said.It has taken a little more than a decade for Hayden’s words to come true. Now, T20 is truly on the doorstep of a global boom. With the Indian cricket board (BCCI) backing off from its “no to Olympics” stand, world bodyICC was able to push the sport into the Los Angeles roster for 2028.Before that, the format faces its first test when 16 matches of the first phase of the T20 World Cup , including the marquee India-Pakistan clash, gets under way in the US.“The demand for tickets for the India-Pakistan game (being played in the Nassau County ground, 35 kms east of Manhattan) is phenomenal. It will be a blockbuster game and cricket in the US truly needs a match like this,” US Cricket chairman Venu Pisike told TOI.Pisike made an interestingpoint when he said that for US audiences — beyond the subcontinental diaspora — to love cricket, it has to be “high intensity”.It is precisely this search for ‘high intensity’ that has seen the format going through incredible evolution over the years. The first T20 final on a Wanderers batting beauty was won with 157 runs on the board. One can rest assured that at the same ground on a similar pitch in 2024, 157 would be chased down in 15 overs.The pitches have got more and more batting friendly, power-hitting has become the most important ingredient of cricket, and two new rows in the statistics columns have become most telling — strike rate for batters and economy-rate for bowlers. No one cares about averages anymore. A six-ball 20 carries more weight than a 40-ball 50 in today’s T20.Such is the paradigm shift that Sunil Gavaskar, the high-priest of orthodox cricket, doesn’t mind having a go at Virat Kohli for maintaining a strike-rate of 150, promptly inviting troll armies questioning the batting credentials of the original ‘Little Master’.Run feast probably reached its peak in this year’s IPL with eight 250-plus scores being registered and 261 being chased down by back-benchers Punjab Kings against champions Kolkata Knight Riders at Eden Gardens. Before this IPL, the 250-barrier had been broken twice, and the obvious question that surfaced was whether we would see this batting monstrosity carry on in the World Cup as well.The curator for the Nassau County ground has promised a batting beauty and with India taking on Ireland, Pakistan and USA at this venue, we may just see six-hitting mayhem extending through the first couple of weeks of the T20 World Cup.But there’s an interesting catch to this narrative. For India, the business end of this World Cup — Super 8s, semis and final — shifts to the West Indies where the pitches, over the last few years, haven’t exactly been conducive for slambang action. Also, gone are the days of Sabina Park green-tops and a West Indian pace quartet breathing fire.Jamaica in fact, doesn’t figure in the list of six West Indian venues. This is the age of Sunil Narine (though he doesn’t play for West Indies anymore), and pitches are expected to be slow, with spinners coming into play. All of India’s matches are day-games as well, which will mean that there will be no dew, leaving the spinners Ravindra Jadeja, Yuzvendra Chahal and Kuldeep Yadav at their most potent.Bowlers, though, don’t mind this dam to the run-deluge, especially after getting hammered for the last two months. Australian paceman Mitchell Starc, who won KKR the IPL with two match-winning spells in Qualifier 1 and final, said: “The impact player rule won’t be there, which would mean that a batting allrounder won’t walk in at No. 8 or 9 and you may not get to see 270-80 scores too often. And the pitches may have a say in the Windies, with bowlers having a bigger role and spinners being more threatening.”But then, modern T20 has made the batters more brave, conditions do not always stop them from going about their gig. Starc definitely can’t vouch for his countrymates Travis Head or Glenn Maxwell to slow down just because the ball is stopping a bit.And for us, it’s about finding the best spot on the couch every evening for one more month.","16 matches of the first phase of the T20 World Cup gets under way in the US. The pitches have got more and more batting friendly, power-hitting has become the most important ingredient of cricket.

""It was all about the mental side of things, whether I'll be able to push as much in the lead-up to the tournament, whether if I don't play as many matches, will I be okay with it,"" he added.Reflecting on what kept him motivated after a challenging IPL season last year, Karthik revealed his intrinsic drive.""I am internally very, very motivated. Intrinsically, extremely motivated and I've lived by the mantra that if you are the best, no one can stop you. I just believed if I get one chance, I should make the most of it. I never cribbed. I was always thinking like I got a chance but I missed it. I got a tournament here, but I probably could have done better in this match. And that kept me going,"" he said.Karthik has been a constant presence in the IPL since its inception in 2008, playing 257 matches, making him the joint second-most capped player in IPL history alongside Rohit Sharma , and just behind MS Dhoni (264).As he navigates retirement, Karthik mentioned that family functions have kept him occupied and discussed the emotions he felt leading up to his final match.""I don't think it's sunk in yet. There's lots happening in the house, there's a couple of weddings and all so I've been pretty busy with that. It's a tad bit emotional, a tad bit relief. In a way, I was mentally prepared for whenever it had to happen. But I was so much more prepared for 18th May.""""Once that part of the tournament was crossed, I was extremely elated and very, very happy and grateful.

They later taken on USA and Canada, before going into the Super 8s, which will be played in the West Indies.""India start as favourites to win the tournament. The current Indian team is amongst the best in the world, I would say. If they had to keep players like (Shubman) Gill (KL) Rahul and Rinku (Singh) out, I'm sure that this is a very strong side. It's a fantastic team. If they play as per their ability, I'm sure that they'll win the Cup, but they must believe that they are the best in the world. I'm sure that if they use their experience and tactics of the IPL, they'll have a very good chance,"" Vengsarkar said on Wednesday at a Sports Journalists' Association of Mumbai function to honour veteran sports journalists at the Wankhede Stadium, where he was the chief guest.Vengsarkar tipped India to beat Pakistan in the south Asian cricket giants encounter during the tournament. ""It's a big match for the players of both the teams, because you've to win the match as Pakistan are India's traditional rivals for many years. Pakistan have a good side. The India-Pakistan match is more of a mental game than a physical one. I think that the team which is mentally stronger will win, because of the pressure involved. India definitely start as the favourites in that match. As I said, they've a fantastic team,"" Vengsarkar said.Finding it slightly tough to pick his four potential semifinalists, Vengsarkar said, ""It's very difficult to say that, because the least fancied team can beat the best side in this kind of a tournament. I think India, Australia, England and the fourth team is anybody's guess!"" Asked who India's key players could be in the T20 World Cup, Vengsarkar said, ""It's very difficult to say this in this format. Anything can happen. I can't say that 'X' 'Y' or 'Z' are the key players of the team. In this format, any body can win the match at any time in the game. Like in the IPL, the first six overs are very important. Getting a good start with bat and ball is very important,"" Vengsarkar said.Vengsarkar was the chairman of the selection committee when India had clinched the inaugural T20 World Cup in South Africa back in 2007. Recalling that time, the veteran of 116 Tests said, ""When we started out in 2007, the BCCI was the last board to accept the T20 format. So, we didn't see anybody playing in this format. So, it was very difficult for us to pick the side. We made MS Dhoni captain of the team. We wanted players who 'll bring in energy (to the team), who are aggressive and are young. I remember that our first match was against Pakistan, and it went to the last ball. India won that match, and then Yuvraj Singh smashed those six sixes off England pacer Stuart Broad in one over, and then India won a thrilling final against Pakistan. Basically, everybody played well.""""Of course, over the years, the BCCI started the IPL, and the Indian players have played fantastic cricket in it.

NEW DELHI: To some, it might appear as extreme arrogance, but when Riyan Parag looks you in the eye and declares, ""I am going to play for India no matter what,"" it's a testament to his immense self-belief in his own skill set and abilities.""At some point, you'll have to take me, right? So that is my belief, I'm going to play for India. I don't really care when,"" Parag stated confidently during his exclusive interaction with PTI on Wednesday.No youngster has polarized opinions as quickly as the 22-year-old from Assam, who had a breakout IPL season, amassing 573 runs at a strike rate close to 150 while batting at No. 4 for the Rajasthan Royals In his previous five years in the IPL, Riyan, a 2018 U-19 World Cup winner, never even reached a 200-run season. He faced harsh criticism on social media as he transitioned from boyhood to manhood.""When I was not scoring runs - I said this in an earlier interview as well - that I am going to play for India,"" Parag reiterated on the sidelines of a Red Bull Campus Cricket tournament in Mumbai on Wednesday, a tournament he praised for giving exposure to talented youngsters.""That is me believing in myself. That is not me being arrogant. That was my plan with my dad (former Railways and Assam player Parag Das) when I started playing cricket at around 10 years old. We (a joint project) were going to play for India regardless of anything.""Riyan, Abhishek Sharma , and Harshit Rana have a high likelihood of being selected for the upcoming cricket tour in Zimbabwe.""Whether it's the next tour, whether it's a tour in six months, whether it's a tour in one year... I don't really put my thought behind when I should play. That is the selector's job, that is other people's job,"" Riyan said.Having learned the hard way about the downsides of social media, he has stopped taking things to heart.""You've got to be very quick and very sharp when reacting to things. Social media and all of that play a big part with mental pressure. Because once you start listening to those things... it always starts in a merry way, right?,"" he asked.""Once you start performing, people really hype you up. Once you start reading that, you get that satisfaction of listening to other people or watching other things.""This year's IPL served as a testament to his belonging at the elite level.""But what I've figured out in the last year or two is that I've got to have an undeniable stack of proof that I belong at this level. Which means (that) me practising a lot, me practising at that level, practicing those situations,” Parag said.What has been his biggest takeaway from the season.""The biggest thing that I've taken away from the last season is that believing in yourself actually works out, because a lot of people say a lot of different things, whether it's negative, whether it's positive. But at the end of the day, what matters is what you think about yourself and that is what I've been for,"" he said.Since his debut season with the Rajasthan Royals in 2018, Riyan's performance over the past five seasons has been disappointing, with his totals reading 160, 86, 93, 183, and 78.""I had a lot of rough seasons, more than (the) nice ones and I feel having that constant belief in yourself, that you actually belong in this level, that you can actually do things that you (had) dreamt of, has been a constant and that will stay throughout.""""What you saw this year in the IPL is how I play domestic cricket. I take the onus up to myself, I take the expectations, I take the burden upon myself to deliver and that is why I play the best,"" he said.So what changed from previous years?""I was not doing that in the IPL. I was taking way too much pressure, keeping my expectations way too high and not doing the basic things right.""Additionally, playing at a crucial No. 4 slot for RR also worked.""That is what I figured (that) I had to do this year; of playing at my favourite position as well, No 4 . I was like, okay, ""I do this at domestic cricket, this is the same thing I'm going to do in IPL and let's see how it goes"". It worked out perfectly,” he said.During a substantial period in this IPL season, RR enjoyed a commendable streak, only to see their momentum wane as they reached the playoffs, ultimately securing the third position. Parag conceded that there's still a tinge of disappointment hanging in the air.""""I'm still dealing with it. I got back home and I was super sad. The night after the game, it didn't really sink in. But then the day after the match, and before the final, it was tough,"" he said.""It's tough, but then that's how cricket goes.

That's what I talk about (when I mention) his strike rate. I felt that he was afraid to get out because he was worried about what is behind him rather than (saying), 'I'm so good'.

I have said a thousand great things about Virat Kohli but I say one thing negative or construed to be negative, and I get death threats. That's the shame of it,"" he said.""There has never been an issue and I would never have a reason to have personal problems.

He believes that an open dialogue fosters a positive environment, where players feel valued and motivated to perform at their best.Rohit feels the ultimate challenge for any captain is to make sure every player is on the same page.""The biggest challenge for any captain is to handle different kinds of players, since every individual has a separate thought process and varying demands. What a captain can do is absorb all things and respond accordingly.The biggest thing I have learned since becoming captain is that every player should be given equal importance so that everyone feels that they are part of this team and they are important,"" Rohit said on Star Sports .""Whenever someone comes up to you with a problem, you must listen carefully and give them the best solution. I believe that I have to prepare not only as a captain but also as a player,"" Rohit further said.Rohit clearly stated that his approach to leading the team is a little different.""My approach to captaincy is different, as I believe in more data-based analysis and understanding of the new trends. I spend a lot of time in meeting rooms to prepare myself for certain situations that might arise during the match. It's basically not for the player but for me because I need to know about these situations, and when they come on the field, I should be ready with answers.This is the way I prepare as I go through everything, and if I feel that some important things need to be shared with the players, then I do it with them; otherwise, if it's not important, then I won't. But for me, I go with my prep to get to know about the ground, the opposition, and how the team against me is playing of late.The T20 format is always changing, and each player is playing differently. You need to understand their style of play, and as per that, we tell our bowlers and batters to plan accordingly.

NEW DELHI: Barcelona have named Hansi Flick , the former coach of the German national team and Bayern Munich , as their new head coach on a two-year deal.Flick, who has been out of club management since his dismissal from the German team in September 2023, will be responsible for turning around Barcelona's fortunes following a disappointing season under Xavi Hernandez , who was fired on Friday.The club's statement emphasized Flick's reputation for ""high pressing, intense and daring style of play which has brought him great success at club level and international level, winning pretty much all there is to win in the world of football"".They specifically highlighted his achievements with Bayern during the 2019-20 season, when he led the team to six titles, including the Bundesliga , German Cup, Champions League, German Super Cup, UEFA Super Cup, and Club World Cup.Flick faces a significant challenge in addressing Barcelona's on-field issues while also navigating off-field turmoil, such as the club's financial difficulties and an ongoing refereeing scandal.He gained recognition as an assistant to Germany manager Joachim Low during their victorious 2014 World Cup campaign before joining Bayern as head coach in 2019, where he secured seven trophies in two seasons.Despite his success at Bayern, Flick's tenure with the German national team was marred by criticism following their early exit from the 2022 World Cup and a heavy home defeat to Japan in a friendly, which ultimately led to his dismissal in September 2023. Barcelona's statement emphasized their belief in Flick as a ""champion coach"" who can bring his winning mentality to the club.The 59-year-old had been seen watching Barcelona matches from the presidential box this season and was rumored to be in line for the job after Xavi announced his intention to leave in January. Although Xavi and the club initially agreed he would stay for another season, president Laporta ultimately decided to dismiss him last week.Xavi warned his successor that the job would be challenging, stating, ""It won't be easy at all -- they will suffer and they will need patience because it's a really difficult job"". He added that ""The only thing that can save them is winning, whether they have been part of the club or not.""In addition to finishing second to Real Madrid in La Liga , Barcelona was eliminated from the Champions League in the quarter-finals by Paris Saint-Germain.Reports suggest that Laporta was angered by Xavi's comments in May, which highlighted the economic challenges Barcelona faced when competing against Real Madrid and other top European clubs.",Barcelona appoint Hansi Flick as their new head coach on a two-year deal.

I know how to play in different conditions,” Rybakina said of the heavy conditions. “For sure physically I'm much better than last year since I had to withdraw. The questions are quite the same, so I don't know what to say anymore.”Rybakina’s serve and sharp shot-making has helped her claim three titles in 2024, including Brisbane and Abu Dhabi, but it is her most recent triumph, at Stuttgart, that she takes into the clay court major. Rybakina beat world number one and three-times French Open winner Iga Swiatek in three sets in the semi-finals at Stuttgart to record a form result.The Moscow-born Kazakh, who has a clay court win-loss record of 8-1 this year, has split meetings (1-1) with Sabalenka this season.“The goal is for me to win titles. That's what I want. That's what I'm aiming for,” Rybakina said.","Aryna Sabalenka and Elena Rybakina are the second and fourth seeds in the Roland Garros women’s draw.

Need to clear my head and be ready for Olympics: Rafael Nadal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/french-open/need-to-clear-my-head-and-be-ready-for-olympics-rafael-nadal/articleshow/110506220.cms,"PARIS: The 2024 season was supposed to be Rafael Nadal ’s last in the sport. A curtain call. The tennis world had steeled itself.After a year spent in repairing and rehabbing a repelling body, the 37-year-old was ready to start in Australia in January. Until he wasn’t. More issues. Abdominal, then hip or the other way round. The Spaniard was in an impossible race to get his body ready for Roland Garros . In the end, he was short by a few tournament weeks.In the lead-up to this fortnight’s clay court major, Nadal’s body was falling in step, and in the last week, it allowed him the elasticity to stretch, to go beyond the boundaries of restraint. He was reaching further than he had in two years.It made the 22-time major winner think. Was it time yet, or did he have more steps in those legs? If anything, his straight sets loss to the in-form fourth seed Alexander Zverev late on Monday, was a confirmation.Maverick Frenchman Gael Monfils wasted no time in seconding it. “With what Rafa showed us today,” Monfils said, “he would beat so many in the draw. So many.”For now the goal is the Olympics in July-August at Roland Garros, where he hopes to play singles and doubles.“I need to clear my head and be ready for my main goal which is now to play the Olympics,” he said.The legendary Spaniard was all over the court in the first-round outing here, earning huge approval from fans on Court Philippe Chatrier. Every time his muscular frame swiveled for a sizzling forehand the fans were in a tizzy.Nadal doesn’t want regrets.“At the end, it’s about not having the (competitive) feeling for one year and a half,” he said, “but that I didn't give myself a real chance, because when I started to become a little bit healthier, I stopped.”The press conference room at Roland Garros was straining with moist-eyed adults, who were trying to assemble words for questions to the 14-time champion.“In terms of what's driving me, I'm a simple guy. I enjoy what I do. I’m passionate about sport, I’m passionate about competition. I like to practice, I like to play tennis,” he said. “I'm in a different moment of my personal life too, traveling with my son and wife. I’m enjoying these moments.”“So, if I keep enjoying doing what I’m doing and I feel competitive and healthy, I want to keep going for a while,” Nadal said. “I don't know for how long, but I want to keep going for a while. I need to give myself a little bit longer to see if my level is (getting better) and my body is holding.”“That's why I am not saying I am retiring today,” he finished.In Spanish media circles there’s an understanding that if Nadal’s body holds up he may play next year. It can be a prayer, a hymn, playing on loop. Or as Nadal would say, it’s a true, no?",Rafael Nadal loses in straight sets to Alexander Zverev in first round of French Open. The Spaniard had been expected to retire at the end of the 2014 season. The 22-time major winner says he wants to keep going for a while.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110506208,imgsize-42628,width-400,resizemode-4/110506208.jpg"

The first cut will be very strong, probably in the region of 70,” he said, adding, “we’ll have to see what follows.”Nagal, who was disappointed with his Roland Garros main draw debut, said the goal was to be able to consistently push players ranked in the top-20.“He (Khachanov) was playing almost every point with a lot of intensity,” the 26-year-old said. “That’s something I can work on, where you give opponents very few free points, it’s happening quite a bit from my side.”“The goal is to keep improving,” Nagal said, “keep battling these top-20 players. If I can do that by the end of the year, I will be at the level I want to be competing in. The only way that can happen is to play these kind of players more and more.”","Sumit Nagal will attempt a final push at the Heilbronn ATP Challenger in Germany, starting June 3.
