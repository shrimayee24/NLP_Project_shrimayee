#INDvsNZ: Rohit Sharma and Co. Need to Stop Playing On Raging Turners At Home

The possibility of Rohit Shama's unavailability for the opening Test of the Border Gavaskar Trophy (BGT) in Australia because of personal reasons is not the ideal situation for the Indian team whose hopes of qualifying for the World Test Championship (WTC) are in jeopardy after the whitewash at home against New Zealand.The Kiwis defeated India 3-0 to become the first team to register a clean sweep in a three-Test series on the Indian soil, which has rocked India's preparation and confidence ahead of their defence of the BGT.On that note, former India captain Sunil Gavaskar believes it's paramount to have clarity about the leader well before the opening match of a tour as important as Australia.""Captain should play the opening Test. It would have been different had he been injured. But if a captain is not available right in the first Test match of the series, then it would put a lot of pressure on the deputy leader and that is not easy,"" said Gavaskar talking to India Today.The batting legend said that the BCCI should name Rohit's deputy Jasprit Bumrah as the captain for the entire series as it's not clear when Rohit can join the team in Australia.He said the chief selector, Ajit Agarkar , needs to convey that to Rohit clearly.""We see reports saying Rohit won't play the opening Test, and we don't know yet about his availability for the second Test. If that is true, then Agarkar should right now tell him, 'Whatever you wish to do, you can, whether you want to take rest, you can, that is a personal reason; but for this tour you can only participate as a player. You can join the Indian squad whenever you want, but for this tour, we are naming the vice-captain as the leader',"" said Gavaskar.""There should be clarity because we lost 0-3 against New Zealand, so the captain has to be there. Indian cricket is the most important thing. Had India won the New Zealand series 3-0, it would have been a different case."".",Rohit Sharma could miss opening Test of Border Gavaskar Trophy in Australia.

NEW DELHI: Following India's 0-3 series defeat against New Zealand, discussions emerged regarding Indian batsmen's difficulties against spin bowling. Cricket legend Sunil Gavaskar expressed strong criticism of India's batting approach that resulted in a disappointing series loss. This marked a historic moment as New Zealand achieved the first-ever Test series whitewash against India on Indian soil.Gavaskar highlighted concerns about the persistent ""attacking mindset"" affecting Test cricket performance. He noted that this aggressive strategy has led to the exclusion of players like Cheteshwar Pujara and Ajinkya Rahane from the team.""The real issue is the thinking where again the short boundaries and big bats mean that batters, after playing three or four dot balls, think they can change the momentum by going for a big shot,"" Gavaskar told Sportstar.""It may work with the white ball, which doesn't swing, seam, or spin as much, but with the red ball, it's flirting with danger, especially if one has just come in to bat,"" he added.Gavaskar emphasised that Test cricket success requires patience, and Indian batsmen should adapt their approach based on playing conditions and opposition teams.""Test cricket requires some patience, especially on pitches where the bowlers are getting some assistance, but not many modern batters believe in that. Then there's this new thinking that, come what may, we will play only at breakneck speed in a five-day game, and that means there is not much thought given to tiring the bowler out or waiting for conditions to improve,"" Gavaskar said.""That's why Pujaras and Rahanes have no place in the Indian team's plans. Pujara wore down the Australian attack, as did Rahane, and so the stroke-makers could take advantage of a tired attack and flog it and make up for a slow but watchful start. That kind of thinking is not there. Now there's this business of belting the ball like England batters are doing and losing badly overseas,"" he added.",Cricket legend Sunil Gavaskar criticises India's batting approach.

India’s recent struggles against spin have been a major talking point, especially given their usual dominance in home conditions. Would you say that the ‘hunter has become the hunted’?

NEW DELHI: Team India is feeling the pressure after losing the Test series to New Zealand. It's the first time they have been whitewashed at home in a three-Test series and the poor show by batters has come under scrutiny. Both Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli were a big disappointment during the series as the experienced duo failed to get going. India are now set to take on Australia in a high-profile Border Gavaskar Trophy and need a 4-0 result to qualify for the World Test Championship final - without needing anyone else's help.Former India pacer Karsan Ghavri, who represented India in 39 Tests and 19 ODIs from 1975 to 1981, believes it's high time for Rohit and Virat to step up in red-ball cricket. According to the former left-arm pacer, their performances in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy could well determine their future in Test cricket.In an exclusive chat with, Ghavri speaks about Rohit and Virat, India's struggle against, upcoming series vs Australia and more. Edited excerpts:It was a very, very poor performance. I am really disappointed with the way our batters performed, especially Rohit and Virat. If you can’t perform well in your own conditions, what will you do in Australia? First, you lost in Bengaluru and made changes for the second Test, but then lost that match within three days. What is this? In Bengaluru, the first day was washed out due to rain, and India still suffered a defeat.I blame our batsmen for this. We are not putting enough runs on the board. In Bengaluru, we were all out for 46. In Pune, we didn’t score more than 260 in either innings. That is very poor batting. Apart from Yashasvi Jaiswal, no one showed the grit to score runs. In Tests, you need big partnerships.Our top batsmen—whether it’s Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, KL Rahul, or youngsters like Shubman Gill—needed to build at least two big stands. These batters must understand that they need to put up scores of over 350 or 400 to be competitive in a Test match. In bowling, you need to take 20 wickets. When our bowlers are struggling in home conditions, what will they do overseas? Really disappointing. There’s a big question mark. I don’t know how we’re going to fare in Australia.Neither of them is in great touch; let’s accept that. They are not scoring runs. Of course, they are class players. Class doesn’t disappear, but sometimes, both need to restart. They just need one good, big innings to get back on track. Virat and Rohit are definitely under pressure. They need to occupy the crease more and score runs. A player like Shubman Gill needs to step up and score big. Thirty or forty runs won’t help. Ravindra Jadeja has been scoring runs, but the top six batsmen must put up a solid score. Otherwise, we will continue to struggle.The new bowlers will struggle in Australia. It will be very difficult for them to bowl in those conditions. Shami should have been there. He has experience in Australia, and he is a senior bowler. Shami’s presence would have been a big support for Bumrah. India needs Shami badly. Unfortunately, he’s not there. India can’t depend solely on Bumrah. Mohammed Siraj is there, and he has some experience, but bringing in two new fast bowlers is not ideal.Yes, there will be a lot of pressure on Bumrah. He will be under immense pressure, as will Siraj. Bumrah and Siraj will have to shoulder much of the burden with the new ball. You can’t expect the third fast bowler to perform like the experienced ones. If they play three fast bowlers, you’re unsure how the third will fare, so Bumrah and Siraj will definitely have to do a lot of work.Probably the selectors are looking at the age factor. Rahane and Pujara have plenty of experience in Australia, and both have been scoring runs in Indian domestic cricket. Their presence would have been a much better option for India in Australia. We know how Rahane and Pujara have performed in Australia. They could have been given a chance. When touring Australia, you need experienced players. Unfortunately, the selectors have different ideas, and this could backfire.Australia are the favorites. India is under tremendous pressure, especially after losing the series to New Zealand. My prediction is 60 percent Australia, 40 percent India.Definitely, 200 percent yes. They need to score big. If they don’t perform, it’s time for them to call a time on their Test careers. If they don’t perform in Australia, Virat and Rohit should retire. They have done a lot for Indian cricket, but the team needs runs to win. We need to build a team for the future. How long will we keep players who aren’t performing?If they perform, keep them; if not, why select them? If players are selected without performance, then bring in Cheteshwar Pujara or Ajinkya Rahane. If Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli aren’t scoring runs, then who will score? In a country like Australia, you need experienced players who can occupy the crease, stay longer, and put up big scores. To beat Australia in Australia, you need big totals on the board.In the Test series against New Zealand, some of our batsmen played very poor shots and got out. New Zealand’s batsmen scored runs on the same pitch. Our batters seemed to play shots more suited for T20 cricket, which wasn’t needed in a Test.You need patience in Tests, to wait for the right deliveries, occupy the crease with singles and doubles, and capitalise on loose balls. Our batsmen looked clueless in their own conditions. In India, we are supposed to excel against spin bowling, but here, they struggled greatly. It’s not a good sign.",Former India pacer Karsan Ghavri believes it's high time for Rohit and Virat to step up in red-ball cricket. India are set to take on Australia in a high- profile Border Gavaskar Trophy.

India's head coach Gautam Gambhir finds himself on a sticky wicket after the team's historic lows in the Test series against New Zealand. After the lowest total of 46 in a Test innings on home soil in Bengaluru, India lost in Pune to concede the series -- first such instance since 2012. The facts and history became further embarrassing when India faced defeat in Mumbai as well to be whitewashed in a three-Test home series for the first time.Understandably, reports of BCCI to soon take stock of the situation have filtered in, with the possibility of Gambhir not being involved in selection matters going forward and asked to explain what went wrong against New Zealand.The series defeat has also jeopardised India's chances of qualifying for the World Test Championship (WTC) final. After slipping to second spot and losing their top position in the WTC table to Australia, India's chances hinge on successful defence of the Border Gavaskar Trophy in Australia by a distance.The series in Australia begins with the first Test in Perth from November 22.Team India's decision to play on turners in Pune and Mumbai backfired as New Zealand spinners Mitchell Santner and Ajaz Patel trapped India in their own net. While it has also been reported that the entire think-tank was not on the same page about the decision to roll out rank tuners, some of the experts believe that 3-4 months is too soon a time to judge anyone -- in this case Gambhir as coach.""Coaching doesn't come to you overnight,"" former India allrounder Vijay Bharadwaj said, while talking to Timesofindia.com. ""It takes a lot of time. There are lots of case studies that need to be done. It's just not about holding a degree or doing a coaching course. You keep coaching kids and teams, only then you will understand. It's just not that they come into a coaching stint, straight away take it up and then be successful. That will never be the case.""So why people are in a hurry, I don't understand. Anyways, this is a learning lesson (for Gambhir),"" he added.However, without elaborating much, Bharadwaj said Gambhir has made some ""glaring mistakes"".""He has made some glaring mistakes, which has cost us the series. Indian team's coaching is not the same as coaching an IPL team. It's a different ball game,"" said Bharadwaj, pointing towards Gambhir's successful stint as mentor in Kolkata Knight Riders ' (KKR) title-winning run in the Indian Premier League earlier this year.Following that and at the end of Rahul Dravid 's tenure as India coach, the BCCI appointed Gambhir as India's head coach and agreed to all his demands related to the support staff. Abhishek Nayar and Ryan ten Doeschate, who were also part of the KKR set-up, were appointed as assistant coaches and Morne Morkel, who worked with Gambhir at Lucknow Super Giants, joined as bowling coach.When asked where he ranks Gambhir among India's recent successful coaches, namely Ravi Shastri and Dravid, Bharadwaj decided to tag the former India opener as ""learner"" in the coaching trade.""In one word, Ravi shastri was a motivator; he never had any coaching background as such. Rahul Dravid was more of a facilitator. He had some (coaching) background with India A and the U-19 teams, but formally they are not trained coaches. Gautam Gambhir, I am sure, is in the learning mode. So, a learner. It's a long way and too early to judge anybody,"" said the former all-rounder, who recently joined Delhi Capitals as the head of the talent scout wing.While 3-4 months is a kind of hand-holding period for a big job like the Indian cricket team's head coach, losing all the Tests of a series at home won't be swept under the carpet.On that note, it's interesting to look at the numbers of Shastri and Dravid in the first four months of their coaching stint in comparison with Gambhir.- Two Tests vs Bangladesh at home (won 2-0)- Three Tests vs New Zealand at home (won 3-0)- Two Tests vs New Zealand at home (won 1-0)- Three Tests in South Africa (lost 1-2)- Two Tests vs Sri Lanka at home (won 2-0)- Three Tests in Sri Lanka (won 3-0)- Two Tests vs Sri Lanka at home (won 1-0)","India's head coach Gautam Gambhir finds himself on a sticky wicket after the team's historic lows in the Test series against New Zealand.

Why Indian batters are struggling against left-arm spin,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/new-zealand-in-india/why-indian-batters-are-struggling-against-left-arm-spin/articleshow/114962673.cms,"There's no denying faults in technique have slowly crept into the game of the T20-oriented modern batsman

If you're an Indian cricket follower with a sense of history, the capitulation against Ajaz Patel at the Wankhede Stadium on Sunday might just hurt you a little more.Ask any Indian batter of the 1980s and they would say playing the likes of Padmakar Shivalkar, Rajinder Goel or Raghuram Bhat on the domestic circuit was way more challenging than squaring up against foreign left-arm spinners.When Sunil Gavaskar finally got out to Pakistan's Iqbal Qasim on a minefield in his last Test innings at the Chinnaswamy after scoring 96, it was regarded as an exception that merely underlined the rule of general dominance by the batters.Over the years, left-arm finger spinners continued to be largely seen as restrictive options and it's hard to find one from visiting sides winning a Test match on his own on Indian soil. Michael Clarke, with a spell of 6-9 at Wankhede in 2004 came close, but VVS Laxman and Sachin Tendulkar had done enough with two superb half-centuries before that which helped India win.Things, though, have dramatically turned around since the last decade. While India's last Test series loss at home in 2012 was facilitated by England left-arm spinner Monty Panesar, little-known left-armers like Steve O'Keefe, Tom Hartley or Matthew Kuhnemann have played significant roles in India's losses in India in the last few years.But what happened against Ajaz and Mitchell Santner in the series against New Zealand - where they two took 28 of the 60 Indian wickets to fall in the series - topped it all. Superstars like Virat Kohli and Shubman Gill looked like sitting ducks and it always seemed a matter of time before the proverbial death rattle would be heard.It's true that the quality of pitches on which Test matches are being played these days are way more conducive to spin than it used to be. In addition to that, the Decision Review System (DRS) has come into play, which has taken front-foot pad play almost out of the window. In this day and age, pad as the first line of defence doesn't exist anymore and every ball has to be played with the bat, which wasn't always the case for the earlier generation.Still, there's no denying the faults in technique of the modern-day batter that have played a role in this decline in the quality of batsmanship against left-arm spin. Former India batter WV Raman, who also bowled left-arm finger spin, feels that growing up with the T20 mindset is taking its toll on the defence of the young Indian batter.""It's basically two things. While the new-age batter more often than not plays with hard hands, the bat, too, doesn't come down straight. If the bat comes straight and the ball turns a little too much, then there is always the chance of missing the outside-edge. But when the bat is coming that wee bit across the line, the outside-edge always becomes more vulnerable,"" Raman told TOI.There was a notable exception in Rahul Dravid , whose bat used to come down from the gully region, but he had the genius to adjust it at the point of contact and found a way to be behind the line of the ball. The hard-hand bit is a product of too much T20s, where every player is looking to hit the ball with ferocity. ""Soft hands are a thing of the past and it means the edges carry to the slips more regularly,"" Raman said.Sunil Subramaniam, another prominent left-arm spinner of yesteryears and one of R Ashwin's early mentors, feels the tendency to play beside the line and jabbing at the ball is making the modern-day batter vulnerable against left-arm spin.""Tendulkar, too, sometimes used to get out to left-arm spin, in fact I got him out thrice in domestic cricket. But Tendulkar used to look for shots over extra-cover because that was one of his favourite scoring areas and sometimes gave catches in that region. But I hardly remember him struggling against the ball turning away playing a defensive shot. This is completely a new phenomenon,"" Subramaniam said.Tendulkar did struggle against Panesar in the 2012 series, but by then he was in the last phase of his career. Subramaniam, who had 285 first-class wickets, explained that GR Viswanath was one player who used to play beside the line against left-arm spin successfully.""But the beauty of GRV was that he could play late with soft hands, a quality that the current crop is losing. The only player in recent times who had the correct technique to deal with it was Cheteshwar Pujara, but then he is no longer part of the team,"" the renowned coach said.He also added that batters these days don't play spinners from their hands, thereby trying to read them from the pitch, which becomes difficult on sharp turners.",India's capitulation against Ajaz Patel at the Wankhede Stadium on Sunday might just hurt you a little more. There's no denying the faults in technique of the modern-day batter that have played a role in this decline in the quality of batsmanship against left-arm spin.

'Give Tests to metros, white-ball games to the rest'

MUMBAI: The 0-3 drubbing India received at the hands of New Zealand at home not only exposed their frailties against spin bowling but also continued an interesting trend. Both the second and third Tests, in Pune and Mumbai respectively, were played on turning pitches and finished inside three days. Even the first Test in Bengaluru technically was over in four days, as Day One was a complete washout.With home teams gunning for wins that will land them precious points for a place in the World Test Championship (WTC) final, Tests are struggling to last the duration. Mostly these Tests are played either on spin-friendly pitches in the subcontinent or fast and bouncy wickets in SENA countries. Of 25 Tests played in India in the last five years, 12 finished inside three days, seven within four days, and one match - the third (pink ball) Test between India and England in Ahmedabad - was over in just two days.Most home Tests in this period were played on rank turners as India scrambled for WTC points. The advent of the Decision Review System (DRS) has meant that marginal decisions also go in favour of bowlers. The technique and temperament of the batters too has been found wanting in the post-T20 era, something that head coach Gautam Gambhir alluded to recently.Former India skipper Dilip Vengsarkar, for one, feels it's time Tests are officially reduced to four-day affairs instead of five. ""Tests should be reduced to four-day games because most of the matches are getting over in under four days. Also, most of the affiliated boards of the International Cricket Council (ICC), apart from India, Australia, and England, are not in good financial condition, so four-day Tests could save them some expenses. It is financially draining and too expensive for a team like West Indies to travel for Test matches to the rest of the world.""Besides, it's unfair to sell tickets for five days when the matches are getting over in three days,"" Vengsarkar told TOI following India's 0-3 whitewash at the hands of New Zealand. India lost the third Test at the Wankhede Stadium by 25 runs in two-and-a-half days. Former England captain Michael Vaughan and the late Australian leg spin great Shane Warne had, in the past, also batted for four-day Tests.Around four years back, the ICC had seriously mulled the idea of four-day Tests but in Jan 2020 the MCC, custodians of the laws of cricket, stated that Tests will continue to be five-day affairs. The MCC, however, did add that it saw ""some benefits"" of the ICC's proposal.""Cricket committee and MCC world cricket committee have discussed the issue and although they can see some benefits that four-day Test cricket could bring, both committees believe that Test cricket should continue to be played over five days,"" the MCC had said in a statement back then.There have been a few four-day Tests in recent years, including the England versus Ireland game at Lord's in June 2023 and a South Africa-Zimbabwe Test. Both were sanctioned by the ICC. In India, in the Ranji Trophy , matches in the league stage are played over four days.Another interesting aspect of the Mumbai Test, which concluded on Sunday afternoon, was the number of spectators who flocked to watch the match each day - at least 18,000. In fact, there was an enthusiastic crowd of around 20,000 on Day Three. Vengsarkar asserted that the BCCI must now schedule Tests only in the bigger cities and the metros while awarding white-ball matches - ODIs and T20Is - to smaller centres.""The support the Mumbaikars provided to Test cricket was overwhelming. As compared to the other venues during this series, they turned up in huge numbers even for a dead rubber. I guess the time has come to stage cricket only at Test centres like New Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Bengaluru, and Chennai. The One-Dayers and T20Is can be staged at the rest of the centres,"" the 116-Test veteran rounded off.Since the 2016-17 home season, the BCCI has been awarding Tests to smaller centres like Rajkot, Vizag, and Pune.","Former India skipper Dilip Vengsarkar feels it's time Tests are officially reduced to four-day affairs instead of five. The move, he feels, will also make financial sense for the economically weaker ICC full members.

NE WDELHI: New Zealand stunning India 3-0 at home for an unprecedented series win has left Australia wary as pacer Josh Hazlewood feels that the embarrassing loss might awaken a 'sleeping giant' ahead of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy Down Under.The Kiwis on Sunday completed a stunning series sweep, handing India their first-ever 3-0 whitewash at home.With the marquee series set to commence from November 22 in Australia, Hazlewood said that the loss against the Kiwis might have shaken India's confidence and they aren't sure what to expect from Rohit Sharma and Co.""It might awaken a sleeping giant, so to speak. We will see that when they come out,"" Hazlewood told Sydney Morning Herald.""It is obviously better them losing 3-0 than winning 3-0, easily. The confidence might have taken a bit of a hit. A lot of them have been out here (in Australia), but there is a few batters who have not, so they will be a bit unsure of what to expect. I do not think you can read too much into it. The results are obviously good for us in a way.""""Credit to the Kiwi boys. They played outstanding cricket. To win 3-0 in India is unbelievable. It's hard enough to win one game there, let alone every match of the series,"" he said.The Indian team experienced a series of batting collapses throughout the series against the BlackCaps.In the Bengaluru Test, India was dismissed for a mere 46 runs in the first innings on a seaming pitch under overcast conditions. Despite gaining a lead, they suffered another collapse in their second innings, as New Zealand hunted down the 107-run target.The second Test saw India bowl out New Zealand for 259 runs. However, their batting faltered once again, resulting in a total of 156 runs. Chasing 359 runs for victory, the Indian batsmen disappointed once more, getting dismissed for 245 runs after a promising start.The third and final Test in Mumbai was another low-scoring encounter. India were set a target of 147 runs, seemingly their easiest chase of the series. But despite a fighting half-century from Rishabh Pant, the batting lineup crumbled, ultimately bowled out for 121 runs.The India vs Australia series commences on November 22 with the first Test taking place in Perth. Adelaide Oval will host the second Test from December 6th to 10th, featuring the captivating day-night format under lights. Brisbane's Gabba will be the venue for the third Test, scheduled from December 14th to 18th.

Will Young shows he belongs at No. 3,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/new-zealand-in-india/will-young-shows-he-belongs-at-no-3/articleshow/114963754.cms,"New Zealand's Will Young. (Photo by Idrees Mohammed/AFP via Getty Images)

BENGALURU: Had a soothsayer told New Zealand's top order bat Will Young that he would walk away with the Player of the Series in what eventually turned out to be a washout of epic proportions over India in the three-Test series, he would not have believed.Not so young at 31 and only 16 Test matches old prior to coming to India, Young has often been reduced to playing waterboy for his team. He waited three years after his maiden call-up to make his Test debut against West Indies in Hamilton in Dec 2021. Even against India, he was a replacement for Kane Williamson , who didn't make the trip owing to a groin injury sustained in Sri Lanka.Young, who turns up for Nottingham in the English county, proved a thorn in India's spin-laden side. He spent 598 minutes in the middle across six innings and compiled 244 runs, the third most after Rishabh Pant (261) and teammate Rachin Ravindra (256).He showed his mastery over spin in the opening Test at the M Chinnaswamy stadium here when he elegantly drove Kuldeep Yadav through covers for his first runs. The 72 minutes Young (33 runs) spent at the crease in New Zealand's first innings in Bengaluru was full of promise until he top-edged Ravindra Jadeja to gift his wicket away. He made amends in the second innings, opening up against pacer Mohammed Siraj but playing Kuldeep, Ravindra Jadeja and R Ashwin on merit. He was all class, craft and positive intent, middling the ball with ease during his unbeaten run of 48.In Pune, Ashwin got his number in both innings, but not before he had added 41 crucial runs. His half-centuries (71 and 51) in the final Test at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai were probably his coming-of-age knocks. He played with far more confidence and courage, backing his methods and playing with soft hands on a tricky surface. His game oozed smartness as he bearded the Indian spinners on their home turf with ease.As it turned out, Young not only was a strong replacement for Williamson but actually owned the No. 3 spot. ""When I do get an opportunity to play, I'm more excited to go out and do my own thing in my way and not try to replace Kane or whoever it might be. I see it as a great opportunity rather than big boots to fill. I try not to bat like Kane, I try to bat like me and do it my own way,"" he said.He finished the series with an average of 48.8, playing a crucial role in the Black Caps' remarkable win. ""As a New Zealander coming over here and playing in Indian conditions, it's always going to be slightly more satisfying to score runs against spin,"" Young said.This series was probably the impetus Young's career needed especially to cut out the noise of his talent being a mere promise without an innings to highlight it.",Will Young named Player of the Series in New Zealand's three-Test series win over India. The 31-year-old spent 598 minutes in the middle across six innings and compiled 244 runs.

Former Australia captain Ricky Ponting believes Chennai Super Kings (CSK) might strategically rest MS Dhoni in the upcoming IPL 2025 season. This comes after CSK retained the former Indian captain for the next season of the IPL. Ponting suggests that this strategy could help CSK utilize Dhoni's experience and skills most effectively.Dhoni, who retired from international cricket in 2020, has been an integral part of CSK's success over the years. He led the team to five IPL titles, showcasing his leadership and cricketing prowess.“Two seasons ago he probably had his worst season, but then last year again, he bounced back into really impacting some games like the MS Dhoni of old,” Ponting said on the recent episode of The ICC Review.Despite a challenging season two years ago, Dhoni bounced back strongly last year, reminding everyone of his capabilities. Ponting acknowledges Dhoni's impact on the game and suggests that CSK might opt to rest him occasionally to manage his workload.“I think it will be exactly the same now…they might not get him through the whole season. They might think about leaving him out for a game and resting him up here and there to make sure that they’re getting the best out of him.”Ponting recognizes Dhoni's value to the team, not just as a player but also as a mentor and leader. He believes Dhoni's presence, whether on or off the field, will be crucial for CSK.“Any team that he's in, whether he's captain or not, he's always going to be a mentor and a leader around that group, whether he’s playing, whether he’s sitting on the sidelines, that’s just who he is…he’s crucial to Chennai, for that leadership that he brings on and off the field,” Ponting stated.Ponting highlights Dhoni's ability to maintain a high level of performance throughout his long career. He admires Dhoni's consistency and ranks him among the best players in the game.“The best players are the ones that are able to maintain such a high level for a long time…for 10, 12, 14-year careers.”Ponting emphasizes Dhoni's adaptability and evolution as a player. He points out Dhoni's shift in batting position and how he continues to make an impact despite not always facing a large number of deliveries.“He’s actually batting the last 20 balls of an innings now but still showing that you can make a big impact on the game by doing that,” Ponting added.","Ricky Ponting believes Chennai Super Kings (CSK) might strategically rest MS Dhoni in the upcoming IPL 2025 season.

NEW DELHI: Former New Zealand skipper Ross Taylor expressed amazement at the team's historic 3-0 Test series victory over India, a feat that exceeded everyone's expectations.The win in Mumbai on Sunday marked India's first home Test series loss since 2012 and New Zealand's maiden series triumph on Indian soil.The Kiwis dominance was evident throughout the series, excelling in all departments of the game and effectively containing India's strong batting lineup.The Kiwis had outstanding performances from both their bowlers and batsmen, contributing to their unprecedented success.Ajaz Patel and Mitchell Santner were among the top wicket-takers, claiming 15 and 13 wickets, respectively. while Rachin Ravindra, Will Young, and Devon Conway spearheaded New Zealand's batting with impressive scores of 256, 244, and 227, respectively.""Like most of the country, I'm just in awe of the team. I think the way they played throughout the whole series… I think we hoped more than thought we were going to win. But a clean sweep - think it still hasn't quite sunk in among the New Zealand public, probably for the players as well,"" Taylor told ESPNcricinfo.Taylor believes this remarkable triumph over India provided a much-needed boost to cricket fans back home in New Zealand, especially team's loss to Sri Lanka.""Cricket is fighting for an audience (in New Zealand). It's a rugby nation, now there's an extra football league in our local competition, so cricket after losing in Sri Lanka, the press after that has changed around completely. I don't think we've had scenes like this since winning the (last) World Test Championship and I think it just tells you how high the New Zealand cricket public holds the Indian cricket team and what it's like to go and win over there.""After winning the first Test (in Bengaluru), it gave the team as well as the public some belief, but I don't think even in our wildest dreams we imagined a clean sweep and such a convincing performance from Tom (Latham, the captain), Gary and the boys,"" he added.","Former New Zealand skipper Ross Taylor expresses amazement at the team's historic 3-0 Test series victory over India.

NEW DELHI: Powerhouse India on Sunday suffered an unprecedented and embarrassing 3-0 series loss at home against New Zealand just before their high-profile tour of Australia which starts from November 22.The recent whitewash against the Kiwis means a demoralized Indian team now has got to win 4 matches out of 5 Down Under in the upcoming Border-Gavaskar Trophy to make it to the WTC Final on their own.With very less time to regather and regroup ahead of the marquee tour, questions are being raised over the team's preparedness for the high profile series.The Indian team also recently cancelled their warm-up game ahead of the first Test in Perth and legendary Sunil Gavaskar feels that the Australia tour will be a huge mountain to climb.Gavaskar was critical of India's spin plans against the Kiwis and slammed the 'short-gain policy' of producing rank-turners.""Australia looks like a huge mountain to climb after the Indian team stumbled terribly on a speed bump called New Zealand. Nobody, not even the Kiwis themselves, would have thought of a clean sweep against India, and that too in India. It has happened thanks to the short-gain policy of preparing pitches for our spinners when just about everybody in the cricketing world agrees that we have the best new-ball bowler in the world across all formats,"" Gavaskar wrote in his column for Sportstar.Gavaskar questioned India's decision to cancel the three-day intra-squad match with the 'A' side from November 15 to 17. The team management did so to focus on additional net practice but Gavaskar feels that the match would have helped the youngsters, particularly the ones who are travelling Down Under for the first time.""We are now told that the warm-up game before the first Test has been called off. Wouldn’t it benefit youngsters like (Yashasvi) Jaiswal and Sarfaraz (Khan), who are playing on Australian pitches for the first time, to get some runs under their belt and get a feel of what the pitches will be like?""And if they get out early, they can still get into the nets and practice against the throw-down specialist or the net bowlers. For bowlers like Akash Deep and Harshit Rana too, it’s essential to know the best length to bowl in Australia, as it’s different from India, and the best learning is in a proper match and not just net practice.""Let’s just hope that good sense prevails, and even now, though it’s too late, some warm-up games can be arranged, even if it’s against the State A teams like Queensland A and Victoria A. These warm-up games will give the first-timers to Australia and youngsters good practice and a better chance to succeed, Gavaskar wrote.The first India vs Australia Test is scheduled for November 22-26. After that India are scheduled to play a 2-day warm-up game in Canberra which will be followed by the Adelaide Test.Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney will hosting the remaining three Tests.",India suffered an embarrassing 3-0 series loss at home against New Zealand just before their high-profile tour of Australia.

JFC suffer consecutive 5-goal hammering,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/indian-super-league/top-stories/jfc-suffer-consecutive-5-goal-hammering/articleshow/114964574.cms,"It proved to be another nightmare for Jamshedpur FC at JRD Tata Sports Complex on Monday as they were made to endure a 1-5 loss to Chennaiyin FC after their five-goal defeat in the last Indian Super League game.Jamshedpur's former Shield-winning coach Owen Coyle dealt a blow on Khalid Jamil's hosts with his new wards - with youngster Irfan Yadwad playing a lead role - as the visitors climbed two spots to sixth on the ISL table even as Jamshedpur held on to their fourth position after seven games with a number of seventh round fixtures still to go.The onslaught started as early as in the sixth minute when Pratik Chaudhary, in his bid to clear a Vinci Barretto cross from the left of the box, actually made a perfect finish into his own goal to the disappointment of his helpless goalkeeper Albino Gomes.Although Vishal Yumnam was a bit wide in putting in the ball in the 20th minute, Chennaiyin were gifted their second juts two minutes later. This time, it was the pace, skill and power of Yadwad as he vindicated the trust shown in him by veteran Coyle with a defence-splitting turn in the midfield that began the build-up to his first goal. The 23-year-old then made a run into the Jamshedpur box that could not be contained by the defenders led by Jamil's go-to man and captain Ashutosh Mehta as his shot at goal took a slight deflection en route the goal.There was no respite for Jamshedpur's weary defence, and Jamil at the stands, as two minutes later, in the 24th minute, Yadwad turned provider to Connor Shields - who had been missing his first goal of the season - with a pass outside the box that the Scottish shot into the right of the goal with Mehta at the other end.There was, however, no improvement in Jamshedpur's game as every trick in Khalid's book looked to have backfired in absence of defensive talisman Stepehn Eze, missing the match with a red card in the last game at NorthEast United.The script stayed the same after the change of ends as Chaudhary lost the ball a little outside the box to a Yadwad charge at him from the left in the 54th minute. It was Wilmar Jordan Gill who landed the pass from Yadwad and with only the goalkeeper to beat, made no mistake in adding the fifth to his goal tally this season.With both Jordan Murray and Javier Siverio having a bad day in office, and Jamil's 4-4-2 formation failing to stop the visitors' march, it was only a matter of time before Chennaiyin scored again and delivered a back-to-back five-goal assault on the Men of Steel. It was Lucas Brambilla's swerving solo effort from outside the box that left Gomes in another no position for a save.The hosts, with fans already leaving the Furnace, got a consolation goal after earning a controversial penalty kick from a Yadwad hand ball in the box - that was preceded by an offside call against Jamshedpur. Veteran Murray made no mistake to send in the spot kick but it was too little to ease the team and coach Jamil's disappointment after a great start to the season.",Jamshedpur lost 1-5 to Chennaiyin FC at JRD Tata Sports Complex on Monday.

Moises Caicedo 's goal prevented Manchester United from securing a win in their first Premier League game since Erik ten Hag 's exit. Chelsea earned a 1-1 draw at Old Trafford on Sunday.Interim manager Ruud van Nistelrooy celebrated on the touchline after Bruno Fernandes scored a penalty, 20 minutes before the end.

Ruben Amorim , who will take over from van Nistelrooy later this month, was not present as he is preparing for a Champions League match with Sporting Lisbon against Manchester City.Despite a better performance compared to heavy home defeats by Liverpool and Tottenham, United still showed issues that led to Ten Hag's dismissal. Van Nistelrooy previously led United to a 5-2 win over Leicester to reach the League Cup quarter-finals.Chelsea, having lost just once in nine Premier League games, posed a tougher challenge for a United side lacking in confidence. In a tepid first half, both teams hit the woodwork with attempts from Noni Madueke and Marcus Rashford.Chelsea's Pedro Neto nearly scored early in the second half, but his shot missed the post. Cole Palmer, a pivotal player for Chelsea, was kept in check by United's midfield duo Casemiro and Manuel Ugarte.Van Nistelrooy acknowledged the ongoing struggle with goal-scoring, saying, ""Over the last games we played we lost some points where we didn't convert our chances.

Alaaeddine Ajaraie continued to fuel NorthEast United ’s brightly shining lamp during the Diwali festivities as his consecutive double strike helped the hosts beat Odisha FC in a five-goal thriller in Guwahati on Sunday.The Moroccan forward followed up his double in the last match against Jamshedpur FC with another brace at Indira Gandhi Athletic Stadium as the hosts overcame the Juggernauts 3-2 with Guillermo Fernandez adding another for the Highlanders. Hugo Boumous and Diego Mauricio scored one each for Odisha but could not help their team salvage a point from the game.The hosts started the match on a strong note and allowed Odisha no time on the ball. The attacking quartet of Parthib Gogoi, Nestor Albiach, Jithin MS and Ajaraie made life difficult for the Odisha defenders.The home side was rewarded for their high pressing game when Ajaraie combined with local sensation Gogoi and found a little space just outside the box. Following a couple of touches, Ajaraie took a powerful shot from distance which beat Amrinder Singh all ends up for the lead in 12th minute. This was Ajaraie’s goal in seven consecutive league appearances, beating Elano Blumer’s earlier record of six games.Upbeat with the early lead, NEUFC added more firepower in the attacking third and Ajaraie finally completed his brace following Mohammed Bemammer and Jithin’s touches on the ball. With only Amrinder to beat from left, Ajaraie obliged in the 40th minute.Down by two goals, Odisha assistant coach Anthony Fernandes brought in midfielder Hugo Boumous and defenders Saviour Gama and Thoiba Singh at the break. The changes worked for the visitors as Gama and Boumous combined to pull one back at the hour mark.Energised by the strike, Odisha FC pushed forward to draw level, but it was never to be. Juan Pedro Benali’s boys put the scoreline beyond Odisha’s reach when substitute Fernandez converted Ajaraie’s cross in the 71st minute to make it 3-1 against the run of play.Odisha did pull another back in the 83rd minute with their Brazilian striker Mauricio scoring brilliantly from a free-kick, but it proved to be a little late to snatch a point from the hosts’ jaws.

Battered JFC take on Chennaiyin at home,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/indian-super-league/battered-jfc-take-on-chennaiyin-at-home/articleshow/114917602.cms,"(Photo credit: ISL)

After four wins from five matches, Jamshedpur FC were humbled in their last game when they were thrashed 0-5 by Northeast United FC in Guwahati last Saturday.It was a disappointing show from the former Shield winners and they will hope to bounce back strongly against Chennaiyin FC in Jamshedpur on Monday.With just eight points from six matches, the team from the South hasn’t had a great start to the tournament and is coming into the match after a loss against Punjab FC. Owen Coyle, who had led Jamshedpur to their Shield triumph, will thus be hoping to get Chennaiyin’s season back on track and get the better of a team who will surely be hurting from their big away loss.JFC coach Khalid Jamil though believes that his team will be able to make a strong comeback in front of their home fans at the Furnace.“It’s true that we suffered a tough loss, but we are determined to improve and stage a strong comeback. Losses like these are hard, but they’re also opportunities to learn and grow. We’re working hard to turn things around,” Jamil said during a press conference on Sunday.However, the home team will have to take the field without their mercurial defender Stephen Eze after he was given a red card during the last game. How the team copes with his absence against a team that has the likes of Wilmar Jordan Gil, who has netted in three straight matches, and former JFC player Daniel Chima Chukwu will indeed be interesting to see.As far as Jamshedpur’s attacking is concerned, they will be relying on the likes of Jordan Murray and Javier Siverio. They will once again be supported by Javi Hernández, Rei Tachikawa, Mohammed Sanan and Imran Khan. Barring the poor show in their last game, JFC have done quite well going forward and have scored 10 goals in six matches.And they will have to fire in unison on Monday if they are to bag their fifth win of the season and put the humiliating loss behind them. “Each player knows their responsibility, and we are united in our commitment to learn from the past and work as a team to deliver a better result,” Jamil added.Hopefully they will be able to do that because Coyle, despite all his admiration of Jamil and JFC, is eyeing nothing but all the three points on offer.“Khalid is an excellent coach. He has shown it at a number of clubs. Jamshedpur FC have given him an opportunity that he has grabbed with both hands. For the duration of the game, we will be doing everything to win,” Coyle said.",Jamshedpur FC were humbled in their last game when they were thrashed 0-5 by Northeast United FC in Guwahati last Saturday. The former Shield winners will hope to bounce back strongly against Chennaiyin FC on Monday. The team from the South hasn’t had a great start to the tournament and is coming into the match after a loss against Punjab FC.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114917564,imgsize-31672,width-400,resizemode-4/114917564.jpg"

World number one Aryna Sabalenka secured a semi-final berth at the WTA Finals by beating Italian fourth seed Jasmine Paolini 6-3, 7-5 on Monday to stay unbeaten in the purple round-robin group.The 26-year-old is on the brink of clinching the year-end number one ranking. A win over Elena Rybakina in the final group match on Wednesday or a loss from her rival, Poland's Iga Swiatek, would seal the year-end top spot for the Belarusian.Sabalenka's win combined with Chinese Zheng Qinwen 's earlier 7-6(4) 3-6 6-1 victory over Rybakina ensured the top seed will finish first in her group regardless of her final result on Wednesday, making her the first player to reach the final four.Australian Open and U.S. Open champion Sabalenka also won her opening match in Riyadh against seventh seed Zheng. The Chinese player and Paolini, with 1-1 records, both remain in contention for the semis and meet on Wednesday.Swiatek is the only player who can overtake Sabalenka.

'One of the best'

Alexander Zverev beat fierce rival Stefanos Tsitsipas in the quarter-finals of the Paris Masters on Friday, while Holger Rune edged Alex de Minaur to keep alive his hopes of reaching the ATP Tour Finals .Zverev's 7-5, 6-4 win over Tsitsipas kept him in the running to claim his first title in Paris after losing to Daniil Medvedev in the 2020 championship match.World number three Zverev -- the highest-ranked player left in the draw -- will face 2022 champion Rune in Saturday's semi-final after the Dane overcame De Minaur 6-4, 4-6, 7-5.The 16th meeting between the 27-year-old German and 26-year-old Greek was evenly matched during a hard-fought first set.""At the beginning, he was outplaying me but then I found my rhythm from the baseline,"" said Zverev on court.""And when I had my chance I used it in the first set.""Indeed once Zverev broke late in the opener and early in the second, it became a comfortable ride to just his sixth win against his long-time Greek rival.The loss ends the chances of the world number 11 Tsitsipas of reaching the end-of-year ATP Finals -- having won the showpiece event in 2019.Tsitsipas and Zverev started cautiously with both offering up opportunities for early breaks in their first service games.But they soon found their range as the first set looked destined to require a tie-break to separate the pair on the quick surface at Paris' Bercy Arena.However, the first break points of the match eventually came with Tsitsipas serving at 5-5, the German claiming the second on a double fault.The Greek saved two set points and secured a break-back point of his own but Zverev dug in to hold.Tsitsipas' shoulders visibly sagged as he offered up break point after break point at 1-1 in the second set.When he dragged a shot long to end a game which had lasted over 15 minutes, his opponent had firmly taken the ascendancy.Zverev, who reached the French Open final in Paris this year, served out to win and move towards a second ATP 1000-level trophy of the season.Former world number four Rune, the 13th seed, needed just one break of serve as he took the opener against De Minaur.In the second set, the 25-year-old Australian started to open up on his groundstrokes, producing several stunning winners off both wings.Rune finally relented when serving at 4-5, offering up three set points to De Minaur who duly converted the second with aplomb.The Australian's first serve gradually deserted him in the decider and Rune capitalised by breaking in the fifth game, but De Minaur struck immediately back to level.A huge net cord that clipped the line on the right side of the court for Rune gave him a 15-0 lead and he took full advantage, breaking to lead 6-5 before consolidating to win the match.""Sascha (Zverev) and I had a great match in Paris, where he took it in five. I beat him one time, he took me last time,"" Rune said of facing Zverev who came out on top when the pair met in a five-set clash in the last 16 of the French Open this year.""He is one of the best players this year, so I will have to be very well prepared.""With the result, both Rune and De Minaur still have a chance of reaching the Tour Finals in Turin, which run November 10-17.Frenchman Ugo Humbert , who downed world number two Carlos Alcaraz in the last 16, delighted the vocal home crowd by beating unseeded Australian Jordan Thompson 6-2, 7-6 (7/4).The world number 18 will face Russian Karen Khachanov in the other semi-final as he attempts to reach a first Masters final of his career and emulate Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in becoming the first French winner in Paris since 2008.Khachanov, the 2018 Paris Masters champion, defeated last year's runner-up Grigor Dimitrov 6-2, 6-3, ending the 33-year-old Bulgarian's hopes of reaching Turin in the process.","Alexander Zverev beats Stefanos Tsitsipas 7-5, 6-4 in Paris Masters quarter- final.
