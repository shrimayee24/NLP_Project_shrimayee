IND Pace Attack Will Be Over Reliant On Jasprit Bumrah During #BGT in AUS

NEW DELHI: India A endured a disastrous start to their second unofficial Test against Australia A at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Thursday, losing four wickets inside three overs, including veteran batter KL Rahul for just 4 runs.All eyes were on Rahul’s form ahead of the upcoming Border-Gavaskar Trophy , but the 32-year-old failed to make an impact after being promoted to the top of the order.Opening alongside Abhimanyu Easwaran , Rahul was dismissed by Scott Boland, caught behind after edging the fourth ball he faced. His wicket left India struggling at 9/3 in just 1.3 overs.India's top order had already crumbled before Rahul’s dismissal, as Australia A pacer Michael Neser struck twice in the first over. Neser removed Easwaran and Sai Sudharsan with back-to-back deliveries, reducing India to 0/2 in 0.4 overs.Neser claimed his third wicket shortly after, sending India A captain Ruturaj Gaikwad back to the pavilion for 4, leaving the visitors reeling at 11/4 inside the first three overs.Rahul’s inclusion in the India A side was aimed at preparing him for the Border-Gavaskar series starting November 22 in Perth.With speculation that India’s regular captain Rohit Sharma may miss the first Test for personal reasons, Rahul is competing with Easwaran for an opening spot. Easwaran’s place in the squad follows a series of strong performances in domestic cricket.After opting to bowl first, Australia A’s pace duo of Neser and Boland wreaked havoc on India A’s top order, putting the visitors under immense pressure from the outset.The second unofficial Test continues as India A seek to recover from their early collapse.","India A lose four wickets inside three overs in second unofficial Test against Australia A.

Aussie great & ex-India coach pens letter to faltering batting talent, says Mumbai axing could become turning point of his career

MUMBAI: Troubled batting talent Prithvi Shaw , once touted as the next big thing but now down and out in his career and dropped even from Mumbai's Ranji Trophy squad , has found support from an unlikely corner - Greg Chappell , former India coach and ex-Australia captain.Disturbed by the downswing in Prithvi's fortunes, Chappell has written a heartfelt letter to the 24-year-old cricketer (TOI has a copy) reminding him how career lows can turn into turning points.""Hi Prithvi, I understand you're facing a challenging time right now, being out of the Mumbai team. It's natural to feel frustrated and perhaps a bit uncertain, but I want you to know that these moments are often the turning points for athletes, helping to shape both their careers and their character.""I remember watching you play for India's under-19 team, where you showcased an extraordinary talent and a spark that made it clear you were among the most exciting young cricketers of your time. Those of us who recognize your potential are still keenly watching your journey, knowing that the best is yet to come,"" Chappell wrote in the letter.Shaw, who has played five Tests, scored a hundred on debut against West Indies back in Nov 2018 in Rajkot but thereafter fell by the wayside because of alleged disciplinary issues. This season, he was dropped from Mumbai's Ranji Trophy team on grounds of ""poor fitness"". He has been given a fitness programme to follow by the Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) in order to shed excess weight.In the letter, Chappell , who scored 7110 runs in 87 Tests with 24 hundreds, cited examples of Don Bradman and even himself as cricketers who were dropped but then fought their way back.""Remember, setbacks are a part of every great athlete's story. Even legends like Don Bradman experienced being dropped and having to fight their way back. What made them great was not avoiding challenges, but how they responded to them. In my own career, being dropped was one of the most humbling yet valuable experiences.""It forced me to review every aspect of my game and, more importantly, my approach.""I learned that my attitude, resilience, and willingness to improve mattered more than raw talent alone. I realized that I often got myself out by letting distractions or self-doubt interfere, and that wasn't going to change unless I took full responsibility,"" Chappell wrote in his letter.The cricketing great recalled that he realized after being dropped that he needed to ""focus on one ball at a time, stay in the present, focus on process rather than results,"" and asked Shaw to take a similar journey of ""self-reflection"".""So I made a commitment to myself: I'd focus on one ball at a time, really seeing each delivery, and responding in the moment. I trained not just for skill, but to strengthen my mindset, learning to judge my practice sessions by how well I stayed present and focused on each ball.""That shift - from results-focused to process-focused - transformed my approach to both practice and games. I encourage you to take a similar journey of self-reflection. It's easy to blame circumstances, but ultimately, your response to these challenges will define your path. Elite athletes know that discipline and sacrifice are essential. It's about honing not just your physical game, but your lifestyle, from diet to fitness, with the understanding that the pain of discipline is far less than the pain of regret,"" Chappell wrote.Chappell advised Shaw that he could still make a comeback into the Indian team, but for that, he must show a ""commitment to growth and change"".""The past doesn't define you, Prithvi. It's what you do from here that matters. You're still in your prime, with so many years ahead to make your mark. Take this time to visualize the cricketer and person you want to become. Surround yourself with people who inspire you to improve.""Take care of your body, get the right amount of rest, and build the strength and focus you need. The door back to the Indian team is open if you're willing to walk through it, but it takes a commitment to growth and change,"" the 76-year-old wrote.Chappell rounded off his letter to Shaw by stressing that he and ""many others still believe in you"" and offered to help him in case the Mumbaikar wanted to reach out to him.""Know that I - and many others - believe in you and are here to support your journey back to the top. If there's ever a way I can help or if you have questions, don't hesitate to reach out. You have everything within you to reach your full potential. Wishing you all the best on this journey. Regards, Greg,"" Chappell said.","Greg Chappell pens letter to Prithvi Shaw, former India coach and ex-Australia captain.

WATCH:

A bizarre incident unfolded during the third ODI between West Indies and England at Kensington Oval , Barbados, when West Indies pacer Alzarri Joseph unexpectedly left the field mid-match after a disagreement with captain Shai Hope . The incident occurred early in the innings after Joseph bowled his second over, despite taking a wicket in it.The disagreement began after the first delivery of Joseph's over, when he and Hope had an extended discussion about field placement. England were at 10/1, and Joseph appeared frustrated with the field setup, specifically pointing toward the slips in visible frustration.Despite the apparent tension, Joseph continued to bowl and delivered a 148.2 kph short ball, which resulted in the dismissal of England's Jordan Cox , who gloved the ball to the wicketkeeper. However, rather than celebrating the wicket, Joseph left the field without speaking to Hope after completing a wicket-maiden.West Indies coach Darren Sammy attempted to calm Joseph outside the boundary, but the fast bowler remained adamant and went to sit in the dugout. After a brief sit-out, Joseph rejoined the match without further incident, but he resumed bowling later in the 12th over only.Joseph finished with figures of 2 for 45 in his 10 overs, as England posted 263/8 in their 50 overs.The unusual episode did not affect West Indies' overall performance, as they cruised to an eight-wicket victory. Keacy Carty (128*), and Evin Lewis (102) led the successful run chase, reaching the target with 42 balls to spare, sealing a series win for the hosts.The incident between Joseph and Hope remains a talking point, but the West Indies’ dominant performance overshadowed the controversy on the field.","Alzarri Joseph left the field after a disagreement with captain Shai Hope.

BENGALURU: Aging legs and aching limbs have not been kind to wicketkeeper-bat Wriddhiman Saha . The 40-year-old, who has featured in 40 Test matches for the country, earlier this week, announced he would retire after the ongoing Ranji Trophy season.If he had his way, he would have called time on his 17-year-old career at the start of the season. His wife Romi and his former skipper Sourav Ganguly persuaded him to change his decision.Saha, who shifted allegiance to Tripura for two seasons, returned to the Bengal fold in August, said here on Wednesday, ""I wasn't going to play this year, since I played for Tripura. Sourav and my wife pushed me to sign off from Bengal this year. Due to my body condition and injuries, I won't be able to play all formats in the season. So, I've chosen to play in the most vital format. It will be tough (physically), but I want to play well and help my team qualify for the final.""As a result of Saha's career overlapping with that of Mahendra Singh Dhoni , his opportunities were limited. Yet, the seasoned player is a content man.Drawing a parallel with a few other careers, Saha pointed out, ""There are a lot of cricketers, like Amol Muzumdar , who did not get a chance to play for India even after playing for so many years. There is Padmakar Shivalkar sir too. I don't feel unlucky, instead, I feel fortunate and proud that I have played 40 Tests"".Asked how he came to terms with the Indian team moving on from him after the Test match against New Zealand in Mumbai in 2021, Saha explained, ""Rahul (Dravid) bhai told me what could have been a team management decision. I did not get demoralised by it because it was their decision. Mine was to continue playing domestic cricket and IPL , which I have over the past three years.""Post-retirement, Saha is keen on coaching. ""I want to share as much knowledge as I have. If I get an offer from Bengal or any other state team, I'll consider it.""","Wicketkeeper-bat Wriddhiman Saha announced he would retire after the ongoing Ranji Trophy season.

IND Pace Attack Will Be Over Reliant On Jasprit Bumrah During #BGT in AUS

NEW DELHI: Former Australian captain Michael Clarke has shared his thoughts on the Indian cricket team's recent performances against New Zealand. Clarke believes that the team's demanding schedule has contributed to their recent struggles.“Take nothing away from New Zealand, but it tells me India are so fatigued. Some of their shot selection, the use of bowlers, and even Rohit saying he wasn’t at his best—it’s mental fatigue. They’ve played so much cricket without a break,” Clarke said on the Around the Wicket podcast.Despite his observations about their fatigue, Clarke remains optimistic about India's prospects in the upcoming Border-Gavaskar series in Australia. He believes that key players like Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma , once well-rested, will lead the team to a strong performance.“They know they’ve played well out here in Australia and they’ll still come here with plenty of talent and that self-belief,” Clarke added.Meanwhile, former Australian captain Aaron Finch has expressed his disagreement with Indian cricket legend Sunil Gavaskar 's views on India's captaincy. The discussion revolves around the possibility of current Indian captain Rohit Sharma missing the first Test, or even the first two Tests, of the series due to personal reasons.Gavaskar had suggested that in Rohit's absence, the team's vice-captain, Jasprit Bumrah , should captain India for the entire series to maintain continuity. Gavaskar believes it would be more beneficial for Bumrah to lead throughout the series rather than having Rohit take over mid-series upon his return.Finch, speaking on the Around the Wicket podcast, disagreed with Gavaskar's perspective.“I disagree with Sunny on that totally. Rohit Sharma is the captain of the Indian cricket team. If you need to stay at home because your wife’s going to have a baby… that’s such a beautiful moment, and you take all the time that you need in that regard,"" Finch said.The much-anticipated Border-Gavaskar series, consisting of five Test matches between India and Australia, is scheduled to commence on November 22.",Former Australian captain Michael Clarke believes India's recent performances have been down to mental fatigue.

NEW DELHI: 1983 World Cup winner Sandeep Patil on Wednesday described India's recent series loss to New Zealand as a 'wake-up call', urging the team to leave the past behind as they gear up for the upcoming Australia tour.Patil emphasized that India must learn from their mistakes in order to compete effectively on Australian soil, where conditions and the quality of the opposition present unique challenges. Rohit Sharma 's Indian team will soon arrive in Australia with their pride on the line, following a 0-3 series loss to New Zealand at home that has disrupted their World Test Championship plans.As Team India aims to regroup and deliver a strong performance in the five-Test series, former selector and ex-cricketer Patil expressed confidence in the team’s ability to bounce back.Patil believes the squad is talented and resilient enough to overcome recent setbacks and refocus on achieving success in challenging Australian conditions.""They have to play against Australia in Australia, they will have to forget what happened there last time. They will also have to forget what happened in this series (against New Zealand) and look forward,"" said Patil during the launch of his book titled 'Beyond Boundaries '.""We lost all practice games before winning the World Cup, so they should remember... you have to think positive and play positively only then you will get a positive result,"" he said.""If you play defensive cricket and think of winning, it is not going to happen,"" he added.However, Patil noted that the historic series whitewash by New Zealand serves as a wake-up call for Indian cricket.""This (series loss) was like a wake-up call. It's not like our team has been playing badly. A few months back they won the T20 World Cup. There are some big players in our team, surely they will bounce back,"" he said.""They must have learnt so many things from this loss,"" he added.Patil expressed confidence in India's ability to recover strongly, emphasising their consistent pattern of resurgence after setbacks.""After every defeat, you have always seen the Indian team bouncing back. Not because I am an Indian and we all are Indians, but they will bounce back because they are a very good side,"" he stated.Regarding the Perth pitch, Patil noted its evolution from its previous characteristics, whilst highlighting the generally favourable batting conditions in Australian grounds.""Perth back then was a fast wicket, it is not the same anymore. Australian wickets are basically batting-friendly wickets,"" he observed.He addressed the recent series loss against New Zealand, attributing it to underwhelming batting performances rather than outright failure.""We lost the series (against New Zealand) because the batting didn't do well. I will not use the word 'failed' because it is negative. We just did not do well in the batting department.""""We have Virat Kohli , Rohit Sharma, Shubman Gill and so many (other) great players.

Jofra Archer contributed significantly with his 17-ball unbeaten blitz producing 38 runs towards the end of the innings.But Archer's bowling left a lot to be desired, as Carty (128 not out) scored his maiden international century whilst King (102) registered his third ODI ton. Their substantial second-wicket partnership of 209 runs ensured a comfortable victory for the West Indies.The teams will face each other again in a T20I series starting Saturday at Barbados' Kensington Oval, with Jos Buttler potentially returning from injury to lead the English side.For England, Liam Livingstone, who had scored his first ODI century to level the series in the second match on Saturday, was amongst four early dismissals within the first 10 overs. Salt's partnership with Sam Curran (40) and Dan Mousley's (57) first ODI fifty helped stabilise England's innings.The hosts faced a setback when Romario Shepherd sustained an injury mid-spell, forcing Sherfane Rutherford to bowl. England capitalised on this situation, particularly through Archer's aggressive batting, scoring 57 runs off Rutherford's 3.5 overs. Jamie Overton also played a cameo of 32 off 21 balls.Overton dismissed Evin Lewis for 19 to hit Windies' chase early, but the formidable stand between King and Carty dashed the visitors' aspirations. The remarkable partnership marked only the third instance in West Indies ODI history where a duo amassed over 200 runs in a home fixture.King's innings concluded when Reece Topley clean bowled him, but by then the damage had been done. Carty, who emerged as the series' leading run-getter, fittingly sealed the triumph with a boundary.The defeat marked England's third consecutive ODI series loss following their underwhelming World Cup campaign in India last year.",West Indies beat England by eight wickets in third ODI at Barbados.

#INDvsNZ: Rohit Sharma and Co. Need to Stop Playing On Raging Turners At Home

That beautiful June afternoon in Barbados now seems a million miles away. Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli - the two best Indian batters of this generation - had just realized their long-cherished dream of winning a World Cup together. Immediately after India's title-winning run, they proceeded to announce their T20 retirements in a span of half-an-hour, but you could see both were hopeful about a bright couple of years ahead in the other two formats.Just five months on, though, the cutthroat quality of international cricket has reminded the two champions that life can be cruel. Little did they know on June 29 that India would be departing for the five-Test series in Australia with little or no hope of making the World Test Championship final, and that there would be serious question marks over their futures.From a World Cup-winning captain, Rohit has now become the first Indian skipper to suffer a whitewash at home in Tests. Virat is in the middle of a most dismal year in red-ball cricket, with 250 runs from six games at an average of 22.72.Virat turned 36 on Tuesday and it's an age when a tour of Australia can be really challenging. We have seen some great careers coming to an end in Australia - from Dilip Vengsarkar and VVS Laxman to Rahul Dravid - and all those who have loved the Delhi cricketer for so long wouldn't want a similar story to pan out over the next couple of months.Former India captain Krishnamachari Srikkanth, who also finished his Test career in Australia in 1992, is hopeful that Virat will weather the storm. ""The best thing about Virat is the determination and the hunger to achieve more. Add to that his enviable record in Australia and I think he will bounce back strongly from this debacle against New Zealand,"" Srikkanth told TOI.Virat's first Test century came in Adelaide during the 2011-12 series and since then, the modern master has added five more to his kitty Down Under. ""The bounce from the pitches in Australia isn't something that should bother Virat. In fact, he is probably at his best against the short ball, and the fact that he is extremely fit gives him a good chance to succeed,"" Srikkanth said, adding that he believes Virat still has a couple of years of Test cricket left in him.The situation, probably, isn't as straight forward for Rohit. Just 91 runs from three Tests against New Zealand is as bad as it can be, and it's the nature of dismissals that's going to worry the skipper more than anything else.It's the pacers who dismissed Rohit four out of six times in the New Zealand series where spinners called all the shots barring the first innings in Bengaluru. The way he was hurried on to mistiming his favourite pull-shot in both the innings at Wankhede would surely leave the right-hander a worried man going to Australia.While Srikkanth said on his YouTube channel that Rohit may pull the curtains down on his Test career if he doesn't do well in Australia, he went into a deeper analysis of what the captain needs to do as a batter if he has to succeed in the Border Gavaskar Trophy .""I also had a similar batting style to Rohit, I mean a bit of a dasher. What experience taught me is that even if you are an attacking opener, it is important to give yourself a little more time in the middle, especially in Australia, before going for the shots,"" Srikkanth, who was the chairman of selectors when the 2011-12 debacle in Australia happened, said.What complicates things just a little more for Rohit is that he is the captain of the side. If the team doesn't do well, all the pressure will come on him and the Australians will look to feed on that. They will look to keep the captain down because that can pull the entire Indian team down, a thing that Rohit has to guard against. Sunil Gavaskar, in fact, has suggested that if Rohit doesn't lead the team in the first Test due to personal reasons, the captaincy for the entire series should be given to Jasprit Bumrah Srikkanth didn't want to get into that debate, but he wants Rohit to be cautious about the fact that ""your strength can sometimes turn into your weakness in Australia"".""The Aussies have seen that Rohit isn't at his best with the pull shot early on in his innings. They are going to bowl slightly short at a good pace on bouncy tracks to Rohit, asking him to go for his favourite stroke. All Rohit needs to do is to be slightly careful and he has the talent to manage it from there,"" Srikkanth said.That's what all of us want. It's on Rohit and Virat to justify the belief and keep the Indian flag flying Down Under.","Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli will probably feature on their last tour of Australia.

European heavyweights Real Madrid and Manchester City both suffered big defeats in the Champions League on Tuesday.Defending champions Madrid were humbled 3-1 at home by AC Milan , while Erling Haaland missed a penalty and City squandered a fourth-minute lead as they lost 4-1 at Sporting Lisbon , whose coach will soon take charge of its crosstown rival.It was a much better evening for Liverpool , as Luis Diaz scored a hat trick and Cody Gakpo grabbed another goal in a 4-0 win over German champion Bayer Leverkusen at Anfield that marred Xabi Alonso’s return to his old home.The Leverkusen coach was given a warm welcome on his return to the club where he became a fan favorite as a player over five seasons between 2004-09. Alonso won the Champions League with Liverpool in 2005.Liverpool moved to the top of the league phase table with four wins from four games, followed by Sporting and Monaco, both on 10 points after three wins and a draw. Under the new 36-team format introduced by UEFA this season, the top eight teams advance directly to the next round, and those from ninth to 24th enter playoffs to reach it, while the bottom 12 are eliminated.Before their game, Sporting fans displayed a huge tifo thanking Ruben Amorim in his last home game before he takes over Manchester United.Phil Foden then got City off to a flying start in the fourth minute, only the second goal Sporting have conceded in four games of the competition.But Swedish forward Viktor Gyokeres scored a hat trick as Sporting came roaring back. Gyokeres first equalized in the 38th after a perfect through ball from Geovany Quenda, before Maximiliano Araújo made it 2-1 right after the break. Gyokeres then made it 3-1 from the penalty spot after Josko Gvardiol was penalized for a shove on Francisco Trincão in the area.Haaland’s penalty hit the crossbar, before Gyökeres showed the Norwegian how it’s done with another spot kick at the other end to complete the scoring.It is the first time since 2018 that City have lost three straight games, coming off a defeat to Tottenham in the English League Cup and a loss to Bournemouth in the Premier League.“In my seven and a half years at the club, I don't remember losing three games in a row,” City midfielder Bernardo Silva said.In Spain, Christian Pulisic sent in a corner for Malick Thiaw to head Milan into a 12th-minute lead, ensuring Madrid trailed in a third straight game in the Champions League this season. The 15-time champions had already lost to surprise team Lille in their second game.Vinícius Júnior equalized from the penalty spot in the 23rd after he’d been tripped, but Álvaro Morata pounced on the rebound after Andriy Lunin saved Rafael Leão’s shot to restore the visitors’ lead against his former club.Morata had already been given a hostile reception from the home fans, who evidently remember the goal he scored to take Juventus through to the 2015 final at their team’s expense.Tijjani Reijnders scored Milan’s third goal as the home fans made their frustrations known at Santiago Bernabéu Stadium.“The last two defeats are inexplicable. We have to analyze and react quickly,"" Lunin said, referring to Madrid's 4-0 loss to Barcelona in their previous Spanish league game.It's the first time since 2009 that Madrid have lost two successive games at home with at least three goals conceded in each, according to Opta.“We have to get back on track,” Lunin said.German forward Nicolas Kuhn scored twice as Celtic defeated Leipzig 3-1 at home, and Juventus drew 1-1 at Lille.Lille midfielder Edon Zhegrova eluded two defenders before playing a perfect pass for Jonathan David, who fired inside the far post, but Dusan Vlahovic equalized with a penalty for the Italian club.Donyell Malen scored late for Borussia Dortmund to beat Sturm Graz 1-0 at home, and Thilo Kehrer did likewise for Monaco to win at Bologna 1-0.United States midfielder Malik Tillman scored one goal and set up another as PSV Eindhoven beat Spanish team Girona 4-0.Dinamo Zagreb dealt Slovan Bratislava their fourth straight defeat in the competition as the visitors came from behind to win 4-1 in Bratislava.",Real Madrid lose 3-1 at home to AC Milan.

IND Pace Attack Will Be Over Reliant On Jasprit Bumrah During #BGT in AUS

Afghanistan secured a comfortable victory in the first One-Day International against Bangladesh, winning by 92 runs on Wednesday. The star of the show was Afghanistan's 18-year-old spinner, Allah Ghazanfar, who recorded career-best figures of 6-26.Ghazanfar's impressive performance effectively dismantled Bangladesh's middle and lower order. At one stage, Bangladesh seemed well-placed to chase down Afghanistan's total of 235, reaching 132/3. However, Ghazanfar's devastating spell saw them collapse to 143 all out.Ghazanfar's figures of 6-26 are now the best by any bowler in ODIs between Bangladesh and Afghanistan, surpassing Shakib Al Hasan 's 5-29 in 2019.The two teams will play the second and third ODIs, scheduled for November 9 and 11 in Sharjah.Earlier in the match, Afghanistan found themselves struggling at 35/4 after opted to bat first. Captain Hashmatullah Shahidi (52) and the experienced Mohammad Nabi (84) steadied the innings with a crucial 104-run partnership for the sixth wicket. Despite their efforts, Afghanistan were eventually bowled out for 235 in 49.4 overs. Bangladesh's pace duo of Taskin Ahmed and Mustafizur Rahman were the pick of the bowlers, both finishing with four wickets each.Bangladesh's reply began confidently, with opener Soumya Sarkar scoring 33. Najmul Hossain Shanto top-scored with 47, while Mehidy Hasan contributed 28. However, the dismissal of Najmul by Nabi, with the score at 132, triggered a dramatic collapse.Ghazanfar then took center stage, claiming the breakthrough in his fifth over by dismissing Mehidy. He followed that up by quickly dismissing Mushfiqur Rahim, Rishad Hossain, and Taskin Ahmed, effectively ending Bangladesh's hopes.Afghanistan skipper Shahidi was full of praise for the young spinner, saying, ""He is a passionate youngster who always wants to do well.""Najmul, on the other hand, felt his dismissal was the turning point in the match.""I think my wicket turned the match,"" said Najmul. ""I was the set batsman so when I got out we needed to bat longer but credit to Afghanistan spinners for the way they bowled.""",Afghanistan beat Bangladesh by 92 runs in first One-Day International. 18-year- old spinner Allah Ghazanfar takes career-best figures of 6-26.

Brief scores: Madhya Pradesh 381/4 in 88 overs (Shubham Sharma 134 batting, Venkatesh Iyer 118 batting, Rajat Patidar 45; Sachin Kumar Singh 2/137) vs Bihar. Match to continue.

Bihar fielders were sent on a leather hunt by the Madhya Pradesh batters as they reached 381/4 in 88 overs on the opening day of their fourth-round Group C Ranji Trophy encounter in Patna on Wednesday.Opting to bat first, MP captain Shubham Sharma (134 batting off 182 balls) and Venkatesh Iyer (118 batting off 113 balls) both scored unbeaten centuries to lead the onslaught against the Bihar bowlers who looked quite helpless despite playing at home.Shubham, who had scored an unbeaten 143 against Karnataka, was back to his best after missing out in the last match against Haryana and played a patient knock that included 11 fours and one six. He came to the middle after the dismissal of Himanshu Mantri and initially shared a 16-run partnership with Rajat Patidar. Once Patidar was dismissed, he joined hands with Harpreet Singh Bhatia.However, Bhatia didn’t last long either and Iyer joined his skipper in the middle in the 45th over and for the next 43 overs the duo went after the Bihar bowlers.Kolkata Knight Riders all-rounder Iyer especially was in a belligerent mood from the very word go as he hit 11 fours and four over boundaries.He took a special liking towards Sachin Kumar Singh off whom he scored 46 runs. By the end of the day the duo amassed 234 runs off 260 balls and will look to add some quick runs on the second day to make sure the Bihar batters has a mountain to climb.As for the Bihar bowlers, they have a huge task at hand after being taken to the cleaners on the opening day. Himanshu Singh, who had been Bihar’s most successful bowler so far in the tournament, was able to get just one wicket of Harpreet in his 25 overs by giving away 111 runs.Sachin, meanwhile, was the most successful bowler for Bihar on the day as he returned figures of 2/137 in 30 overs. Shabbir Khan was the other wicket taker for the hosts as he removed the dangerous Patidar in the 33rd over.Despite such a lopsided scorecard, the hosts had begun quite well earlier in the day and reduced Madhya Pradesh to 37/1 by sending Yash Dubey back to the pavilion in 16th over.Even though the runs kept coming, Bihar kept taking wickets at regular intervals to reduce MP to 147 for 4.After that though it was a Shubham-Iyer show which the Bihar players could only watch on.",Madhya Pradesh reached 381/4 in 88 overs on the opening day of their Group C Ranji Trophy encounter in Patna.

MUMBAI: Sandeep Patil , former India player and one-time chairman of the selection committee, said on Wednesday that the 3-0 series defeat against New Zealand needs to be a “wake-up call” for the Indian team. However, he backed them to come good in the five-Test Border Gavaskar Trophy against Australia starting Nov 22.“Unfortunately, we’ve lost the series against New Zealand. But I’m sure they must have learnt so many things from this loss. I hope they repeat their performance of 2020-2021. This series loss was like a wake-up call. It’s not like our team has been playing badly. Few months back they won the T20 World Cup. There are some big players in our team and surely, they will bounce back,” said Patil, who was part of the Indian team that won the 1983 World Cup.A dashing batter in his prime, Patil added that the current team can take a cue from the 1983 World Cup triumph, a campaign which didn’t start on a great note. “We lost all practice games before winning the World Cup, so they should remember that. You must think positive and play positively, only then you will get a positive result. If you play defensive cricket and think of winning, it is not going to happen,” Patil said on the sidelines of the launch of his book ‘Beyond Boundaries’ at the CCI on Wednesday.After the defeat against the Black Caps, the entire focus has shifted to how India will fare against Australia and which Indian team will turn-up when the first Test kicks off in Perth on Nov 22. Patil said that they must forget about what happened in the last series against Australia, or the recent one against New Zealand, and instead focus on the job ahead.He also said the Australian pitches would suit India: “Australian wickets are basically batting-friendly wickets. We lost the series to New Zealand because the batting didn’t do well. I will not use the word failed because it is negative. We did not do well in the batting department. We have Virat Kohli Rohit Sharma , Shubman Gill and so many other good players. I’m sure they would have got together and talked about it.”There are murmurs about phasing out seniors like Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli and R Ashwin. Patil, who headed the selection committee that phased out many seniors including Sachin Tendulkar, said that’s part and parcel of the game.“The decisions we took were not because we hated someone or liked someone. We were looking at the future of Indian cricket. And after our term was over, the Indian team did extremely well. The new generation which replaced the earlier players did very well. The transition talk happens with every selector. There was talk of transition even when I played. Sunil Gavaskar retired, what will happen? Sachin Tendulkar retired, what will happen? Now there is talk about Rohit Sharma. Transition will go on, it’s part of cricket. You must look at the future.”",Former India player Sandeep Patil says the 3-0 series defeat against New Zealand needs to be a “wake-up call” for the Indian team.

Who Can RCB Get?! 🏏 360 Show S06E08

NEW DELHI: With the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025 mega auction approaching, former South African cricketer AB de Villiers has shared some bold and intriguing insights about Royal Challengers Bengaluru's (RCB) strategy.The franchise has retained Virat Kohli, Rajat Patidar, and uncapped pacer Yash Dayal, keeping Rs 83 crore available for auction, which gives RCB substantial flexibility.De Villiers believes that RCB’s retention choices set a solid base and sees potential for the team to acquire impactful players who could make RCB a title contender.“The good news is we still have Virat. And we didn’t spend too much with the retentions. There’s a lot in the bank still, which I’m very happy about,” de Villiers remarked on his YouTube channel.Kohli’s consistency and leadership are the backbone of RCB, with his impressive 2024 season where he scored 741 runs at a strike rate of 154.70 earning him the Orange Cap.But, according to de Villiers, Kohli alone isn’t enough; the squad needs more players with skills tailored for Chinnaswamy Stadium.De Villiers sees leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal as a priority: “Let’s just get Yuzi back at RCB where he belongs. He should never have left.”He also suggested a robust bowling unit, ideally including Chahal, Kagiso Rabada , and Ravichandran Ashwin.“We’re talking about a tournament-winning attack there,” he added.Additionally, de Villiers suggested Bhuvneshwar Kumar as an option if Rabada isn’t available, highlighting his vision for a versatile, street-smart team that can excel on the home ground.""My four priority players are Yuzvendra Chahal, Kagiso Rabada, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, and Ravi Ashwin. We can make a plan with the rest of the money we have left in the auction. If you can't get Rabada, I get hold of Mohammed Shami. If you can't get him, get hold of Arshdeep Singh . So there's lots of options,"" he further added.“We don't need a trophy. Forget about the trophy. We need a team that understands the Chinnaswamy, who are street smart, who can bowl to plans, who can play to plans, who has got a very good understanding about the game of cricket ,” de Villiers noted.With a calculated mix of spin, pace, and experience, RCB’s potential auction strategy could be groundbreaking. As de Villiers suggests, RCB has a strong chance to build a winning formula with the right investments.","Royal Challengers Bengaluru have retained Virat Kohli, Rajat Patidar, and uncapped pacer Yash Dayal, keeping Rs 83 crore available for auction.

Despite fine batting performances by Tamil Nadu batters C Andre Siddharth and Vijay Shankar , hosts Assam restricted their much-fancied opponents to 299 for seven with some disciplined bowling in Guwahati on Wednesday.Fortune swayed in favour of both sides throughout the opening day of the fourth-round match of Ranji Trophy Elite Group D, which saw Assam starting on a fine note returning both Tamil Nadu openers Suresh Lokeshwar and Narayan Jagadeesan for only 13 runs on board in the third over after opting to field first.Medium pacer Darshan Rajbongshi gave Assam the first breakthrough dismissing Lokeshwar while his new-ball partner Mukhtar Hussain accounted for wicketkeeper-batter Jagadeesan. Rajbongshi then returned former India A player Pradosh Ranjan Paul, who threw away a fine start of 27 off 40 balls as the scoreboard read 79 for three.Shankar and Siddharth then joined hands to put up 98 runs for the fourth wicket to solidify the Tamil Nadu innings before the former was castled by veteran off-spinner Swarupam Purkayastha, who was the pick of Assam bowlers returning 2/33 from his 12 overs.His tweak partner, left-arm spinner Rahul Singh, also scalped two wickets while medium pacer Rajbongshi bowled a fine spell in the first session of the day to return with 2/75.T20 specialist Shahrukh Khan (28) got a good start but failed to convert that into a big one while captain Sai Kishore (3) returned soon, too, as Tamil Nadu could not get any big partnership going after Shankar’s dismissal. Kishore lasted only 15 balls on his return from India A duty at ACC Men’s T20 Emerging Teams Asia Cup and was the last man dismissed on Day 1.Mohamed Ali (27 batting off 78 balls) and Sonu Yadav (12 batting off 30) then saw off the last 10 overs of the day as stumps were drawn after 85 overs of Tamil Nadu’s first innings.Earlier, Siddarth missed out on a well-deserved century by six runs (94 off 163 balls, 9 fours, 1 six) while Shankar followed up his hundred with a 76 at Barsapara Cricket Stadium to help Tamil Nadu reach a formidable total at the end of the day.",Assam restrict Tamil Nadu to 299 for seven in their first innings.

Since 2023, the average score in the first innings at the First Class level here is 287 and the visitors are well within the reach of that figure.The growing partnership of unbeaten 55 runs between youngsters Rahul Radesh (43 not out off 117 balls) and Ajay Dev Goud (34 not out off 60 balls) puts Hyderabad in control.On a track that assisted spin, Rajasthan fielded only one full-time spinner, Ajay Kookna. The left-arm bowler, who was introduced into the attack in the 11th over, created substantial difficulty for the batsmen with the drift and bounce that he generated.The 27-year-old spinner was the pick of the bowlers, accounting for dismissals of the three top-order Hyderabad batters. Abhirath Reddy failed to pick the length of the ball and was clean bowled at 21 off 37 balls while Tanmay Agarwal (40 off 71 balls), centurion of the last game against Pondicherry, became the victim of a premeditated paddle sweep as a thick top-edge went to Mahipal Lomror at the first slip. Later, Kookna came around the wicket to trap left-hand batsman Rohit Rayudu (21 off 75 balls) leg-before-wicket.Kookna bowled 29 overs, maximum among all the eight bowlers who rolled their arms.Reeling at 137/4, a significant contribution of 66 off 100 balls came from Hyderabad skipper Rahul Singh Gahlaut. He first collaborated with Himateja Kodimela for a 42-run partnership and then with Goud to coalesce 69 runs.Radesh, whose highest score in the previous three matches this season is 94 against Uttarakhand, has a chance to convert the good start into a big score and put his team in a commanding position.The 21-year-old left-hand batter took his time to settle down as Hyderabad scored 70 runs and lost only a wicket in the last session of the play.Hyderabad 261/5 in 88 overs (Tanmay Agarwal 40, Rahul Singh Gahlaut 66, Rahul Radesh 43 not out; Ajay Kookna 3-88) vs Rajasthan","Rajasthan fielded only one full-time spinner, Ajay Kookna.

IND Pace Attack Will Be Over Reliant On Jasprit Bumrah During #BGT in AUS

Watch Beyond the Boundary from Monday-Friday at 6:30pm IST as Times of India dives deep into the cricket action on and off the field.

The latest episode of Beyond The Boundary, which aired on November 6, featured a discussion on India's bowling attack for the Border Gavaskar Trophy . Host Chetan Narula was joined by Times of India's Sports Editor Sahil Malhotra, along with Dwaipayan Datta and Nitin Naik.The panel analysed the series setup, noting India's recent clean sweep on home soil by NZ and the potential impact on their confidence. They acknowledged the dent in India's confidence but found reassurance in the team's 12-day lead time, including 10 days of practice in Australia.Another point of discussion was the challenge posed by Australian pitches, known for their bounce. The panel highlighted that bounce generally doesn't trouble Indian batters like Virat Kohli Rohit Sharma , and Shubman Gill.The episode began by addressing India's possible over-reliance on Jasprit Bumrah . The panel considered the impact of Mohammed Shami 's absence and Siraj's recent dip in form, attributing it to a change in his run-up. There was a shared sentiment that India might face difficulties if Bumrah doesn't perform well.The discussion then shifted to the strengths of the Indian pacers. The panel highlighted the performances of Prasidh Krishna and Harshit Rana , acknowledging their potential contributions. Hardik Pandya 's omission from the squad was also a topic of conversation.The panel also speculated on India's likely bowling lineup for the first Test at Perth.

VILLA SLIDE

BAYERN AND DINAMO

NEXT UP

Barcelona and Inter Milan won again in the Champions League on Wednesday though both former title-holders are looking up in the standings toward upstart newcomer Brest.Aston Villa started the week atop the 36-team table but their winning run ended after a bizarre penalty was awarded when defender Tyrone Mings picked up the ball in the area at Club Brugge, resulting in a 1-0 loss that sent the English club plummeting to eighth place.Paris Saint-Germain , in their first season without Kylian Mbappe, trail far behind in 25th after Atletico Madrid scored in stoppage time to seal a 2-1 win for the Spanish team at Parc des Princes.Barcelona’s blistering scoring form continued in a 5-2 win at Red Star Belgrade — a seventh straight win since the start of October at a rate of four goals per game. Robert Lewandowski scored twice and has 21 this season.Inter Milan stifled Arsenal in a 1-0 win at San Siro sealed by Hakan Çalhanoğlu’s penalty in first-half stoppage time.Inter are unbeaten on 10 points and in fifth place, one below Brest who won 2-1 at Sparta Prague. The French debutants look sure to advance to the knockout phase starting in February.Atalanta won 2-0 at Stuttgart to stay unbeaten on eight points and Salzburg got their first goals and points in a 3-1 win at Feyenoord.Bayern Munich won 1-0 at home to Benfica in a game that was delayed 15 minutes by crowd congestion and then was played in a muted atmosphere because of a medical incident for a fan.Shakhtar Donetsk playmaker Heorhiy Sudakov had a fine assist and an even better goal in a 2-1 win for the Ukrainian champion against Young Boys. Shakhtar’s No. 10 showed why he is expected to be the club’s next big-money sale.Liverpool, who on Tuesday routed Bayer Leverkusen 4-0, lead the standings at the midway point of the eight-round program.Liverpool is the only team with four straight wins, while five teams have four losses. They are Leipzig, Sturm Graz, Young Boys, Red Star and Slovan Bratislava.Two Italian teams – Inter Milan and Atalanta – have yet to concede a goal in four games. Another Italian side, Bologna, is the only team with no goals scored.Villa had led the standings in the new league-phase format after three straight wins without conceding a goal — and it took a bizarre incident before goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez was eventually beaten.Mings was punished for picking up the ball when Martínez seemed to restart play with a goal kick passed forward to his teammate. Mings walked a couple steps to gather the ball with his left hand and returned to place it in the six-yard box.""It’s the biggest mistake I witnessed in my career,” Villa coach Unai Emery said. “It has only happened one time in all my life. Today.”Brugge captain Hans Vanaken placed the 52nd-minute spot-kick to Martínez's left as the World Cup-winning Argentina goalkeeper dived to his right.It was the standout result of the inaugural week of the new Champions League in September: Bayern Munich 9, Dinamo Zagreb 2.It was the first time a team had scored nine times in a game in the 32-year Champions League era, and Dinamo fired its coach two days later.Since then? Bayern lost twice, including a 4-1 rout at Barcelona, and Dinamo won twice. At the end of play Wednesday, Bayern was 17th on six points, one place below Dinamo on seven. If those placings hold until January, they meet again twice more in the knockout playoffs round.The fifth round in three weeks' time has perhaps the stellar attraction of 144 games in the league phase: Liverpool vs Real Madrid.That game on November 27 is a rematch of the 2022 and 2018 finals, both won by Madrid, and the 1981 European Cup title match that Liverpool won.There is another final rematch: Bayern Munich hosts PSG on November 26 in a repeat of the pandemic-season final played in August 2020 without fans in Lisbon.Also, sixth-place Barcelona host Brest, a fixture which might have been overlooked when the draw was made in August yet the French team is currently fourth.Only the top eight teams in January advance directly to the round of 16 in March.","Liverpool is the only team with four straight wins, while five teams have four losses.

We'll try to win ISL and play in ACL again to prove our worth: Molina,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/well-try-to-win-isl-and-play-in-acl-again-to-prove-our-worth-molina/articleshow/115000293.cms,"Mohun Bagan SG coach

On Bagan's disqualification from ACL Two

have got 22 yellow cards in just 6 games so far in this ISL. Is discipline a worry for you so early in the season?

Jose Molina loves to live in the present. This is the byword for his life.The Mohun Bagan Super Giant coach's 'weltanschauung' or world philosophy may have been influenced by a personal battle to overcome cancer 22 years ago.Even a long-term contract is not something the 54-year-old Spaniard pines for. ""For me it's a piece of paper I need to sign. I'm here because Mohun Bagan wanted me and I wanted to come. But if any one of the parties is not happy, the best thing is to shake hands and leave,"" he said rather nonchalantly.His mind is now preoccupied with the catastrophic floods back in Spain. ""I live in the north of Valencia and floods have devastated the south. All my family and friends are okay. But it's a terrible catastrophe to have happened in Spain,"" he remarked, now with a serious, somber note.Molina - a former Spanish goalkeeper who's still regarded as a hero at Atletico Madrid - is not new to Indian football. By his own admission, since guiding now defunct ATK to the 2016 ISL title, he continued to be sounded out by several Indian clubs until he said yes to Bagan's call this year.During an exclusive chat with a select media persons, including TOI, at the Mohun Bagan tent on Tuesday, Molina opened up on several key chapters of his career, from playing with the likes of Diego Simeone and Lionel Scaloni to serving the Spanish football federation as its sporting director.I was a goalkeeper but made my debut for Spain as a left-winger! During the match against Norway (a friendly held in Oslo in 1996), the coach (Javier Clemente) used up all his substitutions and when another player got injured, I was given two options - either staying on the bench or coming on as a left-winger. I played for 16 minutes. (It was) not my position but an amazing experience.My last game (he played 9 matches in all for La Roja) was also against Norway (in Euro 2000). As a goalkeeper I made a mistake and we lost 1-0. The coach (José Antonio Camacho) said after the game that I would no longer play. As a player I had to accept the coach's decision. We all make mistakes and that decision still hurts me. Because I believe that I had the talent to play for Spain longer.I was also in the 1998 World Cup squad and (Andoni) Zubizarreta was No. 1 goalkeeper. We lost the first match 3-2 to Nigeria and Zubizarreta made mistakes. But the then coach (Clemente) decided that Zubizarreta stayed in the XI. That was not the case with me in 2000.Was it the best experience for me as a player? No. Every time I win any title that is the best experience. To win the ISL in 2016, the title in the Hong Kong league (with Kitchee). These are all parts of my best experiences.That was an amazing moment. Everyone at Real Madrid was preparing to celebrate the occasion by winning that match (Copa del Rey) since it was their centenary year and they were hosting the final at Estadio Santiago Bernabéu. It was more special because of my Atletico past. Day before the final, some of my friends at Atletico came over to me and wished me luck. People still talk about that match in La Coruna.When you are a player, you never know what will happen to you in future. Simeone and Scaloni - they too didn't know their future at that time. Even I wasn't sure about my future. I live in the present. Maybe my illness has helped me understand the value of enjoying my present as much as I can.One of the first things I did as a technical director (of Spanish football) was to look for more balance in our style and the kind of players suitable for this so that we could create a winning team. Football is a constant evolution. Spain has not changed tiki-taka style. But it's a process of evolution. Tiki-taka is still there, but sometimes you need to be more direct in your approach to the game.I am not happy with the AFC's decision. I would prefer my team to play in Asia. Now, you have to forget about the AFC and focus on ISL. We'll try to win it and play in the AFC next year to prove that an Indian team can be strong in Asia tournaments as well.Not at all. The yellow cards are the referee's decisions and they can be right or wrong. But Mohun Bagan have brought me here not to win the Fair play trophy but the title. If both are achieved, it's better, but the aim is always to win the championship.","Mohun Bagan coach Jose Molina is a former Spanish goalkeeper. Molina won the Liga and Cup 'double' for Atletico Madrid in 1996 and 2002. The 54-year-old also played for Deportivo la Coruna, Real Madrid and Atletico.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115000189,imgsize-45212,width-400,resizemode-4/115000189.jpg"

JFC suffer consecutive 5-goal hammering,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/indian-super-league/top-stories/jfc-suffer-consecutive-5-goal-hammering/articleshow/114964574.cms,"It proved to be another nightmare for Jamshedpur FC at JRD Tata Sports Complex on Monday as they were made to endure a 1-5 loss to Chennaiyin FC after their five-goal defeat in the last Indian Super League game.Jamshedpur's former Shield-winning coach Owen Coyle dealt a blow on Khalid Jamil's hosts with his new wards - with youngster Irfan Yadwad playing a lead role - as the visitors climbed two spots to sixth on the ISL table even as Jamshedpur held on to their fourth position after seven games with a number of seventh round fixtures still to go.The onslaught started as early as in the sixth minute when Pratik Chaudhary, in his bid to clear a Vinci Barretto cross from the left of the box, actually made a perfect finish into his own goal to the disappointment of his helpless goalkeeper Albino Gomes.Although Vishal Yumnam was a bit wide in putting in the ball in the 20th minute, Chennaiyin were gifted their second juts two minutes later. This time, it was the pace, skill and power of Yadwad as he vindicated the trust shown in him by veteran Coyle with a defence-splitting turn in the midfield that began the build-up to his first goal. The 23-year-old then made a run into the Jamshedpur box that could not be contained by the defenders led by Jamil's go-to man and captain Ashutosh Mehta as his shot at goal took a slight deflection en route the goal.There was no respite for Jamshedpur's weary defence, and Jamil at the stands, as two minutes later, in the 24th minute, Yadwad turned provider to Connor Shields - who had been missing his first goal of the season - with a pass outside the box that the Scottish shot into the right of the goal with Mehta at the other end.There was, however, no improvement in Jamshedpur's game as every trick in Khalid's book looked to have backfired in absence of defensive talisman Stepehn Eze, missing the match with a red card in the last game at NorthEast United.The script stayed the same after the change of ends as Chaudhary lost the ball a little outside the box to a Yadwad charge at him from the left in the 54th minute. It was Wilmar Jordan Gill who landed the pass from Yadwad and with only the goalkeeper to beat, made no mistake in adding the fifth to his goal tally this season.With both Jordan Murray and Javier Siverio having a bad day in office, and Jamil's 4-4-2 formation failing to stop the visitors' march, it was only a matter of time before Chennaiyin scored again and delivered a back-to-back five-goal assault on the Men of Steel. It was Lucas Brambilla's swerving solo effort from outside the box that left Gomes in another no position for a save.The hosts, with fans already leaving the Furnace, got a consolation goal after earning a controversial penalty kick from a Yadwad hand ball in the box - that was preceded by an offside call against Jamshedpur. Veteran Murray made no mistake to send in the spot kick but it was too little to ease the team and coach Jamil's disappointment after a great start to the season.",Jamshedpur lost 1-5 to Chennaiyin FC at JRD Tata Sports Complex on Monday.

Coco Gauff posted a rare victory over Iga Swiatek to punch her ticket to the semi-finals of the WTA Finals in Riyadh on Tuesday, ensuring Aryna Sabalenka will finish the year as the world number one Swiatek, the defending champion, was in a direct battle with Sabalenka for the top spot this week but needed a win over Gauff to keep her chances alive of leapfrogging her Belarusian rival.Gauff, 20, entered the contest having lost 11 of her 12 previous meetings with Swiatek, with the American's sole victory coming in Cincinnati last year.But she turned the tables on Swiatek on Tuesday, defeating the second seed 6-3, 6-4 to make it two straight-sets wins from two round-robin matches in Riyadh this week.""It feels great. I knew going into the match that despite our head-to-head I had a lot of confidence going in,"" said Gauff, who hit 11 double faults during the one-hour 48-minute showdown.With the exception of the opening game of the match, Gauff had break point opportunities in every Swiatek service game in the first set.The American third seed made her move in game seven, breaking for 4-3, and she closed out the set with a second break of serve, taking the lead in 49 minutes.Swiatek needed six break points in a marathon third game of the second set to finally take down the Gauff serve but she couldn't consolidate her advantage.They traded breaks again, as Gauff's double-fault tally went up to double digits and Swiatek racked up the errors.It was Gauff who eventually steadied the ship, and wrapped up the victory on Swiatek's 47th unforced error of the match.Swiatek, a five-time major champion, admits her two-month break between the US Open and the WTA Finals and the fact she is playing her first tournament with her new coach Wim Fissette have made things ""a bit more tricky and different than usual"".""But I'll force myself to work even better in the next match,"" the Pole added.Earlier in the day, Barbora Krejcikova ended Jessica Pegula's chances of qualifying for the semi-finals, defeating the sixth-seeded American 6-3, 6-3.A runner-up at the WTA Finals last year, Pegula suffered her second straight-sets defeat of the week and enters her final round-robin match against Swiatek on Thursday anchoring the Orange Group with zero sets won.Eighth-seeded Krejcikova bounced back from her opening loss to Swiatek to keep her hopes of making the final four alive.""I was fighting for every ball and I felt that I really have to play my best tennis and I was trying to be really solid and trying to put as many balls to the other side as I could,"" said Krejcikova, who picked up just her 20th match win of the season.""I'm definitely proud. I had some very high parts of the season, especially winning Wimbledon, that's something indescribable. And being here in the Finals is a huge privilege. It's nice to get the win and still be part of the event.""Despite being ranked number 13 in the world, Krejcikova qualified for these WTA Finals thanks to a new rule introduced by the WTA that gave priority to a player who has won a Grand Slam this season, while maintaining a ranking between 9 and 20, over a player ranked number eight in the Race.As the reigning Wimbledon champion, Krejcikova claimed the final qualifying spot in Riyadh over world number eight Emma Navarro.Krejcikova squandered a 6-4, 3-0 lead against Swiatek in her opener two days ago and made sure there was no repeat scenario against Pegula on Tuesday.The crafty Czech fired 11 aces and broke Pegula four times to wrap up the win in 69 minutes.Both Krejcikova and Swiatek will have to wait until Thursday's matches to learn their qualification fate in Riyadh.","Coco Gauff beats Iga Swiatek 6-3, 6-4 to reach WTA Finals semi-finals.

Aryna Sabalenka was assured of the year-end World No. 1 spot in the WTA rankings for the first time when Iga Swiatek lost at the WTA Finals on Tuesday.Sabalenka, 26, was assured of finishing the season atop the WTA rankings without swinging her racket, thanks to Coco Gauff's 6-3, 6-4 win against Swiatek at the season-ending tournament in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.A year ago, in September, Sabalenka briefly displaced Swiatek at the top of the standings for the first time, but relinquished the place when the Polish player won the WTA Finals in Cancun.This time, Sabalenka was already in pole position after Swiatek took a break from competition after the US Open.The Belarussian is 56-12 this season with four titles, including the Australian and US Opens to raise her major championship total to three. Her first came at the 2023 Australian Open.Sabalenka's game is laden with powerful — if once-erratic — serve and intimidating groundstrokes; her forehand speeds at the US Open this year were higher than every other woman and man in the tournament. But lately she has added elements of touch and variety to her game.“It’s really good to have these options in your pocket. Like sometimes, you don’t feel your best on the baseline, and you can just go for a slice or a drop shot or come to the net. I mean, I’ve been always working on this variation on the court,” Sabalenka said after defeating Jessica Pegula 7-5, 7-5 in the U.S. Open final in September. “I’m really glad that I’m brave enough to use these tools.”The WTA also announced that Katerina Siniakova will finish at No. 1 in the year-end doubles rankings.
