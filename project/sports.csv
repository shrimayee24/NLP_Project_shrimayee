Theo Fleury’s post puts PM Carney’s unity message to the test



Theo Fleury’s words ignite a national debate



FULL: Prime Minister Mark Carney's first remarks after naming new cabinet ministers

Canadian hockey great Theo Fleury isn’t mincing words when it comes to the country's new leadership. The Stanley Cup champion and longtime Calgary Flames winger stirred up a political firestorm this week after taking a sharp jab at newly appointed Prime Minister Mark Carney . His message was brief, bold, and impossible to ignore: “Not my PM.”The comment, posted to X (formerly Twitter), came just hours after Carney delivered his inaugural address promising to represent all Canadians and bridge political divides.Mark Carney, Canada’s 25th Prime Minister, officially stepped into office in March and recently introduced his first cabinet—a 24-member team that includes 15 full ministers and 9 secretaries of state. The new government has emphasized inclusion and national healing, but Fleury’s reaction paints a starkly different picture of how some Canadians feel.While Carney called for unity, Fleury tapped into a wave of discontent that has been simmering across the nation. With his concise yet pointed post, the former NHL star made it clear that not everyone is on board with the country’s current direction, highlighting deep divisions and frustration felt by many citizens.Once known for his relentless hustle on the ice, Fleury has reinvented himself as a fierce and often polarizing voice in Canadian political circles. Over the past few years, he’s been outspoken on issues ranging from government overreach to freedom of speech, and this latest post is just another example of his no-holds-barred commentary. His blunt approach continues to resonate strongly with those dissatisfied with the political establishment.Supporters say Fleury is expressing frustrations many Canadians are afraid to voice, applauding him for standing his ground. Critics, however, argue that his high-profile platform adds fuel to an already divided landscape, questioning whether athletes-turned-activists help or harm public discourse.Regardless of which side you're on, Fleury's post has once again proven one thing, when he speaks, people pay attention. His legacy on the ice may be etched in history, but his impact off it, especially in the political arena is only growing louder.Also Read: Sergei Bobrovsky under fire as Panthers rely on defense, not their $10M goalie As Mark Carney begins his journey as Prime Minister of Canada , he faces not only economic and social challenges but also the growing distrust of prominent Canadians like Fleury. With issues such as inflation, unemployment, and climate policy at the forefront, the question now is: can he win over the skeptics, rebuild public trust, and unite the country, or is this just the start of a deeper national divide fueled by political polarization and economic uncertainty? The coming months will reveal whether his leadership can bridge these divides and guide Canada toward stability and growth.","Theo Fleury stirred up a political firestorm this week after taking a sharp jab at newly appointed Prime Minister Mark Carney.

Who is Brock Purdy's wife Jenna Brandt?



Brock Purdy ’s NFL journey is nothing short of remarkable. Once labeled “Mr. Irrelevant” as the final pick of the 2022 draft, Purdy has silenced critics with his poise and performance, even reaching Super Bowl LVIII. Now, he’s set to become one of the league’s top earners. On Friday, he inked a five-year, $265 million deal with the San Francisco 49ers—$165 million of which will come in just the first three years. It's a massive leap for a player many doubted. 2024 also marks another personal milestone for Purdy, as he tied the knot with longtime girlfriend Jenna Brandt , starting a fresh chapter both on and off the field.Brock Purdy may be known as the poised and promising quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers , but off the field, his heart belongs to Jenna Brandt — his college sweetheart turned life partner. Their journey, rooted in shared passions and faith, began quietly at Iowa State University and blossomed into a heartwarming love story that captured fans’ attention long before their March 2024 wedding.Purdy and Brandt first met during their freshman year at Iowa State. Though neither has publicly revealed the exact moment they met, what’s clear is their shared connection through athletics. While Purdy was working his way up the ranks in football, Brandt was making her mark as a dedicated setter on the Iowa State volleyball team.Her love for the sport continued even after she transferred to the University of Northern Iowa in 2022. Reflecting on her time there, Brandt once wrote, “A dream come true to wear this jersey… volleyball: it’s the people that make the game.” Her gratitude toward her teammates and coaches reveals the strong community values that have shaped her both on and off the court.In July 2023, Purdy made their relationship official in a way fans had long been hoping for — he proposed to Brandt in a dreamy oceanfront moment in Saint Cloud, Florida. His heartfelt Instagram post said it all: ""My Jenna girl forever. I can’t wait to be your husband and grow together in Christ... I love you JB!""Brandt’s excitement was equally evident. In her announcement, she shared, “WE GET TO DO LIFE TOGETHER … FOREVER! Brock Purdy - I love everything about you & your heart for Jesus more than any words can say.""Before their March wedding, Brandt celebrated with a fun bachelorette trip to Telluride, Colorado, where she gushed, ""Snowwwwww in love w/ @brock.purdy13... Best friends in the best spot for the best weekend.""Their intimate ceremony took place on March 9, 2024, in Des Moines, Iowa, attended by close family and friends. Purdy later shared, ""No matter the circumstances in our life, Jesus will always be our firm foundation. I love you JP.""Born in Sumner, Iowa, Brandt has always valued family, crediting them for her decision to attend Iowa State. She was a standout athlete at Sumner-Fredericksburg High School, captaining her volleyball team and participating in track and club volleyball.Though her current profession remains under wraps, Brandt’s academic background in kinesiology suggests a deep interest in health and physical performance — aligning seamlessly with her lifelong athletic journey.From shared locker rooms to shared vows, Brock and Jenna’s story is a testament to love grounded in faith, friendship, and resilience — a true quarterback and setter duo, both on and off the field.Also Read: Brock Purdy contract details: How much the 49ers QB will earn after a massive extension?","Brock Purdy and Jenna Brandt tied the knot on March 9, 2024.

Aaron Rodgers reportedly set to join Steelers: A late move that could change everything in Pittsburgh



In what could become one of the boldest moves of the 2025 NFL offseason, legendary quarterback Aaron Rodgers is reportedly set to join the Pittsburgh Steelers . After months of silence and speculation, the veteran appears ready to don the black and gold, possibly marking the final chapter of his illustrious career.NFL insider Tom Pelissero believes it’s no longer a matter of if, but when the deal will be made official.“I anticipate Aaron Rodgers is going to end up committing to play for the Pittsburgh Steelers. It’s a matter of when, not if. It has not changed.”Despite Rodgers remaining publicly quiet for weeks, Pittsburgh has continued to prepare behind the scenes as though he’s their man. Their offseason strategy left little doubt — passing on high-profile quarterback prospects like Shedeur Sanders in favor of Will Howard in the sixth round. It was a calculated move that reflected unwavering confidence in landing Rodgers. Notably, rumors suggest Rodgers had privately issued an ultimatum that may have influenced the decision to skip Sanders, who ultimately landed with the Cleveland Browns.The Steelers’ front office is reportedly comfortable waiting until the final moments before training camp to see Rodgers sign. The 40-year-old quarterback has never been a fan of early offseason workouts, and showing up in August would be nothing new for him.“We also know this about Aaron. He’s never liked offseason workouts. He’s never felt like those things were necessary here,” Pelissero added.Still, Pittsburgh would ideally prefer him to join earlier, allowing time to adapt to their offensive scheme and build chemistry with his new teammates. Among them is DK Metcalf, who trained with Rodgers earlier this offseason — a signal that both sides have been building toward this moment for some time.The quarterback room in Pittsburgh has become an intriguing battleground. Will Howard enters with hopes of earning the starting job after a standout run with Ohio State, while Mason Rudolph returns as a fan favorite following a solid stint with the Tennessee Titans. Yet, Rodgers’ arrival would likely place him atop the depth chart — a final chance to chase another ring with a team craving playoff success.Rodgers' previous campaign with the New York Jets was marked by decline, and with new head coach Aaron Glenn deciding to move on, the writing was on the wall. Ironically, his first test in a Steelers uniform will come against his former team in the 2025 season opener.While former Steelers QB Russell Wilson had aspirations of returning and reuniting with Metcalf, the team made it clear their sights were set elsewhere. Wilson is now with the New York Giants, leaving the door wide open for Rodgers to lead the franchise.A one-year deal is expected, and many believe this season will be Rodgers' final bow in the NFL. It’s a high-stakes gamble for Pittsburgh — but one rooted in faith in head coach Mike Tomlin’s leadership. Since taking over in 2007, Tomlin has never had a losing season, yet the Steelers haven’t won a playoff game since 2017.If Rodgers can spark one last postseason run, he could help restore the Steelers' glory and end his career on a powerful note. For now, all eyes are on Pittsburgh — and on when their next quarterback finally walks through the door.Also Read: Steelers-Jets Week 1 game may not be a coincidence—Aaron Rodgers possibly influenced NFL's Week 1 schedule","NFL insider Tom Pelissero believes it’s no longer a matter of if, but when the deal will be made official.

Jury dismissed after claims of inappropriate conduct from defense lawyers

Players charged in connection with 2018 Hockey Canada event

Survivor testifies about traumatic night and lack of consent

The high-profile sexual assault trial involving five former Canadian hockey players took an unexpected and serious turn Friday when Ontario Superior Court Justice Maria Carroccia dismissed the jury due to allegations of misconduct by defense attorneys. The move will now place the responsibility of the verdict solely in the hands of the judge.The decision followed a formal complaint from a juror who submitted a note stating that multiple jury members felt mocked and ridiculed by the defense lawyers as they entered the courtroom. The juror alleged that attorneys Daniel Brown and Hilary Dudding—who represent one of the accused—laughed at them during proceedings. Both lawyers have firmly denied the accusation.Though Justice Carroccia stated she had not observed any behavior from counsel that concerned her directly, she acknowledged that the jurors’ perception of bias could affect the impartiality of the trial. “The jurors’ negative impression of the defense could impact the jury’s impartiality and was a problem that could not be remedied,” she concluded, thereby opting for a judge-only trial moving forward.The case involves five former junior hockey players—Michael McLeod, Dillon Dube, Carter Hart , Cal Foote, and Alex Formenton—who were charged in 2024 following renewed investigations into a 2018 incident in London, Ontario. The alleged assault took place during a Hockey Canada gala celebrating their world junior championship win. McLeod faces an additional charge of being a party to the offense.All five men have pleaded not guilty and are currently not affiliated with any NHL team or under contract.The woman at the center of the case testified remotely, stating that she was drunk, naked, and frightened when multiple men entered a hotel room. “I felt I had to go along with what the men wanted me to do,” she said. The prosecution argues that the men never made efforts to confirm consent.Defense attorneys, however, challenged her credibility during extensive cross-examinations, suggesting she willingly participated. She responded that she has no memory of initiating anything and insisted the players should have known she was in no condition to consent.Also Read: Mitch Marner’s last stand in Toronto?

Spain-Argentina blockbuster waits for security green light with World Cup looming



Spain’s newly crowned European champions and Lionel Messi’s Copa América-winning Argentina will collide in the Finalissima 2026 after FIFA penciled the intercontinental showcase into the international window of 23–31 March 2026. The decision, first revealed by Spanish daily Marca, creates a mouth-watering rematch of the 2022 spectacle in which Argentina swept aside Italy, and it places world football’s two reigning continental monarchs on a collision course barely 80 days before the expanded 48-team FIFA World Cup kicks off across North America.Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) has selected the Finalissima (previously known as the European/South American Nations Cup or Artemio Franchi Cup) dates of March 23 and 31, 2026, for the match between Spain and Argentina.Although FIFA has booked the late-March date, ratification is pending confirmation in its final stages, subject to coordination with Mexico City host-country security authorities and the 2026 World Cup organizers, with the June 11 opening day for the 2026 World Cup in Mexico City. The Spanish newspaper Marca said FIFA will have to secure the nod from security authorities before playing this match, as the 2026 World Cup would be looming.Security partners' approval is the last formality before tickets, TV spots, and commercial endorsements pour onto the market, but fans can already mark late March 2026 for a heavyweight encounter.

The meeting was held in Asunción, Paraguay, against the backdrop of the 75th FIFA Congress and saw representatives and authorities of the most powerful governing bodies of South American and European football converge.

Fans and experts react to the ruling

During the FA Cup final , Crystal Palace goalkeeper Dean Henderson created a lot of controversy by handling the ball outside of his penalty area while he was bringing down Manchester City's Erling Haaland , and not being given a red card. Now, an official statement gives reason to help clear things up.Dean Henderson rushed out to block a pass meant for Erling Haaland during the first half of the FA Cup final. TV replays showed he used his hand outside the penalty box, which many thought deserved a red card. Referee Stuart Attwell didn't call a foul, and VAR official Jarred Gillett agreed after checking.

However, he stayed on the field and later saved a penalty kick from Omar Marmoush. The call showed how tricky it can be to decide what a goal-scoring chance is.

NEW DELHI: At the season-opening Diamond League meet in Doha on Friday, all eyes were on Indian star Neeraj Chopra , who finally broke the elusive 90m barrier with a superb 90.23m throw.But one notable name missing from the javelin throw lineup was Pakistan’s Arshad Nadeem , the reigning Olympics gold medallist.Nadeem’s absence wasn’t due to injury or form issues, it was part of a planned training strategy.The 27-year-old is currently focused on preparing for the Asian Athletics Championships , set to take place in Gumi, South Korea, from May 27 to 31.According to his coaching team, Nadeem will depart for South Korea on May 22, prioritising peak performance at the continental event over early-season showings like the Diamond League.While Nadeem sat this one out, Chopra and Germany's Julian Weber made a statement in Doha.Under the guidance of legendary coach Jan Zelezny , the world record holder, Chopra became only the third Asian and 25th athlete in history to breach the 90m mark.His 90.23m effort wasn’t enough to win, though, as Weber edged ahead with a final-throw bomb of 91.06m. Still, for Chopra, it was a massive psychological and physical breakthrough.Chopra credited Zelezny’s presence and ideal weather conditions for his performance and expressed confidence that even longer throws are possible this season. As the reigning world champion, Chopra will head into the World Championships in Tokyo (Sept 13–21) with high momentum.""I am very happy that Jan Zelezny is my coach, and we worked very hard in South Africa.

A pioneering voice in football journalism

A legacy of insight and integrity left by Brian Glanville

Aged 93, Brian Glanville , possibly the best ever football writer , died on 16 May 2025. In a career that lasted more than seven decades, Glanville applied intellectual rigor and forensic analysis to his coverage of football, notably during a long association with The Sunday Times .Born on 24 September 1931 in Hendon, Middlesex, Australia, Glanville was just 19 when he took his first steps into journalism, co-writing a biography of Arsenal legend Cliff Bastin. He became a prodigious journalist, novelist, and screenwriter, writing for the Sunday Times for 30 years and World Soccer magazine for more than 50. His work reached outside the United Kingdom, and his work garnered international praise, including from Sports Illustrated’s Paul Zimmerman, who hailed him as “the greatest football writer of all time.”Glanville has written several influential football books, including the definitive “The Story of the World Cup” and “The Puffin Book of Football.” He also wrote and scripted the 1967 World Cup documentary “Goal!” and even had plays and a musical put on. In his novel “The Dying of the Light,” he examined the post-retirement difficulties faced by a former football player, demonstrating an insight into the game’s effects on the lives of those who play it.Glanville, who never minced his words and had harsh words for several England managers, including Sir Alf Ramsey and Bobby Robson, still counted players from both England and other countries, including Bobby Moore, as friends. His criticism darted from a place of such deep love for the game and such a commitment to journalistic purity. He was also an early proponent of studying systems of play, such as catenaccio, and introduced British readers to modern European trends in soccer long before they were adopted as mainstream concepts.Glanville’s impact was not confined to his own writing. He was part of the jury that votes on the Ballon d’Or each year and was known for his generosity and approachability, treating young journalists and people he barely knew with warmth and respect.Also Read: Samuel Eto'o pays tribute to late Cameroonian football legend Emmanuel Kunde With the passing away of Brian Glanville, a curtain has fallen on an era of football journalism.

Melinda French Gates’ dream which changed her life

Melinda Gates says she suffered panic attacks

Microsoft founder Bill Gates ex-wife Melinda French Gates has revealed that a recurring dream played an important role in her decision to end her 27-year marriage. The divorce, which was finalised in 2021, followed the surfacing of certain information that impacted the couple's relationship. In a recent interview Melinda French Gates revealed that she experienced recurring nightmares in late 2019. She claimed that the dream turned out be a turning point in her journey.In an interview with enterprenuer Jamie Kern Lima, French Gates described her symbolic dream. Melinda French Gates described that in her dream, she saw that she was standing on a cliff along with Bill Gates and their children. As the dream progressed, the portion of the cliff where she stood began to crumble and break away. This imagery had a profound effect on her, which she interpreted as a clear sign that she needed to separate from Bill and move forward on her own.“I was going to have to make a decision—and I was going to have to make it by myself,” she recalled.""Some dreams will take me years to understand, but if they’re recurring, I know I need to pay attention to them,” added Melinda Gates.While the dream served as a catalyst, Melinda's decision was also influenced by other factors. While she did not disclose specific details, Melinda acknowledged that certain things came out publicly, reinforcing her decision to leave the marriage. She referenced Bill Gates’ past meetings with Jeffrey Epstein, which she described as deeply disturbing. Bill has previously admitted that associating with Epstein was a mistake.In a recent candid interview with The Times, French Gates addressed Bill Gates’ remarks about their divorce. She said, “If you can’t live your values out inside your most intimate relationship, it was necessary.”French Gates also opened up about the emotional strain of the divorce, sharing that she experienced panic attacks throughout the separation. “When you’re leaving a marriage, it’s very, very hard. And the negotiations were tough,” she said.She shared that her first panic attack occurred in 2014 while having lunch with Gates, prompting her to begin therapy. “I’d heard of people having panic attacks and I didn’t know if it was a real thing,” she said.Initially skeptical of therapy, French Gates admitted she later came to understand its value. “It doesn’t mean I’m damaged,” she explained. “It means I’ve been through some difficult things that I need to figure out.”Following the divorce, both Bill and Melinda Gates have continued their philanthropic efforts, though they are no longer working together as a couple. Bill Gates has publicly expressed regret about the divorce, acknowledging his role in the dissolution of their marriage.","Melinda French Gates has revealed that a recurring dream played an important role in her decision to end her 27-year marriage to Bill Gates.

Poll Do you agree with Ashish Nehra's coaching approach for Siraj's out-swing deliveries? No, he should try something else Yes, it’s effective

IPL 2025: The unsung heroes of India's T20 league

NEW DELHI: Indian pacers Mohammed Siraj and Prasidh Krishna have played a key role in Gujarat Titans ' (GT) success during IPL 2025, accounting for wickets at regular intervals. While Siraj has picked 15 wickets so far this season, Krishna currently leads the wicket-taking chart, with 20 dismissals. The duo have benefitted from inputs shared by GT head coach Ashish Nehra as revealed by the team's veteran pacer Ishant Sharma.""Siraj already has experience in international cricket and understands his bowling. So, Nehra didn't try to tweak much. However, he noted that Siraj wasn't that confident about bowling out-swing deliveries and instead preferred to bowl with a wobble seam. So, Nehra told him, 'Your first ball will be an out-swinger. When the ball stops swinging, you can switch your approach to a wobble-seam delivery'. He's always urged Siraj to trust his out-swing,"" said Ishant Sharma on the 'Star Sports Press Room with Gujarat Titans around the race to the play-offs'.The veteran pacer further added that Nehra provided Prasidh feedback regarding the length at which he should be bowling.""Prasidh's natural length while bowling is 6 metres considering his height. Nehra told him, 'You have to push the length of your deliveries a little ahead. On red soil, you have to bowl four and a half metres. While bowling on black soil, it should be five to six metres',"" revealed Ishant.""Nehra further asked Prasidh to bowl a yorker once he was confident about the length of his deliveries. Our coach believes that there is nothing better than length bowling if the ball is being delivered accurately within the line of the stumps. There is only one thing which Ashu bhai wants bowlers to avoid which is unforced errors. He wants us to stick to the basics and make the batters hit the good deliveries,"" added the GT pacer.The Gujarat-based franchise was among the first few teams to resume training after the recent break in IPL 2025. Ishant shared an interesting anecdote showcasing the scenario and confusion at that point.""There was this perception that the IPL wouldn't be played with almost all international players going back. I told my manager, 'Please courier my luggage from Ahmedabad' as I had travelled back to Delhi. He responded that everyone is returning back to Ahmedabad. I also returned like the others,"" said Ishant.""As soon as we landed, everything changed. There was a 360-degree turnaround. We initially did a lot of fielding drills as a lot of catches were dropped during the practice sessions. The coach also put pressure on us,"" he added.Ishant further highlighted the work ethics of the GT setup, terming it ""insane"".""The manner in which GT practice is insane. We leave at 3 in the afternoon and return at 1 AM the next day. My wife has told me many times that we put in more effort while practicing on the ground than during the match,"" said the 36-year-old pacer.Catch Rajasthan Royals vs Punjab Kings at 3:30 PM, followed by Delhi Capitals vs Gujarat Titans at 7:30 PM tomorrow, May 18, as teams race to the TATA IPL play-offs — live and exclusive on JioHotstar and Star Sports Network","Mohammed Siraj has picked 15 wickets so far this season.

NEW DELHI: Persistent rain has cast a shadow over the much-anticipated IPL 2025 clash between Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) and Kolkata Knight Riders ( KKR ) at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium on Saturday.The toss, originally scheduled for the evening, has been delayed as heavy showers continued to sweep across Bengaluru.IPL officials took to the social media platform X to confirm the delay, stating: “Update: The toss has been delayed due to rain in Bengaluru. Stay tuned for further updates.”While fans are still holding onto hope for some cricketing action tonight, the match officials have set key timings in place.Overs will begin to be reduced if rain persists beyond 8:45 PM IST. However, there remains a reasonable window of opportunity for play; the cut-off time to begin a five-over game is 10:56 PM IST.If the rain relents before that, we could still witness a high-octane, shortened match between two playoff contenders.The stakes are particularly high for both teams. RCB, currently second on the points table with 16 points, need just one more win to secure a playoff berth and potentially finish in the top two, a crucial advantage in the knockout stages.Their recent form has been impressive, with four consecutive victories pushing them into serious title contention.For KKR, however, the situation is more desperate. With just 11 points, they must win both of their remaining matches to reach 15 and stay alive in the playoff race.

India’s golden boy of athletics, Neeraj Chopra , scripted history on Friday evening at the Doha Diamond League 2025 by breaching the elusive 90-metre barrier in men’s javelin throw for the first time in his career. The reigning world champion recorded a best throw of 90.23 metres, becoming only the 25th athlete in history to cross the prestigious mark. However, despite his personal milestone, Chopra had to settle for second place as Germany’s Julian Weber stole the show with a winning throw of 91.06 metres.Competing at the Qatar Sports Club Stadium , Neeraj got off to a brilliant start with a strong 88.44m throw in his very first attempt, which immediately put him in the lead. His second attempt was a foul, but he bounced back in style with his third — launching the javelin to a staggering 90.23 metres. That effort not only marked a career-best for Chopra but also made him the latest entrant in the elite 90m club, a mark considered the gold standard in javelin throwing.Julian Weber, however, had other plans. The German athlete, a consistent performer on the Diamond League circuit, saved his best for the day — unleashing a mighty 91.06m throw that edged out Chopra and earned him the top podium finish.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? The milestone comes at an exciting phase in Neeraj’s career. Now under the guidance of legendary coach Jan Zelezny a three-time Olympic champion and world record holder with a throw of 98.48m , Neeraj appears to be peaking just in time for a packed athletics season. This was Chopra’s first major competition of the year after switching coaches, and his performance in Doha will surely raise expectations ahead of the Olympics and other major events.Chopra’s feat adds him to an exclusive group of 25 javelin throwers worldwide who have thrown beyond 90 metres a club that includes greats like Zelezny himself, Johannes Vetter, Thomas Röhler, and Arshad Nadeem. The 90m throw has been achieved just 126 times in history, underlining the rarity and difficulty of the achievement.Although he didn’t win the event, Neeraj’s performance has reignited excitement among Indian sports fans and experts alike, signalling a new chapter in his illustrious journey. As one of the most decorated athletes in Indian history, Neeraj continues to push boundaries, and with the 90m milestone now conquered, his sights are firmly set on even bigger glories.This Doha meet was especially crucial as Chopra will not compete later this month due to the cancellation of the NC Classic 2025 in Bengaluru. With a statement performance in Qatar, he has laid down a strong marker for the rest of the season.A strong run from India’s Parul Chaudhary saw her set a new national record in the women’s 3000m steeplechase, clocking 9:13.39 to finish a commendable sixth in a high-quality field in Doha.With this performance, Chaudhary not only raised the national benchmark but also improved significantly on her 16th-place Diamond League debut in Eugene last year.",Neeraj Chopra recorded a best throw of 90.23 metres at the Doha Diamond League 2025.

The IPL resumes on Saturday after a 10-day break caused by India-Pakistan border tensions, with Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) facing Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) in a crucial clash at M Chinnaswamy Stadium . RCB, second on the table with 16 points from 11 matches, need a win to secure a playoff berth, while sixth-placed KKR must win to keep their knockout hopes alive. The break disrupted both teams’ momentum — RCB were on a four-match winning streak, while KKR had won two of their last three.RCB appear better equipped to handle the restart, with skipper Rajat Patidar returning to nets after a finger injury and key overseas players like Phil Salt, Tim David, and Liam Livingstone back in the squad. However, injuries to Devdutt Padikkal and Josh Hazlewood remain concerns.The spotlight will be on Virat Kohli following his sudden Test retirement. Fans are expected to show support by wearing whites, though Kohli will rely on inner fire to deliver a strong performance.KKR's struggles lie in inconsistent batting, with only Ajinkya Rahane and Angkrish Raghuvanshi showing form. While their bowling unit has held firm, the absence of Moeen Ali due to illness adds to their challenges.The Chinnaswamy pitch has so far favoured the bowlers, offering unexpected assistance in the form of bounce for pacers and bite for spinners. However, the extended break and the onset of the monsoon may have altered its behaviour, prompting teams to reassess and adapt their strategies accordingly.Jacob Bethell, Virat Kohli, Devdutt Padikkal, Rajat Patidar (c), Jitesh Sharma (wk), Tim David, Krunal Pandya, Romario Shepherd, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Lungi Ngidi, Yash DayalImpact Sub: Suyash Sharma/Liam LivingstoneRahmanullah Gurbaz (wk), Sunil Narine, Ajinkya Rahane (c), Angkrish Raghuvanshi, Manish Pandey, Andre Russell, Rinku Singh, Ramandeep Singh, Harshit Rana, Vaibhav Arora, Varun ChakaravarthyImpact Sub: Anukul RoyThe IPL’s restart in Bengaluru may face weather disruptions, with thunderstorms and showers expected on Saturday evening.

NEW DELHI: A day after announcing his retirement from Test cricket, Indian batting legend Virat Kohli visited Vrindavan with his wife, Anushka Sharma , to seek guidance from the spiritual leader Premanand Maharaj. The couple visited Shri Hit Radha Keli Kunj Ashram in Vrindavan to receive blessings.Photos of Kohli and Anushka interacting with Premanand Maharaj in Vrindavan quickly went viral on social media.After leaving the ashram, Kohli was spotted exiting his car holding a Jaap counting machine . He waved to fans briefly before walking quietly into the airport.Kohli is set to take the field for Royal Challengers Bangalore in their IPL 2025 match against Kolkata Knight Riders on Saturday.On Monday, Kohli announced his retirement from Test cricket, marking the end of a stellar career in the longest format. He played 123 Tests for India, amassing 9,230 runs at an average of 46.85, including 30 centuries.As captain, Kohli led India to 40 wins in 68 Tests, the most by any Indian skipper to date.Former India coach Ravi Shastri described Kohli as “mentally fried and overcooked” due to constant public scrutiny. While surprised by Kohli’s decision to retire, Shastri believed the star batter still had two to three years left in Test cricket.Shastri also revealed that he had spoken to Kohli shortly before the announcement was made public.""I did speak to him about it, I think a week before that [his announcement] and his mind was very clear that he'd given us everything. There were no regrets,"" Shastri told The ICC Review.""Virat surprised me because I thought he had at least two-three years of Test match cricket left in him. But then, when you're mentally fried and overcooked, that's what tells your body. You might be physically the fittest guy in the business.""You might be fitter than half the guys in your team, but mentally you're well done, as they say, then it sends a message to the body. You know, that's it,"" he said.Opening up on their conversation, Shastri said Kohli's infectious personality and the constant spotlight he was under contributed to a burnout.""He's got accolades around the globe. He has a bigger following than any other cricketer in the last decade. Whether it's Australia, whether it's South Africa, he just got people to watch the game. There was a love-hate relationship.""They would get angry because he had the ability to get under the skin of the viewers. In the way he celebrated, you know his intensity was such that it was like a rash.""It spread very quickly, not just within the dressing room, but within living rooms as well for people watching cricket. So, he was an infectious personality,"" he added.","Virat Kohli visited Vrindavan to seek guidance from spiritual leader Premanand Maharaj. Kohli announced his retirement from Test cricket on Monday.

Ryan Chesley’s signing signals new beginning for Washington’s defense



Chesley’s experience and pro debut highlight Capitals’ defensive future



The Washington Capitals have taken a significant step toward strengthening their defensive future by signing rising star Ryan Chesley to a three-year entry-level contract. With the 2025-26 season marking the start of his NHL journey, Capitals fans and hockey analysts alike are watching closely to see if Chesley can develop into the reliable, shutdown defenseman the franchise desperately needs. This move reflects Washington’s commitment to investing in young talent as they look to balance a competitive roster with long-term potential.Selected 37th overall in the 2022 NHL Draft, Ryan Chesley has steadily built an impressive and well-rounded resume through his collegiate career at the University of Minnesota and his early professional exposure with the Hershey Bears in the American Hockey League (AHL). The 21-year-old defenseman’s newly signed three-year contract carries an average annual NHL salary of $923,333, along with a corresponding AHL salary, clearly signaling the Capitals’ strong belief in his future potential and impact on their roster.Chesley’s development at Minnesota showcased his versatile two-way ability — consistently contributing 38 points while maintaining a strong defensive presence, reflected in a remarkable plus-minus rating of +34 over 115 NCAA games. Notably, he excelled in blocked shots and took on key leadership roles, qualities that NHL teams highly value in young defensemen striving to make the leap to the professional level.Adding to his credentials, Chesley’s international experience further enhances his profile, having represented the United States twice at the prestigious IIHF World Junior Championships . He earned a gold medal in 2024 while serving as an alternate captain and logging heavy minutes against some of the best young talent in the world.Also Read: No love like a Mother’s: Jane Gaudreau remembers late son Johnny Gaudreau in an emotional tweet that breaks internet While his full transition to the pro level is just beginning, Chesley’s promising performance with the Hershey Bears — recording points early in his AHL stint — shows clear potential that he could soon become a vital contributor on Washington’s blue line. As the Capitals look to bolster their defense and strategically prepare for future challenges, Ryan Chesley’s signing might very well prove to be a pivotal move in the organization’s ongoing rebuild and quest for sustained playoff success.","The Washington Capitals have signed rising star Ryan Chesley to a three-year entry-level contract.

Manager Brandon Hyde is gone—can a healthier rotation and improved offense turn Baltimore Orioles' season around?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/mlb/news/manager-brandon-hyde-is-gonecan-a-healthier-rotation-and-improved-offense-turn-baltimore-orioles-season-around/articleshow/121244811.cms,"Orioles fire Brandon Hyde amid struggles, but with offensive improvements and pitchers returning, there’s renewed hope for a late-season turnaround.

With Brandon Hyde out and help on the way, is this the turning point the Orioles desperately needed?



The Baltimore Orioles sent shockwaves through Major League Baseball this weekend, announcing the firing of manager Brandon Hyde—a decision that signals more than just dissatisfaction with a rocky start. It’s a drastic attempt to breathe life back into a team that entered the 2025 season with postseason aspirations, only to fall into one of the deepest early-season slumps in recent memory. Hyde’s dismissal isn’t merely about his win-loss record; it’s the front office’s way of telling fans, “We’re not standing still.”Despite leading the Orioles through a grueling rebuild and overseeing a youth-laden roster that made back-to-back playoff appearances, Brandon Hyde finds himself out after compiling a 421-493 record. His 2023 AL Manager of the Year award and World Series pedigree as a Cubs bench coach in 2016 weren’t enough to save him from the weight of unmet expectations. At 15-28, with the team 10.5 games out of first and possessing the worst ERA in the American League (5.33), the Orioles had little room for patience.What makes this decline even more jarring is how much talent remains on the roster. This is largely the same group that notched 101 wins just two seasons ago. But 2025 has delivered a harsh reality check. The offense has sputtered to 25th in runs scored—a dramatic fall from their top-10 rankings in previous seasons. Losing power-hitter Anthony Santander in free agency didn’t help, but the larger concern lies in the core. Adley Rutschman (.214 AVG, 90 OPS+) and Jordan Westburg (.217 AVG, 88 OPS+) have been shadows of their 2023 selves. Even Gunnar Henderson, though not terrible, hasn’t hit the MVP stride many expected.The turnaround needs to start immediately, and it must begin with the bats. There is hope, however. Rutschman and Westburg have shown flashes of breaking out, while Ryan O’Hearn and top prospect Jackson Holliday are offering sparks of consistency. If this offense clicks again—and quickly—the Orioles could climb back into the wild card conversation.On the mound, the story isn’t any prettier. The bullpen ranks 26th in the league with a 4.96 ERA, but the pieces suggest potential. Félix Bautista’s absence has been glaring, but Yennier Cano, Cionel Pérez, Gregory Soto, and Bryan Baker all have the track records to stabilize things if they find form.The real concern sits in the starting rotation, which currently boasts the third-worst ERA in baseball (5.60). Only the Marlins and Rockies have fared worse. Zach Eflin and Tomoyuki Sugano have provided some stability—Sugano especially, with a 3.08 ERA through nine starts—but the rest of the rotation has failed to deliver.There’s cautious optimism surrounding the eventual return of Kyle Bradish and Grayson Rodriguez, both of whom could form a formidable quartet alongside Eflin and Sugano. Dean Kremer and Albert Suárez could offer additional depth if they regain form. But banking on injury returns and sudden revivals carries no guarantees.Still, there's a blueprint—however fragile—for recovery. The 2022 Phillies fired Joe Girardi midseason at 22-29 and reached the World Series with Rob Thomson. The 2019 Nationals began the year 19-31 before winning it all. “Can the Orioles make a similar run? Let’s see if we can look with orange-colored glasses here and find a way back to contention.”The Orioles’ season isn’t lost—yet. The expanded wild card format keeps a faint door open, but the clock is ticking. Brandon Hyde’s firing may not have been fair, but it was the front office’s gamble to inject urgency into a faltering squad.The road ahead is narrow and filled with ""ifs,"" but with the talent already in the clubhouse, a dramatic turnaround isn’t out of the question. It may not be likely, but the percentage chance of this move triggering a Phillies-style revival? It's better than zero.Also Read: Brandon Hyde’s firing sparks heartbreak and accountability from Orioles players in emotional aftermath",The Baltimore Orioles fired manager Brandon Hyde this weekend.

R Praggnanandhaa once again stole a march over D Gukesh in an elite classical tournament this year. At Wijk aan Zee, The Netherlands, he needed Erigaisi Arjun to win the last game of the classical phase before beating world champion Gukesh in tiebreak playoffs.But at the Global Chess Tour (GCT) Romania tournament, Pragg left his more celebrated compatriot far behind. It was not a high-scoring tournament.World No. 7 Pragg (Elo 2758) needed just two wins (over Nodirbek Abdusattorov and Wesley So) in nine games to be in a three-way tie and then proved himself to be better than Frenchmen Alireza Firouzja and Maxime Lagrave in blitz playoff. He had lost all three games, including one against Gukesh, in last year’s four-way playoff in the same tournament. Though Pragg reached the 2023 World Cup final and defeated Magnus Carlsen multiple times in speed chess, Gukesh and Arjun made more definitive progress in classical chess last year.Pragg is turning a new leaf now with solidity and pragmatism without compromising much on an ambitious approach.Former seven-time national champion Pravin Thipsay told TOI: “He played speculative chess in 2023 and thereabouts. The Candidates 2024 was a great opportunity which made him fully understand that speculative play can’t be the strategy in a classical game. He now plays more accurate openings and consistently follows the strategic ideas in the sharp positions he chooses.”With two defeats and eight wins at Wijk and Bucharest in 22 games among elite rivals, what is he doing differently this year? “Nothing specific,” Pragg said.“I am trying to be more ambitious whenever I play, trying to go for tournament wins. Thanks to Ramesh sir too, when things were not going my way last year, we were trying to improve on things. I think we are seeing the results of that hard work.”","R Praggnanandhaa stole a march over D Gukesh in an elite classical tournament this year.

His demeanour reflects modesty, exceptional sportsmanship and a pleasant disposition.Neeraj stands as India’s most accomplished Olympic sport athlete today. His achievements in javelin throw encompass victories across all major international competitions, including the Olympics, World championships , Asian Games, CWG and Diamond League meets.Following his historic gold at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, which established him as a global sporting icon, the 90m-mark remained his sole unconquered milestone. This changed on Friday evening at the Diamond League in Doha, where he registered an impressive 90.23m throw in his third attempt.Declaring “90m is just the beginning”, he said he is focusing on achieving greater distances in forthcoming competitions, particularly targeting the World Championships in Tokyo from Sep 13-21.“I am ready to throw farther…it’s just the beginning for me. There’s a long season ahead. With the 90m target achieved, the aim would be to go as farther as possible. I’ll look to throw more than 90m in the coming events till the Worlds,” Neeraj said following his brilliant season-opening performance in Doha.The reigning World and Asian Games champion said he felt sharper, fitter and energetic coming into the meet, after having been troubled by a nagging groin injury for many years, including the Paris Games.“I feel sharper and quicker in my follow through. I have always been troubled by my groin injury in the last few years. I wasn’t able to give my best because of that. This year, I am feeling good about myself and my throws. I am quite confident of bettering my Friday night’s effort in the future competitions,” he said.Talking about Czech javelin legend Jan Zelezny, who has been working with the Indian since Nov last year, the 27-year-old said the coach had told him beforehand — “today is the day to achieve 90m”.“When I was having warm-up throws my coach said, ‘Today is the day when you can throw 90m’. Even after my 90m throw, he told me ‘You can throw 2-3m farther’. We are still working on some aspects of my throw.

Tears and regret as Orioles players react to Brandon Hyde’s sudden firing



The Baltimore Orioles have officially parted ways with manager Brandon Hyde following a rough 15-29 start to the 2025 season. The move comes as a sobering moment for a team that, not long ago, seemed poised to be a perennial force in the American League. With Hyde’s departure, the Orioles’ clubhouse finds itself grappling with more than just poor results—they're also reckoning with the loss of a beloved leader.Brandon Hyde’s impact extended far beyond the stat sheet. He was widely respected for the trust he placed in his players and the culture he helped establish during the franchise's lengthy rebuild. That sentiment was echoed by multiple players in the aftermath of the decision.“He’s put me in a lot of great positions to succeed, and I can’t thank him enough for everything he’s done,” shortstop Gunnar Henderson shared with MLB.com. “I hate it for him and his family.”Infielder Ramón Urías also reflected on the emotional weight of Hyde’s exit, saying, “It’s really tough. He’s the only manager I have played for in the big leagues so far, and obviously, I’m so grateful for the opportunity that he gave me. We’re going to miss him as a person.""Perhaps most telling was 21-year-old infielder Jackson Holliday’s candid acknowledgment of the players’ accountability. “I think everyone understands that. He’s not the one playing the games. We’re the ones playing the games,” Holliday admitted. “We haven’t lived up to our expectations, and it’s difficult.”Hyde’s tenure, which began in 2019, was marked by patience and long-term vision. He was instrumental in guiding the Orioles through a painful rebuild, which culminated in back-to-back postseason appearances in 2023 and 2024, including a 101-win season. But Baltimore’s promising young core has stumbled this year, ranking near the bottom of the league in runs scored, team ERA, and defensive efficiency.Despite their struggles, questions remain about whether Hyde was set up to succeed. Baltimore’s conservative approach to payroll and roster upgrades in recent offseasons left the team thin in key areas, putting even more pressure on the players and staff.In his place, interim manager Tony Mansolino has stepped in—but the early returns haven’t been promising. Baltimore fell 10-6 to the Washington Nationals in Mansolino’s debut, surrendering seven runs in the first two innings.Hyde leaves with a 421-492 record, but his legacy will likely be remembered for laying the foundation of a team still searching for its identity. Whether this managerial change jumpstarts a turnaround or deepens the Orioles' woes remains to be seen.Also Read: Red Sox edge Braves 7-6 as Rafael Devers delivers clutch 9th-inning walk-off homer at Fenway","The Baltimore Orioles have fired manager Brandon Hyde.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

Delhi Results 2025: 'LinkedIn Lessons' from Brand BJP's win and Brand AAP's loss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-results-2025-linkedin-lessons-from-brand-bjps-win-and-brand-aaps-loss/articleshow/118066797.cms,"AAP: From Disruptor to Establishment to Decline



AAP was the ultimate political startup—the kind that raises Series A, B, and C funding at record speed, becomes a unicorn, and then implodes under its own weight. It was supposed to be the alternative to traditional politics, the fresh face in a crowded market, a party that rejected caste, religion, and dynasty-driven politics.

But somewhere along the way, it stopped being a startup and started behaving like an old-school corporate giant—bloated, bureaucratic, and overconfident.

1) From Lean & Agile to Bureaucratic & Slow

AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach—the political equivalent of a D2C brand shaking up a legacy market.

Over time, it became centralized and top-heavy, with decision-making confined to a handful of leaders. MLAs became inaccessible, the leadership became distant, and ground-level mobilization weakened. No succession planning. Kejriwal remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force.

remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force. The result? Voters saw it as just another party, not the disruptor it once was.

2) A Reputation Built on Ethics, Lost to Scandals

AAP built its brand on fighting corruption—but its own leadership got embroiled in one of the biggest scandals of its time, the liquor policy scam.

Manish Sisodia, Sanjay Singh, and even Kejriwal himself faced corruption allegations, undoing years of anti-corruption positioning.

The Sheesh Mahal controversy—where Kejriwal’s residence was allegedly renovated with ₹45 crore of taxpayer money—completely shattered the “humble leader” narrative.

AAP’s response? Defensive, aggressive, and dismissive. Instead of damage control, it doubled down on denial—a classic PR blunder.

The perception shift was swift and brutal—from “anti-corruption warriors” to just another power-hungry political entity.

3) Ignoring the Middle-Class Voter That Built Its Base

AAP was originally the party of the middle class—frustrated taxpayers who wanted clean governance and economic relief.

Over time, its focus shifted to freebies and populist policies, leaving the middle class feeling ignored.

BJP stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters.

stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters. Kejriwal’s pre-election outreach to the middle class felt forced and last-minute—while BJP had already solidified its positioning.

Takeaway ? A business (or party) that forgets its core customer will eventually lose them.

4) Blaming External Factors Instead of Owning Failures

For 10 years, AAP blamed the Centre, the LG, and opposition parties for everything.

The “victim card” was effective in the early years but wore thin by 2025—voters expected governance, not excuses.

BJP flipped this weakness into an advantage, promising that with a BJP-led government, there would be no Centre-state conflicts, leading to “seamless governance.”

The narrative changed from “AAP vs. BJP” to “AAP vs. Results.” Lesson? Leaders who constantly shift blame instead of delivering solutions lose credibility.

5) Strategic Missteps and Lack of Political Alliances

AAP contested separately from Congress, which led to a split in the anti-BJP vote.

Rahul Gandhi’s direct attacks on Kejriwal made matters worse—AAP was getting hit from both sides.

Internal conflicts weakened the party further. Atishi and Saurabh Bharadwaj were seen as Kejriwal’s successors, but there was no clear transition strategy.

BJP: A Masterclass in Strategic Adaptation

BJP’s 2025 win in Delhi was not a Modi-centric sweep but a well-calibrated organizational comeback. After a lackluster 2024 Lok Sabha performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader.

performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader. Unlike AAP, BJP adapted, restructured, and executed flawlessly.

1) Moving Beyond Modi Dependency

BJP understood that Delhi’s electorate needed a more localized approach.

Instead of making the election about Modi, it focused on governance, urban issues, and direct voter engagement.

No CM face? It didn’t matter. The party projected collective leadership instead of relying on one individual.

By decentralizing its campaign, BJP looked more stable and future-ready.

2) Adopting AAP’s Own Strategies Against It

BJP neutralized AAP’s welfare advantage—promising free electricity, continued subsidies, and additional financial support for women.

Middle-class tax reliefs were announced just before the elections, ensuring they won over voters that AAP had neglected.

The manifesto focused on real urban issues—pollution control, traffic congestion, and infrastructure—exactly what AAP had failed to address convincingly.

Lesson? The best way to beat a competitor is to adopt their strengths while exposing their weaknesses.

3) Letting Congress Do The Attacking



BJP didn’t need to attack AAP aggressively—Rahul Gandhi and Congress did that for them.

By letting AAP and Congress fight it out, BJP consolidated its voter base while the opposition split.

AAP’s credibility suffered more because the attacks came from within the anti-BJP camp.

A strategic win, without unnecessary effort.

4) A Disciplined, Focused, and Well-Executed Campaign

BJP stayed on message, focusing on corruption, governance, and economic stability.

The campaign was structured and well-planned, unlike AAP’s which seemed reactive and disorganized.

The promise to investigate AAP’s corruption cases resonated with voters, reinforcing BJP’s stance on accountability.

In business terms? BJP had a clear marketing strategy, strong brand positioning, and flawless execution.

5) Final Takeaways

Adaptability is key. BJP recalibrated after its 2024 Lok Sabha setbacks, while AAP remained stagnant.

Brand trust is fragile. AAP built its image on honesty but lost credibility due to scandals and mismanagement.

Execution matters more than rhetoric. BJP delivered a disciplined, well-structured campaign.

Leadership succession planning is critical. AAP failed to build second-line leadership, while BJP showcased organizational depth.

Voters reward governance, not excuses. After a decade in power, AAP’s blame game no longer worked.

Politics, like business, rewards those who adapt, execute, and deliver.

Ah, another election, another flood of LinkedIn wisdom posts—where every poll result is a ""case study,"" every political leader is a ""CEO,"" and every campaign is an ""MBA-level lesson in leadership."" Some call it democracy, but on LinkedIn, it’s all about business jargon and corporate analogies.So, let’s break this down the LinkedIn way.BJP, on the other hand, had a structured, disciplined campaign with clear messaging and no internal rifts. In politics and business, a divided team rarely wins.","AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach.

What’s the tile game Meghan Markle played on Netflix? A beginner’s guide to mahjong,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/whats-the-tile-game-meghan-markle-played-on-netflix-a-beginners-guide-to-mahjong/articleshow/120736644.cms,"Meghan Markle played the game of Mahjong in her Netflix series

From the Qing dynasty to pop culture

How is mahjong played?

Connor Wan, a 29-year-old British-Chinese artist, learned mahjong while visiting family in Hong Kong. He enjoyed it so much that he started the Four Winds Mahjong Club in London, and later brought it to Toronto after moving there in 2024. “Moving countries is hard, especially when you don’t know anyone,” he said. The club became popular quickly, not as a place for gambling, but for making friends and celebrating Asian culture. Nicole Wong, a writer and audio producer from California, started playing mahjong as a teenager with her grandparents. She later began The Mahjong Project in 2019 to share the game’s cultural stories and organise pop-up game nights. This year, she published a book called Mahjong: House Rules from Across the Asian Diaspora. Nicole says the sound of the tiles is especially powerful. “Mahjong is more than just fun,” she says. “It has a deep history and brings back strong memories.” In Toronto, Robyn Feldberg has taught over 250 people how to play mahjong through her courses. She donates all the money—about $50,000 so far—to charities like Save A Child’s Heart. She says the game is especially popular with young mothers who want a fun way to relax and connect with others. “They tell me, ‘We want something that’s just for us,’” she said.

A centuries-old Chinese game called mahjong is having a modern revival across continents, from luxury cruise ships and trendy hotel lounges to Meghan Markle’s Netflix series.In the sixth episode of her docuseries With Love, the Duchess of Sussex invites friends for a cosy game night – playing mahjong, reports the Globe and Mail.The four-person tile-based game, traditionally associated with Chinese culture, is now catching on with new generations across the globe. “The game itself is really so fun,” says Markle. “But what was so great was the idea of learning something new with your friends, together... the mahjong becomes the background of the expansion of friendship. It’s the feeling of community.”Mahjong dates back to the mid-1800s during the Qing Dynasty in China. Traditionally played with 144 tiles, the game blends skill, strategy and a touch of luck. Players pick and discard tiles to form winning hands, much like the card game rummy.The game’s expansion across the world has now erupted into a full-blown trend. The World Mahjong Championship was recently held in Mississauga, Ontario – the first time it’s been hosted in North America. Hotels such as the Ace Hotel New York and Thompson Hotel Dallas regularly hold mahjong-themed nights.Fans with money to spare are buying fancy mahjong sets from Hermès, Louis Vuitton, and Ralph Lauren. Some are even splashing out on luxury tables that shuffle the tiles automatically – costing over $4,500.Even cruise ships have joined the trend, offering mahjong tournaments and special rooms just for playing the game.Mahjong is played with 144 tiles. Players begin by shuffling the tiles face down. Everyone rolls dice and the highest roller becomes the dealer. Each player picks 36 tiles and builds a wall—two rows of 18 tiles. The walls are pushed forward, creating a space in the middle for discards. Each player then draws 13 tiles (the dealer starts with 14), and the game begins.Players take turns drawing one tile and discarding one, always keeping 13 tiles in hand. You can draw a new tile or pick up someone’s discarded one. If a discarded tile helps complete a set (called a meld), you can grab it, announce the set, and show the tiles. To win, a player must have four melds (like three or four matching tiles or a sequence of three in a suit) and one pair (two matching tiles)—making 14 tiles total.There are five types of tiles: Bamboo, Characters, Dots (these are the three main suits), and special tiles called Honors (Dragons and Winds) and Bonus (Flowers and Seasons). Each suit goes from 1 to 9. Honors and Bonus tiles add extra excitement but aren't needed to win. Mahjong mixes strategy and memory with a bit of luck—and it’s all about building the right sets before your opponents do.For many mahjong fans, it’s not just a game but a deeply social experience.","Mahjong dates back to the mid-1800s during the Qing Dynasty in China.

The journey within

Slippers that switched color…

… and horses too?

Through green-tinted glasses

What color was Dorothy's dress actually?

A kaleidoscope of adaptations





On May 17, 1900, US author Lyman Frank Baum published a tale that has since enchanted readers and viewers over generations with its unforgettable characters, magical settings and universal themes of courage, friendship and the search for home.At the heart of the story is Dorothy Gale , a young girl living on a quiet Kansas farm. When a powerful tornado sweeps her and her dog Toto away, she finds herself in the fantastical Land of Oz, where wonder and danger lurk. Advised by a kind witch, Dorothy sets off for the Emerald City by following a Yellow Brick Road, hoping that the mysterious Wizard of Oz can help her return home.Along the way, she befriends a Scarecrow wanting a brain, a Tin Man longing for a heart and a Cowardly Lion seeking courage. Together, they face trials, outwit a wicked witch and discover that the qualities they each sought lay within them all along.Dorothy's magical ruby slippers , which she acquires after her tornado-borne house lands on and kills the Wicked Witch of the East, hold the final key to her return home.Britannica, which describes it as ""a modern fairy tale with a distinctly American setting,"" also states that some consider the gutsy Dorothy as one of the first feminist heroes in children's literature.Whether through film, stage or song, the diverse adaptations of the Land of Oz have since seen it evolve into a pop culture icon. But the visuals most often associated with it stem mainly from MGM's 1939 film adaptation starring then-16-year-old Judy Garland, whose wistful rendition of ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" was voted ""the greatest song of the 20th century"" in a 2001 joint survey by the National Endowment for the Arts and the Recording Industry Association of America.On the book's 125th anniversary, here are some curious backstories on the colors that breathed life into "" The Wizard of Oz .""In Baum's original book, Dorothy's enchanted footwear were silver, not ruby.T he 1939 film famously changed them to a glimmering red to take full advantage of the then-new Technicolor film process. Red simply popped better on screen as opposed to silver, and especially against the yellow bricks of the road.One pair of these slippers worn by Judy Garland, stolen in 2005 from a Minnesota museum and recovered by the FBI in 2018, sold at auction for $28 million in 2024.Way before CGI, there was food dye.To recreate ""a horse of a different color,"" the dazzling, color-changing horse that greets Dorothy and friends in the Emerald City, four separate white horses were used to create the effect of a single horse that changes color from moment to moment.The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals had objected to the horses' fur being dyed traditionally; the lore goes that technicians tinted them either with jello powder or food dye to create a spectrum of white, purple, red and yellow.As the equine actors reportedly kept licking the colored powder off between takes, the scenes had to be shot as quickly as possible.Curiously, what is known as the ""Emerald City"" is neither green nor built of emeralds. It appears so because everyone is required to wear green-tinted glasses, a clever ruse by the Wizard to create the illusion of grandeur.The 1939 film, however, featured a literal green metropolis, thus forever cementing the Emerald City in popular culture as a glowing, green paradise.There's also diverging takes online on whether Dorothy's gingham pinafore dress was blue and white or blue and pink. Some fan sites explain that what appeared to be blue and white, was in reality, blue and light pink. The costume team had apparently used pink, which rendered better on screen under the intense lighting of that era.One cannot help but recall the color challenge on social media in early 2015, known as ""The Dress."" Remember? That viral phenomenon where a photograph of a dress sparked a debate on whether it was white and gold or blue and black, due to differences in color perception and how the brain interprets lighting.Since its original publication, ""The Wizard of Oz"" has spawned colorful interpretations.Singer Elton John's ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road"" (1973), co-written with long-time collaborative partner Bernie Taupin, uses Oz imagery to symbolize disillusionment with fame and a yearning for a simpler life. The 78-year-old singer's final world tour was renamed ""Farewell Yellow Brick Road."" It began in Allentown, Pennsylvania, US, on September 8, 2018, and ended in Stockholm, Sweden, on July 8, 2023.Meanwhile, 1978's ""The Wiz"" was an all-Black musical reimagining starring ex-Supremes singer Diana Ross as Dorothy and the late King of Pop Michael Jackson as the Scarecrow. Based on what was originally a successful Broadway musical, the film was widely panned by critics. But something more significant happened behind the scenes: It led veteran producer Quincy Jones to first cross paths with his future ""Thriller"" collaborator, JacksonAnd finally, Broadway's 2003 blockbuster ""Wicked"" flipped the script entirely, telling the untold story of the misunderstood ""Wicked Witch of the West"" Elphaba, complete with emerald skin and gravity-defying vocals. Incidentally, the musical's most recognizable number is, indeed, ""Defying Gravity.""The musical, which is based on a novel of the same name, has since been adapted into a two-part film, with Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande leading the cast. The first part was released in 2024 and was nominated for 10 Oscars at the 97th Academy Awards, winning two, best costume design and production design.","On May 17, 1900, US author Lyman Frank Baum published a tale that has since enchanted readers and viewers over generations.

Why LeBron James ranks below Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant in the all-time NBA hierarchy

Major Leafs Surprise w/ Charles Barkley - Episode 563

In the ongoing discussion about who the best NBA players are, Charles Barkley shares an interesting take. While a lot of folks put LeBron James in the top three, Barkley sees him as seventh, pointing out a key difference: that killer instinct. He believes Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant had a natural ferocity that LeBron just doesn't have. Barkley insists this isn't just about the numbers; it's about that unteachable drive that really defines greatness.NBA legend and analyst Charles Barkley has ignited debate by putting LeBron James at number seven on his all-time greats list. Barkley argues that this is because LeBron doesn't possess the 'killer instinct,' that unyielding urge to crush his competition. He points out that Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant had it in spades. ""natural born killers,"" exhibiting an aggressive competitiveness that LeBron, in his view, does not possess.During his appearance on the 'Spittin’ Chiclets' podcast, Barkley said, 'Nobody ever referred to Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant as nice guys.' He stressed that their goal was to win, but also to 'dominate, destroy, and humiliate' their competition. Barkley feels LeBron is 'too nice,' suggesting he lacks the aggressive edge that defined Jordan and Bryant's game.Barkley pointed out that this killer instinct isn't something you can just pick up; it's something you're born with. He said, 'You can't train to be a natural born killer.' This view emphasizes the mental aspect of a player, which goes beyond just stats. Even though he recognizes LeBron's amazing career and what he's done for the sport, Barkley believes that without that natural aggression, LeBron falls short compared to Jordan and Bryant in the basketball legend rankings.Also Read: Garnett says Dallas Mavericks don’t need Cooper Flagg, calls out NBA for failing teams with broken draft system Charles Barkley believes that true greatness in basketball goes beyond just stats and awards. He argues that having a killer instinct—the fierce drive to dominate opponents — is what really sets the legends apart.

Foreign players happy with GT ‘communication’

Virat Kohli retires from Test cricket after 14 years

Break gives Capitals a breather

NEW DELHI: Shubman Gill ’s cheerful demeanour can be infectious. Before a drizzle interrupted training at the Ferozeshah Kotla on Saturday evening, Gill gathered his Gujarat Titans teammates and indulged in a fun warm-up session of football on the eve of their match against Delhi Capitals . His shrill voice and teenage levels of enthusiasm aside, it was apparent this was an emerging leader who exercised authority over the younger batch of players.Gill, at just 25, is at a defining stage of his career. The buzz in Indian cricket suggests he is seen as a long-term captaincy option and the promotion may happen as soon as next month, in the five-Test series in England. That he has come to Delhi with a team that has one foot in the IPL playoffs is a good point of reference to assess his leadership qualities.“He’s been fantastic with the way he’s been around with the group. I don’t need to mention how well he is batting right now and the way he is handling the situation. He has been scoring a lot of runs and managing the team really well,” Titans assistant coach Parthiv Patel said on Saturday.“He’s been very proactive on the field and off it. In fact, he plays an important role off the field. He spends a lot of time with the young players. I’ve said this before too. You can see actually Shubman Gill the captain in the dressing room. That’s what you want in a leader,” Patel said before adding. “Going forward, I can’t comment on whatever the talks (in the India camp) are, but Shubman Gill as Gujarat Titans captain has been fantastic.”Besides the captaincy talk, Gill the batter has been impeccable in white-ball cricket over the last three months. The rich vein of form notwithstanding, Gill barely misses a training session. On Saturday evening, he went through a long and rigorous nets session even as Delhi Capitals kept switching batters in the adjacent nets. There were no funky shots. He presented the full face of the bat to every ball and concentrated on timing, looking to hit mostly down the ground. He seemed in absolute control.Patel also said the GT management didn’t have any problems getting all their overseas players back, since the there was clear communication with the players.“I can tell you that the players were very happy with the way we dealt with the situation. We have been very transparent and they were happy with the way we communicated the situation with them. That’s why all of them are back,” Patel said.While Titans will look to seal their playoff spot on Sunday, Capitals will look to resurrect their campaign after it hit free fall before the tournament was halted last week. Capitals allrounder Vipraj Nigam said the team was looking at a fresh start. “We started the tournament well. When we reassembled, we decided we will treat this game as we did back when we started the tournament,” Vipraj said.","Shubman Gill is at a defining stage of his career.

Virat Kohli retires from Test cricket after 14 years

NEW DELHI: Delhi Capitals are gearing up to take on Gujarat Titans in their IPL 2025 clash at the Arun Jaitley Stadium in Delhi, and all eyes will be on star wicketkeeper-batter KL Rahul , who stands on the brink of a historic milestone. As reported by TimesofIndia.com , Delhi Capitals are considering a tweak in their batting order for the final three league-stage matches, with the experienced KL Rahul likely to return to the top as an opener for the Axar Patel-led side.Currently placed fifth on the points table with 13 points from 11 matches, DC are keen to solidify their top order, and promoting KL Rahul is being viewed as a key strategic move.KL Rahul is just 33 runs away from breaking an elite record held by batting legend Virat Kohli . If he manages to score those runs against Gujarat Titans on Sunday, he will become the fastest Indian to reach 8000 T20 runs, achieving the feat in just his 214th innings—surpassing Kohli’s record of 243 innings.The milestone will also make him the second-fastest overall in T20 history, ahead of Pakistan’s Babar Azam, who reached the mark in 218 innings.So far this season, KL Rahul has opened just once, batted at No.3 twice, and featured at No.4 in seven games—a role assigned to him before the season began.While he has produced steady performances in the middle order, the DC think tank is now inclined to use his experience at the top during the powerplay overs.However, Gujarat Titans could look to crash KL Rahul’s party by unleashing their ace spinner Rashid Khan.The Afghan star has had the better of KL Rahul in T20 battles so far—conceding just 40 runs off 47 balls while dismissing him three times.With a playoff spot at stake and a historic record within reach, Sunday’s clash promises high stakes for both KL Rahul and the Capitals.","KL Rahul is just 33 runs away from breaking an elite record held by batting legend Virat Kohli.

Bombay Sport Exchange Ep 5: Shane Watson on how IPL gave him a lifeline & his tribute to Phil Hughes

NEW DELHI: Nothing seems to be going right for Chennai Super Kings over the past two seasons. The five-time IPL champions missed out on a playoff spot in 2024 and endured another disappointing campaign in IPL 2025 . They were, in fact, the first team to be knocked out of the playoff race this season. Former CSK player Robin Uthappa acknowledged the team’s underwhelming performances but didn’t hold back in criticising fans who took their mockery of the MS Dhoni-led side to extreme levels.Matches between CSK and RCB have always been high-voltage affairs, often bringing out the worst in fans on both sides. The marquee clash has repeatedly seen heated exchanges in the stands, with supporters hurling offensive jibes at each other.This season too, before the IPL was suspended, RCB edged out CSK in a thrilling encounter to keep their playoff hopes alive.Ahead of that game, some RCB fans were spotted selling ‘CSK jail’ jerseys—an attempt to taunt the Chennai-based franchise over their two-year suspension from the IPL in 2016 and 2017.However, Uthappa, who has donned the jersey of both franchises during his IPL career, was unimpressed with the gesture. He criticised the actions of some RCB fans who held up white T-shirts with black stripes to mock CSK supporters.""It was pretty intense. Outside the stadium, they were mocking the team, the players of the team when the bus was leaving, that was one thing that I saw, which I thought was in bad taste. The other one that I saw were the fans fighting with each other. I saw women being heckled, which felt unsavory, to be very honest. We saw that even in Chennai last year, again, uncalled for. It's not on whatsoever,"" said Uthappa on his YouTube channel.""It has gotten pretty intense. They are holding up jerseys, white T-shirts marked with black lines, stating the two years that CSK were banned for. They have kind of written MS' number on it, and Thala under it, depicting that they were in jail for two years, or whatever. It's getting a little beyond sport which concerns me. Because at the end of the day, this is a sport,"" he added.RCB took a significant step towards securing an IPL playoff spot, while defending champions Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) were eliminated from contention after persistent rain washed out their clash on Saturday, forcing both teams to share points.With 17 points from 12 matches, RCB now sit atop the points table, ahead of second-placed Gujarat Titans (16 points). A win in either of their remaining two fixtures will be enough to confirm their place in the playoffs.RCB are set to host the already-eliminated Sunrisers Hyderabad on May 23, followed by an away game against Lucknow Super Giants on May 27.",Chennai Super Kings were knocked out of the IPL playoff race this season.

Virat Kohli retires from Test cricket after 14 years

NEW DELHI: In the history of Indian sports, only one sportsperson has been honoured with the Bharat Ratna — and that is Sachin Tendulkar . The legendary batter was recommended for the award by the central government in February 2014, and then-President Pranab Mukherjee conferred the honour upon him. No athlete before or since has received this prestigious civilian award.However, former India cricketer Suresh Raina has now called for Virat Kohli to be conferred with the Bharat Ratna, recognising his immense contributions to Indian cricket.""Virat Kohli ne jitni upalabdhiyan haasil ki hain, Bharat aur Bharatiya cricket ke liye unhone jo bhi kiya hai, uske liye unhein Bharat Ratna se sammaanit kiya jana chahiye. Bharat sarkar ko unhein Bharat Ratna award dena chahiye [The number of achievements Virat Kohli has accomplished, and whatever he has done for India and Indian cricket, for that he should be honoured with the Bharat Ratna. The Government of India should give him the Bharat Ratna award],"" Raina said during a show on Star Sports.Kohli recently announced his retirement from Test cricket, putting an end to the speculation around his future in the longest format.The 36-year-old featured in 123 Test matches for India, scoring 9230 runs, including 30 centuries, at an average of 46.85. He will now only play in ODIs, having stepped away from T20 Internationals last year.""As I step away from this format, it's not easy - but it feels right. I've given it everything I had, and it's given me back so much more than I could've hoped for,"" Kohli shared on his Instagram page.""I'm walking away with a heart full of gratitude - for the game, for the people I shared the field with, and for every single person who made me feel seen along the way,"" he added.His exit marks another major retirement in Indian Test cricket, following Ravichandran Ashwin (in December) and Rohit Sharma (last week), who also bid farewell to the format.","Suresh Raina calls for Virat Kohli to be honoured with the Bharat Ratna.

NEW DELHI: MS Dhoni is more than just a cricketer—he is an emotion for millions of fans across India, particularly in Chennai.

Mujhe lagta hai ki sabse zyada fan agar asal wale fan jo hai wo unke hi hai (CSK). Baaki to ye bane banaye hai jo aajkal social media aadha to paid hi chalta hai par ye inke fan jo hai wo asali hai. Inke jo fan hai wo sahi mein fan hai.
