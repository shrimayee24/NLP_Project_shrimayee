Why the Los Angeles Lakers Would Do It

Why the Warriors Would Consider It

Theandare under pressure to make big moves this offseason. After disappointing playoff exits, both teams face tough decisions—and a surprising trade involvingcould be on the table.According to Colin Keane of Sporting News , the Warriors, led by Stephen Curry , Draymond Green, and Jimmy Butler, fell short in the Conference Semifinals against the Minnesota Timberwolves. Their lack of depth and youth was exposed, signaling a need for fresh talent.Built on LeBron James and Luka Doncic, the Lakers also had defensive issues and lost to the Timberwolves in the first round. The front staff has been compelled to explore significant retooling due to their roster imbalance.Here’s the potential deal that could shake up both franchises: Draymond Green (4-time All-Star, defensive anchor)- Dalton Knecht (young sharpshooting wing)- Rui Hachimura (expiring contract)- 2031 first-round draft pick LeBron James , now 40, is still elite, but the Los Angeles Lakers must maximize their championship window.Draymond Green’s defensive versatility and playmaking would immediately elevate their roster.- Defensive Upgrade: Green’s ability to guard multiple positions fixes a major Lakers weakness.- Leadership: His vocal presence and playoff experience would bolster the locker room.- Win-Now Move: Knecht’s potential doesn’t align with the Lakers’ urgency to contend.As writer Colin Keane noted: ""Green would be heartbroken to trade in his Warriors uniform and go somewhere else, but his positive relationship with LeBron has been well-documented.""According to Colin, trading Draymond Green would be emotional, but the Golden State Warriors must plan for life after Curry.- Future Assets: Knecht and the 2031 pick offer long-term upside.- Financial Flexibility: Hachimura’s expiring deal clears future cap space.- Youth Movement: Green’s departure accelerates a rebuild around younger talent.While this specific trade might not be enough, the Warriors should keep an open mind if better offers emerge.Both teams are at a crossroads. The Los Angeles Lakers get a proven winner in Draymond Green, while the Golden State Warriors secure assets for the future. Whether this deal happens or not, one thing is clear: major changes are coming for these franchises.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Golden State Warriors could eye $70 million Boston Celtics point guard to boster squad after unfortunate playoff exit This trade scenario remains speculative, but it highlights the tough choices ahead for both teams.

Tony Romo weighs in on the Travis Kelce-Taylor Swift phenomenon



Tony Romo believes Travis Kelce 's relationship with Taylor Swift is beneficial, asserting ""he’s probably doing less than he used to when he was younger."" Romo suggests the increased media attention masks a quieter lifestyle, arguing, ""it can be a net positive if you look at it closely. ""Former Dallas Cowboys quarterback and current CBS Sports analyst, Tony Romo, offers a unique perspective on the highly publicized relationship between Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce and pop superstar Taylor Swift. Far from viewing it as a distraction, Romo contends that the high-profile romance is a ""net positive"" for Kelce, both professionally and personally.Tony Romo, 45, who himself experienced the spotlight dating Jessica Simpson during his NFL career, suggests that the public perception of Kelce's social life might be misleading. ""People won’t even realize this, but he’s probably doing less than he used to when he was younger,” Romo exclusively told Us Weekly. He elaborates that the frequent photographs of Kelce and Swift dining out merely capture a routine activity, akin to a married couple.“If you get your picture taken going to dinner with your superstar girlfriend, it looks like you’re going out or something. No, he just went to dinner. Almost as if he’s married, going to dinner with his wife or something.He didn’t get photographed when he was going out with his buddies all the time.”According to Romo, the increased media coverage actually belies a more settled existence for the athlete. “He’s far less out there. He’s doing far less things than when he was younger. It’s just the fact that if you’re written about a lot and it’s not about football, some people are always going to think that it plays a role. But the truth is that it can be a net positive if you look at it closely.”Addressing Travis Kelce's statistically modest 2024 season, which saw career lows in touchdowns and receptions, Romo believes it was a natural adjustment to the intense scrutiny. “That was his first whole season being under that microscope,” Romo noted, referencing the start of their relationship in September 2023. “It was the first full season and offseason where the public and the world knew. Like anybody, we all learn through experience and we get wiser. ”Romo expresses full confidence in Kelce's ability to navigate this new level of fame, drawing parallels to his own experiences. “Not that [Kelce] has to do anything,” Romo explained.“The guy is a [future] Hall of Famer who has played at the highest level. He’s won Super Bowls. He’s made some of the biggest plays in the most clutch situations ever. I think he’ll figure things out real quick, even if there was something to figure out. I think everyone should just put their trust in him.” He concluded by adding, “And I think he’s got himself a wonderful, wonderful girlfriend.”On a personal note, Romo, now a father of three, embraces a busy family life, finding comfort and convenience in his Skechers Hands Free Slip-ins®. “Me and my wife are taxi cab drivers these days,” Romo joked.“Going from practice to practice to pickup to games. It’s a blast. It’s really one of the great times in my life doing all of this. That’s where Skechers works because I have the slip-on shoe and can be like, ‘Oh, gotta go to the next one. Oh! Didn’t realize we had another one. Slip it on and go.’”Also Read: Did Travis Kelce just confirm he’s living with Taylor Swift?

Luke Kornet's playoff surge and Boston's financial constraints could pave the way for a Lakers acquisition

The Lakers in Los Angeles are trying to enhance their team with stars like LeBron James and Luka Doncic, and they’re reportedly interested in Boston Celtics center Luke Kornet as a potential new player. Kornet has had some standout moments, particularly in the 2025 playoffs, making him a hot free-agent target. This situation creates extra tension for Celtics fans, as the idea of losing a key player to their historic rivals is quite nerve-wracking during the offseason.During Game 5 of the Eastern Conference Semifinals against the New York Knicks, Luke Kornet put on a fantastic show, scoring 10 points with perfect accuracy, collecting nine rebounds, and achieving a career-high of seven blocks in merely 26 minutes. This performance highlighted his defensive capabilities and his talent for rising to the challenge when it matters.During the 2024–25 NBA season, Kornet put up an average of 6.0 points, 5.3 rebounds, and 1.6 assists each game, boasting a remarkable 66.8% shooting percentage across 73 regular-season games. His playoff performance showcased even more of his skill, as he shot 72.4% from the field.This offseason, the Boston Celtics are facing major financial hurdles, being more than $40 million over the luxury tax and $20 million into the second apron, which results in significant financial penalties.With Kornet becoming an unrestricted free agent, the Celtics could have a hard time holding onto him, especially if other teams make more appealing offers.The Los Angeles Lakers are on the lookout for a dependable center to support LeBron James and Luka Doncic, and they might see Kornet as a perfect match. His skills as a lob threat and rim protector fit right into what the Lakers need. Plus, bringing Kornet on board would not just fill a gap in their lineup but also take away a key player from their rivals, the Celtics.The Lakers aren't flying solo in their pursuit. It seems the Golden State Warriors have their sights set on Kornet too, aiming to strengthen their frontcourt without adding to their luxury tax concerns.Also Read: Caitlin Clark says Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are in ‘vacation mode’ as Indiana Fever fans hope for a surprise game visit Luke Kornet has been performing consistently, and with the Celtics facing financial limits, he’s a top target for teams like the Lakers.

It was around 3 AM in Canada when Damandeep Singh's mobile started buzzing. When he finally woke up, there were hundreds of congratulatory texts about his son, Harvansh Singh Pangalia, getting selected for India’s U-19 squad for the upcoming tour of England ""15-16 ghante truck chalaane ke baad neend kahaan khulti hai (After driving a truck for 15-16 hours, you can't wake up that easily from a mobile's vibration),"" Damandeep told TimesofIndia.com over the phone from Brampton.""There are so many congratulatory messages. It feels good. It brings back so many memories of when Harvansh said 'no' to me about moving to Canada. He was rigid, and he's living his dream,"" said Damandeep.India U-19 wicketkeeper-batter Harvansh Singh hails from Gandhidham, a small town in Gujarat's Rann of Kutch. Growing up, he saw his father, Damandeep Singh, and uncle, Kunwarajeet Singh, who played cricket in their town. Interestingly, both of them were wicketkeepers. Now, Harvansh's family is settled in Canada, where his father drives a truck in Brampton.""My elder brother and I were crazy about cricket. We used to play for the sake of a hobby,"" he recollected.""Even Rajkot is 200 km away from our city. It was only in 2012 when the Saurashtra Cricket Association (SCA) opened an academy in our town. I enrolled Harvansh in it when he was six. He picked up 'keeping from me, as I used to don the gloves as well. But he turned southpaw because of Yuvraj Singh . He's a massive Yuvraj fan and hasn't seen peak Yuvraj, but he was obsessed with the video of him hitting six sixes off Stuart Broad,"" said Damandeep.Damandeep never thought a video of Yuvraj Singh's six sixes would make his son so obsessed with the game that he would vow to represent his country.In 2017, Damandeep decided to move to Canada to join his elder brother and sister, but his son Harvansh refused to leave. He wanted to pursue cricket and was hell-bent on making a name for himself in the sport.""My mother, elder brother, and sister all moved to Canada. My plan was the same, but Harvansh wouldn't agree to leave India. He wanted to pursue his dream of playing for India. My wife, Jaspreet Kaur, and I tried hard to convince him, but he was determined,"" said Damandeep.""Papa India hi khelna hai (I want to play for India only). Many relatives tried hard to make him understand that it would be easier for him to play cricket in Canada because the competition is less there. But he kept on arguing, 'easy kuch bhi nahi chahiye aur jab khelna hi hai toh India ke liye khelunga' (I don't want anything easy in my life, and when I play, I will play for India only).'""After a while, Damandeep and Jaspreet gave up.""I told him, 'Fine, you play your cricket. Let's make a decision after U-19. If you don't get picked for India, then just pack your bags and move to Canada,'"" he said.The family got divided.

Patrick Mahomes Olympic Flag football dream; Can NFL star dominate LA28’s Olympic sport?



Patrick Mahomes has already cemented his status as one of the NFL’s all-time greats with three Super Bowl wins under his belt. Yet, the Kansas City Chiefs superstar is now setting his sights on something far less conventional for a football player: an Olympic gold medal. With flag football officially added to the 2028 Los Angeles Olympic Games, Mahomes’ expressed interest in representing Team USA has ignited a heated conversation about the future of football and the intersection of professional sports with the Olympic movement.In May 2025, NFL owners approved a historic decision of allowing league players to compete in the Olympic flag football tournament at LA28. This marks football’s official entry onto the Olympic stage in a faster, non-contact form that emphasizes agility and skill. But is flag football really a natural fit for NFL stars like Patrick Mahomes, or is it a bridge too far?Mahomes has been candid about the challenges. “There’s the want to, I just don’t know if my skill set is what is required for flag football,” he said. Unlike traditional quarterbacks who often stay in the pocket, flag football demands scrambling, dodging, and nonstop movement. By 2028, Mahomes will be in his early 30s—an age when many players start to slow down. He even joked about possibly joining as a coach or consultant instead, showing respect for the flag football athletes who have been mastering their craft for years.The debate also touches on the unique prestige of Olympic gold. For many American athletes from golf to basketball, an Olympic medal is the ultimate achievement, one that goes beyond professional success. Mahomes chasing Olympic gold suggests he wants to expand his legacy beyond the NFL and earn a truly global honor.Also Read: Dallas Cowboys could sign Amari Cooper after George Pickens trade Critics worry, however, that this could blur the lines between sports and turn the Olympics into a showcase for crossover stars instead of specialists. As LA28 approaches, the spotlight will be on Mahomes and the future of football at the Olympics. Will this be a groundbreaking new chapter or spark ongoing controversy? The game of football is evolving in ways few expected.","NFL star Patrick Mahomes has expressed interest in representing Team USA at LA28.

During the next six seasons, Detroit never finished higher than fifth in division standing. Finally, in 2022, they let him go. His overall record with Detroit by the end of his tenure was 204-261-72, according to NHL.com.Post-Detroit, Blashill found his way to Tampa Bay to become an assistant under Jon Cooper.He was there for three years.Cooper is now the most tenured head coach in the NHL and is highly regarded throughout the league.Also Read: Jeff Blashill Set To Become Next Chicago Blackhawks Head Coach: Report Blackhawks General Manager Kyle Davidson said the team required someone to work with young players.

WWE Superstar Zoey Stark made her comeback to the limelight in a tragic manner on the recent episode of Monday Night RAW. What was supposed to be a critical milestone in her career, Stark got severely injured in her knee in a triple-threat qualifying match for the 2025 Women's Money in the Bank (MITB) ladder match. The incident has not only sidelined her from one of WWE’s most prestigious events but may also signal a prolonged absence from in-ring competition.The accident occurred at the Bon Secours Wellness Arena in Greenville, South Carolina, during a MITB qualifier bout between Zoey Stark, Kairi Sane, and Rhea Ripley. At its climax, Stark tried her characteristic springboard dropkick—a sportslike move that requires agility and accuracy. In targeting Kairi Sane, Stark slipped in executing the springboard, resulting in her awkwardly landing on her right leg.The blow caused her knee to bend in a distinctly unnatural manner, quite visibly startling both supporters and commentators. The match instantly became secondary as paramedics rushed onto the field to treat the hurt athlete. After the botched maneuver, Stark fell to the floor, cradling her right knee and exhibiting obvious signs of pain and distress. The referee stopped the match for a moment and motioned for medical attention. WWE ringside physicians made their way into the ring and evaluated her condition.Despite the extent of the injury, Stark first tried to leave the ring independently. She tried to stand, only to fall again, as she could no longer bear the weight of herself. Eventually, she was assisted backstage by medical personnel, affirming the severity of the ordeal.Veteran WWE play-by-play commentator Michael Cole guessed on-air that Stark may have re-aggravated an old injury. Stark had extensive knee surgery in 2021 to repair a torn ACL, MCL, and meniscus—injuries requiring months of rehabilitation.With the visual similarity and reaction of Stark, there is an increasing fear that her current injury is a recurrence or exacerbation of the same condition of the knee. But to date, WWE has not issued a formal medical diagnosis or recovery timeline. The wrestling fraternity came in support of Stark after the injury. AEW wrestler Thunder Rosa showed her concern with a heartfelt post on social media:""Wrestling is a lovely and risky sport. We leave everything on the table every time we go to the ring, and we also put a lot on the line when we do what we are passionate about. Zoey Stark, I love you, sister, and I hope that you heal soon."" — Thunder Rosa through X (previously Twitter)Zoey Stark's RAW match was her first on television since January. She had last remained an active member of the dissolved faction Pure Fusion Collective, after Sonya Deville and Shayna Baszler left. Stark was competing mainly in non-televised WWE house shows and sporadic Main Event tapings before this return.As a result of her earlier knee damage incurred during her stint in NXT, Stark was drafted to the main roster as part of the 2023 WWE Draft—a testament to how much the WWE believed in her promising future. The MITB qualifier was set to be a career-launching experience, which made her untimely injury so much more heartbreaking.With Stark out, the match went on between the remaining participants. Rhea Ripley took advantage of the situation, overpowering Kairi Sane and finishing the match with her characteristic Riptide finisher. The pinfall win earned Ripley a spot in the upcoming ladder match for Women's Money in the Bank, which is to be held on June 7. Ripley’s victory, however, was overshadowed by the concern surrounding Stark’s health, as WWE fans and analysts alike shifted focus to the severity of the injury.The extent of Stark’s injury remains unconfirmed by WWE, leaving her return date unknown. Given her history of severe knee damage, fans and medical experts fear that she could face another lengthy recovery process. This injury not only removes her from one of WWE’s most career-defining matches but also risks stalling the momentum she had just begun to regain. For now, Zoey Stark’s fans—and the WWE Universe as a whole—await official word from WWE’s medical team.","WWE superstar Zoey Stark suffers a painful knee injury during MITB qualifier match.

Lucknow Super Giants secured a consolation 33-run victory over Gujarat Titans in Ahmedabad on Thursday, powered by Mitchell Marsh's maiden IPL century of 117 runs off 64 balls. The win prevented GT from sealing a top-two spot in the league table, as LSG posted 235 for 2 in their 20 overs while restricting GT to 202 for 9.Mitchell Marsh's innings featured 10 fours and eight sixes, standing as the backbone of LSG's impressive total. He partnered with Aiden Markram for a 91-run opening stand and later added 121 runs with Nicholas Pooran in just 8.3 overs.Nicholas Pooran continued his strong form, scoring his fifth half-century of the season in 23 balls, finishing with an unbeaten 56 off 27 deliveries. Markram contributed 36 runs off 24 balls to the team's cause. LSG's batting performance included a record 17 sixes in an IPL match.

However, both openers failed to convert their starts into substantial innings, falling before the close of the 8th over. Jos Buttler contributed 33 runs off 18 balls before falling to a clever delivery from Akash Singh, who managed to bowl despite injuring and bleeding from his right hand.Shahrukh Khan and Sherfane Rutherford provided hope for GT with an explosive 86-run partnership in just 6.4 overs. Shahrukh scored 57 off 29 balls while Rutherford made 38, but their efforts proved insufficient against the large target. LSG's bowling attack faced some pressure as Akash Deep and Shahbaz Ahmed struggled to contain runs. The team's ground fielding also showed room for improvement.Gujarat Titans, despite already qualifying for the playoffs, missed an opportunity to secure 20 points and strengthen their position in the top two. They will now need to win their final match to maintain their chances of a top-two finish.Punjab Kings and Royal Challengers Bangalore remain in contention for the top position, making the final league matches crucial for playoff positioning.Marsh's century came off 56 balls, with particularly aggressive batting against R Sai Kishore, who had previously been economical in the tournament.

The IPL 2025 contest between Gujarat Titans and Lucknow Super Giants at the Narendra Modi Stadium had a dramatic start. Having won the toss, GT chose to field first. In the second over GT bowler Arshad Khan struggled with his footing and fell twice during the run-up.Arshad had a frightening fall on the first ball of his over. His back foot skidded over the grass, causing him to tumble to the ground in visible pain. The incident drew concern from players and officials alike.After a brief pause, Arshad returned to bowl. However, on the fourth ball of the same over, he fell again in a similar manner and appeared injured, prompting the physios to come onto the field and attend to him.Fortunately, he was not seriously hurt and managed to complete the over, giving away 13 runs.Afterwards, he left the field, with images showing physios applying a spray to his knee — suggesting he may have sustained some damage during the falls.At the toss, GT remained unchanged in their quest to remain in the top-two. LSG, meanwhile, are out of contention to make the playoffs.Gill said, ""We'll bowl first, looks like a good wicket.Will be good to have a target on the board. We want momentum heading into the qualifiers, these two games are going to be equally important. The way we compliment each other is great, we don't have conversations on who will take down the bowlers. No changes.""Lucknow Super Giants skipper Rishabh Pant admitted they would have also bowled first. ""Would have bowled first, looks a good wicket. There is a challenge when you are already eliminated, but we take pride in playing cricket.""As a team, we are trying different options that give ourselves the best chance of winning. Anything that could help us prepare for next season. Akash Deep comes in, and a few more changes for us.""","IPL 2025 match between Gujarat Titans and Lucknow Super Giants had a dramatic start.

Former WWE Champion Jinder Mahal talks wrestling in WXM, John Cena Seth Rollins , and moreThe Times of India journalist and wrestling influencer, Nikunj Walia, spoke with former WWE Champion Jinder Mahal (now known as Raj Dhesi) during his visit to India in an exclusive interview. He came to Mumbai to participate in the wrestling show produced by an emerging company in the country, Wrestling Xtreme Mania (WXM) started by former WWE superstar Jeet Rama, and the interview was also joined by the CEO, Rishi.What's up, wrestling fans in India? This is Nikunj Walia from WrestleFanent and Times of India and joining me today are two pioneers, I would say, or I would say revolutionaries, that are ready to change the game in India with their contributions to this country. We have the Maharaja himself, Raj, and the CEO of a brand-new wrestling company that is ready to make waves in our country. We have Rishi, the CEO of WXM.Guys, welcome. It's a pleasure to have you with us, and I'm really excited to see all of this happening here in India. And, thank you so much for bringing this to India, Raj, Rishi, both. It's awesome, and I think everybody's gonna be excited for what you guys are gonna bring.So let's do this.Okay. So firstly, I want to ask about WXM. So I would like each of you guys to tell me, in your words, what is WXM and how does it change India? Rishi, let's start with you.So I love the enthusiasm by the way. Yeah. It shows that you're a big, big wrestling fan. [Big, big, big, big wrestling fan.] Excellent. So it's the same journey as probably mine. I mean, we've all sort of grown up on watching wrestling on TVs. Sort of followed all popular moves, suplexes, DDT on our beds or in the playground, [the khalas], yes, the khalas. So that's been my journey. I've been a big, big fan, and finally sort of met Jeet, heard about his vision, what he wanted to do in India. That's when we collaborated, and the vision is very clear.We want to be we are, and we want to be India's biggest pro wrestling platform, giving opportunities to all the young budding wrestlers that we have here, making pro wrestling a career option for a lot of budding wrestlers, and also creating a talent hub because it's not just about what you see on screen for the wrestlers, but also backstage. There's a big creative hub that we want to create. And that's where sort of WXM is collaborating with some of the best minds across the world, both globally and from India.Awesome. Raj, in your words, WXM.Yeah. To me, India's homegrown promotion/ platform, what I like to see in the future is the Indian talent being highlighted as equal to foreign talent, which already we've done a great job mixing up the two talent because sometimes what happens is you get foreign talent versus foreign talent and less experienced local talent versus local talent, but not in this case. The local talent that we have here in WXM, they have a world class facility to train at, both in-ring, gym, nutrition, physical therapy. Like, this is unlike anywhere in the world where they can, really apply themselves to their craft, to their craft and then test themselves against the best wrestlers from all across the world. And, just the production value, the talent roster, everybody backstage is is like one big family. I love coming here. This is actually my first time wrestling in Mumbai ever, so I'm really looking forward to it. But, definitely, the future here in W, sorry, in India is WXM.Definitely, and you know, everything you just said, I totally agree because, like, all of you guys have been a fan whole my life. Life. But never ever have I seen anything like this in India, what WXM is gonna bring about. Alright. So let's move on to the next question. So, Rishi, you have just answered some of my things that I wanted to ask next, but still I'll ask you. So, of course, you all said that we were fans and, you know, we had this fandom spirit. But apart from the fandom spirit, what was that extra motivation that you said, okay, I'm done being a fan. I wanna jump in the revolution. I wanna change the country, like this sport in my country, so please.Just reflecting on my own journey honestly. So as a fan, I could never … I mean, probably with my body, I wanted to be a professional wrestler, but sort of didn't know what to do about it. How can you go to that? Is there any platform in India? Lack of knowledge, lack of expertise, and just no facilities out there. So that dream sort of drifted apart, did nothing, went on with my career, life and everything. But sort of pro wrestling was my passion. It sort of always kept creeping back into it and social media sort of helped me gain some interest back into it because, sometimes with the weight of responsibility, your passion sways away and and that's what happened, and that's what happens with most of the cases.The Indian word it's called a Kira.Kira. Yeah. So that Kira was always in me and social media luckily sort of helped me get that back in. And that's when I decided that I should, you know, quit all these mundane things that I'm doing, get into this exciting life … we definitely wanted to create a platform which becomes a place for the young budding talent to come perform, get trained, get developed. I think Raj touched upon it.I mean, we've opened up a Performance Center which hosts some of the best of the coaches who can train these guys. We look after their nutrition, their health, their performance, their training. So everything is sort of being taken care of and it gives a platform for any young athlete at the age of 13, 14 wanting to do something in this field, a platform to sort of go there and perform out there. So that was our vision and we know that this talent existed in India and that's why we've got best of the 25 wrestlers right now, competing with some of the best from across the world, [pointing at Raj] from across the world.The best from India, I would say.The best. The best, of course. Yeah. So I mean, he's an idol for a lot of the guys over here. He he is aware of that and yeah, So it's it's sometimes difficult for these guys to poof. Yeah. But ... some action is brewing. Yeah.You you just talked about, you know, changing history, and let's then move on to the history maker. Raj, of course, there's no denying that you are a history maker. The first ever, you know, person from an Indian descent to win the World championship on a grand stage in WWE. You did that. So, of course, I'm gonna touch base on everything that's going on, but let's touch base on what's happened in the past. So, you know, I want to, like, hear your mindset that when you held that WWE championship high in the air, how did you feel and, you know, what was that moment like to you and how did you feel exactly?Yeah. So that moment … was like my childhood dream. The earliest memories of me watching wrestling, watching Bret The Hitman Hart, then growing up and watching Undertaker, Mick Foley, The Rock, Stone Cold Steve Austin, on and on. On to guys like John Cena and Randy Orton , who I got to share the ring with, just winning that championship.The main purpose of this, as you mentioned, the first-ever WWE champion of Indian descent, of South Asian, descent. Anything, any which way you wanna put it. Just what that means to the next generation coming up. Because now that someone did it, that means others will do it. You know, it's it's never been done until somebody does it. And that just that weight of that moment, it weighs a lot on me because I know that's gonna inspire the next generation of athletes from all over the world of the Indian diaspora, you know, it's very, very big across the world. Not just India, we have, you know, Indian heritage all across the world, all across Europe, Australia. Everywhere I go, I see Indian fans.They all love wrestling. Wrestling is like the universal language for all of us. For some reason, it's in our blood. You called it the Kira earlier. Exactly. So just providing the inspiration for the next generation, But along with WXM, now they have the platform, the training facility, and hopefully soon that … the whether it's a television show or what what whatever, that's our goal, hopefully. That that platform to broadcast ourselves all across India and become household names.Okay. Great. So, speaking of WXM, let's come back there again. So, how does it feel, Rishi, that you will have a superstar like Raj representing this company at the highest level? You know, the one of the top stars, I will say, in the foreign lands, of course, in India. So, how does it feel to have Raj represent your country? Oh, sorry. WXM at this stage?I mean, it's a privilege and an honor to sort of have him on board with us, honestly. What you've just talked about, I mean, he's represented India, worldwide, made us all proud, been the only sort of heavyweight champion for the world, from an Indian descent or from a South Asian descent. It's an absolute honor to have him on board on WXM and the guidance, the training, the help that he's providing us, the expertise that he's sort of lending to us through his experience and wisdom is an absolute privilege. So, Raj, I mean, it's it's been a great collaboration and, of course, we have a long way to go together definitely.And it's gonna really explode on the big stage. Okay. So coming back to some past things, like I said, I'm gonna ask for past stuff as well. So, I wanna take you back to 2024 when, you know, you had a great run and some it slowed down. And then 2024, again, you were picking up pace. And I remember this one match that you had with Seth “Freakin” Rollins on Raw that really garnered a lot of attention for you [Yes]. So I would like to ask your opinions, how was it to share the ring with somebody who's as talented as Seth Rollins and like, how what do you feel about his in-ring acumen and, you know, sharing the ring?Yeah. Yeah. So we picked up momentum on January 1 Day One with The Rock. I got to be on the microphone with The Rock and I just gained some momentum out of that because I don't think, WWE, when they wrote the segment, were anticipating such a positive response in my favor or the performance that I delivered. And then I gained a little momentum that I did another promo with Seth. After the promo with The Rock, one of the writers called me. He said, hey, we want you to wrestle Seth for the World Heavyweight Championship.And anytime you get to wrestle for the World Heavyweight Championship, you know, it's always an honor. But before that, I was managing Indus Sher, I wasn't as active as a wrestler, but luckily, I stayed in shape. So when the call came to do the World Heavyweight Championship match, I was ready. And, yes, Seth is one of the best performers across the world.We have such a deep history. The first-ever NXT championship match was between Seth Rollins and me, so we have a lot of history going back many years. But, yeah, he's a great talent, and that was a great opportunity for me to have one last World Heavyweight Championship match.So this is like a fun question. I you can skip it if you want to. So just right after this, the fans on social media, of course, like, you know, there's one big executive that say the social media fans are, like, not the real fans. Yeah. But those like, in that social media thing, I noticed that there was some back and forth with AEW President Tony Khan and you. So I couldn't really stop by asking this, but I just wanted to see what was going on there and what was on your mind. So But it won't in your favor, I have to say.It worked in both of our favor. Okay. Because they got buzzed. I believe HOOK had a World Heavyweight Championship match on AEW, and I had one against Seth Rollins. Yeah. So we, all were it all worked in everybody's favor. So buzz, you know, I know I've heard this before that any press is good press, essentially as long as people are talking. But I have no hard feelings. Pro Wrestling is one big family. Like, wherever I can lend my services, my support, my whatever knowledge or expertise I have, like, here with as Rishi mentioned, I would love I just wanna give back to the business because the business has given me so much. It's time for me now to give back. Many of our young athletes here in WXM, they have so many questions. They're so enthusiastic.Just everything about wrestling across the world, wrestling on television. Hey. How was your match with Randy Orton John Cena, Undertaker, etcetera right? And I think it's important for them to, you know, see me in person or someone like me or some other international level talents because it makes them realize that this dream is possible for us also.Like, we are no I'm no different than any of them where they are that's where I was maybe fifteen years ago, right, in my journey. So, it's about giving back to me at this point.And it's so great, like, somebody who's as experienced as you and, you know, having a WXM team. Yes. Give these guys so much and, you know, something that they have never ever got. They've just seen it on television. They just heard about it. It's really great that you're doing everything for our country. There's one last thing I'm gonna ask, about your WWE championship win, then we're gonna move forward to WXM. When you won the championship, I want to know what then- WWE CEO and Chairman Vince McMahon had to say about it, about your run, about your victory [Yeah] What was his reaction?So he was very happy. Leading up to that, I was at the right place, at the right time, and with the right preparation. I got drafted to SmackDown, and there was no plan for me to face Randy Orton. It was supposed to be Rusev vs Randy Orton[Woah] and Rusev got hurt. Okay. So Rusev was out and on that time on SmackDown, maybe I was the next heel in line, and I got put in the match, the six-pack challenge match, became number one contender.But Randy told me about a week or two before the pay-per-view match that, Rusev is coming back and Randy is gonna wrestle Rusev for the championship match. So most likely, it's just one pay-per-view. But something changed my confidence. Everything about me changed. I rose up to become the level of caliber wrestler of World Champion, WWE champion. Something changed, and, last minute, unexpectedly, I won the WWE championship and exactly the same way I lost the WWE championship, very short on, like, one day … type things, AJ Styles beat me in Manchester. I don't think anybody was expecting a title change. But that's the great thing with pro wrestling. When you can do it, there's so many surprises and there's so many stories to tell. It's a great form of entertainment.Okay. Rishi, I wanna ask you. So now that we have stars like Raj, we have Dijak, we have Chris Masters, we have Samuel, you know, like, these all these big names coming to WXM, any more names would you like to tease maybe or, you know, give a hint that that could follow suit to WXM soon? Like, any teaser can we expect?I think you'll experience it all at WXM Ground Zero Powerbomb. Yeah. So I wouldn't want to reveal anything right now, but some of these names that you mentioned, they've been all great and that was one of the efforts that we wanted to do. We wanted to bring in different styles of wrestling as well. So Raj has sort of represented all over the world. We got some Japanese pro wrestlers, Mexican style. So we've got all different styles, coming in and, of course, our own style over here, which our roster will showcase.Raj, I want to ask, with WXM now that you've become an integral part, it's like it's like a very, you know, hard-hitting question. So just be honest about it. So, do you think that WXM is the answer to the future of pro wrestling in India?Yeah. I definitely do, especially with, now the opening up of pro wrestling on a … national television. We all know WWE went to Netflix. But not only that, just something has been brewing in India for many, many years. The level of passion, the desire for pro wrestling in India for its own home promotion is again, as I mentioned, when I won the championship, it was timing. It was preparation … met that that opportunity. Right? And the same thing here with WXM. And a huge investment … on their part, the team's part, WXM team's part, huge investment. The talent is ready. The talent is hungry. They're well trained. If you see them, you'll be blown away by their presence, their confidence, just the way they perform. I was blown away. And now the timing is perfect. So those three things, I think now is a time for WXM to really make its mark.Well, I'm really excited because, you know, I've seen some of the talents perform at some of our WrestleFanent at events. You know, they have blown away fans. You know, like, I remember there was this one, WrestleFanent event where some of your guys were performing, and there was this another celebrity that was supposed to come, but the fans were so into it. They said that we don't wanna meet the international star. We wanna see this. Yeah. We wanna see how these Indian guys are doing it in the ring, and I was blown up. And that's when I realized that there is an opportunity that somebody has to capitalize. So it's great that you guys are doing that.Now it's a combined question for both of you. I'd like to have an opinion about something that's really prevalent in the wrestling world today. So I don't know if you guys saw WrestleMania 41. There was this one superstar who broke a record. You probably might know him. His name is John Cena. Of course, you have shared the ring with him. So I want to … it's like a trick question here. So how did you feel to watch Cena, you know, embrace that hate and win the championship like he did? And would you also do something like that in WXM to rise to the very top?So I was excited to watch it. John Cena, heel turn. It's something fresh, something new. Again, as I mentioned, there's so many, surprises in pro wrestling, so many stories you can tell. So I was very happy to see that, but would I do anything? Probably at this stage in my career, I wouldn't. I'm about giving back to the business. I'm not gonna be so selfish, But, yeah, I'm I'm about giving back. But, again, if anybody wants a fair match, I, of course, wanna become WXM champion also, but I will do it this time the right way without the help of the Singh Brothers. I will do it myself.Yeah. This is … I was I'm really surprised by this answer because the Jinder Mahal or the Raj, I know, he would do anything to win the championship, but okay. That's a really great approach that we're gonna see very well. Rishi, what about you?Honestly, my life for the last few years has just been WXM. So I haven't really been following all of this, but I have heard about this. No opinion per se, honestly. I know the heel turn sort of happened. Creative decision works well, honestly, gets a lot of buzz, but, from a creative perspective, yes. Great storyline. But I guess sort of Raj gave his opinion whether he would be comfortable doing that or not. Well, you got the answer then.Raj, I wanted to ask. So, like, you are more prevalent in the foreign shows. Like, you're wrestling over there. You were all over Las Vegas in the WrestleMania week and, you know, everything. So if you had to choose, like … to sign permanently with the promotion [Yeah] Who would that be? Will it be permanently? Like, you know, like, I'm committed to this. I'm gonna do this. Will it be WWE? Will it be AEW? Will it be TNA? Or will it be WXM?WXM, India is my favorite place to wrestle. You can ask any wrestler, foreign wrestler who's ever wrestled in India. They will tell you this is the best place to wrestle. The respect, the love that you get from the fans, from not only anywhere you go, everywhere. From soon as I touch it down in the airport, people come up to me so excited to see me. Nowhere in the world is like that. Only in India. This is the best country. This is the best place. Most love, most passion, most viewership, all the records are here in India. Best food.Oh, best food? What's your favorite Indian cuisine that I would like to ask?Favorite … any Punjabi style. Yeah, Aloo paranthe … Yeah, Punjabi food is my favorite.I think just to add to that, so definitely embracing the Indian culture. That's a big thing because, I mean, we are so giving. As fans, we are so loyal. We love our superstars so much. We sort of treat them. We idealize them, and that's what sort of I've been through, probably you've also been through. So all these guys feel so special when they come here and some of the things that the feedback that I get, I mean, I feel so happy about it. Plus, of course, the kind of sort of production that we are putting out there. I think they are super, super impressed about what's out there and it's up there with the best of the best. So, it has all the potential,ntial and we are out there.Yeah. I saw it and it was fantastic. I just and we were sweep by feet. I think it's gonna be really great. Okay. I have a very interesting question for you, Rishi. So in the past, you have seen in wrestling promotions that CEO also gets into the ring, has some, you know, bumps and shots and things like that. So can we expect Rishi to be like a Vince McMahon kind of a CEO where he is gonna take some, you know, shots or, like, bumps and, like, maybe like a storyline, like, where you are the CEO and, you know, Raj gets his hands on you and, you know, probably give you a Khallas or something like that. Can we can we see that?I mean, I definitely don't want Khallas from him. Okay. That's that's the sign putting out there. Okay. And, you know, with this, I'll be obviously gone. But, never say never. Yeah. Let's see let's see what happens. Not going by any references, but whatever sort of creative choices we make, as long as sort of it resonates and it sort of, is for the right reasons, I'll be open for it.Alright. And the last question, Raj, I have for you. So now that we all are here for the Ground Zero Powerbomb event, it's gonna be a fantastic show. I'm very sure about that. So what is your mindset heading into WXM Ground Zero Powerbomb tomorrow? And what can the Indian wrestling fans and people watching all over the world expect from the Maharaja of wrestling in this show?Yeah. I'm gonna give it my best because I know I'm representing India, the 1.4 Billion … not only that, I'm excited for the local wrestlers, the local trainees, the Indian talent, the homegrown talent to rise up and show the world, show India what they're capable of. And of course, we have the production value, we have everything, we have a beautiful venue. The production is incredible, world-class. So just looking forward to having the best show possible and then doing it again very soon.Please do that in Delhi because I … you know, you must ask some of your WXM people. They came to our fan meet and something and Delhi fans were really complaining about this. That why isn't there a show in the capital city? Why all everything happens in Mumbai. So it's not a request. It's a warning. You wanna feel the wrath of the fans?Nikunj, this is just the start. Okay? Just a start. We are creating a live events ecosystem here in India. And we are all out there to show our Jigra to the world tomorrow, and this will continue.Awesome. Awesome. Okay. So before we wrap up the interview, so there's a special request from the fan base of Wrestlefanent, wrestling community all over India. So we have a championship belt. Like, in India, of course, the fans cannot wrestle like you guys, but we give them the opportunity to compete for championship belts in different type of competitions like gaming. There's trivia challenges about superstars, wrestlers all across the world. And we have got our WFE championship belt, and it's a request from all the fans for Raj if you can sign it for them. Of course. And, before we wrap up this interview.[Of course]. It would be really great if you can sign that.That's a cool belt.Thank you so much. Not as great as the WXM belt, of course, but just trying to give back my part to the community and, you know, just trying to do my bit for Pro Wrestling in India.Raj, would you like to put it on your shoulder once? Like this I know it's not that good of a belt, but okay. It looks really cool on you.I have to say it looks really great on you. On that note, I'm gonna be signing off.

David Adelman appointed as head coach for Denver Nuggets

We are going to be moving forward with David Adelman as our head coach for next season and beyond. I think the way that the group really rallied around him, and not only a different voice, but a different style of communication, was fantastic to see.

We are really excited about him, both what he’s shown over the last six weeks and then having a full summer, a full training camp and a full year to get things under his belt before we go back at it again this time next year

“I think a lot of our answers are internal right now,

""With where we are from a roster standpoint, we have guys locked into contracts. We’re going into a coaching transition. And to be frank, that’s a huge change. Huge change. … DA’s philosophy, how he might use these guys slightly differently, there’s gonna be a lot of big changes throughout our organization already,"" he said.

The Denver Nuggets have made a big decision ahead of a very important offseason. After being knocked out by the Oklahoma City Thunder in Game 7, the team has chosen David Adelman as their full-time head coach. Adelman had taken over temporarily after head coach Michael Malone and General Manager Calvin Booth were both fired just before the 2025 NBA playoffs.Even though some people were surprised by the sudden firing, David Adelman has done a pretty decent job. Adelman worked closely with star player Nikola Jokic and let him help lead the team. Under Adelman, the Denver Nuggets managed to secure their last three regular-season games, and beat the LA Clippers in the first playoff round, and almost made it to the Western Conference Finals.Team president Josh Kroenke said he chose to keep David Adelman as head coach to help the Denver Nuggets remain strong. The team still doesn’t have a permanent general manager, but Kroenke believes Adelman can guide them back to the top. Adelman has now officially taken over as the Nuggets' new head coach.Kroenke said, “He added, “.”"" said Kroenke.Also Read: NBA Trade Rumors: Denver Nuggets Expected To Part Ways With Michael Porter Jr. After Playoff Failure Now, one can look out for a solid performance this season from the Denver Nuggets, with the new changes in place.","Denver Nuggets' president Josh Kroenke confirms appointment of David Adelman as head coach.

Oklahoma City Thunder game summary

The Oklahoma City Thunder has proved once again that they are in the playoff finals for a back-to-back win. On Thursday, May 22nd, the Thunder secured a stunning 118-103 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves at their home ground, Paycom Center in Oklahoma City, to lead the series 2-0. Here is the box score, player stats, game summary, and everything you need to know about the Minnesota Timberwolves vs Oklahoma City Thunder matchup.The Minnesota Timberwolves leaned heavily on Anthony Edwards , who poured in 32 points and grabbed 9 rebounds. Despite his strong scoring, the team struggled from three-point range, hitting just 11 of 39 attempts. Jaden McDaniels added 22 points with solid shooting, but their offense lacked rhythm without consistent support from the bench.Nickeil Alexander-Walker gave a much-needed boost, scoring 17 points off the bench on just eight shots. However, the Timberwolves’ 14 turnovers and poor three-point shooting cost them crucial momentum. With Mike Conley shooting just 16.7% from the floor, the backcourt couldn’t offer enough to keep the team in the game.Shai Gilgeous-Alexander powered the Thunder to a 118-point night with 38 points on 57.1% shooting.He was unstoppable at the line, hitting 13 of 15 free throws, and added 8 assists and 3 steals.

Saquon Barkley shuts down critics saying it’s not just an Eagles thing

Philadelphia Eagles running back Saquon Barkley continues to make headlines, not just for his on-field talent, but for his outspoken takes on some of the NFL’s hottest topics. In a recent interview alongside teammates Reed Blankenship and Cooper DeJean, Barkley tackled the controversy surrounding the Eagles’ signature “Tush Push” play and also spoke candidly about the broader issues affecting NFL players, including guaranteed contracts and player safety.A clip from their conversation, shared on Instagram, shows Saquon Barkley passionately defending the Tush Push against criticism. During the discussion, Barkley highlighted how the Philadelphia Eagles have simply mastered a play that anyone in the league is free to run. He emphasized that the move isn’t some secret or unfair advantage, just a well-executed strategy.“I think it's soft. Everybody can do it. Like it’s not like a play that only we can do. Everybody can do. It’s not trademarked. They’re not successful with it. So it’s not something that everyone can’t do, right? Like, don’t try to eliminate it. I think that’s kind of lame,” he said.Barkley also pointed out the hypocrisy in the criticism. “I mean, it’s gonna be less than 30. Everybody can do it, there’s no health issue,” he argued, pushing back on concerns that the play poses safety risks. His stance? If others can run the same play but fail, the problem isn’t with the rulebook, it’s with execution.But Barkley didn’t stop there. He pivoted to a much bigger issue that affects every player in the league, contract guarantees. Speaking directly to his younger teammates, he said, “That don’t bother you guys? Like for you guys, who are younger, especially you, who’s the youngest one of all of us, there’s gotta be a point. There’s no reason why we put our bodies on the line, our minds, our brains on the line. It should be fully guaranteed. In my opinion.”Despite growing pressure to outlaw the Eagles' signature “Tush Push” play, the NFL recently voted to keep it legal. A proposal led by the Green Bay Packers to ban the play fell short, missing the required 24 votes needed for approval. This decision means the controversial tactic will remain in play for the 2025 season, despite calls from some teams to eliminate it due to concerns over fairness and player safety. The narrow vote reflects how divided the league remains on whether dominance through execution should be limited by rule changes.Also read: Pat McAfee might be Hollywood’s next wildcard and Tom Cruise just became his surprise mentor In a few powerful minutes, Barkley defended one of the league’s most debated plays and also used his platform to call out the lack of financial security for players who risk everything every time they step on the field. With statements like these, it’s clear Barkley’s leadership goes far beyond the game itself.","Philadelphia Eagles running back Saquon Barkley defended the Tush Push against criticism.

'Chances are still there': Abishek Porel believes in IPL 2025 playoff miracle

NEW DELHI: Gujarat Titans skipper Shubman Gill admitted that conceding extra runs proved costly in their 33-run defeat to Lucknow Super Giants at home on Thursday. Despite having already secured a place in the playoffs, the Titans struggled to contain LSG, who piled on a massive 235/2, led by Mitchell Marsh ’s scintillating maiden IPL century — a 117-run blitz off just 64 balls.Gill pointed to the bowling effort in the latter stages as the turning point. “We gave 15-20 extra. If we'd stopped them (LSG) at 210-220 it would've been better, that was a huge difference,” he said, underlining the need for a course correction heading into the playoffs.Gujarat got off to a strong start in their chase but lost momentum in the 17th over when Sherfane Rutherford and Rahul Tewatia departed in quick succession, handing the advantage to the visitors.When asked if choosing to bowl first was a strategic decision to test playoff preparedness, Gill dismissed the notion. “No, honestly. We bowled well in the powerplay. Yes, we didn't get wickets. But they (LSG) scored 180 in the next 14 overs, which was a lot. We were right in the game till the 17th over. Shahrukh and Rutherford batted well. Getting the momentum back will be key in the next game.”GT will now aim to bounce back in their final league game against Chennai Super Kings at the same venue on May 25.Meanwhile, Player of the Match Mitchell Marsh expressed delight over his long-awaited IPL century, having been part of the tournament since 2010.""I actually first played for the Deccan Chargers, it's been a long journey. Happy to contribute tonight. Being given the opportunity to open, the partnership with (Aiden) Markram has helped me,” Marsh said.Reflecting on LSG’s campaign, Marsh acknowledged the ups and downs but remained hopeful of ending on a positive note.""We haven't had the best of seasons but the last two games are still important. I thought they bowled well early on. T20s these days, if you're 12 off 12 and not time it well, it's panic stations. But today showed you can bat through and go on to stitch big partnerships,” he added.",Gujarat Titans lose by 33 runs to Lucknow Super Giants. Mitchell Marsh scores maiden IPL century for LSG.

IPL 2025: The unsung heroes of India's T20 league

LUCKNOW: Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB), who have already qualified for the playoffs, will pursue victories against the two eliminated teams, SRH and LSG, in their remaining league games. First up are SRH on Friday.RCB have been runners-up three times, in 2009, 2011, and 2016, and have qualified for the playoffs nine times but are yet to win their maiden IPL title. The SRH game is a good opportunity for them to secure a spot in the top two for the first time in nine years.The match was shifted from Bengaluru to Lucknow because of unfavourable weather conditions in the south. The Rajat Patidar-led team secured their playoff spot following Gujarat Titans’ win against Delhi Capitals.RCB were in fine form prior to the league’s disruption due to the military conflict and the side had strung together four consecutive wins before a washout in Bengaluru.A day before the game, RCB’s head coach Andy Flower — formerly with Lucknow Super Giants — inspected the red soil pitch along with a local curator, while Virat Kohli was seen engaged in an intense nets session.Kohli, who just announced his Test retirement, is the fifth-highest run scorer this season, with seven fifties at a strike rate of 143.46.Asked if the break would disrupt the team’s momentum, Flower said, “For a couple of our players, the break has been healthy. Rajat Patidar for one. It’s given his right hand a little bit of time to settle after getting quite a bad knock. So he is fit to bat.”SRH have had a forgettable season and will now seek to disrupt RCB’s campaign.","Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) have already qualified for the playoffs.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

Delhi Results 2025: 'LinkedIn Lessons' from Brand BJP's win and Brand AAP's loss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-results-2025-linkedin-lessons-from-brand-bjps-win-and-brand-aaps-loss/articleshow/118066797.cms,"AAP: From Disruptor to Establishment to Decline



AAP was the ultimate political startup—the kind that raises Series A, B, and C funding at record speed, becomes a unicorn, and then implodes under its own weight. It was supposed to be the alternative to traditional politics, the fresh face in a crowded market, a party that rejected caste, religion, and dynasty-driven politics.

But somewhere along the way, it stopped being a startup and started behaving like an old-school corporate giant—bloated, bureaucratic, and overconfident.

1) From Lean & Agile to Bureaucratic & Slow

AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach—the political equivalent of a D2C brand shaking up a legacy market.

Over time, it became centralized and top-heavy, with decision-making confined to a handful of leaders. MLAs became inaccessible, the leadership became distant, and ground-level mobilization weakened. No succession planning. Kejriwal remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force.

remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force. The result? Voters saw it as just another party, not the disruptor it once was.

2) A Reputation Built on Ethics, Lost to Scandals

AAP built its brand on fighting corruption—but its own leadership got embroiled in one of the biggest scandals of its time, the liquor policy scam.

Manish Sisodia, Sanjay Singh, and even Kejriwal himself faced corruption allegations, undoing years of anti-corruption positioning.

The Sheesh Mahal controversy—where Kejriwal’s residence was allegedly renovated with ₹45 crore of taxpayer money—completely shattered the “humble leader” narrative.

AAP’s response? Defensive, aggressive, and dismissive. Instead of damage control, it doubled down on denial—a classic PR blunder.

The perception shift was swift and brutal—from “anti-corruption warriors” to just another power-hungry political entity.

3) Ignoring the Middle-Class Voter That Built Its Base

AAP was originally the party of the middle class—frustrated taxpayers who wanted clean governance and economic relief.

Over time, its focus shifted to freebies and populist policies, leaving the middle class feeling ignored.

BJP stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters.

stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters. Kejriwal’s pre-election outreach to the middle class felt forced and last-minute—while BJP had already solidified its positioning.

Takeaway ? A business (or party) that forgets its core customer will eventually lose them.

4) Blaming External Factors Instead of Owning Failures

For 10 years, AAP blamed the Centre, the LG, and opposition parties for everything.

The “victim card” was effective in the early years but wore thin by 2025—voters expected governance, not excuses.

BJP flipped this weakness into an advantage, promising that with a BJP-led government, there would be no Centre-state conflicts, leading to “seamless governance.”

The narrative changed from “AAP vs. BJP” to “AAP vs. Results.” Lesson? Leaders who constantly shift blame instead of delivering solutions lose credibility.

5) Strategic Missteps and Lack of Political Alliances

AAP contested separately from Congress, which led to a split in the anti-BJP vote.

Rahul Gandhi’s direct attacks on Kejriwal made matters worse—AAP was getting hit from both sides.

Internal conflicts weakened the party further. Atishi and Saurabh Bharadwaj were seen as Kejriwal’s successors, but there was no clear transition strategy.

BJP: A Masterclass in Strategic Adaptation

BJP’s 2025 win in Delhi was not a Modi-centric sweep but a well-calibrated organizational comeback. After a lackluster 2024 Lok Sabha performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader.

performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader. Unlike AAP, BJP adapted, restructured, and executed flawlessly.

1) Moving Beyond Modi Dependency

BJP understood that Delhi’s electorate needed a more localized approach.

Instead of making the election about Modi, it focused on governance, urban issues, and direct voter engagement.

No CM face? It didn’t matter. The party projected collective leadership instead of relying on one individual.

By decentralizing its campaign, BJP looked more stable and future-ready.

2) Adopting AAP’s Own Strategies Against It

BJP neutralized AAP’s welfare advantage—promising free electricity, continued subsidies, and additional financial support for women.

Middle-class tax reliefs were announced just before the elections, ensuring they won over voters that AAP had neglected.

The manifesto focused on real urban issues—pollution control, traffic congestion, and infrastructure—exactly what AAP had failed to address convincingly.

Lesson? The best way to beat a competitor is to adopt their strengths while exposing their weaknesses.

3) Letting Congress Do The Attacking



BJP didn’t need to attack AAP aggressively—Rahul Gandhi and Congress did that for them.

By letting AAP and Congress fight it out, BJP consolidated its voter base while the opposition split.

AAP’s credibility suffered more because the attacks came from within the anti-BJP camp.

A strategic win, without unnecessary effort.

4) A Disciplined, Focused, and Well-Executed Campaign

BJP stayed on message, focusing on corruption, governance, and economic stability.

The campaign was structured and well-planned, unlike AAP’s which seemed reactive and disorganized.

The promise to investigate AAP’s corruption cases resonated with voters, reinforcing BJP’s stance on accountability.

In business terms? BJP had a clear marketing strategy, strong brand positioning, and flawless execution.

5) Final Takeaways

Adaptability is key. BJP recalibrated after its 2024 Lok Sabha setbacks, while AAP remained stagnant.

Brand trust is fragile. AAP built its image on honesty but lost credibility due to scandals and mismanagement.

Execution matters more than rhetoric. BJP delivered a disciplined, well-structured campaign.

Leadership succession planning is critical. AAP failed to build second-line leadership, while BJP showcased organizational depth.

Voters reward governance, not excuses. After a decade in power, AAP’s blame game no longer worked.

Politics, like business, rewards those who adapt, execute, and deliver.

Ah, another election, another flood of LinkedIn wisdom posts—where every poll result is a ""case study,"" every political leader is a ""CEO,"" and every campaign is an ""MBA-level lesson in leadership."" Some call it democracy, but on LinkedIn, it’s all about business jargon and corporate analogies.So, let’s break this down the LinkedIn way.BJP, on the other hand, had a structured, disciplined campaign with clear messaging and no internal rifts. In politics and business, a divided team rarely wins.","AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach.

Virat Kohli retires from Test cricket after 14 years

'Iyer a caring captain'

JAIPUR: Virat Kohli made the biggest impact on the Test stage and the format will sorely miss him, feels former Australia cricketer Brad Haddin, now assistant coach of Punjab Kings.Former wicketkeeper-batter Haddin, who had some heated exchanges with Kohli in the past, says Kohli’s passion for the high-stakes moments made him stand out.""It was just his willingness to compete,"" Haddin told TOI in an exclusive interaction. ""Kohli was a once-in-a-generation player and he changed the way the game was played with how he presented himself physically. The thing that drew Australians to Kohli was his sheer passion for the big moments.""He enjoyed coming up against teams like Australia, South Africa and England when they were at their peak and it brought the best out of him,"" Haddin said.Kohli’s captaincy debut in the 2014 Adelaide Test was marked by confrontations with both Mitchell Johnson and Haddin. The batter responded with twin centuries to showcase his resilience and dogged ability to chase victory, though India eventually faltered.""He’s going to be sorely missed in Test cricket. I think that was his greatest format, where he had the biggest impact,"" Haddin said.Haddin, who has been with the Punjab Kings franchise since 2022, also praised captain Shreyas Iyer for his leadership role.""One thing that impressed me is his care for his playing group.

'Shubman Gill used his brains a lot more than the other guys'

AHMEDABAD: The results might not be going in their favour but the Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) openers have ensured swift, solid starts at the top of the order. This season, openers Aiden Markram and Mitchell Marsh have shared five half-century alliances and one 100-run partnership.On Thursday against the Gujarat Titans here, Markram (36 off 24b; 3x4, 2x6) and Marsh (117 off 64b; 10x4, 8x6) again provided the fireworks, and along with Nicholas Pooran (56 off 27b; 4x4, 5x6), powered the visitors to a formidable 235/2.In reply, GT could only manage 202/9, with the in-form top order failing to carry the game deep. Eventually it fell to Shahrukh Khan (57 off 29; 5x4, 3x6) and Sherfane Rutherford to make a match of it, but GT eventually fell short by 33 runs, folding for 202/9. The star of the show with the ball for LSG was Will O' Rourke (3/27), who got rid of Sai Sudharsan upfront and then Rutherford and Tewatia. Avesh Khan and Ayush Badoni too got among the wickets. LSG have now defeated GT both times this season.O'Rourke had Sudharsan caught by Markram at mid-off while Avesh (2/51) got Gill caught brilliantly by Abdul Samad at long-off. Jos Buttler (33 off 18b, 3x4, 2x6) threatened for a while to break loose but was deceived by left-arm pacer Akash Singh's slow inswinger and was bowled.The untested Titans middle-order of Rutherford (38 off 22b; 1x4, 3x6) and Shahrukh showed promise, with the duo adding 86 runs for the fourth wicket.With 54 runs needed off 24 balls, the Titans smelt a chance. But, once O' Rourke had Rutherford caught at deep midwicket by substitute fielder Ravi Bishnoi, the rest of the Titans' innings just petered out.Earlier, Marsh and Markram got off the blocks quickly as LSG reached 22 after two overs. Three sedate overs followed before Markram took the toll off Kagiso Rabada by smashing him for two sixes over the leg-side boundary as the visitors raced to 53 in the Powerplay.The introduction of GT's best pacer, Prasidh Krishna and left-arm spinner R Sai Kishore did little to stem the scoring rate. Marsh got into the act, hitting the left-arm spinner for two maximums and smashing the pacer over square leg for six. Markram's one such attempted lofted shot off Sai Kishore, however, saw him lose his wicket, caught at long off by M Shahrukh Khan.Subsequently, leggie Rashid Khan was smashed for 25 in an over as Marsh deposited the short balls on offer to the leg-side boundary. Siraj engaged in a verbal duel with Pooran but ended up leaking 20 off the 16th over. Marsh reached his first IPL century with a single to point in the 17th over. Even the off-colour Rishabh Pant (16 off 6b; 2x6) chipped in with a useful contribution.","Mitchell Marsh and Aiden Markram top score for Lucknow Super Giants with 117. Nicholas Pooran makes 56 as LSG reach 235/2 in 20 overs. Gujarat Titans fall short by 33 runs, folding for 202/9.
