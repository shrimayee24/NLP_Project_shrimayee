You know, you need your space to just get away from it.

Is the NFL Playing Favorites?



What’s Next?



The Los Angeles Rams are preparing for a do-or-die Wild Card match against the Minnesota Vikings, but not everyone is ready for it. Kelly Stafford , wife of the Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford , recently took the NFL to task over what she considers an ""unfair"" and ""annoying"" schedule. Her incendiary remarks have sparked debate among fans regarding whether the league is stacking the deck against the Rams.During her latest edition of The Morning After, Kelly didn't mince words about how frustrated she feels.Her frank comments are part of her own history of publicly calling out Monday Night Football , to which she once referred as ""the worst"".Kelly's complaint is not only about waiting time, but about being at a competitive disadvantage. Being forced to play the last game of the Wild Card round puts the Rams at a disadvantage in recovery time going into the Divisional Round, if they advance.Adding to the chaos, Kelly reported that the household has been dealing with the flu, which made Matthew's preparation for the playoffs even more difficult.Kelly further added.Kelly’s comments raise a larger question: Is the NFL’s scheduling designed to disadvantage certain teams? The Rams, who are already facing a tough matchup against Vikings quarterback Sam Darnold, now have less recovery time if they progress. Conspiracy theories are swirling, with some fans speculating that big-market teams like the Rams are being set up to fail.Whether Kelly's words ring true or not, one thing is clear: the stakes have never been higher. The Rams are getting ready to take on the Vikings in the bright lights of Monday Night Football, and fans are left wondering whether the schedule will be another obstacle or a rallying cry for the team.Also read - Aaron Rodgers’ Ex Mallory Edens’ Cryptic Post Sparks Speculation: Was It a Subtle Dig at Him?

He wants to go back to the Jets in the following year, for which he is not demanding a salary hike. After the Week 18 win, Adams told reporters he's ""potentially"" willing to return without Rodgers but also hasn't committed to his own NFL future.

""I didn't have the energy and the force I'd normally play with,"" Fisher said in the podcast adding that the lack of preparation led Lakers coach Phil Jackson to make a key decision.

Skip Bayless believes Patrick Mahomes had a lousy season

EXACTLY WHY MAHOMES DID NOT DESERVE TO MAKE THE PRO BOWL.

The 2024-25 Chiefs, who have played better this season, have not scored 30 points in a game, making them one of three franchises that have not reached that mark. However, their record is much better than the other two teams. The New York Giants (3-13) had not gotten to 30 points before Week 17, and while Kansas City's incredible winning ability is part of the Mahomes and Reid culture, Skip Bayless believes their success this season is not their prime factor.In his episode of the YouTube show, The Skip Bayless Show, Skip Bayless condemned the Kansas City Chiefs for being ""apparently prideless"" after their loss to the Denver Broncos, as they avoided winning to prevent their biggest playoff rivals from reaching the playoffs. “The apparently priceless Chiefs lost 38 to nothing at Denver.”He continued, “Why do I believe Andy Reid made sure his team had no chance of pulling off any kind of shocking underdog upset? Because no way did the Chiefs want to be responsible for opening the backdoor of the playoffs to Joe Burrow and the Bengals. Patrick Mahomes and Andy Reid and the Chiefs are scared to death of Joe Burrow.”Bayless has previously suggested Kansas City acted nefariously, with many Twitter users expressing concern over Burrow during the Broncos' blowout victory. Chiefs fans noted Reid and Co. resting players before the game became the Bengals' playoff lifeline.The NFL released the 2025 Pro Bowl rosters, which include some notable snubs on the AFC side, including Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, while many players made the cut, including Washington Commanders quarterback Jayden Daniels. Skip Bayless believed Mahomes was replaced by Lamar Jackson, Josh Allen, and Joe Burrow as the right choice for the exhibition event because he hasn't been invited since his rookie season in 2017.Bayless said, “I’ve been saying this for a month now… by his standards, Patrick Mahomes had a lousy regular season. His second straight lousy regular season. No way, this time, did Patrick Mahomes belong on the Pro Bowl team. No way this time did he have a better regular season than Josh Allen, or Lamar Jackson, or Joe Burrow.”Also Read: ""To hell with franchise QB"": Cam Newton has urged managers to terminate their QB including Patrick Mahomes and Josh Allen if their performance is not satisfactory Mahomes has completed 3,928 yards and 26 touchdown passes this season, career-lows.

Sydney Cricket Ground is love at first sight: SCG museum, walk of fame and all the facilities

CHENNAI: The defeat in Australia is still sinking in, but there's not much time left to sulk over it. In a week's time, the provisional squad for the Champions Trophy (CT) will be announced and all eyes will be on Jasprit Bumrah 's availability.The spearhead of the Indian attack suffered from back spasms during the Test match in Sydney, which meant he couldn't bowl in the second innings, leading to an easy victory for Australia. Now, India play their first CT match on February 20 in Dubai, which means he has six weeks to get fit.People who have suffered from similar injuries and doctors treating them believe that ""if it is a back spasm as the team management said"", Bumrah should be fit for CT.But if it is a Grade 1 stress fracture, as suggested by some reports in social media, Bumrah could be out for some time.""It does depend on the final diagnosis of the injury. Back spasm is normally an orange light, it tells you that something worse could be in store and you need to stop at that point… Having suffered a lower back stress fracture earlier, Bumrah must have read the signs at the right time and decided to stop in Sydney,"" a former India Test bowler who had to deal with a similar injury which curtailed his international career, told TOI.According to him, if it's not a stress fracture, the fourth week of January could be the right time to resume training, which should mean Bumrah would be available for CT.Former India trainer Ramji Srinivasan, who has dealt with players suffering such injuries, isn't so sure about the nature of the injury. ""I agree that if it is only spasms, he should be fit. In fact, he might be feeling alright even before he boarded the flight back home. But I am not so sure about it. The injury is related to stress, which is a direct result of playing too much cricket. If it is anything between a Grade 1 to Grade 3 injury related to stress fracture, it can take up to one to six months of recovery,"" Ramji told TOI.Over the years, pace bowlers like Dennis Lillee, Waqar Younis, Shane Bond, Lakshmipathy Balaji, Varun Aaron and Pat Cummins suffered from injuries that Bumrah had to deal with in 2022-23. Coming back from those injuries, bowlers tend to read the signs better. Bumrah, now 31, knew that a series was on the line in Sydney, still he listened to his body and stopped.""That comes from maturity. It must have been a tremendous mental battle to stop himself from bowling in that second innings in SCG. But those are the difficult decisions that a pace bowler, who has dealt with difficult injuries before, has to take,"" the former India pacer said.He added that there is a strong possibility that the injury hasn't recurred at the same spot where it happened before, because following surgery that area normally gets mended. ""Most likely, this time he felt a tightness in the upper back. The reports have gone to his surgeon, we should have the final results very soon. My hunch is he will be part of the first squad that will be announced for CT. After all, you can have an injury replacement later,"" the pacer said.Ramji, though, is slightly wary of a decision like that. ""Bumrah is a treasure and he should be handled with care. A CT is not the end of the world. If there is the slightest doubt, he shouldn't be in the squad. Five back-to-back Test matches isn't something he has ever played in his cricketing career,"" the top trainer said.In fact, it's not just CT. The IPL will follow soon, where the burden of Mumbai Indians' bowling attack will be on Bumrah's shoulders. ""If it's not a fracture there's no problem in Bumrah playing IPL too. But what's important is he gets a two-week break during the tournament. It shouldn't be 14 games on the bounce,"" the paceman said.","Jasprit Bumrah could be out for up to six months with back spasms. If injury is muscular, he could be fit in time for Champions Trophy. India play their first CT match on February 20 in Dubai, which means he has six weeks to get fit.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117038838,imgsize-35554,width-400,resizemode-4/117038838.jpg"

Nineteen-year-old Australian cricketer Sam Konstas addressed his on-field exchange with Indian captain Jasprit Bumrah during the fifth Test, downplaying the incident.Konstas explained that the situation arose from Bumrah's frustration with Usman Khawaja 's perceived delay in taking guard. The umpires intervened in the confrontation. Bumrah eventually dismissed Khawaja and gave Konstas a send-off.“Oh, I didn't get too fazed. Unfortunately, Uzi got out. He was trying to buy some time a little bit. It was probably my fault, but it happens. It's cricket,” Konstas told Triple M Cricket.Konstas praised Bumrah's performance despite the on-field tension and acknowledged the team's strong overall showing.“Credit to Bumrah. He got the wicket, but obviously, great performance from the team.”Konstas reflected on his own approach to the game and its impact on opponents, emphasising his focus on performing to the best of his ability.“Don't know. Whatever's on the field, I just try to do my best and, yeah, I guess I got a few nerves on the other team.”India's series loss prevented them from reaching the World Test Championship final, with Australia securing their spot against South Africa.Konstas discussed his Test debut , stating he felt calm despite the pressure. He mentioned conversations with family and teammates to help manage his composure.“No, I was very calm. I was talking to my parents and all my teammates.”He also recalled Khawaja's observation about his apparent excitement while batting, a feeling Konstas didn't personally register. He expressed satisfaction with his debut and the team's victories.“But obviously, it was a packed stadium, and Uzi (Khawaja) said my adrenaline was pumped when I was batting, but I didn't feel that. Still, it was a good debut, and I'm glad to get two wins.”Konstas's performance against India has raised expectations for his inclusion in the upcoming Sri Lanka tour squad.Konstas addressed the possibility of his selection and adapting to new playing conditions, acknowledging the potential for his game to evolve.“Yeah, I'm not too sure if I'm selected yet. I think we'll find out in the next few days, but obviously adapting to different conditions—maybe we'll find a new Sam.

How Will Tom Brady's Role as Minority Owner Shape the Raiders' Coaching Search?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/how-will-tom-bradys-role-as-minority-owner-shape-the-raiders-coaching-search/articleshow/117038149.cms,"Credit: Getty Images

How Deeply Involved Is Tom Brady in the Raiders' Hunt for a New Coach?



A Glimpse into the Raiders’ Future



Well, the Las Vegas Raiders parted ways with head coach Antonio Pierce just after putting down four wins and thirteen losses in the last place in the AFC West. This season did not go according to expectations; injuries and all-out naps pretty much summed it up. Given that he was probably realizing that a new beginning was needed, Owner Mark Davis took to the hunt for another head coach. Interestingly, co-owner Tom Brady will also play a part in this endeavor as he promised Davis to include him in some major undertaking. This raises an interesting question as to what role and influence exactly Brady will have in the Raiders organization. As time unfolds, the coaching search will unveil how powerful Brady's voice is going to be and how he will influence the future direction of the Silver and Black.The Las Vegas Raiders have confirmed they are in the off-season preparing for a significant overhaul and among the weighty discussions is none other than their minority owner Tom Brady. The franchise is considering a new head coach appointment and possibly new quarterback personnel, which has, in turn, made Brady's role in the affairs of the Raiders a new center of attraction for fans and analysts.Previously, Brady was promised a great involvement in the major decisions, which is being now reflected in the reality. According to a report from Dianna Russini of The Athletic, Brady will hold ""a lot"" of power in the decision-making process regarding the next head coach of the Raiders. Further, it was reported by ESPN's Adam Schefter that Brady's involvement will include being part of a ""collaborative committee"" interviewing candidates for a coaching role. It solidifies even further this shift away from Davis's actions that he trusts Brady's football smarts and knows he could provide a fresh perspective.The Raiders are contemplating adopting their draft strategy to their head coach appointment process as they hold the sixth overall selection in the 2025 NFL Draft. Brady's involvement is likely to go further than just coaching hires since he will also be expected to have a large role in selecting the next quarterback for the franchise. This dual responsibility speaks volumes of the franchise's intent to rebuild via one of the best minds in football.In the earlier instances where Davis had tried to rely on Josh McDaniels, then firing him, or to cause Dave Ziegler to panic along with firing the previous coach, it might be assumed that this is the reason why he is using Brady now: not merely for these reasons of condemnation by Davis of the previous choices. There is an English phrase about the ""Patriot Way"" that still intrigues Davis, but putting Brady into the equation now could provide a new lens as to how the premise might apply. By positioning Brady as a key figure, Davis eases some pressure on himself, especially considering all his previous poor coaching hires.Withdrawing all possible force effects from Brady leaves the most workable possibilities with much noise. After all, just as have-nots in the style of Bill Belichick, it also begets the fact that Tampa has created a culture of secrecy when it comes to decisions from the Raiders. Claimed by many fans and pundits to work with the mysterious operations, so these left them to wonder. As Russini puts it, some insiders think Brady might have a lower than usual profile this winter in terms of how quickly he impacts the immediate environment.Also Read: Tom Brady is being questioned about his dual roles in the team as the Raiders search for a new head coach What is certain, however, is that the offseason moves of the Raiders will pave the way for their future. Be it the emergence of Brady's right kind of candidates or the unexpected direction taken by the franchise-the NFL world will be watching closely. It is now all eyes on Las Vegas as the team prepares to write another chapter of its storied history.","The Las Vegas Raiders parted ways with head coach Antonio Pierce just after putting down four wins and thirteen losses in the last place in the AFC West.

R Ashwin announces retirement from Test cricket

Why R Ashwin retirement was a last minute surprise for Ravindra Jadeja

Off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin shocked the cricketing world with his sudden retirement after the third Test of India's tour of Australia as he decided to quit the international arena with immediate effect, leaving himself available only for club-level cricket.The unexpected nature of the decision left multiple theories floating around, speculating the reason behind Ashwin's departure; and former Australia wicketkeeper Brad Haddin feels there's still more to come out of it.Calling the development a ""funny one"", Haddin believes that Ashwin was unhappy about being benched for the Perth Test and decided enough's enough when he was left out of the playing eleven in Brisbane as well.Haddin also felt India had no proper plan in place, which showed in them opting for three different spinners in the first three Tests of the Border Gavaskar Trophy , which Australia won 3-1 in the end.""The first three Test matches, they played three different spinners. So they arrived not knowing what their game style is going to be around here. It shouldn't be a shock when you get here; they have played here enough, they have had success here. So Ashwin retiring mid-series was a funny one. I don't think we've heard the last of that yet. I think he was just jack of not getting picked,"" Haddin said while talking on an episode of the 'Willow Talk' podcast.India won the first Test in Perth, which remained their only victory of the series. They lost the pink-ball Test in Adelaide, the Boxing Day match in Melbourne and the New Year Test in Sydney.The third Test in Brisbane was hit by rain and ended in a draw.""I think he (Ashwin) sees himself as the number one spinner,"" Haddin continued. ""His record is elite, and he just went, 'You know what, I'm not sitting on the bench. If you can't decide that I'm your best spinner, I'm done. I've played enough. I don't need this'.""Ashwin retired as India's second most successful bowler in Test cricket. His 537 red-ball wickets are only behind leg-spin legend Anil Kumble's 619.Ashwin also featured in 116 ODIs and took 156 wickets. He played 65 T20Is, taking 72 wickets in the shortest format.",Ravichandran Ashwin retired from Test cricket after the third Test of India's tour of Australia.

Gautam Gambhir press conference: On Kohli, Rohit and dressing room

It doesn't read too flattering, TOI's Report Card following India's performance in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy Down Under. Apart from topper Jasprit Bumrah and new boy, Jaiswal, the rest disappointed, were poor in application and betrayed. A lack of depth that led to an embarrassing 3-1 verdict in Australia's favour. Hindol Basu gives out the grades, return it signed at your own risk.If he could have been rated more than 10, Bumrah would deserve it for his superlative, superhuman performance. Pivotal in keeping India competitive in the series, he was the standout performer, a show which earned him the Player of the Series award.On his first tour to Australia, Jaiswal emerged as India's highest run-scorer with 391 runs at an average of 43.44, including a century and two halfcenturies. His aggressive yet calculated knock of 161 in the Perth Test helped India start the series on a victorious note. In Melbourne too, his twin 80s raised India's hopes for a draw, but it wasn't to be.Rahul had a mixed series, reflecting both promise and inconsistency. He scored 276 runs at an average of 30.66, including two half-centuries: 84 in Brisbane and 77 in Perth. His 201-run opening partnership with Jaiswal in Perth was the highlight, but inconsistency plagued him in the subsequent matches.Kohli's form was below par – he managed only 190 runs at an average of 23.75. Despite a century in Perth, his on-field frustrations were evident throughout the series. Kohli's struggles were characterized by a recurring weakness: being dismissed 8 times out of 9 to deliveries outside off stump, leading to easy catches in the slip cordon.Missing the opening Test due to the birth of his child, the Indian captain had the strangest of tours, sitting out of the final Test amid retirement speculation. He struggled, scoring just 31 runs in five innings at an average of 6.20. His form and leadership came under scrutiny. His performance marked the lowest average for any touring captain in a Test series in Australia. As captain too, not only did he lack imagination, Rohit made decisions that lacked clarity.Pant had an inconsistent series. His aggressive batting was both an asset and a liability, with some reckless shots drawing criticism. Pant struggled to convert promising starts into significant scores throughout the series. His 61 off 33 balls in the Sydney Test was a standout knock, but he couldn't convert it into a matchwinning one.In his debut series, Reddy scored 298 runs at an average of 37.25, including a historic century at the MCG. His bowling was less effective, yielding only five wickets. Reddy's success positioned him as a long-term prospect for the Indian Test team. The series also showed his ability to adapt and deliver under pressure.Siraj took 20 wickets, the second highest for India, but was often expensive, averaging over 31. He faced criticism for leaking runs at times, especially his 0-122 in Melbourne which raised alarm. Siraj bowled a total of 157.1 overs, the most by any Indian bowler in the series, over Bumrah's 151.2. Despite his wickets tally, Siraj's performance fluctuated throughout the series.Gill's performance was disappointing, scoring only 93 runs at an average of 18.60. At the No. 3 position, he failed to capitalize on starts. His batting seemed to be confused and lacking in intent.Jadeja's contribution was below expectations, with 135 runs at an average of 27 and only four wickets in three Tests. His overall performance affected the team's balance during the tour. While his batting at times provided lower-order resistance, his lack of wicket-taking ability was notable.Ashwin played only one Test, taking a single wicket before announcing his retirement from international cricket after the third Test in Brisbane. His retirement appeared contentious and sparked discussions about the timing.In three matches, Washington scored 114 runs at an average of 22.80 and took three wickets at an average of 38.66, failing to make a significant impact in either department. While he showcased moments of resilience with the bat, particularly in Melbourne, his overall impact was limited by underutilization as a bowler.Playing in the final Test in Sydney, Krishna impressed with six wickets at an average of 17.83, stepping up in Bumrah's absence and showcasing potential for the future. His performance at the SCG not only demonstrated his potential, but also highlighted lack of clarity in team selection, as what could have been had he been included earlier.Akash Deep's moment under the sun in the BGT came with the bat instead of his bowling. He scored an invaluable 31 in a critical situation during the first innings of the Brisbane Test, the knock helping India avoid a follow-on, and draw the Test. With the ball, he showed promise but failed to get wickets.Rana's BGT sojourn was a tale of two contrasting outings: an impressive debut in Perth followed by a significant drop in form thereafter. His future prospects will depend on how he addresses his inconsistencies and adapts to the pressures of international cricket.Padikkal played just the first Test in Perth. He was dismissed for a duck in the first innings after facing 23 balls, but in the second essay he stitched together a decent partnership with Jaiswal. He showed promise during the 25-run stay at the crease.Jurel showed promise during the ‘A' series before the BGT, which led to him being picked for the Perth Test. But knocks of 11 & 1 didn't help his cause and he wasn't a part of the playing XI in the remaining Tests.Gambhir did his reputation no favour on the tour, his first big test as coach. His team selection, strategies, decisions and dressing room unity all came under intense scrutiny as the team faltered. Critics questioned the effectiveness of the coaching staff, particularly in addressing the team's batting inconsistencies and tactical nous."," TOI's Report Card following India's performance in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy Down Under.

As the match ended, cricket memes went viral on social media platforms. Here are some of the viral memes that just capture the emotion/sadness of Indian Cricket fans.

Record number of spectators

Australia clinched a thrilling 184-run victory over India in a dramatic final session of the fourth Test in Melbourne, taking a 2-1 lead in the five-match series. India, needing 340 to win, collapsed to 155 all out, losing their last seven wickets for just 34 runs in 20.3 overs. India appeared to be heading for a draw after Yashasvi Jaiswal (84) and Rishabh Pant (30) steered them to 112-3 at tea. However, Pant's dismissal, attempting a six off Travis Head, triggered a batting collapse.Controversy arose with Jaiswal's dismissal. Initially given not out to a caught-behind appeal, the TV umpire overturned the decision based on visual evidence of the ball changing direction, despite the absence of audible noise. Jasprit Bumrah was exceptional for India, taking 5-57 in the second innings and nine wickets in the match. He had reduced Australia to 91-6 at one stage, a lead of less than 200.The match set a record attendance for cricket in Australia, with 373,591 spectators. Head described the atmosphere as inspiring and hailed the match as one of the best he has been involved in. India now needs to win the final Test in Sydney to level the series and retain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy .","Australia beat India by 184 runs in the fourth Test in Melbourne.

Poll Do You Agree With Graeme Smith's Concern About a Two-Tier System in Test Cricket? Top Teams Will Raise Standards All Teams Need Equal Support

The debate around the idea of a two-tier system for Tests is one of most discussed topics in world cricket at the moment, with former players voicing themselves out with strong views. In that line, ex-South Africa captain Graeme Smith has expressed his disapproval of the idea, saying that it leaves teams other than the ""top three nations"" -- India, Australia and England -- struggling.""My answer to that would be we ( South Africa ) are in the World Test Championship (WTC) final; we've got a chance to win the mace. I think that's the key,"" Smith said while talking to Sky Sports, answering how the move, if it happens, will affect South African cricket.The Proteas have topped the WTC table for 2023-25 to qualify for the WTC final against Australia in June this year at Lord's.""You've got to do what you've got to do, and South Africa have done that. I think over the last couple of years, their win percentages are actually pretty decent if you go and look over a period of time,"" said Smith.Smith said it doesn't happen in any sport where the top three nations are seen facing off ""all the time"" and that there needs to be a balance that allows other nations to play the big teams.The two-tier system for Test cricket will separate the top teams from the rest, which will see the smaller teams playing each other in the lower division.""I also do feel for the ICC . I was just looking at a note this morning at how much England and India are playing each other over the next period, and Australia and vice versa. It gets extremely hard for the other nations...,"" Smith added.""India are probably the best because they are commercially so reliable for the other nations. But where do you find the top three nations playing each other all the time? And you can only imagine in the next FTP cycle how that's been tied up in the background.""He said for the betterment of the sport, teams like South Africa, West Indies and Sri Lanka need to be backed to keep raising their level of cricket.""How does the ICC create a structure that's fair in the top three's eyes? I think what world cricket needs is, it needs South Africa strong, needs the West Indies strong, needs Sri Lanka to get better.""Otherwise, can you see a world where there are only three nations playing cricket in the future?"" he asked to conclude.","Ex-South Africa captain Graeme Smith has expressed his disapproval of the idea of a two-tier system for Test cricket.

NEW DELHI: Australian tennis player Nick Kyrgios, known for his polarizing personality, has withdrawn from an exhibition match against Novak Djokovic due to an abdominal strain.This development raises concerns about his fitness for the upcoming Australian Open , which commences this weekend.Kyrgios made his return to tennis last week in Brisbane after an 18-month hiatus, during which he underwent knee surgery and wrist reconstruction.However, his comeback was short-lived as he exited in the first round after a gruelling three-set encounter with the rising French star Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard.

MUMBAI: Former India skipper Dilip Vengsarkar has criticised the seamer-friendly pitch at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) for the final Test of BGT, which saw Australia beat India by six wickets inside three days.Vengsarkar wants ICC, which conducts the World Test Championship , to take charge of Test match pitches, just like it does in its global white-ball tournaments, to ensure “good quality Test cricket” for the numerous fans who still throng to watch Test matches, as was evident in Australia.“The quality of the pitch at Sydney was substandard. Just like some of the (turning) wickets that we offer for Tests in India are substandard. I think that the time has come, if you want to see good quality cricket, you need to ensure good pitches at the highest level. It’s time ICC monitors the preparation of Test match wickets. They should fly down their pitch experts/curators for every Test staging centre at least 10 days before a Test. This is essential so that people get their money’s worth, and the game, particularly Test cricket, becomes popular,” Vengsarkar told TOI.“If you don’t do this, every country will prepare poorquality pitches to ensure maximum points for the WTC. The whole purpose of conducting the WTC is defeated,” the former India chief selector stated.While Australia’s Steve Smith said that he hadn’t batted on a Sydney pitch with so much grass in his life, Sunil Gavaskar was heavily critical of the pitch.“The Sydney pitch was heavily loaded in favour of pacers. It’s tough to bat on these kinds of strips. It’s easy to criticise the batsmen for not scoring runs, but the fact is the pitch was substandard. There was so much grass on the pitch that the cows could’ve grazed on it! Unfortunately for us, (Jasprit) Bumrah got injured, otherwise Australia wouldn’t have been able to chase 162. But my point is, ‘Who wants to see teams get out or 150 or 180?’ People come to watch good cricket,” Vengsarkar said.",Former India skipper Dilip Vengsarkar has criticised the seamer-friendly pitch at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) for the final Test of BGT.

In January 2025, at the very same time, five T20 leagues will be played across the globe. Australia's Big Bash, New Zealand's Super Smash and Bangladesh Premier League, already underway, will continue into the new year. UAE's ILT20 and South Africa's SA20 will kick-start in the first fortnight.It presents a challenge not just for the league organisers but also the players. Where should they play? What is the motivation - the intensity of the competition? How about the stature of a league itself? Or, the vibe of the team? How much does the location matter? Is it the hefty salaries that go with it? For some, all of them do. Many players, unfairly labelled as T20 'mercenaries', would even zip across the globe to play for different teams in different leagues.Every T20 league tries to position itself as the best, the most competitive and lure the best players in the world. Also in that race is SA20 which will get its third season underway from 9 January.What makes SA20 special and a catch? ""First of all, just travelling to South Africa, for people from other places around the world is a joy. I think it's a great country to travel to. There's a wonderful diversity in the landscape. You've got the mountains, the bush belt, the game viewing, you go to the coasts and you have sunny beaches. There's fantastic restaurants, great hospitality, great accommodation,"" explained SA20 Ambassador AB de Villiers in a group interaction ahead of the season.""It's already just a nice tour for any player to come from a cricketing perspective. I think the crowds are different to anywhere else in the world, the grounds are built differently. There's a lot of grass embankments at Boland Park, Centurion, at Newlands, St George's Park, Durban's Kingsmead. You don't see that very often around the world. There's a wonderful atmosphere because of that. Over the weekends, you'll see barbecues happening outside the stadium and just a fantastic atmosphere leading to the game. The crowd, attendance, not so much in numbers, but the atmosphere they create, the sing alongs. They bring a different atmosphere to anywhere else in the world,"" he added.Most of the players who will be part of the SA20 Season 3 have made their way to respective venues in South Africa. The practices are underway, team bonding activities have begun after the New Year's festivities with the families. Sunrisers Eastern Cape come in as the two-time defending champions, winning both of the first two editions.AB de Villiers, nicknamed Mr. 360, is stoked to see a bigger tournament than before with plenty of international firepower. Unlike the previous season, there is no clash with the international team's commitments and many of England's top players have made the journey.He argued that it is the growing availability of foreign talent that suggests which way the tournament is headed. He used IPL's example to illustrate the point.""I think we can just keep growing with regards to the overseas players. I think that's a large part of the success of the IPL over the years. Every year since 2008, the overseas contingents seem to get stronger and stronger. You get the best players in the world and best players in India and that combination makes for great cricket. So I think for Graeme (Smith, the SA20 Commissioner) and his team, moving forward is just to keep pushing hard, get the best quality players over here.""""I think the group of overseas players that are joining this season is stronger than seasons one and two, so it's tracking in the right direction. And then I would love to see more Indian players involved. We know Dinesh Karthik will be involved this year, which is fantastic, and it's great for the tournament. Hopefully the BCCI (Board of Control for Cricket in India) will allow us to get more Indian players in the future to come and join in the fun of SA20,"" said ABD.When put on the spot and asked to name the Indians he would love to bring in, he was quick to include Jasprit Bumrah, Rishabh Pant, his ex-Royal Challengers Bengaluru colleague Virat Kohli, Shubman Gill, Suryakumar Yadav. However, BCCI's rules bar current India players from playing in overseas leagues. Once they retire, though, players can do as they please - as is the case for Karthik who will play for Paarl Royals. AB de Villier's snap list of retired players for SA20 included Robin Uthappa, Karthik, Zaheer Khan, Irfan Pathan and Yuzvendra Chahal, who, he joked, ""would have no choice.""For now, SA20 gets underway with some of the top talents in the world on Thursday with Sunrisers Eastern Cape taking on MI Cape Town.","SA20 will get its third season underway from 9 January. Sunrisers Eastern Cape come in as the two-time defending champions. Unlike the previous season, there is no clash with the international team's commitments.

NEW DELHI: Team India witnessed a rollercoaster Test season which came to an end with a 1-3 defeat in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy . The loss also marked the end of India's decade-long dominance in the series, as Australia reclaimed the coveted trophy after 10 years.India began their Test season with authority against Bangladesh at MA Chidambaram Stadium. The first Test saw India register a massive 280-run victory, thanks to a collective batting effort and the spin duo of Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja dismantling Bangladesh's lineup.The caravan moved to Kanpur, where India completed the sweep in a match that will be remembered for the ages. Despite only 35 overs being bowled across the first three days, the hosts pulled off an incredible heist.But their push for an unthinkable victory reflected Team India's unwavering mindset - a determination to strive for success regardless of the situation.India facing only 312 balls in this match marked the second-fewest deliveries they have faced — and the fourth-fewest overall - to secure a Test victory, trailing only their 281-ball chase against South Africa in Cape Town last year.New Zealand were up against India in their next assignment at home for a three-match series. Going by India's current form and New Zealand's past record on Indian soil, the series was expected to be a straightforward challenge for the hosts.However, India were dealt a stunning blow in the first innings of the opening Test in Bengaluru, collapsing to a mere 46 runs - their lowest-ever Test total at home.New Zealand capitalised with a strong batting performance, securing a substantial lead and ultimately chasing down the target with ease. The victory marked New Zealand's first Test win in India since 1988.What unfolded in the next Test at Pune was something India hadn't experienced in over a decade, as New Zealand handed them their first home Test series defeat since 2012.New Zealand's spinners, particularly Mitchell Santner, played a pivotal role, with Santner taking 13 wickets in the match. India's batting lineup struggled to counter the spin threat, leading to a significant defeat.The third and last Test of the series at Wankhede Stadium in Bengaluru brought no change of fortunes for the hosts as New Zealand did the unthinkable and inflicted a first 3-0 whitewash on India at home with 25-run victory.The focus then shifted to one of the biggest rivalries in world cricket - the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. India, who reigned supreme on the previous two tours Down Under, were once again tipped to hand a shocker to Australia in their own backyard.And India rightly lived up to the expectations as they secured a commanding victory in the first Test at Perth, winning by 295 runs.However, Australia bounced back in the second Test (day-night) in Adelaide, achieving a 10-wicket win. The third Test in Brisbane concluded in a draw, setting the stage for a competitive remainder of the series.However, the cricketing world was met with surprise after the completion of Gabba Test as star Indian spinner Ravichandran Ashwin announced his retirement from all forms of international cricket with immediate effect.In the fourth Test at Melbourne, Australia clinched a 184-run victory to go 2-1 up in the five-match series, leaving a lot to ponder ahead of the New Year Test in Sydney.On the eve of the Sydney Test, Indian cricket fans were taken aback when the out-of-form skipper, Rohit Sharma, opted to 'stood out' from the match to make way for Shubman Gill. However, the move yielded little success, as Australia maintained their momentum and won the fifth Test by six wickets, ultimately securing the series.",India's Test season came to an end with a 1-3 defeat in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.

NEW DELHI: Young opener Shafali Verma considers leading India to victory in the inaugural U19 Women's World Cup as a significant milestone in her cricket journey.In January 2023, Verma's exceptional leadership and batting prowess, amassing 172 runs throughout the tournament, steered India to triumph over England with a seven-wicket margin in the final match in South Africa.""Representing India in itself is a great honour. Being chosen to captain the Indian cricket team was icing on the cake, honestly. I was fortunate to have some of the finest talent in the age-group cricket from back home at my disposal,"" the ICC quoted Verma as saying in a release.""While it was simply brilliant to lead that talented lot, it was more about playing together as a unit, sharing a solid camaraderie and making sure everyone is in great spirits as we looked to enjoy ourselves in the middle.""Obviously, winning the tournament – the first of its kind in women's age-group cricket – as a captain will remain one of the best moments of my cricketing career; something that I will remember forever. It is safe to say that I was pretty emotional as we were about to lift that trophy and started to celebrate a special triumph,"" she added.The second ICC U19 Women's T20 World Cup is scheduled in Malaysia from January 18 to February 2, with 16 nations participating.The inaugural tournament introduced several talented Indian players to international cricket, notably leg-spinner Parshavi Chopra with 11 wickets and batter Shweta Sehrawat , who topped the run charts with 297 runs.Verma emphasises that this competition provides an excellent platform for young cricketers to demonstrate their abilities and compete against international talent.""It is a massive help to play in a tournament like this. It is a big opportunity to showcase your talent on the world stage. It has all the potential to fast track some of the young and promising cricketers to represent their respective countries with the senior teams,"" said the 20-year-old.The tournament's third edition is confirmed for Bangladesh and Nepal in 2027, which Verma considers essential for women's cricket development.""It is extremely crucial to have a U19 Women's tournament in a structure that only had senior women's tournaments before this,"" she said.""It is a win-win for the age-group teams as well as the senior sides where you have a larger pool of players available for selection.""There is healthy competition and that always is a welcome sign. The U19 Women's tournament structure is a need of the hour as it also acts as a crucial segway to move into the senior sides. So, it is not only massive for the age-group cricket but also for the overall growth of the game.""With Nepal, Nigeria, Samoa, Scotland and United States qualifying through regional competitions, Verma encourages the upcoming players to maximise this opportunity.""My best wishes are with them. Having played the tournament in its first-ever edition, I can vouch for the fact that it will be a fantastic experience for the players who are going to take part in the second edition of this tournament,"" Verma said.""The message for me for everyone who is going to be a part in this year's tournament is very simple: enjoy this experience and make the most of it. This could just be a start for something bigger but live in the moment and enjoy the process.""",Shafali Verma captained India to victory in the inaugural U19 Women's World Cup.

Newcastle United took a big step towards the League Cup final with a 2-0 away win at Arsenal on Tuesday in the first leg of their semifinal.Alexander Isak and Anthony Gordon scored to secure the win for Newcastle, who have never won this competition, leaving Arsenal with a significant challenge in the return leg on February 5.The winners of this semifinal will face either Tottenham Hotspur or Liverpool for the title.Isak, currently England's most prolific striker, scored the opening goal and assisted Gordon for the second. In contrast, the absence of a clinical finisher hurt Arsenal despite the return of Kai Havertz, Martin Odegaard and Gabriel Martinelli to their starting lineupBoth the managers, Mikel Arteta and Eddie Howe, demonstrated their commitment to the competition by fielding their strongest available sides.Despite dominating possession and creating numerous opportunities, Arsenal struggled to convert their chances effectively. The closest Arsenal came was through Martinelli, who struck the woodwork after latching onto Leandro Trossard's delivery.Shortly afterwards, Arsenal, typically strong at set-pieces themselves, conceded when a long free-kick into their area found Isak, who finished decisively with a shot that went in via the crossbar.The Swede's 14th strike in his last 15 appearances elevated him to 50 goals for Newcastle, achieving this milestone quicker than club legend Alan Shearer.Isak played a crucial part in what could prove to be a match-defining second goal shortly after half-time. The Newcastle forward's skilful footwork enabled him to unleash a shot, which David Raya could only deflect towards Gordon, who promptly converted the rebound.Arsenal had opportunities to improve their prospects for the return fixture at Tyneside next month.

Arne Slot on Tuesday emphasised that ongoing contract discussions involving key Liverpool players are not affecting team performance, following harsh critiques of Trent Alexander-Arnold 's showing against Manchester United Alexander-Arnold, who has been associated with a potential Real Madrid transfer, was responsible for Lisandro Martinez's goal in the 2-2 draw at Anfield on Sunday, during what was a below-par performance.The discussion about the right-back's future with the Premier League frontrunners continues as his contract situation remains unresolved.At 26, he is now eligible to negotiate with foreign clubs for a pre-contract agreement, as his current deal concludes this season.Reports indicate Real Madrid made an offer for the Liverpool academy graduate, which the club reportedly declined.Other significant players, including captain Virgil van Dijk and leading goalscorer Mohamed Salah , also have contracts expiring at season's end.Speaking ahead of Wednesday's League Cup semi-final first leg against Tottenham, Slot acknowledged Alexander-Arnold's performance against United was not up to his usual standard.""He's played so, so, so many games well for this club,"" he said. ""Now it wasn't his best, like for some others, it wasn't the best game.""And we just pick it up, start training today again, because these players know if you play 50, 60 games in the season that once in a while you don't have your best performance.""The Liverpool manager expressed dissatisfaction with how his players' performances are evaluated.""If we drop points, if Mo (Salah) misses the penalty against Madrid, he's distracted by his contract situation,"" said Slot.""If Trent has not his best performance, he's distracted by the contract situation.""If they play really well, nobody tells me, 'Yeah, that's because they have a contract situation'.""We always try to find arguments, but nine out of ten times the best argument is the quality of the teams you face, or the game plan the other team has.""Regarding Salah's enigmatic social media post on Monday featuring the three players with expiring contracts, Slot maintains direct communication with his squad.""I talk to my players so if there is anything that worries them, then they share this with me. That has not happened until now,"" he said.He concluded: ""I'm not focused on social media posts or what has been said about us, because if you do that as a Liverpool manager, you have no life, because this is one of the biggest clubs in the world and every second of the day people talk about us.""",Trent Alexander-Arnold has been linked with a move to Real Madrid.

This situation affects Olmo, who played a vital role in Spain's Euro 2024 triumph and is crucial to Barcelona's trophy aspirations.The club is appealing to Spain's top sports court (CSD), whilst club president Joan Laporta faces criticism from opposition factions over the situation.The initial registration of Olmo and Victor occurred temporarily following Andreas Christensen's injury.After losing two court cases, Barcelona sold VIP boxes at their under-construction Spotify Camp Nou for approximately 100 million euros ($104 million) to meet La Liga's financial fair play requirements, but missed the submission deadline by three days.Despite Barcelona now meeting financial criteria, La Liga regulations prevent players from re-registering with the same club within one season. Barcelona intends to challenge this rule's relevance.Reports indicate both players are displeased, having received assurances about their registration status. Coach Hansi Flick expressed dissatisfaction, while Ronald Araujo acknowledged the situation's negative impact.Olmo, who transferred from RB Leipzig, reportedly has a release clause allowing a free departure. However, neither player seeks permanent departure, potentially leading to a season-long absence if Barcelona's appeal fails.The situation mirrors the 2015 case of Arda Turan and Aleix Vidal, who couldn't play for six months due to Barcelona's registration ban. Under current circumstances, neither Olmo nor Victor could secure loans without complex contractual arrangements.Laporta faces mounting pressure, with opposition groups demanding his resignation. His presidency, set until 2026, faces scrutiny from ten groups, including Victor Font's faction.This crisis adds to Laporta's controversial tenure, which began in March 2021 amidst financial difficulties and includes the departure of Lionel Messi and criticism over the club's financial decisions.","Barcelona's inability to comply with La Liga's financial regulations has left both Olmo and Pau Victor ineligible for the remainder of the season.

Poor defending kills East Bengal’s comeback hopes as Mumbai seal it 3-2,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/indian-super-league/top-stories/poor-defending-kills-east-bengals-comeback-hopes-as-mumbai-seal-it-3-2/articleshow/117011517.cms,"Image credit: ISL

KOLKATA: In the end, East Bengal FC ’s promise for another gripping fightback at the Salt Lake Stadium vanished with a piece of dreadful defending.Riding their usually impressive wing-play, Mumbai City FC left the home team all over the place on Monday and went into the break with a handsome 2-0 lead thanks to goals from Lallianzuala Chhangte (39) and Nikolaos Karelis (44). East Bengal’s defensive set-up was at fault on both occasions.However, Oscar Bruzon’s hosts came back in the second half with renewed resolve and an own goal by Sahil Panwar (66) and substitute David Hmar’s deft left-footed finish in the 82nd minute not only turned the game on its head at 2-2 but kept East Bengal on track of producing a captivating comeback. Bruzon’s players had been there and done that here three weeks ago. But unlike the way they stunned Punjab FC 4-2 after trailing 0-2 at the end of the first half, Bruzon’s side imploded themselves in a terrible manner this time around.As Nathan Rodrigues delivered an ambitious through ball, it escaped Anwar Ali’s stretched leg near the halfline. Yet, Hijazi Maher was there to deal with the threat, but East Bengal’s Jordanian defender made a mess of his interception, allowing Karelis to do the simple job of beating goalkeeper Prabhsukhan Gill from close and establishing their domination on the red-and-gold in the ISL .The win helped Petr Kratky’s Mumbai move up to fifth on the standings with 23 points from 14 matches, while East Bengal’s hopes for getting closer to playoffs suffered another jolt, lying 11th with 14 points.After ending the year with one of their worst defeats (0-3 at NorthEast United FC ), Kratky was looking for a response from his players, and Vikram Pratap Singh and Bipin Singh rose to the occasion in no time, tormenting the home team with some pacey and eye-catching moves down the wings. It was, however, Kratky’s use of Chhangte as the centre of his domestic attacking trident which came in handy.Bruzon’s move to adopt a high line also proved to be a failed ploy in negotiating Mumbai’s attacks. In the first instance, East Bengal defenders were found wanting in noticing Chhangte’s run from behind as Mumbai winger latched on to Brandon Fernandes’ pass and placed it past a hapless Gill.Another sloppy defending allowed Mumbai to go 2-0 up. This time, Yuste was unable to stop Karelis’ run and Gill didn’t come out of his line to close the gap with Mumbai’s No. 9. The East Bengal defender managed to block Karelis’ first shot but the Greek striker slotted the rebound in.Bruzon had to react and on came Nishu Kumar and Mahesh Naorem Singh in the second half.The hosts upped their ante and Mahesh came calling with his trademark run down the flank. His initial shot was blocked by Mumbai goalkeeper Rehenesh TP but Vishnu followed the rebound and cut it back from the other end. Panwar, trying to clear the ball, ended up pushing it in.East Bengal looked hungry for more, virtually throwing the kitchen sink. David, replacing Jeakson Singh, made it 2-2 with a brilliant finish.East Bengal fans were suddenly sensing another comeback in the making. But Maher’s atrocious defending eventually put such hopes to bed.",Mumbai City FC went into the break with a handsome 2-0 lead thanks to goals from Lallianzuala Chhangte (39) and Nikolaos Karelis (44) East Bengal’s defensive set-up was at fault on both occasions.

Star midfielder Luka Modric scored as Spanish giants Real Madrid thrashed Deportivo Minera 5-0 to storm their way to the pre-quarterfinals of the Copa del Rey on Monday.Spain 's 'five star' show came via goals from Federico Valverde, Eduardo Camavinga and Arda Guler in the first half. The fourth strikes came in the second half from Modric before Guler completed his brace to seal the scoreline.Madrid introduced strikers Kylian Mbappe and Vinicius Junior only in the second half, as manager Carlo Ancelotti rested them in view of the Spanish Super Cup commencing in Saudi Arabia later this week.The match's early momentum was established when Valverde struck a volley at the far post, followed by Camavinga's header after 13 minutes to extend the advantage.Endrick nearly secured a third goal for Los Blancos, followed by Guler's successful strike, which deflected in after he moved inwards from the right wing.Early in the second period, Brahim Diaz struck the woodwork before veteran Modric, aged 39, scored with an elegant curling shot.In the final moments, Guler converted smoothly after receiving a setup from Fran Garcia, completing an impressive performance by the Turkish midfielder.Barcelona and Atletico Madrid progressed to the subsequent round on Saturday, whilst Athletic Bilbao, the current champions, narrowly advanced via penalties against third-tier Logrones.","Real Madrid thrash Deportivo Minera 5-0 in Copa del Rey.

Premier Tour will ensure a large ecosystem for tennis: Craig Tiley,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/premier-tour-will-ensure-a-large-ecosystem-for-tennis-craig-tiley/articleshow/117038789.cms,"Craig Tiley (Image credit: Tennis Australia)

Excerpts:

Players want shorter seasons, play with the same ball through the year, faster/slower courts, is tennis in danger of being homogenized?

Would a Premier Tour then divide the sport?

Jannik Sinner and Iga Swiatek have failed drug tests in 2024, how would that affect the Aus Open?

Novak Djokovic is chasing a 25th major title at the Australian Open, what do you think has worked for him in Melbourne?

The Murray-Djokovic partnership?

Craig Tiley – CEO, Tennis Australia and Tournament Director, Australian Open – believes a Premier Tour would give the multi-tiered sport order and breathing space.The idea of a Premier Tour – based on a breakaway formula, that appears to cater to elite players - has been the talking point in tennis for the last couple of years.In an exclusive chat with TOI, ahead of the first Grand Slam of the year, Tiley also warned not to underestimate the 10-time champion 37-year-old Novak Djokovic The Grand Slams are of the view that having fans understand when a player starts their journey and where they go and ensuring there’s a really good off-season for the players, is important. The seven governing bodies in tennis (ITF, ATP, WTA and the four Grand Slam tournaments) are in ongoing conversations, how do you create a Premium Tour that consists of major events throughout the year. Many of them already exist, but how do you bind them together? Elevate the premium side with the Grand Slams and Masters events potentially, that creates a strong narrative. For example, from Jan to Oct, and then having a couple of months off for off-season. The challenge we have in tennis is that it’s hard for the fans to understand why a player is playing here, what it means to their worldranking or their race. It’s not as clear-cut as we would like it to be. There’s an opportunity for the sport to be more coordinated in the delivery of that product to the fans. It also depends on the number of players you’re going to count in the professional ecosystem, having a thousand (players) potentially could be too many, so that has to be looked at.It’s really important that you have a large ecosystem. It comes down to a few things and one of them is that players need to make more money, and more players need to make a bigger living. We’ve got to create an ecosystem that is commercially viable and strong.The drug related issues are for those that are involved in it and (those) authorities.I’ve been around him for a long time, have a great deal of respect for him and his journey, coming from a war-torn country. It’s a remarkable story. He’s very comfortable playing in Australia, the surface suits his game, he’s got a big fan base here, probably the biggest outside of his home country. Some athletes just click at some places, Rafa (Nadal) did that at Roland Garros, maybe Roger (Federer) did that in many places and also at Wimbledon. We should never underestimate the amount of preparation that goes into (his campaign) and the details he takes care of. I think if I’m an athlete playing against Novak I would lose before I’ve started, just watching his routine because it’s unbelievable. Wouldn’t be surprised if he gets to 25.A promoter’s dream — two (contemporary) Number Ones, one coaching the other. When I first heard about that, before it was announced, I thought it was fantastic for both of them. Andy loves the game so much he will never leave tennis. And Novak with his success, these guys are mates who played against each other. They’ve had great matches here at the Australian Open and I’m looking forward to seeing where Andy is going to help Novak. It’s going to be followed a lot.","Craig Tiley is CEO, Tennis Australia and Tournament Director, Australian Open.

Cameron Norrie avoided disqualification and apologised after his tossed racket accidentally hit a spectator during an ATP Tour tournament in Auckland on Tuesday.Britain's Norrie, who was born in Auckland, was down match point against Argentina's Facundo Diaz Acosta when he lightly tossed his racket into the air. The racket struck a woman in a court-side box, but she was not injured.The chair umpire issued Norrie a warning, and he subsequently lost the match 2-6, 3-6 in the first round of the tournament. Last year, he had reached the final in Auckland.“I wasn’t meaning to do that but it’s still not ideal to be doing that and I’ve never done something like that,"" Norrie said. (The spectator) ""was laughing and I just said ‘so sorry, I didn’t mean to do that.’ And she said ‘yeah, I’m completely OK.’""That was not a big deal. But as we saw with some other players, you can easily be defaulted if it catches them in the wrong spot or they’re not looking or something.""I was not meaning to do that and it is completely not me to do something like that. I apologized very quickly and I want to apologise in general. I’m not happy with how I behaved.”In related incidents, Novak Djokovic was disqualified from the 2020 US Open for accidentally hitting a linesperson with a ball.At the 2023 French Open, Miyu Kato and Aldila Sutjiadi were also defaulted from the women’s doubles after a ball hit by Kato struck a ball girl.Additionally, Australian player Marc Polmans was defaulted from the final round of qualifying at the Shanghai Masters in 2023 for hitting a ball into the face of the chair umpire.","Cameron Norrie apologises after his tossed racket accidentally hit a spectator during an ATP Tour tournament in Auckland on Tuesday.

Excerpts...

Will Sinner and Swiatek's positive tests take the sheen off the Australian Open?

Nick Kyrgios has had a go at Sinner and Swiatek on social media, even hoping to play Sinner...

Novak Djokovic (Reuters Photo)

Would you say Djokovic has a few more years left in tennis?

What motivates Djokovic?

How do you like Alcaraz's chances at Melbourne Park?

How does on-court coaching help someone as gifted as Carlos Alcaraz?

Who would you pick as the surprise factor?

What are Sinner's chances of defending his title?

With the transition from the Big Three era, how do you envision the future of men's tennis?

What is the future of doubles?

The 22-time Grand Slam doubles and mixed-doubles champion Todd Woodbridge dismissed the effect of Jannik Sinner and Iga Swiatek's positive tests on the Australian Open, starting on Sunday in Melbourne Park.The 53-year-old believes the cases were handled swiftly and will not weigh on the first major of the year. In an interview with select media, Woodbridge liked Carlos Alcaraz's chances while warning that Novak Djokovic is motivated to extend his lead at the top of the game.Definitely not! One of the great positives to come out of those cases is the fact that our sport is dealing with them properly. It means our testing is rigid, we have a 52-week policy that players must abide by. The next part is the process they went through.There was negativity about Simona Halep's process, how long it took, why it took so long and then our processes were fixed. So you've had two of the best players in the world that had an issue, they have both been able to prove what those issues were. And remember, you are innocent until proven guilty.They were able to show cause and effect and the process was fast. It has allowed everybody to get back to normal. That is important because they're not going to be the last. There will be other players that are going to trip over or some that may deliberately cheat. There are going to be issues, but I am pleased with the process.As a former athlete, I would never want to put more pressure on myself, that's probably putting more pressure on his own self to have to perform. If that ( Sinner vs Kyrgios ) were to play out, it would be interesting viewing.Nick has been out of the game for a long time (almost two years), which is going to be a difficult thing for him. I hope he hasn't set his expectations too high because it's going to take time to get back to the level that he was playing at before that.He's certainly one of the favourites for the Australian Open. He comes in as little more of an underdog (this year) because he didn't do the best at Grand Slams in 2024, but he was in the Wimbledon final, he won the Olympics, he is knocking on the door. He's fit and motivated. While you've got the motivation, you don't stop. There's at least another two years in Novak, particularly if he has a strong start to this season in Australia.The thing that motivates him is winning Grand Slam titles, it's about extending his lead. No one is ever going to catch him. What drives an athlete like him is having somebody push him and that was Andy Murray Roger Federer , Rafa (Nadal) they challenged him. Now Alcaraz and Sinner have come along and I think he's got a bit to prove to them, that I'm not willing to give it all up yet. That's his motivating factor right now.This is his best chance yet. He didn't get to Australia after winning his first major (US Open, 2022), was injured. Then last year, he didn't have his coach Juan Carlos Ferrero, and he looked tactically unsure and didn't play his best. This time, he has done a proper pre-season. Alcaraz is so dangerous. He's the most enjoyable player to watch since Federer. He has the flair and finesse of Roger, fitness and movement of Novak and then the Spanish determination that Rafa had. He is probably my pick for the Australian Open based on the time he's had to prep. It will be some feat if he was able to win the Australian Open and then have all four majors at such a young age.As he's getting older he's starting to accumulate his own experiences to know what to do at the right time. One of the joys of watching him is that he has so many options, that's why it's so important for him. I'm hoping it's going to be a long career as he learns how to discipline his play because sometimes he plays a lot of drop shots and it's fancy and he can let an opponent back into a match.As you get older, you get more disciplined, you understand how to get that done. That was what Roger started to do very well when he was at his absolute prime, would just demolish players with the right shots at the right time. Carlos is still really putting all that together, he's still got a lot to improve on.I'm waiting for Mirra Andreeva to step up. She has this incredible allcourt game that's modern. It resembles Martina Hingis at her best, but with that modern power.Very high. He is the best player in the world right now. He's the defending champion, but that for me is going to be the one thing he's going to have to learn to live with. He hasn't defended a Grand Slam title yet in his career, this is his first.Everyone was worried. Will the quality drop? And I seriously didn't think that the younger generation would be able to play well this quickly, but they have. Some of their plays are quite extraordinary.They are stronger, more physically trained through technology and data. All of that has made the next generation better. There's still room for this generation to add nuance to their game, add that feel, soft hands, volleys, playing in different parts of the court.It depends on how much the governing bodies continue to make it important. When you see it as an Olympic sport, it remains something everyone focuses upon. When you look at the Grand Slams, it's important, huge events where they need content on all courts, not just Centre Court. So, I don't see it ever leaving the game. And throw in the team competitions like Billie Jean King Cup, Davis Cup , United Cup, they become crucial. Let's be honest, not every player will end up like a Sinner or an Alcaraz or a Sabalenka.(Tune in to watch the Australian Open 2025 from January 12, 2025, 5:30 AM IST onwards live on Sony Sports Ten 1, 2 & 5 channels)",Todd Woodbridge says Jannik Sinner and Iga Swiatek's positive tests will not have an impact on the Australian Open.
