NEW DELHI: Ayush Mhatre delivered a remarkable 94, nearly overshadowing Romario Shepherd's blistering 14-ball fifty, but Royal Challengers Bengaluru secured a thrilling two-run victory against Chennai Super Kings, strengthening their position for IPL playoffs on Saturday.RCB posted an imposing 213 for five, with significant contributions from Virat Kohli (62, 33 balls), Jacob Bethell (55 off 33) and Shepherd (53 not out of 14, 4x4, 6x6), equalling the second-fastest in IPL history. CSK faced an enormous target.Their response was exceptional, led by 17-year-old Mhatre's 94 (48 balls; 9x4, 5x6), ultimately finishing at 211 for five.Mhatre found excellent support in Ravindra Jadeja (77 not out off 45 balls), establishing a substantial 114-run partnership for the third wicket.The young Mumbai batsman initiated the innings by scoring 26 runs off Bhuvneshwar Kumar during the Power Play, maintaining consistent momentum throughout.This victory elevated RCB to the top position with 16 points from 11 matches.Mhatre demonstrated exceptional batting skills acquired through extensive practice at Mumbai's Oval maidan, effectively challenging RCB's bowling unit, which missed Josh Hazlewood due to injury.The selection of Mhatre as Ruturaj Gaikwad's injury replacement, instead of Gujarat's Urvil Patel and Kerala's Salman Nizar, initially raised questions.However, CSK captain Dhoni and coach Stephen Fleming's confidence in Mhatre, following his performance in selection nets, proved justified through his outstanding display.Jadeja, the experienced CSK player who survived dismissals on 57 and 69, provided valuable support and guidance to his young partner throughout the tense encounter.[Remaining paragraphs continue with original quoted text and match details as provided]","Royal Challengers Bengaluru secured a thrilling two-run victory against Chennai Super Kings.

Rajasthan Royals and Sunrisers Hyderabad have both struggled this season, each stuck on 6 points.However, RR have played 11 matches and have been eliminated (E) from the playoff race, while SRH's hopes hang by a thread, suffering their seventh loss and holding a poor NRR of -1.192.Chennai Super Kings are at the bottom, officially eliminated after managing just 2 wins in 10 matches, with the worst net run rate in the tournament (-1.211).","Gujarat Titans beat Sunrisers Hyderabad by 38 runs in IPL 2025.

WWE Backlash added another title bout to the match card

A huge four-way dance has been set in stone for WWE Backlash, where one champion will defend his title against three top competitors.WWE is moving fast towards its next Premium Live Event, Backlash. The event is set to take place on May 10th at the Enterprise Arena in St. Louis, Missouri. The match card has shaped up to be exciting, and on the latest edition of Friday Night SmackDown, a huge fatal four-way match was made official for the show with a championship at stake.On the May 2nd edition of WWE SmackDown, Damian Priest and LA Knight had an exchange of words, with both laying claim to a shot at the WWE United States Championship . This led to a singles match between the two SmackDown stars, who produced a captivating showdown in the process. The match was so exciting that fans erupted in a 'This is Awesome' chant at the very start of the show.However, the bout ended in disqualification after Solo Sikoa interfered. Although he was stopped by both LA Knight and Damian Priest, the current WWE US Champion, Jacob Fatu, appeared and decimated both competitors. Later in the night, Solo and Jacob were in GM Nick Aldis' office. He informed the duo that Jacob Fatu would defend his US title against Damian Priest and LA Knight at WWE Backlash.Solo Sikoa protested and said that it was Drew McIntyre who won the No. 1 contender match by disqualification last week on SmackDown. Aldis agreed, but threw a major curveball at them. He changed the match to a Fatal 4-way, adding McIntyre to the bout.This will be Jacob Fatu's first title defense. The Samoan Werewolf won the star-spangled prize at WrestleMania 41, dethroning LA Knight, which earned him a huge ovation from the audience at the Allegiant Stadium. However, his first title defense has posed a huge threat to his title reign, which has only begun. With competitors like LA Knight, Drew McIntyre, and Damian Priest coming for Fatu's title all at once, it will be interesting to see if he can walk out of WWE Backlash with his title.Also read: WWE SmackDown Results & Highlights (5/2/25): Huge tag team main event, new title match made for Backlash 2025 and more","WWE is moving fast towards its next Premium Live Event, Backlash.

Gujarat Titans aim to recover from the blow dealt by young sensation Vaibhav Suryavanshi when they face a struggling Sunrisers Hyderabad in an IPL match tonight (May 2).Suryavanshi stunned GT with his incredible performance, hitting the season’s fastest century in just 35 balls and becoming the youngest IPL centurion at only 14 years and 32 days old.Despite an eight-wicket loss — post a strong 209/4 score — the result hasn't altered GT's position in the league. The Titans remain one of the most consistent teams this season, boasting a balanced squad with strengths in both batting and bowling.Led by Shubman Gill, they sit comfortably with six wins out of nine matches (12 points). Just two more wins from their last five fixtures would secure a spot in the playoffs, reaching the 16-point threshold.GT's in-form top order gives them confidence, especially with standout Sai Sudharsan, who is second in the Orange Cap race with 456 runs and five fifties. Gill (389 runs) and Jos Buttler (406 runs) also rank among the season’s top batters, making a formidable trio despite recent challenges.Earlier this season, GT defeated SRH convincingly in Hyderabad by seven wickets, thanks largely to Mohammed Siraj's impressive 4/17 spell. They’ll be hoping for a similar performance this time.Meanwhile, SRH find themselves in a critical position, needing wins urgently. The runners-up last season have struggled — just three wins in nine matches — and sit ninth on the points table. Another loss could effectively eliminate their playoff hopes.While SRH have seen flashes of brilliance from openers Abhishek Sharma and Travis Head, consistency remains elusive for the team.The pitch at Narendra Modi Stadium favours the batters, which should benefit SRH. In five of the eight matches played at Motera, teams have scored over 200 runs, highlighting the batting-friendly conditions. Bowlers are likely to struggle, particularly in the second innings, as dew is expected to make an impact.Shubman Gill (C), Sai Sudharsan, Jos Buttler (WK), Sherfane Rutherford, Shahrukh Khan, Washington Sundar, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Sai Kishore, Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh KrishnaImpact sub: Karim Janat/Ishant SharmaTravis Head, Abhishek Sharma, Ishan Kishan, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Heinrich Klaasen (WK), Aniket Verma, Kamindu Mendis, Pat Cummins (C), Harshal Patel, Simarjeet Singh, Zeeshan AnsariImpact sub: Mohammed ShamiGujarat Titans squad : Shubman Gill (Captain), Jos Buttler (wk), B Sai Sudharsan, Shahrukh Khan, Sherfane Rutherford, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Kagiso Rabada, Ravisrinivasan Sai Kishore, Mohammad Siraj, Prasidh Krishna, Ishant Sharma, Washington Sundar, Glenn Phillips, Anuj Rawat, Mahipal Lomror, Arshad Khan, Jayant Yadav, Nishant Sindhu, Kulwant Khejroliya, Gerald Coetzee, Manav Suthar, Kumar Kushagra, Gurnoor Brar and Karim Janat.Sunrisers Hyderabad squad : Pat Cummins (c), Ishan Kishan (wk), Atharva Taide, Abhinav Manohar, Aniket Verma, Sachin Baby, Smaran Ravichandran, Heinrich Klaasen (wk), Travis Head, Harshal Patel, Kamindu Mendis, Wiaan Mulder, Abhishek Sharma, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Mohammed Shami, Rahul Chahar, Simarjeet Singh, Zeeshan Ansari, Jaydev Unadkat, Eshan Malinga.In Ahmedabad on Friday, temperatures are expected to be quite hot, reaching up to 44°C during the day.

NEW DELHI: Just days after lighting up the cricket world with a jaw-dropping 35-ball century, 14-year-old Rajasthan Royals prodigy Vaibhav Suryavanshi has once again stunned fans — but this time, not with the bat.The young sensation from Samastipur, Bihar, who smashed 11 sixes in a whirlwind knock at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur, became an overnight star. His innings, against an attack featuring the likes of Ishant Sharma, Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh Krishna, Washington Sundar, Rashid Khan, and Karim Janat, was the second-fastest century in tournament history.Now, ahead of Royals' IPL 2025 clash against Kolkata Knight Riders on Sunday, Suryavanshi turned heads again — but this time during a net session with the ball in hand.In a stunning moment, the teen bowled to a batter in the nets and produced massive turn, shattering the stumps clean in half. Teammates and staff were left in disbelief at the sheer skill and impact of the delivery.From a batting sensation to a potential all-rounder in the making, Suryavanshi’s talent continues to amaze — and he's only 14.RR bowling coach Shane Bond had revealed that the team management is ‘protecting’ the young star.“The coaching staff haven’t tried to complicate things too much with Vaibhav. He’s sort of got a bit of a license to go out and just play, which he’s done an amazing job so far, really, for a 14-year-old. So look again, he missed out in the last game, but for us, you don’t really want to panic with someone so young, you just come out and plug in tomorrow,"" Bond said at the pre-match press conference.“I know Vikram (Rathour) talks about his game plans and the type of bowlers that he’s going to come up against and he’ll do that again for this match, but outside of that, he’s a pretty young kid, so I’m just happy for him to get out there and keep swinging. It’ll be that again,"" he added.“He’s (Vaibhav) obviously a seriously talented player, but he’s also still a kid. So, he’s sort of learning on the go, we’re going to be really patient with him because you have to be. And the other part of it is just all the off-field stuff, the travel (and such), you can’t expect a 14-year-old to be a professional. Like I’ve got a 16-year-old son and he’s a teenager, so we’re just trying to educate him on the things around and look after him, shield him a little bit from the social media stuff and all the trappings that come with the way he started, but he’s a lovely kid,"" Bond said.","14-year-old Vaibhav Suryavanshi has once again stunned fans with the bat.

NEW DELHI: Shikhar Dhawan , the charismatic former Indian cricketer, has often made headlines for his on-field heroics and infectious energy.But recently, it's his personal life that has caught the spotlight.After navigating a public divorce and emotional custody battle, Dhawan now seems to be stepping into a new chapter — and at the centre of it is a woman named Sophie Shine .Sophie, now 35, is an Irish national currently based in Abu Dhabi , where she holds a senior role as a Product Consultant at the Northern Trust Corporation.A graduate in marketing from the Limerick Institute of Technology, Sophie has carved out a successful career in the corporate world.

NEW DELHI: India and Royal Challengers Bengaluru star batter Virat Kohli has finally opened up about his decision to retire from T20 internationals following India’s triumphant T20 World Cup campaign in 2024.Kohli called time on his T20I career after India, led by Rohit Sharma , clinched the T20 World Cup title with a thrilling seven-run win over South Africa in the final held in Barbados.In the high-octane final, Kohli delivered when it mattered the most, scoring a crucial 76 off 59 balls, earning him the Player of the Match award.Moments after lifting the trophy, Kohli announced his retirement from T20Is during the post-match presentation. Soon after, Rohit Sharma and Ravindra Jadeja also confirmed their retirements from the format.Speaking on the RCB Podcast, Kohli explained the reasoning behind his decision.“I do not think things have changed for me in any way. The decision to leave T20Is was taken purely understanding that there is a new set of players who are more than ready and they need time,” he said.“They need a two-year cycle to evolve, handle pressure, play in different parts of the world, and play enough games to the point where when the World Cup comes, they feel like they are ready.”Kohli finished his T20I career with 125 matches, amassing 4,188 runs at an impressive average of 48.69. He was named Player of the Tournament in both the 2014 and 2016 editions of the T20 World Cup.Currently, Kohli is showcasing top form in the ongoing IPL 2025 , leading the charts for RCB with 443 runs in 10 matches at an average of 63.29.RCB, placed second in the points table, are set to face Chennai Super Kings in a key encounter on Saturday.",Virat Kohli has announced his retirement from T20 internationals.

NEW DELHI: Romario Shepherd walked in, saw the ball, and launched it into orbit — that’s the kind of explosive intent he brought when Royal Challengers Bengaluru were desperate for quick runs. Coming to the crease with RCB reeling at 159 for 5 in 18 overs, Shepherd turned the game on its head in spectacular fashion.The West Indian powerhouse etched his name in IPL folklore by smashing a 14-ball fifty, making it the joint-second fastest half-century in IPL history.

If that wasn’t enough, he took on death-overs specialist Matheesha Pathirana in the 20th, smashing 2 sixes and 2 fours to power RCB to a massive 213/5.A proven force in the death overs, Shepherd’s record is staggering: 128 runs off just 42 balls in overs 19 and 20, with a strike rate of 304.76, 10 fours, 13 sixes, and just two dismissals — the hallmark of a true finisher.13 - Yashasvi Jaiswal (RR) vs KKR, 202314 - KL Rahul (PBKS) vs DC, 201814 - Pat Cummins (KKR) vs MI, 202214 - Romario Shepherd (RCB) vs CSK, 2025*128 off 42, two dismissals, SR: 304.76, 10 fours, 13 sixes",Royal Challengers Bengaluru were bowled out for 159 in 18 overs.

Giannis Antetokounmpo and Tyrese Haliburton’s father’s altercation stole the spotlight at Gainbridge Fieldhouse



Fans reacted to Giannis Antetokounmpo’s confrontation with Tyrese Haliburton’s father

The Indiana Pacers edged out a dramatic 119-118 overtime victory against the Milwaukee Bucks . While Tyrese Haliburton 's game-winning shot over Giannis Antetokounmpo lit up Gainbridge Fieldhouse, the postgame headlines were stolen by a courtside altercation between Giannis and Haliburton's father, John. Fans online are not happy with John’s move, as many are asking the NBA to ban him from the playoffs.Giannis Antetokounmpo was making his way off the court when John Haliburton approached him, waving a towel with his son's face on it and allegedly yelling, “This is what we do.” The bold move did not sit well with the two-time MVP, who interpreted the act as a blatant show of disrespect. Giannis responded, and the two ended up in a tense face-to-face standoff that required players and staff from both benches to intervene.Giannis later addressed the confrontation: “I believe in being humble in victory. That’s who I am,” he said in his postgame comments. “Some people will say when you win the game, you can talk s___ and say it’s a green light for you to be disrespectful. I disagree. I’ve won a championship, they haven’t.”The Bucks star added, “I feel like that’s very, very disrespectful.”Tyrese Haliburton didn’t shy away from the issue either. Addressing the incident in his postgame press conference, he took accountability for his father’s actions. “As far as the incident between Giannis and my pops, I had no idea until I got to the back and was shown the video. I don’t agree with what transpired... I don’t think that my pops was in the right at all there.”Fans online quickly shared their thoughts on the matter. Many demand a ban on John Haliburton from the NBA games as a form of punishment.“Better be banned for the rest of the playoffs for this dumb s*it,” one fan wrote on X.“Father should be banned for rest of playoffs,” another echoed the same.“Father a bad example of sportsmanship,” another wrote.“I’m glad i saw this angle cause Hali dad was deff in the wrong for taunting Giannis after a big loss like that,” another shared.“What a clown,” one fan condemned the action of John.“Why is he seeking out a 7 foot Greek god like that.

A lavish video with a sarcastic punch

Logan Paul - Still Humble (Official WWE Music Video) ft. YNG Martyr

Behind the scenes and star reactions

I Made Logan Paul's WWE Theme Song

The official theme song, created in collaboration with Australian rapper YNG Martyr , was released on Paul's YouTube channel and is now the centrepiece of his WWE entrance. Packed with luxury visuals and tongue-in-cheek lyrics, the video blends Paul’s trademark arrogance with a layer of self-mockery, reinforcing his role as one of WWE’s top villains.The video features Paul in private jets, mansions, poolside setups, and even a WWE ring - all symbolic of his over-the-top persona. It kicks off with the cheeky line, “How can I be so good-looking and still humble?” and continues to build on the mock-humility theme with lyrics about wealth, fame, and online haters.Fans online were quick to latch onto the song’s satirical tone. Comments ranged from “Bro is so humble he barely said anything in his own song” to “The least humble person making a song about how humble he is - best rage baiter 2025.” One user summed it up aptly: “This goes hard, and it fits his character perfectly.”The song already has hundreds of thousands of views and continues to trend, adding another successful digital project to Paul’s growing WWE résumé.YNG Martyr, who worked on the track and video, shared behind-the-scenes clips revealing how the idea came to life. Filmed in Puerto Rico, the production included late-night brainstorming sessions, high-end casino outings, and an all-access WWE shoot.WWE stars have also chimed in. Liv Morgan’s infamous mugshot, originally part of the video, was eventually cut - much to her amusement. Rhea Ripley, who also didn’t make the final edit, joked, “Autotune too? Damn. Didn’t think you were that lame.”Paul also took the opportunity to troll Dominik Mysterio backstage, showing him a spoof clip featuring his wife, Liv Morgan, and former on-screen partner Rhea Ripley all in one frame - a nod to ongoing WWE storylines and social media buzz.Following his high-profile win over AJ Styles at WrestleMania 41, Paul has now called out new World Heavyweight Champion Jey Uso. The tension escalated on RAW, with Paul getting super kicked by Uso, only to retaliate later with a surprise backstage attack.As WWE Backlash nears, fans are already speculating that Paul could make a legitimate run for the top title in WWE? If Logan Paul’s music video and recent momentum are anything to go by, he’s not just creating buzz - he’s turning it into storyline gold.","Logan Paul's official WWE theme song has been released.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

UK Magic Circle to honour woman thrown out for 'masqueradeing' as man,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-magic-circle-to-honour-woman-thrown-out-for-masqueradeing-as-man/articleshow/120584411.cms,"Representative Image (AI)

LONDON: Over 30 years after Britain's elite Magic Circle expelled a woman for posing as a man to gain admittance, the formerly male-only society is to welcome her back as a full member.The London-based international magic organisation ejected Sophie Lloyd after she masqueraded as a male in 1991 to win membership.But after her story came to light last year, the society's first female chair Laura London launched a search to track down Lloyd and apologise.She was eventually located living abroad and will later on Thursday be presented with a membership certificate at a special ceremony at the organisation's London headquarters.""It is so exciting after all these months tracking Sophie... I can't tell you how happy we are as a society to welcome her back into the fold,"" London told BBC radio.Lloyd posed as Raymond Lloyd for 18 months before unmasking herself as a woman.But members, who voted to admit women in September 1991, were so angered by her ""deliberate deception"" that they went ahead with her expulsion.The deception was in fact a two-person act involving the late magician Jenny Winstanley, who recruited Lloyd to help her prove that women magicians were just as good as men.""I did a 20-minute show in front of 200 people, three examiners, and spoke to the examiner for an hour-and-three-quarters afterwards,"" Lloyd said, recalling how she managed to pull the wool over everyone's eyes.After the Magic Circle changed its stance on allowing women in, Winstanley, who died in 2004, phoned the society to explain.""Two days later we got a letter to say Raymond's been expelled,"" said Lloyd.""We couldn't get our heads round it. We just thought, 'come on it's funny, it's amusing' but they didn't think so and Jenny was completely snubbed, unfortunately.""After the expulsion, Lloyd continued to perform magic for 11 years in an anti-bullying variety show before eventually moving overseas.She said the Magic Circle had changed out of all recognition in the 30 years since she was thrown out, adding: ""This is for Jenny really, Jenny would have loved it.""London said Thursday's ceremony would also be a chance to recognise Winstanley both for her contribution to magic and her audacious trick at the Magic Circle's expense.""I just think she's a wonderful woman and I know she'd have loved to be here and I just wish more than anything I could have met her myself,"" she said.The Magic Circle was founded in 1905 by around 20 magicians at a restaurant in London's Chinatown district.Members must vow never to give away the secrets of magic.Although women have now been admitted to the Magic Circle for over 30 years, they still make up only around five percent of the society's 1,700 membership.The body says, however, that increasing numbers are now coming through in the 10-18-year-old age group.","Sophie Lloyd was expelled from the Magic Circle after posing as a man to gain admittance.

IPL 2025: RCB vs CSK preview | CSK, RR out, SRH on the brink

'VIRAT'S SUPPORT IS HUGE FOR YASH'

Poll Do you think Yash Dayal's performance has improved since joining RCB? No, it has worsened No, it has remained the same Yes, slightly Yes, significantly

NEW DELHI: It must have been déjà vu for Yash Dayal when he was handed the final over by skipper Rajat Patidar on Saturday. It was the same scenario he faced in IPL 2024: same team ( RCB ), same opponent ( CSK ), same venue (M. Chinnaswamy Stadium ), and the same batter on strike ( MS Dhoni ).In 2024, Dayal had to defend 17 runs; this time, it was 15. Back then, despite being hit for a massive six off the first ball by Dhoni, Dayal held his nerve, pulling things back and leading RCB to a thrilling win that secured their playoff spot while sending CSK packing.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW! On Sunday, Dayal once again found himself entrusted with the crucial task by his captain, with the legendary Dhoni on strike. The atmosphere in the stadium was tense, but Dayal remained ice-cold.The final over was a spectacle of nerves and drama. CSK needed 15 runs to salvage some pride in what had been a dreadful campaign. Dayal gave away a single to Dhoni on the first ball and another single to Jadeja on the second. Then came the turning point: on the third ball, Dayal dismissed Dhoni and shifted the momentum in RCB’s favour.Shivam Dube entered with CSK needing 13 from 3 balls.Then, chaos. A waist-high no-ball gave Dube a free hit, which he smashed for six. The equation suddenly changed — 6 needed off 3 balls.With just six required from three, Dayal kept his composure. He bowled a single to Dube on the fourth ball, and Jadeja couldn’t make an impact on the penultimate ball, also taking a single.Now, it was down to 4 runs needed from the final ball. Dayal exchanged a brief word with Patidar. The tension was palpable, but Dayal calmly took his run-up and delivered a low full-toss. Dube connected hard, sending the ball to long-on, but only managed two runs.RCB dugout, players on the field and thousands in the stands erupted. Not only did the win lift them to the top of the points table, but it also marked another clutch finish from Dayal — his calmness under pressure proving decisive once more.A unique stat: In both the 2024 and 2025 instances, Dayal dismissed Dhoni.Despite the no ball and the six, another person who remained cool under pressure was his father, Chanderpal Dayal, watching from Allahabad. At no point did he doubt the outcome, knowing full that Yash would pull through.""It’s never over till the last ball is bowled in cricket. Yash is more mature now. I’m sure even the fans had given up — my family did too. But I was confident that Yash would pull it off. And he did. His calmness was the key in this match,"" Yash Dayal's father told TimesofIndia.com in an exclusive interview.""I was watching the 2024 match — he was in the same situation, and Dhoni was there too. When Patidar handed him the last over this time, I was literally smiling. The skipper knows Yash well. The management has shown a lot of trust in him. Virat has supported him immensely since he joined RCB. He’s the reason Yash is performing so freely, without any baggage on his shoulders""Virat hamesha bolte hain usko darr ke nahi, bindas khel, khul ke khel [Virat always tells him to not play with fear, but to play freely and with confidence],"" the father said.Dayal has burried the 2023 nightmare a long back. While playing for Gujarat Titans, Dayal had to defend 29 off the final over against Kolkata Knight Riders. KKR's hard-hitting batter Rinku Singh hit five consecutive sixes off Yash Dayal to give his team a dramatic victory.Dayal became the butt of jokes on social media. He was released by Gujarat Titans ahead of IPL 2024 Auction. But, RCB showed faith in him and bought him for Rs 5 crore. He was also retained by RCB prior to the 2025 season.“I would like to thank RCB for showing faith in me and for retaining me. I couldn’t have asked for a better team to play for. RCB believed in me even in my lowest moments. That is very special for me,” said Dayal on social media ahead of the season.Dayal's father Chandrapal revealed how Kohli helped Dayal in tough times.""He always said 'Papa bhul jao uss episode ko, mai yaad nahi karna chahta. Bahot aage jana hai [Papa, forget that episode. I don't want to remember it. Have to go a long way]'. He was never down, even after getting hit by Rinku Singh. I am really thankful to RCB for showing trust in him and supporting him,"" the father said. Virat Kohli has supported him a lot. When Yash joined RCB, Virat would often call him to his room — and sometimes, he would go to Yash’s room himself. They discussed that over [from 2024], and Virat told him one thing: ‘Keep working hard, toofan macha de. Main hoon tere saath. Chinta mat karna. Mehnat karna mat chhodna. Galtiyan karna, par seekhna aur aage badhna.’ (Keep working hard, create a storm. I’m with you. Don’t worry. Never stop putting in the effort. Make mistakes, but learn and move forward). Virat has given him a lot of freedom and turned him into a fearless cricketer,"" the father said.""Maine kaafi cricketers ko tootate hue dekhe hai, espcially bowlers ko par Virat ne apne haath se joda hai [I have seen many cricketers break down, especially bowlers, but Virat has connected them with his own hands],"" Chandrapal signed off.","Royal Challengers Bengaluru's Yash Dayal was handed the final over by Rajat Patidar on Saturday. It was the same scenario he faced in IPL 2024: same team ( RCB ), same opponent ( CSK ), same venue (M. Chinnaswamy Stadium ) and the same batter on strike ( MS Dhoni ). In 2024, Dayal had to defend 17 runs; this time, it was 15. Back then, despite being hit for a massive six off the first ball by Dhoni,.

Astrologer Greenstone Lobo: Is Yuzvendra Chahal's India career over?

NEW DELHI: The fans at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium were on the edge of their seats as Royal Challengers Bengaluru edged out Chennai Super Kings in a nail-biting thriller that went down to the final ball. From the outset, the contest promised nerves and fireworks — and it delivered on all counts.Half-centuries from Virat Kohli and Jacob Bethell, followed by Romario Shepherd’s explosive finishing touch, powered RCB to a formidable total. In response, 17-year-old Ayush Mhatre stole the spotlight for CSK, forging a crucial partnership with Ravindra Jadeja to take their side within touching distance of a stunning win. But in the end, CSK fell just two runs short.The final over, bowled by Yash Dayal , was a theatre of nerves and drama. With CSK needing 15 off 6 and Dhoni and Jadeja at the crease, the pressure was immense. Dayal conceded single off the first two deliveries . On the third delivery, he removed the legendary Dhoni, swinging the match back in RCB’s favour.Then came chaos — a waist-high no-ball that gave Dube a free hit and the left hander whacked the pacer for a maximum. With six needed off three, Dube managed just a single. Jadeja took another single to bring the equation to four off just one ball.Four were needed off the final ball, Dayal bowled a low full-toss, Dube struck it to long-on, but RCB’s fielding held strong. Only two runs were scored.Dayal’s calm under pressure sealed a memorable win for RCB, lifting them to the top of the points table amid wild celebrations.Chasing a daunting 214, CSK were powered by a brilliant 114-run partnership between 17-year-old Ayush Mhatre and veteran Ravindra Jadeja. Mhatre, playing with maturity beyond his years, smashed 94 off 48 balls with nine fours and five sixes, while Jadeja remained unbeaten on 77 off 45 (8x4s, 2x6s).However, their valiant effort couldn’t carry CSK over the line, as they finished on 211/5 in 20 overs.RCB’s Lungi Ngidi turned the tide with key wickets, returning with impressive figures of 3/30, including the crucial breakthroughs of Mhatre and Sam Curran.Earlier, RCB posted 213/5 after being put in to bat. Jacob Bethell (55 off 33) and Virat Kohli (62 off 33) gave the hosts a flying start, adding 97 runs for the first wicket. But it was Romario Shepherd who provided the real fireworks at the death. Coming in late, the West Indian bludgeoned 53* off just 14 balls — the fastest fifty of the season and joint second-fastest in IPL history — hammering four fours and six sixes in a stunning display.For CSK, Matheesha Pathirana bowled with fire and accuracy, picking up 3/36 in his four overs.With this thrilling win, RCB not only bagged two crucial points but also moved to the top of the points table. For CSK, it was a bitter pill to swallow, as a remarkable chase fell just short in one of the most dramatic finishes of the season.","Royal Challengers Bengaluru edged out Chennai Super Kings in a nail-biting thriller that went down to the final ball.

NEW DELHI: Chennai Super Kings' young star Dewald Brevis found himself at the centre of a major controversy during their IPL 2025 clash against Royal Challengers Bengaluru at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium on Saturday.In a high-stakes chase, Brevis was dismissed for a golden duck on his very first ball after being adjudged LBW to Lungi Ngidi.While the delivery looked to be sliding down leg, Brevis hesitated to take a review and was eventually denied the chance — the 15-second DRS timer had expired.The South African batter, caught in a moment of doubt, discussed the decision with non-striker Ravindra Jadeja before finally signalling for DRS.But it was too late. Replays later confirmed that the ball would have missed the stumps comfortably, sparking widespread criticism of both the on-field umpire’s decision and the rigidity of the DRS timing system.Visibly frustrated, Brevis and Jadeja briefly argued with the umpire, but the decision stood.Watch:Many fans and experts felt the youngster was hard done by, with some questioning whether players should be given more flexibility to review controversial calls, especially in such a crucial game.The missed review came back to haunt CSK, who eventually fell short by just two runs while chasing RCB’s formidable 213/5.Despite heroic efforts from 17-year-old Ayush Mhatre (94 off 48) and Jadeja (77 not out off 45), the Super Kings ended at 211/5. Brevis’s early exit proved pivotal, as one more boundary could have swung the match CSK’s way.The game had it all — blistering fifties from Virat Kohli, Jacob Bethell, and Romario Shepherd for RCB, and a stunning near-chase by CSK.But it was the DRS drama involving Brevis that will remain the most talked-about moment from a thriller that pushed RCB to the top of the points table.","Chennai Super Kings' Dewald Brevis was dismissed for a golden duck on his very first ball.

World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka secured her third Madrid Open title by defeating Coco Gauff 6-3, 7-6 (7/3) on Saturday in Madrid. The victory marked her tour-leading 31st win this season, adding to her previous titles in Brisbane and Miami, while also matching Petra Kvitova's record of three women's Madrid Open titles .Sabalenka dominated the first set after Gauff's initial hold, winning 17 consecutive points and establishing a 4-1 lead with breaks in the third and fifth games.The 26-year-old Belarusian secured the first set in 35 minutes when Gauff sliced wide on the second set point.""Getting to six finals sounds crazy, to be honest... I work hard and I know that if I bring my game and if I fight for every point that I'm capable of that. But to actually like do it for real, I was like, okay, this is cool. This is ... like a dream. I really hope that I'm going to keep doing what I'm doing and keep playing the way I'm playing right now.""21-year-old Gauff, the 2023 US Open champion, showed more resistance in the second set, breaking in the third game and consolidating for a 3-1 advantage.At 5-4, serving for the set, Gauff faced difficulty with double faults and saved three break points before Sabalenka eventually claimed the break.A notable moment occurred when Sabalenka dropped her racquet during a rally, looking at the crowd in bemusement.The match concluded in a tie-break where Sabalenka secured multiple championship points before Gauff's double fault handed her the victory.""You know, like now probably Iga is not doing well, which is absolutely fine, and I know that she's going to come back. I'm just working for the future, like trying to improve my game as much as I can, just so I'm ready for whoever is going to bring the challenge on court.""The victory was particularly significant as Sabalenka had finished as runner-up last year, losing to Iga Swiatek, whom Gauff defeated in this year's semi-final.This win represented Sabalenka's sixth final appearance this year and the 37th of her career, marking her fourth final in five years at Madrid.The three-time Grand Slam champion's current form positions her as a leading contender for the French Open, where Swiatek claimed her last title almost a year ago.The result brought Sabalenka level at 5-5 in head-to-head matches against Gauff.""Overall there's a lot of positives to take but I'm obviously disappointed with maybe how I played today. I feel like I could have showed up better,"" Gauff reflected after the match.","Aryna Sabalenka beats Coco Gauff 6-3, 7-6 (7/3) in Madrid Open final.

prediction

Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) will be desperate to turn their fortunes around at Eden Gardens when they face Rajasthan Royals (RR) in a crucial IPL clash on Sunday. With four league matches left, the equation for the defending champions is clear: win all four and qualify for the playoffs.Skipper Ajinkya Rahane, recovering from a hand injury, confirmed his intent to play: “I’m fine. I’m trying my best and hopefully I’ll play the match on Sunday.”KKR have struggled at home this season, with just one win from five outings. Their spinners have failed to exploit home conditions, and the batting unit has underperformed. Vice-captain Venkatesh Iyer, re-signed for Rs 23.75 crore, has been underwhelming with only 142 runs in 10 games.Rinku Singh and Quinton de Kock have also failed to fire consistently, making KKR's task steeper. However, their recent 14-run win over Delhi Capitals, led by Sunil Narine’s all-round brilliance, has reignited belief.Eliminated RR, meanwhile, have little to lose and could play party spoilers. With captain Sanju Samson absent and Jos Buttler gone, RR’s young guns will need to step up to salvage pride in what’s been a disappointing campaign.There’s a lush covering of grass, especially around the good and short of a length areas, promising consistent bounce and pace at Eden Gardens. Early swing is expected in the powerplay, so pacers must pitch it up and make the most of the movement. Unlike typical Eden conditions, the even grass cover means spinners may find it tough, with little turn likely. This pitch looks set for a high-scoring contest, but the new ball will be crucial. Early wickets could tilt the game, so exploiting swing early on will be key for the bowlers before it becomes a batter’s paradise.Rahmanullah Gurbaz (wk), Sunil Narine, Ajinkya Rahane (c), Venkatesh Iyer, Rinku Singh, Angkrish Raghuvanshi, Andre Russell, Rovman Powell, Harshit Rana, Anukul Roy, Varun ChakaravarthyImpact Player – Vaibhav Arora/Ramandeep SinghYashasvi Jaiswal, Vaibhav Suryavanshi, Nitish Rana, Riyan Parag (c), Dhruv Jurel (wk), Shimron Hetmyer, Wanindu Hasaranga, Jofra Archer, Maheesh Theekshana, Sandeep Sharma, Yudhvir Singh CharakImpact Player - Akash Madhwal/Shubham DubeyAjinkya Rahane (c), Rinku Singh, Quinton de Kock (wk), Rahmanullah Gurbaz (wk), Angkrish Raghuvanshi, Rovman Powell, Manish Pandey, Luvnith Sisodia, Venkatesh Iyer, Anukul Roy, Moeen Ali, Ramandeep Singh, Andre Russell, Anrich Nortje, Vaibhav Arora, Mayank Markande, Spencer Johnson, Harshit Rana, Sunil Narine, Varun Chakaravarthy and Chetan Sakariya.Sanju Samson (c), Riyan Parag, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Shimron Hetmyer, Shubham Dubey, Vaibhav Suryavanshi, Dhruv Jurel (wk), Kunal Singh Rathore, Yudhvir Singh Charak, Nitish Rana, Sandeep Sharma, Tushar Deshpande, Akash Madhwal, Kumar Kartikeya, Kwena Maphaka, Wanindu Hasaranga, Maheesh Theekshana, Fazalhaq Farooqi, Ashok Sharma and Jofra Archer.Played: 31KKR wins: 15RR wins: 14No Result: 2Expect a damp start to the day in Kolkata with a couple of soaking morning showers, particularly around 11 AM when cloudy skies and rain are likely.

But what sets Kohli apart is how he has stepped up in big matches, often carrying RCB’s hopes against one of the most tactically strong sides in the league.His current form in IPL 2025 is reminiscent of his record-breaking 2016 season.Kohli has now recorded four consecutive fifty-plus scores, equaling his own RCB record set nine years ago.1146 - Virat Kohli vs CSK*1134 - David Warner vs PBKS1130 - Virat Kohli vs DC1104 - Virat Kohli vs PBKS1093 - David Warner vs KKR1083 - Rohit Sharma vs KKR10 - Virat Kohli*9 - Shikhar Dhawan9 - David Warner9 - Rohit Sharma4 - Virat Kohli in 20164* - Virat Kohli in 2025","Virat Kohli holds the record for most runs by a batter against a single opponent in IPL history.

Shubman Gill will be a very good leader for India: Rashid Khan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/shubman-gill-will-be-a-very-good-leader-for-india-rashid-khan/articleshow/120853130.cms,"Shubman Gill (PTI Photo/Arun Sharma)

NEW DELHI: Rashid Khan , Afghanistan's T20I captain , expressed on Saturday that Shubman Gill would emerge as an exceptional leader for both Gujarat Titans in the IPL and the Indian cricket team . This season, Gill has demonstrated remarkable leadership , amassing 465 runs across 10 matches at an average of 51.66, including six half-centuries.""Shubman Gill, this is his second year leading the team and he has been getting better and better each and every game,"" Rashid shared during a media interaction.""In the future definitely he is going to be one of the very, very good leaders for India, not only GT but for India as well. He has those qualities and skills. But it's very important that you have that good connection with the head coach where he makes those things a little bit easier for you,"" he added.Gujarat Titans have demonstrated impressive performance with seven victories in 10 matches, showing substantial improvement from their eighth-place finish last season under Gill's captaincy.""Last year things just didn't go our way,"" Rashid reflected.""We were trying our best but it just didn't go our way. Some results, you know, we could have had them in our way but didn't go.""""But it's quite important that you have that good relation and understanding between the head coach and the captain and I feel like Ashish bhai and Shubman bhai, they both have that kind of great understanding and that's quite important,"" Rashid noted.The Afghan spinner highlighted Gill's exemplary leadership whilst discussing GT's success in the current IPL season.""It's overall a team effort. Starting from Ashish bhai, how he manages the team, then captain Shubman Gill, how he manages the inside and then how he is leading from the front.""That's something which sets an example for us as a player that, yes, the captain is leading from the front. To be honest, we just keep the things simple. The simpler we keep, the better we perform. We don't really much think about the result but we really think about the process and the mindset and the preparation,"" Rashid explained.Addressing his own performance of seven wickets in 10 matches this season, Rashid acknowledged room for improvement.""Its a tough question like a tough season for me,"" he admitted.""Even if you see from yesterday's bowling (against Sunrisers Hyderabad) as well, I didn't bowl even 40 per cent of what I have been known for. The length and the line, that's something which gives me a clear idea that yes, it's not just about the batter, I missed my line and length.""If I miss my line and length on any day, I feel any batter is going to score runs against me. I think the length and the line was missing but I just need to focus on that. Next game I play, I just focus on hitting the right area consistently and that's something which will make me more effective in the game,"" he elaborated.Regarding the tournament standings, Rashid stated, ""This competition does not allow you that, yes we have seven games and we need to win one more to lock ourselves in the top four. Mumbai Indians have five or six back-to-back wins and the game against them will be big for us.""","Afghanistan's T20I captain Rashid Khan believes Shubman Gill will emerge as an exceptional leader for both Gujarat Titans in the IPL and the Indian cricket team.
