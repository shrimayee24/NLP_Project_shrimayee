In a format where supremacy is often short-lived and margins razor-thin, the team has an opportunity to defend a men’s T20 World Cup title — an achievement that would further strengthen their legacy in the shortest format. India are also aiming to become the first nation to lift the T20 World Cup trophy on home soil.A successful campaign would also make India the first team to win the men’s T20 World Cup three times.India’s journey in the tournament began with glory in the inaugural edition in 2007, when they defeated Pakistan in the final at the New Wanderers Stadium in Johannesburg under the captaincy of Mahendra Singh Dhoni. That iconic triumph laid the foundation for India’s dominance in T20 cricket.The second title, however, came after a long wait. Seventeen years later, India returned to the summit in 2024, with Rohit Sharma leading the side to a memorable title win. India edged past South Africa in a thrilling final to finally end their prolonged title drought.Now, with momentum on their side, India will look to script another historic chapter in T20 World Cup history.","India begin their T20 World Cup 2026 campaign against USA on Saturday.

COLOMBO: It was barely five minutes after the match was over at the Premadasa Stadium on Sunday when Hardik Pandya and Shivam Dube were back in the middle, bowling on the practice pitches. No over-the-top celebrations, no outpouring of emotions, just a sense of another routine victory against a Pakistan team that India don’t think are their match at the moment.The 61-run win, the fourth on the bounce after their hat-trick of victories against their once arch-rivals in the Asia Cup, have now ensured a Super-8 spot for India. A lot had happened in the build-up to this game and even on Sunday, the much-anticipated handshakes between the captains didn’t happen.While the unease off the pitch persisted, India were just too much when the ball rolled. Even a few months ago, Ishan Kishan (77 off 40 balls) wasn’t even close to a spot in the Indian T20 team. But now that he is there, the 27-year old is proving that he can give his teammate Abhishek Sharma a run for his money as the best T20 opener in the world.Abhishek’s early dismissal on a slow Premadasa track could have been a big blow, but not when Ishan was in the form that he is in. The Pakistan bowlers were dealt with disdain and the cuts and sweeps that the Jharkhand boy unleashed took India to 52 runs in the first six overs, which was at least 20 over par on this track.“The pitch was not that easy. Sometimes, you just have to believe and focus on your strengths. I was just watching the ball, sticking to my strengths and making them run as much as possible,” Man of the Match Kishan said at the end of the match.After his exit, India showed smartness to reach a total of 175 against some quality spin, pushing Pakistan into taking tremendous risks right at the beginning of their chase.They were not up for it with Jasprit Bumrah (2-17) and Hardik Pandya (2-16) doing the early damage. The spinners, who bowled 18 of Pakistan’s 20 overs, came into play for India only after the pacemen had all but sealed the deal.“This is for India. We played the brand of cricket we wanted to play. We thought 175 was 15-20 runs over par — 155 would have made it a very tight game,” captain Surya Kumar Yadav said, as the thousands of touring Indian fans went home a happy lot.",India beat Pakistan by 61 runs to reach the Super-8 stage of the Asia Cup. Ishan Kishan (77 off 40 balls) is the Man of the Match for India. Jasprit Bumrah (2-17) and Hardik Pandya ( 2-16) took the other two wickets.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128399810,imgsize-40888,width-400,resizemode-4/128399810.jpg"

London Exile To Dhaka Throne: Tarique Rahman Set To Be Bangladesh PM, What Does This Mean For India?

NEW DELHI: India will be represented by Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla at the swearing-in ceremony of Bangladesh PM-elect and BNP chief Tarique Rahman on Tuesday, as the BNP returned to power in Dhaka with a landslide mandate.Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla will be accompanied by foreign secretary Vikram Misri at the event, ANI sources confirmed on Sunday.In a formal announcement of Om Birla’s participation in the Dhaka ceremony, the ministry of external affairs stated, “The Honourable Speaker’s participation in this important event underscores the deep and enduring friendship between the peoples of India and Bangladesh, reaffirming India’s steadfast commitment to the democratic values that bind our two nations.”The ceremony will be held at the South Plaza of the national parliament following the BNP's sweeping victory in the 2026 general election.Bangladesh has sent invitations for the ceremony to leaders of 13 countries, including India.The BNP is set to form the next government in Dhaka after securing a decisive mandate in the 13th national parliament elections held on February 12.The outcome marks the party’s return to power after nearly two decades, with Tarique Rahman poised to assume office as prime minister, in line with the party’s earlier announcement.According to the election commission, results for 297 seats have been declared so far. BNP candidates have won 209 seats and are leading in two constituencies where results are currently suspended. The party’s allies have secured three additional seats, taking the BNP-led alliance’s total to 212 seats. In comparison, Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami has won 68 seats, while its allies in the 11-party alliance have secured nine more, bringing their combined tally to 77 seats.Following the BNP’s victory in the neighbouring country, Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated Tarique Rahman in a social media post.The BNP also thanked PM Modi for his congratulatory message after the party’s win.In a post on X, it said, ""Thank you very much, Honourable @narendramodi. We greatly appreciate your kind acknowledgment of Tarique Rahman's leadership in securing the BNP's decisive win in the national elections.”This comes amid fluctuating relations between New Delhi and Dhaka after former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was toppled during major unrest in Bangladesh in August 2024. She subsequently took refuge in India and remains in exile due to safety concerns.Meanwhile, Hasina’s arch-rival party, the BNP, has now secured power in Dhaka, and the diplomatic trajectory between India and Bangladesh will be closely watched in the coming days.",Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla will be accompanied by foreign secretary Vikram Misri at the event.

Pakistan’s reliance on spin against India in Colombo entered the record books after they bowled 18 overs of spin in a single T20 World Cup innings, equalling the tournament record.Led by Salman Ali Agha, Pakistan sent down 18 overs of spin, matching the most spin overs delivered in a T20 World Cup innings. The only other time 18 overs of spin were bowled in an innings in a T20 World Cup match was when Pakistan used the same approach against Australia at the same venue in the 2012 edition.Other spin-heavy efforts in T20 World Cup history include Afghanistan’s 16 overs of spin against England in Delhi in 2016 and against West Indies in Nagpur in the same year. Pakistan also bowled 16 overs of spin against the USA in 2026.The 18 overs of spin against India also places the game among the most spin-dependent innings in all T20Is between full-member teams. Zimbabwe bowled 18 overs of spin against West Indies in Port of Spain in 2010.

Axar Patel press conference: 'We see them as a team, don't see rivalry' after India beat Pakistan

NEW DELHI: India’s emphatic triumph over arch-rivals Pakistan in the ICC T20 World Cup wasn’t just another win — it was, in Sachin Tendulkar ’s words, a takeover scripted in the powerplay itself.The batting icon summed up the night’s defining phase in a post on X. “The powerplay was where India took the game away from them. Ishan Kishan in the first innings, and the clinical bowling we saw in the second innings, made all the difference. We were always in the driver's seat. India rocked it tonight,” he wrote.That early surge came despite a shaky start. After Abhishek Sharma fell for a duck, Kishan unleashed a counterattack, smashing a brutal 77, off just 40 balls, that shifted momentum instantly. Tilak Varma added a steady 25, before skipper Suryakumar Yadav (32), along with Shivam Dube (27) and Rinku Singh (11 not out), delivered a composed finish to lift India to 175/7. Saim Ayub (3/25) was Pakistan’s standout bowler with three wickets.If Kishan seized the initiative, India’s bowlers sealed the verdict. Hardik Pandya , Jasprit Bumrah and Axar Patel tore through the top order, reducing Pakistan to 34/4 inside powerplay.Usman Khan fought alone with 44, but Varun Chakaravarthy and the rest ensured Pakistan were bundled out for 114 in 18 overs.Former opener Virender Sehwag didn’t hold back either. “Ishan Kishan played like a real Dhurandhar. Among all minnows Pakistan looked like the easiest to beat for Bharat because of their 17th century approach to T-20 cricket, and they have taken a proper beating as usual.

TimesofIndia.com in Colombo:

T20 World Cup: India humiliate Pakistan again

On a surface where timing was a luxury and survival itself felt like an act of resistance, Ishan Kishan produced one of the most belligerent innings of the ongoing T20 World Cup.Against Pakistan, on a R Premadasa Stadium pitch that gripped, turned and repeatedly forced batters to check their strokes, Kishan played an innings that lifted India to 175 for 7.The left-hander scored a stroke-filled 77 off 40 balls, while the rest of the Indian batters managed only 98 runs off 80 deliveries.From the very start, the signs were unmistakable. When Shaheen Afridi dug one in short, Kishan swivelled and sent it soaring into the stands. It was not reckless bravado. It was intent. With purchase for the spinners, Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha opened the bowling himself and got rid of Abhishek Sharma, the batter everyone was talking about before the match.What transpired was a four-ball duck for Abhishek, who is yet to open his account in the T20 World Cup. Salman's decision to open the bowling turned out to be a masterstroke. After three dot balls, Abhishek decided to go for a hoick, but the delivery was not there to pull and he miscued it to mid-on, where Shaheen completed an easy catch.Kishan understood early that Pakistan wanted the surface to do the damage. His answer was to stay ahead of it.Spin arrived quickly, and with it came the real examination. The off-spin of Salman Ali Agha and Saim Ayub found turn straightaway, with the ball holding up and deviating sharply off a length. Kishan responded not by retreating into defence, but by expanding his options. Sweeps, slog-sweeps, reverse hits and inside-out strokes flowed in succession, forcing Pakistan’s fielders into constant recalibration.The fifty came off just 27 balls, pumped straight back over the bowler’s head, and it told a story larger than numbers. This was Kishan batting with clarity, reading lengths early and trusting his hands even when his feet were not always planted. At one point, a possible cramp on right leg did little to slow him down. If anything, it sharpened his resolve.Against Abrar Ahmed’s googlies, Kishan showed rare adaptability. When the length was full, he went straight. When it was short, he rocked back and pierced the gaps. Even mistimed strokes fell safe, a testament to how deep Pakistan were forced to set their field. The message was clear. Defensive lines would not work.The most brutal phase came against Shadab Khan. A floated delivery on middle disappeared into the crowd via a ferocious slog-sweep. Another drifted down leg and was punished behind square. Pakistan’s plan of strangling India in the middle overs was being dismantled ball by ball.What made the innings stand out was not just the strokeplay, but the context. This was not a flat track designed for excess. The pitch demanded patience, yet Kishan refused to be trapped by it. He understood that in a high-pressure India-Pakistan contest, momentum matters as much as runs. Every boundary dented belief, every six silenced Pakistani fans in the stands.His dismissal, fittingly, came through craft rather than force. Saim Ayub slowed it down, drew Kishan across the crease and let the surface do the rest. The ball gripped, turned and clipped the top of middle and leg. Pakistan celebrated with visible relief.But, by then, the damage was done.Kishan walked back to a standing ovation, his 77 off 40 balls having completely altered the trajectory of the innings. On a pitch where run accumulation felt like wading through sand, he had sprinted. In a match where margins are thin and conditions often dictate terms, this was an innings that stood apart. It was fearless without being reckless, aggressive without being careless. More than anything, it was a reminder that in the biggest games, the bravest batters do not wait for conditions to improve. They bend them to their will.","Ishan Kishan produced one of the most belligerent innings of the ongoing T20 World Cup.

India vs Pakistan prediction: Greenstone Lobo reveals the winner

There was no handshake after the match between India and Pakistan at the T20 World Cup clash in Colombo, continuing the icy stand-off that began during the Asia Cup last September.“I will break the suspense tomorrow. Wait for 24 hours,” Suryakumar Yadav had said on the eve of the match. Twenty four hours later, the message was clear and unambiguous. There would be no handshakes.The frost between the two sides remained evident not only at the toss but also after the game. Just as in their meetings during the Asia Cup in Dubai last year, the players did not exchange handshakes once the contest ended on Sunday.On the field, India produced a commanding performance. Opener Ishan Kishan ’s supersonic 77 off 40 balls powered India to 175 for seven after being asked to bat first on a tacky surface. He shared an 87 run stand with Tilak Varma, whose contribution was 11, as Kishan dominated the Pakistan attack.The match began on an unusual note with Pakistan skipper Salman Ali Agha bringing himself on for off spin in the first over and dismissing Abhishek Sharma, who holed out to Shaheen Shah Afridi. Saim Ayub, who finished with 3 for 25, and Agha kept the pressure on during the power play.Kishan, however, turned the tide. He pulled Afridi for a towering six and then dismantled the spinners.Abrar Ahmed and Shadab Khan were struck for boundaries and sixes as Kishan raced to a 27 ball fifty. He eventually fell trying to carve Ayub over mid wicket, missing the ball and losing his stumps.Pakistan clawed back through Ayub, who removed Tilak Varma and Hardik Pandya off successive deliveries to leave India at 126 for four. Suryakumar Yadav made 32 off 28 balls, while Shivam Dube added 27 off 17. A 15 run final over from Afridi, in which Dube and Rinku Singh attacked, carried India to 175 for seven.In reply, India’s bowlers never allowed Pakistan to settle. Hardik Pandya struck in the opening over to dismiss Sahibzada Farhan for a duck. Jasprit Bumrah followed with a double strike, removing Saim Ayub and Salman Agha as Pakistan slumped to 13 for three.Axar Patel bowled Babar Azam and later dismissed Usman Khan, who top scored with 44 off 34 balls. A brief 39 run partnership between Usman and Shadab Khan offered resistance before another collapse set in.Varun Chakravarthy claimed two wickets in the 16th over, and Hardik returned to take the final wicket as Pakistan were bowled out for 114 in the 18th over. Hardik, Bumrah, Axar and Varun took two wickets each, while Kuldeep Yadav and Tilak Varma picked up one apiece.",There was no handshake after the match between India and Pakistan at the T20 World Cup clash in Colombo.

He even landed in the Sri Lankan capital three days before the match.“Pakistan is no match for India.

But this time, I feel we have an upper edge because we know the conditions better,” says Usama.The toss will take place at 6:30 PM local time and IST, but fans from both countries began lining up as early as 1 PM. All stadium gates will open to the public at 3:00 PM. A Sri Lanka Cricket official confirmed to TimesofIndia.com that all tickets have been sold out.Approximately 2,000 police officers and nearly 600 military personnel have been deployed to maintain security and regulate traffic for the match.Sri Lanka Mirror, a local daily, has reported that India’s RAW intelligence agency, Indian security personnel, as well as private security officers assigned to the players, have arrived in Colombo to provide security for Indian players and spectators. It is also learnt that Pakistan’s security and intelligence agencies have reached Colombo to coordinate and assist with the security arrangements.Prasanna, who runs an Airbnb on Havelock Road, complains about not getting a match ticket for his die-hard Hardik Pandya fan.“No tickets for the locals,” he laughs. “We are only here to provide hospitality to our Indian and Pakistani friends.”Ryan de Silva, an ardent Mumbai Indians fan who also drives a tuk tuk, says he too wanted to see Suryakumar Yadav, Hardik Pandya and Jasprit Bumrah in action.“I have been trying to get a ticket to see my Mumbai boys in action for a month, but I didn’t get lucky,” says de Silva, a Lasith Malinga fan.After so much build-up, the stage is set for the battle between two bitter rivals, and both captains admitted in their pre-match press conferences that this is far more than just a game.“If you play any game, there is always pressure. When you play India-Pakistan, it is more about the occasion. No matter how much you say it is just another game, at the back of your mind you know which game you are playing,” Suryakumar Yadav said.Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha echoed similar views. “This game between India and Pakistan has always been a high-magnitude match and will continue to remain so in the future.”Former England captain Michael Atherton, in his column for The Times, described the India-Pakistan contest as a “toxic and politicised spectacle.”Atherton argued that the fixture has become too big to fail, underpinning the fragile global cricket economy, even as it serves as a proxy for political point-scoring.Yet, his view comes with privilege. Ask the vendors outside the R Premadasa Stadium selling flags, the cafe owners, or the tuk tuk drivers who have waited for this match since the schedule was announced.“Today I will earn more than ten times what I make in a month,” says a 55-year-old vendor selling jerseys outside the stadium.The India-Pakistan game will always matter.

Abhishek Sharma is back and India to unravel a mystery slinger

NEW DELHI: Former India cricketer Harbhajan Singh has come out in support of young Indian batter Abhishek Sharma after former Pakistan pacer Mohammad Amir called him a “slogger” ahead of the big India vs Pakistan match in the T20 World Cup 2026.Harbhajan strongly disagreed with Amir’s comment and said Abhishek is a proper and skilled batsman, not someone who just blindly hits the ball.Amir had earlier made the remark while speaking on a Pakistani TV show, which sparked debate ahead of the high-voltage clash.Also See: IND vs PAK Live Score T20 World Cup 2026 Reacting to it, Harbhajan praised Abhishek’s batting ability and consistency. He said, ""Abhishek Sharma is a quality player, and he is a player who is determined to win matches on his own. And not once, but he can do it again and again. I have played cricket, and I know that he is a proper batter who has all the shots; a lot of batsmen don't have all the shots. A slogger is someone who only sees the ball and slogs; if it connects, great, and if it doesn't, that's fine too. He is not like that. He hits the first ball. And as long as he is on the crease, he keeps hitting. So, he is a proper batsman.""Harbhajan also said it is unfair for critics who have never bowled to Abhishek to judge him.He added, ""People may say whatever they want. Because, in my opinion, I don't think they have ever bowled in front of such a batter, and hence, it is wrong to comment that Abhishek is a slogger.""He urged Abhishek to prove his talent on the field, saying, ""If I tell you the definition of a slogger, then a lot of people will get angry. So, I don't want to say that. Because we don't operate on that level, that they say something and we react again and again. I don't want to do that. Because maybe he wants us to react.""But, anyway, I'll say, Abhishek, show us tomorrow what you showed us before. And show us, what Abhishek can do. And I have a lot of hope from Abhishek. And if he plays for a long time, then Team India will set a very long score.""",Former India cricketer Harbhajan Singh has come out in support of young Indian batter Abhishek Sharma.

Inside India vs Pakistan Drama: Who Blinked First? | T20 World Cup 2026 Explainer

NEW DELHI: Defending champions India sent a strong message to the cricketing world with a 61-run demolition of Pakistan in their high-stakes Group A clash at the R. Premadasa Stadium in Colombo on Sunday, securing their spot in the Super Eights.“I think this is for India,” said captain Suryakumar Yadav after India's big win.“We played the same brand of cricket we wanted to play. Batting first was the better option on this wicket. Ishan thought something out of the box. After 0/1, someone had to take responsibility and the way he took it was amazing.”The defining moment came at the top as Ishan Kishan unleashed a breathtaking 77 off 40 balls, including 10 fours and three sixes, to put India firmly in control. Tilak Varma (25) and Suryakumar Yadav (32) added crucial support, ensuring India reached 175/7 despite a challenging surface. Shivam Dube’s quickfire 27 in the death overs pushed the total to a competitive 176.Pakistan’s reply never gained momentum. Hardik Pandya struck in the first over, dismissing Sahibzada Farhan for a four-ball duck. Jasprit Bumrah then tore through the top order, sending Saim Ayub and captain Salman Agha back to the pavilion inside two overs. Usman Khan offered resistance with a fluent 44, stitching minor partnerships with Babar Azam and Shadab Khan, but his stumping to Axar Patel ended any faint hopes of a comeback.The Indian bowlers were ruthless in unison. Kuldeep Yadav trapped Mohammad Nawaz, Tilak Varma removed Shadab Khan, and Varun Chakaravarthy added two late wickets. Pandya, after seeing a couple of catches go down off his bowling, ensured the finale by knocking back Usman Tariq’s middle stump. Pakistan’s innings folded for 114 in just 18 overs, their third-lowest T20 World Cup total.“It was great to see everyone contributing with the ball,” Surya said.“We’ll go back, have a good time together as a team and then think about the other games when we take the flight to Ahmedabad,” he said.","Defending champions India beat Pakistan by 61 runs in their T20 World Cup Group A clash.

NEW DELHI: India’s dominant 61-run victory over Pakistan in their high-voltage T20 World Cup clash in Colombo not only secured a place in the Super Eights but also produced a fiery on-field moment involving Hardik Pandya and Kuldeep Yadav that quickly went viral on social media.The incident occurred during the 18th over of Pakistan’s chase, when Hardik Pandya was bowling to Shaheen Afridi. Afridi pulled a short delivery towards long-on, where Kuldeep Yadav was stationed near the boundary.Despite getting both hands to the ball, Kuldeep failed to complete the catch, instead allowing it to go for a six. Moments earlier, Ishan Kishan had also dropped a chance behind the stumps off the same batter.Visibly furious, Pandya pointed towards both fielders and shouted at them, using a couple of expletives in frustration. The animated reaction displayed the intensity of the India-Pakistan rivalry and the pressure of a World Cup match, even though India were firmly in control of the game.However, Pandya quickly backed up his aggression with performance.He kept his composure and won the match for India in the same over, bowling Usman Tariq with a full delivery that crashed into the middle stump. Pandya finished with figures of 3 overs, 16 runs, and 2 wickets, playing a key role in wrapping up Pakistan’s innings for just 114 in 18 overs.Earlier, India had posted a competitive total of 175/7, largely thanks to Ishan Kishan’s superb 77 after an early wicket. Suryakumar Yadav and Shivam Dube added valuable runs to push the total beyond Pakistan’s reach on a pitch that was expected to assist spinners.Pakistan’s chase collapsed early as Jasprit Bumrah struck twice in the powerplay, reducing them to 13/3. Usman Khan’s 44 was the only notable contribution, but the rest of the batting lineup failed to handle India’s pace and spin attack.",India beat Pakistan by 61 runs in their T20 World Cup clash in Colombo.

Afghanistan vs UAE

England vs Italy

Australia vs Sri Lanka

Three crucial group stage matches are set to be played on February 16 in the ICC T20 World Cup 2026, with qualification scenarios beginning to tighten across groups.The day begins with a Group D clash between Afghanistan and the United Arab Emirates. Afghanistan are still searching for their first win of the tournament after suffering defeats to New Zealand and South Africa. Their loss to South Africa was particularly heartbreaking as the contest was decided after two Super Overs, leaving them fourth in the standings.Afghanistan have shown glimpses of resilience but have struggled to convert strong phases into victories. They were outplayed by New Zealand in their opener, yet pushed South Africa to the limit in a dramatic encounter. Sharper decision making in key moments will be essential if they are to keep their Super 8 hopes alive.The UAE have experienced contrasting fortunes. After a heavy 10 wicket defeat to New Zealand, they bounced back strongly to edge past Canada in a tight contest. That win has given them renewed confidence and a valuable foothold in the group heading into this important fixture.The second match features England taking on Italy in Group C.England moved up to second in the standings after a vital win over Scotland. Their campaign has been uneven so far. They were stretched by Nepal, beaten by West Indies, and then recovered with a composed chase against Scotland. While the win steadied their progress, concerns remain over their top order consistency.Italy, meanwhile, are gaining belief. After a heavy defeat in their opening game, they responded with an impressive victory over Nepal to register their first World Cup win. Their discipline with the ball and confidence at the top of the order stood out. Facing England presents a far sterner test, but Italy will look to build on their momentum and challenge an established side.The final and most significant contest of the day sees Australia face Sri Lanka in a match that could shape Australia’s tournament fate. A defeat would not mathematically eliminate Australia, but it would leave them needing an extraordinary turnaround in their final game. For Sri Lanka, victory would secure qualification for the Super Eights.Australia’s recent loss to Zimbabwe has intensified scrutiny. Questions have been raised about both their batting depth and bowling strike power, particularly after managing only two wickets in that defeat. The injury to Mitchell Marsh has further complicated their campaign, especially with some players short of form and match practice.Sri Lanka enter the clash with momentum. They defeated Ireland and Oman convincingly, with Kusal Mendis , Pavan Rathnayake and captain Dasun Shanaka producing half centuries. Kamindu Mendis also impressed earlier in the tournament. With a confident batting unit and growing rhythm, Sri Lanka have the tools to test an Australia side under pressure.",Afghanistan take on the United Arab Emirates in Group D. England take on Italy in Group C. Australia take on Sri Lanka in the final game of the tournament. England are second in the standings after a vital win over Scotland. Sri Lanka are third in the group after wins over Ireland and Oman.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128389498,imgsize-1172162,width-400,resizemode-4/australia39s-travis-head-and-sri-lanka39s-pavan-rathnayake.jpg"

Chris Paul’s rise from rookie of the year to perennial All-Star

Chris Paul's retirement marks the end of a historic statistical legacy

Chris Paul, one of the best and most respected point guards in NBA history, has officially called it quits after 21 seasons in the NBA. Confirming the end of his storied career, the 40-year-old made the announcement in an emotional statement. Paul embodied elite leadership, precise playmaking, and fierce competitiveness over the next two-plus decades, cementing a legacy as one of the greatest floor generals in the history of the sport.Paul has been a consistent Hall of Fame-level talent since back when he was a teenage legend. The retirement closes the book on a career that spanned three eras of the NBA and signals the end of one of the most impactful careers the league has seen.Chris Paul was the fourth overall pick in the 2005 NBA Draft, selected by the then-New Orleans Hornets; he quickly became a franchise player. Winning the NBA Rookie of the Year award in 2006, he was soon distinguished by his nearly unparalleled awareness on the court, his ball handling, and his defensive acumen.During his career, Paul was named to 12 NBA All-Star selections, received 11 All-NBA honors, and nine consecutive All-Defensive Team nods.His leadership made several franchises better, and most famously, he led the Los Angeles Clippers to heights they had never reached before, guiding the “Lob City” era and making the team a regular playoff team.Aside from his stint with the Clippers, Paul played a pivotal role for the Houston Rockets, Oklahoma City Thunder, Phoenix Suns, Golden State Warriors, and San Antonio Spurs. He took the Suns to the 2021 NBA Finals, two wins short of clinching the elusive title that eluded him during his Phoenix playing days.Chris Paul's retirement was swift, but it ended a career filled with records and consistent greatness. He's 2nd all-time assists and steals 2nd respectively, arguing his position as the greatest playmaker and best perimeter defender of all-time. Reinforcing his blend of scoring and distribution, Paul has scored more than 20,000 points while recording over 10,000 assists.Paul should have a room full of those fine letters, but no NBA title ever be displayed, crowning his résumé. He was president of the National Basketball Players Association, a trusty mentor to younger stars, and an embodiment of professionalism and basketball smarts.","Chris Paul has announced his retirement after 21 seasons in the NBA.

While Brad Marchand’s reason for exclusion is unknown at this time.

At present, the status of Morrissey’s injury is unclear, but if he is unable to return, his roster spot will be difficult to replace after Canada officially registered 25 players on February 10.Announcing the same on X/Twitter, Steven Ellis stated, “Both Brad Marchand and Josh Morrissey are listed as scratches for Canada today against Switzerland. Jordan Binnington also went dress. #Olympics.” Meanwhile, according to Kyle Bukauskas, ""Brad Marchand is taking a rest, too."" It is expected that Marchand will be back, but for now, he can recharge and get ready for the upcoming important matches.As per reports, in place of these players, Carolina’s Seth Jarvis will make his Olympic debut. He will play alongside Bo Horvat and Sam Reinhart on Canada’s third line. The other three forward lines will remain untouched, with Sam Bennett serving as the 13th forward.

Since then, both Bad Bunny and Kendall Jenner have moved on in their respective lives with other people.While Bad Bunny’s picture at the 68th Annual Grammy Awards with Kendall Jenner’s best friends, Hailey Bieber, and Justin Bieber did spark rumors of a reunion, nothing has been confirmed yet.Neither Bad Bunny nor Kendall Jenner have commented on rumors of them rekindling their romance yet.Despite their high profile relationship coming to a dramatic end, it seems both remain on friendly terms as Kendall Jenner was even spotted enjoying Bad Bunny’s record breaking performance at Super Bowl LX halftime show.While Bad Bunny’s show broke records, his performance has also divided citizens across the country and the world.To make things worse, President Donald Trump has brutally slammed Bad Bunny’s performance at Super Bowl LX.President Donald Trump took to social media to post, “The Super Bowl Halftime Show is absolutely terrible, one of the worst, EVER! It makes no sense, is an affront to the Greatness of America, and doesn’t represent our standards of Success, Creativity, or Excellence…”However, Bad Bunny has stayed away from commenting on it.","A clip of Bad Bunny and Kendall Jenner leaving together in a luxurious car has sparked chaos among fans.

Zimbabwe’s 23-run win over Australia in the ongoing T20 World Cup has also drawn attention to a past trend involving India in global tournaments. On earlier occasions when Zimbabwe defeated Australia in a World Cup, India went on to lift the title.Zimbabwe recorded the first major upset of the ongoing T20 World Cup, defeating former champions Australia by 23 runs on Friday at R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo.This was only the second time Zimbabwe have beaten Australia in this format. The previous win came in the 2007 edition of the tournament.After being asked to bat, Zimbabwe scored 169 for 2, led by opener Brian Bennett’s unbeaten 64 and contributions from other top-order batters. Australia were then bowled out for 146 in 19.3 overs on a slow pitch.In the 2007 edition, Zimbabwe, under Prosper Utseya, had beaten Australia by five wickets with one ball remaining in a low-scoring match in Cape Town.Blessing Muzarabani took 4 for 17. Brad Evans claimed 3 for 23, while Wellington Masakadza (1/36) and Ryan Burl (1/9) also picked up wickets.Chasing 170, Australia lost early wickets and were reduced to 29 for 4 in 4.3 overs.Josh Inglis (8), Travis Head (17), Cameron Green (0) and Tim David (0) were dismissed cheaply.Matt Renshaw scored 65 off 44 balls, while Glenn Maxwell made 31. Australia were 38 for 4 at the end of the Powerplay and 67 for 4 at the halfway stage, needing 103 more runs.Renshaw and Maxwell added 77 runs for the fifth wicket in 9.5 overs to revive the chase. The partnership ended when Maxwell edged a delivery from Ryan Burl onto his stumps.Australia needed 56 runs from the last five overs. Marcus Stoinis, who had earlier left the field after being struck during the Zimbabwe innings, was dismissed for 6.Brian Bennett took a catch near the boundary to dismiss Ben Dwarshuis (7), giving Brad Evans his third wicket.Australia required 34 runs from 12 balls but lost Renshaw and Adam Zampa (2) in the 19th over. Matthew Kuhnemann (0) was run out in the final over.Earlier, Zimbabwe’s top order combined well against the Australian attack to set up the total of 169 for 2.Australia are yet to beat Zimbabwe in the T20 World Cup, having lost both meetings. Zimbabwe had also defeated Australia by 13 runs at Trent Bridge in the 1983 ODI World Cup when the side was led by Kim Hughes.On both previous occasions when Zimbabwe beat Australia in a World Cup, India went on to win the tournament.In 1983, Kapil Dev’s team stopped West Indies from winning a third consecutive title.

NEW DELHI: Zimbabwe pulled off a major upset in Group B of the ICC Men's T20 World Cup, defeating Australia by 23 runs at the R. Premadasa Stadium on Friday. After posting 169 for 2, Zimbabwe successfully defended the total, bowling Australia out for 146 in 19.3 overs.Despite the setback, stand-in Australia captain Travis Head urged calm, pointing to their turnaround in the 2023 ODI World Cup after a shaky start.""We've been there before. I said at the toss, we saw it in 2023 with a few defeats and injuries. We have a few guys here who were there in India in 2023 and we'll look to navigate this situation and use that blueprint.""Head explained that the decision to field first was influenced by the nature of the pitch, which he believed would play consistently across both innings. He felt the target was within reach.""We thought it's a good wicket. A bit tacky at the start and we thought it would be even through the two innings. Even though we only took two wickets, I thought they were a bit under par.""But we lost early wickets and came under pressure. They played well. I still felt like we'd have taken the score and were happy to chase that.""The feedback throughout was that it was a good wicket. We put ourselves under pressure by losing wickets.We found a partnership in the middle but we left ourselves with too many.""Australia’s campaign has also been impacted by injuries. Mitchell Marsh remains unavailable with a groin problem, while Tim David recently returned from a hamstring strain.Their pace resources are stretched as well, with Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood missing — marking the first time since 2011 that Australia are competing at a World Cup without Cummins, Hazlewood and Mitchell Starc together.","Zimbabwe beat Australia by 23 runs in Group B of ICC Men's T20 World Cup.

BELAGAVI: On a scrubby, wind-beaten stretch of rocky hills near Ugargol village in Saundatti taluk, a lean, bare-chested figure moves with practised ease. For nearly a decade, Budan Khan Hosamani has called the forested slopes of Heggolla home — claiming to have survived on raw leaves and wild greens, far from the prying eyes of civil society.Locals have christened the 34-year-old the ""Modern-Day Tarzan"", a comparison inspired by his muscular build, minimal clothing and apparent comfort in the wild. The analogy may be a touch dramatic — there are no jungle vines or cinematic leaps here — but Budan's life in the forest undeniably set him apart.""I like living in the forest, not in public,"" he says.Budan claims to have spent the past 10 years in the hills, sustaining himself on nearly 80 varieties of edible leaves and plants endemic to the region. He insists he does not eat cooked food, rice or roti, and no longer finds conventional meals appealing.His daily routine includes long walks, yoga and exercise — practices he credits for helping him digest raw vegetation.His unusual diet, he says, was learned from observing monkeys. ""I watched what they eat and what they avoid,"" Budan explains. Studying their habits, he claims, helped him identify safe leaves and steer clear of harmful ones.Residents of Ugargol recall that Budan left home about a decade ago. His mother and two brothers still live in the village. ""I told my mother, I won't come home,"" he says, adding that he left home when relatives pressured him to get married. Though the family later let him have his way, he had, by then, adapted fully to a sylvan life.Despite living in isolation, a mobile phone is one gadget that Budan has kept with himself for emergencies.In the end, whether modern-day Tarzan or solitary seeker, Budan remains a man who chose the wild — and has stayed his course.","Budan Khan Hosamani has lived in the forested slopes of Heggolla for nearly a decade.

NEW DELHI: Faridabad may not be an obvious cradle of motorsport prodigies, but for Arshi Gupta, geography has never been a barrier.At just nine, she has already etched her name into Indian motorsport history, becoming the youngest national karting champion after winning the 2025 Indian National Karting Championship (micro max category, ages 8 to 11) and emerging as the only female karting champion in Asia in a mixed-gender format.Karting, by design, makes no distinction: Boys and girls line up together, helmets on, engines roaring. Talent alone decides the outcome, and Arshi's talent has spoken loudly.Her rise may appear meteoric, but behind the trophies lies a routine that would test even seasoned athletes. ""I wake up at 5 am, have breakfast, and I'm on the track from 8.30am to 4 pm,"" Arshi says. The long hours are not an occasional grind but a way of life.She embraced the schedule even more intensely before leaving for UK to train. ""She kept doing it because she enjoyed it,"" her relatives say.Arshi began karting at seven. Two years later, she stood atop the national podium — her journey built on discipline, sacrifice and relentless preparation. During the 2025 national season, she delivered multiple victories, including commanding wins in Chennai and Bengaluru, and excelled on neutral tracks where drivers are given equal practice time.""Neutral tracks bring out pure skill,"" says her father, Anchit Gupta. ""That's where Arshi performed exceptionally well.""Recognising the limitations of India's short racing calendar, the family looked abroad to sharpen her competitive edge. She trained extensively in UAE for five months, immersing herself in a high-intensity environment.The move paid off. Arshi secured a third-place finish at IAME UAE Championship, becoming the youngest Indian on an international karting podium. She followed it up with a strong fourth-place finish at Asia Pacific Motorsports Championship in Sri Lanka, competing against older and more experienced drivers.In UK, too, she adapted swiftly, steadily closing the gap to seasoned front-runners within weeks. Through it all, she has drawn inspiration from former Formula 1 world champion Max Verstappen. ""He trains very hard, and he is really professional in the way he prepares for races,"" Arshi says of her favourite driver, a reflection of the standards she has set for herself.Despite the punishing training schedule and frequent travel, academics are still firmly in her focus. ""I study on flights after races or whenever I have time. My mom teaches me,"" she says. The balancing act has earned her a principal's gold medal in school for excellence in academics and co-curricular achievements.What stands out most, however, is Arshi's composure. ""I don't get nervous. I just enjoy the sport and give my best,"" she says, betraying a mindset rare for her age and invaluable in a sport where fractions of a second define outcomes.With her selection to the F1 Academy programme, which will support her development through 2026, the road ahead looks bright for Arshi. At nine, she is not just racing competitors twice her age. She is racing against time, expectation and history. And so far, she is comfortably ahead of the pack.","Arshi Gupta is India's youngest national karting champion. She is the only female karter in Asia in a mixed-gender format.

T20 World Cup: India humiliate Pakistan again

KOLKATA: For England, Monday’s match against Italy at the Eden Gardens here should be an easy one, even though they have not been at their best in the ongoing T20 World Cup. However, the English camp is not taking anything for granted. With the Super Eights place not yet fully secured, they are not going to take their opponents lightly either. And that means no experiments.“If we’d have won against West Indies then we might have had the option, but I think we’ve just got to pick the best side possible and just make sure that we get through to Super Eights,” England skipper Harry Brook said after the win over Scotland on Saturday. That game didn’t quite turn out the way Brook had wanted and he is aware that there has to be improvements going forward.Even a below-par England might be good enough for Italy, but surely they’ll have to do better in the Super Eights. So far, the only team of some quality they faced have been the West Indies and England failed that test.The run chase has been a bit of a worry for England, with openers Phil Salt and Jos Buttler not getting them off to fliers as would have been expected.“The run chases haven’t been as straightforward as we’d have liked to,” Brook admitted, while hoping that the game against Italy would see them turning the corner.Italy know that they have to punch much above their weight to upset England and regular captain Wayne Madsen, who unfortunately had to miss out due to an injury, said his team is mentally prepared to do that. “For us to compete with the bigger teams, we have to throw punches,” he said after nets on Sunday. “We can’t just take punches. So we have to be aggressive in how we play our cricket.“We’re not just here to come and make up numbers,” Madsen warned. “We’re here to perform and to win games. We’re going to do everything in our power tomorrow to do that.”",England face Italy at the Eden Gardens on Monday in the T20 World Cup. England have not been at their best in the tournament so far.

'We weren't good enough,' says Australia's Matt Renshaw after 23-run defeat to Zimbabwe in T20 World Cup

QUALIFICATION SCENARIOS

Australia have two games left, but even two wins may not be enough to qualify for the knockouts.

If Sri Lanka beat Zimbabwe and Zimbabwe beat Ireland, Australia, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe would all finish on six points, and then the net run rate would decide who goes through.

To qualify, Australia need some outside support. They have to hope for Sri Lanka to lose to Zimbabwe or Zimbabwe to lose to Ireland.

If Australia lose to Sri Lanka on Monday, they can still survive in the tournament, but only if they beat Oman and Zimbabwe lose to both Ireland and Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka, on the other hand, need just a victory against Australia to sail into the Super Eights.

Australia arrive in Pallekele with no margin for error. The shock defeat to Zimbabwe turned their game against Sri Lanka into a must-win encounter. Another loss would leave their Super Eight hopes dependent on unlikely permutations and combinations. The equation is stark: win or pack your bags.Selection is the other area of concern. Star batter Steve Smith has arrived in Sri Lanka as cover for the injured Mitchell Marsh.But he cannot play until he is formally drafted into the 15-man squad. Australia can do that without dropping anyone because they still have a spare slot after not naming a replacement for the injured pacer Josh Hazlewood. Smith becomes a live option if Marsh misses again. The captain remains under an injury cloud after internal testicular bleeding, and his availability shapes Australia’s balance at the top of the order.Tim David is back from a hamstring issue, and Marcus Stoinis was cleared after a blow to his left hand, after he returned to bat in the Zimbabwe game.Sri Lanka, meanwhile, started clean, with two wins propelling them to the top of Group B. They are still smarting under the loss of their crafty spinner Wanindu Hasaranga, who was ruled out of this T20 World Cup with a hamstring tear. Dushan Hematha came in and already had a run, but the onus lies on Maheesh Theekshana and Dunith Wellalage. Captain Dasun Shanaka is in charge, with their pace stocks getting reshuffled.","Australia have two games left, but even two wins may not be enough to qualify for the knockouts.

T20 World Cup: India humiliate Pakistan again

Brief Scores:

MUMBAI: West Indies thrashed Nepal by nine wickets at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai on Sunday to qualify for the Super Eights of the 2026 T20 World Cup, becoming the second team after South Africa to do so.West Indies came into the tournament short of form, losing a T20I series against South Africa 2-1 in Jan and a three-match T20I series by the same scoreline to Nepal last Sept in Sharjah. However, a T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka, where they emerged as champions when both countries previously hosted the event, seemed to bring out the best in the Caribbeans.West Indies’ former captain and present head coach Daren Sammy termed the Wankhede Stadium as “lucky” for them as they played flawless cricket to beat a listless Nepal, who flattered to deceive after an impressive opener against England.The stars of West Indies’ win were their former and current captains, Jason Holder and Shai Hope. Holder, who bounced back after conceding 0-34 in two overs in West Indies’ 30-run win over England at the same venue earlier this week, took 4-27 as West Indies restricted Nepal to 133-8 after Nepal elected to bowl first on a pitch that seemed two-paced initially.In a surprising move, West Indies dropped medium-pacer Romario Shepherd, who took a five-wicket haul, including a hat-trick, in the first match.His replacement, pacer Matthew Forde, bowled superbly with the new ball and finished with 1-10 in four overs which included a maiden-wicket over in the powerplay, a rarity in T20 cricket.Chasing 134, Hope shrugged off poor scores of 0, 19 and 5 in the first three matches and led the way with 61 not out off 44 balls, with five fours and three sixes. He shared an unbeaten 91-run stand for the second wicket with Shimron Hetmyer, who stayed unbeaten on 46 off 32 balls, with four fours and two sixes.Hope and fellow opener Brandon King provided a 43-run start in 33 balls. Hope executed a straight drive off Karan KC in the third over, while King made 22 off 17 balls before he was caught at mid-on off Nandan Yadav. Hope also hit three fours off Kami in the fifth over.Nepal’s biggest disappointment with the ball was leg-spinner Sandeep Lamichhane, who conceded 0-38 in three overs as Hope and Hetmyer attacked him.Asked if the win against Nepal was sweet given West Indies’ shock T20I series loss to them last year, Hope said at the post-match press conference, “Well, that’s in the past. It’s history. Nepal played good cricket then. We’ve got to stay in the present and we’ve got to ensure we play our best crick-et because we see Nepal as a very good team regardless of who they’re playing against and where. So, we needed to bring our ‘A’ game once again today. But today, we needed to get over the line to ensure our Super 8s qualification.”West Indies’ last league game against Italy at Kolkata on Thursday is now of academic interest and they will play their first Super Eight game at the Wankhede on Feb 23. Nepal will play their final game against Scotland on Tuesday at Wankhede.Sunday’s result knocked Nepal out of the competition and left their large number of fans dejected. The heaving stands fell silent as the West Indian batters dominated, with Nepal’s fans finding their voice only during a late surge led by Dipendra Singh Airee and Sompal Kami. Airee made 58 off 46 balls, with three fours and three sixes, while Kami scored 26 not out off 15 balls, with four fours, as they added 54 runs in 26 balls for the seventh wicket after Nepal slipped to 73 for six in 15 overs.Nepal 133 for 8 in 20 overs (Dipendra Singh Airee 58, Sompal Kami 26; Jason Holder 4-27) lost to West Indies 134 for 1 in 15.2 overs (Shai Hope 61, Shimron Hetmyer 46; Nandan Yadav 1-24).","West Indies beat Nepal by nine wickets to qualify for the Super Eights of the 2026 T20 World Cup.

Team USA just had a brilliant opening campaign at the 2026 Winter Olympics, as the team defeated Team Latvia. The United States opened its chase for the gold medal by scoring 5-1 at Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena on Thursday (12 February). Reports suggest that it is USA Captain Auston Matthews and the team members’ scoring effort that led the team to win over Latvia in their opening match.According to reports, Toronto Maple Leafs star was one of four Americans to score in the preliminary round victory. According to TSN, Auston Matthews has scored more goals than any other player since he entered the NHL. But the goal he scored on Thursday night felt very different.The team initially faced certain hiccups in their opening match, with two apparent goals overturned in the first period after successful challenges by the Latvian bench. Despite the scoreboard remaining tied 1-1 after 20 minutes, Team USA maintained its focus and turned the tables with a dominant second period.Team USA captain Auston Matthews ’ timely score helped Team USA register its first win over Latvia at the opening match of the Winter Olympic Games of men’s ice hockey.Matthews scored the final goal in Team USA’s 5-1 win over Latvia, despite having a tough start with two goals not counting and a quick 1-1 tie, but the team managed to come back strong.Sharing his thoughts on their opening win, Team USA captain told TSN, “It’s pretty cool. This is such a special opportunity, and still feels pretty surreal to be here and be able to compete and put on this jersey and play with this group of guys. It’s a great start for us in this tournament, and we’ll look to build off it.”Matthews further spoke about the early adversities the team faced at the initial stage, “It’s fine. Those things happen all the time. You know, can’t really complain about it. The ref maybe didn’t see it. Was a little shaken up, but felt fine and just kept playing and just go from there,” he said.As per reports, Brady Tkachuk scored first at 5:29 in the first period with help from his brother Matthew. In the second period, Team USA took control as the team got three goals from Brock Nelson and Tage Thompson. Besides, Jack Hughes also had two assists on Nelson's goals, and Quinn Hughes, Matthew Tkachuk, and Jack Eichel had two assists too.Even coach Mike Sullivan appreciated the effort of the team for staying calm and following the correct game strategy.

‘This is bigger than me’





A veteran Chicago-area teacher has spoken out after resigning from his position over a Facebook post that read “GO ICE,” describing the fallout as “professionally and personally devastating and surreal. ”In his first public comments since stepping down from Gary Elementary School in West Chicago, Heidorn told Fox News Digital that the backlash over his two-word post has left him grappling with shock, grief and uncertainty about his future.“I’ve spent 14 years building my career, pouring my heart into teaching kids, building relationships and being a positive role model,” he told Fox News Digital. “To see it all upended over two simple words… felt like a severe blow to my career.”Heidorn said the emotional toll has been heavy, describing “sleepless nights” and a deep sense of loss after abruptly leaving the classroom.“Emotionally, it’s been a roller coaster, shock, sadness, anger and frustration at how quickly things escalated,” he said. “The hardest part has been losing daily contact with my students and not getting to say a proper goodbye.”He stated that his comment was a personal expression of support for law enforcement and was not directed at students or families.Beyond his personal setback, Heidorn framed the controversy as part of a broader debate about free speech.“Most importantly, this is bigger than me: it’s about whether personal opinions expressed outside of work can cost someone their livelihood without due process,” he told Fox News Digital.He said teaching has defined his life and that he had even pursued a master’s degree in educational leadership to grow in the profession. Now, he acknowledged, his future in education is uncertain.Despite the turmoil, Heidorn said he is trying to focus on his family and on support he has received from members of the community.Heidorn’s post came at a time when the nation was sharply divided over immigration enforcement, with widespread protests erupting across several US cities following the fatal shootings of Renee Nicole Good and ICU nurse Alex Pretti by federal immigration agents in Minneapolis earlier this year.Those deaths sparked demonstrations calling for accountability and changes to how agencies like ICE operate.",Heidorn resigned from Gary Elementary School in West Chicago. He described the fallout as “professionally and personally devastating and surreal.” He said his comment was a personal expression of support for law enforcement and not directed at students or families.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128395793,imgsize-42052,width-400,resizemode-4/128395793.jpg"
"No art school, just passion: Truck driver’s 21-year obsession turns into NYC’s biggest miniature marvel",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/no-art-school-just-passion-truck-drivers-21-year-obsession-turns-into-nycs-biggest-miniature-marvel/articleshow/128393655.cms,"From one building to five boroughs

A labour of Love, built between shifts

TikTok fame to museum walls

And he’s not finished yet





It started as a simple idea to build a small model of Rockefeller Center, but over 21 years it grew into a massive handmade replica of New York City, now on display at the Museum of the City of New York.Joe Macken, 63, a Queens-born truck driver now living in Clifton Park, never imagined his basement hobby would end up filling a museum gallery.Yet his 50-by-27-foot wooden metropolis, crafted painstakingly from balsa wood, cardboard, glue and acrylic paint, is now the centrepiece of the exhibition “He Built This City: Joe Macken’s Model.”“It's almost like coming in on an airplane when you're looking out the window at 4,000 feet,” Macken told news agency AFP.The journey began in 2004 after Macken, inspired by childhood memories of seeing the Panorama model at the Queens Museum, decided to carve 30 Rock. One structure led to another. Midtown followed. Then Manhattan. Eventually, the five boroughs, and even parts of neighbouring suburbs, took shape under his steady hand.Today, the model boasts an estimated 700,000 to nearly one million individual structures, from skyscrapers and row houses to bridges and boats, all scaled meticulously using a millimetre-to-10-feet formula he devised with a home ruler.“I was just going to look at it myself,” Macken has said in interviews. “I never imagined it being in a museum.”Balancing two jobs, truck driving and limousine services, along with family life, Macken carved out time late at night and early in the morning. He worked in one-foot square sections, stacking finished grids in a storage unit.Though largely accurate, the city bears Macken’s personal imprint. Handwritten notes line the waterfront edges.The skyline includes the Twin Towers alongside One World Trade Center, reflecting the view he once saw from his childhood bedroom in Middle Village, Queens. There are even charming quirks, such as a misspelled “Verazanno” Bridge, left intentionally untouched.Curators say the imperfections are part of its power. “You can see the hand of the artist,” said Elisabeth Sherman, chief curator at the museum. “It’s not machine-made precision, it’s personal.”The project gained fresh momentum when Macken’s daughter began posting videos of the miniature city on TikTok, where they garnered millions of views.The viral attention eventually led museum officials to track him down, reportedly even reaching out to an upstate bar where he was showcasing the model.Now occupying the Dinan Miller Gallery, the installation runs through August 31, 2026. Visitors are encouraged to bring binoculars, spotting a specific street among nearly a million structures can be a challenge.If the current model seems monumental, Macken insists it’s only a chapter. He is already expanding outward, building Long Island, New Jersey and Connecticut, with ambitions of a 90-foot tri-state replica that could take another decade.“I’ll just keep going,” he has said. “It relaxes me.”For a man who never attended art school, Macken’s painstaking tribute to the Big Apple stands as a testament to perseverance, and to how one building can quietly become an entire city.","Joe Macken, 63, a Queens-born truck driver now living in Clifton Park, never imagined his basement hobby would end up filling a museum gallery.

Counter-terrorism police are leading the investigation into an “American-style” stabbing of two boys, aged 12 and 13, at Kingsbury High School in northwest London.Police were called at 12.40 pm local time on Tuesday to reports of a stabbing at the comprehensive secondary school in Kingsbury. Armed police were on the scene within 13 minutes of the call.“The suspect left the scene following the stabbing. After urgent enquiries our officers arrested him and also recovered a weapon which we believe to have been used in the stabbing. We are not currently looking for anyone else,” Detective Chief Superintendent Luke Williams said.A 13-year-old boy has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder. He remains in custody where he is being questioned.Kingsbury is a multicultural area with a significant Indian ethnic population.According to local media, the arrested boy, a former pupil who had been expelled from the school for fighting, had climbed over the wall to enter the school and allegedly shouted “Allahu Akbar” as he stabbed two kids in a science lesson.He had come to target one of the boys “in revenge” and the other boy got stabbed because he set off the fire alarm. One boy was reportedly stabbed in the neck and the other in the stomach. Local media report the suspect had dressed in his old school uniform and sprayed the children and science teacher with pepper spray as he entered the classroom. Both injured boys remain in serious but stable condition in hospital. Their injuries are not life-threatening, police said. It has not been declared a terrorist incident.“At this very early stage, we are keeping an open mind as to any motivation behind this attack,” Williams added.The school went into lockdown and pupils were held in the playground. The attack has left parents and pupils petrified with some parents calling for metal detectors at the entrance.The academy school is for pupils aged 11 to 18. Its alumni include Wham’s George Michael and jazz musician Courtney Pine.","Two boys, aged 12 and 13, stabbed at Kingsbury High School in northwest London.

Two French adventurers have completed an epic journey on foot from France to Shanghai, arriving on Saturday after nearly a year and a half and crossing 16 countries almost entirely on foot.Loic Voisot and Benjamin Humblot celebrated their arrival on the Bund promenade, with Shanghai’s skyline in the background.The pair began their journey from Annecy in September 2024.""We were thinking about this moment almost every day for more than a year now, so it's a really strong feeling,"" Humblot was quoted as saying by AFP after reaching the destination.""I think first and foremost we're proud, especially of having dared to do this... We weren't sure we'd make it, but we told ourselves we'd try it out,"" he added.The pair have known each other since the age of 10 and attended secondary school and university together.They said the idea for the journey emerged during a casual conversation after work, when they realised they both wanted a “great adventure.” They decided to travel to China without flying, citing environmental concerns, and planned to make the journey on foot.""When we talked about adventure, (China) came up quickly. Then we had this slightly crazy idea of going on foot,"" Humblot said.Apart from a short stretch in Russia completed by bus for safety reasons, they walked for 518 days, covering around 12,850 kilometres (7,980 miles) before reaching Shanghai.""We're both conscious of climate change, and the responsibility humans bear for it... there are some actions we can take individually,"" Voisot, a climate consultant said, as cited by AFP.Around 50 people gathered at the starting point for the final 10-kilometre stretch, including local residents who had followed their journey on social media. Their following grew along the route, with media, French residents in Shanghai and others joining them along the way.The French duo said they faced significant challenges during the journey, including harsh winters and a desert crossing in Uzbekistan. “There were very hard winters, we had to cross the desert in Uzbekistan,” Voisot said, adding that he was proud of “having had the willpower to always keep going.”Humblot said they generally ate well during the trip but noted that they both missed French cheese.Asked what he would do first after completing the journey, Voisot replied that he would, “sleep a lot!”","Loic Voisot and Benjamin Humblot began their journey from Annecy in September 2024.

Narcisse Snake Dens: Where 100,000 snakes spend freezing winter



Why snakes depend on external warmth



Red-sided garter snakes’ facts

Adults usually grow to around three or four feet, with a sturdy build and an olive-brown to almost black body. Colour: Most have a clear yellow stripe running down the back, while the side stripes can look sharp or faint depending on the individual. A yellowish belly often shows dark edging along the scutes. The well-known red bars along the sides may appear between the scales or spread across them, giving each snake a slightly different look.

Scales: Their scales are keeled in 19 rows, and they are ovoviviparous, meaning females give birth to live young rather than laying eggs. Newborns resemble smaller, equally variable versions of the adults.

Their scales are keeled in 19 rows, and they are ovoviviparous, meaning females give birth to live young rather than laying eggs. Newborns resemble smaller, equally variable versions of the adults. Habitat: Find them near ponds, marshes, canals or slow-moving water, where they feed mostly on amphibians, along with worms and the occasional small rodent.





In the Canadian province of Manitoba, the Narcisse Snake Dens is the provincial wildlife management area, which is located in the Rural Municipality of Armstrong. These dens are the winter home of approximately 100,000 red-sided garter snakes. These sinkholes are believed to contain the largest gathering of this species anywhere on the planet. Their winter shelters lie deep within caverns carved out of water-smoothed limestone beneath the surface. When spring arrives, the snakes emerge from these underground dens and gather in the pits to mate. Once the breeding season ends, they gradually disperse into the surrounding marshlands, where they spend the summer months feeding and roaming.According to BBC Wildlife, the Narcisse Snake Dens sit in the Rural Municipality of Armstrong, where grassland meets patches of forest, and beneath the soil lies porous limestone. Several metres down, these crevices dip below the frost line but stay above the water table. That detail matters. Winter temperatures above ground can plunge to -30°C. Yet inside the caverns, it never quite drops below freezing. For red-sided garter snakes, known scientifically as Thamnophis sirtalis parietalis, it’s the perfect winter refuge.They begin arriving in late September or early October. Slipping underground and settling into tight clusters, and then they wait, five to six months. In darkness and stillness, their bodies slow dramatically, heart rates dropping as they conserve energy until the first hints of spring warmth return above.Snakes rely on external warmth to power their metabolism. So when winter locks the landscape in ice, they simply shut down. Experts say that, together, they may help reduce moisture loss and stabilise body temperature. The males reportedly emerge first, often while snow still clings to the ground. They gather near the den entrances. Female garter snakes release pheromones, which are chemical signals that males detect using their vomeronasal organ, a scent-sensitive structure in the roof of the mouth. It guides them unerringly toward the source. One female can attract dozens and sometimes hundreds.What follows is known as a mating ball. A writhing knot of snakes, all competing for position. It looks like a single, pulsing organism. Tourists stand back. Cameras out. Some fascinated. Some are clearly reconsidering their life choices. Males rub their chins along the female’s back, trying to align their bodies. When one succeeds, he uses one of his two hooked reproductive organs, called hemipenes, to transfer sperm. A gelatinous mating plug is left behind, which appears to reduce the chances of rivals mating with the same female.","The red-sided garter snake is non-venomous and generally harmless to people, though it can be surprisingly bold when cornered.

Why were Pompeii residents wearing heavy wool during August eruption? Researchers reveal new evidence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/why-were-pompeii-residents-wearing-heavy-wool-during-august-eruption-researchers-reveal-new-evidence/articleshow/128296615.cms,"Source: University of Valencia

Pompeii victims wool clothing reveals heavy layers in late summer



What does Pompeii eruption clothing hints



Final moments of victims







Pompeii has always felt strangely frozen in time. Streets halted mid-step. Meals left on tables. Bodies caught in their last movements. Mount Vesuvius erupted in late August, in the sticky heat of a southern Italian summer in CE 79.A study is nudging that certainty sideways. Researchers examining the plaster casts of victims say something doesn’t quite fit. Several people were wearing thick wool clothing and heavy layers in the month of August. It seems odd and it’s reopened a long-running debate about the actual date of the eruption and what the weather might really have been like on Pompeii’s final day.Some historians now suggest the disaster may have occurred later in the year, perhaps in autumn, when cooler air would better explain heavy garments, harvest evidence and seasonal fruits found preserved beneath the ash.The new research comes from the ÁTROPOS group at the University of Valencia. The team studied fourteen plaster casts recovered from the Porta Nola necropolis in Pompeii. These casts famously preserve the shapes of bodies and sometimes, the faint impressions of clothing that vanished long ago. Many victims appear to have been wearing a wool tunic covered by a wool cloak unlike light fabric. In four of the casts, textile impressions were clear enough to analyse the weave itself.Experts say the threads suggest thick, weighty garments.Wool was common in the Roman world. It was affordable and widely used. That part isn’t surprising but wearing two thick layers in southern Italy in late August raises eyebrows.For centuries, the eruption date of Mount Vesuvius has largely rested on the writings of Pliny the Younger. In letters describing the disaster, he places the eruption in late August. Many historians have accepted that date but archaeology has complicated things. Autumn fruits have reportedly been found in Pompeii’s ruins like pomegranates, walnuts and even evidence of wine already fermenting beyond what might be expected in high summer. On the other side, strangely some houses contained lit portable kind heaters and other small heating devices.The heavy wool garments might not reflect cold weather at all. Instead, they could have been a desperate response to the eruption itself. When Mount Vesuvius exploded in CE 79, it didn’t unleash a single blast. It was a prolonged catastrophe with hours of falling ash, toxic gases and full of darkness in the middle of the day.If ash began falling early, residents may have layered up instinctively. Grabbing what was nearby. Pulling cloaks tight as the air grew harsher. That would explain why people inside buildings and those out in open streets appear dressed in similar ways.Pompeii wasn’t destroyed instantly. The eruption unfolded over many hours. Some residents fled while others stayed. The plaster casts themselves are haunting. One of the most recognisable is a male victim whose final posture was preserved in ash, later filled with plaster. Now, researchers are reading them almost like forensic evidence. It’s striking how something as ordinary as clothing can challenge a date written nearly two thousand years ago.","Wool was common in the Roman world. It was affordable and widely used.

Crystal-filled dinosaur eggs discovered in China contain no fossilised embryos

New dinosaur egg species identified in Anhui Province

Fossil eggs help confirm the age of the rocks





Dinosaur eggs sometimes hold surprises. In eastern China, two fossil eggs were found in red sandstone layers and later cut open for study. Instead of tiny bones inside, researchers saw hollow spaces lined with clear crystals. The discovery comes from the Upper Cretaceous Chishan Formation in the Qianshan Basin, Anhui Province. The eggs are almost round, measuring about 10 to 13 centimetres in length, with shells up to 2.6 millimetres thick. Their outer shape looks ordinary. Under a microscope, the shell shows clear growth lines and tightly packed structures. Scientists have named them a new oospecies, Shixingoolithus qianshanensis. No embryo remains were preserved. What survived is the shell and the minerals that slowly formed inside after burial.According to study published in Journal of Palaeogeography , the crystals in the eggs are calcite crystals. They were not formed while the egg was still alive. Once the egg was buried in the soil, water seeped through the ground and brought along dissolved minerals. The inside of the egg had already rotted and turned into an empty space.For a long time, minerals gradually deposited in the hollow and formed clusters of crystals. This method is usual for fossils. The organic material decomposes, and minerals either replace it or fill the voids. Here the shell is quite intact, while the embryo is totally gone.Even without bones, the eggshell provides enough detail for identification. When thin slices were examined under a microscope, scientists observed uniform shell units and dense inner structures. These features differ slightly from known types.Because of these differences, the eggs were classified as a new oospecies within the Stalicoolithidae family. It is the first time this group has been confirmed in the Qianshan Basin. Other Chinese regions have produced many dinosaur eggs, but this basin had little direct evidence until now.The eggs were found in layers formed by ancient rivers and lakes. These sediments belong to the Late Cretaceous period, shortly before the mass extinction that ended the age of dinosaurs.Finding dinosaur eggs in these rocks supports their dating. Fossils like these help geologists confirm the age of rock layers and understand how the region changed over time.Only two eggs are currently preserved, and one is incomplete. Still, they add useful detail to the record of dinosaur life in eastern China, quiet evidence from a distant past.","Two fossil eggs were found in red sandstone layers and later cut open for study.

Lets Test Laurence follows MrBeast’s counting challenge with 100,001 live attempt





A new YouTuber is trying to recreate one of the internet’s most talked-about early challenges but with a small twist. Nearly nine years after MrBeast’s famous counting video helped launch his career, creator Lets Test Laurence has started a live stream where he is counting all the way to 100,001. The idea is simple: go one number beyond what MrBeast did back in 2017 and see if people watch the journey live.MrBeast’s original video, uploaded in January 2017, showed him counting from one to 100,000 in a marathon recording that lasted close to 24 hours after edits. That video later crossed tens of millions of views and became one of the early moments that pushed his channel into the spotlight. According to MrBeast’s recent appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, he said the process was less serious than it looked, explaining that he watched shows while counting instead of staring at a wall the whole time.Now, Lets Test Laurence is trying to add his own version to the idea. He began streaming on February 13 and planned to count for around 40 hours to reach 100,001.Unlike MrBeast’s pre-recorded video, this challenge is happening live, meaning viewers can watch every moment as it happens.At the latest update, Laurence had streamed for over 24 hours and reached around 40,000 while a small group of viewers watched along.The audience has stayed steady even though the stream is long and slow-paced.The attempt is clearly meant as a tribute to MrBeast’s early stunt, but it also shows how different today’s YouTube world is, where live streaming and endurance content still attract curious viewers.Many people recall MrBeast's counting video as the pivotal point that influenced his subsequent challenge-style material.Though his videos got bigger and more complex over time, many fans still view the counting challenge as the beginning of everything.Whether Laurence will actually finish counting to 100,001 is still unclear.During the stream, he even wondered out loud if he could keep going, showing how mentally tough such a simple idea can become after many hours.","Lets Test Laurence has started a live stream where he is counting all the way to 100,001.

China’s all-female police squad beats US all-male team at UAE SWAT Challenge: Reports,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/chinas-all-female-police-squad-beats-us-all-male-team-at-uae-swat-challenge-reports/articleshow/128384066.cms,"How China’s all-female police squad outperformed a US all-male team





China’s debut all-female police squad drew global attention at the UAE SWAT Challenge in Dubai, after footage aired by CGTN, China’s state-owned international broadcaster, and widely shared on social media showed the team finishing ahead of a US all-male squad in one of the event’s toughest stages. The clips indicate the Chinese women officers completed the course around 16 seconds faster while navigating a demanding sequence of shooting, sprinting and load-bearing tasks. Reported to have taken place on February 9, 2026, the performance marked China’s first appearance with an all-female team at the international competition and quickly sparked online debate.The widely circulated footage shows the Chinese women completing the obstacle course ahead of their American counterparts during the same heat. While organisers do not release detailed head-to-head timings for every matchup, the visual comparison has been repeatedly cited by media outlets and social media users as evidence of the team’s strong showing.According to competition rules referenced in media reports, teams were required to lift and carry a 120-kg tyre through part of the course. Dragging, rolling or throwing the tyre was prohibited. In the circulated clips, the Chinese squad is seen moving the load through coordinated lifts, a technique commentators say helped maintain momentum and balance under pressure.Reports identified the all-female unit as being drawn from the Sichuan Police, selected through a national qualification process involving dozens of elite police teams. Their participation marked China’s first entry of a women-only squad at the UAE SWAT Challenge, an event that regularly attracts top tactical units from around the world.The American side featured in the viral clips has been identified in media coverage as an all-male team from the Orlando Police Department. Official event rankings focus on overall team standings rather than individual matchups, which has led to the comparison being driven largely by broadcast and social media evidence.The clips prompted widespread discussion about training standards, teamwork and assumptions around gender in elite law-enforcement roles. Many commentators noted that the challenge rewards coordination, endurance and execution as much as raw strength, factors that appeared to play a decisive role in the Chinese team’s performance.Event organisers have confirmed the participation of Chinese women’s teams and the structure of the tyre-carrying challenge. The specific time margin and direct comparison with a US men’s team are based on broadcaster reporting and social media footage rather than official published score sheets.

Social media frenzy grows over Erika Kirk profile amid Candace Owens clash

Speculation erupted across social media this week after a viral screenshot suggested Erika Kirk had wiped her Facebook presence. The rumor gained traction when podcast host Baron Coleman reshared an image of a page under the name “Erika Frantzve” displaying the message “no posts available,” adding the caption: “she’s gone dark. ” Within hours, users began linking the alleged disappearance to the lingering controversy surrounding the 2025 death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk The chatter intensified because the screenshot circulated alongside commentary implying the change was long overdue. One widely shared post read, “LOL. Only took her 5 months.” The timing fueled fresh debate, especially as tensions continue between Erika Kirk and conservative commentator Candace Owens. Yet despite the online frenzy, no verified reporting confirms that Kirk deleted posts or altered her account due to the ongoing feud.Much of the confusion stems from the name attached to the screenshot. “Erika Frantzve” is understood to be Kirk’s maiden name, prompting users to question whether the page in question was official, inactive, or even related to her.Several commenters pushed back against the viral claim. One user wrote, “So we’re just lying now,” while sharing an image of Kirk’s verified Facebook page that still displayed posts featuring Charlie Kirk.Others voiced confusion rather than certainty. “Why can people leave reviews on people? Are they customers or what?” one user asked. Another wrote, “I’m a little confused. Is she back to her maiden name?” A separate commenter speculated about her marriage, stating, “She has shown that it evidently was not a good marriage. ”Experts note that a “no posts available” message can result from privacy settings, inactive profiles, or duplicate accounts rather than deliberate deletion. Without confirmation, the circulating screenshots remain inconclusive.The renewed speculation arrives amid a widening rift between Erika Kirk and Candace Owens following Charlie Kirk’s death. Owens has publicly advanced theories about the circumstances surrounding his passing and questioned leadership within Turning Point USA, though she has not provided verifiable evidence. She has also made remarks about Kirk’s marriage and personal life.As the debate spills across platforms, the episode highlights how quickly partial screenshots can spark sweeping conclusions.
