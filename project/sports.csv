NEW DELHI: The deadline for the ten franchises of the Indian Premier League (IPL) to submit their player retention lists has arrived, marking a pivotal moment in the preparation for the IPL 2025 mega auction set for the last week of November.By the end of October 31, the composition of the teams for the upcoming season will be clearer as fans would get to know which players will stay with their current teams and who will enter the auction pool.Franchises have the option to retain up to six players, with a cap of five capped players and a maximum of two uncapped Indian players.With an increased purse limit of Rs 120 crore, up 20% from the previous year, all the ten teams will be assessing the situation carefully.The cost of retaining players is predefined, with the retention of five capped players potentially depleting a team's budget by Rs 75 crore.Teams opting for fewer retentions have the strategic advantage of using the Right to Match (RTM) card during the auction, giving them the opportunity to reclaim their released players by matching the highest bid.TimesofIndia.com have taken a detailed look at each of the ten IPL franchises and their potential retentions ahead of the IPL 2025 mega auction.KKR are expected to hold on to Sunil Narine and Andre Russell, two stalwarts who have been synonymous with the franchise, as their first and second retentions. It is understood that the Kolkata-based side is yet to make a decision on whether to keep Varun Chakravarthy or Venkatesh Iyer. However, with KKR looking to let go of skipper Shreyas Iyer, retaining Ramandeep Singh and Harshit Rana will ensure all-around depth at a lower cost. Rinku Singh will also make the cut.Sunil Narine, Andre Russell, Rinku Singh, Varun Chakravarthy/Venkatesh Iyer, Ramandeep Singh, Harshit RanaTOI has already reported that Delhi Capitals will part ways with skipper Rishabh Pant.

With only two retentions, RCB seem focused on reimagining their core through the mega auction, reshaping the mould of the team.Virat Kohli, Yash DayalThe 2025 retention list could be the end of the partnership between Lucknow Super Giants and KL Rahul.

#IPL 2025: Who will lead RCB this year? Virat Kohli could well take it back!

Happy Choti Diwali to All | India NZ Ko Diwali Ka Toufa Daine Kay Liye Tayar | Basit Ali

India find themselves in an unusual territory ahead of the third and final Test against New Zealand in Mumbai. Never in the last 24 years have India been whitewashed in a Test series at home. But New Zealand, with a series-clinching 2-0 lead, have a chance to repeat that history.Defeats in Bengaluru and Pune exposed the chinks in Indian batting and have threatened India's top spot in the World Test Championship (WTC) table. Only a top-two finish in the WTC table at the end of the 2023-25 cycle will fetch India a third consecutive qualification in the final.That makes the Mumbai Test against New Zealand and the five Tests for the Border Gavaskar Trophy in Australia after that crucial to India's WTC chances.Talking about the third Test beginning at the Wankhede Stadium on Friday, former Pakistan batsman Basit Ali has said that the failure of Indian batting in the first two matches has sent alarm bells ringing and all the batsmen, especially Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma , will have to get some runs under their belt.He added that the hosts must avoid a whitewash to fly to Australia with sort of confidence.""Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, ab to unhe runs karne padenge, chahe kaisi bhi pitch ho (they will have to score now whatever the pitch be like). (Yashasvi) Jaiswal, (Shubman) Gill, Rishabh Pant, Sarfaraz (Khan) or (KL) Rahul -- all of them,"" said Basit in his YouTube video.Rohit has scored just 62 runs, while Kohli has only 88 runs to his credit in the four innings across the first two Tests against the Kiwis.""Lal mitti taiyar hai New Zealand ke liye (the red soil is ready for NZ). People are talking there will be a whitewash, but I don't think so. India should give a Diwali gift to New Zealand (by winning the Mumbai Test). If they can't, then they shouldn't think about the World Test Championship (final) anymore,"" the 53-year-old former Pakistan batsman added.While the New Zealand spinners, especially left-armer Mitchell Santner, won't mind a spinning track, it will test the Kiwi batting, especially if India decide to load their line-up with spinners.Basit expects that to be the case when the playing elevens are declared.""If it's a spinning track, then India should pick just one fast bowler (in the playing eleven). Play Kuldeep as well, all four spinners. That's what I think. You will have variation (of spinners)...you need to give flight, force them to use their feet,"" Basit reckoned.""Not taking any credit away from New Zealand. They have played top-class cricket -- especially the three left-handers (batsmen), Tom Latham, Rachin Ravindra, Devon Conway.""So India will have to do all the homework...A win is very important for their morale before the Border Gavaskar Trophy. If they go to Australia after a 3-0 whitewash at home, then they will face a lot of problems,"" he concluded.",India face New Zealand in the third and final Test in Mumbai on Friday. New Zealand lead the series 2-0 ahead of the final Test at the Wankhede Stadium.

Zac Taylor accepts blame for letting down the Bengals



In the wake of a frustrating loss to the Philadelphia Eagles , Bengals head coach Zac Taylor has come under fire for a critical fourth-down decision that ultimately sealed the team's fate. Despite Joe Burrow ’s impressive performance, the Bengals squandered their lead and fell 24-17, leaving fans and analysts alike questioning Taylor’s strategy. With criticisms of coaching and play-calling mounting, the pressure is on Taylor to adapt—or risk derailing the season. Will he learn from his missteps, or will the Bengals continue to fail?Also Read: Ciara celebrates 'Billionaire' milestone in music as Russell Wilson helps Steelers for historic victory over Giants After a disappointing loss to the Philadelphia Eagles, Bengals head coach Zac Taylor took “100%” responsibility for a critical fourth-down call that backfired. How does Joe Burrow feel about it? Despite Burrow’s solid performance, completing 26 of 37 passes for over 234 yards and a touchdown. the Bengals allowed the Eagles to come back and win 24-17, getting shut out in the final quarter.Former NFL GM Michael Lombardi criticized the team’s coaching and toughness, claiming Taylor is putting too much on Burrow and suggesting that Taylor owes him an apology.Meagher kicked off the discussion by stating, “I feel like Zac Taylor owes Joe Burrow an apology.” Lombardi agreed, emphasizing the need for change. He referenced Sean Payton’s past struggles with Drew Brees, noting, “Payton learned he had to be tougher and run the ball to win games in November and December.”Lombardi criticized Taylor's reluctance to incorporate more running plays, pointing out that the Bengals managed only 58 rushing yards compared to the Eagles’ 161. Even their sole rushing touchdown came from Chase Brown's 4-yard run. So, why can’t the Bengals emulate Jared Goff and the Lions? Goff threw for just 85 yards, yet the Lions scored an impressive 52 points against the Titans last week.Will Zac Taylor adapt his strategy, or will the Bengals continue to struggle? The answer could determine the team's fate this season.Taylor might have anticipated the media's questions, reflecting on what he deemed a mismanaged 4th-and-1 play. He admitted he didn’t provide the right guidance for his team, emphasizing the need for a more aggressive approach in that crucial moment.“I think on 4th & 1 for the primary read to be thrown behind the line of scrimmage, and that’s where the ball should have gone with the play call, that’s not the best answer we can give our guys,” Taylor stated on Monday. “That’s 100% on me. Got to give us a better answer. I like the decision to go for it. I think at that point in the game we needed to go for it and be aggressive in the moment. There’s got to be a better call there that I can get us to and so, yeah, 100% on me.” (via: EssentiallySports)With Joe Burrow facing mounting pressure, the Bengals have struggled to score more than 21 points in their last three games, raising concerns for a team of their caliber. If Taylor continues to make these missteps, the Bengals’ hopes for a successful season may be slipping away.Also Read: CJ Stroud’s coach calls out Nick Bosa ‘Weak’ for 49ers star refusing to comment after Donald Trump stunt on TV","Bengals head coach Zac Taylor has come under fire for a critical fourth-down decision that ultimately sealed the team's fate.

MUMBAI: “It’s the last dance, we’ve come to the last dance; they’re dimming the lights down, they’re hoping we’ll go.” No, we are not eulogising Frank Sinatra here. We are dimming the lights, closing our eyes, and wondering whether it is indeed “the last dance” for four Indian stalwarts, at least on home soil, in the whites. Virat Kohli , R Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja and Rohit Sharma have all played their part in making India almost unbeatable at home, till the humble and hard-working Kiwis punctured that aura on Saturday in Pune. Come November 1, as fans walk through Churchgate’s D Road and queue up through the turnstiles at the Wankhede, they would do well to turn up in numbers to acknowledge the contributions of this quartet.The next home Test series is only in October 2025 when the West Indies come calling, and given the form and fitness and age of all four of them — Ashwin is 38, Rohit 37, Kohli will be 36 in a week and Jadeja turns 36 in December — one wonders if all four will still be around by then.India have played 55 Tests at home since England beat them 2-1 in the winter of 2012, with the hosts winning a staggering 42 of them and losing just six. Of those 55, this foursome has played in 22 Tests, featuring in 17 wins. Two of the Tests were drawn while three ended in losses. Ironically, all three losses have come under Rohit’s captaincy.The series loss to New Zealand doesn’t seem like a train-wreck. For some time, Ashwin, Jadeja, Kuldeep or Axar Patel have doubled up as useful lower-order batters, which has masked the failures of the top order. Examples: in Bengaluru vs Sri Lanka, 2022; in Kanpur vs New Zealand 2021; in Chattogram and Mirpur vs Bangladesh, 2022; in Delhi vs Australia in 2023; in Ranchi vs England, 2024.Virat Kohli averages 28.3 vs spin in Asia since 2020. The two dismissals in Pune to Mitch Santner suggested that he had a problem perceiving length. Since the start of this decade, Kohli has played 33 Tests and has scored just 1833 runs at an average of 32.73. Five ducks and eight single digit scores in that period makes for grim reading. His once illustrious colleagues in the batting order, who too were part of a golden home run, Cheteshwar Pujara and Ajinkya Rahane, have averaged 32.7 and 32.9 since 2020.The team management chose to move on from them. Rohit Sharma averages 36.2 vs spin in Asia and has seemingly discarded the qualities that made him such a dependable Test batter, especially on that 2021 tour of England where he wasn’t averse to batting time. Now, his game is all about charging at the bowler, which has often seen him losing shape or getting turned around against seam, like it happened against Tim Southee.Since India got knocked out of the T20 World Cup in Adelaide vs England in 2022 and Rohit stressed on batting with intent, he has carried that kamikaze attitude into the Test format too. Of the 32 times he has batted in Tests post Adelaide, he has faced 50 balls or more only 12 times. And when the captain bats in such cavalier fashion, it often compels others to adopt that approach even if it does not suit their game.Ashwin had a forgettable Test in Bengaluru, despite getting more turn than the Kiwi spinners, but he missed his lengths with alarming consistency, allowing Rachin Ravindra and Southee to attack him. Ashwin is yet to miss a home Test since his debut, a remarkable feat considering how much workload he has had to endure. His spells against Australia in the 2017 Border Gavaskar Trophy, while battling sports hernia, are etched in memory, but that was an Ashwin who was seven and a half years younger.Opposition teams are now finding run-scoring against Ashwin easier. The ease with which he was swept and reverse swept would rankle him and his supporters. His career economy rate is 2.83 after 104 Tests, which is surreal. But this year, Bangladesh scored at 3.31 against him. England, adopting Bazball, scored at 4.12, while New Zealand scored at 3.89. When attacked, he has usually bowled faster and flatter, which is a deviation from the champion offie’s style and strength.Ravindra Jadeja’s best spell of the series came on the third day of the Pune Test where he took a cue from Santner and bowled slower and was rewarded. He too has picked up injuries more regularly lately. Of the 55 home Tests since 2013, he has played in 47 of them and missed just eight, six of them post 2021. And with a growing interest in politics and racehorses, one wonders how much longer one will see him toil away.Jadeja’s strength was his nagging accuracy. A bowling average of 20.85 with a combination of a strikerate of 51.3 and an economy rate of 2.43 in those 47 Tests is a freakish testament to that. But this year, at home, he has gone for 3.30. Bangladesh scored at 3.27 against him, England at 3.24, while New Zealand have prospered scoring at 3.44. He has been cut more regularly this year and every time he has responded with a dart at almost 95 kmph.At their pomp, a long on and long off or deep point was a laughable idea. That Rohit Sharma employed them early on in their spells, was an acknowledgement from the skipper that his spin twins’ powers are probably on the wane. Fifteen minutes into session two of Day One of the second Test in Pune, as Rachin Ravindra and Devon Conway were milking Ashwin and Jadeja, Rishabh Pant yelled into the stump mike, “Chalo bhaiyon, body language uthana padega.”For ears that were used to hearing “bowled, Ash” or “bowled, Jaddu bhai,”, it was a harsh reality check.","India have played 55 Tests at home since England beat them 2-1 in the winter of 2012, with the hosts winning a staggering 42 of them and losing just six. Since the start of this decade, Virat Kohli has played 33 Tests and has scored just 1833 runs at an average of 32.73.

'No addition to the squad'

MUMBAI: Under fire after some uncharacteristically poor performances in the ongoing Test series against New Zealand at home, India's Test captain Rohit Sharma and former captain Virat Kohli received a solid vote of confidence from the team's assistant coach Abhishek Nayar , a couple of days before the third Test at the Wankhede Stadium kicks off on Friday.In the twilight of their illustrious careers, both Rohit and Kohli are facing flak for their batting failures, with their slump being seen as a major reason why India are currently trailing 2-0, reducing the Mumbai Test to a dead rubber.Rohit, whose sequence of scores in this horror series for India reads: 2, 52, 0 & 8, has put together just 62 runs in two Tests@15.50, while Kohli has managed to score just 88 runs @ 22.00, his scores being 0, 70, 1 & 17).However, Nayar said that he had seen ""nothing but love for them (Rohit & Kohli) all over."" Backing the out-of-form duo, Nayar urged for patience when it came to both, saying that they must be given ""space and time to come back.""""I've seen nothing but love for them all over. When a top player, who's been through the journey, goes through a lull, a lot of times it's about giving them their space and trusting that they will come back. They will put in the work. Everyone's worked really hard, everyone wants to do well, whether you're Virat Kohli or Rohit Sharma or even someone as young as Shubman Gill . The effort is there,"" Nayar said at the Wankhede Stadium on Wednesday.""The approach is great. I feel they're putting in the hard yards. Sometimes, sometimes you've got to be a little patient, even with the greatest of players, and they can have tough times. I'm pretty sure sooner rather than later, we'll have more to praise about Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma and everyone else,"" Nayar said.Meanwhile, scoffing all speculation that Delhi pacer Harshit Rana , who has been called up to bowl in the India nets here, could make his debut in the Wankhede Test, Nayar clarified that there were no additions to the India's squad for the third Test.","India's assistant coach Abhishek Nayar backs Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli.

MUMBAI: Will India's cricket stars Rishabh Pant and Shreyas Iyer, who have captained the Delhi Capitals and Kolkata Knight Riders in the past few years, be available at next month's IPL auction, along with KL Rahul , who led the Lucknow Super Giants till last season? The suspense will lift at 5.30pm when all 10 franchises announce their retentions today.Struggling to cope up with India's maiden Test series defeat to New Zealand, the retentions will also serve as a distraction for India's passionate fans. While Rahul is a certainty in the auction as of now, there are indications that Pant and Iyer too could go into the auction pool, but things could well swing at the last minute.""Except the big guns - the Mumbai Indians and the Chennai Super Kings , expect a lot of other franchises to save their money for the likes of Pant, Iyer (who led KKR to the IPL title last season) and Rahul, who could all be available in the IPL auction. Rahul, who captained LSG for three seasons, taking them to the playoffs twice, could be a hot buy, especially as he offers captaincy skills.""There are four franchises who have expressed their interest in him - Royal Challengers Bengaluru, Gujarat Titans, Rajasthan Royals and Chennai Super Kings. Expect all four to go hard for him in the auction,"" a source told TOI.TOI looks at what the 10 franchises are likely to do in terms of retentions on Thursday:According to a reliable source, they are set to retain skipper Ruturaj Gaikwad (Rs 18 crore), Sri Lankan pacer Matheesha Pathirana (Rs 14 crore), Mumbai big hitter Shivam Dube (Rs 11 crore), Ravindra Jadeja (Rs 18 crore) and the legendary MS Dhoni (Rs 4 crore), who will be treated as an uncapped player as he last played for India in the 2019 ODI World Cup. ""They are extremely keen to retain Pathirana, who is likely to play for them in the other T20 leagues too. They will try their best to retain Mumbai seamer Tushar Deshpande, who has done well for them in the past three years, through the RTM (right to match) card,"" a source told TOI.""They might also try the RTM card to get one among New Zealand duo Devon Conway and allrounder Rachin Ravindra. Conway has an edge because he can keep wickets too,"" revealed the source.According to sources, the Mumbai Indians have managed to retain all their India superstars in the lineup - allrounder Hardik Pandya , who captained them in the last season, India skipper Rohit Sharma, India's T20 captain Suryakumar Yadav , ace pacer Jasprit Bumrah and batsman Tilak Varma, which means that they are likely to spend around Rs 75 crore just on retaining their top players.The final word on who will be the MI captain for IPL-2025 is still not decided.Yashasvi Jaiswal is set to be the first player they will retain, at Rs 18 crore. Skipper Sanju Samson, who recently scored his maiden T20I century against Bangladesh (Rs 14 crore), allrounder Riyan Parag (Rs 11 crore) should be their other retentions. They are keen to retain India leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal, who has done well for them previously in the IPL, and in county cricket recently, but it's reliably learnt that they haven't locked him in yet.Even as they parted ways with their previous captain KL Rahul, the Lucknow Super Giants are set to announce West Indies' explosive batter - wicketkeeper Nicholas Pooran as their primary retention at a salary of over Rs 18 crore, the price slab decided by the BCCI, for the No. 1 retention. As per a source, the only other player they are likely to retain is express pacer Mayank Yadav, who made his debut against Bangladesh at home in the T20Is.Their likely retentions could be skipper Shubman Gill , Afghanistan's ace leg-spinner Rashid Khan, Sai Sudharsan, and Rahul Tewatia (uncapped). They could let go of India's ace pacer Mohammed Shami, who is currently out due to injury.There is a buzz that they could reinstate Virat Kohli as their captain. Other than him, the only other player they may choose to retain is middle-order batter Rajat Patidar, who smashed 159 off just 102 balls for Madhya Pradesh against Haryana in the Ranji Trophy recently and did well for them in the last IPL.Their first retained player is set to be South Africa power-hitter Heinrich Klaasen, who is set to get as much as Rs 23 crore. The franchise's other retention deals are Australia's Test and ODI captain Pat Cummins, who was Sunrisers captain in 2024, at Rs 18 crore, India's T20 opener Abhishek Sharma at Rs 14 crore, and allrounder Nitish Kumar Reddy.While Pant's future at the franchise is uncertain, they are set to retain Axar Patel (Rs 18 crore), chinaman bowler Kuldeep Yadav (Rs 14 crore) and wicketkeeper-batter Abhishek Porel (uncapped, Rs 4 crore). They could retain both their foreign big hitters, South Africa's Tristan Stubbs, and Australia's opener Jake Fraser-McGurk.They will try their best to retain India's left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh, even if it means using the RTM card in the auction. ""Arshdeep is someone in whom they have invested a fair bit in, and now he's a top pacer in white-ball cricket. However, they may find it difficult to retain him at a steep price. They are keen to retain two out of the four impressive, uncapped players they have in their line-up, left-arm spinner Harpreet Brar, Shashank Singh, Ashutosh Sharma and 'keeper-bat Prabhsimran Singh,"" a source told this paper.They could let go of not just Iyer, who led them to the IPL title in 2024, but also Sunil Narine and Andre Russell. Their first retained player is set to be mystery spinner Varun Chakravarthy, who has been taking plenty of wickets for them in the last few seasons.'Finisher' Rinku Singh, talented pace bowling allrounder Harshit Rana (uncapped), who has been picked for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy next month, and aggressive English opener Phil Salt could be their other retentions.",IPL teams set to announce retentions today in lead-up to auction. Rishabh Pant and Shreyas Iyer could be available at next month's IPL auction. MS Dhoni will be treated as an uncapped player as he last played for India in the 2019 ODI World Cup.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114798504,imgsize-91346,width-400,resizemode-4/114798504.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Nicholas Pooran could become one of the highest paid retained players in the history of the IPL, TOI has learnt. Lucknow Super Giants and Pooran have reached an agreement where the hard-hitting Trinidadian could end up getting over Rs 20 crore from the franchise, according to IPL sources.""There is a buzz in IPL circles that LSG have agreed to pay Pooran over Rs 20 crore to retain him ahead of the mega auction. The agreement between the two parties was reached in two minutes after consultation with mentor Zaheer Khan and coach Justin Langer ,"" IPL sources said.However, this agreement is no indication of captaincy. The franchise will wait for the auction to see what resources they have. LSG are keen on going all out for Rishabh Pant if DC don't retain him, it is learnt.TOI had reported on October 23 that Pooran was going to be LSG's top retention followed by Mayank Yadav and Ravi Bishnoi. LSG are expected to spend around Rs 50 crore on the retentions.""There is a chance that Lucknow will spend Rs 40 crore on retaining overseas and capped players like Pooran, Mayank and Bishnoi. Uncapped players like Ayush Badoni and Mohsin Khan will be paid as per understanding with the players and the franchise,"" sources said.In the mini IPL auction last year, Mitchell Starc became the most expensive player when KKR paid Rs 24.75 crore. However, no player has been ever retained for an amount of Rs 20 crore.","Nicholas Pooran could become one of the highest paid retained players in the history of the IPL, TOI has learnt.

I was desperate for India A call... dream is to play for the country: Baba Indrajith,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/baba-indrajith-exclusive-interview-tamil-nadu-india-a-squad-australia/articleshow/114775370.cms,"Baba Indrajith. (PTI Photo)

exclusive conversation with Timesofindia.com

Excerpts:

Baba Indrajith plays a shot during the Ranji Trophy match between Tamil Nadu and Karnataka at M.A. Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai. Image: PTI

Twelve years back, you missed the U-19 World Cup bus and were naturally very dejected. Cut to 2024, you are very close to taking the next step, a very crucial step, in your career, and it's going to happen in Australia too. Was there desperation to get that call after years of consistency with the bat?

Did you approach this season any differently? Duleep Trophy squads were picked by national selectors and good outings would have made the right noise. Did you think about what the future had in store - the A tour... ?

And when it finally happened, did it feel overwhelming? Like you put your feet up and say, boss this has finally happened!

How have your preparations been like for the challenge Down Under?

Even after playing First Class cricket for so long, you don't have a lot of overseas exposure and there have been only few outings in Bangladesh some time back. How much are your picking from your brother Aparajith because he has been to Australia multiple times.

Two of your senior state-mates have been very vocal in their support for you. Both Dinesh Karthik and R Ashwin have been regularly highlighting your efforts in the domestic circuit on social media. How special is it to get their support, and how has it been spending a lot of time with Ashwin during the TNPL?

How's the mood in the house - parents, Aparajith...

You have had some freak injuries in the past but how frustrating was it to get injured during the Duleep Trophy fixture. You have batted with stitches, returned from multiple surgeries but this was very close to the Australia tour...

Some twelve years back, Baba Indrajith was at one of the lowest points of his cricketing career when he wasn't picked for India U-19 squad for the World Cup. He was dejected but very happy for his twin brother Baba Aparajith who made the cut and had a good outing Down Under with the side which won the title.With no U-19 launchpad, Indrajith had no option but to undergo the domestic grind for Tamil Nadu but little would he would have imagined that it would take more than a decade for the next step.Also See: Cricket Live Score Season-after-season, he kept piling on the runs for Tamil Nadu in the middle-order but could never go beyond the Zone side. Multiple A tours happened during this duration but Indrajith's name was constantly missing from the squad sheets.He did get frustrated at times, desperation creeped in to do things differently but one thing remained constant - the runs. After 80 First Class appearances, the sweet reward finally came his way when he was named in India A squad for the tour of Australia Yes, Australia. The same Australia where he wanted to go with India U-19 side as a teenager and 12 years later, he will be donning the shining whites and will take a crucial step towards realising his ultimate dream of playing for the country.In an, Tamil Nadu's run-machine talks about his long journey, the injury fears in Duleep Trophy, the ""different feeling"" in the household and the desperation to get the India A opportunity.Australia has been a special place in our family. Because Apar (Aparajith) travelled to Australia a lot of times and won the World Cup. I would have wanted to be at the U-19 World Cup as well but I never felt like that they should have picked me or something like that. I was very happy for Apar but never thought on these lines. Only when you told me, I was able to recollect all of that.And yes, I think you can say I was desperate. It's not wrong to say I was. I was actually desperate to get this opportunity because being in the domestic circuit for so long, and obviously that expectation of getting the break would be there. Very, very happy that everything happens for a reason and comes at the right time. So I'm happy that it's happened now.Was the opportunity coming up in my mind? Definitely, yeah. But I wanted to focus on the things I could do correctly because if I put too much pressure on myself then it would be very difficult. But at the same time, if I say that, okay, I didn't think about all of these tours or whatever that is coming up, I would be lying. So it was there in the back of the mind. And obviously, whenever I wrote it down and I said, like, if I get my eye in, or if I get set, then I will think of these tours or whatever it is coming up, and then I will push myself to score big. So that was there in my mind. But I wasn't putting too much pressure on myself saying that, okay, this is the thing. I know Duleep Trophy is very very important and I knew if I score runs, I would get an opportunity.You have been at it for more than a decade in the First Class circuit. You play Tamil Nadu Premier League, have been part of IPL teams and there has been continuous cricket. Did it get exhausting at some point? Did you ask questions like - what more is needed, what do I need to do to take that next step...Obviously, I mean, all of these thoughts came in. Because, as you said, the domestic scene is not very easy. It's a very hard toil for so long. So all of these hardships come to you, I mean, come to your mind. So whenever you get the opportunity, or whenever you get the break, that realisation will be even more, because you know how hard you work to get here. So. yeah, in a way, I feel it's a good thing, because when you get an opportunity like this, you know the value of it, yeah.I understand what you're saying, but I mean, like, it hasn't gone to that level. But obviously it was emotional. I will be very honest, it was emotional because, yeah, I've been waiting for this opportunity for a very long time. It was kind of emotional but at the same time, I told myself that, okay, this is just one step ahead because my dream is to play for the country. It is a little bit overwhelming, but not too much, because I don't want it to be too overwhelming. If that happens, then I will be satisfied just getting selected for India, which I don't want. I want to go there and do well. I know there will be a lot of hype. Obviously there will be a lot of expectations.I have done whatever preparation I could do in terms of skill, mentally, physically, whatever it is, because I know the value of this. So I will give everything. And obviously that dream to play for the country and do well for the country is there. So I don't want this to be too overwhelming, yeah, but at the same time, I'm leaving the result to the universe. So I will do everything... whatever I've been doing in the domestic circuit. I will try and do the same thing there.I will somehow get to the same pattern. Obviously, wherever you go, even if it is from Chennai to Delhi or from Chennai to Mumbai, conditions are going to be different, correct? So similarly, when you go to Australia, it's going to be even more different. And you will not crack the code or find the pattern, or even if you play the domestic circuit for so long.With whatever experience I have, I should go there and adapt quickly. So the adaptation is going to be very, very important, yeah. And if I adapt and things go well, God willing, then I would be very happy.I have been picking his (Aparajith) brain. And a lot of other people too because if I can get something out of everybody then I feel it's going to help me. And no better person than Apar because I'll be able to relate to him much better than anybody else. He has gone there thrice, not just once. So it's going to be very helpful.And outside of India, I have played just three games in Bangladesh and that too rain affected. So to be very honest, I have not had exposure outside of India. So as I said, even if it's outside of India, even if it's in the subcontinent or outside the continent, it is going to be different. You are going to take time to adapt, and when it's in Australia, obviously, conditions are going to be even more different. So I don't want to be overwhelmed or be worried about it.I've accepted the fact that it's going to be different. It is better to adapt. That's the one thing I could do from my side, apart from that kind of preparation because you're not going to play a domestic season there for a month or two or for a year and then get used to the conditions. Apart from that, I feel like I can do a lot of visualisation and preparation in terms of watching matches and everything. I've been doing that personally but want to get too much into the details but I've been preparing myself.I think their help has been great... immense. DK, I know him personally for a very long time and he's been supportive and also helpful in my game as well, in terms of preparation and everything, whatever it is, he doesn't hold back. I can call him anytime and then ask for his help, Even before the Duleep Trophy, he told me certain things as to how to practice and go about things, and Ashwin has been an immense help too.There is no need for Ashwin or Dinesh Karthik to put out a tweet or be supportive on social media for me, but they take that extra initiative and step because whenever someone does well, they make sure that it is seen outside. Because you know it's not easy. If they don't put it, nobody's going to ask them why. If they don't show their support, nobody is going to ask... but to take that initiative and be supportive has been very, very helpful.And one thing with Ashwin is that he doesn't make you feel like you're talking to someone who's taken over 500 Test wickets. He comes down to your level and talks. And it's not like he plays in the TNPL for the sake of it. He plays it with intensity and wants you to improve your game all the time. So all of these things, even if it's a different format, it definitely helps.And when you play Ashwin in the net(s) you will definitely get the confidence. So you feel like that if you can play a bowler who has picked 500 Test wickets, you will be able to manage other players. Sometimes you get overwhelmed with the players who you've seen on TV, and then directly go and play with them. Okay, these are like, big bowlers, big players. You feel like that. But when you are able to face the challenge and take the challenge of Ashwin, who has taken 500 Test wickets you will gain a lot of confidence.And if he gives a pat on the back, saying that, okay, you are doing well, then nothing more than that. That confidence is going to be very, very high. And obviously DK has a lot of experience in the IPL, is commentating all around the world, is coaching and everything. So they both have been very, very instrumental.It's a bit different because obviously it's a new challenge for Apar moving to another state and playing as a professional. It's a different challenge and it's different for us also because we are so used to playing for the same team. So it's a bit different. But in the household, I think they're very, very happy for me. Father, mother... because they have seen my struggles for all these years, and they're very, very happy for me, and obviously Apar is also very happy. But it's difficult for my parents also because 10 or 12 years back, the scenario was different. Now the scenario is different.So as parents, you want both your kids to do well. But sometimes it is different. It is different. Difficult for them to handle all of that. But the good thing is that between me and Apar there's always been a good rapport. We have always helped each other become better cricketers. So that has been okay, but overall, right now, everybody is happy for me, and they want me to go there, enjoy myself and do well.To be very honest with you, the minute I fell down, because I knew the Australia tour was coming, I didn't tell anybody, but I was aiming for it. But the minute I fell down, the first thought went to Australia, will I be missing it again? Missing the India opportunity again? So I troubled a lot of my strength and conditioning courses and physios asking, What is the grade? One, what if it's Grade 2? How long will it take? In 10 days, one week and all of that. And I did a lot of research.When you are scared or worried or anxious, you will do all of those things to make sure that you somehow get on the flight to Australia, because it happened on the third game. I thought, okay, I was going to play the Rest of India game, and I will get the opportunity because I got two good scores in Duleep Trophy. And that third game, I was batting on 35 so I thought I have a decent chance to go to Australia.But the minute I fell down all those things... like I was really, really upset. The physical pain was there but mentally I was gone. But I think with a lot of help from the strength and conditioning coaches I did everything possible. I did absolutely everything possible, right from my diet to my sleep time to everything to make sure that I got fit for the first Ranji Trophy game. Because only if I played Ranji, I will be cleared for fitness. So all of these things were running in my mind, and I think, as they say, everything happens for a reason, and I'm happy and thankful that I was able to be fit for the first time.","Baba Indrajith has been named in the India A squad for the tour of Australia.

NEW DELHI: Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola 's recent comments on the historic rivalry between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo have sparked a fresh wave of discussion and debate in the world of football .Speaking at a pre-match press conference on Tuesday, the Spaniard opened up on a long-running rivalry between Messi and Ronaldo.""No one could beat Messi, only Cristiano. Cristiano was a monster and the father of that monster is Messi. The two have achieved something incredible in the last 20 years,"" said Guardiola.Guardiola's remarks came on the back of the 2024 Ballon d'Or ceremony, where Manchester City's Rodri emerged as the winner, breaking the long-standing duopoly of Messi and Ronaldo.The Spanish midfielder's triumph was celebrated as a victory for Spanish football and a recognition of the often-overlooked role of midfielders in the game.Rodri's win marked a significant milestone, as he became the first defensive midfielder to claim the Ballon d'Or since Lothar Matthaus in 1990 and only the third Spaniard to receive the honour, following in the footsteps of Alfredo Di Stefano and Luis Suarez.His win is particularly noteworthy as it ends a long drought for Spanish players in the Ballon d'Or rankings, with no Spaniard having won the award since Luis Suarez in 1960, despite Spain's ""golden generation"" achieving significant success on the international stage.“Maybe Xavi and Iniesta deserved it at that time, so I think yesterday Rodri achieved what Spanish football deserved worldwide,” Guardiola further added.The 2024 Ballon d'Or ceremony was massively dominated by Rodri's compatriots, national teammate Lamine Yamal winning the Kopa Trophy for the best Under-21 player, Aitana Bonmati securing the women's Ballon d'Or for the second consecutive year, and Jennifer Hermoso being honoured with the Socrates Award for her role in the fight for women's rights in football and her courageous stance against sexism in sport.","Guardiola's comments come on the back of the 2024 Ballon d'Or ceremony.

Brief Scores:

AHMEDABAD: Opener and vice-captain Smriti Mandhana (100 off 122 balls; 10x4) answered questions about her form with a timely century as India chased down a 233- run target with six wickets to spare in the third and final ODI against New Zealand here on Tuesday.With meaningful contributions from captain Harmanpreet Kaur (59 not out; 63b; 6x4), No. 3 Yastika Bhatia (35; 49b; 4x4) and finishing touches from Jemimah Rodrigues (22; 18b; 4x4), the hosts chased down the target in 44.2 overs to take the series 2-1.India’s pursuit of 233 commenced with Shafali Verma striking two exquisite boundaries before she was caught down the leg side by Isabella Gaze off pacer Hannah Rowe. However, Mandhana and Bhatia batted in a composed manner, rotating the strike and hitting the odd bad ball for boundaries as India reached 40 for 1 in the first 10 overs.Mandhana’s first boundary came off the 27th delivery she faced while Bhatia got off the mark with a straight drive off Lea Tahuhu. Smriti lofted Eden Carson for a boundary over mid off before Yastika smashed the same bowler over extra cover for another four. Bhatia then hit Sophie Devine straight down the ground before spooning a catch back to the bowler off the next ball.Harmanpreet and Smriti's partnership started off slowly but eventually all the bowlers bore the brunt of their hitting prowess. Devine was struck for three boundaries while left-arm spinner Fran Jonas and pacer Rowe were smashed to all parts of the ground.Smriti was bowled just after she completed her hundred, off Rowe’s scrambled seam delivery. Jemimah's cameo, in which she struck four exquisite boundaries, was cut short by Jonas, who trapped her in front.Earlier, India had New Zealand in a spot of bother, first at 36 for 3 and then again at 88 for 5, but the White Ferns added 144 runs for the last five wickets to reach 232 in 49.5 overs.India 236 for 4 (Mandhana 100, Harmanpreet 59; Rowe 2 for 47) beat New Zealand 232 (Halliday 86, Deepti 3 for 39, Mishra 2 for 41) by 6 wickets.","Opener and vice-captain Smriti Mandhana (100 off 122 balls; 10x4) answered questions about her form with a timely century.

MUMBAI: Soaking in an emotional return to a venue in which he created history three years ago by becoming only the third bowler to claim the 'perfect 10' , New Zealand 's left-arm spinner Ajaz Patel , who hails from Jogeshwari in Mumbai and still has many relatives here, confessed that he didn't even imagine coming back to the Wankhede Stadium to play a Test again.""Being back in Mumbai is always quite special and it's a place I call home as well. Having the opportunity to play out here again is quite special. After my 10-wicket haul, I wasn't sure whether I'd get another opportunity to play here throughout my career,"" the 36-year-old said, sporting a wide smile, during a media interaction at the Wankhede Stadium on Wednesday.While he didn't remember much about the pitch for that Test, in which he took 14-225 (10-119, 4-106) , the tweaker did say that the pitch for the upcoming Test, which will start on Friday, looked different from the one on December 2021. ""My memory is very poor, so I don't exactly remember the surface that well but one thing I do remember was it looked a lot drier to start with,"" he said.How much fortunes change for cricketers with every tour can be gauged from the fact that this time, the spotlight is also on Patel's fellow left-arm spinner Mitchell Santner , who destroyed India in the Pune Test on a turning track with sensational match figures of 13 for 157 (7-53 & 6-104). Patel said that he was just happy to play second fiddle to Santner, while exerting pressure on India from the other end.""It's about looking at what roles you're playing for the team. Mitch (Santner) was bowling exceptionally well from the other end so for me it was important that from my end while I'm still trying to take wickets, I'm also performing the holding role and trying to restrict the flow of runs. The way Mitch was bowling, there was no real need for me to try too many things. It was about trying to keep it as simple as possible. Going into a new surface and a new game that may completely flip,"" he said.","New Zealand spinner Ajaz Patel returns to Wankhede Stadium for first time in three years.

India A's tour of Australia got off to a horrendous start in Mackay on Thursday, when the two uncapped players picked for the Border Gavaskar Trophy -- Abhimanyu Easwaran and Nitish Kumar Reddy -- failed to impress on the first morning of their four-day match against Australia A at the Great Barrier Reef Arena.Australia A won the toss and opted to bowl, and right-arm fast bowler Jordan Buckingham sent openers Easwaran and Ruturaj Gaikwad back in the pavilion for 7 and a golden duck respectively, before his fellow pacer Brendan Doggett tore open the Indian line-up with a five-wicket spell.Easwaran has been picked as a back-up opener for the five-Test series against Australia beginning in Perth on November 22.Sai Sudharsan (21) looked to have got his eye in but Doggett ended his stay, before also accounting for Ishan Kishan (9) who is trying to impress the BCCI selectors to make his way back into the Indian team.While Devdutt Padikkal was looking solid at one end, he saw Baba Indrajith (9) falling to Australia's Test off-spinner Todd Murphy before Kishan came in.The match is also a screen-test for all-rounder Nitish Kumar Reddy who is among the all-rounders picked for the Border Gavaskar Trophy, but he too had a forgettable outing -- dismissed for a six-ball duck by Doggett.The fall of Padikkal (36) made it 78 for 6. It was Doggett's fourth wicket of the day. The paceman soon made it five when he struck Manav Suthar (1) in front.At the time this report was published, India A were reeling at 86 for 8.",India A's tour of Australia got off to a horrendous start in Mackay on Thursday.

Indian captain Rohit Sharma has seen a dramatic decline in his ICC Test batting ranking, dropping to his lowest position since December 2018 in the latest ICC update on Wednesday.This update brought notable changes across the rankings, with one of the most striking shifts being Sharma's nine-place drop from 15th to 24th, according to Wisden.This marks his lowest ranking in nearly six years. Previously, he had fallen to 44th after scoring 63 not out and 5 against Australia in Melbourne in December 2018.Sharma's form saw a significant boost following his twin centuries (176 and 127) against South Africa in October 2019, elevating him to 17th in the rankings.

His recent poor performances in home matches against Bangladesh and New Zealand have contributed to this decline. In the Bengaluru Test against New Zealand, he managed scores of only 2 and 52, followed by 0 and 8 in Pune, leading to India's first home Test series defeat in 12 years.Other Indian players also experienced ranking drops.

East Bengal FC ended their winless run of the season in style, blowing away Bangladesh champions Bashundhara Kings 4-0 in their second Group A match of the inaugural AFC Challenge League in Thimphu on Tuesday.Oscar Bruzon’s side, with its back to the wall, finally came to the fore with a statement win, with Dimitri Diamantakos opening the floodgates in just 35 seconds — the club’s quickest goal in international football .Goals from Souvik Chakrabarti (20), Nandhakumar Sekar (26) and Anwar Ali (33) helped East Bengal kill the game as a contest in the first half itself. It was East Bengal’s first win since beating Downtown Heroes in the Durand Cup on August 7, during which period they have lost 8 matches in a row before sharing the spoils 2-2 with Bhutanese side Paro FC in the Challenge League opener.East Bengal got off to a rampaging start, and the way they stormed the Bashundhara area with so much magic and menace that the Bangladesh champions didn’t have an answer to it.Diamantakos started the rout, turning in Lalchungnunga’s low centre across the face of the goal with his left foot. Bruzon’s strategy of pressing the opponents high on the pitch and then finding an attacker with pinpoint and purposeful crosses often bypassing the middle third while Nandhakumar posing a constant threat with his pace and potency along the left flank — kept bearing fruit with almost every move in the first half.In the 20th minute, Naorem Mahesh blew Nandhakumar’s cutback over the bar, but when they came calling again barely a few seconds later, they found an unlikely scorer in Souvik. Bashundhara captain Topu Barman managed to deal with a Saul Crespo attempt, but the East Bengal No. 23 found the back of the net with his left-footed snap shot from the edge of the box.Six minutes later, it became 3-0.Nandhakumar, receiving the ball from Talal, entered the box with his trademark pacey run, took rival defender Raiman Kazi in his stride with a swift outside dodge and drilled the ball into the far corner past goalkeeper Anisur Rahman.There was no let-up in East Bengal’s attacking intensity and Anwar joined the party with a spectacular left-footed strike from near the D. Bashundhara did trouble East Bengal on a few occasions with goalkeeper Prabhsukhan effecting a couple of saves to deny Foysal Fahim while Jonathan Reis had his shot denied by the woodwork.East Bengal too could have swelled their tally had second-half substitutions Cleiton Silva and David Hmar been on target with their shots.East Bengal with 4 points are second in the group and will take on leaders Nejmeh FC of Lebanon, who have won both their matches.

Vinicius Jr. has pledged to continue his fight against racism despite believing it impacted his chances of winning the Ballon d'Or . As per Reuters, the Real Madrid forward's camp revealed his commitment to combating racism after he finished second in the award voting behind Rodri Vinicius expressed his determination to continue to go after racist fans through a post on social media, where he wrote: ""I will do it 10x if I have to. They're not ready,"" following Real Madrid’s decision to boycott the Paris ceremony anticipating that he would not win.His management confirmed that this message relates to his anti-racism efforts. They believe these efforts might have influenced the outcome, stating, ""the football world is not ready to accept a player who fights against the system.""Vinicius has faced racial abuse multiple times in Spain, leading to at least two convictions for racist comments.

You need to get to a situation for luck to play a role: Arjun Kadhe,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/you-need-to-get-to-a-situation-for-luck-to-play-a-role-arjun-kadhe/articleshow/114661630.cms,"Arjun Kadhe

PUNE: It was his grandparents who sowed the seeds for Arjun Kadhe ’s career as a professional tennis player.More than two decades ago, when Arjun was taking baby steps in tennis, his paternal grandfather decided to sell their house and set aside the proceeds exclusively to help his grandson follow a dream.“I remember when I was eight years old … at that point we were not financially so super to think about tennis as a viable option for my career. But my granddad had a vision. He told me, ‘Okay, I will do anything. You just play tennis, you want to represent India, you want to play a Grand Slam ’. My parents were living on rent. It was unbelievable,” an emotional Kadhe, 30, said as he jogged his memory back.All the sacrifices, of his and of those around him, and the years of tireless pursuit of excellence bore fruit last week when Arjun claimed his first ATP Tour doubles title , in partnership with Rithvik Choudary at the Almaty Open in Kazakhstan last week.“The credit goes first to my parents, they've made huge sacrifices, then my coaches. Obviously, it's a team effort,” he said.""Obviously, Balu sir (coach M Balachandran) traveling with us, (former South African player) Raven (Klaasen) traveling with us, the Double Dream of India programme is helping us a lot.“And as you said, the journey is long, but it feels really, really good, because you get rewarded. In doubles you're playing 35 weeks alone on the road, and it can be really brutal sometimes.“So this win, we both want to take it in, get confidence, enjoy and go ahead again.”The Indian combination beat three teams ranked in the top-30 on the ATP Tour, including No. 13 pair Sadio Doumbia and Fabien Reboul of France in the second round.In a thriller of a final, Arjun and Rithvik saved five match points in the super tiebreak to beat Germany’s Jakob Schnaitter and Mark Wallner, ranked 26th, 3-6, 7-6 (3), 14-12. Remarkably, the Indians won only 68 points to their rivals’ 80 in the match.Arjun acknowledged that luck played its part in their win, but the team needed to work hard to get there in the first place.“I think luck played a big part. But at the same time, we were just talking, the coaches were telling us we lost two finals in the super tiebreak, where we were the better team, in the Challengers. As (personal coach) Hemant (Bendrey) sir was also saying, luck is there, but you have to get yourself into that situation for luck to play it out,” Arjun said.The Punekar, supported by Punit Balan group , rose to a career-high 77 in the individual doubles ranking after the win.“I'm really grateful that it has happened, but at the same time, I feel I was playing a good level,” he said.“It's about, you know, being there, giving yourself that chance, getting rejected, at some point it will come.“It's not in your hands when that click comes. For some people, it comes early. If they can sustain it, they move to the next level.“Some people get rejected, and get that breakthrough. It's about working hard and trying to improve, and take the next step. Everyone has their own journey, in my opinion.“I feel we deserve it, because I truly believe we have the level. Now it's about going the long way and trying to improve every day and not be satisfied with this one tournament.”Arjun had partnered Rithvik in the latter half of last season but parted ways at the start of 2024. Even before they combined, the Telangana lad had mentioned to Arjun of his desire to play with his previous partner Niki Poonacha whenever he decided to focus on doubles. So, the Maharashtra player was understandably cautious when Rithvik reached out to him in the middle of this season.“I feel like every challenge brings opportunity. At that point (when Rithvik chose to go back to Niki at the start of 2024), I was like, ‘oh my God. we are doing well, blah, blah, blah, what is happening?’ But then, if I look back now, I won (two Challenger) titles (with Jeevan Nedunchezhiyan and Anirudh Chandrasekar),” Arjun said.“So it was really good for me.”This time around, Arjun said, the two were in for the long haul. And long-term partnership is something he strongly believes in.“To develop a good team, you need time,” he said, “because if you keep switching partners, the first few weeks of understanding how we want to play, understanding how my partner wants us to play in the future, what is our best?“For all that to align it takes a little bit of time, and in doubles you have super tiebreak. Sometimes you are winning from (facing) match points, sometimes losing from match points.”The Almaty title had given a pleasant surprise for both Arjun and Rithvik in terms of ranking jump — the latter had broken into the top-100 for the first time in his career, reaching 85 in the ATP charts.That means they will now give it a shot to make the Australian Open cut before closing the season.“Now it's about planning it smartly, taking care of your body, because it's the end of the year, you don't want to overplay,” he said.“If we want to be top-50 in the world, we need to improve a lot. We won this tournament, but those teams are doing so many things better than us. So, it’s important also to play the big events, lose, and then realize this is where we are at.“So, we are not thinking too far ahead, just trying to think next week. How can we try and make Australia? If we don't make it, we still have to try and make French.“The plan will go forward from there.”","Arjun Kadhe claims his first ATP Tour doubles title with Rithvik Choudary at Almaty Open in Kazakhstan. The 30-year-old rose to a career-high 77 in the individual doubles ranking after the win. Arjun acknowledged that luck played its part in their win, but the team needed to work hard.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114661721,imgsize-157286,width-400,resizemode-4/114661721.jpg"
My fighting spirit helped me win my first ITF title: Tanisha Kashyap,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/my-fighting-spirit-helped-me-win-my-first-itf-title-tanisha-kashyap/articleshow/114554193.cms,"Tanisha Kashyap in action during the $15,000 ITF women's tennis event in Bengaluru last week. (Photo Credit: KSLTA/Deepthi Indukuri)

For Tanisha Kashyap , 22, the $15,000 ITF title in Bengaluru last week will remain special for many reasons, not least because it's her first one on the pro circuit.""This one's really special because it's in my home country, in India, and it's something that I've waited for a while,"" Tanisha said.""I'm really glad how I performed in the week I was actually injured. I had a neck catch which led to my shoulders because of the continuous matches that I played.""And it was tough each and every match to play with that pain, but I managed it really well. Mentally, I stayed strong and I relied on my fitness to win this title.""Tanisha, world ranked 868, overcame Akanksha Nitture 6-7 (5), 6-1, 6-1 in the final of the hard court event.The triumph was made all the more memorable by the difficult start to the season wherein she was rendered out of action for three months after undergoing a ""mini surgery"" to treat a meniscus and ACL tear.Tanisha suffered the injury during an event in Monastir, Tunisia, in early April. She was leading in the second set against Finland'sAnastasia Kulikova , a former top-200 player with nine pro titles, when she felt pain but played through it. It was only the following day when she underwent scan, she discovered the full extent of the injury.""I cannot disclose what treatment I got, because I was treated by (Daniil) Medvedev's doctor … (I was) set back for three to four weeks,"" she said.""I was completely off from tennis. I was on crutches. I didn't play for three-four (sic) months. I was just building back my fitness and building the strength of my knee and everything.""So I would say this year has been tough, mentally, physically, and I had to face a lot adversities in the beginning because it was not looking that great.""But through it all, I stayed positive and didn't lose sight of my goal. I worked hard each and every day to build myself back up from injury … to get to where I'm right now, to lift my first pro title.""The time away from action and the subsequent comeback helped her understand her game better.""When I did start, it was also very tough, because when you start to play tournaments, you're trying to figure it out again because there's some pain or there's a certain movement that's bothering you.""So you have to find out, you have to go back and do therapy. It was a process to figure it out and to also strengthen my quads back up to support my knee. So, it was tough.""But, sometimes when there's a lot of chaos, when you have a lot of time, you can really think about tennis from an outside perspective, and you get to know yourself better.""Tunisia seems to be Tanisha's favourite hunting ground, at least this year, and it was for a reason.""The best probable reason why I frequently played in Monastir (is) because I've been boarding in All In Tennis Academy (in France), and it's very close,"" she said.""It's not that expensive to travel, not much of jet lag. And the level of the tournaments in Monastir are way, way, much higher than other places.""And I was still fresh off an injury. If you're injured and suddenly go to Thailand, what do you do? You go to Indonesia, you spend all that money for two weeks and you might not perform well.""It was in Monastir while she was finding her way back in July that she first felt a catch in the neck, which forced her to retire from a $15K event in the second round when she was leading 6-2, 4-1 against Spaniard Victoria Gomez O'Hayon.It was the same issue that cropped up in Bengaluru at the very start of the tournament, and she showed tremendous grit to play through the pain and obvious discomfort it put her in.""Right before my first round, in a certain movement, I jerked it, and I had the same neck catch again,"" she said.""I couldn't look up, I couldn't look to my right, I couldn't serve. And I think throughout this tournament, I had so many double faults. I'm sure the statistics are there.""It taught me something. I stayed strong, I battled each and every point. I ran for each and every shot. I didn't, you know, let anything go. So, that fighting spirit really helped me win this tournament.""And, of course, some strategy here and there, and to play smart tennis.""Smart tennis she did have to play in the final which lasted two hours and 19 minutes.""I knew that I had limited range of motion, and I knew that I couldn't blast my first serves, how I was blasting in Mysuru or before. So I knew that I had to tennis wise, play smart, and place the ball and start off the point and stay in the rallies for my match.""For sure, the neck started to act during the first set, which lasted more than an hour and a half. She delivered nine double faults in the opener, compared to just one for the remainder of the match.""When I was four or five down, my neck started to really catch again, and it was really extremely painful. So I had no other option to call the physio,"" Tanisha said.""The second and third, I took a breather. I just kind of meditated and focused on my game strategy … to place the balls away from her striking zone and to make her work for each and every point.And maybe she wasn't expecting, maybe she thought that I would be tired out and I wouldn't fight back. But I've always been a fighter, and I stayed strong mentally and just stayed in it, and I let her make the errors.""I was calm and cool. I can't explain it, but you know, I just went into my zone.""Tanisha has been mainly coached by her father Suresh Kalita. But she had worked with former Davis Cupper Vishaal Uppal and Billie Jean King Cup player Rushmi Chakravarthi among other coaches. She also had a short stint at the JC Ferrero Tennis Academy in Spain before heading to the Ohio State University to play college tennis.Having seen her share of tennis abroad, the Assam native believes that while the ""commitment level and fitness level"" were the areas where Indian players lagged, it was not necessary that they had to relocate to elsewhere to make the breakthrough.""We can definitely do that here as well. Like I said, it depends on the individual and how much they want to do it.""They might be doing the same exercises that the Europeans are doing, but it's not up to the standard that the Europeans are doing. In the sense, the effort, the physical ability, how much you are pushing yourself.""I've always believed that it's an individual's choice. And, there are some great tennis coaches, fitness coaches here. But in the end of the day, it's how hard you push yourself.""As for herself, Tanisha is not ready to rest on her Bengaluru laurels.""""This is just the beginning of something,"" she said, ""it's a good achievement, but I'm looking for more. I'm gonna get back to train and recover, to win some more, hopefully soon.""It's just one of the small stepping stones towards the bigger picture and the bigger goal.""","Tanisha Kashyap, 22, won the $15,000 ITF title in Bengaluru last week.
