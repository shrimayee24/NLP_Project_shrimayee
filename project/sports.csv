Taylor Swift‚Äôs quiet date night with Travis Kelce in Palm Beach sparks concern amid Blake Lively drama

Travis Kelce trains hard while Taylor Swift seeks peace of mind

P op superstar Taylor Swift and NFL tight end Travis Kelce were spotted together on a subdued date night in Palm Beach, Florida, drawing both fan admiration and media speculation. The couple, usually vibrant and playful in public, appeared noticeably restrained as they exited Harry‚Äôs restaurant late Friday evening, marking one of their few public sightings this year.Observers noted Taylor Swift looked ‚Äúa little down,‚Äù a contrast to her usual radiant demeanor. While she eventually relaxed over dinner‚Äîreportedly enjoying a glass of white wine and smiling while placing her order‚Äîthe somber mood raised eyebrows. It‚Äôs a shift that many believe stems from recent personal upheaval involving longtime friend Blake Lively and actor Justin Baldoni.The typically private Swift was drawn into an unexpected legal conflict between Lively and Baldoni, a dispute that reportedly threatened to expose personal messages between the singer and the Gossip Girl actress. A subpoena issued earlier this month demanded Swift‚Äôs involvement, but it has since been withdrawn.Despite the legal resolution, the emotional strain seems to linger.According to reports, Baldoni‚Äôs legal team claimed that Lively had ""pressured Swift to publicly side with her,"" potentially putting their friendship‚Äîand Swift‚Äôs reputation‚Äîon the line. The singer, known for her meticulous control over her public image, remained silent throughout the ordeal, avoiding public comment and any legal entanglements that could compromise her privacy.While Swift takes time off from touring to recover emotionally and mentally, Kelce is taking a different approach to the offseason. The Kansas City Chiefs star has been laser-focused on fitness, reportedly shedding 25 pounds and undergoing grueling training sessions in Miami ahead of the team‚Äôs May 27 activities.‚ÄúTravis Kelce confidently shows off his hairy back during an intense offseason workout session,‚Äù a headline teased, showcasing his transformation and commitment to a stronger 2025 season.

Auston Matthews and his fans got emotional as his mother opened up about the financial struggles of getting him into hockey,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/auston-matthews-and-his-fans-got-emotional-as-his-mother-opened-up-about-the-financial-struggles-of-getting-him-into-hockey/articleshow/121166477.cms,"Image credit - Paige Taylor White/CP

Auston Matthews‚Äô hockey dream wasn‚Äôt cheap and his mom took the weight

‚ÄúI used to work in the morning for Starbucks, in the afternoon the restaurant, i was very fortunate to have two jobs. And believe me, if they would have more hours, I would have more jobs.""

Before Auston Matthews was an NHL superstar, his biggest supporter was clocking into two jobs, trying to make ends meet. His mom, Ema Matthews, didn‚Äôt just believe in his dream, she bankrolled it, penny by penny, from behind a Starbucks counter. For families without deep pockets, hockey can be financially brutal. But Ema‚Äôs resilience turned obstacles into opportunity and her son into one of the league‚Äôs brightest stars. Her story is the heartwarming reminder that every great athlete often has a real-life superhero cheering from the sidelines, sacrificing, hustling, and holding it all together so their child can chase the impossible.Ice time, gear, coaching, travel, youth hockey isn‚Äôt just a sport, it‚Äôs a financial beast. For the Matthews family, especially with Ema being originally from Hermosillo, Mexico, the culture and cost of the sport were both daunting. But she took on the challenge without hesitation, picking up multiple jobs including a gig at Starbucks to ensure Auston never missed a chance to grow on the ice.Ema shared in a past interview that the cost of hockey often reached up to $20,000 a year, a heavy ask for any middle-class family. To make it work, she didn‚Äôt just cut corners, she picked up shifts and poured lattes while helping Auston stay focused on the sport. She even deposited small amounts of money in his account so he could grab food with teammates like a regular teen. Beyond that, Ema often drove long hours to tournaments, handled equipment costs, and juggled bills, all to ensure Auston had every chance to chase his dreams without added stress.Ema‚Äôs story also breaks stereotypes. In a sport dominated by players from Canada and northern U.S. states, Auston‚Äôs rise as a player of Mexican heritage makes his success even more impactful. It's not just about talent, it‚Äôs about trailblazing, especially for kids of color or immigrant families who rarely see themselves represented in hockey.Auston Matthews is one of the Toronto Maple Leafs‚Äô biggest stars and a face of the NHL. He‚Äôs not just known for his goal-scoring skills but also for his poise and work ethic, traits his mom likely helped instill. While fans celebrate his success on the ice, stories like Ema‚Äôs remind us of the sacrifices behind the scenes that made it possible.Ema Matthews‚Äô story shows what‚Äôs possible when love, grit, and hustle lead the way. Ema Matthews' unwavering dedication turned sacrifice into success, fueling Auston‚Äôs NHL dreams.

Tom Brady may be retired from the NFL, but the seven-time Super Bowl champion is far from done with football. Just months after becoming a part-owner of the Las Vegas Raiders, new reports suggest Brady is eyeing a second ownership opportunity‚Äîthis time much closer to his Florida home.According to Mark Perry of UFL News Hub, the United Football League (UFL) is considering expansion teams in Oakland, Philadelphia, New Jersey, and Tampa Bay. While Tampa might seem like an odd choice‚Äîgiven the underwhelming past performance of the Bay Vipers in both the USFL and XFL‚Äîthere‚Äôs a key reason it could be revived: Brady.""This location surprised me as it did not do well in the USFL reboot or the XFL under the (Tampa) Bay Vipers,"" Perry wrote. ""However, I have heard from sources that NFL legend Tom Brady is interested in purchasing a UFL team. I did not believe that rumor until I saw this. Brady lives in the Tampa area. The only reason to bring the Bandits back, based on locations run in the XFL and USFL, is if they had an owner in place.""Brady‚Äôs involvement would be a game-changer not only for the potential Tampa Bay franchise but for the entire UFL. His iconic status and proven football acumen could instantly boost credibility and attract fans, sponsors, and talent to the still-growing league.Unlike the NFL, where ownership rules are strict and Brady‚Äôs Raiders role has limited visibility‚Äîespecially since he doesn't live in Las Vegas‚Äîthe UFL offers a more flexible landscape. This could give Brady the creative freedom to influence everything from branding to football operations.It‚Äôs also a strategic move: owning a UFL team in Tampa puts him near his residence and reestablishes a professional football presence in a market still rich with fan interest post-retirement.While nothing is confirmed yet, the mere possibility of Brady fronting a UFL expansion team is already generating buzz. His name carries immense weight, and if he does move forward with Tampa Bay ownership, it would mark a bold and calculated step in shaping the sport beyond the NFL.Also Read: Tom Brady fires back with classic wit after Ryan Reynolds jokingly begs for a jersey and a hair strand With expansion talks heating up, all eyes are on Brady once again‚Äînot for a comeback on the field, but for a new legacy in football ownership.","The United Football League (UFL) is considering expansion teams in Oakland, Philadelphia, New Jersey, and Tampa Bay.

After falling short in the playoffs yet again‚Äîthis time against the Indiana Pacers ‚Äîthe front office must decide: Isworth his max contract, or would the team be better off reinvesting in a more cost-effective option likeQuestions about roster construction have reached a boiling point, with critics pointing to the Knicks‚Äô inability to optimize Towns alongside Jalen Brunson and Julius Randle. Meanwhile, Robinson‚Äôs impact off the bench has only muddied the waters, proving that sometimes the flashiest move isn‚Äôt the right one. As tensions rise and fan expectations soar, one thing is clear‚Äîchange is coming to Madison Square Garden.

Pros of the Trade

Cons of the Trade

Should the Los Angeles Lakers Pull the Trigger?

The‚Äô defensive flaws were exposed in the playoffs‚Äîparticularly their inability to slow down elite guards. While Luka Doncic anchored the paint, the perimeter defense often collapsed, leaving opponents with open lanes and easy shots. If the Lakers want to contend next season, they‚Äôll need a lockdown defender who can disrupt opposing backcourts. Enter‚Äîthe former Defensive Player of the Year, whose tenacity and leadership could be exactly what L.A. needs.But is he worth the risk? Smart‚Äôs recent injury history and hefty contract raise questions about whether he‚Äôs still the same game. A proposed trade would send Jarred Vanderbilt, Gabe Vincent, and a second-round pick to the Washington Wizards in exchange for Smart. Would this move fix the Lakers‚Äô biggest weakness, or would it be another costly gamble? Let‚Äôs break it down.The Los Angeles Lakers ‚Äô lack of a reliable point-of-attack (POA) defender hurt them in critical moments. Opposing guards consistently broke down their defense, leading to easy baskets or open shots. Marcus Smart, known for his relentless defense and leadership, could be the solution. Fade Away World proposed a trade where the Lakers would send Jarred Vanderbilt, Gabe Vincent, and the No. 55 pick in the 2025 NBA Draft to Washington in exchange for Smart.As the original article states: ‚ÄúMarcus Smart, the 2022 Defensive Player of the Year, brings tenacity and leadership to any team he joins. In the 2024‚Äì25 season, he averaged 9.0 points, 2.1 rebounds, and 3.2 assists per game with the Washington Wizards. His defensive intensity and experience could provide the Los Angeles Lakers with a much-needed perimeter stopper.‚Äù (H/t: Sporting News)While Smart‚Äôs defensive reputation is strong, his production has dipped since his peak with the Boston Celtics , where he earned three All-Defensive Team selections. Injuries have also been a concern:- Played only 54 games since leaving Boston in 2022-23.- Part of a salary dump trade from Memphis to Washington.- Currently on a four-year, $76.5 million deal.The Lakers must weigh whether his defensive impact outweighs the risk of his injury history.The proposed deal involves:- Elite Perimeter Defense: Smart can guard the best opposing guards, reducing pressure on LeBron James and Luka Doncic.- Playoff Experience: Smart‚Äôs leadership and toughness would help in high-stakes games.- Salary Flexibility: Moving Vanderbilt and Vincent clears cap space for future moves.- Injury Risk: Smart‚Äôs recent health issues raise concerns about his availability.- Offensive Limitations: His scoring has declined, which may not help the Lakers‚Äô offensive struggles.- Contract Length: His $76 million deal could limit future roster flexibility.If Marcus Smart stays healthy, he could be a perfect fit for the Lakers‚Äô defensive needs. However, given his recent injury history and declining offensive numbers, the front office must carefully evaluate whether he‚Äôs worth the assets.As Jon Conahan noted in the original article , ‚ÄúFactor that in with some of the injuries he's dealt with... it's tough to justify the Lakers giving up too much for him.‚ÄùAlso read: NBA Trade Rumors: Los Angeles Lakers predicted to acquire $61,980,000 superstar to support LeBron James and Luka Doncic after crippling playoff exit The Los Angeles Lakers need defensive upgrades, but they shouldn‚Äôt overpay for a player who may not be available when it matters most.

The Big Picture for the Golden State Warriors

isn‚Äôt getting any younger, and after another playoff disappointment, thecan‚Äôt afford to stand pat. With their championship window still barely open, Golden State needs a game-changing move‚Äîandmight be the perfect gamble.The Warriors‚Äô lack of size and secondary scoring was exposed in their playoff exit, leaving the front office with a clear mandate: go all-in now or risk wasting the final years of Curry‚Äôs legendary prime. A shocking trade with the Boston Celtics could be the answer‚Äîone that reshapes Golden State‚Äôs roster and reignites their title hopes.Here‚Äôs why this high-stakes deal makes sense for both sides‚Äîand how Porzingis could be the missing piece to unlock the Warriors‚Äô next championship run.According to Matthew Wadleigh of the Sporting News , the Golden State Warriors ‚Äô Western Conference Semifinals exit highlighted their need for size and scoring versatility.With Curry, Draymond Green, and head coach Steve Kerr‚Äôs window narrowing, Golden State must act fast.As Matthew noted in the original report: ""The clock is ticking on the Curry-Draymond Green era in Golden State."" A proposed trade from Bleacher Report‚Äôs Grant Hughes suggests a deal that could shake up both the Warriors and the Boston Celtics Kristaps Porzingis brings three key elements Golden State lacks:- Elite floor spacing: A career 36% three-point shooter who can pull defenders out of the paint.- Post scoring: A reliable option when Curry is doubled.- Rim protection: Averaged 1.9 blocks per game last season.Despite his defensive shortcomings, rookie Quinten Post was crucial to the Warriors' spacing throughout the season as they battled with size. Porzingis finds a solution to that issue without compromising his offensive game.The Boston Celtics must make financial and roster considerations. The Celtics might give flexibility top priority as Porzingis approaches the last year of his $60 million contract. In exchange, they would obtain:- Moses Moody: A young wing with upside.- Buddy Hield: A proven shooter to replace departing guards.- Trayce Jackson-Davis/Gui Santos: Developmental pieces on team-friendly contracts.A lineup of Curry, Jimmy Butler (if acquired), Green, and Porzingis would be a nightmare for opponents. The Warriors would regain their status as title contenders, leveraging Kristaps Porzingis‚Äô unique skill set to unlock new offensive schemes.With Curry‚Äôs career winding down, this trade isn‚Äôt just a gamble‚Äîit‚Äôs a necessity.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Los Angeles Lakers could be eyeing $61,980,000 Atlanta Hawks center in a blockbuster deal to bolster squad around LeBron James and Luka Doncic This move could redefine Golden State‚Äôs championship hopes‚Äîif they‚Äôre willing to pay the price.",Kristaps Porzingis could be the missing piece to unlock the Golden State Warriors‚Äô next championship run.

Niko Mikkola breaks out to propel Florida Panthers toward another Stanley Cup Final,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/niko-mikkola-breaks-out-to-propel-florida-panthers-toward-another-stanley-cup-final/articleshow/121398236.cms,"Image Via Twitter

Niko Mikkola proves his worth on both ends of the ice with Seth Jones

Florida Panthers defenseman Niko Mikkola has done so much in this deep playoff push for the team that it is now only a win away from a third consecutive Stanley Cup Final. In Game 3 against the Carolina Hurricanes, the towering 6-foot-6 blueliner wowed fans with his rare two-goal performance that led to a dominating 6-2 victory. While his on-ice contributions are growing with respect to the team's success, Mikkola fosters energy, humor, and focus around a team that is again hungry for the championship.Along with Seth Jones on the Panthers' second defensive unit, Mikkola has injected muscle and mobility into Florida's blue line. Interestingly, his Game 3 outing in Carolina was only the second multi goal game of his career, the first coming earlier this season, highlighting his recent surge in offensive confidence. He now has five points in these playoffs, which is his career-best, reinforcing his standing as more than just a shutdown defender.An unrestricted free agent, Mikkola was acquired by Florida on July 1, 2023, arriving from the St. Louis Blues and New York Rangers. Bill Zito, the general manager, had for some time admired Mikkola‚Äôs killer work ethic, his lateral size, and team-first attitude. Nicknamed ‚ÄúThe Condor‚Äù because of his wingspan, he uses those wings to glide fast up the ice, usually ambushing his opponents with his pace and poise.The skating and hockey IQ of Mikkola has flourished in Florida‚Äôs high-pressure, closing system. Head coach Paul Maurice called Mikkola's ""straight-line speed"" and instincts a mismatch and a perfect fit for their aggressive style. Mikkola showed his quick defense-to-offense transition and improvisational skills in his rush that led to the important goal in Game 1.Mikkola has also gained respect in the dressing room. Brad Marchand admires his intensity and sense of humor; the captain, Aleksander Barkov, talks about him as being ""great for us."" Once an impenetrable opponent, Mikkola has now become one of Florida‚Äôs most steadfast pieces in the championship chase.Also Read: Blackhawks to hire Jeff Blashill as head coach; Ryan Donato expected to hit free agencyFrom an unknown free agent to a crucial playoff performer, Niko Mikkola's journey with the Florida Panthers perfectly embodies the recipe for the team win: size, speed, spirit, and freedom to grow.","Florida Panthers defenseman Niko Mikkola wowed fans with his rare two-goal performance that led to a dominating 6-2 victory.

Poll Do you think Abhimanyu Easwaran will make his Team India debut during the England tour? Yes, he will finally get his chance No, he will miss out again

Shubman Gill story: From a remote village near the border to India‚Äôs Test captain

India's squad for five-match Test series against England includes Abhimanyu Easwaran , who's been a silent performer over the years in domestic cricket, piling on runs with impressive consistency. The 29-year-old cricketer is yet to make his Team India debut, falling short just when it all seemed certain to click. Easwaran could've been picked in the lineup during the 2018 tour of England, where he led the India-A side. However, Hanuma Vihari was preferred instead by the selectors.Easwaran was further picked in the national squad on four more instances, with India's 2024-25 tour of Australia the most recent of them all. However, Devdutt Padikkal was preferred ahead of the Bengal batter. The upcoming England tour provides a glorious opportunity for Easwaran to end this agonising wait, considering the chance to impress in Rohit Sharma's absence as well as the opportunity to lead India A.""Abhimanyu would've made his Team India debut long back had he got a chance to showcase his prowess in IPL. The tournament makes a big difference due to greater visibility.Abhimanyu is not a flamboyant player and doesn't run around the ground after scoring centuries. These things go against him. Abhimanyu has been a solid performer which is evident from his tally of 7,674 runs in 101 first-class matches at an average of 48.87. His experience across conditions in New Zealand, Australia, England and West Indies further sets him apart from other contenders,"" said Abhimanyu's father Ranganathan Easwaran in an exclusive interaction with TimesofIndia.com.The 29-year-old cricketer is following a specialised routine to prepare for English conditions in Dehradun, with express pacers from Delhi bowling tirelessly using duke balls.""Abhimanyu wakes up at 5.30 AM and spends hours facing pacers. We've organised two dozen duke balls to ensure no gap in preparation. He's batting on a green wicket with red soil because the bounce enables him to prepare extensively for English conditions. Abhimanyu is also engaging in specialised training to face spinners on the fourth or fifth day. He is studying every bowler in the English setup to handle every situation,"" said Ranganathan.Facing the number of disappointments as Abhimanyu can break down the strongest of spirits. However, the Bengal batter continues to battle it out with determination. Well, why wouldn't he, considering he idolises none other than 'The Wall' Rahul Dravid.""Abhimanu says, 'Not selecting me results in an even important thrust. Instead of banging the door, I have to break it. How can anyone shatter my dream just like that?'. His journey has stretched over 23 years, considering my son began playing cricket at six. I also motivate Abhimanyu by urging him to take inspiration from soldiers who train daily for war-like situations and stay mentally prepared for anything,"" said Ranganathan.""His regime is also very strict like soldiers, with focus on hitting the bed by 9.30-10 PM. Abhimanyu doesn't have a girlfriend. All that will have to wait till he achieves his dream of playing for India,"" he added.Gujarat batter Aarya Desai, who's been a friend of Abhimanyu for more than 10 years, highlighted his mamba mentality.""I've seen him push through everything. Nothing can disturb Abhimayu's preparation. One of the wallpapers on his phone is that of the Indian Test cap, which showcases what it means to him,"" said Aarya.""People labelled Abhimanyu as a slow batter who can't smash it big. He simply refuses to pay heed and focuses on scoring runs,"" added the Gujarat batter.Ex-Indian selector Saba Karim has termed Abhimanyu as the perfect candidate to open for India, considering his technique. A solid display for India A could well lead to louder calls for his selection.","Abhimanyu Easwaran has been a silent performer over the years in domestic cricket.

Zoey Stark‚Äôs injury overshadows Rhea Ripley‚Äôs MITB victory

WWE Superstar Zoey Stark made her comeback to the limelight in a tragic manner on the recent episode of Monday Night RAW. What was supposed to be a critical milestone in her career, Stark got severely injured in her knee in a triple-threat qualifying match for the 2025 Women's Money in the Bank (MITB) ladder match. The incident has not only sidelined her from one of WWE‚Äôs most prestigious events but may also signal a prolonged absence from in-ring competition.The accident occurred at the Bon Secours Wellness Arena in Greenville, South Carolina, during a MITB qualifier bout between Zoey Stark, Kairi Sane, and Rhea Ripley. At its climax, Stark tried her characteristic springboard dropkick‚Äîa sportslike move that requires agility and accuracy. In targeting Kairi Sane, Stark slipped in executing the springboard, resulting in her awkwardly landing on her right leg.The blow caused her knee to bend in a distinctly unnatural manner, quite visibly startling both supporters and commentators. The match instantly became secondary as paramedics rushed onto the field to treat the hurt athlete. After the botched maneuver, Stark fell to the floor, cradling her right knee and exhibiting obvious signs of pain and distress. The referee stopped the match for a moment and motioned for medical attention. WWE ringside physicians made their way into the ring and evaluated her condition.Despite the extent of the injury, Stark first tried to leave the ring independently. She tried to stand, only to fall again, as she could no longer bear the weight of herself. Eventually, she was assisted backstage by medical personnel, affirming the severity of the ordeal.Veteran WWE play-by-play commentator Michael Cole guessed on-air that Stark may have re-aggravated an old injury. Stark had extensive knee surgery in 2021 to repair a torn ACL, MCL, and meniscus‚Äîinjuries requiring months of rehabilitation.With the visual similarity and reaction of Stark, there is an increasing fear that her current injury is a recurrence or exacerbation of the same condition of the knee. But to date, WWE has not issued a formal medical diagnosis or recovery timeline. The wrestling fraternity came in support of Stark after the injury. AEW wrestler Thunder Rosa showed her concern with a heartfelt post on social media:""Wrestling is a lovely and risky sport. We leave everything on the table every time we go to the ring, and we also put a lot on the line when we do what we are passionate about. Zoey Stark, I love you, sister, and I hope that you heal soon."" ‚Äî Thunder Rosa through X (previously Twitter)Zoey Stark's RAW match was her first on television since January. She had last remained an active member of the dissolved faction Pure Fusion Collective, after Sonya Deville and Shayna Baszler left. Stark was competing mainly in non-televised WWE house shows and sporadic Main Event tapings before this return.As a result of her earlier knee damage incurred during her stint in NXT, Stark was drafted to the main roster as part of the 2023 WWE Draft‚Äîa testament to how much the WWE believed in her promising future. The MITB qualifier was set to be a career-launching experience, which made her untimely injury so much more heartbreaking.With Stark out, the match went on between the remaining participants. Rhea Ripley took advantage of the situation, overpowering Kairi Sane and finishing the match with her characteristic Riptide finisher. The pinfall win earned Ripley a spot in the upcoming ladder match for Women's Money in the Bank, which is to be held on June 7. Ripley‚Äôs victory, however, was overshadowed by the concern surrounding Stark‚Äôs health, as WWE fans and analysts alike shifted focus to the severity of the injury.The extent of Stark‚Äôs injury remains unconfirmed by WWE, leaving her return date unknown. Given her history of severe knee damage, fans and medical experts fear that she could face another lengthy recovery process. This injury not only removes her from one of WWE‚Äôs most career-defining matches but also risks stalling the momentum she had just begun to regain. For now, Zoey Stark‚Äôs fans‚Äîand the WWE Universe as a whole‚Äîawait official word from WWE‚Äôs medical team.","WWE superstar Zoey Stark suffers a painful knee injury during MITB qualifier match.

Dak Prescott‚Äôs comeback might be biggest tale this year

Dallas still needs to tackle running game

The Dallas Cowboys last season suffered a significant loss and ultimately a missed opportunity once their starting quarterback Dak Prescott suffered a hamstring injury. He was unable to play for half of the season and the Cowboys did not make the playoffs. However, things seem to be looking much better for Prescott and the Cowboys. So far, Prescott indicates that he's almost completely healthy, and it's only early in the year. Before the Cowboys start up a new season in September, he'll be ready to be the team's leader again.Pro Football Focus football writer Ryan Smith recently selected Dak Prescott as one of the most thrilling injury returns to witness this season. The Cowboys genuinely missed him last year, but now he is back and determined.During his final full season, Prescott played some of the best football of his life. He was wise with the ball, made huge plays, and helped the Cowboys win games.To assist Prescott further, the team drafted wide receiver George Pickens in a trade. Pickens is physical, fast, and excellent at catching difficult passes.He'll join CeeDee Lamb, perhaps the game's best receiver today. If they're paired together, they'll become one of the league's most feared receiver duos.Also Read: ""Keep Crying"": Dallas Stars' Coach Pete DeBoer Drags Connor McDavid Into Injury Controversy But Gets Brutally Trolled By Fans While Prescott and the receivers are looking solid, the Cowboys still have issues at running back.

Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce living together? Florida mansion sparks fan frenzy



The love story between Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce continues to unfold‚Äîthis time not on stage or on the football field, but possibly under the same roof. Though the two stars have made it a point to keep their relationship under wraps since the Super Bowl, a subtle remark by Kelce on his podcast New Heights might have dropped the biggest clue yet: they could be living together.During a recent episode of the podcast, Kelce, while chatting with his brother Jason and guest Ryan Fitzpatrick, casually mentioned his Florida offseason setup in Boca Raton. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got chimneys and we‚Äôve got furniture,‚Äù he said, describing his temporary home. It was the word ‚Äúwe‚Äù that sparked an online frenzy. Swifties immediately picked up on it, interpreting the phrase as a quiet confirmation that Swift may be sharing the luxurious $20 million rental with him.Travis Kelce didn‚Äôt give away much more, but when asked who was in charge of home d√©cor, he replied, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs an executive decision by myself for the betterment of everyone.‚Äù While playful, the comment left fans wondering whether someone else was helping create a cozy home atmosphere‚Äîsomeone with a knack for aesthetics and a history of romantic discretion.The mansion in question isn‚Äôt just any property. Nestled in an exclusive gated Boca Raton community, the estate reportedly includes six bedrooms, seven-and-a-half bathrooms, a private dock, wine cellar, home theater, and an opulent spa-style pool.With rent rumored to be around $100,000 per month, the setting is fit for pop royalty‚Äîand possibly a test run for future domestic life.Although Kelce and Swift have kept a low profile since the Kansas City Chiefs‚Äô Super Bowl loss, this subtle shift toward privacy is not random. According to insiders, the duo has intentionally stepped away from the spotlight to focus on each other. A source told Life & Style, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a dream period that‚Äôs only solidified that they‚Äôre on the same page about their future.‚Äù The couple is reportedly even ‚Äúamping up wedding discussions,‚Äù with another insider stating, ‚ÄúTravis is ‚Äòthe one,‚Äô and Taylor is going to marry him.

What owning her full catalog could mean for Taylor Swift's empire

In a surprising twist in one of music‚Äôs most infamous feuds, Taylor Swift may be on the verge of reclaiming the master recordings that defined the first decade of her career. According to a new report from Page Six, Scooter Braun‚Äîthe very figure she accused of ""stripping"" her of her life's work‚Äîis now reportedly facilitating a potential deal to return the rights to Swift.Back in 2019, Taylor Swift ignited a cultural firestorm when she revealed that she was blindsided by the sale of her original masters to Scooter Braun‚Äôs Ithaca Holdings. Despite her repeated attempts to buy them herself, she claimed she was never given the opportunity. ‚ÄúScooter has stripped me of my life‚Äôs work, that I wasn‚Äôt given an opportunity to buy,‚Äù Swift wrote in a viral Tumblr post. ‚ÄúEssentially, my musical legacy is about to lie in the hands of someone who tried to dismantle it. ‚ÄùBraun later sold those masters to Shamrock Capital for $300 million. Now, just six years later, the estimated value of those recordings has ballooned to somewhere between $600 million and $1 billion. And this time, the decision to bring Swift into the conversation may finally be in motion. ‚ÄúThe team at Shamrock want to make sure that Taylor has knowledge that they are trying to put this deal to her, as they are not sure that she was ever offered them the first time around,‚Äù a source told Page Six.With a current net worth estimated at $1.6 billion, Swift could realistically afford to repurchase her original masters outright. Doing so would make her the sole owner of both her re-recordings‚Äîbranded ‚ÄúTaylor‚Äôs Version‚Äù‚Äîand the original versions of albums like Fearless, Red, 1989, and Reputation.This unprecedented control would give Swift a rare dual-stream revenue model, allowing her to license both sets of recordings for publishing, commercials, film, and streaming‚Äîfurther solidifying her as one of the most powerful artists in music history.While fans love seeing her support her NFL boyfriend, Travis Kelce, who recently gushed, ‚ÄúI just listen to Taylor‚Äôs music‚Ä¶ she has something for everything,‚Äù Swift is clearly focused on something far more permanent: protecting and preserving her legacy.Also Read: ‚ÄúThankfully, I don't have to deal with that‚Äù: Kirk Cousins takes a jab at Travis Kelce‚Äôs body hair and Taylor Swift‚Äôs tolerance of it Should the deal go through, it would mark a full-circle moment in a saga that reshaped the industry‚Äîand a powerful victory for artists‚Äô rights everywhere.","Taylor Swift may be on the verge of reclaiming her master recordings.

Behind the stunts: Tom Cruise reveals the stakes and teamwork behind movie magic

Tom Cruise, one of Hollywood‚Äôs most fearless actors, made a headline-grabbing appearance on The Pat McAfee Show, promoting Mission: Impossible ‚Äì The Final Reckoning. But instead of just talking about cinema, Cruise drew a captivating comparison between his death-defying stunt work and the split-second decision-making of NFL quarterbacks‚Äîa moment that left host Pat McAfee visibly stunned.Tom Cruise, 62, is known not only for his longevity in the film industry but also for performing his own breathtaking stunts. On McAfee‚Äôs show, streamed on ESPN, ESPN+, and YouTube, Cruise pulled back the curtain on what it really takes to perform those action-packed scenes‚Äîand made an unexpected but compelling analogy to professional football.‚ÄúWhen you see a quarterback approach the line, he senses everything quickly,‚Äù Cruise explained. ‚ÄúThey know where every player is moving. They have to have spatial awareness of those around them. I have to know how close the plane is to the mountain.‚ÄùThe moment resonated deeply with McAfee and sports fans alike, drawing applause across social media. The analogy emphasized how both elite athletes and elite actors must operate under immense pressure, process information in real time, and lead teams with unwavering confidence and clarity.Cruise didn't stop at quarterbacks. He elaborated on how executing such high-risk scenes depends on flawless coordination and mutual trust. ‚ÄúTeamwork is key,‚Äù he stressed, pointing out that a single error could endanger not just himself but his entire film crew. The iconic plane stunt in Mission: Impossible served as a chilling example.His insights bridged the worlds of sports and cinema, showing how leadership, situational awareness, and accountability are critical in both.Cruise also reflected on his decades-long career and declared he plans to keep acting until he‚Äôs 100.

Poll What should be Alonso's top priority as head coach? Balancing the squad Grabbing top spot from Barcelona Managing star players like Mbappe and Vinicius Implementing a new formation

Former Real Madrid midfielder Xabi Alonso, 43, will take over as head coach from Carlo Ancelotti and lead the team at the upcoming Club World Cup, following a trophyless season. The Spanish manager faces several key challenges including balancing the squad, managing star players, and addressing the team's struggles against Barcelona.Real Madrid's squad balance has been a significant concern, with Ancelotti expressing frustration about the team's structure throughout the last season. ""Collective commitment"" was lacking in the team, according to Ancelotti, who struggled with too many attackers and defensive injuries while failing to replace retired midfielder Toni Kroos.The arrival of Kylian Mbappe from Paris Saint-Germain in 2024 brought changes to Madrid's Champions League and La Liga double-winning side. Despite scoring 43 goals across all competitions, Mbappe's partnership with Vinicius Junior initially faced challenges as they competed for the same space.Alonso must now devise a strategy to maximize the effectiveness of both players while maintaining defensive stability and pressing capabilities.The departure of veteran midfielder Luka Modric after the Club World Cup presents another challenge for Alonso's midfield planning.The former Bayer Leverkusen coach's preferred 3-4-3 formation could benefit Madrid's squad, particularly with Trent Alexander-Arnold's expected arrival from Liverpool and the confirmed signing of Bournemouth's Dean Huijsen.Managing the dressing room dynamics will be crucial for Alonso, following Ancelotti's successful tenure in handling star players and maintaining positive relationships with key stakeholders. Ancelotti's ability to manage personalities like Cristiano Ronaldo, Karim Benzema, and Gareth Bale, while developing Vinicius into a star player, demonstrated his excellent man-management skills.Real Madrid's performance against Barcelona sticks out like a sore thumb, with the team losing all four Clasicos this season. Barcelona's dominance included a 4-0 victory at Madrid's home ground in October, setting the tone for the season. A subsequent 4-3 win in the return league fixture helped Barcelona secure the Spanish title.

Which former WWE Champion said no to a heel turn similar to John Cena at this point in his career?

A former WWE Champion does not want to follow John Cena 's footsteps in reaching the top like he did after turning heel.John Cena's farewell tour took a drastic step when he turned heel at the 2025 WWE Elimination Chamber PLE. The Cenation Leader has turned into a ruthless superstar who plans to ruin wrestling. He claimed the top prize using underhanded tactics and made history at WrestleMania 41, when he defeated Cody Rhodes to win his 17th WWE Championship. However, a former champion, who has shared the ring with Cena, refused to go down the same path in a surprising turn.In an exclusive with The Times of India during WXM's event, former WWE Champion Jinder Mahal (now known as Raj Dhesi) was asked about John Cena's heel turn. The Modern Day Maharaja was excited to see Cena becoming a bad guy. However, he made it clear that at this stage of his career he wanted to give back to the business and wanted to win a World Championship fair and square.Mahal said, ""So I was excited to watch it. John Cena, heel turn. It's something fresh, something new. Again, as I mentioned, there's so many, surprises in pro wrestling, so many stories you can tell. So I was very happy to see that, but would I do anything? Probably at this stage in my career, I wouldn't.I'm about giving back to the business. I'm not gonna be so selfish, But, yeah, I'm I'm about giving back. But, again, if anybody wants a fair match, I, of course, wanna become WXM champion also, but I will do it this time the right way without the help of the Singh Brothers. I will do it myself.""This came as a surprising answer as Jinder Mahal had been a heel throughout his entire run in professional wrestling. The Maharaja was released by WWE in 2024. Since then he became a major stay on the independent circuit. Moreover, Mahal came to Mumbai, India to wrestle for the country's newest promotion, Wrestling Xtreme Media (WXM) at their debut event, Ground Zero: Powerbomb.While the former multi-time champion has closed the door on a heel turn, he still very much has aspirations to rise at the top as a top-tier World Champion. So it will be interesting to see if he can get it done in top promotions.Also read: Former WWE Champion Jinder Mahal talks wrestling in WXM, John Cena, Vince McMahon, Seth Rollins, and more","Former WWE Champion Jinder Mahal was asked about John Cena's heel turn.

Navigating fame and expectations as Deion Sanders‚Äô son



Shedeur Sanders, rookie quarterback for the Cleveland Browns, has become a frequent target of online criticism, but not entirely for reasons tied to his own performance. Much of the scrutiny surrounding him appears to stem from the larger-than-life presence of his father, Deion Sanders. As a Hall of Famer and head coach of the Colorado Buffaloes, Deion‚Äôs high-profile persona and outspoken nature have drawn both admiration and backlash over the years. That legacy, while inspiring, has also cast a long and often complicated shadow over Shedeur‚Äôs journey to the NFL.Shedeur Sanders has faced waves of criticism as he enters the NFL, much of it influenced by long-standing opinions held by older generations. In a recent visit to a Cleveland high school, Shedeur opened up about the criticism he receives and offered a revealing explanation behind it.‚ÄúA lot of it is just people hating on my dad. Older generations have a problem with him, and they take it out on me. I want to be someone they can look up to and ask real questions.‚ÄùSome analysts believe Shedeur Sanders‚Äô unexpected fall in the 2025 NFL Draft was partly due to lukewarm interviews with teams and unspoken biases tied to his background.His father, Deion Sanders, has publicly pushed back against what he sees as misleading narratives that may have negatively affected how teams evaluated his son.Despite the controversy, Shedeur views his father‚Äôs involvement as a strength, not a setback. Reflecting on the criticism around his father‚Äôs presence, Shedeur offered a pointed response, ""I didn't know your parents being involved and wanting the best for you is a problem."" His words highlight the frustration of navigating a system where family support is sometimes viewed with suspicion rather than respect.In the midst of career pressures and public scrutiny, Shedeur Sanders continues to prioritize his role beyond the football field. Rather than letting criticism harden him, he‚Äôs using his platform to connect with younger generations in meaningful ways. ""I want to be someone they can look up to and ask real questions,"" he stated.Also read: ‚ÄúI didn't insult or attack her,‚Äù Ryan Clark states acknowledging misstep in explosive RGIII feud His approach is rooted in accessibility and authenticity, qualities that resonate with those who see him not just as an athlete, but as someone relatable and open.

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee ‚Äî Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match ‚Äî before the Nagpur ODI ‚Äî more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‚ÄòHitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

Delhi Results 2025: 'LinkedIn Lessons' from Brand BJP's win and Brand AAP's loss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-results-2025-linkedin-lessons-from-brand-bjps-win-and-brand-aaps-loss/articleshow/118066797.cms,"AAP: From Disruptor to Establishment to Decline



AAP was the ultimate political startup‚Äîthe kind that raises Series A, B, and C funding at record speed, becomes a unicorn, and then implodes under its own weight. It was supposed to be the alternative to traditional politics, the fresh face in a crowded market, a party that rejected caste, religion, and dynasty-driven politics.

But somewhere along the way, it stopped being a startup and started behaving like an old-school corporate giant‚Äîbloated, bureaucratic, and overconfident.

1) From Lean & Agile to Bureaucratic & Slow

AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach‚Äîthe political equivalent of a D2C brand shaking up a legacy market.

Over time, it became centralized and top-heavy, with decision-making confined to a handful of leaders. MLAs became inaccessible, the leadership became distant, and ground-level mobilization weakened. No succession planning. Kejriwal remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab‚Äîdespite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force.

remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab‚Äîdespite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force. The result? Voters saw it as just another party, not the disruptor it once was.

2) A Reputation Built on Ethics, Lost to Scandals

AAP built its brand on fighting corruption‚Äîbut its own leadership got embroiled in one of the biggest scandals of its time, the liquor policy scam.

Manish Sisodia, Sanjay Singh, and even Kejriwal himself faced corruption allegations, undoing years of anti-corruption positioning.

The Sheesh Mahal controversy‚Äîwhere Kejriwal‚Äôs residence was allegedly renovated with ‚Çπ45 crore of taxpayer money‚Äîcompletely shattered the ‚Äúhumble leader‚Äù narrative.

AAP‚Äôs response? Defensive, aggressive, and dismissive. Instead of damage control, it doubled down on denial‚Äîa classic PR blunder.

The perception shift was swift and brutal‚Äîfrom ‚Äúanti-corruption warriors‚Äù to just another power-hungry political entity.

3) Ignoring the Middle-Class Voter That Built Its Base

AAP was originally the party of the middle class‚Äîfrustrated taxpayers who wanted clean governance and economic relief.

Over time, its focus shifted to freebies and populist policies, leaving the middle class feeling ignored.

BJP stepped in at the right time‚Äîoffering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters.

stepped in at the right time‚Äîoffering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters. Kejriwal‚Äôs pre-election outreach to the middle class felt forced and last-minute‚Äîwhile BJP had already solidified its positioning.

Takeaway ? A business (or party) that forgets its core customer will eventually lose them.

4) Blaming External Factors Instead of Owning Failures

For 10 years, AAP blamed the Centre, the LG, and opposition parties for everything.

The ‚Äúvictim card‚Äù was effective in the early years but wore thin by 2025‚Äîvoters expected governance, not excuses.

BJP flipped this weakness into an advantage, promising that with a BJP-led government, there would be no Centre-state conflicts, leading to ‚Äúseamless governance.‚Äù

The narrative changed from ‚ÄúAAP vs. BJP‚Äù to ‚ÄúAAP vs. Results.‚Äù Lesson? Leaders who constantly shift blame instead of delivering solutions lose credibility.

5) Strategic Missteps and Lack of Political Alliances

AAP contested separately from Congress, which led to a split in the anti-BJP vote.

Rahul Gandhi‚Äôs direct attacks on Kejriwal made matters worse‚ÄîAAP was getting hit from both sides.

Internal conflicts weakened the party further. Atishi and Saurabh Bharadwaj were seen as Kejriwal‚Äôs successors, but there was no clear transition strategy.

BJP: A Masterclass in Strategic Adaptation

BJP‚Äôs 2025 win in Delhi was not a Modi-centric sweep but a well-calibrated organizational comeback. After a lackluster 2024 Lok Sabha performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader.

performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader. Unlike AAP, BJP adapted, restructured, and executed flawlessly.

1) Moving Beyond Modi Dependency

BJP understood that Delhi‚Äôs electorate needed a more localized approach.

Instead of making the election about Modi, it focused on governance, urban issues, and direct voter engagement.

No CM face? It didn‚Äôt matter. The party projected collective leadership instead of relying on one individual.

By decentralizing its campaign, BJP looked more stable and future-ready.

2) Adopting AAP‚Äôs Own Strategies Against It

BJP neutralized AAP‚Äôs welfare advantage‚Äîpromising free electricity, continued subsidies, and additional financial support for women.

Middle-class tax reliefs were announced just before the elections, ensuring they won over voters that AAP had neglected.

The manifesto focused on real urban issues‚Äîpollution control, traffic congestion, and infrastructure‚Äîexactly what AAP had failed to address convincingly.

Lesson? The best way to beat a competitor is to adopt their strengths while exposing their weaknesses.

3) Letting Congress Do The Attacking



BJP didn‚Äôt need to attack AAP aggressively‚ÄîRahul Gandhi and Congress did that for them.

By letting AAP and Congress fight it out, BJP consolidated its voter base while the opposition split.

AAP‚Äôs credibility suffered more because the attacks came from within the anti-BJP camp.

A strategic win, without unnecessary effort.

4) A Disciplined, Focused, and Well-Executed Campaign

BJP stayed on message, focusing on corruption, governance, and economic stability.

The campaign was structured and well-planned, unlike AAP‚Äôs which seemed reactive and disorganized.

The promise to investigate AAP‚Äôs corruption cases resonated with voters, reinforcing BJP‚Äôs stance on accountability.

In business terms? BJP had a clear marketing strategy, strong brand positioning, and flawless execution.

5) Final Takeaways

Adaptability is key. BJP recalibrated after its 2024 Lok Sabha setbacks, while AAP remained stagnant.

Brand trust is fragile. AAP built its image on honesty but lost credibility due to scandals and mismanagement.

Execution matters more than rhetoric. BJP delivered a disciplined, well-structured campaign.

Leadership succession planning is critical. AAP failed to build second-line leadership, while BJP showcased organizational depth.

Voters reward governance, not excuses. After a decade in power, AAP‚Äôs blame game no longer worked.

Politics, like business, rewards those who adapt, execute, and deliver.

Ah, another election, another flood of LinkedIn wisdom posts‚Äîwhere every poll result is a ""case study,"" every political leader is a ""CEO,"" and every campaign is an ""MBA-level lesson in leadership."" Some call it democracy, but on LinkedIn, it‚Äôs all about business jargon and corporate analogies.So, let‚Äôs break this down the LinkedIn way.BJP, on the other hand, had a structured, disciplined campaign with clear messaging and no internal rifts. In politics and business, a divided team rarely wins.","AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach.

From luxury gifts to baby bump buzz, fans had a lot to say after the couple‚Äôs show-stopping ceremony

Travis Hunter and Leanna Lenee‚Äôs wedding has made headlines not just for its elegance but also for the buzz it stirred online afterward. Held at a scenic Tennessee venue, the couple‚Äôs lavish celebration was a blend of style, emotion, and grand gestures, including a surprise luxury car gifted by Hunter to his bride. But while fans were still gushing over the wedding details, whispers of a possible pregnancy quickly took center stage on social media.Eagle-eyed followers began speculating after videos from the wedding showed Leanna Lenee in a fitted gown, with some claiming she appeared to have a baby bump. The couple has not confirmed or denied the rumors, choosing instead to focus on their newlywed bliss. Still, that silence hasn‚Äôt stopped fans and critics alike from fueling the conversation.Remarks such as ‚ÄúIs she pregnant?‚Äù and ‚ÄúShe looks like she‚Äôs already pregnant‚Äù quickly flooded the comment sections. It‚Äôs intriguing to see how this moment represents the stress high-profile people and especially young pairs like Hunter and Lenee experience in the public eye. Every gesture, every expression, and every outfit becomes subject to interpretation. For Lenee, this isn't the first time she‚Äôs been scrutinized, past social media moments have brought her mixed attention, but she and Hunter have stood firm as a unit.In November 2024, Travis tackled pregnancy rumors head-on during his appearance on the ""2Legendary"" podcast. Addressing speculation that he and Leanna were expecting twins, he firmly denied it, saying, ""I don't have no twins on the way, bro. I don't even play like that."" He went on to mock the bizarre nature of the claim, adding, ""They say I got twins on the way so one can play offense and one can play defense - you're weird. Why would you even post that?""Leanna has also spoken out against similar assumptions. In July 2024, when a fan made a comment about her looks and suggested she might be pregnant, she didn‚Äôt hold back. ""I'd never have a baby without wedding/marriage first,"" she stated.Also read: ‚ÄúHating on my dad‚Äù: Shedeur Sanders opens up about carrying the weight of Deion Sanders‚Äô name A pregnancy may not even be the main focus of the real story, even if a baby is due. They are still working through celebrity, falling in love and managing what the public expects, all while trying to keep their individual happiness. Right now, Travis and Leanna appear to focus on their special connection and limit who they share their lives with. Maybe that‚Äôs why their love grows stronger, because they can show their love however they like, leaving everyone else curious.","Fans flood Travis Hunter and Leanna Lenee's wedding posts with baby rumors.

IPL 2025: Daniel Vettori explains Shami‚Äôs struggles, Reddy‚Äôs limited role

Ajinkya Rahane reflects on KKR‚Äôs inconsistent IPL 2025, backs under-fire Venkatesh Iyer

Brief Scores:

NEW DELHI: Sunrisers Hyderabad started this IPL season by posting 286/4 against Rajasthan Royals. On Sunday evening, in front of a half-empty Feroz Shah Kotla, they ended their campaign with 278/3 against Kolkata Knight Riders in an inconsequential match. The team‚Äôs struggles between the two matches notwithstanding, SRH batting lived up to its reputation of being power-packed entertainers.The score was always going to be daunting for KKR to chase down as they folded timidly for just 168 in 18.4 overs and brought down the curtains on an ordinary season under Ajinkya Rahane When Heinrich Klaasen nonchalantly brought up his 100 off 37 balls in the final ball of the 19th over, he stood for the very essence of SRH‚Äôs batting prowess. They may have faltered for most part of the season, but Travis Head‚Äôs 76 off 40 and Abhishek Sharma‚Äôs 16-ball 32 that complemented Klaasen‚Äôs unbeaten 105 off 39, was all about the entertainment this batting unit had promised coming into the tournament. Defending the target, Jaydev Unadkat and Eshan Malinga returned figures of 3/24 and 3/31.For Sunrisers, their batters finishing the season strongly was important for their pride. They bowed out promising another big season next year.Perhaps, the SRH batters went into a game unencumbered for the first time in the tournament. The absolute hard and flat track played a catalyst against a visibly low-on-confidence KKR bowling attack. What Head and Klaasen did must have left the KKR bowlers scarred. The two batters hardly broke a sweat as they crunched 6 and 9 sixes.F or KKR, Varun Chakravarthy‚Äôs deliveries never lacked bite like it did on Sunday. This season, it became more evident that he is a pale shadow of himself on pitches that offered little assistance for his mystery spin. Klaasen went about smoking one effortless six after another down the ground as if Chakravarthy was giving him harmless throwdowns. KKR‚Äôs trump card eventually returned figures of 0/54 in three overs.On the whole, SRH‚Äôs batting has been a symbol of brute force for the last two seasons.Sunrisers Hyderabad: 278/3 in 20 overs (Heinrich Klaasen 105 not out, Travis Head 76; Sunil Narine 2/42) vs Kolkata Knight Riders: 168 all out in 18.4 overs (Manish Pandey 37, Harshit Rana 34; Jaydev Unadkat 3/24, Eshan Malinga 3/31, Harsh Dubey 3/34).Result: SRH won by 110 runs.",Sunrisers Hyderabad beat Kolkata Knight Riders by 110 runs. Heinrich Klaasen scored 105 off 39 balls. Travis Head scored 76 off 40. Jaydev Unadkat and Eshan Malinga took 3/24 and 3/31.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121403185,imgsize-126378,width-400,resizemode-4/121403185.jpg"
