Rodgers playing the waiting game: Patience or lack of interest?



All Signs Seem To Be Leading To Aaron Rodgers Being A Steeler... So Why Are We Waiting? | Pat McAfee

Rodgers’ retirement still looming?



The NFL offseason is buzzing with speculation, and one of the biggest storylines centers around Aaron Rodgers . Once the face of the Green Bay Packers and, more recently, a brief but injury-plagued experiment with the New York Jets, Rodgers now finds himself without a team. But is the veteran quarterback biding his time for the right opportunity, or is he running out of viable options?Rodgers has never been one to rush decisions, and his current free agency saga reflects that. With the New York Giants opting for Russell Wilson and the Minnesota Vikings locking in their future with rookie J.J. McCarthy, his options appear slim. The Pittsburgh Steelers remain a possible landing spot, but sources indicate Rodgers is hesitant to commit.While Pittsburgh offers a competitive roster and a strong defense, reports suggest Rodgers may not be fully sold on the fit. His recent throwing session with new Steelers wideout DK Metcalf raised eyebrows, but a contract hasn’t followed, leading to speculation that he may have ulterior motives.One prevailing theory is that Rodgers is playing the long game. Injuries are inevitable in the NFL, and quarterback vacancies could arise before the season kicks off. By staying patient, Rodgers might be positioning himself for a better opportunity—one where he can step into a playoff-ready team rather than forcing a fit with a Steelers squad still finding its offensive identity.Minnesota remains a wildcard in this equation. If McCarthy struggles early in training camp or preseason, the Vikings could feel pressure to bring in a proven veteran. Some insiders believe Rodgers is stalling to keep that door open, even if Minnesota has publicly committed to its young quarterback.Then there’s the possibility that Rodgers simply walks away. At 41, he has nothing left to prove. His legacy as a Super Bowl champion and multiple-time MVP is secure. With media and business opportunities awaiting him off the field, he may decide the right situation isn’t worth the wait.Also Read: NFL eyes Middle East: Could UAE host a game soon?

Thehave surged toward the NBA playoffs andhas been at the heart of their resurgence. After showing signs of decline earlier in the season, Curry has rediscovered his form, making history in the process.At 37 years old, Curry finished March averaging 23.8 points per game, becoming the oldest guard to average 20+ points in a calendar month since Michael Jordan . He also set another record as the oldest point guard in NBA history to achieve this for an entire month.Key stats from Curry’s recent performances:- February average: 30.7 points per game- March average: 23.8 points per game- Age: 37 (as of March 14)This level of production is rare for a player in their 16th NBA season, underscoring Curry’s enduring impact.Before Jimmy Butler joined the team, Curry’s numbers were below his career averages, and the Golden State Warriors appeared to be fading. The trade has injected new energy into both Curry and the franchise, positioning them as potential playoff contenders.Curry showed his tenacity by returning to activity in spite of recent setbacks, such as exhaustion and a pelvic ailment that kept him out of action for a while. Curry took a short break after coach Steve Kerr recognized his fatigue, but the standout player has already recovered.The Warriors currently sit in sixth place in the Western Conference with a 43-31 record. A win against the Memphis Grizzlies on Tuesday would propel them into fifth place, tightening their grip on a favorable playoff position.- Playoff seeding is critical for avoiding a tough first-round matchup.- Curry’s health and form will dictate how far the Warriors can go.- Butler’s presence has alleviated pressure on Curry, allowing him to thrive.As the regular season winds down, all eyes remain on Stephen Curry and the Golden State Warriors to see if their late-season surge translates into postseason success.Also read: Luka Doncic sets new Los Angeles Lakers record after blockbuster win over Houston Rockets On April 1, 2025, Stephen Curry added another milestone to his illustrious career by becoming the oldest player in NBA history to record 52 points, 10 rebounds, and 8 assists during the Golden State Warriors’ game against the Memphis Grizzlies.

Travis Kelce’s struggles in 2024: Why he blames the Taylor Swift spotlight for his Chiefs' decline,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/travis-kelces-struggles-in-2024-why-he-blames-the-taylor-swift-spotlight-for-his-chiefs-decline/articleshow/119927342.cms,"Image via Imagn Images

Travis Kelce’s 2024 stats take a dive, and fans speculate the reason

Did Taylor Swift’s global fame add unwanted pressure?



Travis Kelce addresses the slump but remains determined for 2025



Can Travis Kelce bounce back, or is retirement looming?

Kansas City Chiefs ' superstar tight end Travis Kelce had a rough 2024 season, and he's not shying away from discussing what may have played a role in his dip in performance. After a career-worst statistical season—excluding his rookie year—Kelce openly reflected on the overwhelming media attention surrounding his relationship with Taylor Swift and how it may have affected his game.For a player who has consistently been among the NFL’s elite, Kelce’s 2024 season was a disappointment. Across 17 games, he managed only 823 receiving yards—far from his 1,416-yard peak in 2020. The season culminated in a disastrous Super Bowl LIX loss to the Philadelphia Eagles, where Kelce recorded just four catches for 39 yards in a crushing 40-22 defeat.Kelce didn’t hold back on his self-criticism. “I let my guys down,” he admitted on his New Heights podcast on March 5, reflecting on his struggles. The frustration even had him considering retirement at age 35, a thought he openly shared with fans.Kelce’s relationship with Swift, which took off in 2023, brought unparalleled global attention. From high-profile Eras Tour cameos to lyrical nods in Swift’s music, their romance became a pop culture phenomenon. But with fame came distractions. “So much attention on their relationship is not the best thing,” a source told US Weekly, revealing that the couple dialed back public displays of affection following the Super Bowl loss.Fans on social media were quick to speculate, with some blaming Swift’s global influence for Kelce’s decline. “Swift’s fame threw him off!” one user posted, pointing out how Kelce’s numbers dipped significantly compared to previous seasons. A romantic getaway to New Orleans with Patrick and Brittany Mahomes just two days before the Super Bowl also sparked debates, with critics questioning if the distractions were affecting the Chiefs' focus.Despite the speculation, Kelce acknowledges that 2024 was not his best season but stops short of blaming his relationship for his struggles. “I don’t think it was my best outing,” he admitted on New Heights, recalling how he felt “anonymous” in the Super Bowl matchup against the Eagles.After the disappointing loss, Kelce and Swift retreated from the spotlight, spending time together away from the public eye. “Just doing nothing at all has been a dream of theirs,” a US Weekly source shared, emphasizing the couple’s desire for normalcy amid the chaos of fame.Kelce has committed to returning for the 2025 season, promising fans on The Pat McAfee Show on February 27 that he’s ready to “get back to the mountaintop” and erase the “bad taste” left by 2024. While some fans believe Swift’s orbit impacted his three-touchdown slump, others argue that age and the physical toll of the game played a bigger role.“I still love playing,” Kelce assured fans. However, the lingering retirement whispers suggest that if another season of struggles follows, the Chiefs legend may have a difficult decision to make. One thing is certain: whether Swift’s influence is a factor or not, all eyes will be on Kelce in 2025 to see if he can reclaim his dominance on the field.Also Read: Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce celebrate baby news as wedding rumors continue to swirl",Travis Kelce had a career-worst statistical season in 2024.

Tracy McGrady says modern NBA stars will crush LeBron James in one-on-one



TRACY MCGRADY INVITED US TO HIS HOUSE! | The Makeshift Podcast 125

Former NBA star Tracy McGrady has recently claimed that LeBron James would not stand a chance in a one-on-one game with modern stars in the league. Of course, McGrady acknowledged James’ legendary resume in the league and his legacy-enriched records that put him in the GOAT (greatest of all time) debate among fans alongside Michael Jordan . McGrady’s statement on James has sparked a swift online buzz among fans.LeBron James’ stunning NBA career has been a subject of discussion for more than a decade. In his recent appearance in the Makeshift Project, Tracy McGrady shared an explosive remark on James.“I think LeBron has been amazing for 22 freaking years. And he’s been the best basketball player for, you know, God knows how long. But if you put him in one-on-one? I think he’ll get crushed. Yeah, I think he’ll get crushed — amongst guys that are actually in the NBA. And I’m sure LeBron would tell you that. Because his game is naturally built for five-on-five. He’s not a one-on-one basketball player. Kobe is a one-on-one basketball player. Kyrie is a one-on-one basketball player. James Harden — these guys are one-on-one basketball players. And LeBron can’t do anything with that,” McGrady said.When he was asked about the GOAT debate , “Tracy McGrady who is the greatest basketball player of all time LeBron James or Michael Jordan or are you?” McGrady replied instantly, “I'm tired of this question, man. I hope we just dead this question.”He started off acknowledging James’ dominance in the court. “What I'm witnessing now and by any means this doesn't make him the greatest player to me but what I am witnessing with my own eyes is watching a 40 year old man do on the basketball court, is the greatest thing I ever seen in sports. I would say that it is the greatest thing my eyes have seen in sports for a 40 year old guy to do what he's doing at that level and to do that consistently every single night.”McGrady further compared his age with James, acknowledging the physical demand to go through such athletic prowess, “I'm 45 and I know what it takes to put your body through that right every single day and he's been doing that for what his 22nd year.”When it comes to taking sides in the GOAT debate, McGrady said, “I don't care about who's the greatest more I really don't I don't care I don't care about it MJ had a phenomenal career, LeBron has had a phenomenal career, you know? All those guys had freaking phenomenal careers like they can be in a room having a discussion with one another and talking trash that's really that I mean. Really doesn't matter like they all in the same room.”Also Read: "" Celebrating a man landing on the ground?"": LeBron James' one-legged shot against Houston Rockets sparks mixed reactions from fans Regardless, James is still playing at an elite level, averaging 24.4 points per game, 8.1 rebounds, and 8.4 assists.","Tracy McGrady says modern NBA stars will crush LeBron James in one-on-one game.

NEW DELHI: Letsile Tebogo , the Olympic 200m champion from Botswana, shared his inspiring journey and the pivotal role athletics played in keeping him away from delinquency.Growing up in a neighborhood plagued by criminal activities, Tebogo acknowledged that without the focus provided by sports, he could have easily fallen into the wrong path.""Sport has really helped me a lot because I think without sport ... probably I would be a criminal by now,"" 21-year-old Tebogo said. ""In the neighbourhood where I grew up there were a lot of criminals, it was the only way to survive. But then with sport I knew I had to go to school and with training you are tired. You don't have time to roam the streets and go into people's houses.""""So once I discovered that I tried to pull in a few friends of mine ... and now they are playing football,"" he added. ""We always talk about if this didn't work out, where would we be?""Tebogo credited athletics for giving him a purpose and keeping him occupied, preventing him from roaming the streets and engaging in unlawful activities.He even encouraged his friends to take up sports like football, recognising the positive impact it had on their lives.""I was more of a footballer, a left-winger. The teachers at my primary school forced me into athletics. (Athletics) wasn't that popular in Botswana back then, until the Commonwealth Games 2018. From my side I just wanted to see where it would take me. Athletics was just a part-time thing for me,"" he added.Despite athletics not being popular in Botswana at the time, Tebogo's switch to the sport paid off handsomely when he beat legendary Noah Lyles to clinch the gold medal in the 200m event at the 2024 Paris Olympics , setting an African record of 19.46 seconds.While Tebogo clarified his previous comments about Noah Lyles' ""arrogance,"" stating that it's all business on the track.""When you get onto the track, it's all about business,"" he added. ""When we finish, you can be friends, life goes on. But the 'arrogance' (of Lyles)... he is good to sell our sport. But with me, I'll always shy away from doing that because that's me.""As he prepares for the upcoming Diamond League meetings and the World Championships in Tokyo, Tebogo expects fierce competition from his rivals.""Everybody who's there on the lineup, it's a rival. You cannot eliminate somebody because he didn't perform well at the 2024 Olympics or 2023 World Championships,"" he concluded.Tebogo had also set a new U20 world record for 100m, clocking 9.96 seconds at the Gaborone International Meet in 2022.",Olympic 200m champion Letsile Tebogo talks about his inspiring journey.

LeBron James suffers injury during Golden State Warriors vs Los Angeles Lakers matchup



Fans reacted to LeBron James’ collision with Jonathan Kuminga



The highly anticipated Golden State Warriors vs Los Angeles Lakers matchup has already stirred intense drama. Lakers veteran LeBron James collided with Warriors' Jonathan Kuminga, which made him go down hard on the hardwood. James was seen in intense pain following the fall. Later, the medical team attended the star to evaluate his injury status. At that point, all eyes were on James, as his injury would be very devastating for the team’s depth. Fans online have mixed reactions to the incident.There was a collective gasp at the Crypto.com Arena on Thursday night as LeBron James hit the hardwood in visible pain during the opening quarter of the matchup between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Golden State Warriors. LeBron went down after a brutal collision with Warriors forward Jonathan Kuminga.The incident happened midway through the first quarter as LeBron was on his way toward the basket. LeBron inadvertently ran straight into Kuminga near the paint. The impact caught him in the midsection, and the 40-year-old star immediately collapsed, clutching his abdomen in clear discomfort. Soon, the trainers and teammates rushed to his side.Veteran sports analyst Skip Bayless took to social media, writing, ""Did LeBron just get the breath knocked out of him running into Kuminga? Never seen him stay down that long. Seems OK now.""ESPN’s Dave McMenamin also shared an update on X (formerly Twitter), stating, ""LeBron James got hit in his midsection by Jonathan Kuminga and was down on the floor for a spell. It appears he will be OK. He is subbing out, but was walking it off during the timeout.""Although the scene was alarming, Lakers fans could finally exhale when LeBron stood up and made his way to the bench under his own power. He was subbed out as the team called a timeout, but signs quickly pointed to it being a painful knock rather than a serious injury.James’ injury was an immediate concern for online fans as well. They quickly responded to the Lakers veteran’s collision with the Warriors’ Jonathan Kuminga.“My worst nightmare,” one fan wrote.One fan condemned Kuminga, “Standard dirty play from Kuminga - not the first time.”“My heart stopped for 30 seconds 😭😭💜💛 Please be ok Lebron,” one fan wrote wishing James’ speedy recovery.Another wrote, “Hopefully just got the wind knocked out of him.”“Take the night off.

LUCKNOW: Pacer Akash Deep has declared himself “100% fit and ready to play” after having recovered from the back injury that plagued him in Australia and kept him away from the game for the last three months.Akash Deep joined LSG on Thursday night and was seen in franchise colours for the first time at the pre-game media interaction.“I’m feeling quite ready and am eager to play. I’m 100% fit and well-prepared to go as I’ve played one practice match. In cricket, when you get a gap of two-three months, no matter how much you practice, you don’t gain confidence until you play a match. I feel the first match (will be) very important for me,” he said.Asked about the team’s below-par performance so far, Akash Deep said, “In cricket, performance is not in our control. Even though only three matches have been played, there have been many positive aspects for our team. Despite four of our fast bowlers being injured, the way we performed in the first three games is commendable. I think there are many good things with us, and since the tournament is quite long, good things are yet to come.""We’ve see in IPL matches during the last two years, you can’t predict a safe target. There have been instances when teams have failed to defend 240 or 260. If our fast-bowling unit is together, we have a balanced side.”On switching from RCB to LSG, the pacer said, “The jersey may change but the person will remain the same. I’m feeling very good with this franchise. I haven’t spent much time with the team yet, but the time I did spend, which was about 2-3 days during the preparatory camp, it felt great and gave me a lot of confidence. Because I was at the NCA in rehab, I joined the team (only) last night, and today is the first practice session. I haven’t had much interaction with the coaches yet.”On Zaheer Khan’s mentorship of the franchise, he said, “I’m lucky to have the opportunity to play under such a great coach, even if it’s just for 2-3 months. His international experience is excellent, and he will identify and improve my skills and fine-tune my weaknesses and variations.”Asked how injured LSG speed sensation Mayank Yadav’s rehab was coming along, he said, “I believe it’ll be good if he can join the team soon.”",Akash Deep joined LSG on Thursday night and was seen in franchise colours for the first time at the pre-game media interaction.

Rachin Ravindra misjudges the ball under bad lights and takes a brutal hit near the eye. Hope he recovers soon....।।।"" said a fan on X (formerly Twitter).""Rachin Ravindra is a far better fielder than the whole team of Pakistan, still can't see the ball while catching??

ICC should ensure players' safety and if Pakistan can't provide shift CHAMPIONS TROPHY to Dubai. Prayers for Rachin Ravindra,"" penned another fan.The incident has sparked a wider conversation about the standards of infrastructure and safety measures in place for international cricket matches, with some fans suggesting that the International Cricket Council (ICC) should reassess the suitability of venues based on such criteria.The match concluded with New Zealand defeating Pakistan by 78 runs, setting a challenging target of 330/6 in their 50 overs, bolstered by significant contributions from Glenn Phillips, Kane Williamson , and Daryl Mitchell. Prior to his injury, Ravindra had contributed a quick 25 runs off 19 balls.ALSO READ: Phillips, Santner shine as New Zealand crush Pakistan by 78 runs",New Zealand cricketer Rachin Ravindra suffered a forehead injury during ODI tri- series match against Pakistan.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

In a unique farewell , a 55-year-old man was laid to rest in a Snickers-themed coffin , an idea he had often joked about in life and ensured was included in his will.According to a report from SWNS, Paul Broome , from England, was known for his sharp wit and mischievous sense of humour.

CHENNAI: R Sai Kishore has been one of the best finger spinners in the Indian domestic circuit for a few years now. But the Tamil Nadu left-arm orthodox bowler had to bide his time to become a regular playing member in the Indian Premier League IPL ).In his first IPL stint at Chennai Super Kings, Sai Kishore warmed the bench for two successive seasons as he was expectedly behind Ravindra Jadeja, a master of his craft, in the pecking order.While the tweaker broke into the Gujarat Titans (GT) XI in the business end of their title-winning campaign in 2022, he had to be content with a bit-part role in the previous three-year cycle because of the presence of top-quality spinners in Rashid Khan and Noor Ahmad. But this year, he has been a regular feature.On Wednesday at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium against Royal Challengers Bengaluru, it was his spell of 2 for 22 that went a long way in Titans winning the game. The lanky left-armer was bought back by Titans for Rs 2 crore using the ‘Right To Match’ card at the mega auction.With Noor making the move to CSK, Sai Kishore, who has a phenomenal economy of 5.98 in 73 T20 matches, has been elevated to a frontline spinner in the ‘playing XII’ (including the Impact Player). The 28-year-old is leading the wickets chart for GT with six scalps in three matches.“I’m actually looking forward to this season (playing more matches). All this while, I’ve watched a lot of games and learnt a lot. I’ve been very honest with myself and have worked really hard. Let us hope that this season is a wonderful one,” said Sai Kishore after GT’s win over Mumbai Indians in Ahmedabad.The left-arm slow bowler has underlined his credentials with match-influencing spells in less-than-favourable conditions for the spinners. When PBKS put on a boundary-hitting exhibition in Ahmedabad, Sai Kishore produced a miserly effort of 3 for 30.On Wednesday, he foxed the RCB batters with variations, which included angles, speeds and type of deliveries. The one that caught everyone’s attention was the ‘carrom ball’ that he unleashed against Krunal Pandya, with the southpaw having no clue how to deal with it and handing a simple return catch.“To be relevant in T20 cricket, you have to keep evolving. I have been practising that ball for the last three years, but I had not bowled it anywhere. I was confident enough to bowl it in this IPL; I just went with my instinct. It is like a carrom ball, I get more dip on it. You can call it anything (laughs),” said Sai Kishore.Sai Sudharsan, the Tamil Nadu red-ball skipper’s statemate and a teammate at GT, hailed him for being a street-smart operator.“Off the field, I see the amount of effort he puts in and the preparation he does in terms of having tactical advantages over the batters. That is putting him ahead of the other bowlers. He understands the game and situation, he uses his speeds and angles accordingly. It is one of the strengths he has. That is why he is bowling the way he has been,” Sai Sudharsan said.“In this game (against RCB), Sai Kishore’s spell was the most important one because it was difficult facing the fast bowlers on this pitch. As batters, we try to maximise against the spinners (on such pitches). He was smart enough. He used the right speeds and angles,” he added.",Sai Kishore has been one of the best finger spinners in Indian domestic circuit.

LUCKNOW: Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) skipper Rishabh Pant and Mumbai Indians (MI) star Rohit Sharma will be under the scanner due to poor form when these two teams face off at the Ekana Stadium here on Friday.The lean patch of the two stalwarts has put more pressure on their respective teams, both of which have blown hot and cold and not really built any sort of winning momentum so far.LSG lost their first home game to Punjab Kings by eight wickets, being outplayed in all departments, while five-time champions Mumbai Indians have not really clicked so far this season, with just two points from three games.MI and LSG are sixth and seventh respectively on the points table, though Friday’s tie puts more pressure on Lucknow since it is another ‘home’ game, even though any sort of help from the surface hasn’t been forthcoming yet, leading to controversy.MI, meanwhile, beat Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) in their own backyard and will be relatively upbeat. It’s Rohit’s lack of runs at the top of the order, though, that may have them in a quandary.The former MI skipper seems reluctant to give himself any sort of time to gauge the surface or settle in, which has invariably led to the fall of an early wicket. Meanwhile, Pant, the costliest player in IPL history, has just 17 runs from three matches.Pant will be concerned about the runs not flowing from his blade ahead of a busy season. He has scores of 0, 15 and 2 in the three games so far and the ‘honeymoon period’ with a new franchise may soon run out.The good news for the LSG skipper is that the team's depleted pace attack now wears a much-improved look with Avesh Khan joining the team against SRH and Akash Deep slated to play Friday’s game.The prospect of some explosive batting from Nicholas Pooran (LSG) and Suryakumar Yadav (MI), though, will please the fans.","LSG lost their first home game to Punjab Kings by eight wickets.

BENGALURU: It was a glorious return to the M Chinnaswamy Stadium for Mohammed Siraj on Wednesday night. The venue had been his IPL ‘home’ for the past seven seasons with Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB), until the franchise unceremoniously let go of the star pacer at the mega auction last year. Added to that snub was the hurt of being kept out of Team India’s white-ball scheme of things — he was ignored for the Champions Trophy recently — and no wonder Siraj was itching to unleash his trademark ‘Siu’ celebration here at the venue in Gujarat Titans colours.In the past, the celebration — inspired by his favourite footballer Cristiano Ronaldo — would often drown in the stadium’s din. On Wednesday, after his dismissal of Phil Salt, his chant reverberated around the Chinnaswamy, stunning the crowd into silence as the 31-year-old ripped through the RCB top-order.It was the perfect riposte to not only his old franchise but those who have doubted his credentials in the shorter formats. Siraj’s underwhelming performance (an economy rate of 8.81) at this venue was said to be one of the reasons he had to seek a new home with Gujarat Titans.Wednesday’s 3/19 showed he had reinvented himself, and the effort even earned praise from RCB’s head coach Andy Flower.“He bowled an outstanding spell with the new ball. His lines were really tight, his lengths were good and he threatened the stumps a lot. So, good on him,” Flower said.Flower’s assessment reflects Siraj’s growth as a white-ball bowler. He hasn’t donned the Indian colours in limited-overs formats for more than seven months now but that hasn’t stopped him from knocking on the door.Having started this IPL season on the wrong foot (0/54) against Punjab Kings, Siraj made amends when his team took on Mumbai Indians (2/34) before breathing fire against his former team -- RCB.At the Chinnaswamy, which has a benign batting pitch that is unforgiving of even marginal errors, Siraj more than held his own. Barring a boundary by Virat Kohli and a Phil Salt six , both coming in the Powerplay, there weren’t any loose deliveries from the Hyderabadi. The only blip was a wide he bowled in the 19th over.The fitter and fierier Siraj, dwelling on his second coming, said, “I had been playing consistently, but during the break I corrected my mistakes and worked on my fitness. Once I was picked up by Gujarat Titans, I spoke to Ashish bhai (Nehra, former India bowler and GT coach). He told me to go enjoy my bowling and Ishu bhai (Ishant Sharma) told me what line and length to bowl. My mindset is to have belief, and then the pitch does not matter.”",Mohammed Siraj returned to the M Chinnaswamy Stadium for the first time.

NEW DELHI: Kolkata Knight Riders ’ (KKR) batting all-rounder Venkatesh Iyer once again proved to be Sunrisers Hyderabad ’s (SRH) nemesis, smashing his third consecutive half-century against them in the IPL. The left-hander’s 60 off just 29 balls at Eden Gardens on Thursday helped KKR post a competitive 200/6 in their IPL 2025 clash.With this innings, Iyer joined an elite list of batters who have scored three or more consecutive fifties against SRH in the IPL.

His latest knock was a blistering display of stroke play that gave KKR a strong foundation.Reflecting on his innings during the mid-innings chat, Iyer acknowledged the challenging conditions: ""It was evident that the ball was holding up a bit, not the Eden I have played over the last two years. I think this is a very competitive score. If we bowl and field well, we should win this.""He credited his teammates for setting up the platform: ""I was watching the match from the screen, it wasn’t easy to play shots. The ball was holding a bit, but Ajinkya (Rahane) and Angkrish (Raghuvanshi) were really good to set up the innings for us.""Iyer also highlighted the impact of domestic cricket on players' development: ""It helps a lot that the BCCI has made it mandatory for everyone to play domestic cricket. It gives us a good chance of playing against quality bowlers, and you've seen so many bowlers coming around. It’s very challenging playing against them.""KKR’s total of 200/6 was built on Iyer’s explosive knock, along with contributions from Ajinkya Rahane (38), Angkrish Raghuvanshi (50), and Rinku Singh (32).",Venkatesh Iyer scores third consecutive half-century against Sunrisers Hyderabad.

New Zealand's 84-run win over Pakistan in the second ODI in Hamilton on Tuesday gave the hosts an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series, thanks to wicketkeeper-batter Mitchell Hay 's unbeaten 99 and a five-wicket haul by pacer Ben Sears .Hay was unlucky to miss a century by just a solitary run, but his 78-ball blitz helped New Zealand put up a challenging 292 for 8 on the board, after which Sears led the bowling charge with a spell of 5 for 59 that saw Pakistan getting bowled out for 208 in 41.2 overs.New Zealand had won the first ODI by 73 runs.Hay's knock rescued the Kiwis from a mid-innings bother, as the wicketkeeper-batter struck 7 fours and as many sixes, having arrived at the crease when New Zealand were at a precarious 132 for 5 in the 27th over.Pakistan's response faltered early when Will O'Rourke had Abdullah Shafique (1) caught at first slip in the third over, followed by Babar Azam (1) being caught at second slip off Jacob Duffy in the subsequent over.In his next over, Duffy claimed Imam-ul-Haq's (3) wicket. Pakistan were 9 for 3 in the sixth over and Sears made it worse for the visitors, dismissing both Salman Agha (9) and Mohammad Rizwan (5) in his first over to make it 32 for 5 in 12 overs.Tayyab Tahir (13) and Faheem Ashraf collaborated for a 33-run sixth-wicket partnership before Tahir was sent back by Nathan Smith. After Haris Rauf retired hurt on 3, his concussion substitute Naseem Shah joined Ashraf to build a 60-run stand.Both scored their maiden half-centuries, with Ashraf accumulating 73 from 80 balls while Naseem contributed 51 off 44 deliveries.Earlier, under overcast conditions and with a green-tinged pitch favouring bowling, Pakistan captain Rizwan elected to field after winning the toss. But Nick Kelly and Rhys Mariu started confidently despite their lack of experience.Their partnership reached 54 runs before Kelly, playing just his second international match, edged Rauf to be caught behind for 31, including 4 fours and 2 sixes.Making his first appearance, Mariu departed for 18 runs from 25 deliveries, offering a simple catch to Azam at mid-off from Wasim's first over.The bowling pair of Wasim and Rauf restricted the run flow effectively, with Henry Nicholls and Daryl Mitchell requiring until the 16th over to help New Zealand reach 100.When spin was introduced, Mitchell's innings concluded at 18 runs as Rizwan completed a stumping off Sufiyan Muqeem's delivery. Nicholls followed in the subsequent over, departing for 22.Bracewell and Abbas managed a modest 30-run partnership spanning 10 overs before Wasim dismissed Bracewell, who was caught behind after scoring 17.Abbas, who was born in Pakistan, formed a steady partnership of 77 runs with Hay, until he departed after scoring 41.Among the Pakistan bowlers, Muqeem delivered the best performance with figures of 2 for 33, while Wasim finished with 2 for 78.",New Zealand beat Pakistan by 84 runs to take 2-0 lead in three-match series. Mitchell Hay scores unbeaten 99 in second ODI in Hamilton. Pacer Ben Sears takes five-wicket haul as Pakistan bowled out for 208 in 41.2 overs.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119899456,imgsize-67974,width-400,resizemode-4/Nz.jpg"

IPL 2025 | Kagiso Rabada: 'Even a No. 10 can hit a six... there's no mystery anymore'

NEW DELHI: The Rs 27 crore tag seems to be continuously haunting star wicketkeeper Rishabh Pant . With two defeats in three matches, Lucknow Super Giants are already under fire, and Pant is bearing the brunt. The LSG captain's repeated failures in IPL 2025—both with the bat and in leadership—have become a hot topic.LSG have two points from three games and are sixth in the points table. Pant has scored 0 against Delhi Capitals, 15 against Sunrisers Hyderabad, and 2 against Punjab Kings , and his poor form has put him under immense pressure.Former India spinner Harbhajan Singh has suggested that LSG find a solution as soon as possible to address their Pant conundrum. Harbhajan termed Pant a ""huge shock"" for the LSG side.""Rishabh Pant wasn't able to do much. His bat has been quiet. They will have to do something about him getting out early. He has been a big shock for the team,"" he said on his YouTube channel.Also See: RCB vs GT, IPL 2025 Live Score Barring Nicholas Pooran's 44 and Ayush Badoni 's 41, LSG batters struggled in the match against Punjab Kings.LSG were restricted to 171/7, thanks to Arshdeep Singh's three-wicket burst, and their bowlers failed to stop Punjab Kings batters during the chase. Punjab Kings reached the target with ease in just 16.2 overs.Half-centuries from Shreyas Iyer and Prabhsimran Singh helped Punjab Kings secure their second consecutive victory in the competition.""LSG got stuck. After losing the toss, they didn't score many runs and disappointed themselves. Nicholas Pooran played brilliantly, but he was trapped by Yuzvendra Chahal. So when Pooran got out, LSG's back was pretty much broken. Ayush Badoni and Abdul Samad provided some fireworks towards the end and got them to a total that was worth fighting for, but very tough to defend given just how strong Punjab's batting is,"" added Harbhajan.",Rishabh Pant has scored just two runs in three matches for Lucknow Super Giants.

NEW DELHI: Rohit Sharma shared insights on how his role has evolved over the years within the Mumbai Indians setup, from adapting to new responsibilities to leading the team to multiple titles. He acknowledged that while a lot has changed since he started, his passion and desire to win games and trophies for the franchise remain the same.Rohit has endured his worst IPL start since 2020. He has struggled to find form in the first three matches of IPL 2025 , beginning with a duck in the campaign opener against Chennai Super Kings.He failed again against Gujarat Titans, scoring only 8 runs in MI’s 36-run defeat on Saturday, followed by 13 runs in the match against Kolkata Knight Riders, where he came in as an Impact Sub.""Since I started, things have obviously changed. I used to bat in the middle order; now, I open the innings. I was the captain; now, I’m not. Some of my teammates from our championship-winning seasons are now in coaching roles. So, roles have changed, a lot has changed, but mindset remains the same.""What I want to do for this team has not changed, and that is to go out there and win games and trophies.

Royal Challengers Bengaluru ( RCB ) will open their home account at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium tonight (April 2) against Gujarat Titans ( GT ).Though the Women’s Premier League (WPL) wrapped up three weeks ago, the ongoing heat and dryness have left the pitches looking browner than usual.RCB, coming off two consecutive wins to start the season, won’t mind this. Such a start has only occurred for the team twice before, in 2014 and 2021.In previous seasons, this notion of no home advantage could have affected RCB. However, this time may be different. Last year, they made a remarkable run to the playoffs, winning three out of their last six games at home consecutively.Also See: RCB vs GT, IPL Live Score 2025 Against the raucous crowd support for RCB, GT will need to explore various combinations. Should Jos Buttler open alongside Shubman Gill to enhance their powerplay?With David Miller not retained and Rahul Tewatia not in his prime hitting form, they risk over-relying on their top order. However, their bowling attack has the potential to deliver. Prasidh Krishna returns home, having played for Karnataka, and Mohammed Siraj returns to a venue that was his IPL home for seven years.Teams haven't dealt with much dew in the last two days. Regarding the pitch, Mo Bobat, RCB's director, anticipates a “typical Bengaluru pitch” that should produce plenty of runs.Notably, the 200-run mark wasn't surpassed in any of the seven knockout matches of the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20s held here in December. The same trend was observed in the seven WPL games, where spinners managed to take advantage of the surface.Royal Challengers Bengaluru probable XI: Virat Kohli, Phil Salt, Devdutt Padikkal, Rajat Patidar (c), Liam Livingstone, Jitesh Sharma (wk), Tim David, Krunal Pandya, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Josh Hazlewood, Yash Dayal.Impact Player: Suyash SharmaGujarat Titans probably XI: Shubman Gill (c), Jos Buttler (wk), Sai Sudharsan, Shahrukh Khan, Sherfane Rutherford, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Kagiso Rabada, R Sai Kishore, Mohammad Siraj, Prasidh Krishna.Impact Player: Ishant SharmaRoyal Challengers Bengaluru squad: Philip Salt, Virat Kohli, Devdutt Padikkal, Rajat Patidar(c), Liam Livingstone, Jitesh Sharma(w), Tim David, Krunal Pandya, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Josh Hazlewood, Yash Dayal, Suyash Sharma, Rasikh Dar Salam, Manoj Bhandage, Jacob Bethell, Swapnil Singh, Abhinandan Singh, Romario Shepherd, Lungi Ngidi, Nuwan Thushara, Mohit Rathee, Swastik Chikara.Gujarat Titans squad: Sai Sudharsan, Shubman Gill(c), Jos Buttler(w), Shahrukh Khan, Sherfane Rutherford, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Kagiso Rabada, Ravisrinivasan Sai Kishore, Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh Krishna, Ishant Sharma, Washington Sundar, Glenn Phillips, Anuj Rawat, Mahipal Lomror, Arshad Khan, Jayant Yadav, Nishant Sindhu, Kulwant Khejroliya, Gerald Coetzee, Manav Suthar, Kumar Kushagra, Gurnoor Brar, Karim Janat.Matches played: 5Royal Challengers Bengaluru won: 3Gujarat Titans won: 2Last match: Royal Challengers Bengaluru won by 9 wickets (2024)RCB have three wins out of five against GT but their record at home isn't the best.

Mumbai: In a massive development, India's Test opener Yashasvi Jaiswal has decided to quit Mumbai and move to Goa. The 23-year-old will captain Goa in the 2025-26 season.On Wednesday, Jaiswal wrote an email to the Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) seeking a No Objection Certificate (NOC) to change his cricket state team from Mumbai to Goa from the next season onwards. The MCA subsequently granted him the NOC.“He wrote an e-mail to us, seeking an NOC from the MCA to represent Goa next season. We’ve accepted his request,” Abhay Hadap MCA secretary told TOI.In his email to the MCA seeking transfer to Goa from Mumbai, Jaiswal communicated, ""I have had the privilege of representing Mumbai in domestic cricket and have immensely benefited from the opportunities provided by the association. However, after careful consideration of my career aspirations and personal circumstances, I have decided to seek a transfer to Goa to continue my domestic cricket journey. I assure you that this decision is made in good faith and with due respect to the association that has supported my development. I am willing to comply with all necessary formalities as per the BCCI’s player transfer regulations and will ensure a smooth transition.""""Thank you for your support and guidance throughout my time with Mumbai. I sincerely appreciate all the opportunities given to me and hope to maintain a positive relationship with the association in the future.""Also See: IPL Live Score, RCB vs GT Meanwhile, BCCI joint secretary Rohan Desai, who was the secretary of the Goa Cricket Association till recently, told TOI, “It’s a great development for Goan cricket. Goa’s cricketers, especially the youngsters, will get to learn a lot from Jaiswal , who is a part of India’s Test team. It’s a blessing in disguise that a player of his stature will be a part of Goa’s dressing room. It’s a good decision by the GCA management, especially Shambha Desai, the secretary of the GCA to include Yashasvi in the squad. I’m looking forward to an exciting season for Goa.”Jaiswal made his first-class debut for Mumbai at the Wankhede Stadium in January 2019 against Chhattisgarh in a Ranji Trophy match, and has scored a majority of his 3712 first-class runs, including 12 hundreds and 12 fifties, in 36 matches for Mumbai. It was his sizzling performances for Mumbai that brought the dashing left-hander into the national reckoning.In October 2019, Jaiswal became the youngest man to hit a one-day double century, when, at the age of just 17, he smashed 203 off 154 balls against Jharkhand in the Vijay Hazare Trophy. In June 2022, the left-hander stroked twin hundreds (100 & 181) against Uttar Pradesh in the Ranji Trophy, and didn’t look back.In recent years, Mumbai players like Arjun Tendulkar, Siddhesh Lad, Kshemal Waingankar and Eknath Kerkar have played for Goa.After the BCCI’s directive to the players to turn out for their state teams in domestic cricket, Jaiswal played in a Ranji Trophy match for Mumbai in the Ranji Trophy in the 2024-25 season, scoring 4 & 26 in the five-wicket defeat to Jammu & Kashmir at the MCA ground in BKC in Mumbai in Jan this year. Left out of India’s Champions Trophy squad but included in the list of non-travelling substitutes, the left-hander was drafted into the Mumbai Ranji squad ahead of their semifinal clash with Vidarbha in Nagpur on February 17. However, he had to pull out of the match just a day before the game due to pain in his ankle.Even though he belongs to the Bhadohi village in Uttar Pradesh, Jaiswal has a deep emotional connection with Mumbai, where he has played all his cricket till now in life. As a kid, he used to sleep in the Muslim United SC tent at the Azad Maidan and sometimes sell panipuris in the evening to make a living, before his childhood coach/mentor Jwala Singh took him to his home in Santa Cruz. In 2015, former India skipper Dilip Vengsarkar took Jaiswal to the UK for an exposure tour with his academy team. Jaiswal first attracted attention by making huge scores for the Rizvi Springfield School in the Harris Shield (inter-school competition for Under-16), and then did well for the Mumbai Under-16, Under-19 and Under-23 teams, before being picked for the Mumbai senior team.Jaiswal has currently been struggling for form while playing for the Rajasthan Royals in IPL-2025, where he has managed to score only 34 runs in three matches@11.33, with a strike rate of 106.25. The youngster was one of the standout performers for India in the 2024-25 Border-Gavaskar Trophy, where he scored 391 runs in five Tests@43.44, with one century and two half-centuries.",India's Test opener Yashasvi Jaiswal has decided to quit Mumbai and move to Goa.

After a perfect start of 2/2 wins, led from the front by their new captain Shreyas Iyer , there's no doubt now that the Punjab Kings played a masterstroke by acquiring the service of Shreyas at the IPL mega auction last November. The INR 26.75 crore they spent on the batter could well prove to be worth every penny. However, there's still a long way to go, but the team's new coach Ricky Ponting has full faith in Shreyas, who the Australian calls ' Rolls Royce '.Punjab defeated Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) by eight wickets on Monday to build on their 11-run opening win of the season against Gujarat Titans. In both the victories, Shreyas played a key role, scoring 97 not out off 42 balls against Lucknow and a 30-ball 52 not out against Gujarat.After the win on Monday, Ponting praised Shreyas for his consistency, comparing his control and finesse on the crease to the luxury car 'Rolls Royce'.""Skipper (Iyer) did it easy again. Rolls-Royce just stayed in third gear for most of the day. Didn't have to go any harder than that. Just steers the ship home. You haven't got an average yet,"" Ponting said about the Punjab skipper, who is yet to be dismissed.The Australian legend emphasised the importance of sustained dedication from his team members throughout the demanding season that lasts over two months. The final is scheduled for May 25.""Let's not take anything for granted with anything we're doing. Our attitudes have been spot on. We're just starting to scratch the surface. So let's keep working hard together as a family, as one. And we're going to get better every day,"" he added.The Punjab Kings bowlers demonstrated exceptional control from the beginning, which proved instrumental in restricting the hosts. Ponting acknowledged that this disciplined bowling approach was a crucial factor in determining the match's outcome.""Bowling first today, Arshdeep's (Singh) first over goes for three, Lockie (Ferguson) backs it up with an over, goes for four (runs). Two overs in the powerplay 1 for 7. We get through the powerplay, 3 for 35. Four of the overs in power play only went for 13 runs. So in the fifth over, Maxi (Glenn Maxwell) comes on and then on the back of that, Marco (Jansen). So, Marco bowls the sixth over. He absolutely means it. He ended up with the big wicket of David Miller,"" Ponting recalled, praising the team's focus.""The pleasing thing for me about a lot of the things that are happening around the group, it's when guys are coming in and playing their first game or getting their first opportunity; Lockie was the same today,"" Ponting analysed.Punjab's chase was spearheaded by opener Prabhsimran Singh, who deflated the LSG bowlers with a flurry of boundaries and ended up scoring 69 off 34 balls, including 9 fours and 3 sixes. It laid the foundation for Shreyas and Nehal Wadhera (43 not out off 25 balls) to play their natural game and take the team home.""Prabhsimran, I think you have learned a lot about yourself this week as well. I think you've proved to everyone just what a class act you are,"" said Ponting, before switching to praising Wadhera's knock.""We talk about players making an impact, right? You get an opportunity in a T20 game and it's all about making an impact on the game and on the contest when you can. He (Wadhera) only packed one shirt in his bag because he didn't think he was going to be taking much part in the game. He fields the last four overs and then I tap him on the shoulder. When I saw that they'd (LSG) made their impact sub as a left-arm off spinner, I said, 'mate, you're going in'.""","Punjab defeated Lucknow Super Giants by eight wickets on Monday to build on their 11-run opening win of the season against Gujarat Titans. In both the victories, Shreyas played a key role, scoring 97 not out off 42 balls against Lucknow and a 30-ball 52 not out against Gujarat.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119902223,imgsize-40860,width-400,resizemode-4/Shreyas-bcci.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Jasprit Bumrah ’s return to competitive cricket may take a little longer. It is understood that he is yet to bowl full tilt at the BCCI’s Centre of Excellence (CoE). Pacer Akash Deep’s comeback, too, has been pushed back by at least a week.TOI has learnt that Bumrah is clinically fit, but his workload is being increased gradually since he is at risk of suffering a stress fracture of the back. Even Akash Deep is nursing a back injury. Both pacers have not played any competitive cricket since the tour of Australia. While Bumrah suffered a lower back injury during the middle of the Syndey Test in the first week of January, Akash Deep couldn’t make it to the XI after developing some “discomfort”.The BCCI medical team has decided to tread very cautiously with Bumrah, given India are slated to play five Tests in England immediately after the IPL . As it is, the national selectors and the team management are not banking on Bumrah to play all five Tests.Also See: GT vs RCB Live Score, IPL 2025 “Bumrah’s injury is a bit more serious. The medical team wants to ensure he doesn’t suffer a stress fracture. Bumrah himself is being careful. He is bowling at the CoE but it could take longer to get back in full swing. No definite timeline has been set yet, but one hopes he gets back by mid-April. Akash Deep too hopes to get back by April 10,” a BCCI source said.Bumrah was initially expected to join Mumbai Indians by April 1.Meanwhile, Lucknow Super Giants pacer Mayank Yadav is also on the same timeline as Akash Deep and Bumrah. According to the refreshed standard operating procedure, the bowling coach at the CoE will have to give the final clearance. While the medical team decides if the player if fit enough to endure the rigours of high-performance sport, the bowling coach must decide if he is ready to go once he leaves the CoE.","Jasprit Bumrah is yet to bowl full tilt at the BCCI’s Centre of Excellence.

Good to see the way Indian fans encourage women cricketers: Deandra Dottin,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/good-to-see-the-way-indian-fans-encourage-women-cricketers-deandra-dottin/articleshow/119952876.cms,"Deandra Dottin

‘Pressure never bothers me; I play my natural game’

Deandra Dottin , one of the superstars in women’s cricket, was in Vadodara recently to play for Gujarat Giants in a women’s cricket league. The West Indian all-rounder, who was the first woman cricketer to score a century in T20 internationals, tells us, “I thoroughly enjoyed playing at the Baroda Cricket Association (BCA) stadium in Kotambi, where the facilities were excellent. Also, it is good to see the way Indian fans encourage women cricketers. It’s fantastic to see that women’s cricket has evolved so much since the time I started playing the game. Finally, it is getting the kind of attention it deserves and people are coming to the stadium to watch our matches. What more can a professional cricketer ask for? When fans come to watch you play and your matches are televised, you feel that you deserve to be here. There is no better feeling than that!”She adds, “During our stay in Vadodara, we visited the Laxmi Vilas Palace and had a nice conversation with Radhikaraje Gaekwad from the Baroda royal family. I quite liked the city. What I love the most about India is that no matter which city you travel to, people make you feel welcomed. Although I am a big foodie, I find Indian food a bit spicy. No chillies for me (laughs), but I manage to find non-spicy food too.”Deandra, who landed a ₹1.70 crore deal at the auction for the league, has often been compared to Chris Gayle for their similar playing styles. And while Gayle calls himself Universe Boss, Deandra calls herself World Boss. Asked about it, she laughs, “I gave myself that name and it’s pretty nice, isn’t it? Before I took up cricket professionally, I used to represent Barbados in athletics, especially javelin throw and shot put. I was doing pretty well and creating new records in athletics. That’s how that name came about (smiles). However, there came a time when schedules of athletics and cricket were clashing, and I had to choose one. It has been a wonderful journey.”Asked about coping with the pressure of expectations and comparisons with Gayle, she says, “I enjoy performing under pressure and it doesn’t really bother me. I just play my natural game and trust my ability.”",Deandra Dottin was in Vadodara recently to play for Gujarat Giants in a women's cricket league.
