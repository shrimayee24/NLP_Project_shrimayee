It was DLTGH 50 (days left to go home) at National Defence Academy (NDA). Morning announcements at squadrons were now beginning with this cheerful count. Mid-term had passed. Termbreak — and home — were only a few weeks away when the Oct 10 morning muster in Charlie Squadron reported a missing firsttermer, Cadet Antriksh Kumar Singh.The 18-year-old was found dead in his cabin. It was the third suicide in NDA since 2014. The Lucknow boy had cleared Services Selection Board (SSB) in his first attempt and was by all accounts a very bright student. What drove him beyond the edge?Less than two weeks later, tragedy struck again. This time in the swimming pool. Bravo Squadron first-termer Aditya D Yadav, a weak swimmer, was being put through extra lessons to clear his mandatory test when he drowned.Just how he died in the presence of six instructors, other cadets and officers is not known yet.Police investigations are on into both incidents. NDA is holding a court of inquiry. Both families have alleged a conspiracy and demanded ‘impartial investigations’.The back-to-back deaths at India’s premier military academy have triggered a deep introspection within defence and training circles about SSB, the training regimen and the psychological resilience expected of boys and girls fresh out of school.Selection for NDA is one of the most gruelling in the world — some 6 lakh sign up for just 406 seats. After clearing a UPSC written exam, candidates have to undergo an SSB interview process that lasts four days for those that clear screening. Then, there are medical tests. It’s after this multi-layered filtering that cadets earn the right to wear the Ashoka emblem on their NDA beret.Then comes training. Often, night merges into sleepless night after the day’s soul-sapping ‘ ragda ’ for first-termers. “Forget the drill square or PT grounds, merely surviving from reveille to lights-out in the squadron was a challenge in my ‘ Ikki ’ (first-termer) days,” recalled an NDA alumnus, who later joined as an instructor. “The process of forging boys into soldiers needs to be hard on mind and body. Unfortunately, sometimes tragedies happen. My heart goes out to the families of these cadets.”While the two deaths occurred under different circumstances, they are an indication of the immense adjustment pressures first-term cadets face.There have been nine deaths at NDA in the last two decades, three of them suicides. Cadets quitting training is also a major concern. A 2018 news report, quoting a report jointly prepared by Integrated Defence Staff Headquarters and NDA, revealed that between Jan 2008 and Nov 2017, as many as 1,256 cadets quit NDA, or a good 16-20% of intake every year.So, what’s going wrong?spoke to former SSB assessors, NDA instructors and former commandants and deputy commandants and a common voice emerged: the need to introduce systemic reforms that can ensure cadet safety without compromising on toughness.A consensus among several former SSB presidents and instructors is that the problem begins much before cadets even reach NDA. They point out that while the SSB process rigorously tests the mental makeup of a candidate, there is a need for a more uniform and scientific physical assessment system during the selection process itself.Candidates who fare poorly on the individual obstacle course may still get recommended if they are found fit otherwise — but the physical weakness shows up in NDA’s gruelling pace. Many candidates can’t cope with the sheer physical demands and drop out or get injured or worse.On Feb 11, 2022, defence minister Rajnath Singh informed Lok Sabha that 211 cadets had been discharged from NDA, IMA (Indian Military Academy in Dehradun) and OTA (Officers Training Academy, in Chennai and Gaya) in the previous 10 years as disabled and medically unfit for service.Experts suggest that like soldier recruitment rallies, a standardised physical test — based on measurable, uniform parameters — should be introduced for officer aspirants as well. Additionally, they recommend that cadets undergo comprehensive physical fitness assessments upon reporting to NDA.“Without a scientific baseline, how can the academy know if a cadet has weak leg muscles or poor endurance?” asked a retired physical training officer. “Instead of asking a new cadet to run a few kilometres within days of joining, the academy should build endurance gradually. Those who fail to meet standards after progressive training can then be screened out,” he suggested.“The individual obstacle test at SSB includes activities like ‘Tarzan jump’, vertical rope climbing or Burma bridge-crossing — things most civilian students have never done. Candidates from non-military schools find this difficult because it’s completely new to them,” said Brigadier Laxmicharan Patnaik, former president of an SSB centre.Brigadier Jay Konnur, former president of SSB Centre-Bangalore, acknowledged that physical standards often receive less attention during selection.“Candidates are asked to complete 10 obstacles in three minutes. We observe determination, not absolute physical capability. If a candidate manages even six, we tend to overlook the shortfall. That may not reflect the actual physical preparedness required for NDA training,” he said, adding that SSB’s focus on leadership and group dynamics often overshadows baseline fitness.“Once they reach NDA, every shortcoming becomes magnified in a far more demanding environment,” he pointed out.They are equally vocal about the need for improved and sustained psychological evaluations. “Psychological tests at SSBs are not foolproof,” said Patnaik, who was also chairman of Odisha Public Service Commission. “Repeated and deeper assessments at the academy are essential.”He feels NDA should appoint a dedicated team of psychologists to conduct regular evaluations and build a psychological dossier for each cadet.“These young men are future leaders of the armed forces. Understanding their emotional and mental resilience early can prevent breakdowns later,” Patnaik pointed out, adding that psychological counselling should be made a “normal and de-stigmatised part” of cadet life. “If we normalise counselling, first-termers will open up more. Confidential sessions can help them regain confidence and adjust to the demanding environment,” he said.“Cadets from civilian backgrounds face a stunning culture shock in the first term. They are not accustomed to the regimentation, physical demands or the sheer mental toughness that’s asked of them,” said an NDA alumnus. The academy has a system of counselling but what it needs is professional counsellors, said another alumnus.According to Major General Shukla, former commandant of SSB centre-Bhopal, the problem is compounded by interpersonal challenges within squadrons.“First-term cadets are often under immense pressure to prove themselves. Some seniors, driven by tradition or competition, unintentionally humiliate or overburden them. Sensitising senior cadets about mentorship is essential. They must handhold, not intimidate,” he said, remarking that effective mentorship and emotional support from senior cadets can ease this transition provided it is guided and monitored by officers. “Else, the same system that is meant to help may break them,” he cautioned.The “buddy system” — where every fresher is mentored by a senior cadet (overstudy) — has come under sharp scrutiny after recent incidents. Several parents, including serving officers, allege the system often crosses ethical and physical boundaries.“There are cases where seniors ask juniors to perform dangerous activities in the name of maintaining squadron honour,” said a source. “A second-term cadet suffered serious neck injuries when a senior asked him to perform a dive roll — a test the senior himself had not passed. The case is under consideration and the injured cadet is likely to board out on medical grounds.”Antriksh’s parents have alleged that his overstudy ragged him relentlessly. That is yet to be borne out in the police probe.The ‘fauji’ father of a medically boarded-out cadet said, “Each squadron competes fiercely in swimming, cross-country, or equestrian events. Seniors push juniors to unrealistic limits to maintain their reputation. This is neither scientific nor fair. This practice needs to be stopped.”However, former NDA commandants defend the mentorship tradition, insisting that when implemented correctly, it helps cadets adapt to a tough environment.Lt Gen Asit Mistry (retd), a former NDA commandant, said, “The buddy system has existed for decades and works effectively. Senior cadets help newcomers cope with the rigours of training. It’s unclear what went wrong in these cases, but the concept is sound.”Another former commandant added, “There is no scope for ragging or unscientific practices. Each squadron has officers specifically responsible for cadet welfare, who personally monitor stress and morale. Deviations must be dealt with seriously.”Ex-NDAs fiercely defend the academy’s ethos, and its emphasis on physical and mental toughness, pointing out that the system has produced three Param Vir Chakras, 12 Ashoka Chakras, 32 Mahavir Chakras and 160 Vir Chakras.But officers have also acknowledged the existence of what they term “unscientific traditions” — informal endurance practices not sanctioned but culturally ingrained. “These sessions are not officially part of the training schedule. But they are often conducted by senior cadets in the name of toughening them up. It can lead to injuries or psychological breakdowns,” said a former physical training officer.Another veteran observed that while the intention may be to foster toughness, such practices must be replaced with structured, scientific endurance programmes. “We must stop romanticising suffering as character-building. A soldier’s resilience should be built through method, not shock,” he suggested.Another alumnus recalled his own early struggles: “In my first term, I felt completely out of place. I couldn’t meet the standards and thought of quitting. It was only in the third term that I regained confidence. The system is harsh — but it shouldn’t break you before it builds you.”An officer who was part of the TriServices Committee, which tried to reform practices at training academies in 2003, said barracks punishments are the reasons for suicides and should be stopped immediately. “Most armies have changed it. Punishments can be military-ways, but harassment during night or odd hours should end immediately,” he toldon the condition of anonymity. “The academy must evolve with the times,” said Major General Shukla. “We cannot afford to lose bright young minds to outdated systems. The goal is not to dilute training, but to make it safer, smarter, and more humane.”As the investigations into the two deaths continue, the hope is that the tragedy will become a catalyst for long-overdue change — one that ensures no more dreams are extinguished in the process of building the nation’s defenders.Far from the institutional debate lies the anguish of devastated families. Rubikumari Yadav, mother of first-termer Aditya Yadav, said her life has been shattered. “My son dreamed of serving the nation, and now I am left with nothing. The academy says there was no fault. Who is responsible for my son’s death then?” she asked.Antriksh’s family says he faced intense pressure and humiliation from a senior cadet. “He topped his school and was full of dreams,” said his uncle, A P Sengar. “But he couldn’t bear the pressure. This is not training — it’s trauma.”Reacting to the allegations levelled by Antriksh’s parents, then NDA commandant Vice-Admiral Gurcharan Singh told, “It is a regrettable incident. He was a good cadet and performing well. We are in touch with the family and extending all possible assistance. A court of inquiry has been ordered to ascertain the facts.”But that’s little consolation for Rubikumari. “At the end of the day, I lost my son — and they lost one of the nation’s best,” she said.| Cadet Aditya D Yadav dies during swimming session| Cadet Antriksh Kumar Singh dies by suicide| Gentleman Cadet S Balu dies during a swimming session| Gentleman Cadet Kumbhar Atharv Sambhaji dies during cross country run| Gentleman Cadet Umang Khar dies from a heat stroke| Cadet R Rabijith dies during training| Cadets follow a clear hierarchy within each squadron, ensuring continuous guidance.

GURGAON: A seven-year-old boy playing outside his house with his father was crushed to death by a car being driven by a teenager in Maruti Kunj on Friday evening.Witnesses recalled the sudden roar of a Maruti SX4 as it sped down the narrow lane and crashed into Yohan, a Class II student. The boy was dragged for almost 20 metres on the bonnet of the car before the 15-year-old driver slammed the brakes.“It all happened in a flash. The car was going too fast for a lane as narrow as this. We heard a loud thud and rushed out to see what had happened,” said a local resident.Yohan was the only son of Ashwani Kumar, a building materials supplier and his schoolteacher wife.Residents gathered at the scene, pulled the underage driver out of the vehicle and informed police. Yohan’s family rushed him to Artemis Hospital, but he had succumbed to injuries by then.The incident left the neighbourhood shocked. “Our children play here every day. We never imagined something like this could happen right at our doorstep,” said a neighbour.An FIR was registered at Bhondsi police station under sections 106 (causing death by negligence) and 281 (rash driving) of BNS. Preliminary probe revealed that the car was not registered in the name of the minor’s father, who works for a private company.“We are trying to find out the actual owner of the car,” said an officer, adding that the vehicle could have been recently purchased second hand without updating registration records.","Yohan was dragged for almost 20 metres on the bonnet of the car before the 15-year-old driver slammed the brakes.

Delhi Student Suicide Case: Massive Protest Outside School After Note Alleges Harassment By Teachers

NEW DELHI: Four teachers of St Columba's School, named in an FIR filed in connection with the suicide by Class X student Shourya Patil (16), were on Thursday suspended.""The matter is under investigation... In view of the seriousness of the allegations, the competent authority has decided to place you under suspension with immediate effect,"" the order said, adding the teachers ""must stay available for official communication, avoid visiting the school or interacting with students, staff or parents without written permission"".Shourya's family returned for his last rites to Sangli, Maharashtra, where his grandparents live. He was cremated at his ancestral village, Dhawaleshwar, in Vita tehsil.Speaking to TOI on the phone, Shourya's father, Pradip Patil, said: ""For the past six months, he kept telling us he was being singled out and targeted even for normal conversations, and that teachers were humiliating him. We were repeatedly called to school over very small issues, especially in the past four months.""Also read: How 'warning' over dance practice pushed St Columba's Class 10 student to the brink Days before the school vacations, Shourya had pleaded with his father to pull him out. His father had promised he would be shifted after the break. But the harassment was so relentless the teenager could no longer bear it, alleged his family.""His vacations were just 8-10 days away. After that, he only had to come for his pre-boards. We had assured him that once this was over, we would shift him to another school for the next two years.Because 20 internal marks are with the school, we didn't want to risk his board performance. We thought it was better not to create conflict with the teachers and just wait it out,"" he added.Patil described his son as charismatic and cheerful, someone who loved dancing and had recently represented the school at a competition just a month ago. ""We were planning a family trip to China after his board exams. It was his wish, everything was already planned,"" he said.The suicide note found in Shourya's bag stated that he was sorry and that his body parts should be donated to someone in need.

""My last wish is that action is taken against them, I don't want any other child to do something like me (sic),"" it said.A grief-stricken Patil said, ""Especially after reading his note — and I'm staying strong — we will not stop fighting for justice.""On Thursday, several parents, former students and family friends gathered in anger and grief. Copies of Shourya's handwritten suicide note were pasted outside the school gates and boundary walls, drawing crowds of parents who stopped to read his final words.Chandrashil Dhawan (35), a relative of the Patils at the protest, said, ""Several children have now told us they faced harassment from the same teachers. They were even planning to write everything down and go to the police.""He alleged Shourya had been threatened by teachers on the morning of the incident for not performing a dance because of a sprained ankle. He left through the back gate and never reached his pick-up point for his driver to find him. ""The next we heard,"" Dhawan said, ""was that he had jumped from the metro station.""Parents at the protest said the school's counsellors exist ""only on paper"" and students do not feel safe approaching them. Former students said the school must end what they described as a ""pick-and-point culture"" that singles out students repeatedly. Aditya Sagar (18), an alumnus, said, ""The school has counsellors, but students rarely approach them about teacher-related issues. They are all part of the same ecosystem, so it doesn't feel like a safe space to complain. ""A police team visited the school and interacted with the students.

How “Tweaker” Became a Cultural Phenomenon

GELO - Tweaker (Official Video)

Tweaker's Chart Domination and Viral Impact on Fans

How LiAngelo Ball Went From Basketball to Music Trailblazer

LiAngelo Ball’s transformation from overlooked basketball prospect to music industry headliner has officially reached a historic milestone. His debut single “Tweaker,” released under the stage name Gelo, has achieved platinum status - an achievement that puts him in the same conversation as heavyweight artists like Drake . For an athlete-turned-musician, this level of success is both unprecedented and culturally significant, signaling a genuine crossover moment that few have ever achieved.In addition to redefining LiAngelo's public persona, this achievement represents the pinnacle of a swift ascent that started in early 2025. LiAngelo, a musician who was frequently overshadowed by his brothers Lonzo and LaMelo Ball, has carved out a whole new path, demonstrating that his musical drive and artistic intuition were much more than a curiosity.Released in January 2025, “Tweaker” exploded online almost instantly. Its nostalgic, bouncy beat - powered by piano, organ keys, and lush synth pads - captured the spirit of early-2000s hip-hop. Paired with Gelo’s melodic, sing-song delivery and a catchy “whoa” hook reminiscent of Big Tymers-era anthems, the track resonated widely. Produced by Kunica and Glockie Cheez, the song painted a picture of luxury, swagger, and newfound fame, creating an irresistible vibe that appealed to both younger listeners and fans of classic hip-hop aesthetics.As the song became more popular in sports culture, its momentum increased even further. ""Tweaker"" spread far beyond the typical music circles when NBA and NFL clubs, such as the Detroit Lions, Chicago Bulls, and Cleveland Cavaliers, adopted it as a joyous anthem in locker rooms and warm-up exercises.The success of “Tweaker” eventually led to a massive $13 million record deal with Def Jam and Universal Music Group. The contract included an extraordinary $8 million guaranteed signing bonus—more than what many current NBA players earn annually. This landmark deal solidified Gelo’s credibility and marketability within the hip-hop and R&B world.Adding even more momentum, a high-profile remix featuring Lil Wayne elevated the track’s status, giving it a stamp of approval from one of rap’s most influential figures.“Tweaker” made history by reaching No. 1 on the US Rhythmic Billboard chart - an exceptional feat for a debut single from a former basketball player. The song sparked viral dance trends across social platforms and earned praise from artists like T-Pain, Lil Yachty, and Joe Budden. Its appeal spanned music, sports, and online culture, cementing LiAngelo Ball as 2025’s breakout music star.Before rising to prominence in the music industry, LiAngelo Ball spent years navigating the NBA G-League and international basketball leagues. Eventually, he gave up the sport entirely, a decision that was validated by his outstanding achievements. His debut album League of My Own, which was released in July 2025, showcased his growth as a musician and cemented his place in the industry.Also read: Angel Reese responds with 4-word message after her name is dragged into viral NBA courtside altercation More than just a personal triumph, LiAngelo Ball's platinum success for ""Tweaker"" is an impactful cultural event.

TPUSA Under Fire: Candace Owens Reveals 10 Lies After Charlie Kirk Shooting

Candace Owens explains the roles of Tyler Robinson and Lance Twiggs



Operation Mocking-Plane: The Charlie Kirk Plot Thickens. | Candace Ep 266





Candace Owens claims the story about the day Charlie Kirk was shot does not make sense to her. She shared her thoughts during Myron Gaines’ livestream, which was uploaded to YouTube on November 18, 2025. Owens said she has been looking into the case on her own, and from what she has seen, the clips and details shown to the public feel incomplete. She pointed out that the public has not seen the exact moment when the shot was fired, and only a short clip of a person running after the shooting was released.Owens also said that Tyler Robinson, the man accused of shooting Charlie Kirk, may not have played the role many people think. She claimed that his fingerprints were found on the gun but said they were not the only fingerprints present. She also said another person named Lance Twiggs might have had a bigger role that day. Candace Owens stressed that these are her claims based on what she has seen so far.During the livestream, Candace Owens explained what she believed what happened on the day Charlie Kirk was shot. She said she thinks the whole situation looked like a planned setup with many people involved, not just one person acting alone.Myron Gaines asked her why she thought the story felt wrong, and she said there were gaps that did not add up.Candace Owens said that in her view, Tyler Robinson’s only real link to the case was that his fingerprints were found on the gun. She said his prints were not the only prints and claimed that this detail was not openly talked about.She also said that she does not believe Tyler Robinson stepped onto the campus that day. According to her, his “job” was only to pick up clothes and drop them near a Dairy Queen and then near a cemetery.She then discussed Lance Twiggs, who she said was the partner of the accused shooter. Candace Owens claimed Lance Twiggs was “much more involved.” She said she did not think he fired the shot, but she believed he had a deeper part in the plan too.Candace Owens also pointed to a TMZ video from September 13. The video showed a person walking toward Utah Valley University hours before the Charlie Kirk shooting. The person wore a maroon shirt, black cap, light shorts, and sneakers. Owens said this person was not Robinson but Lance Twiggs. She said the body in the video did not match Robinson and used this to support her claim that different people had different roles.Candace Owens said these details made her believe the Charlie Kirk shooting used patsies who were each given small tasks so the plan looked bigger and more confusing.Also Read: Candace Owens Brings Attention To YouTuber Claim Of TPUSA Financial Delay Before Charlie Kirk Shooting","Candace Owens claims the story about the day Charlie Kirk was shot does not make sense to her.

Ciara believes Russell Wilson’s “fullness as a man” strengthens their relationship

Ciara’s Guide To Manifesting Convictions Into Reality | Angie Martinez IRL

Ciara and Russell Wilson have never shied away from expressing admiration for one another, but the singer’s latest reflections are offering fans one of the most intimate looks yet into their marriage. During a candid appearance on the “Angie Martinez IRL” podcast, Ciara spoke at length about the dynamic she shares with the New York Giants quarterback, especially their three-year age gap, something she says has only added depth to their connection.For Ciara, Wilson is not just younger on paper; he’s the emotional anchor in their marriage, someone whose “old soul” and grounded demeanor bring stability during the pressure-filled chaos of NFL life and fame.While discussing the early years of their relationship and the evolution of their bond, Ciara shared that Russell Wilson often feels more mature than she does, despite being younger. “I do like to live young,” she said. “And then obviously my husband’s younger than me too, so I gotta keep it here. He’s an old soul, to be honest with you, he might be a little more older than me.”She added, “Sometimes I feel his fullness as a man, and that feels good.”It’s a sentiment that mirrors what fans repeatedly see in their public exchanges; respect, partnership, and a deep emotional alignment.That admiration was on full display back in October when Ciara penned a heartfelt Instagram message thanking Wilson for a surprise birthday celebration. “Baby, thank you for always making me feel on top of the world and for throwing the best surprise birthday party!” she wrote. “You always make every moment for me, big or small, feel special and important! You are the best!! I love you soooooo much.”The couple continues to shrug off online chatter, including the long-running “corny” label directed at Wilson. Ciara addressed that narrative months earlier on “The Breakfast Club,” responding with grace and conviction. “Why would I even respond to that, you know what I’m saying?” she said. “[He’s] the most amazing human being you can know… What you see with him is really who he is. So, it’s beautiful, it’s different. ”As the pair publicly embraces discussions about expanding their family, one thing remains clear: Ciara sees Russell not just as her partner, but as the grounding force who brings consistency, love, and an unwavering sense of maturity into their life together.Also Read: Russell Wilson and Ciara celebrate a Hollywood milestone as their first major film breaks into the year’s top 100","Ciara revealed on the 'Angie Martinez IRL' podcast that her husband, Russell Wilson, acts as an emotional anchor in their marriage.

"Gisele Bündchen implied that prioritizing Tom Brady for years took a personal toll: “When you love someone, you don’t put them in jail”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/gisele-bndchen-implied-that-prioritizing-tom-brady-for-years-took-a-personal-toll-when-you-love-someone-you-dont-put-them-in-jail/articleshow/125033119.cms,"Supermodel Gisele Bündchen reflects on her marriage to Tom Brady, describing their split as a ""death and rebirth."" She details her shift from supporting his career to rediscovering her own dreams and personal fulfillment. Bündchen emphasizes that true success lies in authenticity and self-discovery, moving forward on her own terms.

Gisele Bündchen's shifting balance between support, career and self-fulfillment

Moving from high-stakes partnership to reinventing life on her own terms





In her March 2023 interview with Vanity Fair, supermodel Gisele Bündchen opened up about her 13-year marriage to former NFL quarterback Tom Brady, how their lives evolved, and what she discovered in the space that followed. While details of their split had played out in headlines, Bündchen offered fresh context and a more nuanced perspective.Gisele Bündchen admitted that the marriage was “like a death and a rebirth,” and described her own shift from supporting a partner’s career to rediscovering her personal dreams. Her reflections reveal not just a high-profile breakup, but a woman reclaiming her voice and defining success on her own terms.When Gisele Bündchen first met Tom Brady at age 26, she said she was, “so ready” for family and partnership. Traditionally one of the world’s highest-earning models, she gradually scaled back her runway work after 2015 to support the family life they were building..Gisele Bündchen describes relocating to Tampa without ever having lived there before, “When we moved to Tampa, I actually had never been there before.I just arrived and that was my life.” Yet despite her enormous success, much of the public narrative painted her as “against football” or overshadowed by Brady’s career, a portrayal she calls “very hurtful” and “the craziest thing I’ve ever heard.”Gisele Bündchen underscores that marriage didn’t unravel overnight. “That takes years to happen.” As she puts it, “Sometimes you grow together; sometimes you grow apart … When you love someone, you don’t put them in a jail and say, ‘You have to live this life.’ You set them free to be who they are..”Gisele Bündchen's message: supporting someone doesn’t mean losing yourself, and that truth became clearer to her as her kids grew and her dreams quietly changed..Today, Gisele Bündchen speaks of her next act in Costa Rica, building a home, raising her children, and exploring wellness and nature far from red carpets. She asserts, “I have my own dreams..”While Tom Brady continued his historic career, Bündchen’s focus shifted inward. She embraced spiritual practices, daily rituals, and the idea that success is not just professional acclaim but authenticity and fulfillment. She says the breakup felt like both a loss and a liberation, “I believed in fairy tales when I was a kid. I think it’s beautiful to believe in that.”Gisele Bündchen's reflection on Brady is remarkably gracious. “Listen, I have always cheered for him, and I would continue forever … If there’s one person I want to be the happiest in the world, it’s him.”In doing so, Gisele Bündchen rejects reductive headlines and stereotypes, choosing instead to present a fuller picture of love, change and self-discovery. As she said, “What’s been said is one piece of a much bigger puzzle. It’s not so black and white.”In the end, this isn’t a story solely of one of fashion’s biggest icons, Gisele Bündchen stepping aside. It’s the story of a woman stepping forward, redefining when a chapter ends, a new one begins..Also Read: Gisele Bündchen’s post divorce evolution raises question: did Tom Brady underestimate what letting her go would cost him?","Supermodel Gisele Bündchen opened up about her 13-year marriage to former NFL quarterback Tom Brady.

What initially appeared to be a pregnancy-related irregularity turned out to be acute myeloid leukemia linked to a rare mutation called Inversion 3.Doctors told Schlossberg that she could not be cured through standard treatment. She was informed she would need months of chemotherapy followed by a bone marrow transplant. Despite feeling healthy and active, she suddenly found herself facing a life-threatening condition.Schlossberg spent five weeks at Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital before transferring to Memorial Sloan Kettering, where she underwent extensive chemotherapy.

NHL Fantasy Waiver Wire picks for Nov. 22: Braeden Bowman tops this week’s must-add forwards,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/nhl-fantasy-waiver-wire-picks-for-nov-22-braeden-bowman-tops-this-weeks-must-add-forwards/articleshow/125509248.cms,"Braeden Bowman (Image Via Getty Images)

How Braeden Bowman, Adam Fantilli , and other emerging forwards are boosting their fantasy value

Must Add Players for Week 8! Best Schedules & Waiver Wire Targets Fantasy Hockey

The NHL fantasy waiver wire for the date of November 22 is bringing to light a new collection of fast-rising forwards, and the week’s breakthrough candidate is none other than Braeden Bowman, whose promotion to L1 and PP1 in Vegas has left the fantasy managers in a state of confusion. The following week, with the reshuffling of lines in the teams and the young talent being given bigger roles, is one of the best in the month for the forward's value pickups.Apart from Bowman, a number of mid-rostered players are now flourishing due to the upgraded deployments, better linemates, and a more consistent scoring pattern. References from THN Fantasy and The Hockey News reveal a number of forwards who are giving out far more than their roster percentage, thus making them excellent additions for managers needing instant offense.Braeden Bowman is the first name on the list after he registered his first career multi-point game, and he has gained significant playing time alongside Jack Eichel. Any forward with L1 and PP1 deployment in Las Vegas is a must-see, and especially the one that is already building chemistry with the team’s leading star.Adam Fantilli is certainly the next choice, having scored six goals in his last seven games and being set up as Columbus’s most dangerous forward among Kirill Marchenko and Dmitri Voronkov.His confidence, the way he is used, and his scoring touch all indicate that he has fantasy value for a long time.Kyle Palmieri has a safer, more consistent profile thanks to his L1 and PP1 role with Bo Horvat. The Blues continue to be one of the weakest defensive teams in the league, which means Palmieri has the perfect matchup and a high floor. Tyler Seguin is still reaping the benefits of playing alongside Jason Robertson, while Calgary’s penalty problems increase his chances for power-play points.Philipp Kurashev presents a volatile situation, but has great potential at the same time, as he plays alongside Macklin Celebrini and Will Smith. His scoring streak indicates he is part of the Sharks’ offensive crescendo, even though he is on the second power play unit.This week's waiver wire is a unique opportunity to acquire valuable forwards, with the likes of Bowman, Fantilli, and Palmieri—so it is an excellent moment to boost your fantasy team.Also Read: NHL trade rumors: Pavel Mintyukov buzz heats up as Canadiens Montreal explore their options","The NHL fantasy waiver wire for the date of November 22 is bringing to light a new collection of fast-rising forwards.

Ciara, Kelly Rowland & Lala Anthony: Red Flags, Signature Scents & Friendship | Level Up Radio

For Ciara and her circle of close friends, group chats are never dull, especially when Russell Wilson decides to show up in the middle of the discussion. The Giants quarterback often finds himself at the center of their conversations, not because he tries to lead them, but because he cannot resist joining in. On the latest episode of Apple Music’s Level Up Radio, Ciara sat with Kelly Rowland and La La Anthony and the trio let listeners in on what really happens behind the scenes. Their stories painted a lively picture of Wilson, who often slips into the chat with genuine curiosity and a sense of humor that keeps everyone entertained.The women shared lighthearted moments that revealed the quarterback’s playful and thoughtful side. Even as Wilson works through a difficult stretch in his NFL journey, it is clear that his role within Ciara’s trusted circle is as strong as ever. Their conversations showed how he blends fun with honest advice, something all three women value.Kelly Rowland set the tone by declaring, “Russ is nosy,” a comment that caused the group to burst into laughter. La La Anthony quickly backed her up, adding, “He’s all in my business.” According to them, Wilson will not hesitate to jump into a discussion with a direct question that catches everyone off guard. Rowland joked, “He will come in the middle of the conversation and [Ciara] is like, ‘Russ Russ Russ,’ and he just outright asks.Even with all the teasing, their remarks came from a place of affection. Anthony said she values Wilson’s honesty, especially when she needs guidance. “I love his input because sometimes you do need the male perspective. And he’s another one, he will check me,” she said. “He’ll be like, ‘Sis, this is what you’re doing wrong.’”Ciara agreed and explained how the dynamic works for all of them. “We always hold the girls down… Y’all have your own thing with Russ, so my point is if there is something that is love-related, not deep, I’ll be like, ‘Baby, we gotta check on our friends,’” she said. Anthony added that Ciara creates the space for boundaries, saying, “For me, you give me the space to share with him whatever I choose or whatever I don’t choose to share with him. ”Their bond continues even while Wilson navigates the ups and downs of his 14th NFL season. After being benched earlier this year, he remained committed to the team, saying, “I’m not done. I’ve got so much belief in myself and know what I can be capable of.” He followed that with another clear message of loyalty. “I want to be here. I love this organization. I love the guys in the locker room. I’m not giving up on us in this season,” he said.Through uncertainty, one thing stays steady. He is still the guy in the group chat who wants the tea, offers the truth, and brings everyone closer with his presence.Also Read: Brandon Aiyuk’s 49ers future hits shocking crossroads as contract concerns and injury fears spark exit whispers","Ciara sat with Kelly Rowland and La La Anthony on the latest episode of Apple Music’s Level Up Radio.

Fans long envisioned Swift as the music-powered mutant, citing her stage presence and pop icon status. While Carpenter offers a fresh take, Swift's connection to Dazzler remains a captivating 'what if' for many.

Taylor Swift’s name refuses to leave the Dazzler conversation





Pop culture fans are buzzing again and this time, Taylor Swift is right at the center of the conversation. Fresh reports suggesting Sabrina Carpenter has met with Marvel Studios about joining the MCU as Dazzler have reopened a debate that has been simmering for years: should Swift have been the one to bring the glittering, music-powered mutant to life?With Marvel’s long-anticipated X-Men reboot finally gaining shape, the resurfaced rumors feel less like idle chatter and more like a missed opportunity for Swifties who believed their superstar was destined for the role. Carpenter’s rising momentum makes her a natural fit, but the fascination with Swift as Dazzler remains unmatched, fueled by her global visibility, magnetic stage presence, and long-rumored connection to the character.Even as Sabrina Carpenter earns attention for reportedly stepping into Marvel’s orbit, Taylor Swift’s shadow looms large. The idea of Swift playing Dazzler became a fan obsession years ago, especially after Easter egg–hungry Marvel watchers connected her iconic pop persona to Alison Blaire’s disco-era flair.Swift has long embodied the kind of larger-than-life musical identity that made Dazzler more than just another mutant, she’s an entertainer first, a reluctant hero second. That duality mirrors Swift’s own evolution from country singer to global phenomenon, someone who commands stadiums yet fiercely protects her creative autonomy.The speculation only intensified after Swift appeared in Deadpool & Wolverine fan theories, with many convinced she would make a surprise MCU cameo.Although it never materialized, it showed how deeply fans associated the character with her. Dazzler’s signature ability, turning sound into shimmering bursts of light, felt almost too on-the-nose for Swift, whose concerts are already a choreographed explosion of music, color, and emotion.Carpenter, meanwhile, represents a newer generation of pop stardom, and her growing influence aligns neatly with Marvel’s push to refresh the X-Men for a modern audience. Her charm and performance style would certainly bring a youthful electricity to Alison Blaire. But Swift’s potential casting would have carried a sense of pop-culture inevitability, the merging of two massive fandoms at a pivotal moment in Marvel’s rebuilding era.If Carpenter does land the role, it will mark a major milestone in her career. Yet for many fans, the conversation will always return to Swift, because some MCU “what ifs” are simply too dazzling to forget.Also Read: “She doesn’t want to see him”: Taylor Swift refuses Joe Alwyn’s plea for closure as she happily moved on with Travis Kelce","Sabrina Carpenter reportedly met with Marvel Studios about joining the MCU as Dazzler.

This comment came years after their public feud, offering a glimpse into how public figures can move past old conflicts, even if their relationship remains distant.

Kim Kardashian once surprised fans by praising Taylor Swift’s “super cute and catchy” music

In late 2021, long before their names resurfaced in more recent cultural debates, Kim Kardashian made headlines for a reason no one expected: she openly praised Taylor Swift’s music. At the time, the comment stunned fans because it arrived years after the two had been locked in one of pop culture’s most public and polarizing feuds.Yet during a candid moment on the Honestly With Bari Weiss podcast, Kardashian didn’t hesitate to admit that she had plenty of Swift’s songs saved on her phone. It was an unexpected shift in tone that suggested, at least publicly, that some of the tension between the two megastars had eased, even if their complicated history still loomed large.During the rapid-fire portion of the interview, Kardashian was asked about some of her favorite albums. While she predictably mentioned Yeezus and My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy when discussing Ye’s catalog, she surprised the host when Taylor Swift’s name came up.Kim didn’t pick a specific album, but she didn’t downplay her appreciation either. “I mean, I really like a lot of her songs,” she said. “They’re all super cute and catchy.I’d have to look in my phone to get a name.”For fans who lived through the highly publicized fallout, from the infamous 2009 VMAs moment to the explosive controversy surrounding the edited 2016 phone call, hearing Kardashian speak so casually about enjoying Swift’s music felt almost surreal. At the time, Kim had already told Watch What Happens Live that the feud was “over,” even though the two stars still hadn’t spoken.Her 2021 podcast comments didn’t rewrite their history, but they did offer a small look at how public figures sometimes outgrow old conflicts, even when their disagreements once dominated global headlines. And while their relationship has remained distant, that simple acknowledgment that Swift’s songs were on her playlist showed a rare, human side of a long-running saga fans know all too well.Also Read: Kim Kardashian sparks new controversy with All’s Fair’s Taylor Swift–coded episode title as Travis Kelce stays out of the drama","Kim Kardashian said she enjoys Taylor Swift's ""super cute and catchy"" music.

Boston Red Sox Linked to Stunning Pursuit of a Two-Time Cy Young Winner

Tarik Skubal’s Dominance Makes Him a Game-Changing Target

The $400 Million Question

The Boston Red Sox appear ready to build on their long-awaited return to postseason baseball, and the early signs point toward an aggressive approach this offseason. After securing a playoff berth for the first time in years, the organization seems determined to turn a promising step forward into a championship-caliber leap. With optimism growing around the franchise, the team’s front office is now exploring ways to elevate its pitching staff to elite status.One major theme emerging from Boston’s offseason strategy is the pursuit of a high-end arm to pair with breakout ace Garrett Crochet. Crochet’s rise to becoming the Cy Young runner-up has shifted the Red Sox’s priorities, putting a spotlight on the need for a reliable and dominant No. 2 starter who can complement him at the top of the rotation.According to MLB speculation, Boston could find its ideal rotation partner in one of the league’s very best pitchers: Detroit Tigers superstar Tarik Skubal. Bleacher Report’s Zachary D. Rymer has suggested that the Boston Red Sox may target Skubal through a blockbuster trade, banking on his elite résumé to create a formidable 1–2 punch with Crochet.Rymer’s projection points to a potential scenario in which Detroit decides to leverage maximum value for its ace.Despite being in the midst of a competitive window, the Tigers might consider moving the two-time Cy Young Award winner now rather than risking losing him for nothing when his contract expires. The idea is that Detroit could land a massive return package featuring multiple top-100 prospects, along with either an MLB-ready frontline pitching prospect or an established No. 1 starter to reshape its 2026 rotation.Tarik Skubal’s 2024 season further cemented his position as one of baseball’s premier pitchers. He delivered a 13-6 record with a dazzling 2.21 ERA, racked up 241 strikeouts, and posted a 0.891 WHIP across 195 innings. His performance earned him a second straight Cy Young Award, placing him just ahead of Crochet in the voting.Pairing Skubal with Crochet would instantly transform the Boston Red Sox rotation into one of the most intimidating duos in MLB. But the path to making such a move is complex.For the trade to make sense, Boston must address the financial reality: Tarik Skubal carries a projected $400 million price tag as he approaches his final year under contract. Acquiring him as a one-year rental would require surrendering multiple top-100 prospects—an expensive gamble unless the Boston Red Sox secure him long-term.Also read: MLB trade rumors: New York Yankees could sign $426 million Angels superstar in blockbuster deal after Cody Bellinger opt-out If Boston is serious about building an elite pitching core, re-signing Tarik Skubal becomes essential.

WTC Final: Steve Smith on future, facing South Africa and revised format

Poll Who do you think won the battle of words between Monty Panesar and Steve Smith? Monty Panesar Steve Smith It's a tie

The first Test of the Ashes has begun with an unexpected off-field storm, as former England spinner Monty Panesar unleashed a blistering response to Australia's stand-in captain Steve Smith , escalating what has become the most unlikely feud of the series. Smith had earlier mocked Panesar's infamous Celebrity Mastermind appearance while reacting to the former cricketer's advice that England should needle the Australian skipper by resurrecting memories of the 2018 Sandpaper Gate scandal. The Australian star told reporters to “do yourself a favour” and watch Panesar's quiz-show errors — including mixing up Athens' location and calling America a city — calling it “pretty comical”.But Panesar struck back with ferocity in a Telegraph column, claiming he had “won the battle” and branding Smith's press-conference comments as proof of “mental vulnerability” ahead of a blockbuster series opener.“To think that he wanted to talk about me before one of the biggest days of his career… is flattering and nothing short of hilarious,” Panesar wrote. “I cannot believe he has dug out the old YouTube clip of my shocker and memorised it word by word.”Panesar conceded his Mastermind performance was “terrible” and “a shocker”, but insisted it was still preferable to Smith's own missteps. “We've both made mistakes, but at least mine was on a celebrity quiz show.His was on a cricket field, and we both have to live by them. It seems right now only one of us can.”The former spinner went further, saying if he ever confronted Smith, he would question whether the 36-year-old could “look himself in the mirror yet” after Cape Town 2018. “I would ask Steve whether he can actually admit he was part of Sandpapergate — the worst example of Australian cheating in history.”Panesar suggested Smith's reaction proved England had already succeeded in getting inside his head. “I am delighted to have got so far inside his mind… imagine how much damage Ben Stokes and his side are going to be able to do once play starts in Perth?”He even offered sledging scripts for England players: “If I was Jofra Archer, I'd be telling him ‘I'm swinging the ball even without sandpaper'; if I was Joe Root: ‘Fine or coarse paper, mate? Tell us the tricks of your trade.'”With both sides gearing up for the brutal on-field contest, the Panesar–Smith saga has added an unexpected psychological subplot to an already high-voltage Ashes opener.",Former England spinner Monty Panesar hits back at Steve Smith.

India batting coach Sitanshu Kotak shares key update on Shubman Gill's fitness ahead of second Test in Guwahati

NEW DELHI: India Test captain Shubman Gill has been released from the squad ahead of the Guwahati Test and has already left for Mumbai on Friday. The youngster travelled with the side on November 19 but didn't turn up for training on November 20. It is learnt that he will be resting in Mumbai for the next two-three days before seeking specialist opinion from Dr Dinshaw Pardiwala. As of now, there is no trip planned to the BCCI Centre of Excellence (CoE) and more clarity is expected in the coming days.In Gill's absence, Pant will lead the side in the crucial second Test vs South Africa starting November 22. The team management will have to take some tough Playing XI calls and as TimesofIndia.com had reported, Sai Sudharsan and Nitish Kumar Reddy are frontrunners to be picked with Axar Patel likely to return on the bench. In the training session on eve of the match, only KL Rahul, Yashasvi Jaiswal and Sudharsan turned up as the rest took it easy.India lost the first Test at the Eden Gardens inside three days and a lot of focus has been on the playing surface since then. While Eden wasn't the ideal surface, Guwahati is expected to roll out a red soil pitch which will offer both turn and bounce. It may not be as unplayable as Eden but will keep the spinners in play.India batting coach Sitanshu Kotak spoke at length about the pitch for the opening Test and felt it wasn't something they expected.""See, in the last match wicket, Gautam said that he took all the blame on himself. He said that he took the blame because he felt that he should not put the blame on the curators,"" Kotak said. ""Now, what happened in the last match, after a day, it felt like it was crumbling. There was a little bit of soil [that came up after the ball pitched]. All of you can see that. That was not expected. Even if the spin was expected, it was after 3 days or on the third day in the evening. Sometimes, the weather, sometimes, even the curators did not want it. I am telling you the truth. No one wanted it to be like this.""",India Test captain Shubman Gill has been released from the squad ahead of the Guwahati Test.

NEW DELHI: Sarfaraz Khan ’s continued absence from the Indian Test team has led to questions from several former players.

His highest score in Tests is 150.""I think there is a clarity issue in the case of Sarfaraz. I think it is a case of perception and understanding. I am trying to think—they might have a perception that he may not do as well in swinging conditions or play fast bowling well. Maybe he is not our guy in SENA countries. So he did not get the chance. But even to make that perception, I have to allow him to fail. He is not even being allowed to fail. And now there is no place in the team as well,"" Chopra said on Shubhankar Mishra's YouTube channel.Chopra added, ""I think Sarfaraz should play, or else it would be unfair.""Sarfaraz has also has had a difficult Ranji Trophy season so far, scoring 178 runs in five matches with one fifty.The right-hander batter’s returns are indeed low for the lofty standards he has set in the Ranji Trophy in the seasons preceding his India Test call-up.

Poll What do you think about Usman Khawaja being barred from starting the innings? Poor decision by the management Necessary for player safety Indifferent, it happens in cricket

Australia’s opening day of the Ashes took an unexpected turn when Usman Khawaja was barred from starting the innings.The opener, who had spent an extended period off the ground with stiffness, did not meet the minimum on-field requirement to bat.Stand-in captain Steve Smith tried to bring him back shortly before England’s innings ended, but the collapse came too quickly for the 38-year-old to regain eligibility.That forced a reshuffle, with Marnus Labuschagne walking out alongside debutant Jake Weatherald.Former Australia allrounder Tom Moody criticised the confusion on Fox Cricket, calling it “poor management… Beyond a joke… like Starc led the attack, we needed Uzzie [Khawaja] to lead the batting.”Weatherald’s debut lasted only two balls, trapped lbw by Jofra Archer after a review, leaving Smith to take strike much earlier than planned. Khawaja, still unable to bat because the dismissal came too soon after his return to the field, remained in the dressing room as Australia attempted to settle after the disruption.He finally came on after the wicket of Marnus Labuschagne in the 15th over, but only managed 2 runs and lasted just an over.The day had already swung violently before the batting order drama.Mitchell Starc demolished England with a fiery 7/58, ripping through the top order inside the first hour and returning after lunch to break the middle order.Only Harry Brook (52) and Ollie Pope (46) offered resistance as England were dismissed for 172, with debutant Brendan Doggett supporting Starc with 2/27.Australia’s reply was equally turbulent. England’s quicks hit back hard, led by captain Ben Stokes, who produced a six-over burst returning 5/23. Archer and Brydon Carse added two wickets each as Australia slid to 123/9 by stumps, still trailing by 49.Smith and Labuschagne held through the early storm, but England maintained pressure throughout the evening session.With the match finely balanced, both sides head into day two with the contest wide open.","Usman Khawaja did not meet the minimum on-field requirement to bat.

Why coach Gautam Gambhir can't continue with his IPL ways in Test cricket

India’s evolving approach to their batting order has once again raised eyebrows, with head coach Gautam Gambhir and the team management making another unexpected shuffle during the first Test against South Africa at Eden Gardens. In a move that surprised many, India fielded four frontline spinners and sent Washington Sundar in at number 3, a slot previously occupied by Sai Sudharsan in the West Indies series earlier this year. Before that, both Sudharsan and Karun Nair had been used at the same position during the tour of England.Former India batter Aakash Chopra voiced his concerns over the continuous reshuffling and questioned whether the team was lacking clarity in its long-term plans.“Washington Sundar has presented himself as a phenomenal option who can bat at the top of the order, and of course is a more than handy bowler. The bigger question that Gautam and the team management need to answer is are we going to keep changing goalposts after every series?” Chopra said during a JioStar media day interaction.Sudharsan, who made scores of 7, 87 and 39 against the West Indies, found himself out of the XI for the opening Test against South Africa. Sundar replaced him at number 3 and made 29 and 31 in the match.“You’re well within your rights to go with Washington, but if Washi is your long term choice, then were we just wasting time with Sai Sudharsan or even Karun Nair to bat at 3?” Chopra asked.He stressed that India’s top order must prioritise pure batting attributes above all else.“You would first want to prioritise the batting capabilities, not only the skill but also the temperament and the patience and the ability to bat time. That is why you look for the purest specialists who have only one job to do. Your top 4 or 5 are there just to bat and nothing else.”Chopra added that if Sundar is indeed being groomed primarily as a batter, the last several months of experimentation may have served little purpose.“If you choose Washington Sundar as a batter, fair enough, but it just feels like the last six or seven months were futile and you didn't really gain anything from it,” he said.He also questioned the messaging to Sudharsan, who performed reasonably well but still lost his place.“What message do you give to Sai Sudharsan that we gave you a chance, you scored the runs, but we had a change of heart. Transition gives you the chance to experiment, but what makes it easier is clarity and consistency,” Chopra concluded.",India's evolving approach to their batting order has once again raised eyebrows.

Why is the series called The Ashes?



What is inside the urn?



NEW DELHI: England and Australia are facing off in the opening Test of the 2025-26 Ashes series at the Optus Stadium in Perth, renewing one of cricket’s most iconic rivalries. The contest derives its famous name from a mock obituary printed in 1882 after Australia claimed their first Test win on English soil.For both nations, the Ashes series carries immense prestige, often regarded as being on par with the honour of winning a World Cup. Its name has a unique and storied origin rooted in cricket history.The term originated on August 29, 1882, when English journalist Reginald Shirley Brooks published a tongue-in-cheek obituary in the Sporting Times following England’s defeat at The Oval.""English cricket was dead and the body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia,"" Brooks wrote in the Sporting Times.England captain Ivo Bligh vowed to reclaim those “ashes” during the team’s upcoming tour of Australia later that year. England went on to win the series 2-1.After that triumph, a small urn was presented to Bligh’s team, giving rise to the tradition of calling every future Test series between England and Australia “The Ashes.”What the urn actually contains has long been debated. Some believe it holds the ashes of a bail from the third match of the 1882 series, while others speculate it might contain remnants of a burnt ball cover or stump.In 1998, Bligh’s daughter-in-law offered another theory, claiming the urn held the ashes of her mother-in-law’s burnt veil.The original urn was handed over to the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at Lord’s after Bligh’s death in 1927, and since then, teams have competed for a replica of the treasured artifact.Today, the England–Australia rivalry remains one of cricket’s most iconic and fiercely contested battles, with both sides determined to claim the coveted urn.","England and Australia face off in the opening Test of the 2025-26 Ashes series at the Optus Stadium in Perth.

One Dead, Thousands Evacuated as Cyclone Montha Tears Through Andhra and Odisha

VISAKHAPATNAM: Andhra Pradesh is bracing up for another cyclone as the India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecast formation of a low-pressure area over southeast Bay of Bengal on November 22 (Saturday). The weather system is expected to move west-northwestwards and intensify into a depression over central parts of south Bay of Bengal around Nov 24.The weather experts anticipate that the system may further strengthen into a cyclonic storm over the southwest Bay of Bengal, potentially setting the state for another wet spell over coastal Andhra Pradesh (CAP) as well as Rayalaseema from Nov 26 to 29.If the low-pressure-area intensified into a cyclone, the season’s second cyclone storm would move closer to the Andhra Pradesh coast. It may be recalled that severe cyclonic storm Montha on October 28 and 29 this year left a trail of destruction in parts of Andhra Pradesh, leaving two persons dead and inundating agricultural crops over 80,000 hectares, damaging roads and culverts. The severe cyclonic storm crossed the Andhra Pradesh and Yanam coasts close to Narsapuram in Andhra Pradesh on Oct 29.Ahead of the system’s intensification, the weathermen have advised the farmers to complete harvest works as the farmers have suffered losses in the recent October rains.Meanwhile, cold weather conditions continue to grip the tribal pockets in the Alluri Sitharama Raju (ASR) district, where residents are shivering under plummeting temperatures. On Thursday (Nov 20), Chintapalle recorded a minimum temperature of 9.5°C — the second lowest of the season so far. It may be recalled that Chintapalle recorded 6.8°C on Wednesday (Nov 19).","The India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecast formation of a low-pressure area over southeast Bay of Bengal on November 22 (Saturday) The weather system is expected to move west-northwestwards and intensify into a depression over central parts of south Bay of Bay around Nov 24.

Patrick Beverley’s abuse allegation puts his Barstool career in danger

The former Los Angeles Clippers player, Patrick Beverley, is all over the internet due to his felony charges against his sister. According to TMZ Sports, Beverly allegedly punched and choked his sister, Mya Beverley, after he found her with an 18-year-old man late at night. The situation worsened after he abused her and grabbed her by the neck. However, an American businessman, Dave Portnoy, hinted that he might cut Beverley out of Barstool Sports only if the allegations were proven to be true.Patrick Beverley has a podcast with the company, “Hooping’ N Hollerin”. But the real question is: How far is he going to be a part of the company, and what happens if he gets kicked out of it? Well, according to his sister, Mya, Patrick Beverley committed a felony, and he was arrested and booked for felony charges.According to the reports published by TMZ Sports, Beverley is now under arrest. Dave Portnoy said, “We'll let the facts play out”. “Certainly, with what is hanging there, we can't have him be part of what we're doing right now, and we got to see how it settles, but this is horrible. If there's any truth to it, he won't be back at Barstool”, Portnoy added further.Based on what Portnoy has heard, he confirmed that there is absolutely no reason why they should take a rash decision about Beverley’s career.But, from what they saw in the documents, things are going to get ugly and intense, in short, “brutal”. Portnoy also confirmed that he and Beverley spoke on the phone after the story was brought to the surface by his 15-year-old sister.His sister said, “Beverley grabbed her by the neck and with both hands, and picked her up off the ground, by having her feet come up from the floor”. He even pushed her body against the wall of an open room in their house. Moreover, Beverley gave her a death threat, saying he would be the family relative to kill her.Patrick Beverley has a court hearing next month. While his lawyers and legal team have denied the allegations, saying that those were incorrect, one of them said that he would be cleared of all the felony charges in the near future.Also read: Patrick Beverley’s attorney issues statement after accused’s sister drafts affidavit against former NBA player","Former LA Clippers player, Patrick Beverley, has been charged with felony assault.

Jonty Rhodes on India's challenge vs spin, domestic cricket and fixed Test centres

“It’s about time. It’s been so long!”That was manager Mikel Arteta’s response when quizzed about Arsenal’s long-wait for a fourth Premier League title. And this was three years ago! The wait has only grown longer for a club who were last crowned English champions in 2004.With the Spaniard now into his sixth full season since taking charge of the Gunners, the “it’s about time” sentiment has only increased among, not just critics, but club icons too. Back in May, Thierry Henry, the club’s record goalscorer conceded that Arsenal should have had some silverware to show for their efforts, considering how close they have come on a couple of occasions within the last three years.Also Watch:Three months into the new season, they have got off to a start which once again has their long suffering fans brimming with hope. Ahead of Sunday’s eagerly-anticipated North London derby against Tottenham Hotspur, Arsenal sit four points clear at the top of the table with 11 games played. It’s the sort of situation that’s bound to generate ‘a lot of noise’, as the club’s star midfielder Declan Rice pointed out.“I think it's just one of those things that there's always going to be talk around us because we have such a good manager, we have such good players, and obviously with the start we've had this season,” Rice told The Times of India in an interview facilitated by JioHotstar this week.“We've been top of the table going into the last two international breaks, so that creates a lot of noise. But it's important for us that we block that out, which we have been doing.“We take no notice of it and we just keep doing what we've been doing, because in the Premier League, anything can happen at any time, and we just need to stay focused and take one game at a time. We're doing well at just focusing on ourselves at the minute, which is good.”A big reason behind Arsenal’s march is Rice. In the build-up to Sunday’s big clash at the Emirates, the league shared a one-minute clip on one of its official social media accounts, highlighting the England international’s all-round impact. From scoring goals to creating chances, Rice “can do it all”, the caption stated.The 26-year-old believes he can do even more, as he spoke of how his mental approach to the game has transformed since becoming a club-record signing for Arsenal two seasons ago. “In my earlier days, I wasn't really bothered about scoring or assisting. I just wanted to just play well for the team and get three points. But on top of that, now I've got that hunger and obsession with helping the team out, knowing that my goal and my assist has helped us to win. So if I can score or assist, that makes me really happy.“But I've still got so much room for improvement in that area as well. I think I can score way more and can assist more as well. So we're going to keep pushing for that.”Rice, of course, is not just integral to Arsenal’s objectives but to the national team’s as well, in a season leading into the Fifa World Cup . And the Three Lions shirt carries its own weight of expectations from a football-mad nation desperate to end a major trophy drought that makes Arsenal’s wait seem much lighter in comparison. Rice spoke of the challenge of juggling responsibilities with club and country.“Obviously, when we have our club games, we're fully 100% committed and focused on that. But then when we go away with England, you need to put 100% energy into that as well. Because if you turn up to England and don't have 100% energy or you don't apply yourself in the right way, then you're not going to have the results that we've just had,” he said, referring to England’s historic World Cup qualifying campaign which saw Thomas Tuchel’s side finish with a perfect record of eight wins from as many matches and no goals conceded.“So when you go away, you have to park the club part to the side for a week or 10 days, for however long you’re away. And as soon as you're back with Arsenal, then you get back into the swing of things.“Even Tuchel, the manager, speaks about it in terms of us just being together and everyone pulling in the right direction. It’s like, ‘don’t bring your club stuff into England’ and it just keeps it really fresh.”In last season’s Champions League quarterfinal first leg against record 15-time winners Real Madrid, Rice served notice of his ability in dead-ball situations, scoring two magical free kicks in a 3-0 win for Arsenal. The second of those two stunners has earned him a nomination for the FIFA Puskas Award (best goal of the year), the mention of which brings a wide smile to his face. Asked if there was a dead-ball specialist who helped shape his own style and Rice would name a famous compatriot.“Free kicks, I think the most iconic ones, obviously (David) Beckham, just because of how many he scored, the way he took them. We obviously have a completely different run up, but it's just iconic the way he took free kicks and how many he scored. I've only scored two. They've been two good ones, but I need to score some more now.”Beware Tottenham!(Watch Arsenal vs Tottenham Hotspur in the Premier League on Nov 23, Live & exclusive on Star Sports Network and JioHotstar)",Arsenal sit four points clear at the top of the Premier League with 11 games played.

New Delhi: For Parveen Hooda, the road back to the ring was far lonelier than any bout she has ever fought. The young boxer had spent nearly two years on the outside — suspended after three whereabouts failures, grappling with the stigma, the self-doubt and the slow grind of proving she hadn’t given up on herself or her sport.On Thursday in Greater Noida, she finally stepped back into the light. With a gritty 3-2 split verdict over Japan’s Ayaka Taguchi, Parveen claimed the 60kg gold at the World Boxing Cup Finals, turning a period defined by silence and uncertainty into a statement of revival.“This gold means everything,” Parveen told TOI during an interaction. “For me, it’s not just about winning a tournament, it’s about proving to myself that I could come back after everything I went through. I wanted to show that I never stopped fighting, even when I wasn’t inside the ring.”The 25-year-old from Rurki village in Rohtak, Haryana, who had once proudly clinched bronze at the 2023 Asian Games in Hangzhou, found herself stripped of both her Asiad medal and the consequent 2024 Paris Olympics quota spot. Her world collapsed when the International Testing Agency (ITA) announced in May 2024 that she had committed three whereabouts failures between April 2022 and March 2023 — a violation under WADA’s (World Anti-Doping Agency) anti-doping rules.Her punishment: a 22-month suspension, later backdated to 14 months. Her loss: an Olympic dream she had fought to earn.“It broke me at first,” she said. “I won’t lie about that. When the ban was announced, I kept thinking — how did I let something like this happen? For months, I struggled with guilt and frustration,” she said.Cut off from competition and team environments, she retreated into what she calls “a tunnel of introspection”. The silence was deafening but eventually healing.“There were days I didn’t feel like training at all,” Parveen recalled. “But then I reminded myself — this is not how my story ends. I told myself that when I return, I have to return stronger, mentally and physically.”She turned the forced break into a period of rebuilding. “I kept telling myself that I still belonged at the top,” she said.",Parveen Hooda won gold at the World Boxing Cup Finals on Thursday.

Who is Tatiana Schlossberg? Former US President JFK’s granddaughter who says she has a year to live because of terminal cancer,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-tatiana-schlossberg-former-us-president-jfks-granddaughter-who-says-she-has-a-year-to-live-because-of-terminal-cancer/articleshow/125508423.cms,"Tatiana Schlossberg, the granddaughter of the late President John F. Kennedy, shared a heart-wrenching personal story revealing her terminal cancer diagnosis. At just 35 years old and a devoted mother of two, she now faces a devastating prognosis following the discovery of a rare mutation of leukemia that emerged after childbirth.





Tatiana Schlossberg is the granddaughter of former US President John F. Kennedy and has revealed that she is suffering from terminal cancer and has been told she may have only a year to live.The 35 year old journalist and author disclosed her diagnosis in a personal essay for The New Yorker. Usually, the Kennedy descendant keeps her life private but wanted people to know about her condition.Schlossberg was born to Caroline Kennedy and Edwin Schlossberg. Tatiana is part of one of America’s most famous political families. She is a writer focused on climate and environmental issues and also the mother of two young children with her husband, George Moran. Their daughter was born in May 2024, shortly before doctors discovered her illness.In her essay, “A Battle with My Blood,” Schlossberg explained that routine tests after childbirth revealed extremely high white-blood-cell levels. “A normal white-blood-cell count is around four to eleven thousand cells per microlitre. Mine was a hundred and thirty-one thousand cells per microlitre,” she wrote. What followed was a diagnosis of acute myeloid leukaemia with a rare mutation called Inversion 3.She underwent months of chemotherapy and later received a stem cell transplant from her older sister, Rose. The transplant briefly put her into remission, but the cancer soon returned. Her doctor gave the final verdict: he could keep her alive “for a year, maybe.”Schlossberg also used her essay to criticise her mother’s cousin, health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, for cutting research funding. “I watched as Bobby cut nearly a half billion dollars for research into mRNA vaccines, technology that could be used against certain cancers,” she wrote.Her family has been at her side throughout her treatment. “They have held my hand unflinchingly while I have suffered,” she said. Her siblings include Rose, 37, and Jack, 32, JFK’s only grandson, who recently announced plans to run for Congress in New York.Her diagnosis comes as the Kennedy family continues to grapple with decades of personal tragedy. The assassinations of President John F. Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy, the plane crash that killed John F. Kennedy Jr., and the recent deaths of Saoirse Kennedy Hill, Mary Richardson Kennedy and Maeve Kennedy McKean have all left deep scars on the family. Tatiana’s illness now joins a long list of painful losses the Kennedys have endured.","Tatiana Schlossberg, 35, is the granddaughter of former US President John F. Kennedy.

‘Is JD Vance sleeping on the couch’: Usha Vance’s missing wedding ring sparks online buzz,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/is-jd-vance-sleeping-on-the-couch-usha-vances-missing-wedding-ring-sparks-online-buzz/articleshow/125505665.cms,"'Ukrainian Victory A Fantasy': JD Vance Publicly Humiliates Zelensky & EU; 'Can't Stop Russia...'

-





In any normal country, a woman not wearing her wedding ring would be an unremarkable detail. In America, it becomes a multi-platform cultural event. When Usha Vance walked alongside Melania Trump at Camp Lejeune, she looked as poised as always, balancing the two worlds she inhabits: the institutional weight of the vice president’s residence and the everyday chaos of raising three small children.But cameras do not look for poise; they look for anomalies. And the cameras found one. Her ring finger, unadorned, immediately entered the bloodstream of American political chatter. Within hours, Adam Parkhomenko was broadcasting zoomed-in images as if unveiling state secrets, and the Democrats’ official account mischievously wondered whether JD Vance was “sleeping on the couch.” It was the kind of moment that reveals how starved American politics has become for new toys: a missing ring can now sustain a twenty-four-hour narrative cycle.Yet this was only the beginning of an increasingly ornate speculation spiral.A Marriage Already Under the Magnifying GlassThe Vances have never had the luxury of being a normal political couple. JD Vance’s rapid political transformation—from memoirist diagnosing cultural decay to one of MAGA’s most polished ideologues—placed his marriage in a spotlight neither of them invited. Usha Vance’s privacy and her reluctance to play the glossy political spouse has only amplified the curiosity.She rarely grants interviews, avoids unnecessary public appearances and maintains her professional identity without theatrics.That quietness, however, has created an inadvertent vacuum. And nature, like political Twitter, abhors a vacuum.Which is why JD Vance’s recent public comment about his wife’s faith instantly became part of the interpretive scaffolding. Speaking at a Turning Point USA event in late October, he said he hoped she would one day convert to Christianity. He framed it sincerely, emphasising belief rather than pressure, and acknowledged that she has her own will and path. But the remark added a subtle crackle to the public’s understanding of their dynamic, introducing the kind of theological subplot political media cannot resist.When you combine that moment with the ringless photograph, the discourse begins to write itself. The story was no longer just about an accessory; it became a referendum on marriage, faith, identity and modern American expectations.The Erika Kirk Chapter and the Internet’s Appetite for ChaosThe speculation did not start with the ring. The Vances had already been drawn into bizarre online conversations the previous month when an entirely unrelated moment went viral: a photograph of Erika Kirk—widow of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk—hugging her husband. The moment was utterly innocuous, but the internet, in its infinite mischief, began constructing imaginary jealousies and rivalries involving Usha Vance, despite no evidence and no real-world connection. It was one of those absurd flare-ups where the commentary had nothing to do with the people involved and everything to do with the commentariat’s hunger for narrative tension.That brief and silly controversy primed the environment for the ring discourse. When people are already gossiping, they only need the tiniest spark to light a fresh fire. The missing ring was that spark.In the ecosystem of online politics, rumours do not need credibility; they merely need proximity.Who Usha Vance Actually IsThe reality, however, is far more grounded than the fantasies being projected onto her. Usha Vance is the daughter of Hindu Indian immigrants, raised in San Diego by two educators who instilled in her a calm, disciplined intelligence. She excelled at Yale Law School, clerked at the Supreme Court, advanced in one of America’s most prestigious litigation firms and built a life grounded in private achievement rather than public spectacle. She is, in many ways, the antithesis of Washington performance culture.Her reluctance to posture has only heightened fascination. People cannot place her into the usual categories because she refuses to shrink herself into the decorative role political spouses have historically been forced into. She belongs to a newer generation of women—those who maintain autonomy even while surrounded by systems that expect ceremonial compliance.And so every image becomes textured with imagined subtext. The less she speaks, the more others speak for her.A Story Revealing More About America Than About the VancesThe frenzy around the ring says little about the Vances’ marriage and everything about the political culture examining them. America has reached a stage where it processes politics as fandom. The voters are the audience, and the politicians are unwitting actors in a reality drama they never signed up for. Meaning must be found in every silence, every gesture, every accessory. Even a missing ring becomes a plot point because the country has forgotten how to accept ordinary explanations.There is no evidence of conflict. There is no indication of marital strain. And there is no reason to believe the missing jewellery was meant to communicate anything at all. Sometimes a ring is simply on a bathroom counter because motherhood is exhausting, schedules are tight and life happens faster than symbolism can keep pace.But none of that satisfies a political culture that has forgotten the difference between intimacy and spectacle.The Ring Was Never the Story. The Projection Was.Usha Vance has made it clear—through her choices, her privacy and her demeanour—that she belongs first to herself. Her ring does not define her. Her public appearances do not script her. And her marriage is not a crowd-sourced interactive mystery for the internet to solve.The ring became a national conversation because people saw in it whatever narrative they needed. Some projected marital discord, some projected cultural difference, and some simply enjoyed the theatre of it all. But the truth remains quietly unchanged: the second lady’s identity is not a storyline for public consumption. It is her own, shaped by her upbringing, her intellect, her work and her family, unburdened by the noise of those who mistake observation for insight.If anything, this episode reveals one thing powerfully. The country may not know what to do with a woman who refuses to play the part she is assigned, so it invents new parts for her. But Usha Vance, ring or no ring, continues to walk through that noise untouched, a reminder that the most compelling figures in public life are often the ones who decline to perform for the crowd.","Usha Vance was pictured without her wedding ring at Camp Lejeune.

“This is bringing us all together as a community,”

“If you don’t smoke, don’t start.”

“If you currently smoke, and you have the willpower, quit.”

“One more cig! One more cig!”





In true New York fashion, a city that can turn anything into an impromptu flash mob, from Gen-Z lookalike frenzies to spontaneous Union Square stampedes, the latest gathering was sparked not by a celebrity but by an elderly Brooklyn man named Bob. Known online as “Breaking Bob” and dubbed the “Cigarette Maestro,” he managed to tap into something deeply familiar: the universal, five-minute smoke break that can feel like a small lifeline in the middle of whatever you’re going through. The invitation resonated instantly. By Friday afternoon, roughly 2,500 people, according to the event page , influencers, college students, skaters, office workers, and anyone who just happened to be passing through the Village, crowded the corner of Waverly Place and University Place outside Washington Square Park to join him.Wrapped up in his khaki coat, plaid scarf and a purple beanie, Bob set the entire chain of events in motion with a single flyer. Earlier this week, videos of Bob, cigarette in hand, strolling through Washington Square Park, began circulating widely as he moved between strangers and small groups, handing each a flyer and a cigarette with disarming confidence. Hey, you guys look like you’re smokers,” “Let’s all light up together… tell your friends, November 21st, 2pm.His clip circulated across Instagram and X, amplified by the social account Old Jewish Men of New York and an endorsement from original poster Mal, who wrote: “This guy wanted me to invite y’all to his cigarette party next week. I’ll likely be in attendance. I don’t like going back on promises to old people.”The premise was simple: 2:00–2:05 p.m. Only five minutes, one cigarette, and, if you RSVP’d through the QR code, a free one from Bob himself. The QR led to Partiful, where he wrote: “I’ll give you one for free if you RSVP here.” More than 2,500 people did.Videos from the park show crowds spilling across the pathways, chanting “Bob! Bob! Bob!” while waving cigarette packs in the air for him to autograph. One attendee proudly wrote, “I was there. Had my Marlboro box signed by Bob!” Another marvelled at the sheer brevity of it all: “2:00–2:05 legendary link-up.” A third captured the collective joke of the afternoon, asking: “you think bro just dipped as soon as it turned 2:06pm?”Despite the scale, police did not intervene; in clips shared across social media, a few patrol units can be seen pulling up, watching from a distance and letting the gathering continue exactly as advertised, informal, harmless and five minutes long.Bob leaned into the moment. Before anyone lit up, he took a megaphone and addressed the crowd, a scene NBC later described when they brought him into the studio, noting that his real intention was to warn young New Yorkers about the dangers of smoking. The crowd applauded as he spoke.he said, drawing louder cheers.Then he delivered the message he had been building toward:Only after the applause broke did the event shift into what it had been advertised as: a cigarette break en masse. Once the first round of puffs was done, the crowd erupted into a chant,— rolling across the corner like a call-and-response only New York could stage.Throughout the afternoon, clips showed Bob handing out Marlboros, posing with fans, and taking part in a blind taste test in which a cigarette was lit inside a cardboard box and presented to him through an opening. He guessed all five brands correctly.The turnout stunned even the organisers behind Old Jewish Men of New York, the Brooklyn-based social brand that often spotlights eccentric New York characters. The account, created by Noah Rinsky, helped push the event into the city’s bloodstream, but the cultural moment belonged entirely to Bob: an old man handing out flyers, looking for company, and accidentally creating the city’s most wholesome five-minute flash mob.By late afternoon, “Cigarette Maestro” was trending across TikTok, X and Instagram, with thousands of New Yorkers sharing clips of the booming crowd, the chanting, the cigarette signing, and Bob’s megaphone speech. Even non-smokers showed up “just to support him,” as one attendee wrote.The internet has already predicted imitators. New Yorkers, meanwhile, are simply enjoying the delightfully absurd fact that the most talked-about gathering in the city today was organised by an elderly man offering strangers a cigarette and a moment of camaraderie.And for five minutes, it worked.","Around 2,500 New Yorkers crowded Waverly Place after Bob invited strangers to “light up together” for a five-minute smoke break. Bob, known online as ‘Breaking Bob’ and dubbed the ‘Cigarette Maestro,’ set the entire chain of events in motion with a single flyer.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125506680,imgsize-1125046,width-400,resizemode-4/bob-ciggratte-meetup-newyork.jpg"
