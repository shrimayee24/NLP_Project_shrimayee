with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres.

Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece.

Kural 667

Judge not by stature; It is the small

Linchpin that keeps the great chariot moving.

“They also serve who only stand and wait.”

India has never witnessed a travel crisis like the one that engulfed IndiGo recently. Lakhs of passengers were stranded. Airports became impatient seas of distress.A newlywed couple, still radiant from their vows, begged for a way to reach their own reception while guests waited elsewhere. A grieving wife stood by her husband’s coffin. Transit passengers wandered aimlessly, their connecting flights cancelled, their luggage lost somewhere in the airport’s labyrinth.I was at an airport on Dec 5. I was fortunate — I hadn’t checked in my luggage and returned home. But even leaving the airport was an ordeal. For more than two hours, I walked through a suffocating tide of fear, anger and confusion. Rage rose in me too — at those responsible for this collapse, none of whom were present.Passengers have every right to expect reliability and accountability. But amidst the justified outrage,- counter agents, duty managers, ground staff, cabin crews — stood for hours absorbing wave after wave of human ire. Some passengers grew abusive, shouting obscenities even at women staff. Videos showed people climbing over counters to scream at employees who had no authority to fix what had broken.Crises always expose the invisible backbone of organisations. During the 2008 Taj attack, some employees protected guests with extraordinary courage. IThat is why what I saw on the 5th was both heartbreaking and humbling. These employees were not just performing tasks; they were holding the emotional weight of thousands. Their leaders had failed them, but they still tried to do the next best thing, remaining calm in the middle of the storm.Thiruvalluvar knew the worth of such unseen strength.In, he writes:Uruvukandu Ellamai Vendum UlrulperumtherkkuAchchani Annaar Udaiththu.While this couplet emphasises that looks do not matter, it also talks about one’s stature in any hierarchy. Valluvar reminds us that greatness often rests on the smallest, quietest contributions. The lynchpin is not ornate, not celebrated, not even noticed. But remove it — and the entire chariot collapses.Is that not what we witnessed?Every time I walk through an airport, I see one lone staff member posted near each escalator. Their job is simply to stand there — not sit — through the entire shift, just in case someone needs help. They go unnoticed, but they are the first to respond when something goes wrong.I think of the watchmen in our buildings, who keep vigil while we sleep. The lineman who climbs an electric pole in the rain, so our homes stay lit. The ‘akka’ who clears tables in a crowded restaurant, unseen by those she serves.Their work is not glamorous. Their names may never be known. But they are the ones who keep life moving in quiet continuity. The grand chariots of our modern world do not move because of the one seated on the throne but because of the humble linchpins. John Milton captured this truth beautifully:","Bharathi Bhaskar explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text 'Thirukkural' Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125935195,imgsize-87018,width-1000,height-562,resizemode-75/125935195.jpg"

Duo purchased flight tickets on Dec 7, lookout circular issued within 24 hrs

Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra, co-owners of 'Birch by Romeo Lane' nightclub in Goa, were detained by Thai police early on Thursday on the request of Indian law enforcement agencies. As their passports were suspended, they became persona non grata in Thailand, prompting the local police to take them into custody, sources said.Sources said that a team of Thai police located them at Hotel Indigo in Patong, Phuket, based on their travel and passport details and seized their belongings and luggage. Their pictures in Phuket police's custody were released on Thursday and showed the duo handcuffed. They were subsequently shifted to the immigration detention centre where they are likely to be lodged till their deportation. The cops are hopeful of the brothers' return to India by the end of this week with formal channels in communication with each other. India and Thailand had signed a formal extradition treaty in 2013, which came into force in 2015.A team has been sent to Phuket to coordinate the deportation, sources said. The brothers have turned 'wanted' after fleeing the country following last week's blaze at their club in Goa that claimed 25 lives. They had fled to Phuket, Thailand and were staying at a hotel.Goa police had requested Interpol, through MEA and CBI, for their apprehension. A blue corner notice was subsequently issued against them by Interpol.The regional passport office in Delhi had issued a notice to the brothers seeking an explanation from both as to why action should not be initiated to impound their passports within seven days. Their passports were subsequently declared invalid, easing the execution of Indian request for their detention.According to Goa police, the brothers purchased seats on a Phuket-bound flight at 1.17 am on Dec 7, even as firefighting operations were under way. By 5.30 am, they were airborne on IndiGo flight 6E-1073.By morning, a Goa police team had reached Delhi with an arrest warrant for the Luthra brothers and searched their residential and office premises, but they were not found. ""Since they were unavailable, a notice under the appropriate sections of law was pasted at their residence. By the evening of Dec 7, a lookout circular was issued against both by the Bureau of Immigration at the request of Goa police,"" a police officer said.The blaze broke out around 11.45pm Saturday (Dec 6) during an event attended by more than 150 tourists. A preliminary investigation by Goa police and Directorate of Fire Services found it was triggered when electric firecrackers struck the wooden ceiling. As flames coursed through the roof, guests and performers bolted. While most of them were able to step out of the club, many were trapped in the basement after the exit caught fire.Besides a partner named Ajay Gupta, five staff members of Birch, chief general manager Rajiv Modak, gate manager Priyanshu Thakur, bar manager Rajveer Singhania, general manager Vivek Singh, and operations manager Bharat Kohli have been arrested till now.","Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra, co-owners of 'Birch by Romeo Lane' nightclub in Goa, were detained by Thai police early on Thursday on the request of Indian law enforcement agencies.

NEW DELHI: The BJP on Friday claimed that tensions between ‘Team Rahul’ and ‘Team Priyanka’ within the Congress are now “out in the open” after a former party MLA from Odisha wrote to Congress Parliamentary Party chief Sonia Gandhi, urging the removal of party president Mallikarjun Kharge on the grounds that “age is not on his side. ”Ex-MLA Mohammed Moquim suggested that younger leaders, including Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, should be given greater prominence.""Team Priyanka vs team Rahul out in the open now Internal rift in Congress out! Senior Congress leader from Odisha writes to Sonia Gandhi: Says 'Kharge Hatao ,Priyanka Lao; Hits out at state and central leadership.' He notes a 'deep and growing disconnect' between the Congress leadership and Indian youth, saying that under the current leadership of Mallikarjun Kharge, who is 83, the party has been unable to resonate with the youth,"" BJP spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla wrote on X.Earlier, Moquim, the former legislator from Odisha's Cuttack whose daughter is the sitting Congress legislator from the seat, told news agency ANI, ""The party is going through a difficult phase and needs her advice and new leadership... Age is not on AICC (All India Congress Committe) president Mallikarjun Kharge's side... We should bring forward young leaders. I know that Soniaand the CWC (Congress Working Committee) members will definitely discuss this.""The veteran politician has been Congress president since October 2022, when he defeated Thiruvananthapuram MP Shashi Tharoor. One of the party’s senior-most leaders, he succeeded Sonia Gandhi, who had been serving in an interim capacity since 2019 after Rahul Gandhi stepped down following the party’s rout in the Lok Sabha elections. She is the longest-serving Congress chief, leading the party from 1998 to 2017, before making way for her son.On the other hand, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra formally entered politics only in January 2019 and currently serves as a general secretary.Her recent Lok Sabha speech on the national song Vande Mataram drew wide appreciation, while her brother’s address on electoral reforms—during which he reiterated his allegations of 'vote chori' against the Election Commission and the ruling BJP—was sharply countered by Union home minister Amit Shah.","BJP claims that tensions between 'Team Rahul' and 'Team Priyanka' within the Congress are now 'out in the open' A former party MLA from Odisha wrote to Congress Parliamentary Party chief Sonia Gandhi, urging the removal of party president Mallikarjun Kharge.

The Ghost Of Bastar Falls: What Madvi Hidma’s Death Means For India’s War Against Maoist Insurgency

RAIPUR: Miles away from the hostile forests where Maoist commander Madvi Hidma once ruled with a gun before falling to police bullets recently, another Hidma is getting ready to take aim. But, not at security forces.""I am Hidma, but not that Hidma. I am Muchaki Hidma from Sukma district. I surrendered this year... Now I will aim at my target through archery,"" he says. Muchaki Hidma points at a straw target, preparing himself for Saturday, the concluding day of Chhattisgarh's Bastar Olympics in Jagdalpur, where Union home minister Amit Shah will be watching.Practising at Indira Priyadarshini Stadium on Friday, Muchaki Hidma, who is in his early 30s, says he now realises ""how freedom feels"" - not having to camouflage, hide behind trees or chase human targets with guns.Hidma is part of a team called 'Nuvabaat' - ""new path"". The team is made up of former Maoists and victims of insurgency, who have either surrendered or lost limbs and loved ones to violence. ""The moment I say 'Hidma', people look scared. So I have to clarify,"" he says.Over 700 surrendered Maoists and victims of their violence are expected to take the field on Saturday across disciplines - athletics, kabaddi, kho-kho, archery and traditional games.Hidma says he grew up in a large family where farming was never enough to provide for them. ""We could not expand the farming land due to the forest around. Our family was big and we had meagre resources. When the Naxals came and said, 'Come with us', I went. They gave me a gun. At first it even felt exciting,"" he says.The excitement ended when the fighting intensified. ""When the firing started, it made me introspect - how would I ever get out of this?""Bastar Olympics is a month-long sports carnival that covers seven Maoist-affected districts of Chhattisgarh's Bastar division: Bijapur, Dantewada, Kanker, Kondagaon, Narayanpur, Sukma and Bastar.

Total registrations have crossed 3.9 lakh, including around 2.3 lakh women - a more than two-fold jump from last year's participation.","Bastar Olympics is a month-long sports carnival that covers seven Maoist- affected districts of Chhattisgarh's Bastar division.

Evolving financial position driven by expanding careers

Projected net worth trajectory of Jey Uso and Takecia Travis through 2025

Jey Uso's financial picture has really taken off in recent years, thanks to the WWE giving him a big push as a singles performer. This has sent his yearly earnings soaring almost $1 millio,n which has helped put his personal net worth at about $3 million.Takecia Travis, on the other hand, keeps a pretty low profile outside of the wrestling world but throws in around $200,000 from family investments and a small business or two. So when you put their finances together, the Uso's have a combined net worth of about $3.2 million. You can see how their wealth has just grown steadily as Jey's star has risen and Takecia's been quietly handling the day-to-day stuff.Jey's pay varies depending on the storyline of the match. For now, he's in that top end of the WWE salary bracket, which, of course, is great for the couple's long-term financial prospects as they're still getting paid out for appearances and merch as well.His connection to the Anoa’i family sustains long-term demand, giving him opportunities beyond weekly programming, such as live-event bonuses and external partnerships that contribute meaningfully to his income. Takecia keeps a pretty low profile but is just as crucial to the show as she's the one who manages the family day to day and keeps the spending in check when Jey's on the road and wrestling schedules get all over the place.Their financial situation is growing but it's a steady & predictable thing. Not huge leaps forward but more like a gentle rise that matches the rhythm of Jey's wrestling career and the long-term plans they have.Jey’s singles popularity continues trending upward, and WWE’s investment in keeping him on major cards means he is likely to maintain or slightly increase his earnings through the year. His marketability tends to go up any time the company decides to go all in on the Bloodline storyline, which usually causes merch sales and appearance paydays to skyrocket.Takeica's financial impact remains pretty low-key but sensible, shoring up the household with a steady hand and a level head, whilst Jey's schedule is looking more like a rollercoaster than a predictable train ride.All things considered, theyre probably poised for some steady financial progress rather than an overnight success, thanks to a steady supply of WWE cash and some solid long-term thinking on family planning.Also Read: WWE Saturday Night's Main Event: John Cena's final match, full match card, preview, date, start timings for all regions, how to watch, and more details",Jey Uso and Takecia Travis have a combined net worth of about $3.2 million.

'Execute Tomorrow...': Candace Owens Claims Charlie Kirk Sent Alarming Texts Before Assassination

Erika Kirk tells Fox News she wants “one thing” kept private as Candace Owens links message to herself







Candace Owens reacted fast after Erika Kirk went on Fox News and asked people to stop searching for the secret place where her husband Charlie Kirk is buried. Erika Kirk told the public she wanted “one thing” left private for her family. But soon after, Candace Owens posted a video saying Erika Kirk’s words were really pointed at her. Candace Owens said in her new clip, “Super fun show today. You’re probably seeing the clips … it’s about me. It’s indirect, but it’s also about me. And don’t worry, in case you think it’s not about me, she is going to name check me on stage.”This reaction came as many conspiracy theories continue to grow around Charlie Kirk’s assassination. Charlie Kirk was shot and killed on September 10 while giving a speech at Utah Valley University. His body’s location has never been shared. This has only made more people online push strange theories, something Erika Kirk finally addressed on TV.When Erika Kirk sat with host Harris Faulkner on Fox News, she looked tired and upset as she spoke about the rumors. Harris Faulkner asked her, “Talk to me about this part of the conspiracies that are out there.This disturbing part that people are trying to guess where Charlie is.”Erika Kirk answered with strong emotion:“Can I have one thing? Can I have one thing? Can my children have one thing? Everything was public. We will be building the most beautiful memorial for my husband at Turning Point USA… But can I have one thing? Can my babies have one thing where we hold it sacred?”She also said she feared someone might try to damage Charlie’s grave.“Where my husband is laid to rest, where I don’t have to be worried about some secular revolutionary coming and destroying my husband’s grave while my daughter is sitting there praying. One thing. This is my husband.”Soon after Charlie Kirk’s death, Erika Kirk received money from life insurance and public donations.While Erika Kirk asked for privacy, Candace Owens continued to question the official story of Charlie Kirk’s murder. Owens has pushed many unproven ideas, saying the killing was a “hit” and claiming she got secret “military” tips from a source.Also Read: “Some Ignorant Black…”: Nick Fuentes Warns He Will Expose Candace Owens If TPUSA Livestream On Charlie Kirk Fails",Erika Kirk told the public she wanted “one thing” left private for her family.

What we know about Sherrone Moore’s firing





Sherrone Moore’s swift fall from one of college football’s most respected sidelines has stunned the Michigan community. The former Wolverines head coach, once celebrated for guiding the team through high-pressure moments, now faces a storm of allegations and uncertainty. His dismissal came only hours before police in Saline, Michigan confirmed he had been detained, adding another layer of tension to a day already marked by upheaval.The sudden collapse of Moore’s tenure unfolded at a pace that left players, fans and analysts scrambling for clarity. Accusations of an “inappropriate” relationship with a staffer triggered an internal investigation at the university, and the outcome was severe. While officials have not shared the specifics, the decision to terminate him with cause and hand the matter to law enforcement points to a situation far more serious than anyone inside the program expected.The University of Michigan released a series of statements outlining the reasons behind coach Sherrone Moore’s dismissal, though key details remain concealed. “U-M head football coach Sherrone Moore has been terminated, with cause, effective immediately,” the school wrote, adding that “credible evidence was found that Coach Moore engaged in an inappropriate relationship with a staff member.”The university emphasized that “this conduct constitutes a clear violation of University policy, and U-M maintains zero tolerance for such behavior. ”Hours after the firing, the City of Saline Police Department confirmed Moore’s detention. “The City of Saline Police Department assisted in locating and detaining former University of Michigan football coach Sherrone Moore,” the department said. “Mr. Moore was turned over to the Pittsfield Township Police Department for investigation into potential charges.” The nature of the incident that required police action has not been disclosed.With Moore out, Michigan moved quickly to stabilize the program. Veteran assistant and former Charlotte head coach Biff Poggi was appointed interim coach, stepping into the role for the second time this year after previously filling in during Moore’s suspension stemming from the sign-stealing scandal.Moore’s exit closes a chapter that once held enormous promise. Hired in 2018, he climbed through the ranks, helped engineer the team’s championship season in 2023, and made history as Michigan’s first Black full-time head coach. His record stood at 18-8, and he had three years left on a contract worth more than six million dollars for the upcoming season. The firing for cause means the university avoids paying his multi-million-dollar buyout.Michigan now begins its search for a permanent successor at a moment of turmoil, entering an already crowded and fast-moving coaching market with more questions than answers.Also Read: Who is Sherrone Moore’s wife Kell Moore?

Giannis Antetokounmpo to Miami Heat?

Reports suggest Miami Heat are emerging as a realistic landing spot for Giannis Antetokounmpo

Growing belief around the NBA suggests the Miami Heat now hold the edge in a potential Giannis Antetokounmpo pursuit

The Miami Heat have surged to the top of Giannis Antetokounmpo's list of potential destinations if he ever asks the Milwaukee Bucks for a trade, according to many league sources. The league's glamorous markets are forming Giannis Antetokounmpo's wish list, with Miami and New York emerging as top choices.Throughout the year, reports have connected him to both the Knicks and the Nets, portraying New York as ""Plan A"" for a superstar seeking a larger platform and a team willing to mortgage the future for an MVP. Miami is the contender that is just behind New York if it is at the top of the queue. Giannis would ""really love"" going to the Heat if the New York path is blocked, according to Howard Beck's recent remarks on The Zach Lowe Show, confirming previous reports that Miami is definitely on his short list.Since Milwaukee's heartbreaking first-round playoff loss to the Indiana Pacers last season and the team's rocky start to the 2025–26 season, trade rumors around Giannis have increased. The Bucks' inability to duplicate the supporting cast from their 2021 championship team has fueled ongoing rumors, despite their continued commitment to developing around their hero.According to Sam Amick of The Athletic, NBA executives are beginning to see Miami as the most attractive and practical destination for the two-time MVP.Giannis Antetokounmpo may be open to go to Miami, according to league insiders, if a package containing Tyler Herro, Kel'el Ware, and Jaime Jaquez Jr. is sent out.Amick said:“The Miami Heat, for example, are often handicapped by league insiders as a place that Antetokounmpo might be willing to call his new basketball home. Pat Riley and company could offer the Bucks a yacht full of draft assets, all their best young players and salary filler to make the numbers work.”The Nets have long considered Giannis a priority target should he become available, and the Knicks have previously been identified as a team that has exploratory conversations with the Bucks. New York provides what he has expressed a desire for in previous seasons: a sizable market, a fan base eager for competition, and the asset base necessary to make a blockbuster deal feasible.If talks with New York don't work out, Antetokounmpo might be interested in joining the Miami Heat, according to journalist Howard Beck of The Ringer. During a recent visit on The Zach Lowe Show, Beck revealed:“While writing Giannis's story and talking to people around the league, after New York, I was told Miami is the place Giannis would love to go if it's not New York.”From a basketball standpoint, the fit is clear. With Giannis as the focal point, Miami has a history of constructing stars, a defensive anchor in Bam Adebayo, and the organizational confidence to pursue another championship-level core.There is a growing perception throughout the league that the Heat will aggressively present themselves as the alternative if the Knicks are unable to complete a transaction. Insiders believe that Miami has surpassed the other teams who were previously mentioned as bidders. The 31-year-old Antetokounmpo is in his 13th season with the Bucks and has a 2026–2027 contract with a 2027–2028 player option.Although Giannis hasn't publicly stated that he wants to leave Milwaukee as of yet, the NBA is in agreement that South Beach is presently the favorite to win.Also read: Milwaukee Bucks re-sign Thanasis Antetokounmpo as Giannis Antetokounmpo locks in for 13th season","Miami Heat are emerging as a realistic landing spot for Giannis Antetokounmpo.

The Game Awards 2025: New Resident Evil 9 reveal trailer features Leon



More from the Game Awards 2025



Leon has finally made his appearance in the new Resident Evil 9 trailer, showcased during The Game Awards 2025. After months of anticipation and countless fan theories, the series’s most iconic hero returned in an action-packed trailer. The latest trailer features horror elements with intense combat moments, hinting at a chilling and immersive survival-horror experience for players.When Resident Evil 9 was initially revealed, most of the spotlight was placed on Grace Ashcroft, one of the game’s central characters. This left many longtime fans disappointed since Leon wasn’t shown, while others began speculating that he would eventually appear. Well-known insider Dusk Golem later claimed that Leon would be part of the new installment, and now Capcom has finally confirmed it. During The Game Awards, the studio unveiled an official trailer for Resident Evil Requiem, and Leon is front and center.The trailer also introduces a new stalker-type antagonist named Victor Gideon, who relentlessly hunts Grace Ashcroft. He calls her “special” and the “chosen one,” though his real intentions remain a mystery.In Resident Evil Requiem, Leon S. Kennedy returns to Raccoon City to assist Grace and take on Gideon, and the fresh footage gives players a glimpse of the gameplay as well.The new Leon-focused trailer hints at a more action-driven experience. Alongside his signature kicks and precise gunplay, Leon is shown wielding a chainsaw against enemies. This moment strongly suggests that players will now be able to turn enemy weapons against them, adding a new layer to combat.Alongside the new Resident Evil 9 trailer, Capcom also unveiled a fresh look at their upcoming title, Pragmata. The game has moved a step closer to launch, with a confirmed release date and a playable demo now available. Additionally, Capcom announced for the first time that Pragmata will also be released on the Nintendo Switch 2.Pragmata has long intrigued Capcom fans as a completely new IP shrouded in mystery since its reveal. Set on a lunar research station, the action-adventure game follows Hugh, the main protagonist, as he searches for a way to stop the hostile AI controlling the facility and find his way back to Earth. He’s accompanied by Diana, an android who resembles a young child and often sits on Hugh’s back during combat sequences.","The new Resident Evil 9 trailer hints at a more action-driven experience.

The Sherrone Moore scandal escalated as Michigan fired him for cause and police detained him within hours

How the Sherrone Moore scandal pulled Kelli Moore and staffer Paige Shiver into public scrutiny during the investigation

Why online rumors about Paige Shiver pregnancy spread during the Sherrone Moore scandal and what is actually confirmed

The Sherrone Moore scandal has turned Michigan football upside down in less than twenty four hours. The university fired Moore for cause after an internal investigation found he engaged in an inappropriate relationship with a staff member. Hours later, police detained him in Saline and transferred him to Pittsfield Township for investigation into potential charges. The Sherrone Moore scandal has now shifted from a personnel crisis to a legal storyline that is still developing.New updates indicate that Sherrone Moore will appear in court on Thursday afternoon, less than a day after his firing and sudden arrest near Michigan Stadium. Records show he is still being held in the Washtenaw County Jail, though officials have not released why he was detained or whether bond has been set.The fallout has pulled his wife, Kelli Moore, into public conversation, pushed an unnamed staffer into rampant online speculation, and forced Michigan to hand the program to interim head coach Biff Poggi while the fanbase tries to make sense of the timing, the investigation, and the sudden law enforcement involvement.Michigan athletic director Warde Manuel announced that Moore had been terminated immediately.Manuel said the university found “credible evidence” that the head coach engaged in an inappropriate relationship with a staff member. The findings constituted a violation of university policy, which allowed Michigan to remove him for cause.Moore, 39, had only been in the role for two seasons after replacing Jim Harbaugh. He posted an 18 8 record and finished the 2025 regular season 9 3. His tenure had already included previous suspensions, including discipline connected to the Connor Stalions sign stealing investigation and a COVID recruiting rules violation in 2023.The Sherrone Moore scandal intensified Wednesday night when ESPN reporter Dan Wetzel posted that Saline police located and detained Moore. Wetzel wrote that officers “assisted in locating and detaining” the coach before turning him over to Pittsfield Township authorities for further investigation. Law enforcement has not confirmed whether this detention is directly tied to the conduct that led to his firing, but the timing pushed the story into a new phase.Michigan quickly elevated Biff Poggi to interim head coach. Poggi previously filled the role during Moore’s earlier suspension this season. The program must now stabilize itself with a bowl game approaching and a full coaching search looming.As the fallout widens, OnlyFans creator Mia Sorety has added a new layer to the controversy, claiming Sherrone Moore sent her flirty direct messages while he was still married. Her allegation surfaced just as unverified rumors continued to swirl around Michigan staffer Paige Shiver, intensifying scrutiny of Moore’s online behavior and personal conduct, though none of these claims have been confirmed by the university or law enforcement.The Sherrone Moore scandal drove a spike in searches for “Sherrone Moore wife” and “is Sherrone Moore married.” His wife, Kelli Moore, has stayed mostly private throughout their ten year marriage. She describes herself on her profile as a “Jesus follower, Coach Moore’s wife, mom, and LGBTQ+ ally.” She is also a former college goalkeeper who played at Centre College in Kentucky. The couple has three daughters, which increased public attention as questions about the coach’s conduct took over the news cycle.The university has not identified the staff member involved in the investigation. That gap created space for speculation, and one name surfaced repeatedly online: executive assistant Paige Shiver. No verified report has named her as the staffer. The attention began after users noted that her social profiles went private or inactive as the story unfolded. Larry Brown Sports previously reported that she served as Moore’s executive assistant after beginning as an on campus recruiting staffer. Her father, Jeff Shiver, is a longtime Chicago Bears scout. None of these details confirm any connection to the misconduct, but the pattern of online speculation made her part of the conversation.The Sherrone Moore scandal continues to ripple through the program because no one outside the university’s investigation has a full picture of the timeline. Michigan confirmed only one fact. Moore engaged in an inappropriate relationship with a staff member. Everything else, including the extent of the conduct and the role of law enforcement, remains undisclosed.The Sherrone Moore scandal took another chaotic turn after rumors about Paige Shiver's pregnancy began trending on social media. Shiver, who served as Moore’s executive assistant, was never named in Michigan’s official statement, nor have police identified her in connection with any ongoing investigation. However, following Moore’s firing and police detention, several viral posts, claimed she was pregnant. None of these claims have been confirmed.The rumors gained traction after users noticed her social accounts going private and circulated screenshots that alleged a personal relationship with Moore. Some users also pointed to a wedding ring visible in older photos of Shiver, but again, no credible source has provided verification. As of now, the university, Moore, and Shiver have not publicly addressed any pregnancy claim, and it remains unsubstantiated internet speculation.Everything confirmed by the university is unchanged. Michigan stated that Sherrone Moore had an inappropriate relationship with a staff member, but it has not identified who that staff member is. The online theory that it was Paige Shiver or that a pregnancy played any role has no verified evidence behind it.","The Sherrone Moore scandal has turned Michigan football upside down in less than twenty four hours.

Money talk never seems to stop around NFL couples, and it gets even louder when the Mahomes name enters the chat.

Patrick’s value rises with every big game or new partnership, while Brittany continues to grow her own identity through business work and public engagement. It is a number that reflects steady movement rather than sudden jumps.Taylor Swift makes this comparison almost unfair. Forbes lists her at $1.6 billion, a number built on tours that break records, music that rarely leaves the charts and a business mind that keeps expanding her reach. Travis Kelce networth, according to Forbes in 2025 is $70 million, from his NFL career, endorsements and a growing presence in entertainment.Together, they reach $1.67 billion, a total that feels far beyond anything the sports world usually talks about. Their earnings come from two massive industries, and the difference shows immediately.The comparison does not take long to settle.

Growing speculation around Paige Shiver and why the university has not removed her

The Michigan football world has been shaken for days, but the question that refuses to fade is simple: Why is Paige Shiver not fired yet? As rumors spread about her alleged link to former coach Sherrone Moore’s dismissal and arrest, the curiosity around her position only grows. Michigan removed Moore quickly after finding he violated workplace conduct rules. Yet Shiver, who worked in operations and recruiting, remains on staff.This difference has fueled a storm of theories. Some believe the university is protecting a staff member. Others think her role has been misrepresented by unverified online claims. Either way, silence from all sides keeps the speculation alive. The unanswered questions have pushed Shiver from a background staffer to the unexpected center of a national sports scandal.Online discussions erupted when users claimed Paige Shiver was “half the scandal” and questioned why she kept her job if Moore allegedly crossed workplace lines. Another user went further, asking whether she was a “hired plant” used to push Moore out to avoid paying his buyout.A third post said Moore was “caught in 4k” with her, tying in salary rumors and relationship theories. None of these claims are verified, but the speed at which they spread shows how quickly social media shapes public opinion in uncertain moments.Her family background also added fuel. Paige is the daughter of Jeff Shiver, a longtime member of the Chicago Bears scouting department. Even though he has no known connection to the investigation, his name surfaced only because of the attention placed on Paige. She also disappeared from some social platforms soon after Moore’s firing, which made curiosity spike even more.Michigan has offered no confirmation that she was involved, stating that personnel confidentiality prevents naming the employee linked to Moore’s dismissal. This silence leaves a gap that rumor fills. Until the university clarifies her role, the question remains: why is Paige Shiver not fired yet, and is she connected to this scandal at all?Also Read: Was Paige Shiver forced into an abortion?

Meet Kelli Moore: Everything to know about Sherrone Moore’s wife after his shocking firing





Unexpected news has shocked University of Michigan football. Sherrone Moore, the Wolverines' head coach for just two seasons, was fired after it was alleged that he had a ""inappropriate relationship with a staff member. "" Fans, players, and the larger college football community were all taken aback by the December 2025 announcement. Athletic Director Warde Manuel confirmed the decision, stating, “U-M head football coach Sherrone Moore has been terminated, with cause, effective immediately. Following a University investigation, credible evidence was found that Coach Moore engaged in an inappropriate relationship with a staff member. This conduct constitutes a clear violation of University policy, and U-M maintains zero tolerance for such behavior.”Sherrone Moore’s departure has also turned attention toward his personal life, particularly his wife, Kelli Moore. Married since 2015, the couple has long maintained a balance between the high-pressure world of college football and a private family life. Kelli has mainly avoided the spotlight despite Sherrone's prominence in the sports world, giving their three daughters: Shiloh, Solei, and Sadie--a consistent presence.Curiosity about Kelli and her place in the Moore family has grown since the scandal has taken center stage in the media.Kelli Moore has quietly stood beside her husband through years of demanding seasons and public scrutiny. She and Sherrone Moore tied the knot in July 2015 after he proposed in December 2014. Reflecting on their early years together, Sherrone shared a heartfelt tribute in 2018 on Instagram: “Happy three year anniversary to my life partner and best friend. So proud of you and all your accomplishments. I am so happy and blessed beyond measure to call you my wife as the man upstairs leads us to live through him. Love you soo much and excited about what the future holds for us! #skforevermoore #bestfriends #Lifegoalsmeet.”The couple shares three daughters: Shiloh, born in 2019; Solei, born in 2022; and Sadie, whose birthdate has not been publicly shared. Kelli has been a familiar figure at games, whether supporting Sherrone during his time with the Central Michigan Chippewas or cheering from the sidelines and stands at the University of Michigan. While she avoids social media limelight, friends describe her as devout, family-oriented, and deeply committed to raising their children in a values-driven home.The whole Moore family is currently under intense scrutiny. Sherrone's dismissal has caused a stir in college football, bringing Kelli's personal life into the spotlight. She must manage the fallout from her husband's career-altering controversy while providing stability for their young daughters as the couple nears their tenth wedding anniversary. Although the specifics of the alleged improper relationship are still unknown, Michigan has reaffirmed its zero-tolerance policy.

Haeley’s goodbye message reveals the moments that made New York feel like home for the Alonsos



Pete Alonso’s free agency shift became one of the week’s biggest stories after the All-Star infielder signed a five year, 155 million deal with the Baltimore Orioles. His departure closed a long and lively chapter with the New York Mets, a team he grew up in as both a player and a person. The move also stirred deep feelings at home. Haeley Alonso shared a message that quietly captured the meaning of the years they spent in New York and how much the city shaped their life together.Her post did not read like a farewell to a fan base. It read like someone touching an old memory and realizing how full those years truly were. She chose a picture from his 2019 rookie season, a moment when everything felt new and uncertain. That image became the center of her reflection as she looked back on the start of their journey in baseball’s biggest market.Haeley wrote, ""I was looking back at pictures and videos last night of our past 7 years in New York to go down memory lane as we close out this chapter and enter a new one. As I was getting close to the beginning of my photos, I came across this picture I took of Pete after his debut game back in 2019. Admittedly, I burst into tears because it so vividly brought me back to that exact moment.Seeing him so dirty, so exhausted but it was the happiest I had ever seen him. ""Her words showed how clearly she remembers that night. It was not the stats or the noise in the stadium. It was the look on his face when he walked off the field, tired yet thrilled, stepping into a future neither of them could fully imagine then.She continued, ""We fell in love with New York City and lived in Manhattan for 6 years. We fell in love with the fans and their passion. Sometimes glowing, sometimes... spirited but always heartfelt. We loved this team. His teammates, coaches, staff... truly everyone. We made lifelong friends over the years and l'm forever grateful for that. Just so grateful for all of it Thank you for loving Pete.""Her message turned their exit into something gentle. A reminder that even when careers move forward, the memories stay with them, shaped by a city that gave them their first baseball home.Also read: Fans can’t stop talking as Adrian Morejon and wife Melany’s cozy pictures with a sunset moment win hearts online","Pete Alonso signed a five year, 155 million deal with the Baltimore Orioles.

After FIS Alpine posted the update, Lindsey Vonn and Mikaela Shiffrin quickly commented with heartfelt messages.Vonn sent her love and wrote, “Sending lots of love” while Shiffrin added, “thinking of you”.The incident also reminded many fans of Shiffrin’s own frightening crash last year. On November 30, 2024, Shiffrin fell during the giant slalom at the Killington World Cup. She caught an edge and crashed into the safety nets, suffering multiple injuries, including a deep puncture wound in her abdomen. She required surgery and spent nearly two months in rehabilitation.Shiffrin later opened up about the emotional struggle of her recovery. With The Players’ Tribune, she shared her lowest moments. She said, “I can admit that there were some extremely low moments. Times when I started second-guessing myself, or was critical of myself because I felt like I was letting what happened mess with me so much. It was like: Come on, Mikaela, people have had way worse crashes than that, way worse injuries. Those people got through it. What is wrong with you?”Shiffrin has since made a powerful comeback. She recently won her 104th World Cup race on November 30 at the Copper Mountain Giant Slalom.Fans will hope Olympics star Michelle Gisin also has a steady recovery and returns to the skiing circuit.Also Read: “Her support has been insane” - Aleksander Kilde reveals fiancée Mikaela Shiffrin’s inspiring role in his skiing comeback",Mikaela Shiffrin and Lindsey Vonn have sent strong messages of support to two- time Olympic champion Michelle Gisin.

Jeff Shiver always appreciates everyone he encounters

Also Read:

On December 10, Jon Rhoades of The Big Ten Huddle shared a swirl of rumors, much of it traced back to Justin Spiro (Host of “The Spiro Avenue Show”), who first broke news about former head coach Sherrone Moore. Spiro had been hinting since mid-August, even before the season began, that Moore could face serious trouble or even be fired by the University of Michigan. After the Ohio State game, Spiro predicted Moore’s dismissal could come within a week or as late as two months.The heart of the rumor is that Moore was fired due to an alleged relationship with Paige Shiver, his executive assistant, who was promoted when Moore took over for Jim Harbaugh. Now, the latest twist claims Shiver is pregnant and that Moore is confirmed as the father. Paige Shiver’s news has sent shock waves through cyberspace. But Shiver’s ties to football run deeper than college sidelines. She is the daughter of Jeff Shiver, a respected NFL scout. To understand her father’s story, let’s revisit Dan Pompei’s 2019 biographical interview in The Athletic.On a spring day in 1987, Jeff Shiver was flipping a hamburger in his Lafayette, Indiana, kitchen when the phone rang with a call that would change his life.Bill Tobin, the Chicago Bears’ personnel chief, was on the line, offering Shiver a chance to join the NFL’s scouting ranks. At the time, Shiver was earning $18,000 a year as a BLESTO scout, but Tobin’s offer of $25,000 felt like striking gold. Shiver eagerly accepted, feeling as if he had just won the lottery.As they sealed the deal with a handshake, Tobin promised, “You’re going to be with the Bears a long time.” More than three decades later, Shiver is still a fixture in Chicago, outlasting every other personnel man in the team’s hundred-year history. Only Scott DiStefano has served (five years) longer as a continuously employed NFL scout for the Denver Broncos. From fullback Brad Muster in 1988 to running back David Montgomery in 2019, Shiver has played a role in every Bears draft pick.“Jeff worked out even better than I thought,” Tobin said via The Athletic in 2019. “He’s a wonderful person and damn good scout. He’s been a giant in the scouting industry.”“I think the world of him,” said former Bears general manager Jerry Angelo. “I don’t know of anybody more respected and or revered in the scouting business than Jeff. I saw it from afar when I was with other teams, and I saw it firsthand when I got to Chicago. Whatever he says, you can take it to the bank.”Shiver credits his impeccable endurance to his faith and to Laura, his wife of 34 years (at the time of the 2019 The Athletic interview, now they’ve been together for roughly 40 long years). “It’s a hard job,” Shiver said. “To be able to do it begins with a great wife. Not once did I walk in the front door and hear her complain about me not being there.”Laura’s patience is all the more monumental given that Shiver spends up to 275 nights a year away from home, crisscrossing the country in his Ford Edge and tallying about 30,000 miles annually. Life on the road has brought him moments of pure bliss, like hearing, “Honey, I think I’m pregnant,” and heartache, like learning, “Your brother-in-law was in a car accident, and he didn’t make it.” His fondest travel memories are the late-night phone calls from his young children, Brittany, John, Paige, and Nicole, soft voices asking, “Dad, when are you coming home?”The former Bears general manager, Ryan Pace, told The Athletic in 2019 that Shiver’s experience on the staff is invaluable. Think about the relationships he’s built and the resources he has. He can call people and get information that a younger scout can’t. He also has a mental library of players.In a draft meeting, he’ll quickly point out when one player reminds him of another and explain why. Sometimes, he’ll mention players from way back that nobody else remembers. David Montgomery reminds Shiver a bit of Matt Forte. He does a great job of describing players. He has a million one-liners that make everyone laugh. He brings passion and energy while keeping things fun.Rod Graves, the former Bears personnel director, told The Athletic in 2019 that he always relied on Jeff for core evaluation. He would be shocked if Ryan (Pace) and those who followed did not lean on Jeff in the same way. Shiver was the definition of dependability, an astute evaluator, and someone Graves trusted without a doubt. Few people ranked higher on his list, both as friends and as professionals. Graves has only praise for Shiver and says with complete honesty that he loves the man.Dan Pompei of The Athletic revealed in 2019 that one of the earliest and most profound lessons Shiver absorbed as an NFL scout was to appreciate everyone he encountered, not just those with influence or something to offer. He made it a point to value the everyday people: the gas station attendant, the custodian, the security guard. Shiver’s philosophy was simple: the mission never outweighs the people you meet along the way: “The mission never is greater than the people you come in contact with. ”Pompei also painted a picture of Shiver’s upbringing, shaped by his late parents, John and Myrtle. Jeff inherited his strong work ethic from his father, who spent over 80 years as an auto mechanic at Shiver’s Auto Service, often working twelve-hour days, six days a week. During World War II, John served as a flight engineer and gunner in the Army Air Corps. Meanwhile, Myrtle managed the books and cared for Jeff and his two sisters.Talking to Pompei in 2019, Jeff said he still feels his mother’s love when he bakes her Sour Cream Pound Cake. And when the call came that brought him to the Bears’ front office, he was in the middle of cooking a hamburger. Distracted by the life-changing news, he burned it, but as he told Pompei, it was still the best burger he ever tasted: “By far, the best burger I ever tasted.”Jeff Shiver currently serves as Executive Scout for the Chicago Bears. Since 1987, Shiver has been a staunch presence with the Bears. His decades of commitment were commemorated in February 2020, when he received the first-ever C.O. Brocato Award for Distinguished Service to Scouting. This prestigious honor pays tribute to a legendary scout who dedicated four decades to the Houston Oilers, now known as the Tennessee Titans, and inspired countless others in the profession. ""It's such an honor, it's beyond belief,"" Shiver said in his acceptance speech at the Indiana Convention Center.","Jeff Shiver has been with the Chicago Bears since 1987.

What to expect from John Cena vs GUNTHER and other key storylines

WWE includes John Cena's farewell this weekend as we lead into Saturday Night's Main Event on Saturday, December 13, 2025, where Cena will have what WWE is promoting as his final in-ring match. The match with GUNTHER, which emerged from a build with GUNTHER via the booking of the ""Last Time Is Now"" tournament, is set to be a hard-hitting, technical exhibition aimed at giving Cena a big send-off while also pushing the opponent forward at the same time.The entire event is packed with multibrand showdowns and title ramifications, including Undisputed WWE Champion Cody Rhodes vs. NXT Champion Oba Femi, AJ Styles & Dragon Lee defending the World Tag Team Titles, and Bayley vs. Sol Ruca in a premier women’s division bout. WWE has carded the show as streaming live on Peacock in the US and regional broadcasts outside of the US.Saturday Night’s Main Event is scheduled to begin at 8:00 p.m. ET / 5:00 p.m. PT on December 13 in the U.S., exclusively on Peacock for American audiences. International fans can watch via WWE’s global distribution partners, including Sony Sports Network and SonyLIV in India, as well as WWE’s own channels in select regions.The 8:00 p.m. ET start converts to 1:00 a.m. GMT (UK, Dec. 14), 6:30 a.m. IST (India, Dec. 14), 11:00 a.m. AEST (Australia, Dec. 14), and 10:00 a.m. JST (Japan, Dec. 14). Viewers should check local listings for possible pre show programming or minor scheduling adjustments as WWE often updates timing for kickoff segments.Get ready for an evening with a nostalgic feel with a competitive edge. Cena can say farewell to the company where he spent the majority of his two-decade career, and GUNTHER's character has made it clear that he plans to ruin the moment by putting Cena through a long technical loss instead of the emotional moment we would all like to see. That dynamic creates the environment for either a heroic send-off for Cena, or a conclusive changing of the guard from one of WWE's most successful 21st century stars.In the meantime, on that same card, Cody Rhodes takes on Oba Femi in a hypothetical champion versus champion match-up that could alter the course of two titles as we head into 2026. AJ Styles and Dragon Lee roll on as World Tag Team Champions, Bayley’s match with Sol Ruca highlights WWE Putting Bright New Talent Up Against Established Stars, and why veterans like Kevin Owens have a way of spelling it out on WWE Raw.With Cena’s final bell looming, Saturday Night’s Main Event is positioned to deliver both emotional weight and competitive drama across a packed card.Also Read: WWE pays heartfelt tribute to John Cena ahead of last match at Saturday Night Main Event","Saturday Night's Main Event is scheduled to begin at 8:00 p.m. ET on December 13 in the U.S., exclusively on Peacock for American audiences.

Edwards also added nine rebounds.On the other hand, the Golden State Warriors are coming back to their arena after a break of four days. They are all set to prepare for the match against the Minnesota Timberwolves at the Chase Centre. Although Stephen Curry was present at the full practice on Wednesday, his coming back from his quadriceps injury still makes him doubtful.

They have won 6 out of their last 10 games. Additionally, they are positioned at the 13th spot in the defense ranking with an average of 113.4 defensive rating and the 8th spot in the offense rating with an average of 117.9 offensive rating. On the other hand, the Warriors' attack is significantly influenced by the non-availability of their leading scorer.Although Golden State anticipates a number of reinforcements in the near future, some key players are still doubtful based on the injury report for this game. The Timberwolves, on the other hand, have a more assured roster because they haven't announced any significant confirmed absences.The Wolves have taken advantage of the few days between games following their most recent game on Monday to regroup and tighten things up, something Rudy Gobert thinks will be beneficial.Also read: Jonathan Kuminga moving to Sacramento Kings?

Pacers’ Injury Problems Mount

What’s at Stake for Both Teams

The Philadelphia 76ers enter their December 12, 2025 matchup against the Indiana Pacers with renewed optimism as Joel Embiid inches closer to full strength. After an extended absence earlier in the season, the reigning MVP is trending upward, and his return has immediately shifted the tone in Philadelphia. Fans are hoping this is the night where “The Process” fully reasserts himself.This matchup also carries weight for a Sixers team trying to build momentum in a crowded Eastern Conference race. At 13-10, Philadelphia has shown flashes but has struggled to stay healthy. A healthier Embiid, paired with Tyrese Maxey’s probable return, positions the Sixers to capitalize against a severely depleted Pacers squad limping into Wells Fargo Center at 6-18.Joel Embiid is listed as probable due to left knee injury recovery, signaling a positive trend after logging 31 points and 12 rebounds in his return against the Chicago Bulls on December 8. Despite missing 14 games earlier this season for bilateral knee management, he completed 33 minutes in that outing without complications. A five-day rest period since then has helped his conditioning, giving him a chance to play back-to-back games for the first time this year.Beyond Joel Embiid, Philadelphia 76ers' depth continues to be tested. Tyrese Maxey, battling an illness, is also probable. Kelly Oubre Jr. remains sidelined with a left knee sprain, marking his twelfth straight missed game. Trendon Watford is still recovering from a left adductor strain, and Hunter Sallis remains out with a right shoulder sprain. Jared McCain, meanwhile, is available after recovering from thumb surgery.Indiana faces an even more daunting situation. Tyrese Haliburton is out with an Achilles issue, while Obi Toppin, Ben Sheppard, and Aaron Nesmith all remain unavailable due to their respective injuries. Quenton Jackson is questionable, further shrinking Indiana’s rotation as they attempt to compete on the road.Also read: Indiana Pacers vs Philadelphia 76ers regular season game: Full injury report, who's out, and more (December 12, 2025) With Philadelphia coming off a loss to the Lakers, Embiid’s expected availability could spark a needed response.

NHL Trade Buzz: Edmonton Oilers acquire Tristan Jarry in major swap with Pittsburgh Penguins,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/nhl-trade-buzz-edmonton-oilers-acquire-tristan-jarry-in-major-swap-with-pittsburgh-penguins/articleshow/125937171.cms,"Tristan Jarry (Image Via Twitter)

How Tristan Jarry, Spencer Stastney, and Sam Poulin impact the Oilers-Penguins trade and roster depth

The NHL trades are getting hotter, now even more so with the Edmonton Oilers and Pittsburgh Penguins changing their lineups through a big goaltending switch. The whole ice hockey universe is really talking about and speculating about the futures of the two teams; in fact, some of the best players and draft picks are even taking part. Goaltender, roster strength, and playoff chances are the factors that determine if Edmonton will have solid goaltending or if Pittsburgh will reshape its tactics.The Oilers reportedly exchanged goaltender Stuart Skinner, defenseman Brett Kulak, and their second-round pick in 2029 for goaltender Tristan Jarry and forward Sam Poulin, as per Sportsnet's Elliotte Friedman and AP News. Moreover, the Oilers also obtained defender Spencer Stastney from the Predators in exchange for a third-round pick in 2027. Jarry, a two-time All-Star, has recorded 9 wins, 3 losses, and 1 shoot-out loss, with a 2.66 GAA and a .909 SV percentage this season, whereas Skinner has had a hard time with an .891 SV percentage in 23 games. Kulak was a key player in the defense of Edmonton, while Poulin was almost the entire season in the AHL, but as a former first-round pick is definitely a player to be noticed. The trades show how serious Edmonton's situation with the goalies was and how Pittsburgh is interested in young players and draft picks more than ever.Jarry’s impressive comeback this season with Pittsburgh’s Dan Muse as his coach gives Edmonton a well-experienced goaltender who can help stabilize their net right away. Even though he has shown some inconsistencies in the postseason in the past, his numbers for the current season (2.66 GAA and .909 save percentage) prove he can take the pressure. Stastney adds depth to the Oilers' blue line after Kulak’s exit, and Poulin offers minor league support for Pittsburgh. The trade not only alters the goaltending situation in favor of Edmonton but also opens up room for the young goalies of Pittsburgh, thus making it evident that both teams are trying to meet short-term needs while planning for the long term.The swap points out the fact that Edmonton is in a hurry to upgrade its goaltending, while Pittsburgh is leaning towards drafts and prospects; both teams, however, are hoping that these changes will have a positive impact on their playoff success and the future of their development.Also Read: NHL Injury Update: Mats Zuccarello and Jake Middleton placed on injured reserve; Aube-Kubel and Matt Kiersted called up by Minnesota Wild","Edmonton traded Stuart Skinner, Brett Kulak, and their second-round pick in 2029 for goaltender Tristan Jarry and forward Sam Poulin.

Utah’s Situation and Game Stakes

Ja Morant’s potential return has become the dominant focus as the Memphis Grizzlies prepare for a crucial home contest against the Utah Jazz on December 12, 2025. With Memphis fighting to climb out of an early-season hole and the Jazz continuing to struggle, the superstar guard’s status injects rare midseason suspense into a matchup carrying both standings weight and emotional energy at FedExForum.The Memphis Grizzlies have rediscovered their rhythm during Morant’s absence, winning seven of their last ten games while showcasing unexpected depth from rookies and role players. Still, the possibility of the franchise face stepping back onto the court has turned local buzz into full-blown anticipation, especially with the team sitting at 11-13 and eyeing a potential surge.Ja Morant remains officially listed as questionable due to a right calf strain that has kept him out of the past 10 games. He last appeared on November 15 against the Cleveland Cavaliers before the lingering issue shut him down, limiting him to just 12 outings so far. Encouragingly, he completed a full practice without restrictions on Thursday, prompting head coach Tuomas Iisalo to label his progress as promising while emphasizing that the final decision hinges on how Morant’s body responds closer to tip-off.Both the 9:30 AM and 11:30 AM ET league injury reports maintained his questionable designation, with no upgrade issued by late evening IST.Despite the uncertainty, the momentum toward a return has built steady optimism among fans.Before the injury pause, ja Morant averaged 17.9 points, 3.5 rebounds, and 7.6 assists. His efficiency, however, lagged at 35.9 percent from the field and 16.7 percent from three, numbers expected to normalize as he re-establishes rhythm. In his absence, rookies Cam Spencer (11.1 points, 3.9 assists) and Jaylen Wells have taken on larger roles, helping Memphis improve an offense that still ranks just 25th in overall rating.The Memphis Grizzlies continue to battle a lengthy injury list beyond Morant:Jaren Jackson Jr. remains available despite recent scoring struggles.Utah enters the contest undermanned as well, missing Walker Kessler (season-ending left shoulder surgery), Georges Niang (left foot stress reaction), and several players on G League assignments. The Jazz hold an 8-15 record and continue searching for stability.Also read: Is LaMelo Ball playing tonigh vs the Chicago Bulls?

Jalen Hurts & Bry Burrows’ Combined Net Worth: Inside the wealth of the Philadelphia Eagles’ power couple,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/jalen-hurts-bry-burrows-combined-net-worth-inside-the-wealth-of-the-philadelphia-eagles-power-couple/articleshow/125936420.cms,"Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts stands with fiancée Bry Burrows during a public appearance following the Eagles’ Super Bowl win. (Image via Getty)

How Jalen Hurts turned a second-round pick into a $50 million fortune

Jalen Hurts’ contract and endorsements keep his net worth climbing

Rookie deal: four years, $6,025,171

Extension: five years, $255 million

Bry Burrows’ IBM salary and low profile add another $4-6 million

Bry Burrows is not the richest NFL WAG, but she holds real money next to Jalen Hurts

Jalen Hurts is not just carrying the Philadelphia Eagles. He is also one half of a money-heavy, very intentional power couple. With Hurts’ net worth sitting at about $50 million and Bry Burrows’ wealth estimated between $4 million and $6 million, the two are working with a combined financial range of roughly $54 million to $56 million, based on recent public estimates from Celebrity Net Worth and Times of India.On one side you have a Super Bowl-winning quarterback with a record-setting contract and a long endorsement list. On the other, an IBM artificial intelligence partner who earns seven figures on her own terms and wants nothing to do with the “loud NFL WAG” template. Together, they are building a money and status profile that looks very different from the usual quarterback-influencer pairing.Hurts’ money starts with the part everyone sees: his rise from a second-round pick to one of the highest-paid quarterbacks in football. The Philadelphia Eagles took him 53rd overall in the 2020 NFL Draft, at a time when Carson Wentz was still in the building and Hurts looked like a backup plan more than a franchise face.His rookie contract reflected that status. Hurts signed a four-year deal worth just over $6 million, including a $1.9 million signing bonus and $2.8 million guaranteed. His base salaries in those first seasons were modest for a starting quarterback: $610,000 in 2020, $883,000 in 2021, and $1 million in 2022.He was still one of the cheaper starting quarterbacks in the league when he led the Eagles to a Super Bowl appearance after the 2022 season.That run changed everything. Hurts played his way into franchise-quarterback money and cashed it in. In April 2023, he agreed to a five-year extension worth $255 million with Philadelphia. The deal, which started with the 2024 season, briefly set the standard for quarterback contracts and came with $180 million fully guaranteed and an average annual value of $50 million.A detailed breakdown from Teddy Ricketson shows how front-loaded and cap-managed the deal is, with a small base salary and bigger cap hits pushed into future years through void years that run through 2032. In 2024, Hurts’ base salary is just over $1.1 million with a cap hit of about $13.5 million. That cap number climbs above $21 million in 2025 and continues to rise into the 2030s even after the main years of the deal end, thanks to the Eagles spreading out the financial hit.On the field, Hurts has matched that investment. He took the Eagles to a Super Bowl in the 2022 season, earned Pro Bowl and second-team All-Pro honors in 2022, and then helped deliver the franchise’s second Super Bowl win with a victory over the Kansas City Chiefs on Feb. 9, 2025. The résumé is now tracking with the money.Off the field, the numbers are just as aggressive. As of February 2025, Celebrity Net Worth estimates Hurts’ net worth at $50 million. That figure includes his NFL earnings and a growing endorsement portfolio that already looks like a veteran quarterback’s list.Hurts’ deal with the Eagles is the backbone of his net worth, but his off-field work is built to match it. Ricketson’s breakdown lists his total NFL money across two contracts:On top of that, Hurts is already pulling in a long list of sponsorships. He has worked with Columbia Sportswear, EastBay, Gillette, Hulu, Jordan Brand, Kellogg, Keurig, Lemon Perfect, Lincoln Financial Group, Oakley, Pepsi, and Sprite. Those are not fringe brands. They are household companies tying themselves to his image at a relatively early stage of his prime.What makes Hurts stand out in this space is how he has set up the people around him. He works with an all-female management group that runs his football business, marketing, PR, and media.His agent, Nicole Lynn, is the most visible face of that structure. She graduated from Oklahoma’s College of Law in 2015 and built her reputation by becoming the first Black female agent to represent a first-round pick when the New York Jets drafted Quinnen Williams in 2019. Speaking to Glamour in 2019, she said, “It’s such an uphill battle to be a sports agent in general, and more difficult being a woman, and I would say two times as difficult being a Black woman and under the age of 30. I never really listened to the noise — and there was a lot of it. I think that is one of the reasons I am where I am.”Lynn reached out to Hurts in his college days and pitched herself bluntly. Hurts told Sports Illustrated, “I saw that same fire in Nicole. She said, ‘I’m a woman. People are going to overlook me. People are going to doubt me. They’re not going to give me the due respect. But I’m overcoming it, just like you do.’ And that’s where we really hit it off. We had the same vision.”Lynn later became President of Football at Klutch Sports Group in 2023. Around her, Hurts’ team includes Chantal Roman for media relations, Shakeemah Simmons-Winter for PR, Rachel Everett for marketing, and Jenna Malphrus for management. Hurts has talked publicly about being intentional in hiring women and backing women in sports and business.So his half of the couple’s net worth is not just big. It is structured. Long-term money, spread-out cap hits, steady endorsements, and a management team that looks built for a lengthy run rather than a quick cash grab.Bryonna Rivera “Bry” Burrows is not living off Hurts’ contract. Times of India reports that her personal net worth sits between $4 million and $6 million, driven by her work as an artificial intelligence partner at IBM. That range alone would put her ahead of many NFL players who never land a second contract.Bry’s career is old-fashioned corporate grind, not reality TV. According to that same reporting, she has worked her way up inside IBM as a senior client experience consultant, sales executive, and software financing leader before stepping into her current AI partner role. Her job focuses on helping clients use AI to change how they operate, cut costs, and open new lines of business.The money attached to that kind of position lines up with her net worth range. She has not disclosed side businesses or public endorsement deals, even though she could easily leverage her connection to an NFL star. That choice is the point. Burrows has kept her income streams focused on actual work instead of leaning into NIL-style branding.The same profile shows how she and Hurts fit together. They met at the University of Alabama, where Hurts began his college career. Burrows graduated from Alabama as well. The two stayed connected as his football journey moved from Alabama to Oklahoma and then to the NFL. Times of India notes they got engaged in September 2024, and she is now regularly seen supporting him at major events, including his Super Bowl win against the Chiefs.On social media, she is present without being loud. She has an Instagram account, @brys.ig, but has kept a far lower profile than many other partners of star quarterbacks. That is a choice, not a lack of leverage.The easy narrative here would be to label Burrows the richest NFL WAG. The numbers do not support that. Times of India is clear: her $4-6 million net worth does not lead the pack.The same breakdown points to Brittany Mahomes, who sits in the $10-15 million range according to outlets like Marca and StyleCaster. Brittany’s money comes from owning Brittany Lynne Fitness, co-owning the Kansas City Current, and using a large Instagram platform to pull in brand deals with companies such as Alani Nu and Shop Vitality. That is a different lane entirely.Burrows is not trying to beat that lane. Her income is corporate, her social media is controlled, and her visibility is selective. Even so, a $4-6 million net worth while working as an AI partner at a major tech company puts her in rare space compared to most people, including many athletes’ partners.Put that next to Hurts’ $50 million net worth, and the couple is sitting on combined wealth in the mid-eight figures, all before Hurts’ current contract and Burrows’ tech career have fully played out.","Jalen Hurts is one half of a money-heavy, very intentional power couple. Hurts’ net worth sits at about $50 million and Bry Burrows’ wealth estimated between $4 million and $6 million. The two are working with a combined financial range of roughly $54 million to $56 million.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125936545,imgsize-44836,width-400,resizemode-4/jalen-hurts-bry-burrows-combined-net-worth.jpg"

MUMBAI: The scourge of match-fixing has hit cricket, or more specifically, Indian domestic cricket, again. In a sensational development, the Assam Cricket Association secretary Sanatan Das informed the media on Friday that it had suspended four of its players — Amit Sinha, Ishan Ahmed, Aman Tripathi and Abhishek Thakuri — with immediate effect after allegations emerged that ""they were involved in corrupt practices relating to the game of cricket"" during the league stage of the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 Trophy.""The above four players, who have represented Assam at various stages, are accused of influencing and attempting to instigate some of the current Assam team players, who took part in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy 2025 held in Lucknow from Nov 26 to Dec 8. Following the emergence of these allegations, the Anti-Corruption and Security Unit (ACSU) of the BCCI conducted an enquiry. The ACA has also initiated criminal proceedings. Prima facie, there appears to be involvement of the aforementioned four players in serious misconduct, affecting the integrity of the sports,"" Das stated in the release on Friday.The ACA stated that it had also lodged an FIR at the Crime Branch, Guwahati, against the four players on Friday. The ACA, incidentally, happens to be the home association of BCCI secretary Devajit Saikia. ""The BCCI follows a zero tolerance policy regarding any kind of misdeeds or corrupt practices by any of the players, irrespective of which state they come from.Our anti-corruption unit is quite efficient to find out these kind of activities which is indulged by some players or bookies. We will continue our drive against those kind of persons who are involved in trying to malign the game of cricket,"" Saikia told TOI. ""We will not allow that to happen. As I said, our (anti-corruption) team is very efficient and is constantly working on this,"" he added.Placed in Elite Group A, Assam, captained by India allrounder Riyan Parag, finished seventh out of eight teams, winning three games and losing four out of the seven matches they played in the competition. None of these four players accused of ""indulging in corrupt practices"" were a part of the Assam team in SMAT 2025.Amit Sinha, a batsman, has featured in 32 first-class matches (1208 runs at 22.79), 46 List A games and 31 T20s for Assam. Thakuri, a wicket-keeper batsman, has played 12 first-class matches (451 runs at 23.73), including two Ranji Trophy matches this season, besides having represented Assam in 11 List A and 10 T20s.""There was no particular match in which they were in fixing. These players were not there in the Assam squad for SMAT. They (allegedly) approached our team's players with an intention of fixing. Those players approached the Assam captain (Riyan Parag), who reported it to the BCCI's anti-corruption & Security unit. The BCCI's ACSU investigated it and found that something was foul in the case. After conducting an investigation, the BCCI's ACSU reported the matter to us. We have therefore suspended all these (accused) four players. If the names of more players emerge in the investigation (of the BCCI's ACSU), then we will take action against them too. As of now, these four players have been found to be involved (in making a corrupt approach). They have admitted to us that they tried to make these corrupt approaches about producing a certain 'performance' from the players,"" ACA president Taranga Gogoi told TOI from Guwahati.""We are all completely against corruption in cricket,"" he added.The ACA secretary stated: ""The suspension of the players was done to curtail any scope of further deterioration of the situation. Accordingly, during the suspension period, the players are barred from: Taking part in any State-level tournament or match conducted under the Assam Cricket Association, District Units or affiliated clubs. Participating in any cricket-related activity, including officiating as match referee, coach, umpire etc. The suspension will continue til the final outcome of the investigation and/or any further decision of the Association. All District Associations are directed to ensure strict compliance with this order and to inform clubs and cricket academies under their jurisdiction for the necessary action.""""The ACA reiterates its commitment to safeguarding the integrity and spirit of the sport and will continue to uphold the highest standards of transparency, discipline and ethical conduct,"" concluded Das' statement.","Assam Cricket Association suspends four of its players over match-fixing allegations.

Vaibhav Sooryavanshi showcased an extraordinary performance in the U-19 Asia Cup match against UAE in Dubai on Wednesday, scoring 171 runs off just 95 balls. His remarkable innings helped India post a massive total of 433/6 in their allocated 50 overs.The 14-year-old left-handed batsman from Bihar set a new world record in U-19 cricket by hitting fourteen sixes and nine fours during his innings.During the 32nd over of India's innings, when Sooryavanshi was approaching his century, an interesting exchange occurred between him and UAE wicketkeeper Saleh Amin.""Come on boys. 90's curse. 90's curse,"" Amin was heard saying on the stump mic.""Tere saath selfie loon? (Wanna take selfie with me?)"" Sooryavanshi responded to the UAE wicketkeeper.When asked about the incident later, Sooryavanshi responded confidently: ""Main Bihar se hoon. Peeth peeche jo bhi baatein hoti hain, usse mujhko farak nahi padta."" (I am from Bihar. What is said behind my back does not bother me.)The match began with UAE captain Yayin Rai winning the toss and asking India to bat first. India faced an early setback when captain Ayush Mhatre was dismissed for just four runs in the third over.Sooryavanshi then joined forces with Aaron George at the crease. The young batsman initially played with caution before accelerating his innings, reaching his fifty in just 30 balls.His powerful hitting display earned him a new tournament record for most sixes in a single innings in the U-19 Asia Cup. He surpassed the previous record of ten sixes set by Afghanistan's Darwish Rasooli in 2017.Sooryavanshi continued his aggressive batting, reaching his century in 56 balls. He maintained his momentum to score 150 runs in 84 balls before being run out after scoring 171 runs. His innings came at an impressive strike rate of 180.The innings now stands as the second-highest score by an Indian in Youth ODI cricket. The record is still held by Ambati Rayudu, who scored an unbeaten 177 against England U-19 in 2002.The Indian innings was well supported by Aaron George and Vihaan Malhotra, who both scored 69 runs each. Vedant Trivedi contributed 38 runs, while Abhigyan Kundu and Kanishk Chouhan added 32 and 28 runs, respectively.The combined effort helped India set an enormous target of 434 runs for the UAE team.UAE's response resulted in a score of 199/7 in their allocated 50 overs.

Messi Lands In Kolkata At 2.26am, City Erupts As GOAT India Tour Sparks Midnight Frenzy Scenes Now!

Sleepless wait ends in disappointment

High hopes

The Itinerary

Kolkata's tryst with footballers

Thousands braved the December chill and stayed up well past midnight to give Argentine football icon Lionel Messi a thunderous welcome as he arrived in Kolkata for his whirlwind three-day, four-city GOAT India Tour 2025. The Barcelona legend touched down at 2.26 am on Saturday, triggering scenes of frenzy across the city. Gate 4 of the international arrivals transformed into a sea of chants, flags and flashing phone cameras, with fans dashing between gates in the hope of catching even a fleeting glimpse of their hero.Children sat atop shoulders, drums beat loudly, and chants rang out as Messi was swiftly escorted through the VIP gate amid heavy security. A tightly guarded convoy then ferried him to his hotel, where another massive crowd waited through the night.Barricades, police deployment and non-stop cheering turned the city into a cauldron of what many called pure “Messi mania”.Messi arrived alongside long-time strike partner Luis Suárez and Argentina teammate Rodrigo De Paul. Over the next 72 hours, he is set to travel to Kolkata, Hyderabad, Mumbai and Delhi, meeting chief ministers, corporate leaders, Bollywood celebrities and Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday.For many fans who kept vigil through the night, the wait ended in heartbreak as they failed to catch a glimpse of the Argentine great.Due to tight security arrangements, Messi was whisked out of the airport around 3.30 am and taken to his hotel via a back entrance, leaving hundreds of supporters disappointed.Only a select few airport staff managed a fleeting look at Messi as he stepped off the private Gulfstream V, dressed sharply in a black suit over a white T-shirt, before being driven straight off the tarmac.Scenes turned chaotic at the Hyatt Regency as fans sprinted through corridors chanting “Messi! Messi!”, with the echoes carrying well into the early hours of dawn.The hotel lobby resembled an Argentine fan zone, awash with sky-blue jerseys, scarves and flags. Breast-feeding infants clung to mothers, children ran around excitedly, while exhausted fans slumped on sofas as the buzz intensified.Messi checked into Room 730, with the entire seventh floor sealed to prevent any movement near his suite.With security at its tightest, some fans booked rooms at the hotel in a bid to stay as close to Messi as possible.A family from New Alipore checked in a day early so their son, Krish Gupta, a Cristiano Ronaldo fan, would not miss the moment.""I'm a die-hard Ronaldo fan, so what? His biggest rival is coming to my city and I cannot miss the moment. So we planned to stay in the hotel a day in advance,"" said Krish, a Class 9 student of Birla High School.He wandered around the coffee shop with his mother and elder sister, hoping for a glimpse of the icon.""I just want to tell him to play football with me. And if I'm not successful, I will go to the gym tomorrow morning to catch a glimpse of him. I have my autograph book ready and hopefully I will get a selfie.""Satadru Dutta, the sole promoter of the tour who received Messi at the airport, described the occasion as historic for Kolkata.""In 2011, he had come after becoming the captain, but now he is coming after winning the World Cup and his eighth Ballon d'Or. So, this is really special. I don't think he will come again, so it's about celebration,"" Dutta told reporters.He added that Messi’s visit could provide a major boost to Indian football.""Never ever have so many sponsors come together for a football star. You can say this is for Messi, but even if 10 per cent of that money comes to the development of Indian football, it would be very big. This statue that has come up and will be unveiled in the morning is also the first-of-its-kind in the world. Messi is set to leave a legacy behind this time,"" he said.Security was tightened across the city ahead of the GOAT India Tour, with policemen stationed at every crossing, sniffer dogs deployed and heightened surveillance around the hotel.Hotel staff were busy with themed preparations, including two large three-tier fondant cakes in Christmas colours.Outside the airport and later near the hotel, crowds braved the winter cold to welcome Messi, waving Argentina flags and jerseys, chanting his name and breaking down in tears as emotions ran high.The Hyatt Regency emerged as the epicentre of the celebrations, with street vendors selling scarves, flags and Messi No. 10 jerseys.Some fans even turned up in wigs and full Argentine colours. ""This is a lifetime opportunity. We will not sleep tonight and will head straight to the stadium in the morning. Today is celebration day,"" said one supporter.Messi begins his GOAT India Tour on Saturday with a sponsors’ meet-and-greet before heading to the Salt Lake Stadium for a tribute programme featuring music, dance and an exhibition match between Mohun Bagan ‘Messi’ All Stars and Diamond Harbour ‘Messi’ All Stars.He is scheduled to arrive at 10.50 am for interactions with both teams, felicitation of Bengal’s Santosh Trophy-winning side and a “Master Class with Messi” for children. Luis Suárez, Rodrigo De Paul and Shah Rukh Khan will be part of the programme, with Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and other dignitaries invited.Messi will then take a lap of honour before a virtual unveiling of his 70-foot statue at Lake Town.He departs for Hyderabad at 2.05 pm for an evening event at the Rajiv Gandhi Stadium, which includes a short exhibition match, a five-minute appearance by Telangana Chief Minister Revanth Reddy, a football clinic and felicitation.The tour continues to Mumbai for an event at the Wankhede, featuring a 45-minute philanthropic fashion show with Suárez and De Paul, preceded by a Padel Cup at the CCI.The final leg in Delhi will see Messi meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Minerva Academy’s triple youth-trophy winners will be felicitated, followed by a nine-a-side celebrity match.Kolkata’s romance with football royalty dates back to 1977, when Pele’s New York Cosmos played out a 2-2 draw against Mohun Bagan at Eden Gardens.Pele returned in 2015 to greet the class of ’77, telling the crowd: ""You can never have another Pele.""Brazil’s Dunga, Bebeto and Mauro Silva, and Colombia’s René Higuita, who showcased his famous scorpion-kick saves in 2012, all drew massive crowds. German great Oliver Kahn’s 2008 farewell match at Salt Lake Stadium attracted more than one lakh spectators.However, few stirred the city like Diego Maradona, whose visits in 2008 and 2017 saw unprecedented turnouts. Uruguay’s Diego Forlán, fresh from his Golden Ball triumph, received a similarly warm welcome in 2010.In 2011, Messi himself had visited Kolkata, captaining Argentina for the first time on foreign soil and leading them to a 1-0 win over Venezuela in a FIFA international friendly before a packed Salt Lake Stadium.","Messi lands in Kolkata at 2.26am, triggering scenes of frenzy across the city.

The Inside Story Behind India’s World Cup Win: Shafali & Deepti Reveal WPL'S IMPACT

: Since his return to India’s T20 fold as vice-captain, Shubman Gill has endured a lean run. The 26-year old was dismissed for a golden duck in the second T20I versus South Africa. At a time when critics are openly questioning his place in the side, Gill has received a strong vote of confidence from Gujarat Titans head coach Ashish Nehra, who has backed the franchise’s captain to come good and urged observers not to reduce a player of Gill’s quality to mere numbers.Nehra said, “Look, the player you are talking about, (even) if the IPL was three weeks away, I wouldn’t be worried. You’re talking about the T20 format. And there are only two matches played with South Africa. This is our problem. In such a fast-paced format, whether it is international cricket or IPL, if we start evaluating players like Gill after two-three matches, it will be difficult.“You have options. You can remove Abhishek Sharma and Shubman Gill. You can open with Sai Sudharsan and Ruturaj Gaikwad. If you want to remove them, you can do it with Washington Sundar and Ishan Kishan.Options are always there if there are talks about changing players after not-good stats. But aise karoge to bahut mushkil hogi (such a move will lead to difficulties).”Another GT India player facing scrutiny is off-spinning allrounder Washington Sundar. He took just one wicket in the two-Test series against South Africa while scoring 124 runs at 31. In the ODIs, he managed only 14 runs at an average of 7 and returned 0/46 in seven overs. Sundar has not found a place in the XI in the ongoing T20Is. Rubbishing talk that GT were seeking to trade Sundar, Nehra highlighted the Tamil Nadu allrounder’s value with both bat and ball.“Sundar, the kind of skill set he has, he can bat at whatever number you want him to. Now, since he is playing in all three formats, he will gain confidence. It also depends on the conditions. If there is a little help from the pitch, then Sundar is the full package. But he’s not a finished product. He’ll get better from here. He’s only 25–26 years old and has been in the system for so many years,” Nehra said.",Shubman Gill has endured a lean run since his return to India’s T20 fold as vice-captain.

NEW CHANDIGARH:

Ryan ten Doeschate backs under-fire Suryakumar Yadav, Shubman Gill to regain form

The Indian team came into this T20I series against South Africa with the clear objective of identifying the chinks in the T20 team, with just another five games remaining at home against New Zealand leading up to the T20 World Cup in Feb-March.Instead, a new problem has emerged — the leadership group in the team is woefully short of runs and there seems to be no clear way out.The question needs to be asked: Are captain Suryakumar Yadav and vice-captain Shubman Gill becoming misfits in the playing XI because of their prolonged slump? Gill’s return to the T20I playing XI at the expense of Sanju Samson at the top of the order is unending. The bigger worry, however, is Surya’s prolonged run of poor form since assuming full time T20I captaincy after displacing Hardik Pandya.Since Gautam Gambhir took charge as head coach, there have been many changes in the T20I outfit, especially the emergence of Abhishek Sharma and Tilak Varma and the resurgence of Varun Chakravarthy. The shift happened when most of the country's top resources — which includes the likes of Shubman Gill, Kuldeep Yadav, Jasprit Bumrah and Yashasvi Jaiswal — were assigned Test cricket duties.Consumed by the euphoria of this new-look T20I team’s fresh and aggressive brand of cricket, symptoms of Surya’s declining returns went largely unnoticed. That he came out to bat at No. 4 after Axar Patel against a potent South African seam attack on Thursday was a giveaway that the team management is now unsure about Surya’s capability to deliver when it matters.Since November 2024, Surya’s average has been 13.35 at a strike rate of 120 in 20 outings. Those numbers don’t fit the team’s bill. From being dismissive about his form in the Asia Cup a couple of months back, Surya has gone to conceding that he and Gill will have to take more responsibility and not just depend on Abhishek.India’s assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate hinted that both Surya and Gill were perhaps not playing with the mindset that the team expects of them. “If you’re going to be India’s No. 3, there’s pressure on you to score runs. There’s been a fairly long run of form now where he hasn’t got the scores we would like.“Batting at No. 3, the job we want for him is to go out there and attack. He’s been a fantastic leader of this group,” Doeschate said after the defeat in the second T20I here on Thursday night.As for Gill, his T20I approach has been a bit concerning. The sudden promotion to a prominent leadership role may have burdened him with many new responsibilities.“With Shubman, taking up the captaincy the way he did in England, seeing how well he led and how much pride he took in that performance, I think an element of that carried over into what he wanted to do in the T20I side. If anything, he was too caring and maybe a little bit too tight,” Doeschate said.“Towards the back end of the Australia tour, the talk was about freeing up a little bit more, try to relinquish that responsibility, certainly in that capacity where you feel like it’s all about you and you really need to justify your place in the team. We don’t want him to do that. We want him to play as freely as he does during IPL seasons,” he added.Just after the high of the T20 World Cup win in 2024, Indian cricket rushed towards an inevitable transition. Some tough calls were taken, especially in assigning leadership roles across formats.Both Gill and Surya were catapulted to the captaincy ahead of men in queue. As Doeschate said, it may have started to play on their minds, leading to constant anxiety to prove their worth as leaders.“About the leadership roles, we’re quite far down the road now with our planning and you know how we have set the team up,” Doeschate said. However, the team management, in its rush to prove its flexible approach, has often made whimsical moves, like Axar Patel’s promotion on Thursday night to No. 3, which meant two left handers were at the crease, which goes against most T20 match-up theories.“We’ve got eight games now before the World cup. Frankly, we found ourselves being 35/3 more times than we would have liked in the last couple of months. It’s just a exploration into how we can extend the batting,” Doeschate explained. But it also leaves one wondering if the team management has enough faith in proper batters to do the job at the top. Shielding the captain may not be the best idea.The Indian team management took harsh calls in 2024 hoping things would stabilise by the 2026 T20 World Cup. It’s just the men they put behind the wheels to steer the team out of choppy waters are in turmoil. With two months and eight games to go, the best the team management could do is define roles and bring stability.","Ryan ten Doeschate backs under-fire Suryakumar Yadav, Shubman Gill to regain form.

NEW DELHI: Out of India's T20 setup, Indian men's cricket team fast bowler Mohammed Siraj on Friday delivered an stunning performance in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, taking three wickets against the star-studded Mumbai side.The presence of a clutch of India stars failed to inspire Mumbai as they went down to Hyderabad in their Super League match of the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy in Pune.Mumbai had Yashasvi Jaiswal (29), Sarfaraz Khan (5), Ajinkya Rahane (9) and Shardul Thakur (0) in their line-up but folded for 131 as India pacer Mohammed Siraj took three for 17 in 3.5 overs for Hyderabad.Siraj opened his wicket account by taking Suryansh Shedge’s catch of his own bowling in the 17th over of Mumbai’s innings, and then on the next ball of that same over, he trapped Mumbai skipper Shardul Thakur in front of the wickets.Shardul, who will play for Mumbai Indians in IPL 2026 after joining them in a trade deal from Lucknow Super Giants, failed to open his account.Siraj’s third wicket came in the form of Tanush Kotian. Kotian could only manage to score 2 runs from five balls.Hyderabad chased down the target of 132 easily in just 11.5 overs, and won the match by 9 wickets.Mohammed Siraj won the Player of the Match award.Siraj last played for India in T20Is in July 2024 against Sri Lanka in Pallekele.","Mohammed Siraj takes three wickets for Hyderabad in Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy match.
