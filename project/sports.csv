LeBron James details first knee injury of his life, which made him miss the Met Gala

The Los Angeles Lakers ' season wrapped up with a disappointment. And the small losses aside, the biggest regret for the team's loyalists is the fact that another season just went by where LeBron James' prime has gone to waste as he had to move aside after sustaining a knee injury. LeBron suffered a Grade 2 MCL sprain in his left knee from his collision with DiVincenzo in Game 5, and during a recent appearance on a podcast, he revealed he hinted at his retirement.In fact, as per some rumours, James may become a free agent this summer, but retirement is also a possibility. The star has spoken extensively about this decision in recent offseasons, and it appears that the end of his career is approaching.This season, James averaged 24.4 points, 7.8 rebounds, and 8.2 assists, and many experts believe that the next season might even be his final. It's no secret that James' 2025 season was cut short due to a knee injury, which even made him skip the Met Gala. On the latest episode of the 'Mind the Game' podcast with Steve Nash, LeBron revealed something surprising.King James, as he's fondly known as admitted that this is the first knee injury of his life! ""In my 22-year career, this is my first knee injury. I've had regular tendonitis, patella, all that stuff, but this is the first time I have had a sustained knee injury where you gotta get off your feet. You gotta be shelved for a minute,"" he said.He further explained, ""I knew when the impact happened between me and DiVincenzo, my knee locked up. That's why I stayed on the ground. If the knee would release a little bit, but I knew right then and there with the pain that I had never felt before... My knee bent inward, and that's the MCL injury I picked up. The doc told me that it would take four to six weeks. I have four to six weeks now.""""Even if we won Game 5, I would have missed 6 and 7, and even further. I have some time now to get it right and get back to full strength,"" he added.LeBron disclosed that he was prepared to wait until Friday for an MRI after sustaining the injury on Wednesday, but the pain he experienced upon waking on Thursday made him move up the imaging appointment. LeBron also mentioned retirement during the podcast and shared that he would make this decision with his family after the Lakers' final game of the season.""I haven't had the conversation with the family yet as far as me going forward or whatever the case may be,"" the 40-year-old said during Thursday's episode of Mind the Game with Steve Nash (35:25 mark). ""But we'll see what happens.""",LeBron James suffered a Grade 2 MCL sprain in his left knee from his collision with DiVincenzo in Game 5.

“War has been chosen by Pakistan when they had an opportunity to keep quiet. They have escalated to save its terrorist assets, speaks so much about them. Our forces will reply in the most appropriate manner—a manner Pakistan will never forget.”

Geopolitical tensions spilled into the world of cricket on Thursday evening after the IPL 2025 match between Punjab Kings and Delhi Capitals at the HPCA Stadium in Dharamsala was called off midway due to escalating cross-border tensions between India and Pakistan. In a rapid response, players, support staff, and spectators were asked to evacuate the stadium immediately.Former India cricketer Virender Sehwag , known for his outspoken views, took to social media shortly after the incident, posting:The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) swiftly moved into action following the sudden suspension of the game. BCCI vice-president Rajeev Shukla confirmed that arrangements had been made to safely evacuate players and officials from the region.It is understood that players from both franchises have safely returned to their hotel and at the time of reporting, were notified of a special train to evacuate them from the city. Sources close to the teams reveal that unease had already crept in earlier in the day, with security concerns looming large over the fixture.Adding to the uncertainty, both teams had already reached Dharamsala before the closure of nearby airports, which left their exit from the region in limbo until a special train was arranged.With panic temporarily gripping the IPL, the BCCI now faces the challenge of reassessing the schedule and possibly relocating fixtures, depending on how the situation unfolds in the next 24 hours.

Will Johnson's slide turned personal and NFL might pay for it



Will Johnson | Episode 3 | The NFL Draft

“They gon have to pay for this sh*t, I promise you. Arizona finna get a dawg,”

Will Johnson brings the attitude and edge Arizona needs



The Arizona Cardinals didn’t just draft a cornerback in the second round—they lit a fire under a young man with something to prove. While their first-round pick, Walter Nolen, satisfied the need for a disruptive force up front, it’s their next move that could shake up the league. When Arizona scooped up Michigan’s Will Johnson with pick No. 35, it wasn’t just a calculated risk.It was a potential franchise-altering moment.Will Johnson wasn’t supposed to be sitting there on Day 2. Not after the career he had at Michigan. Not after locking down top receivers and helping lead the Wolverines to a national championship. He was smart, physical, and polished by most accounts, a first-round lock.But a flagged knee at the NFL Combine changed everything.Suddenly, teams got cold feet. Some erased him from their draft boards entirely. Others just didn’t want to be the ones to take the gamble. Arizona had their eyes on him. They weren’t worried, they were prepared and so was Johnson.he told reporters shortly after being picked.That’s not just post-draft emotion talking. That’s a message one aimed squarely at every single team that passed on him. He knows where he went. He knows who overlooked him. And now, he’s got all the motivation in the world to turn that slide into a legacy.What the Cardinals are getting is more than a corner with good tape. Johnson plays angry in the best way possible. He’s aggressive at the line, doesn’t shy away from physical matchups, and has the instincts of a veteran. Arizona’s secondary needed an attitude. Johnson brings that in spades.Also Read: Kayla Nicole slams critics still calling her ‘Travis Kelce’s Ex’ — When will we stop defining women by the men they dated? The knee will be something to monitor. But in the eyes of the Cardinals' front office, the upside outweighed the risk and then some. They didn’t see damaged goods. They saw a first-round talent with an edge. And if Johnson stays healthy, they may have just pulled off the biggest steal of the draft.","The Arizona Cardinals picked Michigan cornerback Will Johnson in the second round of the NFL draft.

Stephen Curry prioritizes recovery amid playoff pressures

During the high-pressure NBA playoffs, the desire to ignore pain is strong. Still, Stephen Curry of the Golden State Warriors is prioritizing caution over impulse. After he got a Grade 1 left hamstring strain in Game 1 against the Minnesota Timberwolves, Curry spoke honestly about the urge to return too soon. 'I'm not rushing back,' he remarked, aware of how misleading these injuries can be.His decision reflects a dedication to his long-term health instead of short-term success, even while his team competes without him.Stephen Curry got hurt early in Game 1, scoring 13 points in just 13 minutes before leaving the game. An MRI showed he has a Grade 1 hamstring strain, which will keep him out for at least a week. This is the first muscle strain of his impressive career, making his recovery a bit more complicated. Even though the Warriors won 99-88, missing their star point guard is a big deal as the series moves on.Addressing the media, Curry expressed a measured approach to his rehabilitation. He said, “This is new and from all that or all that I'm learning about how quickly you can get back. There has to be a healing process that is just the way the body works. You can't accelerate it more than what it's telling you. So go be one of those after a week like really reevaluating every day to kind of understand when it's safe, just even think about playing, let alone like how much can you push it?”While Curry is sidelined, the Warriors are counting on their depth and experience. Jimmy Butler, who was brought in during the season, has really shined, picking up the nickname 'Playoff Jimmy' for his postseason performance. Buddy Hield continues to dazzle, adding 24 points and eight rebounds in Game 1 against Minnesota after his impressive 33-point showing in Game 7 against the Rockets. Veteran Draymond Green is making a big impact, offering leadership and versatility on both ends of the floor.Coach Steve Kerr has tweaked the lineup to cover for Curry not being around, bringing in guys like Gary Payton II for defense and giving more playing time to bench players like Pat Spencer and Quinten Post. This smart move is all about keeping the team strong while they wait for Curry to come back.Also Read: Steve Kerr's hilarious reaction to Buddy Hield's uniform mix-up during Warriors' Game 1 win over Timberwolves Even though the Warriors are struggling without their key player, their strong roster and grit provide a silver lining.

Michael Penix Jr. faces his biggest test yet



The Atlanta Falcons didn’t just adjust their quarterback strategy, they blew it up. Kirk Cousins was supposed to be the answer, the veteran stabilizer. Instead, his time under center barely got off the ground before the franchise hit the reset button. In a bold and unexpected move, Atlanta has turned the spotlight to Michael Penix Jr ., a second-year QB with limited experience but unlimited expectations.Penix’s rookie season was short but promising. He started just three games and recorded 114 dropbacks, not much, statistically speaking. But what he did show has people talking. He posted an 87.6 passing grade, a 9.0% big-time throw rate, and a 1.7% turnover-worthy play rate, all ranking among the top five for QBs with 100+ dropbacks in 2024. That’s enough to get fans excited. But is it enough to hand him the keys to the entire franchise?Atlanta isn’t waiting to find out the slow way. They’re throwing Penix into the fire giving him a stacked offense with Bijan Robinson, Drake London, and Kyle Pitts, and expecting results now. The potential is there, no doubt. But can he turn potential into consistency over a full season?Off the field, Penix is already making waves with his confidence. When asked about when he takes off his durag, his response made headlines: “You gotta catch me at like a dinner with Arthur Blank .” Fans loved it. He’s cool, composed, and comfortable in the spotlight.Even Falcons legend Matt Ryan seems to believe in him.

Minnesota Timberwolves game summary

The Western Conference Semifinals are getting more interesting. The Minnesota Timberwolves secured another stunning 117-93 win against the Golden State Warriors in a hard-fought battle. While Warriors’ Stephen Curry was out due to injury, the Timberwolves’ Anthony Edwards also gave a scare during tonight's game at the Target Center in Minneapolis. Here is the box score, player stats, and everything you need to know about the Golden State Warriors vs Minnesota Timberwolves matchup on April 8.The game was a tough outing for the Golden State Warriors, with many players struggling to find rhythm and efficiency.Jimmy Butler played 33 minutes and put up 17 points on 6-of-13 shooting. He hit 2-of-4 from three-point range and added 7 rebounds, 4 assists, and a steal. Despite his solid numbers, his impact wasn’t enough to swing the game in their favor, finishing with a -4 plus-minus.Draymond Green had a quieter game offensively, going just 3-of-10 from the field and 1-of-6 from beyond the arc. He contributed in other areas, recording 5 assists, 4 rebounds, a steal, and a block. Buddy Hield played 28 minutes and scored 15 points, making 4-of-9 from three-point land, though he shot only 35.7% overall.

However, he was only 1-of-4 from the free-throw line. Trayce Jackson-Davis was perfect from the field (6-of-6) and added 6 rebounds and 15 points in just 19 minutes. On the flip side, several bench players couldn’t get going — Moses Moody, Pat Spencer, Gary Payton II, and others went scoreless or shot poorly. Moody was 0-of-5 from the floor, while Payton missed both of his attempts.Jaden McDaniels had one of his best performances of the game, shooting 70 percent from the field and finishing with 20 points. He was efficient, going 7-of-10 overall and hitting one of his two three-point attempts. McDaniels also added two rebounds, three blocks, and a steal in his 33 minutes on the floor.Julius Randle looked sharp as well, dropping 24 points on 10-of-17 shooting. He dished out a game-high 11 assists and grabbed seven rebounds, showing his all-around impact. He made all three of his free throws and hit one shot from deep. His performance helped keep the offense flowing, and his +17 plus-minus showed how much the team benefited while he was on the court.Anthony Edwards had a strong night too, scoring 21 points and pulling down nine rebounds. He added five assists and hit two three-pointers while shooting 46.2 percent overall. Edwards also made six of his eight free throw attempts. On the defensive side, he recorded three steals and one block.Also Read: Anthony Edwards shakes off injury scare, returns to lead Minnesota Timberwolves in Game 2 vs Golden State Warriors Nickeil Alexander-Walker provided a big spark off the bench, pouring in 20 points in just over 25 minutes.

Explained: Why Rohit Sharma retired from Test cricket

IPL chairman Arun Dhumal was seen signalling to spectators to evacuate the stadium in Dharamsala on Thursday, as the India-Pakistan tensions escalated and forced the match between Punjab Kings and Delhi Capitals to be abandoned. In the wake of the mid-game cancellation, players and support staff from both sides will now be transported to Delhi via a special train from Pathankot, approximately 85 km away.The match had started after a one-hour delay but was halted abruptly after just 10.1 overs due to a floodlight failure, with only one floodlight tower functioning at the venue.Following a prolonged wait and failed attempts to resolve the issue, officials decided to call off the game. Spectators and officials were promptly evacuated from the ground.A video now viral on social media captures Arun Dhumal walking onto the field and urging the crowd to exit the stadium immediately.Before the interruption, Punjab Kings had made a dominant start. After electing to bat first, openers Prabhsimran Singh (50* off 28) and Priyansh Arya (70 off 34) put together a blistering 122-run partnership. Arya began aggressively, hitting back-to-back boundaries off Mitchell Starc in the opening over. Prabhsimran soon joined the onslaught, smashing Starc for three fours before Arya took on Dushmantha Chameera with a four and two sixes.Despite Axar Patel’s entry in the fifth over, Delhi Capitals couldn’t stem the flow of runs, with Punjab reaching 69/0 at the end of the powerplay.Arya soon reached his fifty off just 25 balls, and PBKS crossed the 100-run mark in just 8.5 overs. He continued his assault, launching Kuldeep Yadav for back-to-back sixes. Prabhsimran followed suit, hitting a boundary and bringing up his fourth consecutive half-century.The opening stand was finally broken when Arya miscued a shot off T. Natarajan and was caught at short third-man. However, before the next delivery could be bowled, players were taken off the field due to the lighting issue. With no resolution in sight, the game was eventually abandoned.",IPL match between Punjab Kings and Delhi Capitals abandoned after just 10.1 overs due to a floodlight failure.

“He wanted to go”- Former Williams’s Dy team principal Claire Williams recalls how she lost George Russell to Mercedes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/formula-one/news/he-wanted-to-go-former-williamss-dy-team-principal-claire-williams-recalls-how-she-lost-george-russell-to-mercedes/articleshow/121016341.cms,"Former Williams’s Dy team principal Claire Williams recalls how she lost George Russell to Mercedes (Image Source: Getty)

Claire Williams says George Russell wanted to go to Mercedes

“George wanted to go to Mercedes in that last couple of years and I couldn't let him go and I hated that, It makes me upset to think about it. I needed him, I felt, more than Mercedes and he was in contract. If I let him go, what message would that have sent? What would that have done to my team if I'd have let George go?”

Claire Williams: Proud of Williams' Progress | F1 Beyond The Grid Podcast

“He was one of the greatest things that we had at Williams. When you go into a negotiation with a team like Mercedes and they're not offering you what they should be for your A-star driver, then why would you just let him go? What kind of Team Principal would I have been if I'd have just let George go because Mercedes said, ‘we want George now’. That's not how it works, is it?”

Claire Williams says George Russell was upset

“[George] was clearly upset and it was really difficult. It was very hard to stand my ground because if someone comes to me and they're upset, and it's because of me because I'm a blocker, it's really hard – but I had to put my team first.

“As much as I would have loved to have made George's dreams come true, I couldn't at the time, and that was one of the hardest parts of being a Team Principal for me. And I always said to George: you will be grateful for this one day because it will build resilience in you, it will build strength.”

With Mercedes F1 driver George Russell almost making it big for himself, podium after podium, the former Williams’ Deputy Team Principal, Claire Williams , recently opened up about how she had tried retaining Russell, but he had plans of joining Mercedes.George Russell had joined F1 in 2019 but didn’t score points early with Williams. While Mercedes was interested in racing Russell, alongside Lewis Hamilton, Claire Williams didn’t want to let him go.She believed Russell was a top driver and stood firm to keep him at the team for as long as possible.While speaking on F1’s Beyond The Grid podcast, Claire revealed:She said:Claire Williams explained that it was a difficult time in her life, knowing that George Russell was upset, and while she had to stand her ground, she couldn’t see him be more upset.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

Watch Zak Brown bring F1 glory days to life with special demo run at 2025 British GP



How Zak Brown started his car collection + the stories behind the vehicles 👏

McLaren CEO Zak Brown is set to give fans a thrilling experience during the 2025 British Grand Prix weekend by taking the iconic 1987 Williams FW11B Formula 1 car for a spin around the Silverstone Circuit. This legendary car, famously driven by Nigel Mansell, has been fully restored and is now ready for its grand return to the track. Brown, who is an avid fan of Formula 1 and IndyCar, shared his excitement about the upcoming event during an exclusive guided tour of his impressive car collection.""I'll take this out at the British Grand Prix this year, which I think the fans are gonna absolutely love. I'm gonna personally take it out. So, I'm gonna drive this next week in Spain as I've never driven it,"" Zak Brown explained, standing next to the stunning 1987 Williams FW11B. His enthusiasm was palpable as he mentioned his upcoming drive in Spain, a vital step before taking it to the British Grand Prix. ""We've just had it fully restored here, it's been shaken down, it's ready to go,"" he added.Brown also reflected on the car's historical significance, noting its role in Mansell's unforgettable performances. ""This is the car... 1987, he won a lot of races. He said this was his favourite car to drive,"" Brown continued. For Formula 1 fans, the FW11B is forever etched in history, especially for its performance in the 1987 British Grand Prix, where Mansell, after suffering a tyre puncture, went on to break the track record by completing 17 consecutive laps. He capped off that stunning performance with a memorable overtaking move on Nelson Piquet to secure victory.The car holds a special place for Brown, who has forged a close friendship with Mansell. ""I've become good friends with Nigel, and he spends a lot of time with Lando,"" Brown shared. His connection to Mansell is personal and professional, as Brown went on to explain how he acquired the car. ""I got this when I did a sponsorship deal for Williams. [They said] 'What can we ever do for you?' I was like 'you can sell me a car!'""The British Grand Prix is known for its tradition of showcasing historic F1 cars, and Brown’s drive in the FW11B will be a standout moment for fans at Silverstone. Last year, former world champion Jenson Button brought the FW22 to life on track during the F1 weekend, adding to the excitement of this celebrated event.As McLaren’s CEO takes the wheel of this historic car, Formula 1 enthusiasts can look forward to a moment of nostalgia and sheer racing brilliance at the 2025 British Grand Prix.Also Read: Mick Schumacher is on the verge of F1 comeback in 2026 after being shortlisted by a surprise new team","McLaren CEO Zak Brown is set to take the iconic 1987 Williams FW11B Formula 1 car for a spin around the Silverstone Circuit.

What’s the tile game Meghan Markle played on Netflix? A beginner’s guide to mahjong,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/whats-the-tile-game-meghan-markle-played-on-netflix-a-beginners-guide-to-mahjong/articleshow/120736644.cms,"Meghan Markle played the game of Mahjong in her Netflix series

From the Qing dynasty to pop culture

How is mahjong played?

Connor Wan, a 29-year-old British-Chinese artist, learned mahjong while visiting family in Hong Kong. He enjoyed it so much that he started the Four Winds Mahjong Club in London, and later brought it to Toronto after moving there in 2024. “Moving countries is hard, especially when you don’t know anyone,” he said. The club became popular quickly, not as a place for gambling, but for making friends and celebrating Asian culture. Nicole Wong, a writer and audio producer from California, started playing mahjong as a teenager with her grandparents. She later began The Mahjong Project in 2019 to share the game’s cultural stories and organise pop-up game nights. This year, she published a book called Mahjong: House Rules from Across the Asian Diaspora. Nicole says the sound of the tiles is especially powerful. “Mahjong is more than just fun,” she says. “It has a deep history and brings back strong memories.” In Toronto, Robyn Feldberg has taught over 250 people how to play mahjong through her courses. She donates all the money—about $50,000 so far—to charities like Save A Child’s Heart. She says the game is especially popular with young mothers who want a fun way to relax and connect with others. “They tell me, ‘We want something that’s just for us,’” she said.

A centuries-old Chinese game called mahjong is having a modern revival across continents, from luxury cruise ships and trendy hotel lounges to Meghan Markle’s Netflix series.In the sixth episode of her docuseries With Love, the Duchess of Sussex invites friends for a cosy game night – playing mahjong, reports the Globe and Mail.The four-person tile-based game, traditionally associated with Chinese culture, is now catching on with new generations across the globe. “The game itself is really so fun,” says Markle. “But what was so great was the idea of learning something new with your friends, together... the mahjong becomes the background of the expansion of friendship. It’s the feeling of community.”Mahjong dates back to the mid-1800s during the Qing Dynasty in China. Traditionally played with 144 tiles, the game blends skill, strategy and a touch of luck. Players pick and discard tiles to form winning hands, much like the card game rummy.The game’s expansion across the world has now erupted into a full-blown trend. The World Mahjong Championship was recently held in Mississauga, Ontario – the first time it’s been hosted in North America. Hotels such as the Ace Hotel New York and Thompson Hotel Dallas regularly hold mahjong-themed nights.Fans with money to spare are buying fancy mahjong sets from Hermès, Louis Vuitton, and Ralph Lauren. Some are even splashing out on luxury tables that shuffle the tiles automatically – costing over $4,500.Even cruise ships have joined the trend, offering mahjong tournaments and special rooms just for playing the game.Mahjong is played with 144 tiles. Players begin by shuffling the tiles face down. Everyone rolls dice and the highest roller becomes the dealer. Each player picks 36 tiles and builds a wall—two rows of 18 tiles. The walls are pushed forward, creating a space in the middle for discards. Each player then draws 13 tiles (the dealer starts with 14), and the game begins.Players take turns drawing one tile and discarding one, always keeping 13 tiles in hand. You can draw a new tile or pick up someone’s discarded one. If a discarded tile helps complete a set (called a meld), you can grab it, announce the set, and show the tiles. To win, a player must have four melds (like three or four matching tiles or a sequence of three in a suit) and one pair (two matching tiles)—making 14 tiles total.There are five types of tiles: Bamboo, Characters, Dots (these are the three main suits), and special tiles called Honors (Dragons and Winds) and Bonus (Flowers and Seasons). Each suit goes from 1 to 9. Honors and Bonus tiles add extra excitement but aren't needed to win. Mahjong mixes strategy and memory with a bit of luck—and it’s all about building the right sets before your opponents do.For many mahjong fans, it’s not just a game but a deeply social experience.","Mahjong dates back to the mid-1800s during the Qing Dynasty in China.

LONDON: Over 30 years after Britain's elite Magic Circle expelled a woman for posing as a man to gain admittance, the formerly male-only society is to welcome her back as a full member.The London-based international magic organisation ejected Sophie Lloyd after she masqueraded as a male in 1991 to win membership.But after her story came to light last year, the society's first female chair Laura London launched a search to track down Lloyd and apologise.She was eventually located living abroad and will later on Thursday be presented with a membership certificate at a special ceremony at the organisation's London headquarters.""It is so exciting after all these months tracking Sophie... I can't tell you how happy we are as a society to welcome her back into the fold,"" London told BBC radio.Lloyd posed as Raymond Lloyd for 18 months before unmasking herself as a woman.But members, who voted to admit women in September 1991, were so angered by her ""deliberate deception"" that they went ahead with her expulsion.The deception was in fact a two-person act involving the late magician Jenny Winstanley, who recruited Lloyd to help her prove that women magicians were just as good as men.""I did a 20-minute show in front of 200 people, three examiners, and spoke to the examiner for an hour-and-three-quarters afterwards,"" Lloyd said, recalling how she managed to pull the wool over everyone's eyes.After the Magic Circle changed its stance on allowing women in, Winstanley, who died in 2004, phoned the society to explain.""Two days later we got a letter to say Raymond's been expelled,"" said Lloyd.""We couldn't get our heads round it. We just thought, 'come on it's funny, it's amusing' but they didn't think so and Jenny was completely snubbed, unfortunately.""After the expulsion, Lloyd continued to perform magic for 11 years in an anti-bullying variety show before eventually moving overseas.She said the Magic Circle had changed out of all recognition in the 30 years since she was thrown out, adding: ""This is for Jenny really, Jenny would have loved it.""London said Thursday's ceremony would also be a chance to recognise Winstanley both for her contribution to magic and her audacious trick at the Magic Circle's expense.""I just think she's a wonderful woman and I know she'd have loved to be here and I just wish more than anything I could have met her myself,"" she said.The Magic Circle was founded in 1905 by around 20 magicians at a restaurant in London's Chinatown district.Members must vow never to give away the secrets of magic.Although women have now been admitted to the Magic Circle for over 30 years, they still make up only around five percent of the society's 1,700 membership.The body says, however, that increasing numbers are now coming through in the 10-18-year-old age group.","Sophie Lloyd was expelled from the Magic Circle after posing as a man to gain admittance.

NEW DELHI: The IPL match between Punjab Kings and Delhi Capitals on Thursday was abandoned midway due to air raid alerts in the neighbouring cities of Jammu and Pathankot, casting a cloud of uncertainty over the remainder of the tournament.

As of now the match has been called off and the stadium has been evacuated. We will take a call on the tournament's future depending on the situation tomorrow.

As panic grips Indian Premier League ( IPL ) teams, the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) could well be left with no option but to halt the ongoing edition of the tournament.

None of the existing IPL venues have been under any kind of threat as of now. However, the BCCI may have to keep the larger sentiment of the nation in mind and halting the tournament, even if temporarily.It is further understood that overseas players of most franchises are in a state of panic and they would need some serious assurances from the BCCI and the Indian government to stay back in the country for the tournament. As of now, there is no clarity over the game in Lucknow tomorrow (between Lucknow Super Giants and Royal Challengers Bengaluru).The Indian cricket board will proceed further based on the directive they get from the Indian government, and all teams will act as per the guidelines they receive.

My best wishes to him. He had a good career, he will play One Day for India and IPL...

Chennai Super Kings, long out of the playoff race, played spoilsport at Eden Gardens with a spirited victory over Kolkata Knight Riders in Match 57 of IPL 2025. The win, only their third of the season, has dented KKR’s campaign at a crucial juncture.KKR, who were pushing for a late surge into the top four, remain stuck on 11 points from 12 games. Their Net Run Rate (NRR) has also taken a hit, pushing them further behind Delhi Capitals in the mid-table battle. With just two games left, KKR now not only need to win both but also hope for favourable results from other matches to stay alive in the playoff race.CSK, meanwhile, are still at the bottom of the table. They now have 3 wins from 12 games, While still out of contention, the win was a morale-booster for a side enduring its toughest IPL season in recent memory.Gujarat Titans sit atop with 16 points from 12 matches and a robust NRR of +0.753. Their eighth win puts them within touching distance of a playoff berth.Royal Challengers Bengaluru are second with 16 points as well, having played one game fewer. Their NRR of +0.482 gives them a good cushion. Punjab Kings remain in third with 15 points from 11 games and a healthy NRR of +0.376. They’re hot on the heels of the top two.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? Mumbai Indians are fourth with 14 points and the best NRR in the league at +1.156. They remain well-placed, but cannot afford slip-ups. Delhi Capitals are fifth with 13 points in 11 matches, staying in contention with a NRR of +0.362.KKR are now sixth, still on 11 points from 12 games, with NRR of +0.193 and their path to qualification looks increasingly steep. LSG follow with 10 points and a NRR of -0.469, meaning their playoff push hinges on big wins and other results.Sunrisers Hyderabad (3 wins, NRR -1.192) and Rajasthan Royals (3 wins, NRR -1.173) are officially out.As the league enters its final week, the playoff race remains intense — and today’s result shows that even the bottom teams can still turn the tide on those chasing the top four.","Chennai Super Kings beat Kolkata Knight Riders in Match 57 of IPL 2025.

Mumbai: In developments that have cast a dark shadow over the remainder of IPL 2025 , the match between Punjab Kings and Delhi Capitals at the Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium in Dharamshala was called off on Thursday night due to attacks from Pakistan in various parts of India.The match was halted after 10.1 overs, with Punjab Kings cruising at 122/1, when the floodlights were suddenly turned off.All players, IPL officials, and support staff were immediately evacuated from the stadium.Sources said the BCCI fears the development could cause panic in IPL camps, and foreign players could be uncomfortable about staying back. At the time of going to print, no call had been taken on Friday’s game in Lucknow.“It is on as of now but obviously it is an evolving situation,” IPL chairman Arun Dhumal told PTI, adding: “A decision will be taken keeping the best interest of all stakeholders in mind. We haven’t received any directive from the government. We are reviewing the situation right now.”BCCI secretary Devajit Saikia told TOI , “We have abandoned Thursday’s match considering the security of the players, officials and spectators. There’s no direct threat in Dharamshala but in view of developments in nearby areas, we’ve taken this precautionary call.”Asked about the fate of the remaining matches and whether the IPL would continue, Saikia added, “We will assess tonight’s developments and take a decision tomorrow.”There were reports suggesting that players, support staff, team owners (including Punjab Kings co-owner Preity Zinta, who was present at the venue), and fans might be evacuated by train. “I can’t disclose logistical details. There are multiple travel options from Dharamshala.

LUCKNOW: As a struggling LSG prepare to take on RCB here on Friday, they know they only have an outside chance of making it to the playoffs. Lucknow’s remaining three matches are vital, two at home and one away.Even if they win all three, they will need a lot of other results to go their way. Lucknow’s poor NRR of -0.469 could also cost them even if everything else magically goes in their favour.If Rishabh Pant’s men can simply stay alive after Friday’s tie, it will be a big boost.RCB, on the other hand, are red hot and will look to secure a playoff spot. They have enjoyed one of their most consistent seasons. Importantly, Virat Kohli has continued to pile on the runs, providing the platform for the likes of Romario Shepherd to explode at the end. One big reason for RCB’s success has been the spin duo of Krunal Pandya and Suyash Sharma.LSG know they will need to come up with something special. Their overseas top order has looked out of sorts and Pant has continued to struggle. Only Ayush Badoni and Abdul Samad have held their own. Luckily for them, the match will be played on a black soil surface, on which LSG have won two matches.","LSG take on RCB in their final match of the season on Friday.
