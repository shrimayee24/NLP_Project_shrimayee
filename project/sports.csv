Elderly deaths, distress reported amid SIR hearings across Bengal

KOLKATA: An 82-year-old jumped on the railway tracks hours before his scheduled appearance at a hearing for the special intensive revision of electoral rolls at Para in Bengal's Purulia Monday. A septuagenarian from Howrah and another from Kalyani died after receiving SIR hearing notices. Family members of both blamed SIR stress for the deaths.As SIR hearings entered the third day, reports poured in of anxiety gripping ""unmapped"" voters being asked to appear before EC officials.A 96-year-old man in Cooch Behar, a 90-year-old woman in Katwa and a pregnant homemaker from Taki were among thousands who waited in queues for hearings. EC clarified that, on request, BLOs would visit homes of voters aged 85 and above, and those with disabilities and ailments.TNNDurjan Majhi, 82, jumped onto the railway tracks and was run over by a train at 8.30am, around 5 hours before he was to appear in an SIR hearing at the Para BDO office. His only son Kanai, who works as a day labourer, said, ""My father had submitted the SIR enumeration form but his name was not on the draft voters' list.His name was on the 2002 voters' list, though. We don't understand why he was called to a hearing. He had been anxious since getting the hearing notice on Dec 25. ""Jamat Ali, 75, passed away at his home in Howrah's Amta Sunday night, hours after receiving a hearing notice. Howrah DM P Deepap Priya said, ""He was already unwell. His kin claimed he was anxious about the hearing. An inquiry is underway.""In Kalyani, Jaharlal Mahato (72) died of cardiac arrest on Monday, 48 hours after he attended an SIR hearing. Son Tamaghlal said, ""He had been distressed since the hearing. His name was on the 2002 list, yet he was called to a hearing.At the Dinhata Block 1 BDO office in Cooch Behar, 96-year-old Nikhil Chandra Sarkar had turned up with his wife and son to appear before EC officials. He could barely walk because of his age and physical ailments. ""I am the only one in my family to get the SIR notice. My name was not on the 2002 list. I gave them whatever documents I had,"" Sarkar said, visibly frustrated.At Katwa I BDO office, one of the people in the queue was a 90-year-old bedridden woman, Muktibala Paramanik, whose house is 4km from the hearing venue. Grandson Paritosh Paramanik said, ""This is just harassment. They asked her to sign some documents and let her go.""East Burdwan DM Ayesha Rani said, ""We did not get any written instruction that hearings for elderly people should be conducted at home. Even so, I instructed that elderly and infirm people should not be called.""A woman from Taki, who is eight months pregnant, fell ill while waiting in a long queue at Basirhat Block II BDO office. Supriya Mondal got a hearing notice as her name did not feature on the 2002 list. Her mother, Khukurani Das, said, ""After waiting for a long time in the crowd, my daughter suddenly felt dizzy and collapsed.

A young woman had arrived at a hearing venue in central Kolkata with her three-month-old child. ""We came here around 1pm.

Son's wedding invite lands man in cops net 13 yrs after fleeing custody,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sons-wedding-invite-lands-man-in-cops-net-13-yrs-after-fleeing-custody/articleshow/126240891.cms,"Lucknow, Dec 19 (IANS) A cleric in Uttar Pradesh’s Bahraich district was arrested by the police for sexually assaulting a madrassa student and threatening her with life if she approached cops or disclosed it to anyone.

Lucknow: A family phone call regarding his son's wedding led to the arrest of history-sheeter Sandeep Mishra, who had been on the run after escaping from police custody in 13 years ago. Police had announced a cash reward of Rs 1 lakh on his head.He was arrested in Banda after an encounter.Mishra (45) was being taken to a court from Banda jail with 12 others on Aug 8, 2012, when he threw chilli powder on the escorting cops and opened fire from a rifle snatched from one of them. In the chaos, all 13 accused fled.While all 12 co-accused were arrested by 2015, Mishra remained absconding.On the radar of the special team that was tasked with tracking down the criminals on the run, Mishra, who had been living as Pappu Tiwari in Pune, got arrested after police intercepted a phone call inviting relatives from UP to Pune for his son's wedding.""We used multiple methods to keep an eye on elusive criminals, including tip-offs from informers, surveillance, and decoys. For six months, we had been tracking Mishra,"" said SP Palash Bansal.The surveillance and tip-offs revealed that Mishra had changed his identity to evade arrest. His wife Shyama had also changed her name to Pooja Tiwari, said Bansal.""The accused managed to stay off police radar by frequently changing locations and limiting contact with relatives.The accused worked in factories and made no contact with the family, and even avoided travelling to Banda in these years,"" said an official.The breakthrough came when cops intercepted a call made by his wife to her parents. It raised red flags during surveillance, prompting cops to verify the family details and movements. The cops checked that the names of the parents matched those of the in-laws of the elusive Mishra.After months of quiet tracking and ground verification, police zeroed in on the suspect's activity as he was to come to attend his son's wedding in Banda, said a source.","Sandeep Mishra had been on the run after escaping from police custody in 13 years ago.

Spiritual leader Sadhguru on Monday said that the Siliguri corridor was an anomaly created by partition, which should have been corrected in 1971.He further said that today, as the nation faces a threat to its sovereignty, India must develop the chicken into an elephant, referring to extremist policies by the Bangladeshi regime.He said, ""Siliguri Corridor is a 78-year-old anomaly created by Bharat's partition, which should have been corrected in 1971. Now that there is an open threat to the nation's sovereignty, it is time to nourish the chicken and allow it to evolve into an elephant.""The spiritual leader was responding to recent statements by some Bangladeshi leaders invoking the ""Chicken's Neck"" or Siliguri Corridor and threatening India of cutting it off.Earlier, former Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina described such rhetoric as ""dangerous and irresponsible,"" saying no serious leader would threaten a neighbour on whom Bangladesh depends for trade, transit and stability.She said such voices ""do not represent the Bangladeshi people,"" and expressed confidence that ""once democracy is restored and responsible governance returns, such reckless talk will end.""Commenting on indications of growing Pakistan-Bangladesh engagement, Sheikh Hasina said Bangladesh believes in ""friendship to all, malice toward none,"" but criticised what she described as Yunus' ""headlong embrace"" of Islamabad.As per the Assam Accord and subsequent provisions under the Citizenship Act, individuals who entered Assam from Bangladesh before March 24, 1971, and have been residing in the state, are deemed Indian citizens. Those who migrated after the cut-off date are considered illegal immigrants under Indian law.Meanwhile on December 27, amid the ongoing protests against the atrocities faced by the minorities in Bangladesh, the BJP workers on Friday held a torchlight rally in Siliguri.BJP leader Anita Mahato, who also participated in the rally, stated that until Hindus unite, such violent incidents will continue to occur.""We (BJP workers) held a torchlight rally against the way sanatani Hindus are being tortured in Bangladesh in Siliguri.

Dwight Howard calls on President Donald Trump to enforce mandatory measure for all U.S. citizens



Dwight Howard responds to talk of NBA comeback



Dwight Howard has made a request to President Donald Trump that sparked a huge conversation online. The newly inducted Hall of Famer used his platform to float a nationwide policy idea aimed at civic service, just a day after his response that reignited speculation about a possible NBA comeback.The former No. 1 overall pick has largely stayed away from political discourse since stepping out of the NBA spotlight. Hours later, Howard was back in familiar territory, responding to a fan who suggested one more run on an NBA floor. Howard has been active on social media, especially on X. His posts often spark conversation, be it anything regarding basketball, his personal opinion, or his personal life.Dwight Howard took to X on Sunday night with an idea he said came to him organically. He called on President Donald Trump to mandate one year of service for every person born in the United States. In his view, the policy could strengthen discipline and structure across society.He wrote: “Random. I honestly feel like the president should make one year of service mandatory for everyone born in America. A lot of other countries do it. And I think it would help with discipline and structure. I’m curious what y’all think would this help America or nah.”Howard later clarified that he believes military service would be the most effective option. “I think military service would be better. Learn how to defend yourself. Shoot and handle guns properly. The bond and respect for each other would go up.”The post triggered mixed responses, including questions about Howard’s own experience. When pressed, he shared an image of himself in military gear, later explaining it was from a reality show. He responded to criticism by saying, “We got set on fire, tear-gassed, had to do every single thing that people in special forces do only supporting my case that people should get the necessary training.”Just prior to his post for Trump on X going viral, Howard also addressed basketball chatter that has followed him since his final NBA season in 2022. A fan suggested teams sign him to a short-term deal so he could move up the NBA’s all-time rebounding list. Howard replied with a simple message: “That would be fire.”Howard finished his NBA career with 14,627 rebounds, placing him tenth all-time. He trails Kevin Garnett by 35 boards. His career includes eight All-Star selections, three Defensive Player of the Year awards, an NBA title with the Lakers, and a Hall of Fame induction in 2025.Howard has played overseas and in the Big3 since leaving the league.Also Read: Inside Vanessa Bryant’s daughter Natalia Bryant’s glamorous life: Career, education, and more","Dwight Howard called on President Donald Trump to mandate one year of service for every person born in the United States.

Joe Kelly steps away from baseball, says he’s done playing but won’t call it retirement

Joe Kelly has reportedly decided to step away from professional baseball. The veteran pitcher shared that he is done playing, but stopped short of calling it a formal retirement. His words were brief and honest, reflecting a decision that came without drama or ceremony.Beyond the stats and seasons, Kelly will always remembered by fans for that one face he made to the Houston Astros hitter, a memory that will remain vividly, even after his playing days.The three-time World Series champion said, “Retiring is like, something my grandmother did. I’m sorry all you people out there watching this that work a real job. You guys deserve to retire. It’s used for people who served in the military, it’s used for people who worked until 65.”The 37 year old veteran steps aside the mound with 839 career innings, a 3.98 ERA, three World Series rings. Kelly arrived in Los Angeles after helping the Boston Red Sox win against Dodgers. He is a third round pick by the Cardinals in 2009 and was successful in his three Fall Classic appearances posting 2.03 ERA with 19 strikeouts over 13.1 innings.He won rings with the Red Sox in 2018 and twice with the Dodgers in 2020 and 2024.Joe Kelly is married to Ashley Nicole Kelly whom he met at the University of California, Riverside (UCR). They tied the knot in November 2013. The couple has three sons and a daughter.Over the years Kelly has built a reputation as a competitor who thrived in high pressure moments. Teammates often spoke about his confidence, the personality that he carries on-field. Kelly’s career also reflected adaptability as he adjusted to different teams, and found ways to contribute even as his role evolved later in his career.Off the field, Kelly maintained a relatively private life, balancing baseball and responsibility with the family. The balance appeared to shape his decision to step away quietly, without framing it as a dramatic farewell.With his playing days are now behind him, his career will be remembered for its intensity, big moments, and a personality that stood out on the mound.","Joe Kelly says he's done playing but won't call it retirement.

Skylar Diggins custody battle draws response from Daniel Smith



Skylar Diggins stepped into the public eye this week, and that had nothing to do with basketball. The Seattle Storm guard recently shared a personal message that revealed the strain of divorce and an ongoing custody fight while raising two children.The seven-time All-Star did not reference court filings or timelines. Instead, she focused on daily reality. Her work and practice while being a parent with enormous responsibility. Her statement shared that she has been doing everything by herself and she is proud of herschel;f for that.Skylar Diggins used Instagram to reflect on what she described as more than a year of managing life largely on her own. She wrote, “Been doing everything BY MYSLF (sic) for over a year now. Just me and my babies (and the help of my mom/dad.) THAT'S IT!”She followed with another message, “Working, paying the bills, being a present mother and battling through a lot of unknowns... God's strongest soldier 2025.”Diggins and Daniel Smith married in April 2017 after meeting at Notre Dame. They share two children. Reports earlier this year confirmed that Diggins filed for divorce in March, with the separation dating back to November 2024. She had previously signaled the change publicly when she asked reporters to refer to her without Smith’s last name during a press conference.Despite the personal turmoil, Diggins posted strong numbers for Seattle this season, averaging 15.5 points and six assists per game.Smith also addressed the situation through social media, offering his own perspective on the custody dispute. He wrote that he has “been litigating, ordering and asking for custody since April 2025. Separation from my babies has never been okay with me.”He added, “Luckily, I’m a big guy and I’ll be able to hold my babies for a long time.”The legal process remains ongoing, and neither side has indicated a timeline for resolution. Diggins has kept her focus on her children and her career, leaning on family support while maintaining a full professional schedule.The response to her post has been widespread. While the court proceedings continue privately, Diggins’ post revealed her personal struggles.Also Read: Ex-Lakers star Dwight Howard urges President Donald Trump to implement mandatory policy nationwide","Seattle Storm guard Skylar Diggins shared a personal message on social media.

Singer D4vd is expected to face murder charges in the mysterious death of 14-year-old Celeste Rivas who was missing for a year before remains of her body were found in the singer's discarded car. Celeste and D4vd were apparently in a relationship and the investigation into the case now points all possibilities towards 20-year-old D4vd.Celeste Rivas was reported missing on April 5, 2024. She was 13 years old at that time. This was not the first time she ran from her home. For a year, she remained missing until September 8, 2025 when decomposed remains of Celeste were found in a car which belonged to D4vd.D4vd's Tesla was reportedly abandoned in August and was ticketed for violating parking rules on September 3. The Tesla was impounded by the authorities on September 5 and after that foul smell coming from the car led cops to open the front trunk of the car, where Celeste's remains were found.The exact date of Celeste's death could not be ascertained as the body was beyond examination. The cause of death also remained unknown.D4vd canceled all his tours as he was considered a person of interest in the case. A grand jury began hearing evidence in the case in November and now it is likely that the grand jury will indict D4vd on murder charges. D4vd’s manager, Robert Morgenroth, testified for several days.Details of the hearing are not known but sources claimed that D4vd took the help of multiple people to dismember the body.","Celeste Rivas was reported missing on April 5, 2024.

Mike Tomlin’s future in Pittsburgh grows uncertain as Steelers’ late-season collapse tests fan loyalty,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/mike-tomlins-future-in-pittsburgh-grows-uncertain-as-steelers-late-season-collapse-tests-fan-loyalty/articleshow/126233958.cms,"Mike Tomlin (via Getty Images)

A proud standard collides with modern NFL pressure and unmet expectations

Mike Tomlin and the Pittsburgh Steelers are now feeling the wrath of fans following a frustrating 13-6 loss to the Cleveland. For the first time in years, a large portion of the fan base is openly questioning whether Mike Tomlin is still the right man to lead the franchise. What once felt like another steady season has unraveled into a mediocre and disappointing outing for the team.With playoff hopes hanging by a thread and sky-high expectations, fans feel the Steelers failed when it mattered the most, and a change in leadership is the need of the hour. It doesn't help that the Steelers lost crucial matches despite consistent performances from their star players, leading the blame to fall on Tomlin.This frustration did not come from the recent disappointing Sunday, as their losing stats have been building up as the season went. The breaking point for many came during the lopsided 26-7 home loss to the Buffalo Bills, when chants calling for Tomlin’s dismissal echoed through Acrisure Stadium. It was a rather unexpected yet understandable moment, echoing the downgrading performance on the field.Fans point to the dynamic roster as proof that more should have been achieved than With star power like Aaron Rodgers and defensive leader T.J. Watt, expectations were high. A strong 4-1 start suggested momentum, yet the Steelers stumbled down the stretch and now sit at 9-7 entering the final week. It is still notable that Pittsburgh has not won a playoff game in eight yearsTomlin, for his part, has not avoided accountability. After hearing the boos, he addressed the situation directly.He said, “Man, I share their frustration tonight. We didn't do enough, and that's just the reality of it. I never want people to apologize for caring.” Despite the honesty, calls for change in leadership are now in full effect on social media.Tomlin is the NFL’s longest-tenured head coach and has never posted a losing season in 19 years. It is indeed a slump for the head coach, who once demanded a lot of respect and admiration from fans. As Pittsburgh prepares for its next game against Baltimore, the results will determine whether fans double down on their current demand.Also read: ‘I could see Tomlin taking a breather’: Could Mike Tomlin really walk away from Steelers and take a year off?",Pittsburgh Steelers lost 13-6 to the Cleveland Browns on Sunday.

What the New York Mets Gain - and Risk

The New York Mets are adjusting quickly after moving on from a player who had been part of the franchise for nearly a decade. With Brandon Nimmo now in Texas, the Mets are looking for a short-term outfield solution that keeps spending under control while maintaining roster stability.That search has led them to Max Kepler. The veteran outfielder is viewed as a practical replacement rather than a headline move. A reported one-year deal worth $7.6 million would give the Mets defensive reliability and left-handed power without limiting future flexibility.The New York Mets’ plans shifted after a rare one-for-one trade with the Texas Rangers sent Nimmo to Texas in exchange for second baseman Marcus Semien. Nimmo agreed to waive his full no-trade clause to complete the deal, ending his eight-year, $162 million run in New York.On the field, Nimmo remained productive in 2025. He played 143 games and finished with a .261 average, 23 home runs, and 82 RBIs.Still, the Mets chose to prioritize infield stability and payroll balance. Semien now fills second base, but the move left a clear opening in left field.Max Kepler became a free agent after a one-year, $10 million season with Philadelphia that was slowed by knee issues. His overall numbers dipped, but the Mets see value in his defense and underlying power metrics. In 2025, he ranked among the league’s best outfield arms and remains well-suited for corner work.A short-term deal also fits the Mets’ longer view. Top prospect Carson Benge is expected to push for a larger role soon, and Kepler would serve as a bridge rather than a blocker. The savings compared to Nimmo’s contract also leave room to pursue pitching upgrades.Max Kepler gives the Mets steady corner defense, a strong throwing arm, and power against right-handed pitching at a lower cost. His projected salary is far below Nimmo’s annual average, which helps keep the luxury tax in check.The concern is durability and age. Kepler is entering his mid-30s and coming off a down year. He also does not solve the center-field question long term, which leaves the Mets relying on internal options.Also read: MLB trade rumors: Detroit Tigers predicted to chase $6.25 million Minnesota Twins star to address center field and bolster squad Even with those risks, the move fits the moment.

Oliver Bearman’s 2025 contract: Hitting the F1 money lap

Beyond the chequered flag: Wealth and personal life

Oliver Bearman’s year 2025, however, was the year he took a giant leap in his young racing career, moving from being a junior sensation to becoming the first full-timer at the tender age of 19 with the Haas F1 Team in Formula 1 racing. Off the podium, there’s a new love story brewing in the F1 paddock between not-so-new star Oliver Bearman and Alicia Torriani, who has been spotted several times with the young racing sensation at his races and at the paddock, which helps add another dimension to his story because, apart from the racing action in F1, the purse strings involved in an F1 racing star’s services have their own story to tell.Oliver Bearman's first big contract in Haas F1 Team in 2025 is one of the biggest turning points in his personal as well as professional life. After performing well as a member of the reserve team and earning points in his first races, Oliver signed a multi-year contract. His base salary for the year 2025 has been estimated to be around $1 million, which may be relatively modest in the context of Formula 1 but represents a substantial improvement over what one might find in lower-tier series. It may be noted here that the given figure is much lower than what stars take home but represents Haas’ faith in Daniel Ricciardo’s potential and not stardom per se.Also, performance bonuses could increase his earnings further. Although figures are not revealed, rookies have incentives related to scoring, racing, and team scoring. Therefore, better performance could increase his earnings further.As of 2025, Oliver Bearman has an estimated net worth of approximately $1.3 million, attributed primarily to his income, earnings from his early racing career, and budding success in F1 racing circles. Alicia Torriani, on the other hand, maintains a much more discreet life, and although sparingly observed accompanying Bearman to grands prix events and sharing their experiences, her estimated personal net worth remains unknown.Taken together, their combined wealth offers a glimpse into what it means to be a young driver starting his engine and ready to hit the roads of bigger prospects down the line.Although Bearman’s income now may be small compared to that of a seasoned professional, his inclusion in F1’s rich streets puts him in line for higher incomes down the line as a mature professional in his own right. All in all, he has a bright future because in a world filled with enthusiasts and friends like Torriani backing him up, anything is possible.Also Read: Isack Hadjar net worth in 2025: Salary breakdown, Racing Bulls career, bonuses, and contract details","Oliver Bearman's first big contract in Haas F1 Team in 2025 is one of the biggest turning points in his personal as well as professional life.

From MCG to T20 World Cup snub: How Indian cricket let Shubman Gill down

India squad for T20 World Cup 2026

Suryakumar Yadav (capt), Axar Patel (vice-capt) Abhishek Sharma, Sanju Samson, Tilak Varma, Hardik Pandya, Shivam Dube, Rinku Singh, Jasprit Bumrah, Harshit Rana, Arshdeep Singh, Kuldeep Yadav, Varun Chakaravarthy, Washington Sundar, Ishan Kishan.

NEW DELHI: Indian selectors sent out a blunt message ahead of the 2026 T20 World Cup in February, dropping Test and ODI captain Shubman Gill from the squad after a prolonged slump in the shortest format. The call, announced on December 20, underlined India's uncompromising approach as they look to defend the title at home.Gill, 26, has scored only 291 runs in his last 15 T20 matches at an average of 24.25, numbers that ultimately worked against him despite his stature across formats. Chief selector Ajit Agarkar was direct in his assessment. “Shubman Gill is short of runs at the moment,” he said while addressing the media in Mumbai.Former India spinner Harbhajan Singh, however, was quick to put the omission in perspective, stressing that it should not be read as a demotion. “No, it's not a signal to Gill, you know, that he wasn't really taking his place as granted. But the competition is so much and they've got, you know, too many players at the present scenario who can fill the slot and can do well for the team,” Harbhajan said.He added that Gill's journey with the national side was far from over.“And this is not the end of the road for Gill. He's a great, great player with beautiful technique. I think he will make a brilliant comeback. And not to forget, he's still a Test captain for India.”In contrast to Gill's exclusion, Suryakumar Yadav was retained as captain despite his own struggles with form. A T20 specialist, Suryakumar has managed just 244 runs in his last 22 innings without a single fifty. Agarkar backed him strongly, saying, “We have full faith in our captain to deliver during the World Cup.” Suryakumar himself admitted his “rough patch” had lasted too long but sounded confident about turning it around.Harbhajan echoed the selectors' logic, pointing to team balance over individual profiles. “I was listening to Ajit [Agarkar] and Surya [Suryakumar Yadav], they were looking at the combination of the team, which will be best in the format. So I think giving that, those conditions and combinations, that respect. They chose this team. So Gill is a class player, there's no doubt about it, and he'll make a great comeback. ”Axar Patel was named vice-captain, while Ishan Kishan earned a recall on the back of strong domestic form. India will fine-tune preparations during a five-match home T20I series against New Zealand from January 21, their final assignment before the World Cup, which will be jointly hosted by India and Sri Lanka and feature 20 teams.","Gill, 26, has scored only 291 runs in his last 15 T20 matches at an average of 24.25.

Harmanpreet Kaur gets emotional after leading India to World Cup glory

Indian women cricket team's vice-captain Smriti Mandhana said focusing on the World Cup win will not help the team prepare for the next one and added that the side still has areas to work on ahead of the T20 World Cup scheduled next year.Mandhana returned to form in the fourth T20I against Sri Lanka in Trivandrum on Sunday after low scores in the first three matches. She scored 80 off 48 balls and also crossed 10,000 international runs during the knock. She became the fastest female cricketer to reach the mark and only the fourth overall after Charlotte Edwards, Mithali Raj and Suzie Bates.""In cricket, you have to start from zero. The scoreboard is always zero for zero. It's never what you've done in the last match or previous series as well. Internal expectations for me in all three formats are very different. Of course, T20 is slightly in a way where you can't be extremely hard on yourself after getting out because you're playing at a pace where there are days when it'll come off. There are days when it won't. """"I'm really tough on myself with one-day cricket and test cricket because, of course, you have a lot of time.If you get out there, it feels like a sin for me. But there are days when you win the match for the country, but there are days when you won't be able to get runs. But you have to take both things at your stride because you can't overthink. It's just quick turnover,"" Mandhana said in a video shared by the BCCI.She said the team remains a work in progress and that thinking too much about the recent ODI World Cup win will not help future results.""Like, if I had thought a lot about the first three matches, we only had one day before this one. So it's about just prepping your mind around how you want to go about your cricket. The One Day World Cup was the biggest thing for women's cricket. And we did take off that one. So it's a big, big win. But again, you know, you can't be thinking about only successes.""""We've had times when we could have won matches, but we couldn't this year. And again, this team being this young, we are always a work in progress. There's going to be a World Cup, but it's a work in progress. If you keep thinking about the World Cup, the next one won't come. If I had to review it more critically, I would give it 7 out of 10. We have many areas to improve as a team,"" she said.Mandhana also thanked the fans for their support during the ODI World Cup and said the team hopes to keep earning their backing.""We keep talking about it in terms of where we want to see ourselves fitness-wise, feeling-wise, and running-wise. And then, of course, power hitting now with T20s. So yeah, I mean, all in those things, execution of bowling plans. I had spoken about bowlers. But I feel as an Indian team, all the fans who've supported us throughout the year, especially the One Day World Cup and post that kind of support we've got, I feel, I mean, it's just been a fantastic year for women's cricket. And I hope we just keep making them proud, and I hope they keep turning up and support us,” she said.","Indian women cricket team's vice-captain Smriti Mandhana said focusing on the World Cup win will not help the team prepare for the next one.

How Bryce Dunlap’s liver donation became the centerpiece of Cleveland’s final home game

Bernie Kosar’s message and why this tribute went beyond a typical game-day honor

The Cleveland Browns’ Week 17 matchup against the Pittsburgh Steelers came with a pregame moment that pulled attention away from the standings and straight to the heart of Huntington Bank Field.Kimberly Dunlap Kane, the mother of Bryce Dunlap, served as the Browns’ Dawg Pound Captain for the final home game of the 2025 season. The tribute carried real weight. Bryce Dunlap was the organ donor who saved the life of Browns legend Bernie Kosar, and his family was honored in front of a full stadium before kickoff.Before Kane walked onto the field, the Browns played a recorded message from Kosar on the stadium video board. The timing mattered. This was Cleveland’s last home game of the season and the team chose to center it on gratitude, not football.“I can’t even begin to share how appreciative I am for the gift I received from Bryce Dunlap,” Kosar said. “Everyone please get on your feet, and make some noise and show some support for my hero, Bryce.”Kane then stepped onto the field and smashed a black-and-yellow, Steelers-themed guitar to start the game.It was symbolic, but not theatrical. The moment was about Bryce, not the rivalry.Bryce Dunlap passed away on Nov. 16 at age 21 after complications from an anoxic brain injury. His family selected Kosar as the recipient of Bryce’s liver through a directed donation. Kosar received the transplant on Nov. 17 and was discharged from the hospital on Nov. 24.According to the Browns, the organization and Kosar have remained in contact with the Dunlap family since the transplant. The team confirmed Kane’s Dawg Pound Captain role ahead of kickoff and shared the moment publicly, crediting Bryce directly for Kosar’s recovery.Kosar was not in attendance for the game, but he shared his support again through social media. His message stayed consistent. This was about honoring Bryce and his family, not celebrating his own recovery.“Hi, Browns fans,” Kosar said in the video posted by the team. “I can’t even begin to share how appreciative I am for the gift I received from Bryce Dunlap. Everyone, please get on your feet and make some noise to show your support for my hero, Bryce. And here to represent Bryce is his mother, Kimberly Dunlap Kane, who’ll be today’s Dawg Pound Captain. You matter, Go Browns.”Kosar has dealt with cirrhosis of the liver and Parkinson’s disease since 2024, making the transplant necessary. The donation was processed through LifeBanc, a nonprofit organ procurement organization. Kosar shared a recovery update after surgery and has remained publicly thankful to the Dunlap family.The Browns’ decision to center their final home pregame ceremony around Kane reframed the day. It was not about playoff implications or season results. It was about acknowledging the cost of Bryce Dunlap’s gift and the family behind it.Cleveland has hosted many Dawg Pound Captains over the years. This one stood apart. Not because of spectacle, but because it reminded everyone in the building that some moments in the NFL have nothing to do with football and everything to do with life.","Cleveland Browns used their final home game to honor Bryce Dunlap’s life-saving organ donation and his mother, Kimberly Dunlap Kane.

Can Virat Kohli chase down Sachin Tendulkar's hundred hundreds?

Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Mohsin Naqvi has made Pakistan’s position clear on the issue of shaking hands with India during cricket matches. Ahead of the ICC T20 World Cup 2026, Naqvi said Pakistan will not force any symbolic gestures if India are not willing to take part.Speaking to the media in Lahore, Naqvi said Pakistan has always believed that cricket and politics should be kept separate.He added that this view has not changed over time and that the message has come from the highest level. According to him, Pakistan also does not want to be treated differently or unfairly.“Our belief remains the same even today, and believe me, the Prime Minister himself has told me twice that we shouldn’t let politics come into all of this. From day one, our stance has been that cricket and politics should remain separate. On that day, Sarfaraz must have told you what kind of attitude was shown, and what it was like,” Naqvi said.He further explained that Pakistan will not insist on shaking hands if India chooses not to.“If they don’t want to shake hands, then we have no particular desire to do so either. Whatever happens, it will happen on an equal footing with India.And you will see, this approach will continue going forward. It’s not possible for them to do one thing and for us to back down — that simply won’t happen.”The handshake issue between India and Pakistan has been ongoing for some time.Since the Pahalgam terror attack , players from both sides have avoided shaking hands in several tournaments.This was seen during the Men’s T20 Asia Cup, the Women’s Cricket World Cup, and the recent Under-19 Asia Cup.However, it all began during the Asia Cup 2025. After a match between India and Pakistan, Indian captain Suryakumar Yadav and his teammates refused to shake hands with the Pakistan players.India said this was done as a protest after the Pahalgam attack.","Mohsin Naqvi says Pakistan will not force any symbolic gestures if India are not willing to take part.

Ex-Rockstar developer has a GTA 6 warning: ‘If the game is delayed again…',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/gaming/ex-rockstar-developer-has-a-gta-6-warning-if-the-game-is-delayed-again/articleshow/126189019.cms,"Former Rockstar developer Mike York warns that further delays to Grand Theft Auto 6 could significantly diminish public interest. He believes Rockstar is prioritizing polish to meet high expectations, but prolonged waits risk alienating fans. York anticipates a November 2026 release, citing it as an optimal period for sales.

“We’ve been waiting so long for

GTA 6

already that if there was to be another delay, people will probably stop caring about its release even more. If

Rockstar

Games delay GTA 6 again then the hype around the game will die down almost completely. Right now, nobody is searching for GTA 6. Everyone knows there’s no news, there’s nothing to talk about… There’s a point to where you delay something so much that you start to make people angry.”

“People aren’t itching to find new details or a latest leak anymore, they’re over it. They are thinking, ‘it will come out when it comes out’, as they’re so burnt out from thinking it will come out soon and then it doesn’t… And then they’re like, ‘OK, whatever…’”

Why Ex-Rockstar developer thinks Rockstar has been delaying the game

“If I know Rockstar Games, and I know the guys over there, one of the reasons for the delay in releasing GTA 6 is because they’re trying to make it look as best as it can possibly be. They’re polishing stuff.

I don’t think they’re completely finished with the game, given how much is on the line and how big everyone’s expectations are for it.”

“I think the game will be released in November 2026 as it’s a good time for the game to come out for Rockstar for multiple reasons to sell video games. If you want to sell a big amount of video games then that’s the perfect time for GTA 6 to come out with it being a month before Christmas. Usually companies only delay these things once or twice when they need to, so I think it will come out around that time,”





Former Rockstar Games developer Mike York has a critical warning for the Take-Two-owned gaming studio. He has warned that the hype and public interest around Grand Theft Auto 6 will “die down” almost completely if the game faces any more delays. In an interview with Esports Insider (as seen by Dexerto), York said:York cited fan reactions showing growing frustration, with some saying they “don’t even care anymore” because repeated delays keep letting them down.he added.The game’s delay from May to November 2026 even caused anger in Poland’s parliament, with an opposition lawmaker calling the postponement “a huge scandal” during a session.Explaining Rockstar’s reason behind GTA 6 delay, York said:York believes Rockstar is aiming to meet very high internal standards and may not feel it has reached that level yet.York noted.Till date, Rockstar has released two official trailers of the highly anticiapted game which have confirmed that GTA 6 is set in a modern Vice City. The game will feature dual protagonists, deeper RPG systems, realistic physics, new heist tools and a more evolving open world.","Former Rockstar developer Mike York warns that further delays to Grand Theft Auto 6 could significantly diminish public interest.
