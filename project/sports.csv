Tony Romo blasted the refs during the CBS broadcast

In CBS broadcasting, former Dallas Cowboys player Tony Romo raised a query about an official's call, which occurred within the first quarter of the playoff game between Buffalo Bills and the Baltimore Ravens for the Divisional Round. On the teams' opening drive, both sides scored touchdowns as Buffalo's attacking drive was put to a screeching halt by a questionable holding call against left tackle Dion Dawkins; the replay ruled him not to have been holding. He made sure the criticism aired on the CBS broadcast,The Buffalo Bills played against the Baltimore Ravens in an AFC playoff match headlined by two of the NFL MVP favorites this season-Lamar Jackson and Josh Allen. Although the Bills were ahead on touchdowns after the first quarter, their drive ended abruptly when it was reduced to a junk situation due to a poor holding call that Tony Romo blasted during the CBS broadcast.The Bills left tackle Dion Dawkins was the lineman who drew the flag but the replay showed he didn't do anything wrong. ""Oh that is not a hold at all, Jim,"" Romo said. ""He just swipes his hands down, a little trap technique which is like when you try to put your hands on him you swipe it down. That‚Äôs a terrible call.‚ÄùFans agreed with Romo on social media but also shared their beliefs that the refs were purposely favoring the Ravens. ""So blatant. Refs are so cheating,"" one wrote. ""Clearly the NFL wants the Ravens to win. Refs not even hiding their favoritism,"" another commented. ""Refs are cheating for them early,"" a third added.The first half of the game was a reprise of Week 4, when two Lamar Jackson turnovers gave the Baltimore a third-quarter deficit of 21-10 after 30 minutes of football in Buffalo. The Bills limited the Ravens to 73 yards rushing and 28 offensive plays. Lamar Jackson was 6-10 passing for 123 yards, one touchdown, one interception, and a 97.1 rating.Jackson also had five carries for 31 yards, but his two turnovers played big. The MVP favourite in some expert's eyes, Josh Allen was 5-7 passing for 69 yards in the first half. Allen had 15 yards rushing in the first half. Baltimore had 182 yards in the first half compared to Buffalo's 156. The Ravens were 4-5 on third downs.Also Read: ‚ÄúWorst owner/joke of the NFL‚Äù: Fans brutally trolls Jerry Jones after the Cowboys' loss to the Commanders The Buffalo Bills punted the ball a few plays later, making each possession in this game very important, and a bad call may well determine the outcome of the game.","Tony Romo blasted the refs during the CBS broadcast of the Buffalo Bills- Baltimore Ravens playoff game.

Kayla Nicole sends bold message to Eagles

Travis Kelce and the Kansas City Chiefs are readying for another AFC Championship after a win over the Houston Texans.

Instead, Nicole issued a warning to Jalen Hurts-led Eagles about the challenge that awaits them in the next week against Jayden Daniels-led Commanders.NFL playoffs mean everything to Travis Kelce's ex-girlfriend, Kayla Nicole, but there is nothing on the Kansas City Chiefs as much as the words on the Philadelphia Eagles after that divisional round win. Here, the Eagles are going head-to-head against the Washington Commanders with a rookie star named Jayden Daniels.Even though Philadelphia won 28-22, the Commanders looked disjointed on the field, threatening to be a major upset to Super Bowl hopefuls. Eagles are likely to take advantage of any weaknesses that the game might have.Nicole warned the Eagles on her Twitter about the challenge of their NFC championship game against Daniels-led Commanders. ""Eagles fans. Happy for you, real cute. But that‚Äôs not gone cut it next weekend. I‚Äôm telling you right now,"" she wrote.The Eagles relied heavily on Saquon Barkley for their offense, while Jalen Hurts' performance was limited, with a 126-yard completion average. The Los Angeles Rams also criticized Barkley's performance as they rushed for 205 yards and two touchdowns compared to his franchise record of 302 yards.Saquon Barkley's pressure might increase in the NFC Championship game because of concerns over Hurts' availability. Fans are already angry with his performance, and if he gets enrolled on injury reserve, things may get worse.

The Los Angeles Dodgers Have Reached A ‚ÄúTentative Agreement‚Äù With Kirby Yates And Fans Are Not Happy About It



Kirby Yates‚Äô Career In MLB So Far



Kirby Yates , the star pitcher and one of the most talented players in Major League Baseball, became a free agent at the end of the 2024 season of MLB. After an impressive run on the field, he is yet to join a team for the upcoming season of MLB. But it looks like the star pitcher might just be signing a contract in the next few days; he has reportedly reached a ‚Äútentative agreement‚Äù with one of the strongest teams in the MLB, the Los Angeles Dodgers , according to Bob Nightengale of USA Today.The news of Kirby Yates‚Äô ‚Äútentative agreement‚Äù with the World Series champion, the Los Angeles Dodgers comes shortly after the team has acquired Tanner Scott for a whopping $72 million for a four year period. The Los Angeles Dodgers have also recently been in the news for acquiring international sensation Roki Sasaki, even though multiple teams were trying to acquire him.This has set off the MLB fans as many are confused about the reason behind the Los Angeles Dodgers‚Äô acquisitions in the recent few weeks. A fan took to X and wrote, ‚ÄúThis stinks for the rest of the teams (who could do these moves, too, by the way), but at least the entire league has a collective villain now. Also, expanded playoffs and randomness of the postseason don't make their World Series a guarantee.‚ÄùAnother fan wrote, ‚ÄúSo they win the World Series, add Ohtani, Snell and Sasaki to the rotation, then add Scott and Yates???! To the team that scored the 2nd most runs?!‚Äù Many fans are vowing to not watch MLB anymore, as a fan wrote, ‚ÄúLike the NFL and NBA, MLB is almost unwatchable‚Ä¶‚ÄùHowever, neither the World Series champion, the Los Angeles Dodgers‚Äô team management nor the star pitcher, Kirby Yates, have issued any official statements about this situation.Kirby Yates has consistently proved his worth on the field after making a debut in the MLB back in 2014 with the Tampa Bay Rays. After spending two years with the Tampa Bay Rays, he was traded to the Cleveland Indians and then subsequently to the New York Yankees. Later he made the move to the Los Angeles Angels and then to the San Diego Padres.Just before the 2021 season of Major League Baseball was about to begin, Kirby signed a one year contract with the Toronto Blue Jays for a whopping $5.1 million. However, unfortunately, he had to undergo surgery and could not participate in the 2021 season of Major League Baseball.In 2022, Kirby signed with the Atlanta Braves for a two year deal worth $8.25 million and then ultimately joined the Texas Rangers in the last season.Also Read: ""It had to be a really really big offer"": Teoscar Hern√°ndez reveals why he chose to stay with the Dodgers","Kirby Yates, the star pitcher and one of the most talented players in Major League Baseball, became a free agent at the end of the 2024 season of MLB.

Jalen Hurts' injury clouds victory, NFC Championship uncertainty

Jalen Hurts' knee injury comes after a challenging performance in the Eagles' 28-22 victory over the Los Angeles Rams on January 19, 2025. Hurts was sacked seven times during the game, which led to concerns about his knee. The injury worsened following the sacks, and while Hurts did return to finish the game, the damage to his knee was concerning. Despite this, there have been positive updates regarding his recovery.Jalen Hurts, the 26-year-old quarterback for the Philadelphia Eagles, led his team to a hard-fought 28-22 victory against the Los Angeles Rams on January 19, 2025, in the NFC Divisional Round. Despite the win, Hurts appeared to struggle with an injury, having been sacked a staggering seven times during the game. These sacks took a toll on his body, particularly his left knee, which he seemed to favor after the game.At full-time, Hurts was seen limping as he made his way back to the locker room, further fueling concerns about the severity of his injury. Although he had continued to play through discomfort, there were increasing fears that this knee issue could potentially limit his performance for the remainder of the season, including the upcoming NFC Championship game.After the game, when asked about his health, Hurts gave a cryptic response, avoiding specifics about whether he was injured. He declined to reveal any potential issues that might affect his availability for the Eagles' upcoming NFC Championship game against the Washington Commanders on January 26, 2025.Throughout the game, Hurts took several concerning hits, raising concerns about his ability to continue at a high level. One notable moment came in the first half, where he limped after a hit, but the most alarming instance occurred in the third quarter when a Rams' defensive back trapped his left leg during a tackle. This left leg injury required Hurts to be taken to the medical tent for an evaluation by the team physicians.""Jalen Hurts hates nothing more than talking about his injuries,"" Ian Rapoport, an insider for NFL Network, told Good Morning Football. ""So I am expecting an awkward, tense week but I do expect him to play.""In the harsh snowy conditions of the January 19, 2025, NFC Divisional Round game between the Philadelphia Eagles and the Los Angeles Rams, Hurts' performance in the air attack was influenced by the weather. Hurts completed just 15 of his throwing attempts, finishing with a completion percentage of 75%. He passed for 128 yards, a relatively modest total in comparison to his usual figures, as the adverse weather made it more difficult to execute the passing game smoothly.Despite the rough conditions, Hurts showcased his dual-threat capability on the ground. He rushed for 70 yards, scoring a crucial rushing touchdown. His agility, both in the air and on the ground, played a pivotal role in the Eagles' victory, as they were able to depend on his ability to make plays outside the pocket when the passing game lacked rhythm.Jalen Hurts' rushing touchdown also proved decisive in securing the win as his overall performance helped the Eagles advance to the NFC Championship game. While the weather affected his passing statistics, Hurts' resolve and adaptability were fully evident as he guided his team through difficult conditions to secure the vital playoff triumph.Also Read: Texans‚Äô quarterback CJ Stroud has shed light on the uncertain future of star receiver Stefon Diggs Although Jalen Hurts' injury is still a worry, his past ability to play through tough situations and the team's confidence in his recovery suggest he'll be ready for the NFC Championship Game.

NEW DELHI: The highly anticipated India vs England series kicks off at Eden Gardens in Kolkata on Wednesday, January 22, marking the beginning of a five-match T20I contest between two evenly matched sides. This white-ball series, which also includes three ODIs, serves as a crucial preparatory ground for both teams ahead of next month‚Äôs Champions Trophy.For India, the spotlight will be on the fit-again Mohammed Shami, who returns to the squad after recovering from an ankle injury that sidelined him following the ODI World Cup final loss to Australia in November 2023. His comeback, particularly in the absence of pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah, who is nursing a back injury, holds significant importance for India‚Äôs bowling attack.India‚Äôs T20 squad, led by Suryakumar Yadav, features several players under scrutiny. Axar Patel steps into the role of vice-captain, rewarded for his impressive performances during India‚Äôs T20 World Cup triumph in the Caribbean last year. Sanju Samson, omitted from India‚Äôs Champions Trophy squad, will look to make a strong case for himself, especially after his record-breaking T20I performances against South Africa. Meanwhile, promising all-rounder Nitish Kumar Reddy, fresh off a maiden Test century in Australia, adds depth to the side.Skipper Suryakumar Yadav, showering plaudits on head coach Gambhir ahead of the firs T20I, said, ""I've had the privilege of spending a lot of time with him. I know how he works. Without saying a word, he can read your mind. His coaching style is very simple. He gives us a lot of freedom and allows players to express themselves. He keeps everything straightforward and understands what's going on in the minds of the players. He ensures a light, relaxed atmosphere in the dressing room, which helps players perform at their best. We're definitely moving in the right direction.""England, under the leadership of Jos Buttler and head coach Brendon McCullum, also aims to rebound after a disappointing T20 World Cup campaign.The series comes at a critical juncture for both teams. India are seeking redemption after a horror Test series in Australia, while England are embarking on a new era under McCullum‚Äôs guidance. With dew expected to play a significant role in Indian conditions, the bowlers will face a stern test in what promises to be a high-scoring series.","India vs England T20I series kicks off at Eden Gardens in Kolkata on January 22.

Last season helped build confidence with him that, ‚ÄòHey, I am able to do this‚Äô ‚Äî that was the first time he had ever played third on an everyday basis.""

""I'm pretty sure he's up there in the picking stats. He's good at digging balls out. I believe I could be wrong but I'm pretty sure he rates pretty solid as a first baseman. He's still a pretty good athlete, but I do think the modern-day first baseman is more athletic in general than before,""

""I'm not exactly sure what his numbers were last year, I think they were down a little bit from kind of his best years. But my guess would be he's holding out for more years or more money than some of these teams are willing to go to for whatever reason,""

While Pete Alonso has been struggling with finding the perfect next home for himself, his former team the New York Mets has figured out which player to promote to the first baseman's spot. Mets' coach Mike Sarbaugh recently hinted at the potential ""better"" replacement for Alonso following his rejection of a $70 Million contract extension offer from the team. Here‚Äôs everything Sabaugh revealed about Alonso‚Äôs replacement.The offseason is near its conclusion but Pete Alonso hasn‚Äôt been anywhere close to getting signed for the 2025 MLB season. While on one hand Alonso faces battles with signing, on the other hand, his former team, New York Mets, have already figured out an athlete for the first baseman's position.New York Mets coach Mike Sarbaugh was recently interviewed by the New York Post. During the interview, Sarbaugh teased at the possibility of Mark Vientos , the third baseman, to get a promotion and be replaced in Pete Alonso's position ahead of the 2025 MLB season. Talking about the same, Sarbaugh said:Mark Vientos came into the spotlight of the fans last season when he slugged 27 home runs with a .266/.322/.516/.837 slash line in an impressive total of 111 games. Despite his struggles with the defensive metrics, Vientos ended up with a bWAR rating of 3.2, hinting that he definitely has the potential to be playing first baseman.Since there's nothing finalized yet, there's still a chance that Pete Alonso might get back to the Mets despite rejecting their previous offer. MLB Analyst Brin O'Grady recently appeared on the podcast episode of ""Justin Ayers Baseball"", during which he opened up about the ideology behind why Alonso's offer rejections make sense.O'Grady said.O'Grady added.While Mike Sarbaugh thinks Mark Vientos has what it takes to be the first baseman, do you think he's the perfect replacement for Pete Alonso?","Pete Alonso hasn't been anywhere close to getting signed for the 2025 MLB season.

Champions Trophy Squad: Chief selector Ajit Agarkar and skipper Rohit Sharma PC

Dubai International Stadium tour: India's base for Champions Trophy glory

NEW DELHI: Former Indian spinner Ravichandran Ashwin has raised concerns about the Indian squad for the ICC Champions Trophy scheduled to start from February 19 in Pakistan and the UAE. He pointed out the lack of left-handed batters in the top seven and the absence of a reliable No. 8 batter.Ashwin shared his analysis on his YouTube channel, suggesting that the squad mirrors the team composition for the 2023 ODI World Cup . He mentioned the likely batting order, with Rohit Sharma and Shubman Gill opening, followed by Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul , and a choice between Ravindra Jadeja and Axar Patel at No. 6, with Hardik Pandya at No. 7.""This squad mirrors the 2023 ODI World Cup,"" Ashwin remarked. ""Rohit Sharma and Shubman Gill open, both right-handed. Then there's Virat Kohli. Shreyas Iyer likely bats at 4, given his strong performance in the World Cup. KL Rahul follows. At No. 6, it's a choice between Ravindra Jadeja and Axar Patel. Hardik occupies No. 7. We lack left-handed batters in the top seven. Outside the XI, we have Yashasvi Jaiswal and Rishabh Pant.""Ashwin questioned the role of Yashasvi Jaiswal in the squad, wondering if he would get a chance to play unless there were injuries. He suggested that if Jaiswal were to play, it could lead to changes in the batting order, with Shreyas Iyer potentially being dropped.""Jaiswal might only play if someone gets injured. He could have a chance against England. But what if he scores consecutive centuries? One option is to open with Jaiswal and Rohit, pushing Shubman to 3, followed by Virat at 4. This would place either Rishabh Pant or KL Rahul at 5. If Jaiswal plays, Shreyas Iyer would likely be dropped. While unlikely, India must capitalise on Jaiswal's current form,"" he said.Ashwin also highlighted Washington Sundar as a potential addition to the playing XI, citing coach Gautam Gambhir 's belief in Sundar's batting abilities. He discussed various scenarios involving Sundar and the team's balance.""Another scenario involves Washington Sundar. Gautam Gambhir highly values Washington due to his batting. He can also be used as a floater. If you follow the World Cup format, you play either Jaddu or Axar at No. 6, Hardik at 7, and Washington at 8. This allows for three fast bowlers or Kuldeep and two pacers, maintaining balance with Hardik's all-round skills,"" he added.Ashwin emphasised the impact of dew in Dubai, where India will play all their matches. He questioned whether playing three spinners would be a viable option and suggested that Nitish Kumar Reddy could have been a valuable addition to the squad.""Ideally, Washington should bat at 8. Does it make sense to have a player like Nitish Reddy in the scheme of things? If Kuldeep plays at 9, it's two pacers and three spinners. With Nitish, he could bat at 8, allowing Kuldeep at 9 and two fast bowlers. This would provide the luxury of four fast bowlers and two spinners. I don't know if he was considered.""Ashwin concluded by stating that India will likely stick to the World Cup template, acknowledging the challenges of excluding key players like KL Rahul. He noted the lack of batting depth from No. 8 onwards in the 2023 World Cup and emphasised the need to address these crucial questions.""Washington Sundar at 8 might not be feasible if dew is a major factor. In that case, Kuldeep Yadav would bat at 8, and the team would likely go with all seamers ‚Äì Arshdeep, Bumrah, and Shami. In the 2023 World Cup, we lacked batting depth from No. 8 onwards. These are the crucial questions that need to be addressed,"" Ashwin stated.",Former Indian spinner Ravichandran Ashwin has raised concerns about the Indian squad for the ICC Champions Trophy.

KOLKATA: The Eden Gardens pitch has always been praised during the IPL. Wednesday's T20I match between India and England, however, is happening at a different time of the year. While the spectators will prefer the chill in the air over the summer heat, the ground staff is having a nightmare keep the dew under check.It will not be a fresh wicket as several age-group matches have taken place at this venue during the ongoing domestic season. But the ground staff under the guidance of curator Sujan Mukherjee , has worked hard to prepare a sporting track for this match.The wicket will have some grass and bounce for the pacers, but with heavy dew setting in after sunset for the past few days, it will be a challenge for the bowlers to control the wet ball. As the dew is setting in early, it is expected that both the sides will be equally affected by the conditions.This, India skipper Suryakumar Yadav feels, will neutralise the advantage of winning the toss. ""The conditions will be the same for both the teams,"" he said in the pre-match press conference on Tuesday.""Last evening, there was quite a bit of dew by seven o'clock when the game will start,"" England skipper Jos Buttler stated on match-eve. ""I'm sure they'll (ground staff) probably spray the outfield, which can have an effect. But yeah, I think it's just important to be aware of that and how that will affect the ball,"" the skipper added.Accordingly, the teams have practised with the wet ball too.""I think in all facets as well, you need to practice sometimes with a wet ball as a bowler and certainly as fielders as well. The batters should also take into account how that may affect your plans,"" Buttler added.""You start preparing with the wet ball,"" Surya stated.The ground staff is keeping the wicket mostly under covers and has worked hard to keep the moisture under control.","The wicket will have some grass and bounce for the pacers, but with heavy dew setting in after sunset for the past few days, it will be a challenge for the bowlers to control the wet ball.

Chiefs Celebrate Travis Kelce‚Äôs Historic Playoff Feat With a 4-Word Message That Has Fans Talking



What Is Travis Kelce's Postseason Win-Loss Record? A Look at His Playoff Journey



Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce reminded the NFL world why he is regarded as one of the greatest postseason performers in league history during Saturday‚Äôs AFC Divisional Round win against the Houston Texans at GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium. Despite a relatively subdued regular season by his lofty standards, Kelce delivered a historic performance, showcasing his ability to excel on the biggest stage.In a game where he had something to prove, Travis Kelce wasted no time making his presence felt. In the second quarter, he caught a 49-yard pass from quarterback Patrick Mahomes‚Äîhis longest postseason reception to date. It was also his first play of the season with more than 20 yards after the catch, underscoring his knack for rising to the occasion. That play alone eclipsed his receiving yardage total in eight regular-season games, marking a turning point in his playoff campaign.By the third quarter, Kelce‚Äôs dominance became undeniable. An 18-yard reception pushed him past 100 yards for the game, making it his ninth career postseason 100-yard performance. In doing so, Kelce surpassed Hall of Famer Jerry Rice for the most 100-yard playoff games in NFL history, achieving the milestone in just his 23rd postseason appearance. He finished the game with seven receptions for 117 yards and a crucial touchdown, helping the Chiefs secure a 23-14 victory and their seventh consecutive trip to the AFC Championship Game.Kelce‚Äôs contributions weren‚Äôt limited to record-breaking stats. His fourth-quarter touchdown gave Kansas City a comfortable 20-12 lead, proving pivotal in sealing the win. Reflecting on his performance, the Chiefs celebrated his achievements on social media, aptly stating, ‚ÄúPlayoff Trav is different.‚ÄùFor the 35-year-old Kelce, this performance reaffirms his status as an all-time great. With career totals of 1,004 receptions, 12,151 receiving yards, and 77 touchdowns, his regular-season legacy is cemented. However, it‚Äôs his postseason heroics‚Äîstepping up when it matters most‚Äîthat continue to define him. As Mahomes put it best, Kelce rises to greatness when the stakes are highest, proving yet again why he remains a vital part of the Chiefs‚Äô dynasty aspirations.As the tight end for the Kansas City Chiefs, Travis Kelce has consistently delivered in the most high-pressure moments, becoming an indispensable figure in the Chiefs‚Äô remarkable playoff success. His ability to dominate when it matters most has placed him in a league of his own among NFL greats.Kelce‚Äôs playoff resume is nothing short of extraordinary. With a career postseason record of 17-6, he has participated in 23 playoff games, amassing 172 receptions‚Äîthe most in NFL postseason history. His 2,020 receiving yards place him second only to Jerry Rice, while his 20 postseason touchdowns make him one of only two players alongside Rice to achieve at least 2,000 receiving yards and 20 touchdowns in the playoffs. Notably, in the 2025 AFC Divisional Round, Kelce surpassed Jerry Rice‚Äôs record by recording his ninth playoff game with over 100 receiving yards.Also Read: Why Is the Super Bowl LIX Referees Being Dubbed ""The Mahomes Crew""? A three-time Super Bowl champion (2020, 2023, 2024), Kelce‚Äôs influence has been crucial in Kansas City‚Äôs success. With four Super Bowl appearances, his legacy is defined not just by records but also by his knack for game-changing plays in critical moments. As the Chiefs gear up to face the Buffalo Bills in the AFC Championship, they‚Äôll undoubtedly rely on Kelce‚Äôs postseason magic once again.","Travis Kelce is regarded as one of the greatest postseason performers in NFL history.

Recognizing Svitolina's early dominance, she opted for a more aggressive approach, taking the initiative and attacking the net more frequently. This tactical shift paid dividends, allowing Keys to wrest control of the rallies and dictate the pace of the match.""I felt like I kind of just had to start playing a little bit more aggressive and try to get to the net a little bit quicker,"" Keys said after the match.The 29-year-old's mental fortitude was also on full display.

A series win vs England could lift the mood in India camp before

All eyes on Shami

KOLKATA: There are some scars that take time to heal. But time is at a premium for coach Gautam Gambhir as the knives are out since India lost the Border-Gavaskar Trophy Down Under.With the Champions Trophy just a month away, it's important that the Indian dressing room gets a breath of fresh air. Gambhir knows only a series win can change the mood fast as nothing succeeds like success.The Suryakumar Yadav-led side thus has a responsibility to lift the morale of Indian cricket by scripting a victory against England in the five-match T20I series which kicks-off at the Eden Gardens here on Wednesday.India will definitely start as favourites as they are yet to lose a bilateral series since winning the T20 World Cup in Barbados last year. The Men in Blue will go in with their tails up having won five of their last seven matches against England in this format. However, only five players of that World Cup winning side are in this India side with stars like Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli and Ravindra Jadeja having quit this format.But youngsters like Abhishek Sharma and Tilak Varma have chipped in well as worthy replacements. Opener Sanju Samson will look to make a statement since being ignored for the CT after having scored three tons in his last five T20I innings.Varma's emergence as a strong player in the middle-order after hammering two T20I hundreds last year will surely reduce the pressure on the skipper, who himself can turn a match on its head.It remains to be seen whether India's latest sensation Nitish Kumar Reddy , who will provide another pace bowling option to the side, gets a game over Rinku Singh, who has not been in the best of form recently.India will look to comeback man Mohammed Shami and left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh, India's highest wicket-taker in the last T20 World Cup with 17 scalps in eight matches, to provide early breakthroughs and put the brakes on a strong English batting line-up.The visitors might not have fared well in the shortest format in recent times, but they are hopeful of a turnaround now that Brendon McCullum has taken over as the coach. The coach also sounded optimistic about England's chances.""We've got a batting line-up which is as powerful as any other in the world. We've got gun spinners, very good fielders and guys who bowl absolute rockets, so you've got options and give yourself the greatest chance of success,"" he said.To begin with their 34-year-old skipper Jos Buttler will bat at No. 3 and relinquish the gloves in this series. Phil Salt, who smashed 1,381 T20 runs last year at a phenomenal strike-rate of 166.18, will continue in the role he took on for the series in the Caribbean last Nov and will open the batting with Ben Duckett.However, all eyes will be on young left-hander Jacob Bethell, who had done brilliantly coming into international cricket hitting two fifties at a strike rate of 167.96 in the seven T20Is so far. Facing a problem of plenty, McCullum would have struggled to finally decide on his pace-heavy bowling line-up with Mark Wood and Jofra Archer both back after injury issues along with Jamie Overton and Gus Atkinson.Adil Rashid will be their only specialised spinner.""I think we're very fortunate that a lot of our bowlers are very, very capable batters,"" Buttler sounded a warning too.",Gautam Gambhir knows only a series win can change the mood in India camp.

The second week of the 2025 SA20 season saw spinners stealing the spotlight, taking nearly as many wickets as pacers despite bowling 200 fewer deliveries overall. Spinners averaged almost seven runs per wicket fewer than their pace counterparts and conceded 1.54 fewer runs per over, underscoring their effectiveness.The degree of turn varied significantly across venues, with Durban (2.94¬∞), Gqeberha (2.88¬∞), and Johannesburg (2.68¬∞) offering far more assistance to spinners compared to Paarl, Cape Town, and Centurion, where the average turn was below 2.00¬∞.Left-handed batters particularly struggled against finger spin, suffering 15 dismissals at an average of 14.53, with nine of these coming against off-spin - a classic spin matchup. Meanwhile, right-handed batters found wrist spin challenging, averaging 22 while striking at just 102. In contrast, left-handers fared much better against wrist spin, striking at nearly 129 with a superior average, highlighting an intriguing trend to monitor.Amid the dominance of spin, left-arm wrist spinner Noor Ahmad stood out despite his team languishing at the bottom of the table. Noor claimed five wickets this week at an average of 15.80 and an economy of 6.58, solidifying his reputation as a game-changer on turning tracks.Noor's skill lies not just in his turn but also in his ability to generate drift through the air. Compared to other left-arm wrist spinners, Noor consistently produces more drift and effectively moves the ball away from right-handers before turning it back in. This unique ability sets him apart from the likes of Tabraiz Shamsi and Kuldeep Yadav.Left-handed batters could be key to countering Noor, but his sharp googly ensures that even they are not entirely safe. Sunrisers Eastern Cape 's Jordan Hermann learned this the hard way when Noor targeted his stumps with precision. With such a versatile skillset, Noor Ahmad continues to be a near cheat code for T20 cricket when conditions favor spin.Strong starts remain crucial in any format, and the SA20 has been no exception. Winning teams have lost half as many wickets in the Powerplay compared to their losing counterparts and have also scored at nearly one run per over faster.Table-toppers MI Cape Town and Paarl Royals exemplify the importance of Powerplay batting. MI Cape Town's Rassie van der Dussen (97 runs) and Paarl Royals' Joe Root (96 runs) and Lhuan-dre Pretorius (93 runs) lead the Powerplay scoring charts.The Royals' left-right opening combination of Root and Pretorius has been formidable, with at least one of them remaining set after the Powerplay in three of their four matches. Pretorius has been particularly destructive, striking at 196 in overs 4-6, while Root has yet to be dismissed inside the first three overs this season.MI Cape Town's van der Dussen may not score quickly in the Powerplay, striking at 118, but his wicket conservation has been invaluable, as he remains unbeaten in the Powerplay after five games. His steady approach is perfectly complemented by Ryan Rickelton , who smashed 30 off 16 in the Powerplay during his blistering 89 (39) against Joburg Super Kings. Together, van der Dussen and Rickelton form an ideal balance of stability and aggression for the table-toppers.",Spinners take nearly as many wickets as pacers despite bowling 200 fewer deliveries overall.

Boomer Esiason and Gregg Giannotti on Tom Brady's dual roles as an NFL broadcaster and a minority owner

The controversy surrounding Tom Brady's dual roles as an NFL broadcaster for Fox and a minority owner of the Las Vegas Raiders has recently escalated. Brady called the Lions-Commanders game and asked for interviews for Detroit OC Ben Johnson for the Raiders' head coaching opening. He acknowledged the situation but did not mention Johnson by name.Minority owner of the Las Vegas Raiders Tom Brady is not having any thought about leaving FOX to become the main color commentator. The head of a Fox Sports executive actually called it ""ridiculous,"" while his agent, Don Yee confirmed that he'll be returning next season to the booth.Although Brady's conflict may not be important to many Fox viewers, it did affect his words and actions in some instances. WFAN hosts Boomer Esiason and Gregg Giannotti believe it is a conflict of interest because Brady is very involved in the Raiders' coaching search.‚ÄúThey really are sticking to this, that Tom Brady‚Äôs gonna continue broadcasting, which to me, is insanity if he is pulling the strings and being a major player in the decision-making of an NFL organization,‚Äù Giannoti said on Monday‚Äôs Boomer & Gio. ‚ÄúAnd then he‚Äôs calling games on top of it? It‚Äôs weird!‚Äù""Yeah, it‚Äôs 100% a conflict of interest but that $375 million that FOX game Tom Brady to do this ten-year deal probably was a lot of money that went into the Raiders I would think,"" Esiason said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs made so much money in his career, and he‚Äôs obviously one of the most popular players in the history, and no matter where he goes, and if he decides to give a speaking engagement, I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs probably for at least a half a million to a million dollars.‚ÄùHe added, ‚ÄúAnd he‚Äôs pretty good when he goes into those situations and he‚Äôs very sought after. But, I agree with you. It‚Äôs a conflict of interest. I don‚Äôt know what the commissioner is doing. I guess the commissioner is really not gonna get involved in this. Because, it is Tom Brady.‚ÄùGiannotti noted Roger Goodell's history of pursuing Tom Brady during player scandals, while Esasion believes Brady's owner is a different entity. Esiason admires Brady for embracing criticism in a broadcasting booth, comparing it to ManningCast, a niche show that attracts a diverse audience.Also Read: Tom Brady was reportedly shocked by his ex-wife Gisele B√ºndchen's pregnancy news Brady is expected to call the NFC Championship Game between the Commanders and Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday before Super Bowl LIX in February, as FOX has this year's game, as the Super Bowl rotates between major networks each year.

PCB

deeply upset at BCCI's fresh demands

Poll Do You Support India‚Äôs Decision to Exclude Pakistan‚Äôs Name From Jerseys? No, Sports Should Be Free of Political Considerations Yes, The Team Should Represent National Pride

MUMBAI: A fresh controversy has erupted over Champions Trophy to be held in Pakistan and UAE in February-March.TOI has learnt BCCI doesn't want its players to wear jerseys with the name of Pakistan, the host nation, displayed on it.BCCI is also firm that skipper Rohit Sharma won't travel to Pakistan for the captains' press conference and photo shoot.According to a BCCI source, the board has requested ICC to shift the twin events, which take place just before the tournament takes off on Feb 19, from Pakistan to Dubai.""ICC has already accommodated India's request to not schedule its CT matches in Pakistan, so these are minor issues,"" the source told TOI on Tuesday.The decision by BCCI has left the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) peeved and it is hoping for ICC's intervention in the matter.""The BCCI is bringing politics into cricket, which is not at all good for the game. They refused to travel to Pakistan. They don't want to send their captain (to Pakistan) for the opening ceremony. Now there are reports that they don't want the host nation's (Pakistan) name printed on their jerseys. We believe that the world governing body (ICC) will not let this happen and support Pakistan,"" a PCB official told IANS on condition of anonymity.As per the rules, India not wearing the official logo of the hosts, in this case Pakistan, will be a breach of ICC's official clothing code.According to the tradition of ICC tournaments, it is customary for the participating teams to feature the host nation's name on their jersey even if the tournament is being held elsewhere.For example, Pakistan's jersey during the 2021 T20 World Cup featured India's name on it despite the tournament taking place in the UAE.Also, when Pakistan participated in the 2016 T20 World Cup and 2023 ODI World Cup in India, they had the host nation's name on their jerseys.BCCI's decision will add to the ongoing tension between BCCI and PCB. The former has already refused to travel to Pakistan and India will play their fixtures in the UAE.The eight-team tournament will commence on Feb 19 and will conclude on March 9. The 15 matches in the competition will be hosted across four venues - Dubai, Karachi, Lahore and Rawalpindi.","Champions Trophy to be held in Pakistan and UAE in February-March.

Axar Patel hints at flexible middle-order ahead of England T20I series

NEW DELHI: The National Anti-Doping Agency (Nada) has expanded its purview and included more elite cricketers in its comprehensive anti-doping programme. Nada has prepared a new roster of names under the 'Registered Testing Pool' (RTP) for the year 2025. The list includes several top, centrally-contracted cricketers ‚Äì men's T20I captain Suryakumar Yadav , Test vice-captain Jasprit Bumrah , ODI team vice-captain Shubman Gill and wicketkeeper-batsman Rishabh Pant being the prominent ones.Hardik Pandya, Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Arshdeep Singh , Sanju Samson and Tilak Verma are also in the new list. The women cricketers in the list are opener Shafali Verma, all-rounder Deepti Sharma and medium pacer Renuka Singh Thakur.A total of 14 men and women cricketers are in the current RTP along with athletes from other disciplines.It has been ascertained that Nada's dope control officers (DCOs) will be collecting urine samples of some cricketers in the RTP during the upcoming white-ball series against visiting England. The DCOs will visit different match venues. BCCI has been notified accordingly.Nada had, in September 2019, created the RTP of cricketers for both men and women, including Cheteshwar Pujara, Ravindra Jadeja, KL Rahul, Smriti Mandhana and Deepti Sharma. This was the first set of cricketers who had shared their ‚Äòwhereabouts' details with Nada DCOs for remaining available to give their urine samples for testing.In June 2020, Nada had let off Pujara, Jadeja, Rahul, Mandhana and Sharma for their failure to disclose their whereabouts. The cricketers were given a simple ""warning"" by Nada after admitting BCCI's contention that the whereabouts' ‚Äòfiling failure' happened due to a password glitch and the inability to access the BCCI office due to the Covid-induced lockdown.Athletes who are part of the RTP, are required to provide whereabouts information which will then be utilised by Nada to locate them for an effective out-of-competition sample collection process.The whereabouts information comprises residence address, email address and phone number; an address for overnight accommodations; regular activities, such as training, work, and the locations and times of these activities; competition schedules and locations and a 60-minute time slot for each day where they will be available and accessible for testing and liable for a potential ‚Äòmissed test'.Any combination of three filing failures or missed tests in a 12-month period may result in an anti-doping rule violation (ADRV). With the inclusion of cricketers, the Nada's RTP of athletes, including that from Olympic disciplines, stands at 227 sportspersons.","The National Anti-Doping Agency (Nada) has expanded its purview and included more elite cricketers in its comprehensive anti-doping programme.

NEW DELHI: The cricketing world has gone into a frenzy since legendary South African batter AB de Villiers , affectionately called "" Mr. 360 "", recently hinted at the possibility of a comeback from retirement during an interview with journalist Melinda Farrell.Known for his innovative stroke play and ability to dominate bowlers on any given day, de Villiers retired from all formats in 2021.However, his recent comments have rekindled hope among fans eager to see the South African maestro in action again.""I might still play cricket one day,"" de Villiers teased. ""No confirmation whatsoever, but I‚Äôm starting to feel it.

""Who knows? But we'll see. I'm gonna try it again and see if this eye is still working. It's a bit blurry, but this (the right one) is the dominant one, and it's working fine. So I'm doing it for my kids and see if I can go out there and enjoy cricket again.""When asked about role models like 45-year-old Imran Tahir still actively playing, de Villiers expressed admiration. ""I'll maybe ask him to be in my team wherever I go. Just remember this: he's one of my favourite players. Nothing serious, though. We're not talking about RCB and big stuff. Yes, I don't want to feel that pressure again. That's the thing. So, wherever I go, I'll have a bit of fun.""One of the most feared cricketers during his time, de Villiers played 114 Tests, 228 ODIs, and 78 T20Is, in which he broke numerous records, including the fastest fifty, century, and 150 in ODI cricket.Having become a pivotal part of the Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) in the Indian Premier League, de Villiers started his YouTube channel and has tried his hands at cricket commentary too.","Legendary South African cricketer AB de Villiers hints at comeback from retirement.

The Sri Lankan Perera was the first to leave for 23 soon before the powerplay ended, following a 42-run partnership between the two players. Tom Banton entered, and he and Waseem made sure the MI Emirates maintained the run rate.Banton was out for nine around the halfway point of the innings, while Waseem was out for 38 shortly after. Kieron Pollard replaced skipper Nicholas Pooran, but the seasoned right-hander struggled to get going and was eventually sent out for five by Ali Khan. With just over 6 overs remaining, the score was at 102/4.Following Dan Mousley's dismissal for six, Romario Shepherd joined his skipper for the innings' last stretch. Jason Holder made a solid 49, but Pooran, who was hitting it cleanly, was almost at his half-century before he fell.Shepherd was given more attention in the last few overs as a result. In order to end with an undefeated 38 from 13 deliveries, the powerful right-hander then moved through the gears and hammered three maximums and four boundaries. After slowing down for a few overs in the middle, the MI Emirates eventually reached 186/6.With openers Kyle Mayers and Andries Gous attacking the MI Emirates bowlers, the Abu Dhabi Knight Riders got off to a fast start.

Hardik Pandya still key to leadership group: Suryakumar Yadav

NEW DELHI: In light of India's declining performance, Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) president Snehasish Ganguly supported head coach Gautam Gambhir and believes he should be given more time.The Indian squad has been in ruins ever since Gambhir took over as head coach and started the era with his regime selections, particularly in the Test format.It all began when, for the first time in 27 years, India lost a bilateral ODI series to Sri Lanka. After defeating Bangladesh in the home series, India enjoyed a little breather, but things quickly deteriorated.When New Zealand arrived in India, they stunned the hosts with an incredible display. On paper, India was expected to easily defeat the Kiwis in red-ball cricket, particularly at home. However, the home citadel was breached, and India experienced a historic whitewash for the first time in 24 years.A further blow to India's already open wounds was the Border-Gavaskar Trophy . India suffered a 1-3 series loss and lost the coveted title for the first time in ten years.The current situation of the modern giants has gotten worse as a result of reports of the continuous rift inside the Indian team.Ganguly stepped in to support the struggling coach as the Indian team is in disarray and there is question over the future of the team's Indian stalwarts.""I feel happy because of his approach. As a coach, he got success for KKR after 12 years. We should give him some time. It has been some months since he has been handling the team after Rahul Dravid ,"" Ganguly told ANI.The next test for Gambhir will be a five-match Twenty20 International series against England, which starts in Kolkata on Wednesday.The three One-Day Internationals (ODIs) that will follow the five-match contest will be the perfect platform to get ready for the Champions Trophy next month.Ganguly was also excited with Mohammed Shami 's comeback to the field. Shami will perform in front of an enthusiastic Kolkata crowd making his comeback after a year.When discussing Shami's comeback, Ganguly emphasized the pacer's recent exploits for Bengal, where he participated in six to seven games and showed outstanding form.""The most important thing is the whole Kolkata crowd will be watching Mohammed Shami,"" Ganguly said.""He came back after a year and bowled very well for Bengal. I was observing his bowling, and he seems to be in great shape. He looks like the old Mohammed Shami--fit and raring to go,"" Ganguly added.Ganguly said he was confident in Shami's potential to have a big effect because the bowler appeared sharp and prepared for the contest.""Overall, it will be a very good match,"" he noted, emphasizing the excitement surrounding Shami's return to Eden Gardens .",Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) president Snehasish Ganguly supports head coach Gautam Gambhir.

The No. 3 seed was eliminated by the 27-year-old Spaniard, who secured a straight-set victory, 7-5, 6-4, to advance to her maiden Grand Slam semifinal.Gauff, riding high on a 13-match winning streak and a flawless 9-0 record in 2025, entered the match brimming with confidence following her triumph at the WTA Finals last November. Despite her momentum, the 2023 US Open champion struggled to maintain consistency, committing 41 unforced errors, including six costly double faults and 28 missed forehands. Her serve woes were particularly evident, with a double fault handing Badosa a critical break to lead 5-2 in the second set.Badosa, seeded No. 11, displayed remarkable composure and resilience. ""She‚Äôs full of confidence. But I‚Äôm playing well, too,"" Badosa said before the match. Her confidence proved justified as she outmaneuvered Gauff in key moments, neutralizing the American's typically dominant baseline game.Gauff's inability to generate a single break point until late in the second set further highlighted her struggles. By the time she began to mount a resistance, the deficit was too great to overcome. At just 20 years old, Gauff will look to rebound in the upcoming tournaments, but this loss serves as a stark reminder of the challenges at the highest level of competition.For Badosa, this victory marks a significant milestone in her career. The Spaniard will now aim to carry her momentum into the semifinals, with her sights set on an even deeper run at Melbourne Park .","Coco Gauff's dreams of clinching another Grand Slam title came to an abrupt end as her forehand and serve faltered against Paula Badosa.

KOLKATA: The upcoming white-ball series between India and England brings the coaches on either side under the scanner. Both Gautam Gambhir and England counterpart Brendon McCullum , interestingly, are former coaches and players of the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) IPL franchise.After the Test series defeat Down Under, Gambhir's position as head coach is likely to be revaluated on the basis of India's Champions Trophy performance next month, so there is pressure on him. On the other hand, McCullum has made a new start, officially taking over as head coach across formats after having been in-charge of the Test team.McCullum's appointment comes after Matthew Mott was fired as white-ball coach on the back of two disappointing World Cup campaigns. England failed to advance to the semifinals of the ODI World Cup 2023 and just about made the top four in the T20 World Cup last year. The former New Zealand great's immediate task will be to inject some energy into the white-ball set-up.Also See: ICC Champions Trophy 2025 Gambhir got the India job more because of his success as a mentor in white-ball cricket, guiding the Kolkata Knight Riders to the IPL title. He was able to carry on the momentum during the T20I series against Sri Lanka, where India won all the three matches following the retirements of Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli from the shortest format. However, the former India opener is yet to secure a win in the 50-over format and the upcoming Champions Trophy is going to be important for his coaching future.McCullum will be carrying high expectations after he revolutionized the team's Test cricket with the 'Bazball' approach after becoming Test coach in July 2022. But he has never coached a white-ball international team, although he had brief stints as T20 coach for two franchise teams, with KKR being one of those.McCullum, for one, expressed respect for his India counterpart on Monday.""What I will say about Gautam Gambhir is that I've worked with him before. He's an outstanding leader. He's a really strong leader of men, and in the time that he's had in any sort of leadership positions he's held previously, he's been able to excel,"" McCullum told reporters here. ""He's only just sort of got underway with this team, but I have no doubt that he'll get the best out of the talent that he's got. And then we've (England) got to find a way to be able to counter that with our own style.""Also See: Champions Trophy Schedule 2025 Asked about coaching styles and philosophies, McCullum said, ""Everyone's approaches are very unique. From how I try and operate, it's probably less of a coach and more about trying to make sure that the environment is a happy and enjoyable one, where you guys feel as if they can push their talents and push themselves towards uncomfortable situations, knowing that there's still going to be that support and care there afterwards and be encouraged to go again go towards those.""Other coaches are very different. They like to run things in a quite structured, quite technical way. Other coaches are probably a bit more regimented in how they go about things, so I guess it's all fairly different,"" McCullum said.",Gautam Gambhir and Brendon McCullum are former coaches and players of the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) IPL franchise.

'I'm looking at building the franchise with Pant'

LSG owner Sanjiv Goenka talks to TOI on his expectations from the new captain....

Can Rishabh's price tag become a burden?

How important is it to have a culture of your own?

KOLKATA: Rishabh Pant's credentials as a leader are growing fast. The wicketkeeper-batter was on Monday named captain of Lucknow Super Giants ( LSG ), the IPL franchise that broke the bank for him at a mind-boggling Rs 27 cr. That at least two franchises were willing to go beyond the Rs 20 crore mark for him proves the kind of trust that Pant commands.""We would not have stopped at this amount,"" LSG owner Sanjiv Goenka says. Pant , however, wasn't surprised. ""Of course I was happy, but it was never about money,"" he told TOI in an exclusive interview.Leadership for me is more about looking after the players. How can you get the best out of them. How can you create an environment where they feel safe and stable so that they can give their 200%.Also See: ICC Champions Trophy 2025 I wasn't surprised, I have to say this (chuckles). But for me it wasn't about the money anyway. When I came to the auction, money wasn't in my thoughts, but I must say I was very happy with what I got. I wanted to be in a place where I could create the right environment with the help of the management. Create a franchise where people aspire to come, play and give their 100%.It's definitely a comfort zone as we have a lot of players who have experience in leadership in international cricket. You want to share that and it's always good to take the views of your seniors. A captain is as good as the team and everyone in the room is also thinking about the game. So, if you listen to everyone, keep everything in account and then make decisions, it is always good for the team. A good leader is always a good listener and that is something I would like to take forward.I've thought about it. I tried to tone myself down and I wanted to change a little, as people sometimes don't like it if I'm a little extroverted. With time you improve as an individual. Your decision-making changes. So, it's a mix of a lot of things. But after my car accident, I realized that there is no need to tone down. If I am excited about something, it means I care about it. Sometimes when you play cricket for a few years, your excitement goes down and you stop enjoying the game. You may be in a different position in your career, but that doesn't mean you need to change.I started playing cricket because I loved it. The thought process was to play for India and give my 200%. Now that I am blessed to be doing that, if I stop enjoying it means I am deviating from my goals. I promised myself that I am going to enjoy it more. There are a few people in the world who can do what they like and make money out of it, and why not. I see it as an opportunity. Coming to a new franchise is an opportunity.Also See: Champions Trophy 2025 Schedule I joined when I was 17-18, so it was a very emotional decision. But we are professionals, and this is what we do. I'm not thinking much about that now. Once the decision was made, I knew it would be a very difficult one. I knew I would feel bad but I can't be living in the past. I'd like to move on and get better. Now it's a different family for me and I'll look to build more relationships with the people here.The price tag (for Pant) was only relevant till the time the auction didn't happen. Thereafter, he is the leader. It's not about the tag. It's about his leadership, his performance, how he motivates players, how he strategizes. So, I haven't thought about the price tag for a moment after the auction got over. Everyone has got the same Rs 120 crore purse and it's your discretion on how you distribute it. Rishabh deserves that price. If the bidding had gone on and it was Rs 28 crore, I still would have gone for him as he was fundamental to all our plans. It's about the skills he brings. I'm looking at it for the next 10-12 years. He is 27 and will play till 40. I'm looking at building the franchise with him. The more I see him, the more I'm convinced he is the perfect choice for us.It's important for everyone to feel comfortable and happy. That is what we want to create. Also, we want to have an atmosphere of never-say-die attitude. These are the things that I feel Rishabh embodies. No owner is looking to win all the matches. As long as the win ratio is more than losses, it is good for us.","Rishabh Pant was on Monday named captain of Lucknow Super Giants.
