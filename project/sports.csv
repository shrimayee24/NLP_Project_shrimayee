'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

NEW DELHI: Shreyas Iyer played a crucial role in India's triumph over England in the first ODI in Nagpur, delivering a match-winning 59 off 36 balls. However, in a surprising revelation during the post-match interview, Iyer disclosed that he was initially not part of India's playing XI for the game.India had already been forced into a change, with star batter Virat Kohli ruled out due to a swollen right knee. Yashasvi Jaiswal , who had yet to make his ODI debut, was handed his first cap.While many assumed Jaiswal was a direct replacement for Kohli, Iyer’s revelation suggested that Jaiswal was already in the team’s plans, with Iyer originally set to start the series on the bench.""So, funny story,"" Iyer shared.""I was watching a movie last night, thinking I could extend my night, but then I got a call from the skipper saying that I might play because Virat has got a swollen knee. And then I hurried back to my room and went off to sleep straight away.""When asked about Jaiswal being included ahead of him in the original XI, Iyer tactfully sidestepped any controversy.""You know what you want me to say, but I'm going to keep it low-key and cherish this moment, the victory today,"" he added.Jaiswal’s inclusion prompted a reshuffle in India’s top order. Regular openers Rohit Sharma and Shubman Gill were split, with Gill moving down to No. 3. Had Kohli been available, it remains uncertain who would have occupied the crucial No. 3 slot.Iyer has been India's preferred No. 4 batter in ODIs in recent years and played a key role in their run to the 2023 World Cup final.He scored 468 runs in the tournament at an impressive average of 66.25, including two centuries—one of them a dominant 70-ball 105 in the semi-final against New Zealand. His strike rate of 113.24 was the highest among India's middle-order batters.With the Champions Trophy set to begin on February 19, this ODI series against England represents India's final opportunity to fine-tune their combination. Jaiswal’s inclusion could signal that India wants him ready as a backup opener in case of injuries, while Gill’s stint in the middle order might be a trial run for a potential role adjustment.","Shreyas Iyer reveals he was initially not part of India's playing XI for the game.

What Jimmy Butler brings to the Golden State Warriors

fans will have to wait a little longer to seein action. After being traded from the Miami Heat , Butler will most likely not be available for Thursday’s game against the Los Angeles Lakers at Crypto.com Arena. The six-time All-Star is expected to join the team when they travel to Chicago for Saturday’s matchup against the Bulls.Although the Golden State Warriors have yet to officially announce the trade, it is expected to be finalized by Thursday. Given the timing, Jimmy Butler won’t be able to suit up against the Lakers.Adding to the situation, Butler has played just five games since December 20 due to team suspensions and hasn’t stepped on the court since January 21. As a result, he will likely need time to get back into full game shape before making his Warriors debut. However, according to NBA insider Chris Haynes, Butler assured the Heat before the trade that he is “in shape” and “healthy.”With Jimmy Butler unavailable, Golden State will enter Thursday’s contest with two players on the injury report. Jonathan Kuminga is ruled out with an ankle injury, while Moses Moody is listed as day-to-day with a back issue.Despite missing Butler for this game, the Golden State Warriors will rely on their current core, led by Stephen Curry, who has averaged 18.9 points and 3.5 three-pointers per game over the last 20 contests. Other key contributors such as Trayce Jackson-Davis and Buddy Hield will also be expected to step up.When Butler finally takes the floor, his impact could be significant. He could provide the defensive intensity and playmaking the Warriors need to strengthen their playoff push. With Golden State currently sitting at a .500 record (25-25), Butler’s arrival comes at a crucial time.Also read: Will Luka Doncic play his debut match against the Golden State Warriors?

Andy Reid has provided an important update on wide receiver Rashee Rice's status

The Kansas City Chiefs are heading into Super Bowl LIX against the Philadelphia Eagles with a relatively healthy roster. Wide receiver Skyy Moore, who had been dealing with an abdomen injury, fully participated in recent practices and is expected to play.Andy Reid shared an optimistic update on Rashee Rice's recovery from knee surgery during a press conference on Wednesday. Rice, who underwent a procedure in October to repair the LCL in his right knee, is reportedly ""doing well"" as he progresses in his rehab. Reid expressed confidence that the receiver’s recovery is a positive sign for the upcoming season, adding that it's encouraging for the team to see his improvement.""It's a good sign for next year,""Reid added, signaling optimism about Rice's long-term outlook. Rashee Rice, a key early-season target for Patrick Mahomes with 288 yards and two touchdowns, suffered a season-ending knee injury in Week 4. As he remains on injured reserve, the Chiefs signed veteran DeAndre Hopkins to fill the gap in their receiving corps for the rest of the season.Rice, the Kansas City Chiefs' promising wide receiver, has been progressing well in his recovery after undergoing surgery to repair a torn LCL in his right knee and address a hamstring tendon injury. Despite the setback, his recovery is reportedly on track, adhering to the estimated four-month timeline. Rice's injury occurred in Week 4 of the 2024 season, causing him to miss the remainder of the year.""I feel terrible for Rashee. We will hope for the best,""Reid said when Rice initially went down. With Rice expected to be back at full strength next season, the Chiefs face intriguing decisions at wide receiver. Veterans DeAndre Hopkins and Marquise ""Hollywood"" Brown are both pending free agents, and rookie Xavier Worthy will enter his second season.Marquise ""Hollywood"" Brown signed with the Chiefs on a one-year, $11 million contract in March 2024, bringing speed and playmaking ability to their deep passing game. After recovering from an injury, he's expected to make a significant impact. The Chiefs also added Xavier Worthy in the first round of the 2024 NFL Draft, known for his elite speed and deep-threat potential, further enhancing their offense.A healthy Rice could allow Kansas City to be more strategic in free agency and the draft, potentially avoiding a major splash to reinforce the position. This approach would enable the team to allocate resources to other areas of need while maintaining a strong receiving corps.Also Read: Will Taylor Swift still attend the Super Bowl with Blake Lively, as she has been once again dragged into the Justin Baldoni drama Looking ahead to 2025, the Chiefs’ offense is poised to be even more dangerous. With the combination of Hopkins' experience, Brown's speed, Worthy's deep-threat ability, and Rice's potential return, Patrick Mahomes will have a diverse and dynamic set of weapons at his disposal. The depth and versatility of the receiving corps are expected to make the Chiefs' offense one of the most formidable in the league in 2025.","Andy Reid shared an optimistic update on wide receiver Rashee Rice's recovery from knee surgery.

India sweat over Virat Kohli's fitness ahead of Champions Trophy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/england-tour-of-india-2025/india-sweat-over-virat-kohlis-fitness-ahead-of-champions-trophy/articleshow/117998148.cms,"Star batter misses first ODI with sore knee

NAGPUR: For 1,130 days, Virat Kohli had been immune to the wear and tear which sidelines even the toughest athletes. Until Thursday. At Jamtha, as India geared up for the first ODI against England, Kohli walked in with his right knee heavily strapped.He moved with a slightly lower intensity, hobbled a bit with physio Kamlesh Jain keeping a close watch on his movements. But it didn't seem the injury will keep him out.Which is why even when Yashasvi Jaiswal was handed the India cap, along with Harshit Rana, no one thought it would come at the expense of an injured Kohli. It did though.It wasn't until Rohit Sharma confirmed Kohli's absence at the toss that the reality sank in - India's batting mainstay had been rested. The injury may not have seemed serious at first, but with the Champions Trophy on the horizon, his fitness is now a concern.According to sources in the team's support staff, the decision to rest Kohli was taken late on Wednesday night. ""His right knee was fine during practice, but once we got back to the hotel, it swelled up,"" a team insider told TOI. ""It doesn't seem that bad though. He will play the Cuttack ODI in all likelihood,"" he added.The 36-year-old hasn't yet been taken for scans. It will be interesting to see whether Kohli will leave for Bengaluru for a quick check-up at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) or accompany the team to Cuttack for the next game.It was a rare moment of vulnerability for a cricketer whose supreme fitness has been his armour for 17 years.The last time Kohli missed a game due to injury was in 2022, when an upper back spasm kept him out of a Test against South Africa. Before that, in 2021, a stiff back saw him sidelined for a warm-up match against Select County XI. And in 2017, he sat out the fourth Test against Australia after a valiant attempt to stop a boundary in Ranchi left him nursing a right shoulder injury.India are already sweating over the fitness of pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah who suffered back spasms during the final Test of India's Australia tour last month. He has since been out of action with captain Rohit Sharma revealing the team is awaiting the result of a scan following which a call will be taken whether the pacer will feature in the third ODI of the England series.","Virat Kohli misses India's first ODI against England with a sore knee.

Brett Favre believes he was staged unfairly by ESPN and NFL Films

Mark Gastineau was the one to challenge Brett Favre in December 2023 regarding Michael Strahan's sack of Green Bay Packers legend. In the last game of the 2001 season, Favre, New York Giants legend, fell on the field and then was tackled by Strahan to set a record that was later tied by T.J. Watt. Gastineau charged Favre with taking a dive.Mark Gastineau met Favre at a memorabilia event last year, saying that Favre had ""hurt"" him and that he was going to ""take my sack back"" in a heated exchange. The confrontation was featured in ESPN 's 30 for 30, ""New York Sack Exchange;"" not coincidentally, Favre said he believes the meeting had been planned by ""ESPN and/or NFL Films .""Brett Favre, a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame and quarterback, finds himself entangled in a controversy which, according to him, was a well-thought-out plan. Favre has been defending an exchange with former Jets pass rusher Mark Gastineau over the all-time single-season sack record which, according to him, was staged unfairly by ESPN and NFL Films.Gastineau stood up against Favre for sliding on the final play of the 2001 season where Michael Strahan got his record-breaking 22.5th sack. However, in Favre's view, the entire situation was manipulated to create drama. ""I feel like I was set up,"" the Green Bay Packers legend said. ""I was under the impression that it was just a conversation, not an ambush.”Gastineau, who previously held the NFL record for two decades, expressed frustration over a significant flaw in the sport's history. It shouldn't have happened that way,"" Gastineau reportedly told Favre. Favre, however, stands by his actions, insisting that his play wasn't premeditated. ""I wasn't thinking about records- I was thinking about getting out of there in one piece,"" he explained.The former NFL legend has maintained a close friendship with Donald Trump, frequently attending rallies and playing golf together, and expressed joy upon Trump's return to power. ""I just want to congratulate President @realDonaldTrump on taking office today,"" Favre posted to Twitter on January 20. ""He's been a good friend. ""And I think he will help mend fences and turn the country around - not just for some people, but everyone. God bless America.”Also Read: “What a joke letting that guy go”: Commanders RB Austin Ekeler thrashed the Giants for their baffling decision of letting Saquon Barkley go The debate over Strahan's record and Favre's portrayal of the encounter has resurfaced, with some fans questioning its legitimacy.

Myles Garrett Calls Eagles A ‘Hell Of A Destination’ Post Trade Request

It was reported a few days ago, that Cleveland Browns General Manager Andrew Berry is keen on retaining defensive end Myles Garrett for the team. Although Garrett's 2024 season wasn’t as great as his 2023 performance because of the Browns' poor record, he tied his 2023 sack total with 14 and achieved a career-high of 22 tackles for loss. So fans have been speculating over his decision for next season and Garrett rocked NFL when openly requested a trade. And now he has shared his thoughts about the Eagles being his next team.During Radio Row, Garrett spoke with Zach Gelb and said, ""I'm not going to stay too attached to one team.” When asked about joining the Eagles he said, ""I know my fate isn't really in my hands, but it would be a hell of a destination.""Another team Garrett mentioned this week was the Washington Commanders . He told sports journalist Brice Butler that he could ""fill the role"" of a pass rusher for the team.Garrett's pass-rushing skills earned him a top spot among NFL edge rushers, but his performance as a run defender also stood out, ranking 11th in the league.In the recent past, Garrett has shared his thoughts about his future. ""I want to stay loyal to a team that showed loyalty to me and faith in me by drafting me. But we have to do, at the end of the day, what's best for us. So, if we have that alignment where this is something that is still possible in the near future -- winning, going deep in the playoffs, putting a great defense out there ... I think that would really keep my mind at rest and keep me settled,” he explained.Post Garrett’s request to be traded, Pro Bowl cornerback Denzel Ward opened up and hinted at uncertainties about his commitment to the Browns. In a conversation with Cleveland.com, Ward reiterated his intention to stay in Cleveland while acknowledging the challenges.""I want to be in Cleveland,"" Ward said. ""I want to win. I’m definitely keeping an eye on what Myles has going on and what he's doing. I’m just interested in seeing how everything plays out. Like I said, I want to play with Myles Garrett, and we’ve just got to wait and see.""","Myles Garrett calls Eagles a 'Hell Of A Destination' Post Trade Request.

Why did Juan Soto choose the New York Mets over the Yankees?

Biggest Questions surrounding 2025 Yankees | Pinstripe Post 41

“If I were a Yankee fan, what I would be thinking is, Juan Soto rejected us for the Mets. The Yankees have not had a bad season for over 30 years, right? To go to a team that has finished first six times in their history and has never made the playoffs three years in a row, there was something either lacking in the Yankees in his view or something so enticing in the Mets’ whole setup that it feels like it wasn't just about money at the end.”

“If I were a Yankee fan, that’s what I’d be looking at and saying, for the first time in king of the history of the two teams being together, but certainly over the last 30 years, or maybe even the last 50 years, the Steinbrenner era since the early 1970s, a player of stature said, 'I’d rather play there than here. And that is really interesting to me, and it questions the dynamic of where we are in New York baseball in 2025 and moving forward.”

While talking about Juan Soto’s inclination toward the Mets over the Yankees, Sherman said-From a fan’s point of view, Sherman clearly elaborated on the factor that why he would have played from the Yankees’ end.

During the introductory press conference, Soto spoke about his excitement with respect to joining the Mets. He said-Soto bagged the biggest contract with the New York Mets in the history of professional sports. Reportedly, Juan Soto can opt out after the 2029 season, but if the Mets go ahead with elevating his annual salary by $4 million, the grand total would stand at around $805 million.

The Washington Wizards are Expected to Retain Khris Middleton

The Milwaukee Bucks entered the trade market by sending away one of their best players Khris Middleton to the Washington Wizards . In return, the Bucks have acquired Kyle Kuzma who played a key role in helping the Los Angeles Lakers win the 2020 NBA Finals. Right as Middleton was traded, many expected the Wizards to cut him loose. However, it seems like Washington has other plans.Continue reading to learn more about the Washington Wizards’ plans for Khris Middleton.Several reports around the league suggest that the Wizards are looking to retain Khris Middleton. Middleton will make $65 million in salary over the next two years and the Wizards seem to be okay with that. This might seem like a bad idea since the soon-to-be 34-year-old star is prone to injuries. However, beneath all the wear and tear lies an NBA Champion who knows what it takes to win in this league.The Wizards can use that knowledge by retaining Middleton on a roster full of young talent. Middleton’s veteran presence and experience will help change the culture in Washington and might even help the team find its winning ways again. Before being traded, Khris Middleton was averaging 12.6 points, 3.7 rebounds, and 4.4 assists per game.He won’t be the same star that he was on the Bucks. But, if he stays, Middleton will have the chance to contribute to the beginning of a winning culture in Washington. The Wizards have failed to make the playoffs since the 2020/21 season. However, their poor performance has helped the team get its hands on some exciting prospects.If the Wizards develop their talent well and use Middleton as an example to all the young players, they might just turn things around within a couple of years. But, Middleton might not be around to witness the team’s ascension as he only has two years left on his current contract.ALSO READ: Giannis Antetokounmpo gives teary farewell to Khris Middleton following his trade to Washington Wizards: “There's been so many moments together"" Middleton is already a hero to everyone in Milwaukee. For the good part of a decade, he has been the Bucks’ second-most important player behind Giannis Antetokounmpo . If it wasn’t for Khris Middleton, the Bucks wouldn’t have been able to win the 2021 NBA Finals either. Now, it is time for a new chapter in his career. It’ll be interesting to see what kind of impact Middleton can have on shaping the future of the Washington Wizards.","The Washington Wizards are expected to retain Khris Middleton.

He is averaging 7.2 points per game across 20 appearances this season and joins his third team in four years.For Atlanta, this trade adds younger pieces to their roster as they remain in contention for a play-in spot.

What’s in store for Durant and the Phoenix Suns ahead of the NBA Trade Deadline?

The NBA trade deadline is fast approaching, and one of the biggest unanswered questions is whether the. With teams making significant moves—including the Golden State Warriors landing Jimmy Butler from the Miami Heat—Durant’s future remains a hot topic.A trade involving Durant once seemed like a real possibility, but as the deadline nears, all signs point to the Phoenix Suns keeping their star forward. According to NBA insider Chris Haynes, Phoenix has ""always prepared to venture into the second half of the season with the core roster in place."" That includes both Durant and Bradley Beal, who has also been mentioned in trade rumors.Despite sitting 10th in the Western Conference, the Suns appear committed to seeing how far they can go with their current lineup. Durant is still one of the league’s top performers, averaging 26.9 points, 6.1 rebounds, and 4.2 assists per game while shooting 52.4% from the field. His presence alone keeps Phoenix in the playoff conversation, making it unlikely they would move him unless an overwhelming offer came through.One of the most intriguing possibilities was a reunion between Kevin Durant and the Warriors, the team where he won two championships. According to ESPN’s Shams Charania, Golden State was ""legitimately calling about every All-Star player"" leading up to the deadline, including Durant.However, a return to the Bay Area did not seem appealing to the 15-time All-Star. Marc Stein reported thatReports indicated that he was not interested in reuniting with Stephen Curry , Draymond Green, and head coach Steve Kerr.ESPN’s Brian Windhorst later revealed that Kevin played a direct role in stopping a proposed blockbuster trade. The deal would have sent him back to the Warriors, Butler to the Phoenix Suns, and Andrew Wiggins to the Heat. Ultimately, Durant declined to approve the move, keeping him in Phoenix.After Golden State changed its priorities, the franchise traded Wiggins to Miami in order to get Butler. Additionally, Butler committed to a two-year contract deal with the Warriors, guaranteeing his continued presence after this season.Given that the deadline is only a few hours away, Kevin appears to be staying put—at least for the time being. The Suns have firmly decided to hold onto their core group in the hopes that their roster will improve things.

Chicago Bears Owner Virginia McCaskey Dies; What Was Her Role In The Organization?

Chicago Bears matriarch Virginia McCaskey, who was the principal owner of the team has passed away at the age of 102. In 1983, McCaskey inherited the Chicago Bears from her father, George Halas who was one of the founders of the NFL McCaskey’s family announced through the team that she died Thursday.“While we are sad, we are comforted knowing Virginia Halas McCaskey lived a long, full, faith-filled life and is now with the love of her life on earth,” the family said. “She guided the Bears for four decades and based every business decision on what was best for Bears players, coaches, staff and fans.”NFL columnist Judy Battista writes in McCaskey’s obituary that the late McCaskey still went to every Bears game and often agonized over the results. During her time, the Bears won a Super Bowl in 1986 and lost a second 21 years later. In 2014, her son, George, fired the coach and general manager following a dismal season and famously said his mother was ""pissed off.”Also Read: Kansas City Chiefs guard Trey Smith may soon leave Chiefs after Super Bowl LIX McCaskey had 11 children and preferred to keep a low profile, despite controlling 80 per cent of the team.

In a 2016 interview, McCaskey predicted that the team will remain in the family's hands ""until the second coming.""“Virginia Halas McCaskey, the matriarch of the Chicago Bears and daughter of George Halas, the founder of the NFL, leaves a legacy of class, dignity, and humanity,” NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said in a statement. “Faith, family, and football — in that order — were her north stars and she lived by the simple adage to always ‘do the right thing.’ The Bears that her father started meant the world to her, and he would be proud of the way she continued the family business with such dedication and passion.

Paolo Banchero’s impact on the Orlando Magic’s lineup

How the Denver Nuggets match up against the Orlando magic

Thewill face the Denver Nuggets on February 6, but questions linger about the availability of one of their key players,. With the Magic dealing with multiple injuries, Banchero’s status could significantly impact their chances against the Western Conference contenders. Paolo Banchero is currently listed on the Magic’s injury report, raising concerns about his availability for the game at Ball Arena. The 21-year-old forward has been a vital part of Orlando’s rotation, averaging 13.1 points, 4.2 rebounds, and 3.1 assists over the last 20 games. His ability to create offense and contribute across multiple categories makes him an essential piece for the Magic.If Banchero is unable to play, the Magic will need to adjust their lineup and offensive game plan. With Moritz Wagner already ruled out for the season due to a knee injury, Orlando's frontcourt depth is already being tested. Wendell Carter Jr. and Goga Bitadze might need to step up in the paint, while Franz Wagner, the team's top scorer with 25.1 points per game, will probably be responsible for more of the offensive load. Jalen Suggs , who is dealing with a quadriceps injury, is listed as day-to-day. If both Banchero and Suggs are sidelined, the Magic could struggle against a Nuggets team that features two-time MVP Nikola Jokić and a high-powered offense averaging 121 points per game.Denver, currently 32-19, has four players on its injury report, including Russell Westbrook (hamstring) and Peyton Watson (knee). Despite these absences, the Nuggets remain strong with Jokić leading the charge, averaging 23.6 points, 10.7 rebounds, and 9.8 assists in the last 20 games. Jamal Murray and Michael Porter Jr. also provide scoring depth, which could create matchup problems for an injury-riddled Magic squad.Also read: Will Nikola Jokic play tonight against the Orlando Magic?

Jayden Daniels: The Rookie Sensation Who Reshaped Washington's Future



The notion that a single rookie quarterback can single-handedly turn around an NFL franchise is often more fantasy than reality. A true transformation requires an entire team effort, strategic coaching, and a supportive front office. Yet, in the case of the 2024 Washington Commanders , Jayden Daniels made an undeniable case that one exceptional young talent can redefine a franchise’s fortunes.Jayden Daniels’ electrifying performance in his debut season is precisely why NFL teams continue to believe that drafting the right quarterback can change everything. His combination of passing precision and rushing dynamism made him one of the most exciting players to watch in 2024. By the season’s conclusion, his achievements were nothing short of historic. With 3,568 passing yards, 25 touchdowns, and only nine interceptions, Daniels exhibited the poise and decision-making of a seasoned veteran. But what set him apart was his ability to make plays with his legs, rushing for 891 yards—an all-time rookie quarterback record—along with six touchdowns.Unsurprisingly, Daniels was crowned the NFL’s 2024 Offensive Rookie of the Year , receiving 49 of 50 first-place votes. His dominance in the voting left little doubt about his impact, as he finished far ahead of his closest competitors—Raiders tight end Brock Bowers and Broncos quarterback Bo Nix.“In my opinion, he’s had the best rookie year of all time,” remarked Houston Texans quarterback C.J. Stroud, who had himself set a high standard for rookie quarterbacks the year prior. Such praise from a fellow rising star only underscores Daniels’ remarkable achievement.Daniels’ heroics were not confined to the regular season. His defining moment came in Week 8 when he connected on a stunning Hail Mary to secure an 18-15 victory over the Chicago Bears. That moment was later awarded the 2024-25 NFL Play of the Year and solidified Daniels’ reputation as a game-changer.When the Commanders entered the playoffs, Daniels showed rare composure for a rookie. He led Washington to a thrilling wild-card victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, marking the team’s first postseason win in nearly two decades. The following week, he stunned the NFL world by guiding the Commanders past the No. 1-seeded Detroit Lions in an NFC Divisional Round upset. While Washington fell short in the NFC Championship against the Philadelphia Eagles, Daniels had already cemented his place in history.Daniels’ name now stands among legends who have won the Offensive Rookie of the Year award, including Franco Harris, Barry Sanders, and Randy Moss. Yet, his case may be one of the strongest for the greatest rookie season ever. His 69% completion rate was a new benchmark for qualified NFL rookies, and his dual-threat ability was reminiscent of the game’s most elite playmakers.Also Read: Saquon Barkley's impressive performance at 2,000 yards earned him the 2024 AP NFL Offensive Player of the Year award As the new face of the Washington Commanders, Jayden Daniels has set a foundation for what could be an illustrious career.

"6,000 runs and 600 wickets: Ravindra Jadeja joins elite club",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/england-tour-of-india-2025/6000-runs-and-600-wickets-ravindra-jadeja-joins-elite-club/articleshow/117999273.cms,"NAGPUR: Joe Root and Steve Smith - their names define an era, their wickets are prized possessions for any bowler. But for Ravindra Jadeja , they have simply been regular scalps in his remarkable career. Dismiss them once, and it's a moment to cherish. Dismiss them 23 times, and you own them. Few bowlers can claim to have repeatedly outfoxed two of the greatest batters of their generation, but Jadeja has done it with a mix of cunning, control, and sheer mastery over his craft.So when Rohit Sharma tossed the ball to his veteran spinner on Thursday, Root - despite his comfort against Kuldeep Yadav - knew the real battle had just begun. The partnership between Root and England captain Jos Buttler was brewing into something dangerous, threatening to take England deep into the innings. But Jadeja sensed the moment. He sent down a skiddy, darting delivery at over 100 kmph, one that hurried onto Root's pads before he could react. The appeal was loud, the umpire's finger went up, and Root stood there in disbelief. The review was a mere formality - the damage was done. Jadeja had trapped his prey for the 12th time.With that, Ravindra Jadeja marched into an elite club, becoming only the fifth Indian to claim 600 international wickets . The great Anil Kumble , Kapil Dev, Harbhajan Singh, and R Ashwin now have company - Jadeja has sealed his name among India's finest.It wasn't just the milestone that made Thursday special. Jadeja's terrific 3/26 in 9 overs put the brakes on England's charge at crucial moments. When England sought acceleration in the middle overs, he suffocated them with his relentless accuracy. When Jacob Bethell, fresh off a hard-fought fifty, looked to change gears, Jadeja once again delivered - this time with another skidding arm-ball that shattered England's hopes of a late flourish.The left-armer's recent red-hot form was on full display. Coming off a sensational 10-wicket haul for Saurashtra in the Ranji Trophy, he carried that rhythm into this ODI, reminding the world why he is an automatic selection in any Indian XI.Jadeja also etched his name into the record books as the highest wicket-taker in India-England ODIs played in India, surpassing James Anderson (40 wickets) and leaving behind Andrew Flintoff (37). And with 6,000 international runs to complement his 600 wickets, Jadeja now stands alone - a one-of-a-kind Indian spinner.As India eyes the Champions Trophy , a fit, firing, and fierce Jadeja could be the MVP for India.","Ravindra Jadeja becomes only the fifth Indian to claim 600 international wickets.

SA20 showcasing perfect balance between bat and ball: Vernon Philander

There is something about Sunrisers Eastern Cape and the SA20 playoffs . In 2023, they won the semi-final and the final. In 2024, they won Qualifier 1 and the final. Now, this year, they won the Eliminator, the Qualifier 2 and have booked a spot in the final. That is an unbelievable 6-0 record in the playoffs.Their latest conquest, in the second qualifier, came against Paarl Royals by eight wickets on Thursday at Centurion in Johannesburg. In the final awaits MI Cape Town , at the Wanderers, on Saturday.At the other end of this superlative record sit the Paarl Royals. For the third straight season, they've found themselves in the playoffs and for the third straight season they've not reached the finals.After braving the severe sun and baking heat in Centurion, SEC chased down the 176-run target with quite some ease. Skipper Aiden Markram celebrated the moment, achieved with a cracking cover drive, with a jump and an air punch but the job was done before he arrived. Tony de Zorzi (78 from 49 balls) and Jordan Hermann (69* from 48 balls) put the game well and truly past the Royals' reach of defending. As they put together 111 runs - the highest second-wicket stand for the franchise in SA20 history - all Markram had to do upon arrival was stay steady at the other end.De Zorzi slammed 11 fours and two sixes, earning himself a roaring reception as he walked back to the pavilion and raised his bat. Fittingly, the locals applauded the 27-year-old who came through the U-17 and U-19 ranks at Gauteng, the province under which Johannesburg resides.Even as his opening partner David Bedingham perished and Hermann started slowly, De Zorzi went about his business with aplomb. Soon enough, just when the required rate started to near 10 an over, Hermann joined in the act with four fours and four sixes of his own.In the first innings, Paarl Royals started poorly with Mitchell Owen once again unable to fill in for the giant Joe Root absence. He tried to attack Marco Jasen early, only to get an edge which was held comfortably behind the stumps.Lhuan dre-Pretroius (59 from 41) and Rubin Hermann (81 from 53) put together 99 runs for the second wicket. Andile Phehlukwayo (22 from 11) provided a late flourish but it wasn't enough for the Royals on the night - and for a third straight SA20 season.","Sunrisers Eastern Cape beat Paarl Royals by eight wickets in the SA20 playoffs.

SA20: Markram leads Sunrisers to victory as title defense stays alive

St George's Park Band keeps the spirit high in SA20

JOHANNESBURG: When Paarl Royals took on Sunrisers Eastern Cape at the Centurion in the SA20 on Thursday, it was a momentous occasion for the league. In its third edition now, with just one game to go, SA20 has done what South African cricket desperately wanted - sustenance. The T20 Global League and Mzansi Super League tried, and failed. SA20, with its six franchises, backed by Indian Premier League (IPL) team owners, has grown leaps and bounds.spoke to SA20 league commissioner and former Proteas skipper Graeme Smith on what he described as an ""emotional time.""""It's actually quite an emotional time. I can't believe we have our 100th game. If I think about all the work that went in the beginning to get up and running, and to attract six franchises, then to take it so quickly into Season 1, and we are sitting at the back end of Season 3,"" said Smith.""There's so many highlights for me: from hundreds to fivers to underdogs winning in the first two years. But the thing that stands out for me is the outstanding cricket. We've seen some of the world's best players, both in South Africa and internationally, playing in our country, which has been terrific. And then also the fans. Bringing fans in India is not an issue, but in South Africa, seeing our fans come back to the game and loving it so much has been exciting,"" he went on to elaborate.For SA20, the first step was getting a local broadcaster and they did so in the form of SuperSport - the largest in the country. Global broadcasters, such as Disney+ Hotstar and Jio in India, have also kept their faith in the South African T20 league's brand.The time slot, for the evening game, is 5:30pm local time (9pm IST). This year, the league has an Indian influence on the pitch - in the form of Dinesh Karthik with the Paarl Royals - and in the commentary box with Robin Uthappa.Smith denied that the SA20 has an over-reliance on India and its market.""The Indian market is the biggest cricket market in the world. It's silly. But, I wouldn't say (that) every decision we make is for the Indian market, because we've got full stadiums, we've got to attract eyeballs in South Africa. You want to attract commercial partners in the place that your league is happening as well.""But, you know, we've got global ambitions. And if you've got global ambitions, you want to grow around the world, and India is one of the key markets. We're very fortunate with the six IPL franchises. We're very fortunate with our relationship with Jio and Viacom and all the other partners that we've been able to attract. So I think South African cricket, since readmission back into sport, has always had a very special relationship with Indian fans, and they love South African cricketers. And we want to keep that,"" added Smith who played three seasons with Rajasthan Royals and one with the now defunct Pune Warriors India in the IPL.Another challenge for T20 leagues, especially in the current cricket climate, is finding a spot in a packed calendar. SA20 has taken place at the same time as the Big Bash League (BBL in Australia), Bangladesh Premier League (BPL) and the Super Smash (in New Zealand).The next season's window has already been announced - between December 26, 2025 and January 26, 2026 - right before the T20 World Cup. And Season 5 is due to run between January-February 2027.""We've had that challenge right from the beginning. When we (were) building, Big Bash existed. ILT20 was also ahead of us in their planning, we just really focused on making sure we do our job. Our franchises have been incredible in terms of how they've managed players, acquired their talent,"" stated the 44-year-old.""I think the fact that we've got a good base of South African cricketers really does help. We've seen that the level gets better and better every year for the South African cricketers. I thought this year might be a challenge for the international players, but having said that, we've got our best crop of international players.""What I'm excited about is that we're attracting the real quality international cricketers. We never wanted to build an exhibition style league. When you chat to the players after the game, they say, 'the cricket is hard, it's very competitive, and this is where they want to be'.""The season will conclude at the Wanderers in Johannesburg with Sunrisers Eastern Cape looking to complete a hat-trick of titles. Standing in their way will be MI Cape Town.This season has been significantly bowler friendly with the 200-run mark being breached just six times with MICT posting the biggest total at 222/3. All three of the biggest totals this season had come at the Centurion which was spin-friendly on Wednesday and two-paced on Thursday.Smith wishes there were more edge-of-the-seat games this season. ""It's been very competitive. I think home ground advantage has grown this year. I think the fan loyalty has amazed me this year, like when I've arrived in stadiums and seen, you know, the Orange Army (fans of Sunrisers) in PE (Port Elizabeth) and then I go to Durban or yellow in Joburg (Johannesburg) and blue, and it's actually surprised me how fast people have got behind their teams.""Almost in the India style where they're not even cheering the opposition's success. So that's been amazing. Yeah, we would have liked maybe one or two closer games in the season, but (theres' been) some outstanding performances this year.""With South Africa due to co-host the 2027 ODI World Cup alongside Zimbabwe and Namibia, Smith cited pitches as one aspect that he wishes to improve for the future with the current crop ""quite worn.""As far as the future of the SA20 is concerned, he stressed on the importance of monitoring the global T20 businesses with IPL franchises acquiring stakes in teams in England's The Hundred. Smith expressed optimism in the SA20 being ""the number one choice"" outside the IPL and the format getting bigger with T20 being included in the programme for the LA 2028 Olympics.","South African T20 league celebrates its 100th game on Thursday. Graeme Smith says it is an ""emotional time"" for the league. The league is backed by Indian Premier League (IPL) team owners.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

England have confirmed they will face Afghanistan in the Champions Trophy match scheduled for February 26 in Lahore, despite British politicians urging for a boycott.The England and Wales Cricket Board made this decision after discussions with the UK government, ICC, and England players, despite over 160 British politicians calling for the match to be cancelled.The boycott calls stemmed from the Taliban regime's ban on female sports participation since their return to power in 2021, which violates ICC regulations. However, the men's team is still permitted to compete.ECB chairman Richard Thompson said: ""We remain of the view that a coordinated international response by the cricketing community is the appropriate way forward, and will achieve more than any unilateral action by the ECB in boycotting this match.""He further added: ""We have also heard that for many ordinary Afghans, watching their cricket team is one of the few remaining sources of enjoyment. As such, we can confirm that we will play this fixture.""Afghanistan have shown significant improvement in limited-overs cricket, currently ranked eighth in ODI rankings, just below England who are seventh.The tournament will take place from February 19 to March 9 across Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates.

Will Rohit Sharma win another ICC trophy? Here's what the horoscope says

NEW DELHI: Former Australia captain Ricky Ponting believes the focus now shifts to Mohammed Shami as he returns from injury in India's ongoing limited-overs series against England. Shami, who last played for India, before the England series, in the ICC Men's Cricket World Cup final in November 2023, is seen as a crucial asset for the team ahead of the upcoming ICC Men's Champions Trophy ""My biggest concern about India when they came for Australia in the Test series was [Jasprit] Bumrah not having Shami there as a backup and him having to burden most of the load,"" Ponting said on The ICC Review.""And that's probably what happened, and might even have something to do with why he [Bumrah] got hurt. He probably ended up having to bowl a bit more in that series with Shami not being there.""So look, if Shami's fit, that's a positive.""Shami made his return in the third and fourth T20Is against England, putting up an impressive performance with figures of 3/25 in his latest outing.Former India head coach and cricketer Ravi Shastri emphasised the importance of managing Shami's workload in the upcoming ODI series against England.""It will be interesting to see if India play him out in all three, or they give him the first one and the third one, and then ease him into the Champions Trophy ,"" Shastri said.""But he'll be watched very closely because 10 overs is totally different to four overs, and then you're going to see how he pulls up in the field as well having bowled those 10 overs.""Shami's form and fitness will be crucial for India as they begin their ICC Men's Champions Trophy campaign against Bangladesh on February 20 in Dubai. With Bumrah already handling a significant workload, the return of a fully fit Shami could provide India with much-needed bowling depth and balance ahead of a crucial tournament.","Former Australia captain Ricky Ponting believes the focus now shifts to Mohammed Shami as he returns from injury.

Will Rohit Sharma win another ICC trophy? Here's what the horoscope says

NEW DELHI: India's star all-rounder Hardik Pandya is brimming with confidence. He is eager to step onto the field, send the ball soaring into the stands, and rattle the stumps with his fiery bowling. Known for turning games on their head, Hardik Pandya is all set for the highly anticipated ICC Champions Trophy in Pakistan and Dubai, starting from February 19.India will play all their ICC Champions Trophy matches at the Dubai International Stadium, beginning their campaign against Bangladesh on February 20.The much-awaited clash against arch-rivals Pakistan is set for February 23, followed by their final league-stage encounter against New Zealand on March 2.In an interview shared by the International Cricket Council (ICC) on Wednesday, Pandya reminisced about the electrifying 2022 T20 World Cup showdown between India and Pakistan in Melbourne - a match India won by four wickets.Having claimed three wickets in that game, the allrounder reflected on how he handled the immense pressure of the high-stakes encounter against Pakistan.""It is just about who handles pressure better. I don't play for Hardik Pandya; I play for the team. I play for India—that's the goal. Whether that means playing just two balls at the end or batting for 60 balls, the focus is on taking the game ball by ball and getting closer to victory. Let’s see who cracks under pressure,"" Pandya told in an interview posted by ICC.India began their T20 World Cup campaign against Pakistan, winning the toss and electing to field in front of a packed crowd at the iconic Melbourne Cricket Ground.""When I entered the field and saw the atmosphere—the kind of energy the fans and spectators were bringing—it was just amazing. I had to take a moment to absorb it. Even though I have played many games, it was overwhelming in a way that made me both excited and happy. The atmosphere for this match, especially since it was India vs. Pakistan, just took everything up a notch. This rivalry has existed for years. While we have intense competition on the field, there are also so many emotions involved. The engagement, the excitement—it's a clash that people remember and eagerly wait for.""My plan was very simple: to back my strengths and be smart about it. In the first two balls I bowled, I got a little too excited by the Australian bounce and the wicket. As a result, I bowled a couple of deliveries that turned out to be boundary balls in those conditions. When I came in for my second spell, we obviously needed wickets. I was aware that they were going to put the accelerator on and try to score boundaries to reach a decent total. That’s when I realized that sticking to good balls would be the key.""I have always been someone who relies on good length and lines—that is my strength. I definitely don’t have the variations or skill set of Jasprit Bumrah , but I do possess Hardik Pandya’s skill set. For me, bowling back-of-a-length deliveries has always been a strength. It's more about gamesmanship, awareness, and using my skills effectively.""I was aggressive—I wanted to take wickets. My mindset was: ‘If you want to hit me, hit me off a good ball.’ That approach helped me take those two wickets. Just before that, I had kept the mid-on and mid-wicket fielders up, but for that particular ball, I sent one fielder back because I sensed he was going to go after me. I knew where my deliveries were landing and where the most likely scoring areas were—especially mid-wicket. Taking those wickets was quite satisfying,"" Pandya, who dismissed Shadab Khan, Haider Ali and Mohammad Nawaz, said.India secured a thrilling four-wicket victory, driven by Virat Kohli 's masterful unbeaten 82 off 53 balls.","India's star all-rounder Hardik Pandya is brimming with confidence.

Rohit Sharma's batting in ODIs has been game changing: Shubman Gill

NEW DELHI: Former India cricketer and ex-head coach Ravi Shastri understands the significance of the intense rivalry between India and Pakistan in international cricket. He recently shared his thoughts on current head coach Gautam Gambhir ’s remarks ahead of their highly anticipated ICC Champions Trophy clash.India and Pakistan, both placed in Group A of the tournament, will face off on February 23 in Dubai. The two teams last met at the venue in an ICC event in 2021, where Pakistan secured a dominant 10-wicket victory.Gambhir recently stated that the Champions Trophy group-stage match against Pakistan holds the same importance as any other fixture in the tournament, emphasizing that all games carry equal value.Speaking on the latest edition of The ICC Review, Shastri acknowledged that he had expressed a similar sentiment during his tenure as head coach but hinted that there is more to it than meets the eye.“I was the coach for seven years. Whenever I was asked, I said the same thing (as Gambhir). But let me assure you, deep down, there's a lot more to that than you actually think, that's for the media,” Shastri said.“You have to say it. But deep down, you want to win that. Because if you don't, you'll be reminded of it until the next time you play against Pakistan.“People don't care what you have done in the past. They're not bothered about the last 10 games if you won eight or you won nine. But they'll remind you if you lose one, until the next time you play them.“It can be a taxi driver, it could be anyone on the street. What happened to India? The same question to Pakistan. What happened to Pakistan? So it always plays on your mind, so whether you like it or not, it's a different game. Different beasts altogether.”Shastri, however, believes that the throwback won’t be taking up much headspace for Indian players.“No, that won't play on their mind because that was a T20 game. This is a 50-over clash. It's totally different,"" Shastri said.“And it's a longer game which suits India more, because in T20 you can get upset. In 50-over cricket, if you've got experience and you've got depth in your batting and bowling departments and you know, it makes a massive, massive difference.“And when you look at India and Pakistan man to man, India is a far better side and far more experienced as well.”",Former India head coach Ravi Shastri understands the significance of the rivalry between India and Pakistan in international cricket.

NAGPUR: Always the talking point in cricket, Nagpur pitches haven’t been short of controversies. While the pitch was rated ‘poor’ by the ICC in 2015, the Test against Australia in 2023 also saw the visitors criticising the surface. For Thursday though, a fresh, hard surface has been rolled out for the first ODI between India and England.“It seems a 300+ wicket right now, with some help to the spinners in the second half. It looks grassy now, but it might be shaved off,” said a source from VCA.Indian vice-captain Shubman Gill reckoned the wicket will dry soon. “You can never really predict how the wicket is going to play. No instructions have been given by the Indian camp regarding the pitch. I haven't seen grass being shaved off the pitch. The wicket dries here soon, so they might have kept some grass so that the surface retains moisture,” he said while addressing the media.Only one Ranji Trophy match was played on the pitch between Vidarbha and Gujarat in November 2024.

NAGPUR: Pretty early in the day, under the scorching afternoon sun at Jamtha, India's young guns lit the spark that would soon turn into a fire. England had strutted in with intent, their openers tearing into the Indian attack. At 75 for no loss in the ninth over, they were in cruise mode, dictating the tempo, setting the stage for a formidable total. But in the space of two overs, the script was torn apart, and the game swung violently in India's favour. Two debutants - fresh, fearless, and hungry - struck together, setting the tone for what was to come all day. India smothered England by four wickets to start their Champions Trophy preparations on a high at VCA, Jamtha, on Thursday.A moment of hesitation for England put the first crack in their smooth start. Opener Phil Salt, electric till then, was caught in a moment of indecision, stranded mid-pitch as KL Rahul gleefully completed the run-out. Suddenly, Ben Duckett looked rattled, his mind clouded by his partner's departure. Rohit Sharma smelled blood. He tossed the ball to lanky Rana, and in just four deliveries, the game turned on its head.Rana banged it in short, and Duckett, still shaken, took the bait. A mistimed pull, the ball hung in the air, spiraling towards no man's land. But Yashasvi Jaiswal , stationed at mid-wicket, was willing. He turned, sprinted back with relentless determination, and then - defying gravity and England's hopes - flung himself into a full-stretch dive, plucking the ball inches above the turf. The catch sent a jolt of energy through the Indian camp. England, once smooth and assured, were now staggering. From 75 for none, they were 77 for 3 in a blink.From there, India never let go. What had looked like a batting paradise, promising a 300-plus spectacle, turned into a graveyard for England's hopes. The Indian attack, led by Ravindra Jadeja 's masterful spell, ensured England's power-hitters never found their rhythm. He trapped Joe Root in the 19th over when the comeback man was rebuilding the innings with skipper Jos Buttler . The boundaries dried up soon - For 45 deliveries, they couldn't muster a single one with Indian spinners ruling the middle part of the innings. The visitors were eventually bundled out for a modest 248 - far below what they had initially threatened. While Rana and Jadeja picked three wickets apiece, Mohd Shami, Axar Patel and Kuldeep Yadav got one each.Later, India, calm and composed, swatted away England hopes of a collapse as they chased down the target with 68 balls to spare. Even as both openers fell cheaply, there was never a stutter. Shubman Gill, all elegance and poise, and Shreyas Iyer , brimming with intent, stitched together a 94-run partnership that extinguished England's last hopes.Iyer, aggressive yet precise, used the crease masterfully, pushing back to counter pace and driving with supreme confidence. His 36-ball 59 - laced with nine crisp boundaries and two towering sixes - ensured the chase never veered off track.Gill, meanwhile, was in his own sublime world. His wrists worked beautifully, carving boundaries at will, his short-arm pulls and delicate jabs were a delight. With 14 boundaries in his 96-ball 87, he dictated terms, guiding India ever closer to a win.Then there was Axar, sent ahead of KL Rahul in a tactical move, proving why the management had backed him. He was composed, assured, and fluent, stroking his way to a well-crafted half-century. With India already in cruise control, his knock was the finishing touch on an already near-perfect performance.
