NEW DELHI: In Chennai Super Kings' commanding 78-run victory over Sunrisers Hyderabad, Tushar Deshpande's sensational bowling performance during the powerplay proved to be the game-changer. Ruturaj Gaikwad, the skipper, recognized Deshpande's pivotal role in shifting the momentum back in their favour, a momentum that had been elusive throughout the season.Deshpande's wholehearted effort reflected in his figures of 4/27 off three overs. Particularly impactful were his three wickets during the powerplay, which dismantled the formidable Sunrisers Hyderabad batting order, led by Travis Head.In terms of individual performances for IPL 2024 Purple Cap list, Mustafizur Rahman's exceptional bowling performance saw him claim two wickets, elevating him to the second position in the IPL Purple Cap List. Rahman now has 14 wickets in 8 innings, tying with Purple Cap leader Jasprit Bumrah of Mumbai Indians, who has taken 14 wickets in 9 innings. However, Bumrah retains the top spot due to his superior economy and average.Also See:Harshal Patel of Punjab Kings follows closely behind in third place in the Purple Cap race, also with 14 wickets in 9 innings, but his economy and average are not as impressive as Bumrah and Rahman's. Matheesha Pathirana of CSK also had a noteworthy performance in the match, claiming two wickets, bringing his total to 13 wickets in 6 innings, securing him the fourth spot on the purple cap list. T Natarajan is in fifth place, having taken 13 wickets in 7 innings, including the crucial dismissal of Ruturaj Gaikwad for 98.In the upcoming match between Mumbai Indians and Lucknow Super Giants, Jasprit Bumrah's track record against key LSG batsmen is notable. He has dismissed K.L. Rahul, Nicholas Pooran, and Devdutt Padikkal twice each in previous encounters. This statistic adds an interesting dimension to the contest between Bumrah and the LSG batting lineup.","The IPL Purple Cap 2024 will be the largest in the history of the Indian Premier League. The cap will be worth an estimated $1.2 billion. It is expected to be the most expensive cap in the league's history. It will also be the biggest in the world, overtaking the $2.1 billion cap set by the World Bank.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109681945,imgsize-59894,width-400,resizemode-4/109681945.jpg"

NEW DELHI: In the latest IPL showdown, Chennai Super Kings dominated Sunrisers Hyderabad, with Skipper Ruturaj Gaikwad leading the charge with a stellar 98 runs. Gaikwad's aggressive innings, supported by contributions from Daryl Mitchell and Shivam Dube, propelled CSK to a formidable total of 212 for three after being invited to bat.CSK's victory was further sealed by a clinical bowling performance, spearheaded by Tushar Deshpande, who bagged four crucial wickets for 27 runs in his three overs.SRH's cautious batting strategy failed to counter Deshpande's early breakthroughs and the subsequent pressure applied during the middle overs. As a result, they stumbled to a disappointing total of 134 all out in 18.5 overs.In the 46th match of IPL 2024, Ruturaj Gaikwad narrowly missed out on a century, falling just two runs short. However, his impactful innings not only secured a crucial victory but also propelled him up the Orange Cap leader board. With a total of 447 runs from 9 innings, Gaikwad currently sits in second place, trailing only behind Virat Kohli of RCB, who continues to exhibit exceptional form with the bat.Speaking of Kohli, he further solidified his position at the top of the Orange Cap race by adding another half-century to his impressive tally, becoming the first player to breach the 500-run mark this season. His total of 500 runs maintains his lead in the IPL 2024 Orange Cap race.Behind Kohli and Gaikwad, Sai Sudharsan occupies the third position on the highest run-scorers list, with a total of 418 runs in 10 innings, courtesy of another half-century performance against RCB. Following Sudarshan is DC's captain Rishabh Pant, who has accumulated 398 runs in 11 innings, closely trailed by KKR's opener Phil Salt with 392 runs from 9 innings.","IPL Orange Cap is a multi-billion dollar investment by the Indian state-owned bank. The IPL is one of India's leading investment banks. The bank is also one of the largest in the world, with a market value of more than $1.2 billion.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109680685,imgsize-42044,width-400,resizemode-4/109680685.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Mumbai Indians are looking to rebound after back-to-back losses against Delhi Capitals and Rajasthan Royals when they face off against Lucknow Super Giants on Tuesday. With hopes of securing a win in Match 48, Mumbai aims to stay in contention for the playoffs of the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2024. The showdown is set to take place at the Ekana Cricket Stadium.As for the current standings, Lucknow Super Giants hold the fifth position with five wins and 10 points from nine matches, while Mumbai Indians lag behind in ninth place with three wins and six points from an equal number of matches.In their previous encounters, Lucknow Super Giants have had the upper hand, leading 3-1 in their head-to-head clashes. However, Mumbai Indians clinched a thrilling victory by five runs when they first met last year at the Ekana Cricket Ground.Also see: IPL live score The Ekana Cricket Stadium in IPL 2024 has seen five matches thus far, offering a mixed bag in terms of pitch conditions. Initially, the wicket appeared fresh with decent pace and bounce, favoring both batsmen and faster bowlers. However, it soon transitioned into the typical slow and sluggish pitch characteristic of Lucknow.In the recent LSG versus RR encounter, the pitch seemed more batting-friendly, witnessing a total of 395 runs scored in 39 overs, indicating favourable conditions for the batsmen.Also see: IPL match result As for the ground history, out of the five matches played, teams batting second have emerged victorious in three instances, while teams batting first have won twice. The average first innings score stands at 180, whereas the average second innings score is slightly lower at 171. The highest total recorded at the venue is 199/3 by Rajasthan Royals against Lucknow Super Giants, while the lowest total is 130 by Gujarat Titans against Lucknow Super Giants.With 378 runs in 9 innings, KL Rahul is leading from the front for Lucknow Super Giants in IPL 2024. His consistent performances at the top of the order have provided strong starts for his team, making him a reliable choice. Currently, he sits at seventh position in the Orange Cap race.Jasprit Bumrah has been a standout performer for Mumbai Indians, picking up 14 wickets in 9 matches. His ability to take crucial wickets at any stage of a T20 match makes him a valuable asset. Currently, he is the holder of the Purple Cap in IPL 2024. (Here's a list of updated Purple Cap list) Tilak Varma has been a consistent performer for Mumbai Indians, scoring 336 runs in 9 innings. The young left-handed batsman has been a pillar of strength in the MI batting lineup, often delivering crucial runs under pressure. He is a safe bet for fantasy teams in the upcoming game.Quinton de Kock, KL Rahul(w/c), Marcus Stoinis, Deepak Hooda, Nicholas Pooran, Ayush Badoni, Krunal Pandya, Matt Henry, Ravi Bishnoi, Mohsin Khan, Yash Thakur, Amit Mishra, Arshin Kulkarni, Krishnappa Gowtham, Manimaran Siddharth, Yudhvir Singh Charak, Mayank Yadav, Kyle Mayers, Ashton Turner, Prerak Mankad, Naveen-ul-Haq, Devdutt Padikkal, Arshad Khan, Shamar JosephIshan Kishan(w), Rohit Sharma , Suryakumar Yadav, Tilak Varma, Hardik Pandya(c), Nehal Wadhera, Tim David, Mohammad Nabi, Piyush Chawla, Luke Wood, Jasprit Bumrah, Nuwan Thushara, Naman Dhir, Shams Mulani, Dewald Brevis, Kumar Kartikeya, Shreyas Gopal, Harvik Desai, Gerald Coetzee, Romario Shepherd, Arjun Tendulkar, Shivalik Sharma, Anshul Kamboj, Akash Madhwal, Kwena MaphakaWicketkeepers: KL Rahul (C), Quinton de Kock, Ishan Kishan, Nicholas PooranBatters: Rohit Sharma, Suryakumar Yadav, Tilak VarmaAll-rounders: Krunal PandyaBowlers: Piyush Chawla, Jasprit Bumrah, Yash Thakur",Mumbai Indians take on Lucknow Super Giants in IPL 2024 on Tuesday.

CHENNAI: Chennai Super Kings are a near unstoppable force at home. The visiting IPL teams travel to the MA Chidambaram Stadium with a strong motivation to breach the ‘fortress’, but they more often than not leave empty-handed. This season has been no different.The Ruturaj Gaikwad-led CSK have won four out of five matches at Chepauk, the only home loss coming against Lucknow Super Giants following an exceptional batting effort by allrounder Marcus Stoinis.Brimming with confidence after decimating fellow playoff challengers Sunrisers Hyderabad in their last match here on Sunday, CSK will be keen to improve their already envious home record when they host Punjab Kings on Wednesday.Currently part of a midtable muddle, Super Kings will look to make the most of the home advantage as they chase a top-two berth. It must be considered that CSK have not been up to the mark on the road and will have only one home contest remaining in the league stage post the Punjab fixture (against current table-toppers Rajasthan Royals on May 12). Heading into what could be a must-win clash in the larger scheme of things, Super Kings have plenty to feel positive about.Ruturaj has been enjoying a purple patch, boasting four 50-plus scores, including two unbeaten knocks, in the past five matches. While the opening batter has been in ominous touch, he has had his fair share of struggles against a particular bowling type.With Ruturaj falling to left-arm pacers four times so far this season, the visitors may turn to stand-in captain Sam Curran or Arshdeep Singh to get the better of him. CSK’s other in-form batter, Shivam Dube, will fancy himself in the spin match-ups against leggie Rahul Chahar and left-armer Harpreet Brar as both the tweakers will traditionally bring the ball into him.Among the bowlers, Matheesha Pathirana and Ravindra Jadeja could hold the key against a batting lineup that is fresh off completing a world record chase. Pacer Tushar Deshpande, too, could be a weapon, after producing a fantastic performance in tough conditions (batting-friendly pitch and dew) in the previous game.The Punjab batting pack has enough firepower to upset CSK in their backyard. Jonny Bairstow, Prabhsimran Singh and Shashank Singh, stars of the historic win over Kolkata Knight Riders, will be eager to continue their boundary-hitting spree. But they will have their task cut out, cautioned Super Kings head coach Stephen Fleming.“Punjab will be buoyed by their performance in the last game. But they will also be realistic that they have to adjust to the conditions. Chepauk is different; the size of the ground and pitches are different. When you are away from home, you have to make those adjustments,” said Fleming.",Chennai Super Kings have won four out of five matches at Chepauk. The only home loss came against Lucknow Super Giants. CSK will be keen to improve their already envious home record.

NEW DELHI: Former cricketer Mohammad Kaif has lauded the Indian cricket team 's composition for the upcoming T20 World Cup made by chief selector Ajit Agarkar and his team. Kaif's remarks came following the announcement of the provisional squad, which witnessed the inclusion of some promising talents and the omission of a few established names.""Isse achchi team Ajit Agarkar nahi bana sakte the [Ajit Agarkar could not have made a better team than this],"" declared Kaif, emphasizing his confidence in the squad's strength and balance.He particularly highlighted the assortment of bowlers, noting the presence of four fast bowlers and four spinners, creating a formidable bowling unit.""A very strong team has been selected. It is very balanced - 4 fast bowlers, 4 spinners. Among the 8 bowlers there are three all-rounders - Axar Patel, Ravindra Jadeja and Hardik Pandya . There is also Shivam Dube who bowls, but I am not mentioning his name,"" Kaif said on Star Sports.Kaif's analysis delved into the batting order, spotlighting the opening pair of Yashasvi Jaiswal and Rohit Sharma. ""Jaiswal always gives a start, plays aggressive cricket. You will play day matches in the US and West Indies, there will be no dew factor there, you have to attack in the powerplay, play agressively. Jaiswal always play aggressive cricket, Rohit Sharma also gives aggressive start,"" he remarked, underlining the necessity of assertive batting, especially in matches without the dew factor.Addressing the middle order, Kaif deliberated on the choice between Rishabh Pant and Sanju Samson, leaning towards Samson due to his impressive record in West Indies conditions. He also commended the selection of all-rounders Axar Patel, Ravindra Jadeja, and Hardik Pandya for their versatility and ability to float in the batting order.Furthermore, Kaif applauded the inclusion of Shivam Dube over Rinku Singh, citing Dube's capability to contribute with both bat and ball. ""You can also give an over or two to Dube, so they have taken him, it's a good choice,"" he remarked, highlighting the strategic aspect of Dube's inclusion.Kaif reiterated his confidence in the squad's potential and expressed satisfaction with Agarkar's selections.

(AFP Photo)

KOCHI: Just like his batting, Sanju Samson 's name always creates a buzz on social media. His talent has never been in doubt ever since he announced his arrival before the cricketing world with his exploits in the IPL and the Champions League T20 in 2013, as former players rave about his strokeplay.However, after making his international debut in a T20 international in Harare back in 2015, critics have always questioned the Kerala wicketkeeper-batsman 's inconsistency.This has meant that the 29-year-old has only managed to play 25 T20Is and 16 ODIs in the last eight years.However, this IPL season has been different for Samson for more reasons than one. The Rajasthan Royals skipper has led his side with aplomb, which sees his team sitting at the top of the IPL points table with 16 points from nine games.But more importantly, this has been Samson's most consistent run in the IPL, with a match-winning unbeaten 33-ball 71 in Royals’ last game against Lucknow Super Giants being one of the high points of his career. He has amassed 385 runs from nine games at an average of 77 and a strike rate of 161.08 and is placed sixth in the run-scorer's chart in this IPL.Batting at no.3, Samson has been the glue in a star-studded Royals’ batting lineup and has switched his roles as an anchor and aggressor easily.But this change in Samson's batting hasn't come overnight.""For the last eight months, Sanju has trained specifically keeping the T20 World Cup in mind. He knew performance in the IPL just before the World Cup would be crucial. Our focus was more on his mental make-up before he went out to bat and while he was at the crease. He started focusing on the process. This change has reflected in his batting,"" says Bijumon N, who has been Samson's personal coach for the past year.""We did some minor alterations to his batting technique. If you notice now, his bat swing has changed and it is more free flowing,"" he added.Throughout his career, Samson was always at ease against pace bowlers but found himself susceptible to spinners. But as is evident in this IPL, there has been a marked improvement in that facet of his game.""I don’t agree with the assumption that Sanju is not good at tackling spinners. But against the real slow bowlers, at times he has found it difficult. To counter that, he has started to use his feet more now. On the tactical front, he has added a couple more strokes to his armoury against the spinners and has started playing each ball on its merit,"" revealed Bijumon.Bijumon travelled with Samson wherever Kerala played domestic cricket in the last season, and their training sessions always revolved around the bigger goal in mind.""During our training sessions in Alappuzha, Thiruvananthapuram, and Bengaluru, we did a lot of match simulations keeping in mind the IPL and the T20 World Cup. Even now, we keep talking over the phone after Rajasthan's each match and discuss the scope for improvement in his game,"" he said.However, the composition of the Indian team bound for the US means that Rishabh Pant will, in all probability, be the first-choice keeper of the team management. Having pipped the other contenders for the second wicketkeeper's slot, Samson's chance to make it to the playing XI is only likely to arise if Pant's form dips or if one of the top-order batters has a wretched run.There is a popular joke in Kerala cricket circles that India will only win World Cups if a Malayali is in the squad. Sunil Valson, a Kerala native, who played for Delhi in domestic cricket, was part of Kapil's 1983 World Cup-winning squad while S Sreesanth was in the Indian team that lifted the 2007 T20 World Cup and 2011 ODI World Cup. Will Samson prove to be Team India’s lucky charm in the US and the Caribbean?",Rajasthan Royals skipper Sanju Samson has led his side with aplomb. Samson has amassed 385 runs from nine games at an average of 77. The 29-year-old has only managed to play 25 T20Is and 16 ODIs in the last eight years.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109743215,imgsize-43488,width-400,resizemode-4/109743215.jpg"

With over 4,000 runs in Test cricket at an average of 45.46, he has cemented his place as a dependable opener, capable of withstanding the toughest bowling attacks.Rohit's leadership prowess has been on full display, particularly in the Indian Premier League (IPL), where he has led the Mumbai Indians to a record-breaking five titles. His astute captaincy and ability to inspire his teammates have made him a revered figure in the world of T20 cricket.The 2023 ODI World Cup served as another chapter in Rohit's storied career, where he finished as the tournament's second-highest run-scorer, showcasing his mettle on the grandest stage of them all.As Rohit continues to mesmerize cricketing aficionados with his elegant strokeplay and calm demeanor, his legacy as one of the game's true icons only continues to grow. On his 37th birthday, the cricketing fraternity joins together in celebrating the extraordinary journey of the man affectionately known as the ' Hitman ' of Indian cricket .","Rohit Sharma celebrates his 37th birthday on Tuesday.

"T20 World Cup: Hardik, second wicketkeeper's slot on agenda as selectors to meet in Ahmedabad on Tuesday",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-mens-t20-world-cup/t20-world-cup-hardik-second-wicketkeepers-slot-on-agenda-as-selectors-to-meet-in-ahmedabad-on-tuesday/articleshow/109701373.cms,"(With PTI inputs)

NEW DELHI: The national selection committee, headed by Ajit Agarkar, will convene in Ahmedabad on Tuesday to meet with BCCI secretary Jay Shah. The purpose of this meeting is to finalize the 15-member squad for the ICC T20 World Cup in the Americas, although the official announcement may be delayed by a day.Shah, who also serves as the convenor of the senior selection committee (men), has prior political commitments that are keeping him occupied.Therefore, the selection meeting will be held in Ahmedabad to accommodate his schedule.Key discussion points during the meeting will include deciding on the second wicketkeeper's slot and assessing the inclusion of all-rounder Hardik Pandya in the squad.It's understood that KL Rahul , with an IPL strike rate of 144 and 378 runs in the tournament so far, and Sanju Samson , who has scored 385 runs at a striking rate of 161, are vying for the second wicketkeeper's position.Despite Samson's impressive performances for Rajasthan Royals as their captain this season, marking the first time in over a decade he's shown such consistent form for his IPL team, his batting at No. 3 isn't likely to secure him a spot on the Indian team.Another school of thought is that someone like Samson, who has 25 T20Is under his belt but an average of just 20 and a strike rate of around 135, should not be considered based on just one good IPL season.In case of Rahul, it can be said that one senior member of the coaching staff will certainly go all out to push for his inclusion but many believe that the stylish right-handed batter's approach in T20 cricket remains archaic.However, he is still considered a better bet than Samson at No. 5 or 6 on slowish Caribbean tracks.The other option, Jitesh Sharma, is in very poor form, while Dhruv Jurel hasn't got a chance to keep wickets. During the last game in Lucknow, he did get an opportunity to bat long and scored a fifty.Left-handed batter Tilak Varma, who is also a handy off-spinner, remains an option along with pacer Sandeep Sharma, the Punjab veteran whose slower variations at the death have played a big role in Rajasthan Royals' surge to the top of the IPL table.","The national selection committee, headed by Ajit Agarkar, will convene in Ahmedabad on Tuesday to meet with BCCI secretary Jay Shah.

Hardik Pandya 's elevation to the Mumbai Indians captaincy has not gone down too well with the loyal fans of the five-time champions as he replaced the highly successful Rohit Sharma , a bonafide India legend and also the all-format national team captain.While some of the booing and hooting at the Wankhede has been toxic and unnecessary, the skipper has not done too much on the field to change the perceptions about him off it.Not bowling Jasprit Bumrah straight up, changing the playing XI repeatedly, changing his own batting slot constantly, he has shown all signs of a confused and a stressed leader. What's worse, it doesn't seem as if he has the dressing room pulling in one direction.What many felt was needless after the team's 10-run loss to Delhi Capitals was his criticism of Tilak Varma , the team's top run scorer with 63 off 32 balls, saying his lack of intent against Axar Patel cost MI the game.""Axar bowling to a left-hander (read Tilak), the better option could have been to go after him,"" Hardik told the official broadcasters after the game. ""I think it was just a little game awareness that we missed out. At the end of the day, that cost us the game.""Really? Let's analyse. Axar Patel bowled six balls to the promising left-hander off which he scored 14 runs. He had bowled to Tilak when MI had scored 72 for 3. Hardik was batting with Axar in the middle as MI had lost the wicket ofSuryakumar Yadav with the team score at 65.Tilak scored four off four balls off Axar in an attempt to momentarily consolidate till Hardik got his eye in. Once the partnership was set, he hit Axar for a six and a four prompting DC skipper Rishabh Pant to take him out of the attack.Moreover, if Hardik wanted Tilak to attack, wasn't he the best man to tell him as he was in the middle?If the skipper really wants to look at the reasons for MI's loss on Saturday, may be a closer look at his bowling figures 2-0-41-0 and the decision in sending an in-form Tim David out to bat at No. 7 on a small ground, may provide those.Picking on a youngster scouted and groomed by the franchise and an ex-skipper's favourite, won't help.",Hardik Pandya's elevation to the Mumbai Indians captaincy has not gone down too well with the loyal fans of the five-time champions. Some of the booing and hooting at the Wankhede has been toxic and unnecessary. He has not done too much on the field to change the perceptions about him off it.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109675613,imgsize-64922,width-400,resizemode-4/109675613.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Marcus Stoinis played a steady innings, scoring a composed fifty, to support the exceptional performance of the bowlers as the Lucknow Super Giants secured a tense four-wicket victory over the Mumbai Indians in the IPL on Tuesday, thereby bolstering their chances of securing a play-off spot.The Mumbai Indians' top order struggled, managing only a below-par total of 144 for seven, with contributions from Nehal Wadhera (46), Ishan Kishan (32), and Tim David (35 not out).In response, Stoinis scored 62 off 45 balls, including seven boundaries and two sixes. Despite his departure, LSG faced some nervous moments but managed to seal the win with four balls remaining.With their sixth win in 10 games, LSG moved up to third place in the IPL standings, while MI dropped to their seventh loss in 10 games.LSG made a watchful start to their chase after Nuwan Thushara struck with his fourth ball to remove impact sub Arshin Kulkarni for a duck on his IPL debut.Stoinis cracked two back-to-back boundaries off Gerald Coetzee, who ended up conceding 15 in his first over. K L Rahul (28 off 22) too joined the party, slamming three fours and a six to take 20 runs off Thushara.Stoinis then whacked Bumrah over longoff as LSG reached 52 in the powerplay.Mohammed Nabi held on to a skier at the boundary line as Hardik Pandya produced a breakthrough, removing Rahul.Stoinis, however, kept going strong as he and Deepak Hooda (18) added another 40 runs off 35 balls to take LSG close to 100.Hooda was then removed by Hardik but Stoinis reached his fifty off 39 balls in the 14th over and then dispatched Mohammed Nabi for a four and a six.Coetzee bowled Ashton Turner, while Ayush Badoni was run out to give hopes to MI before Nicholas Pooran (14 not out) knocked off the remaining runs.Earlier, MI dug in a big hole for themselves by losing four wickets in the powerplay. The visitors just couldn't recover from the hiccup despite a 53-run fifth-wicket stand between Wadhera and Kishan.Tim David hit a few shots in the end, including a 17-run last over, to give the total some semblance of respectability.MI's top-order misfired as the visitors managed just 28 for four in the first six overs, the second-lowest powerplay score of this IPL.While Rohit Sharma (4) was sent back by left arm pacer Mohin Khan, Stoinis induced a fine edge with a slow ball to get rid of Suryakumar Yadav (10).MI slipped into further trouble when Ravi Bishnoi's direct throw found in-form Tilak Varma short of the crease.Skipper Hardik then was out for a golden duck after poking at an away going delivery from Naveen Ul Haq, as MI slumped to 27 for four in 5.2 overs.LSG used Stoinis well in the powerplay as his spell of three overs with the new ball yielded a wicket for 19.Returning from injury, pace sensation Mayank Yadav could have had a wicket but Turner dropped Ishan Kishan (32) at deep square leg.Kishan and Nehal Wadhera tried to steady the ship with their fifth wicket stand but LSG bowlers didn't give much away as MI reached 68 for four in 12 overs.With seven overs remaining, Kishan tried to up the ante only to fall for a Bishnoi googly. Wadhera, however, smashed Mayank for two sixes and a four as 16 runs came off the 15th over.Mohammed Nabi then dragged one on to the stumps off Mayank, who left the field immediately, raising concerns of injury.","Lucknow Super Giants beat Mumbai Indians by four wickets in IPL.

NEW DELHI: Renowned Inter Miami star and eight-time Ballon d'Or winner Lionel Messi took a break from his football duties to attend the Miami Heat playoff game against the Boston Celtics on Monday night.Accompanied by his teammates Jordi Alba , Sergio Busquets , and Luis Suarez , who also played with him at Barcelona, Messi arrived at the arena just before tip-off.The group, with some wearing Heat attire and Busquets donning a Heat hoodie, entered through the players' parking garage and were escorted via a VIP entrance to their suite seats above the lower level.Although Messi had previously visited the arena for at least one other event, this marked his first arranged attendance at a Heat game since relocating to Miami last year.Inter Miami have been performing exceptionally well in the Major League Soccer (MLS) this season, boasting a 6-2-3 record and currently leading the Eastern Conference with the highest points tally in the league.Messi's contributions have been instrumental, with two goals and an assist in Inter Miami's recent 4-1 victory over New England on Saturday. He has achieved the remarkable feat of having multiple goal contributions in five consecutive matches, a first for any MLS player.Throughout his illustrious career, Messi has amassed over 800 goals for both club and country, solidifying his status as one of the greatest scorers in soccer history.His crowning achievement came in 2022 when he led Argentina to the World Cup title, scoring twice in the final against France. The match ended in a thrilling 3-3 draw, with Argentina ultimately triumphing 4-2 on penalty kicks.","Lionel Messi attended the Miami Heat playoff game against the Boston Celtics.

ISL: Mumbai see off Goa to set up final showdown with Bagan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/indian-super-league/top-stories/isl-mumbai-see-off-goa-to-set-up-final-showdown-with-bagan/articleshow/109703553.cms,"MUMBAI: Jorge Pereyra Diaz wanted to lap up every second of it. The Argentinian striker had just given Mumbai the lead in the second leg of their Indian Super League semifinal against FC Goa , putting the Islanders 4-2 ahead on aggregate, and he was in the mood to celebrate.Joining him were thousands of Mumbai City fans who made sure their delight was heard around the 7000-capacity Mumbai Football Arena.They had to wait until the 69th minute for that joyous moment, and it was to get even better seven minutes from the end of regulation time.This time it was Lallianzuala Chhangte who timed his run perfectly from inside his half to latch on to a sublime assist from Vikram Partap Singh, neatly take it past Goa goalkeeper Dheeraj Singh, and tap the ball into the net to make it 2-0. For the second time in five days, Goa were left crestfallen.They had been looking good to arrive here with a 2-0 lead from their first leg at Fatorda last Wednesday. But in a matter of six crazy minutes in the closing stages of that game, the Gaurs watched in agony as Chhangte and Vikram turned that lead into a 3-2 win in favour of the Islanders.Despite that slap in the face, Manolo Marquez's side, backed by around 250 travelling fans, would have come to Mumbai encouraged by their form on the road, having scored in their last nine away games. It's another matter that they were up against the league's meanest defence, and the latter eventually won.Mumbai's 2-0 victory on Monday and a 5-2 win on aggregate has earned them the right to take on Mohun Bagan Super Giant in Saturday's final. Petr Kratky's side will look at it as a chance to avenge their narrow defeat to the Kolkata giants a fortnight ago on the last day of the league stage which saw Bagan thwart Mumbai's hopes of becoming the first team to defend the League Winners Shield.For now though, the Islanders will cherish a win they had to work extremely hard for, against an opponent who has challenged them each time they have met this season.They may have endured a nightmare finish to the first leg of this semifinal but Goa managed to make a positive start here, looking clearly to their American winger Noah Sadaoui to launch attacks down the left channel.After his tremendous impact as a second half substitute in Fatorda, where he produced two sublime assists for the goals that contributed to Mumbai's jaw-dropping comeback, Jayesh Rane was duly rewarded with a starting spot on this occasion. But the midfielder struggled to get his teeth into the game for most of the first half.The home side soon settled and would come the closest to scoring in the opening 45 minutes when they struck the post twice, first through a Tiri header off a corner, and later when Chhangte wasn't able to curl his left-footed effort enough.In his pre-match press conference, Marquez had admitted that the Gaurs could well find themselves in a situation where they would have to take increased risks. That moment arrived in the second half when Mumbai captain Rahul Bheke saw his header off Yoel van Nieff's corner cleared off the goal line by Goa defender Nim Dorjee Tamang. But Pereyra Diaz was there, as he usually is, perfectly placed, to poke the ball home.Vikram has scored eight times for the Islanders in the league this season, including a hat-trick against NorthEast United in March, but the forward showed how well he can create opportunities too, releasing Chhangte with a delightful pass around Goa's defence, as Mumbai's number 7 got the home support going again with a fine finish.There are likely to be questions raised about the relevance of the ISL playoffs going forward, with the format now really holding no significance apart from the prize money on offer. What there can be little doubt about though, is the two best teams over the course of the 2023-24 campaign will clash for the trophy at Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday!","Mumbai City beat FC Goa 4-2 on aggregate to reach Indian Super League final.

Bayern Munich manager Thomas Tuchel emphasised on Monday that his team is fully prepared to confront the formidable threat posed by the ""extraordinary"" Real Madrid midfielder, Jude Bellingham , in their upcoming home Champions League semi-final, first leg clash.The highly anticipated match, scheduled for Tuesday, pits the 14-time Champions League winners, Real Madrid, against Bayern Munich, who boast six titles in the competition.This encounter stands as the most frequently played semi-final fixture in the history of the tournament.Bellingham, the 20-year-old English midfielder, made a significant move to Real Madrid from Bundesliga outfit Borussia Dortmund at the beginning of the season.Since his arrival, Bellingham has rapidly established himself as a linchpin in Real's midfield, earning accolades as one of the world's premier talents. Impressively, despite primarily operating in midfield, he leads Real Madrid's league goal-scoring charts this season with 17 goals to his name.Tuchel's acknowledgment of Bellingham's prowess underlines the recognition within Bayern Munich's camp of the threat posed by the young midfielder. As the two European giants lock horns, the spotlight will undoubtedly be on Bellingham as he seeks to maintain his influential presence and impact on the semi-final stage.Tuchel said Bellingham was ""a key player in a very offensive position"" for the Spanish giants.""Jude is extraordinary. He was fantastic here in the Bundesliga, how he progressed shows the level of personality he has, it's only possible with a huge personality.""Everyone who plays for Madrid plays with the pressure of the shirt. He plays with the pressure to play with this club and all the expectations.""He handles it like he's never done anything else,"" said Tuchel.

Mohun Bagan stay in hunt of doing a rare double in ISL,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/indian-super-league/top-stories/mohun-bagan-stay-in-hunt-of-doing-a-rare-double-in-isl/articleshow/109679829.cms,"KOLKATA: Mohun Bagan SG stayed on course for a rare 'double' in Indian Super League , beating Odisha FC 2-0 in the second leg of semifinals and 3-2 on aggregate to reach the final on Sunday.Trailing 1-2 in the first leg of semifinals, Antonio Lopez Habas 's team turned it around in front of 62,007 spectators at the Salt Lake Stadium , with goals from Jason Cummings (22 nd minute) and Sahal Abdul Samad (90+3) sealing the deal here and confirming their passage to the title round for the second successive season.Two weeks after clinching their maiden Winners' Shield, the defending ISL champions are now waiting to welcome either Mumbai City FC or FC Goa in the final, which will be held at the Salt Lake Stadium on May 4.Habas's team is also staring at the prospect of emulating Mumbai City's feat in winning both the Shield and the league in the same season.With much at stake, both teams kept challenging each other throughout 90 minutes. It was an entertaining contest spiced with hits and misses.The onus was more on Mohun Bagan to take the bull by the horns, but they also ran the risk of being sliced open on every slip by Roy Krishna and Co.Habas employed a high defensive high line in a virtual 3-2-4-1 formation to embrace Odisha's challenge with both discipline and boldness.However, such a system comes with its own risks and rewards. Krishna's pace and potency down the right always left Bagan full-back Subhasish Bose and others searching for answers. At least on three such occasions in the first 45 minutes, Bagan survived scares born of the Fijian's feet. Anwar Ali first cleared the danger with a nick-of-the-time intervention, Diego Mauricio then failed to keep Krishna's cutback on target and Hector Yuste --- who failed to prevent Krishna from scoring Odisha's winner in the first leg --- rose to the occasion, denying Isak Ralte with a goalline save.Thus reprieved, Bagan ended the first half with the reward. Petratos, receiving the ball from Liston Colaco, tested Amrinder Singh with a snap shot. Although the Odisha goalkeeper managed to block it, Cummings reacted quickest to tap in the rebound. Odisha protested for an offside but as the assistant referee's flag stayed down, Cummings was already in the embrace of his teammates, celebrating and sending the loud and boisterous stands into rapture.The second half was more open. Bagan --- who were showing more intention of winning the contest within regulation time --- should have swelled the lead in the 58th minute. Liston Colaco's delivery across the face of goal found no taker to make the most of it. Manvir retrieved it at the other end and sent it back into the Odisha FC box. Anirudh Thapa met it with a deft header only to see the ball roll down through the legs of Amrinder and miss the far post by a whisker.Odisha kept soaking up the pressure, perhaps trying to turn it into a battle of attrition as extra-times loomed. But when Manvir raided their box in the third minute of stoppage time, it became the decisive moment. His pacey run left Odisha defence in tatters and as he sent it towards the goal, Sahal --- who replaced Thapa in the 71st minute --- ghosted in from behind. Just like the first goal, Amrinder managed to block the first attempt by Sahal, but the ball bounced up to hit the Bagan substitute and went in.Odisha threw the kitchen sink in search of a goal which could have taken the contest into extra times, but Bagan held their nerves, fighting on the back of their pluck and luck in crossing the finishing line.","Mohun Bagan SG beat Odisha FC 2-0 in the second leg of semifinals and 3-2 on aggregate to reach the final on Sunday.

Despite a double-break deficit in the second set, Nadal fought back to force a tiebreak, but Cachin mounted another surge to level the match.In the deciding set, Nadal faced resistance from Cachin, who thwarted two break opportunities before equalizing the score at 2-2. However, Nadal capitalized on his chances and maintained his composure, eventually sealing victory as Cachin committed his 41st unforced error of the match.Nadal's ability to weather challenges and find openings demonstrated his unwavering determination and unmatched skill on his favored surface.","Rafael Nadal beats Pedro Cachin 6-1, 6-7 (5/7), 6-3 at Madrid Open.
