Taylor Swift Has “Distanced” Herself From Blake Lively Because Of This Reason, Fans Say



Blake Lively Was Not Spotted With Taylor Swift At Super Bowl 2025



Taylor Swift, the billionaire pop star, has been in the news since she got booed at the Super Bowl last weekend when Travis Kelce’s team, the Kansas City Chiefs lost the trophy to the Philadelphia Eagles. Away from the Super Bowl drama, the pop star has also found herself involved in the legal drama between Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni. But now, the reason why Taylor Swift has “distanced” herself from Blake Lively is pretty clear, according to fans.Taylor Swift has remained pretty silent about the whole controversial situation and is yet to make an official announcement about it. It seems like fans have found the reason behind it.A fan took to X and wrote, “The fact that Taylor Swift, huge advocate of the womens movement, didnt support bestie Blake Lively speaks volumes. If anyone would support, know and have proof that Blake was harrassed it would be Taylor Swift. Talks, calls, texts...Yet Taylor didn't support it. Hmmm”Another fan wrote, “If my bestfriend who made me godmother to her children was in a legal battle over sexual harassment & retaliation, I would be standing ten toes down with her. I would not abandon her. The fact that Taylor Swift distanced herself from Blake Lively is damning enough.”While it is not confirmed why Taylor Swift has not been spotted recently with her best friend, Blake Lively, fans are pretty convinced that this is the reason behind it.For the unversed, Blake Lively had accused Justin Baldoni of harassment and Justin filed a counter lawsuit against Blake Lively and her husband Ryan Reynolds accusing them of defamation and trying to take over control of their blockbuster movie, It Ends With Us. Taylor Swift was named by Justin Baldoni in the lawsuit as he felt Blake Lively tried to “use” Taylor Swift’s power and influence to gain control of the movie.Many fans also expected to see Taylor Swift and Blake Lively at the Super Bowl held last weekend but Blake was nowhere to be found at the stadium. This was in complete contrast to the 2024 Super Bowl when Blake Lively was spotted cheering on Travis Kelce as she stood next to Taylor Swift. The two were also spotted hugging each other when the Kansas City Chiefs won the trophy last year.A few days ago, a source revealed to Page Six that “Taylor really wishes Blake hadn’t dragged her into this whole situation.” This might be true considering how Taylor Swift has avoided being spotted with Blake Lively.With the Chiefs losing the Super Bowl, both Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift have been trolled but have remained silent.Also Read: Hailee Steinfeld reacts as Josh Allen gets asked out on a date during their appearance at NFL Honors","Taylor Swift has been in the news since she got booed at the Super Bowl last weekend when Travis Kelce’s team, the Kansas City Chiefs lost the trophy to the Philadelphia Eagles.

Pete Alonso Influence: Juan Soto Drops Bombshell: Pete Alonso Was the Game-Changer in His Mets Free Agency Decision,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/mlb/news/juan-soto-drops-bombshell-pete-alonso-was-the-game-changer-in-his-mets-free-agency-decision/articleshow/118311067.cms,"Juan Soto by Alex Brandon/AP

Pete Alonso’s Game-Changing Influence on Juan Soto’s Mets Decision

Juan Soto speaks live from New York Mets spring training in Port St. Lucie | SNY

“We’re trying to make sure that we have the cover of Pete. He’s one of the best pure power hitters in the league, so we’re trying to have some of that protection,”

The Rise of a Dominant Slugging Duo

A Must-Watch Season Ahead



At spring training, New York Mets legend Juan Soto broke news reporting that Pete Alonso was a principal reason he became a member of the team. Though the strength of the Mets' roster entered into it, Soto was impressed by Alonso's power in the batter's box as one of the strongest reasons he came on board. With the 2025 season approaching, there is great fan expectation for how this dynamic pairing will affect it.When asked what excites him most about the Mets’ lineup, Soto didn’t hesitate to name Pete Alonso. He praised Alonso’s power-hitting ability and the depth he brings to the lineup, making opposing pitchers think twice before throwing around Soto.Soto acknowledged that Alonso was frequently discussed during his free agency talks with the Mets. He noted that having a slugger of Alonso’s caliber batting behind him would provide the protection needed to see better pitches, similar to how Aaron Judge played that role for him in the New York Yankees’ lineup last season.Soto said, per SNY.With Soto and Alonso at the forefront of the Mets' offense, the team has one of the best hitting combinations in the league. Soto's on-base skills and Alonso's home run-hitting ability make them a nightmare for pitchers.With Pete Alonso and Juan Soto leading the lineup, the Mets' 2025 season will be thrilling. Pitchers will need to deal with one of these sluggers in clutch situations, so every at-bat will be a difficult task. With Alonso serving as protection, Soto might experience an increase in his performance, making the Mets' already potent offense even more lethal. Beyond even this season, keeping Alonso in the long term may be a deciding factor in determining the Mets' playoff hopes and overall competitiveness for the next several years.Soto’s candid remarks highlight Alonso’s importance in shaping the Mets’ future. As the 2025 season unfolds, fans will be watching closely to see if this power duo can lead the team to postseason success. With both sluggers aiming to dominate, the Mets might have just assembled one of the most feared offensive lineups in baseball.Also Read: Watch: Boston Red Sox welcome Alex Bregman with epic ‘It’s Official’ video","New York Mets legend Juan Soto said that Pete Alonso was a principal reason he became a member of the team.

Travis Hunter , the 2024 Heisman Trophy winner known for playing both wide receiver and cornerback at Colorado, has been officially listed as a defensive back for the upcoming NFL Scouting Combine . Despite excelling on both offense and defense, this suggests that NFL scouts see his future primarily as a cornerback.

He became the first player to ever win both the Chuck Bednarik Award, given to the nation’s best defensive player, and the Fred Biletnikoff Award, which recognizes the top wide receiver.

Offensively, he caught 92 passes for 1,152 yards and 14 touchdowns, while defensively, he made 32 tackles and intercepted four passes.

Pittsburgh Steelers Have Eyes On Los Angeles Rams' QB Matthew Stafford,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/pittsburgh-steelers-have-eyes-on-los-angeles-rams-qb-matthew-stafford/articleshow/118304112.cms,"(Image via Getty)

Anyway, the Pittsburgh Steelers may bid goodbye to Russell Wilson and go for Los Angeles Rams star quarterback and Kelly Stafford's husband, Matthew Stafford

Steelers QB Rumors Take Wild Turn

The Steelers may be preparing for another reset for their quarterback room, as both Russell Wilson and

Justin Fields

are looking for new deals. Things aren't exactly peachy in Pittsburgh right now. No one cares that Mike Tomlin hadn't registered a losing season in 18 straight years with the Steelers because Pittsburgh hasn't won a playoff game since 2016.

The Steelers have lost six straight postseason matchups and have allowed at least 28 points in all six of those losses. It's the longest such streak in NFL history! What's the best option for Pittsburgh at the quarterback? Trading up in the draft and hoping Cam Ward or Shedeur Sanders is the answer? Probably not. Do the Steelers want to enter the bidding war for Sam Darnold? Or take a flier on the 41-year-old

Aaron Rodgers

? Maybe Stafford is the best option- if he's made available.

Who will it be for the Pittsburgh Steelers? Jets QB Aaron Rodgers or Rams QB Matthew Stafford?

Would the Rams be crazy to trade QB Matthew Stafford? | NFL | THE FACILITY

Prior to Super Bowl week, and knowing things weren't perfect between Wilson and the team, I thought Wilson loomed as a tread-water type of option for the Steelers if other efforts failed in 2025.

But seeing the pro-Wilson narrative on the '25 pushed through? I don't think that's going over great inside that building. Meanwhile, the team would love to keep working with Fields. I just don't think they'll hand him the starting job. So the idea of Aaron Rodgers or Stafford could appeal to the Steelers. If that doesn't work, I think Pittsburgh looks at Fields with someone there to compete with him.

Los Angeles Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford is 37 years old, New York Jets quarterback is 41 years old, and Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Russell Wilson is 36 years old

Stephen A. Smith FLOATS the idea of Aaron Rodgers to the Steelers?! | First Take

I just think that we have kind of overrated Matthew Stafford a little bit since the Super Bowl victory. He's been good, but this year, he is starting to show his age. At the end of the day, if you're in Pittsburgh, you have to have a lot of things great around you for Matthew Stafford to have success. And I think that's where they're not standing right now.

If it's not QB Russell Wilson and QB Justin Fields, then is it QB Matthew Stafford for the Pittsburgh Steelers?

Evaluating potential trades for Matthew Stafford this offseason | Are these trades viable?

The Steelers need a quarterback and aren't within range of drafting a young signal-caller in what is, by all accounts, a thin draft class at the position. So, instead of trying to run it back with Russell Wilson and/or Justin Fields, they make a splash by adding Stafford to contend in the AFC North.

These would be Ciara 's NFL husband's last few days with the Pittsburgh Steelers.According to CBS Sports, ""Sports Illustrated Insider Albert Breer thinks Matthew Stafford is the likely option for the Pittsburgh Steelers. He shared, ""Someone from CBS Sports isn't happy about the whole Matthew Stafford for Pittsburgh Steelers idea. CBS Sports Analyst Emory Hunt shared, ""CBS Sports Writer Tyler Sullivan shared, ""Only time will tell where quarterback Russell Wilson will land, quarterback Justin Fields will fly, and where quarterback Matthew Stafford will settle. Till then, keep your fingers crossed! May the Pittsburgh Steelers finally get what they wished for.",Pittsburgh Steelers' star quarterback Russell Wilson will not return for the 2025 NFL season. Wilson ended the season with 9 wins and 7 losses. The Steelers have lost six straight postseason matchups and have allowed at least 28 points in all six of those losses.

India’s squad for ICC Champions Trophy, 2025:

Late in the afternoon on February 15, an unusual frenzy gripped the business class arrivals lounge of the Dubai International Airport. The word had travelled that the Indian cricket team was going to land shortly and plenty of fans had assembled to catch a glimpse of their favourite superstars. The area which generally sees passengers quietly make their way to the fleet of luxury vehicles waiting outside was buzzing with activity.Security officials were working overdrive when the flight carrying the Men in Blue landed on the runway. Few luggage trolleys were used to cordon off the area and the intensity picked up when the local police directed everyone to vacate the lounge area and head to the parking lot outside. There were loud cheers when head coach Gautam Gambhir led the entourage to the team bus. Everyone - from Virat Kohli to Hardik Pandya to Shreyas Iyer - acknowledged the fans while boarding the team bus.When the players took their respective seats, the waiting fans kept looking inside because captain Rohit Sharma was yet to exit the building. And when he did, there were loud cheers for the Hitman who walked briskly to the waiting bus and even summoned the security official for some instructions. Did he forget something again? Eh, not quite sure but you never know! The bus left the airport and KL Rahul, who made his way out at least 20 minutes after the team, took a separate car to the team hotel.Business as usual resumed after that and the usual calm was restored to the business class arrivals lounge. The ICC Champions Trophy 's first match in Dubai is still some days away and the buzz has naturally been missing in the city. And quite understandably so. Only India would be parked here because the rest of the teams will play their matches in Pakistan, the official hosts of the tournament. The teams allotted fixtures vs India will travel to Dubai and then head back as per the hybrid arrangement okayed by the International Cricket Council (ICC).The tournament gets underway on February 19 with India playing their opening match vs Bangladesh in Dubai on February 20. The large section of Bangladeshis residing here are excited to see their heroes in action and sound very optimistic on their chances too. The only question on their lips is ""when will the Bangladesh team land?"" and they certainly sound confident of taking a Jasprit Bumrah-less India down in their tournament opener.""I support Bangladesh and want them to win. It will be difficult but easier than before because Jasprit Bumrah , the dangerman, is not here. And we have good pacers. So it will not be an easy game for India as pacers do well in Dubai,"" said a cab driver who makes multiple trips to the airport in a day.""Pakistan is 50-50. They can do anything on their day but when it's not their day, they are a difficult team to even watch on TV (laughs),"" he added on the hosts' chances.Pakistan, the defending champions, will put their credentials to the test in the opener against New Zealand in Karachi.Rohit Sharma (Captain), Shubman Gill (Vice-captain), Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul (WK), Rishabh Pant (WK), Hardik Pandya, Axar Patel, Washington Sundar, Kuldeep Yadav, Harshit Rana, Mohd.

BHUBANESWAR: The Indian men's hockey team came back from their opening loss in style to beat Spain 2-0 in the FIH Pro League on Sunday. Mandeep Singh and Dilpreet Singh scored as Spain failed to take advantage of Harmanpreet Singh 's absence with India's talismanic skipper rested due to wrist injury.The Indian women's team, however, couldn't continue their winning run and it was England who grabbed the bonus point after the match finished 2-2 after 60 minutes.Savita Punia did everything she could to make sure India won the shootouts, making four successive saves. All the Indian attackers had to do was convert one of their four shots after Navneet Kaur scored the first one.But Salima Tete, Sunelita Toppo, Lalremsiami, and Neha all failed to hit the target. It went to sudden death after England converted their last shot; even here Savita made a save but India missed both their chances and Sophie Hamilton scored the winner to help England grab the bonus point.Coach Harendra Singh was all praise for Savita but rued missing out on the bonus point. ""It was frustrating because we had to score only one. But this is also part of the game. I'm happy we still got one point,"" he said.Earlier, England took the lead after Paige Gillott scored in the 40th minute. But Navneet converted a stroke in the 53rd to help India equalise. England regained the lead soon after after Tessa Howard made most of a PC.Debutant Rutuja Pisal Dadaso drew parity in the 57th minute following a lovely through ball from Sunelita down the middle to take the game into shootouts.In the men's, meanwhile, it was all square till half-time as a new-look India struggled to create chances early on. Besides Harmanpreet, there were five more changes to the team and they took their time to take control of the game.It finally happened two minutes into the third quarter when Mandeep scored following some quick passing between Manpreet Singh , Sukhjeet Singh and Dilpreet.",Mandeep Singh and Dilpreet Singh score as India beat Spain 2-0 in the FIH Pro League.

AHMEDABAD: Kerala and Gujarat made the semi-finals of the Ranji Trophy , which will begin here from Monday, in contrasting ways. While Kerala barely managed to squeeze through based on a one-run first-innings lead in the quarter-final against Jammu and Kashmir, Gujarat were supremely dominant, pulling off a triumph by an innings and 98 runs against Saurashtra, making it their second win by an innings in their last three matches.The attributes common between both sides, however, are strong team spirit, desire to fight till the end and a hunger to excel across departments. Should they beat Gujarat, it would prove a historic moment for Kerala, who will then be recording their first-ever appearance in a Ranji final. A Gujarat triumph, on the other hand, will result in them entering the final after their triumphant 2016-17 season, in which they beat Mumbai for the title.A close look at the runscoring charts across both teams tells us the absence of even a single player in the top 20 of leading run-scorers. Gujarat’s Jaymeet Patel (582 runs) is best placed in this regard, occupying the 21st position. Teammate Manan Hingrajia ranks next highest in 24th position after accumulating 570 runs. Salman Nizar is the top run-getter for Kerala, scoring 555 runs.However, players across both these sides have stepped up whenever the occasion has demanded, as was evident from the strong partnership under pressure between Kerala’s Nizar and Mohammed Azharuddeen against Jammu & Kashmir. The two batters stayed resolute despite the intensity in the spells delivered by the Jammu & Kashmir bowlers and the weight of expectation.","Kerala and Gujarat made the semi-finals of the Ranji Trophy.

Cale Maker is hoping to play against Finland

Canada's top defenceman, Cale Makar , is hoping to suit up for a crucial game against Finland. Makar, along with other players who did not play in Saturday's game against the U.S., is looking to play ""everything I can to play"" on Monday. The team opted for an optional skate after arriving late in Boston. Makar's on-ice presence was notable after the Colorado Avalanche star defenceman missed Saturday's contest with an illness.Cale Makar faces a tough decision to miss the 4 Nations Face-Off game between Canada and the US, especially after the Canadians lost. With a crucial game against Finland on Monday, Makar will do his best to support Canada. “I’m going to do everything I can to play tomorrow,” Makar said during an optional skate on Sunday. “I just got to make sure I feel right.”The Colorado Avalanche defenseman, who was expected to be in the lineup, was unable to practice due to an illness. He was replaced by Thomas Harley, a recent addition to the roster, just before the game. Canada lost 3-1 to the United States, despite Makar's absence on the blueline. Canada scored the lone goal with Connor McDavid's solo rush, but the United States scored three unanswered goals by Jake Guentzel, Dylan Larkin, and Guentzel in the empty net, securing a spot in the championship game.Makar, unable to play for the Canadians on Saturday, felt the decision was right, considering the long run as the Avalanche aims to secure a playoff spot after the 4 Nations Face-Off concludes. “I’ve got to do what’s best for myself and make sure I’m ready to go for the rest of the season,” said Makar.Also Read: “Respect the anthems”: Canada's captain Sidney Crosby reacts to the booing of the United States National anthem Canada is in a three-way tie with Finland and Sweden for the second berth in the championship game against the US. A regulation win over Finland will secure their spot in the final game, as they would hold the tiebreaker over Sweden if they beat the US. However, if Canada can only secure an overtime win, they will need help from the USA to secure the spot, and losing would result in a premature exit.","Canada's top defenceman, Cale Makar, is hoping to suit up for a crucial game against Finland.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.
