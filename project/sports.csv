After nearly two years of swirling headlines, viral moments, and subtle public appearances, Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce have finally made their much-awaited red carpet debut—sending fans into a frenzy. The beloved pop star and the Kansas City Chiefs tight end walked hand-in-hand into the opening night of Tight End University in Nashville on June 23, 2025, and it was nothing short of a rom-com-worthy moment.Co-founded in 2021 by Kelce, alongside NFL peer George Kittle and sportscaster Greg Olsen, Tight End University serves as a three-day summer training camp focused on elevating the skill set of NFL tight ends. According to the event's official website, it’s a place where tight ends “bond, collaborate with, and learn amongst their peers while participating in a variety of activities including film study, on-field drills, recovery, rehabilitation, and more. ”But this year’s kickoff wasn’t just about football. The spotlight landed squarely on the couple as they made their first official red carpet entrance together. A video posted by Tight End University’s Instagram account captured Swift and Kelce arriving in style, grinning ear to ear, and pausing for cameras as fans watched in awe.

Will the Utah Jazz trade Walker Kessler to the Los Angeles Lakers?



Why Los Angeles Lakers eyeing Walker Kessler to include in their roster?



The Los Angeles Lakers continue to show strong interest in acquiring Utah Jazz center Walker Kessler, according to recent reports. The team is reportedly willing to include multiple draft picks in a potential deal. It appears that they are serious about adding frontcourt depth. While talks have taken place, Utah has yet to accept any offer. So far, the situation is fluid as trade discussions continue. With LeBron James and Luka Doncic already headlining the roster, the Lakers appear focused on strengthening their interior defense ahead of the upcoming season.The Utah Jazz are heading into the 2025 NBA Draft with four picks and a roster full of young talent. After finishing with a league-worst 17 wins last season, the team is clearly in rebuild mode. Trade buzz has started to grow, especially around their frontcourt duo of Lauri Markkanen and Walker Kessler.Kessler, in particular, has drawn attention from playoff contenders like the Los Angeles Lakers. Despite the outside interest, Utah hasn’t shown much willingness to move the young center. However, Bleacher Report’s Dan Favale predicted the Jazz could “sell high” on Kessler before next season.""Freshly installed Utah Jazz president of basketball operations Austin Ainge is decidedly anti-tank. Dealing Walker Kessler would seem to run in opposition to that moral compass. Except not tanking in the Western Conference looks a lot like going about your business as usual. The Jazz aren't nearly close enough to contention for them to aggressively consolidate, and Kessler is someone more valuable to a team that needs a finishing touch rather than a cornerstone,"" Favale shared.Favale added, ""Extending the 23-year-old is absolutely on the table. Despite Utah's overall struggles, he has shown that he can act as the base of an interior defense, and his offensive utility may stretch beyond traditional big-man means if you buy into his 54 percent clip from floater range and three-point exploration. But this is all precisely why they may be able to get a tiny ransom for his services. Do the Los Angeles Lakers offer the Mark Williams Special (Dalton Knecht, 2031 first-round pick and a swap in 2030 and/or 2032)? Could the Jazz finagle another lottery pick from the Toronto Raptors (No. 9)? Or, along with other stuff, from the Chicago Bulls (No. 12)?""NBA insider Andy Larsen has recently shared that the Lakers have a strong interest in the $13,372,418 Power forward/ Center.Here’s why the Lakers could be interested in Kessler—- Walker Kessler may be more valuable to a contending team than to a rebuilding roster like Utah’s.- Extending Kessler is still a possibility, given his age (23) and defensive value.- Kessler has shown growth offensively, including shooting 54% from floater range and showing signs of three-point potential.Also Read: NBA Trade Rumors: Philadelphia 76ers reportedly exploring options to move $212 million star Paul George In the 2024-25 season, Kessler averaged 11.1 points per game, 12.2 rebounds, 1.7 assists, with a 66.3 field goal percentage.","The Los Angeles Lakers continue to show strong interest in acquiring Utah Jazz center Walker Kessler.

Vegas Golden Knights may clear cap space for Mitch Marner signing amid Alex Pietrangelo health concerns



Toronto Maple Leafs fans react to Mitch Marner exit rumors as his wife Stephanie Marner’s Vegas visit gains attention



With free agency set to open on July 1, Mitch Marner is once again at the center of major offseason speculation. A new twist arrived when insider Frank Seravalli reported that Marner and his wife, Stephanie Marner, were recently spotted viewing real estate in Las Vegas. The couple’s house-hunting trip has amplified talk that the Toronto Maple Leafs forward could be preparing for a major move away from Toronto.The Vegas Golden Knights’ connection to Mitch Marner has become more than just speculation. Although the team has only $9.6 million in available cap space according to Puck Pedia, potential roster shifts could open up room for a major signing. Among the possibilities, defenseman Alex Pietrangelo’s uncertain health status might lead to a long-term injured reserve placement, freeing up an additional $8.8 million.Meanwhile, forward William Karlsson has also been floated in trade rumors. If the Golden Knights can move his contract, they could create just enough room to land a superstar forward like Marner.

Aaron Ekblad: Two-Time Stanley Cup Champion Talks Season, Free Agency, Parade, More

Why the lack of negotiation with Aaron Ekblad is raising alarm



What the Aaron Ekblad contract update means for the Florida Panthers



How does this surprising turn affect the Panthers' offseason plans



What comes next for Aaron Ekblad and the Florida Panthers



The Florida Panthers may be on the verge of losing one of their most reliable cornerstones. Aaron Ekblad, a crucial part of Florida’s 2025 Stanley Cup-winning squad, is reportedly leaning toward free agency. For most fans, this was the last thing they expected. Ekblad had stated his desire to remain with the Panthers long-term, giving many the impression that a deal would be easily reached.While names like Brad Marchand and Sam Bennett have dominated Florida’s offseason headlines, the silence surrounding Aaron Ekblad has become deafening. Reports suggest that there has been little to no negotiation between Ekblad and the Panthers all year. TSN’s Pierre LeBrun confirmed this sentiment, noting that he believes Ekblad is headed to the open market.It’s a puzzling development. Ekblad is only 29 and still one of the league’s top blue-liners, he has shown loyalty, consistency, and high-level performance on both ends of the ice, yet, unlike his teammates. There appears to be no concrete progress in keeping him, this sudden disconnect between player and team suggests something deeper.Whether it's cap flexibility, future planning, or a mutual shift in priorities.The Florida Panthers entered the summer with high expectations and several big names to lock down. Losing Aaron Ekblad would not only be a hit to the roster but also to the team’s identity. As a former No. 1 overall pick and a long-time leader, Ekblad has been synonymous with the Panthers’ rise in recent seasons.Chris Johnston’s revelation has reset the narrative. The idea of Ekblad staying on a hometown discount no longer feels guaranteed. With no formal offer known to be on the table and free agency fast approaching, Florida may soon have a massive void to fill. Ekblad’s next move could become one of the biggest headlines of this offseason.Also read: Don Cherry ends Grapevine Podcast and career at 91 with final “toodaloo” as legendary hockey broadcaster ends iconic run","The Florida Panthers may be on the verge of losing one of their most reliable cornerstones.

Florida Panthers facing tough offseason decisions

Brad Marchand adds leadership and a winning formula



Brad Marchand made headlines during the Florida Panthers’ Stanley Cup parade, but not just for celebrating a championship. The 37-year-old veteran dropped a subtle yet revealing joke that could speak volumes about his plans for the future. While addressing the crowd, Marchand mentioned teammate Sam Bennett in a way that caught attention across the league.Given how effective both Marchand and Bennett were throughout the postseason, it’s easy to see why the Panthers would want to retain them. Marchand scored 10 goals and racked up 20 points in 23 playoff games, with six of those goals coming during the Stanley Cup Final. His role was critical to Florida’s back-to-back championships. Further solidifying his place as a perfect fit in their lineup.Despite the mutual desire between Brad Marchand and the Florida Panthers to continue their partnership. The reality of the NHL salary cap could complicate matters, both Marchand and Sam Bennett are unrestricted free agents, and re-signing them won’t come cheap. The Panthers are already tight on cap space, which means general manager Bill Zito must get creative.But in today’s cap-driven league, fit alone doesn’t guarantee a contract. As the free agency period approaches, Zito must weigh short-term success against long-term flexibility.Beyond his scoring ability, Brad Marchand brought something intangible. Yet invaluable to the Florida Panthers, a winning mentality, at 37, his presence in the locker room, leadership on the ice, and competitive fire gave the Panthers an edge that numbers alone don’t capture.His playoff performance proved that age has not slowed him down. With nearly a point per game and relentless energy in high-stakes situations, Marchand not only fit the Panthers' system, but he elevated it. That level of impact is hard to replace, especially for a team with legitimate championship ambitions.Whether or not both Marchand and Sam Bennett return next season, their connection and Marchand’s parade joke will be remembered as more than just humor. It was a glimpse into a veteran’s commitment to a team that may have become his new home.Also Read: NHL trade news: New York Rangers confirm they are trading 2025 12th overall pick to Pittsburgh Penguins","Brad Marchand made headlines during the Florida Panthers' Stanley Cup parade.

Pant scored twin centuries in the match.""Yes, from a batting point of view, it's disappointing because, in the first inning, we lost seven wickets on 40 runs and six wickets on 30 runs in the second inning. When we had the opportunity to make around 600 runs in the first inning, we were in a situation where we could have dominated,"" Gambhir said.""But again, these things happen. So, hopefully, we can learn in the second test match. But the good thing was that we had opportunities all four or five days where we could have dominated this Test match,"" he added.Jaiswal would possibly be remembered for the catches dropped in this Test. He led the team in the chances squandered with four drops - Ben Duckett, Ollie Pope, Harry Brook and again Duckett.In the process, these four England batters scored 165 runs more than what they should have.India head coach Gautam Gambhir, though, defended the team for the catches that were not plucked. ""Catches do get dropped. The best fielders have missed catches. None of them did it on purpose,"" Gambhir told reporters while reflecting on the dropped chances.India dropped 10 catches at Headingley, their most in a men's Test since November 2011 (also 10 drops vs West Indies). This is as many as their last six Test matches combined.","India suffered a 5-wicket defeat against England in the first Test of the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy. Among things that didn't go India's way was the 10 catches dropped, and the batting collapse across both innings. India dropped 10 catches at Headingley, their most in a men's Test since November 2011 (also 10 drops vs West Indies).","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122061038,imgsize-21490,width-400,resizemode-4/122061038.jpg"

Poll What do you think was the biggest factor in Prithvi Shaw's decline? Poor choices and distractions Lack of discipline and fitness Loss of passion for cricket

India Outplayed at Headingley | England Go 1-0 Up in the Series | IND vs ENG 1st Test

NEW DELHI: Once touted as the next big thing in Indian cricket Prithvi Shaw has made a frank and emotional admission about the struggles that have derailed his once-promising career.In a recent interview, the 25-year-old revealed how poor choices, distractions, and a shift in priorities led to his decline, both on and off the field.“There are a lot of things. It is different for people to see. Because I know what has happened. I can understand it. I have taken a lot of wrong decisions in life. I started giving less time to cricket. I used to practice a lot. For example, I used to bat for 3-4 hours in nets. I never got tired of batting. I used to go to the ground for half a day. I admit that there was a distraction,” Shaw told News24.“After that, I started considering what was not necessary as necessary. I made some wrong friends. Because I was at the top at that time. Friendship is also formed. Then they took me here and there. All those things. Then I got away from the track. I used to give 8 hours of practice on the ground. Now it is 4 hours.""Shaw, who made a dream Test debut in 2018 with a century against the West Indies, quickly rose to fame, even drawing comparisons with the likes of Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag.But over time, lapses in disc ipl ine and fitness saw him fall out of favour.From being dropped by Mumbai for poor fitness to going unsold in the IPL 2025 auction, the downturn was steep and public.Now, the right-handed opener is looking to reset.Shaw has officially parted ways with the Mumbai Cricket Association, seeking a fresh start with Maharashtra as a professional player.In his letter to the MCA, Shaw expressed gratitude for their support but said he believes a move is necessary for his growth.While he made brief comebacks, including a stint in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, consistent performances remained elusive.With a new state team, a renewed mindset, and honesty about his past missteps, Prithvi Shaw is aiming to turn the page.Whether this marks the beginning of a redemption arc or a slow fade from top-tier cricket remains to be seen; but for now, he’s choosing the hard road back.","Prithvi Shaw has made a frank and emotional admission about the struggles that have derailed his once-promising career.

Angel Reese ignites NBA draft buzz by calling Derik Queen “Baby Jokic” in bold comparison,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/angel-reese-ignites-nba-draft-buzz-by-calling-derik-queen-baby-jokic-in-bold-comparison/articleshow/122076609.cms,"Images via Getty Images

Angel Reese ’s “Baby Jokic” nickname throws Derik Queen into the NBA draft spotlight

In a world where basketball nicknames carry weight, being dubbed “Baby Jokic” is no small compliment. That label now belongs to Derik Queen, the Maryland standout whose passing skills and court feel have drawn early comparisons to Denver Nuggets superstar Nikola Jokic. But what makes this nickname even more intriguing is who gave it to him—Angel Reese, the WNBA’s rising star and former Maryland and LSU sensation. Their connection, while not by blood, runs deep through the shared hardwood of College Park.While some fans have wondered if Derik Queen and Angel Reese are related, they’re not, however, their bond was born through Maryland basketball. Reese, now a forward for the Chicago Sky , remains a proud alum of the Terrapins program—and for good reason. Her younger brother, Julian Reese , was Queen’s teammate during Maryland’s latest NCAA campaign.It was during that season that Queen began making noise, especially after a highlight-worthy buzzer-beater in the NCAA Tournament. That play, and others like it, earned praise from Reese, who dubbed him “Baby Jokic” for his skill set and poise on the court. She commented earlier this year during an interview in Chicago, saying Queen’s playmaking “reminded her of Jokic ” and that he “sees the game two steps ahead.”But as promising as the nickname is, Queen’s leap to the NBA isn’t without questions.His passing ability is elite, and his decision-making on the floor mirrors that of top-tier pros. But the one swing skill? Shooting.If Queen can develop a consistent range, he could carve out a unique role in the league. Without it, scouts believe he may still thrive as a player similar to Houston Rockets center Alperen Sengun —a solid big with high IQ, but with limitations in today’s pace-and-space game.Also Read: Angel Reese gives emotional shoutout to Lisa Leslie after win and breaks silence on their bond The nickname may be playful, but it carries the weight of expectation. As Derik Queen steps into the next chapter of his basketball journey, his roots at Maryland and the confidence of someone like Angel Reese offer a strong foundation. If he delivers, “Baby Jokic” could become more than a nickname—it might be a preview.",Derik Queen has been dubbed “Baby Jokic’ by WNBA star Angel Reese. Reese and Queen were teammates at Maryland during the 2014-15 season. Queen has drawn comparisons to Denver Nuggets star Nikola Jokovic.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122076614,imgsize-1211195,width-400,resizemode-4/122076614.jpg"

Ryan Kalkbrenner Could Be PERFECT MATCH for Celtics: ""There is a Ton of Smoke""

The NBA draft is about to start. All team owners have their eyes on the prospects. They chase the game-changers, the players with character in their performance. Also, they want the best pick at a reasonable price. In the current set of prospects, Cooper Flagg is ruling the popularity chart. He is being deemed safest by the game experts. He has a few more companions on the safest draft picks’ list.Let’s find out who they are and why they are considered draft picks with a high floor.The buzz around Cooper Flagg being the safest draft pick has been the most prominent this year. And why would it not be? Cooper brings to the table a rare combination of high floor and high ceiling. It means a safe player with excellent tools at hand.Duke Blue Devils freshman turned heads with his stellar performance. He made the mark with 19.2ppg on average. His phenomenal court dominance earned him the recognition of National Player of the Year, too.Since April 2025, when he declared himself for the draft, Cooper has been a topic on all platforms where basketball is discussed.Kon Knueppel serves as a safe option owing to his ability to score from all three levels - deep, midrange, and rim.His elite shooting and exceptional basketball IQ make him an error-proof player.Standing at approx. 6”7”, he makes a suitable choice for the third and fourth positions. His ability to step in and perform whenever needed complements the NBA environment perfectly.A staggering 91.4% success in the free-throw line as a Duke Blue Devils pivot earned him praises from Copper Flagg, too. For his positional size and mechanics, scouts placed him high among the safest draft picks of 2025.Bursting with energy and supported by strong athleticism, Carter Bryant makes the good books of league owners. When it comes to a safe draft pick, he makes a unique choice because of a lack of star power, but a lot of promise.Bryant is considered a high-floor player because of his versatile play. He can fit into any of the positions like a glove and make an impact.Though Bryant shows scope for improvement in scoring ability, his versatile defense fills the gap. Compared to OG Anunoby, Patrick Williams, and Trey Murphy III by the analysts, the player aptly fits the role of 3-and-D-wing (3-pointer and defense).V J Edgecombe checks most of the boxes as a safe draft pick. His strength lies in being the elite perimeter defender. Noticeable performance statistics, such as 3.8% steal rate and 2.3% block rate, make him a solid case for one of the safest draft picks.According to NBA Draft Scouting Reports & Analysis’s records, his excellent leaping helped him score 33 dunks in his freshman season. Defense is the trump card of Edgecombe, where he excels with good anticipation and disruptive turnovers.The Baylor freshman has decent numbers to support his reputation as a safe draft pick. He scored a 50.4% effective FG rate, which is comparable to several long-term NBA players. Edgecombe got the selector’s attention with his 30-point performance against Kansas State.With virtues like consistency, athleticism, and strong defense, Edgecombe justifies being one of the safest 2025 draft picks.Ryan Kalkbrenner emerged as one of the top finishers and defenders in the NCAA Division 1. His growing reputation as an experienced college basketball upperclassman made him a safe pick for the 2025 draft.Having five years of experience in college basketball, he has outgrown the status of an untested freshman. His experience brought the surety that scouts needed in a draft pick.The four-time Big East Defensive Player of the Year has physical attributes that make him an elite choice for defensive roles on the team. An exemplary wingspan of 7’6″ and 9’4″ reach provides him the impetus needed for foul-less defense.Also Read: “I’m not worried” - Cooper Flagg gives his honest thoughts on succeeding Luka Doncic in Dallas Mavericks roster The 2025 NBA Draft picks’ list indeed demonstrates immense potential.

India Outplayed at Headingley | England Go 1-0 Up in the Series | IND vs ENG 1st Test

Poll Do you believe Rishabh Pant is revolutionizing Test cricket with his batting style? Yes No, not really

Former India coach and Australia cricketer Greg Chappell has heaped praise on Rishabh Pant after the wicketkeeper-batter’s record-setting twin hundreds at Headingley, calling him a game-changer and comparing his impact to that of Australian great Adam Gilchrist.Pant, now India’s Test vice-captain, became only the second wicketkeeper-batter in history after Zimbabwe’s Andy Flower to score a century in each innings of a Test match. His explosive batting was one of the standout performances in the series opener at Headingley, even though India fell by five wickets to the hosts on Day 5.“The beauty of it (Pant’s batting) is that he gets his runs at a very fast rate, which gives you time to win cricket matches. It was a phenomenal performance; some of the shots that he played probably weren’t in the MCC coaching manual when I last looked at it,"" Chappell said at an event in Mumbai.Chappell believes Pant is revolutionising Test batting with a fearless approach that makes the best use of modern bats and the 27-year-old's vey own natural flair.“He is reinventing the game as a batter. You know, modern technology, the bats are very different.You can play shots that weren’t possible with the old bats. But man, he’s exciting to watch,” he added.Pant’s ability to keep bowlers guessing also impressed Chappell. “You never quite know what to expect from the first ball at any stage. He’s likely to jump down the wicket to the pacers, or he’ll play the falling ramp shot. You never quite know what to expect, so it keeps the opposition on their toes,” he explained.Recalling his early impressions of the left-hander, Chappell said, “When I first saw him, he was a different sort of player, of course, but he reminded me very much of Adam Gilchrist.”Pant’s twin hundreds also saw him rise to a career-best seventh in the ICC Test rankings for batters. India will look to make the best use of his explosive form in the second Test set to commence on July 2. A win would bring the visitors level in the series.",Former India coach Greg Chappell has heaped praise on Rishabh Pant. The wicketkeeper-batter scored twin centuries against England at Headingley.

No Taylor Swift in the spotlight, but Travis Kelce shines solo

Travis Kelce’s spontaneous bar takeover gets the crowd hyped



Kansas City Chiefs’ star tight end Travis Kelce once again proved he doesn’t need the spotlight to find him—he creates it. During the annual Tight End University party in Nashville, Kelce took center stage at a buzzing local bar and delivered an impromptu performance that had fans screaming, cameras flashing, and the energy dialed all the way up.While many in the crowd may have hoped to catch a glimpse of Taylor Swift at the event, it was Kelce who stole the night with his spontaneous charm. Reports confirm the power couple arrived at the event together earlier in the evening, but during the bar performance, Swift was elsewhere enjoying the festivities in a more relaxed setting.And that’s exactly what made the moment feel authentic—Kelce wasn’t trying to steal headlines or spark gossip. He was just having fun, surrounded by his fellow tight ends like George Kittle and Greg Olsen, and letting loose the way only he can.With no prior announcement or musical act planned, Kelce casually made his way to the stage, grabbed the mic, and let his personality take over. Eyewitnesses said the crowd’s reaction was immediate. “The bar lit up as soon as he started,” one fan said, as cheers erupted and phones went up to capture the moment.This wasn’t a celebrity trying to show off—it was a natural entertainer feeding off the energy of the room. There were no gimmicks, no red carpet flashbulbs—just Kelce with a drink in hand, enjoying his night and making it memorable for everyone there.While Swifties were undoubtedly curious about her absence from the stage, the evening showed that Kelce can carry the crowd all on his own.

Why does the NBA league commissioner get booed?

Who is Adam Silver?

All you need to know about the draft

Fans booing NBA Commissioner Adam Silver at the draft is no secret. Every time the NBA Draft rolls around and Silver steps onto the stage, the boos begin. It’s become something of a tradition. With the 2025 NBA Draft set to take place on Thursday night at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York, that tradition is expected to continue. But have you ever wondered why he receives such treatment from fans every time he appears?According to reports, the crowd often sees the commissioner as the “fall guy.” He’s blamed for everything that goes wrong in the league — from trades and team relocations to rule changes and controversial draft picks. People think he is behind rigging drafts and blame him for everything from player injuries due to too many matches to trades that do not win the approval of the fans.So whenever the NBA Commissioner appears, the fans respond with boos — a vocal show of disapproval. The exact origin of this tradition remains unclear. No one really knows when or why it started.So when Adam Silver walks onto the stage at Barclays Center on Thursday night, expect fans to boo the league's top executive once again.The draft will begin at 8 PM ET (Thursday 5:30 AM IST).Silver joined the NBA in 1992 and has held several key positions, including NBA Deputy Commissioner and Chief Operating Officer, President and COO of NBA Entertainment, NBA Chief of Staff, and Special Assistant to the Commissioner. He was appointed league commissioner on February 1, 2014.The excitement is buzzing ahead of the NBA Draft, which is now just a few hours away. The draft will feature top prospects, including Duke’s Cooper Flagg, who is expected to be the No. 1 pick by the Dallas Mavericks. Alongside Flagg, other highly rated names like Duke’s Kon Knueppel, Khaman Maluach, Georgia’s Asa Newell, and Maryland’s Derik Queen are also expected to be among the top picks.Also Read: Where to watch the 2025 NBA draft- Date, time, streaming details and more In the first round, teams will have just five minutes to make their selections.

Surrendering is nothing new in titles like Marvel Rivals. Every multiplayer title these days usually contains this feature in order to cope up with the toxic teammates or smurf accounts. It not only saves you from utter humiliation, it also saves your Rank Points.Now, surrendering is not an unknown process to the Marvel Rivals fans as the game has been in the scene for over half-a year now. But the upcoming patch in the game is bringing some changes in the surrendering mechanism. And that’s where this guide comes in.Marvel Rivals players are recently having some serious troubles with smurf accounts in the game. High-skilled players are actually playing with low-ranked accounts, which is absolutely disrupting the gameplay experience.And who hasn’t faced the massacres by throwers and toxic teammates, who ruin the whole match going against their teammates. Amidst such situations, surrendering is the best bet to save the players from a devastating gaming encounter.However, previously in Marvel Rivals, it wasn’t that easy to surrender a match because it needed the majority of the votes from the team to surrender a match.That is why, on many occasions players had to continue the match despite having a toxic player on their side or a smurf account in the opponent team.But that isn’t going to be a problem anymore as NetEase Games is about to change how surrendering works in the game. The developers are going to release a new update on June 26, 2025, which will have a surrendering rework.After this update, required votes to surrender a match will be decreased. For an example: in a match if a team has 5 players and one of them has left the game, then among the remaining 4 players, only 3 votes will be needed to surrender that match.This is actually a great approach from the developer to save the players from being humiliated by throwers and smurfs. But this can also lead some players from leaving matches early in tough situations to save their ranks , making the ranked gameplay system a bit more casual","There is a new change in the surrendering process in Marvel Rivals.

Deebo’s role solves Washington’s YAC struggles



Jayden Daniels and J.J. McCarthy confidence levels 🧐 | NFL Live

Jayden Daniels already sees explosive potential



The Washington Commanders are reloading with rookie quarterback Jayden Daniels at the center of their offensive rebuild — but it’s Deebo Samuel who may quietly become the key. With one of the league’s worst yards-after-catch (YAC) metrics in 2024, Washington needed a dynamic playmaker in space. Samuel’s arrival offers that and more, providing the spark they lacked last season. Now, expectations are soaring for a breakout 2025 tandem.While the Commanders ranked top five in most offensive categories last year, they were shockingly low in one key area — 21st in YAC per reception. NFL analyst Mina Kimes highlighted this flaw and pointed straight to Samuel as the solution. “The Commanders offense was top five in just about every metric last year but one where they were not was yards after the catch per reception,” she said.She followed with a now-viral phrase: “By God, that's Deebo Samuel's music. That's exactly what he's been brought into this offense to do.” Kimes believes Samuel’s unique ability to generate big gains on short throws is exactly what this team lacked. “You can see him certainly taking advantage of that to get them yards after the catch,” she added.Jayden Daniels is fully on board with the vision — and his excitement is crystal clear.When asked about Samuel, the rookie QB didn’t hesitate: “An 80-yard touchdown on a screen — that’s what I see.” Daniels’ quick-passing game aligns perfectly with Deebo’s YAC-heavy style. The chemistry between them is already generating buzz across the league.Kimes also emphasized this synergy: “I think he brings an element to this offense that didn’t exist last year.” With Terry McLaurin stretching the field and Jahan Dotson creating separation underneath, Samuel adds the crucial third piece — a bulldozing, open-field playmaker. The offensive balance could be unlike anything Washington has had in years.Also read: Russell Wilson’s wife Ciara stuns in fiery dance collab with DK Metcalf’s fiancée Normani In 2021, Deebo Samuel exploded for 1,405 receiving yards, 6 touchdowns, and 365 rushing yards — a historic dual-threat season. Although his production fell to 670 yards in 2024, Washington is banking on a fresh start. Under Kliff Kingsbury’s motion-heavy system, Deebo may finally return to elite form. If so, this Commanders offense could become one of the most dangerous in the NFL.","The Washington Commanders are reloading with rookie quarterback Jayden Daniels at the center of their offensive rebuild.

Gavaskar on Sai Sudharsan and Karun Nair

Poll Will India's middle order improve in the next Test? Yes, they will bounce back. No, they will struggle again.

Following India’s five-wicket loss to England in the Leeds Test, Sunil Gavaskar has called for immediate changes to the playing XI, with spinner Kuldeep Yadav at the forefront of his suggestions. The former India captain believes Kuldeep should replace Shardul Thakur for the upcoming second Test in Birmingham, citing conditions likely to assist wrist spin.“Whether Jasprit Bumrah is fit or not, I think Kuldeep Yadav has to come into the team. I do believe that he should come into the team for Shardul Thakur because the Birmingham pitch will be one where there will be just a little bit of help for the wrist spinner,” Gavaskar said on Tuesday while speaking on broadcast.Thakur, playing his first Test in over two years, failed to make a significant impact. He bowled just six overs in the first innings for 38 runs without a wicket and managed only five runs across both innings. Though he did provide a brief spark in the second innings with the ball, dismissing Ben Stokes and Harry Brook off consecutive deliveries, Gavaskar felt his overall performance wasn’t convincing enough.The leg-spinner Kuldeep Yadav, meanwhile, has played just one Test in England — at Lord’s in 2018 — where he went wicketless. Despite that, Gavaskar believes his variation could be vital in Birmingham.Gavaskar also addressed concerns over the middle order, particularly debutant Sai Sudharsan and Karun Nair, both of whom were dismissed for ducks in the first innings at Headingley, triggering a collapse from a strong 430/3 to 471 all out.While he isn’t in favour of dropping them just yet, Gavaskar hinted at a possible reshuffle if India go 0-2 down.“If things don't go well in the second Test, maybe Sai (Sudharsan) and Karun (Nair). I don't want to drop them at the moment. Then I'd also look at Washington (Sundar), so that it really gives you a more solid batting, and also get a little more variety as far the bowling is concerned,” he said.After the painful loss to England at Headingley on Day 5, India will look to level the series when they face England at Edgbaston starting July 2.","Kuldeep Yadav should replace Shardul Thakur for the second Test, says Sunil Gavaskar.

Gautam Gambhir Explosive Press Conference: On Drop Catches, Batting Collapse, Shubman Gill Captaincy

Former India off-spinner R Ashwin has requested Team India coach Gautam Gambhir and captain Shubman Gill to have a word with Rishabh Pant ahead of the second Test against England, to be played in Birmingham starting July 2.Rishabh Pant had an excellent outing with the bat in Leeds, where the wicketkeeper-batter slammed centuries in both innings. But his heroics were not enough, as India lost the Test by five wickets.""Rishabh had a fabulous game as a batter. I would like to repeat that Rishabh has got a great defence. There is not a single shot in the book that he cannot play,"" Ashwin said on his YouTube channel Ash Ki Baat.However, Ashwin had one suggestion for Pant — that next time when he crosses 100, he should try and convert it into a double century.""I sometimes feel if I were Gautam Gambhir or Shubman Gill, I would take Rishabh Pant aside and say, ‘(Brother, you’ve batted brilliantly). I would love to be a batter with the kind of ability you have. But can I request you to make a double hundred next time when you're batting on 130?"" said Ashwin.""You know we won’t get much contribution from the lower order, so please take the team to the last wicket. But what a fabulous batsman, what a fabulous cricketer, what a talented player,"" he added.India head coach Gautam Gambhir, however, seemed in no mood to laud individual brilliance, like Pant’s twin hundreds, when asked about the positives from the opening Test loss to England, saying everything boils down to results — which his team could not achieve.Never one to mince words or hide disappointment, Gambhir offered a rather blunt response to a question on Pant’s efforts that ultimately could not tilt the game in India’s favour.""There are three more centuries as well. Those are big positives too. Thank you,"" was his one-line answer to a pointed question on Pant.When pressed further on the overall positives, Gambhir said, ""I would have liked if you said there was a hundred from Yashasvi (Jaiswal), a hundred from Shubman (Gill) on debut as captain, a hundred from KL (Rahul), and two centuries from Rishabh. So, five centuries in a Test match is a great start, to be honest.

While one was growing up, one's mother often lamented that if one spent as much time poring over textbooks as one did perusing the collective works of Frederick Forsyth, one might have amounted to something worth writing about—instead of writing about worthless things. Tautologies masquerading as jokes aside, Britain, too, has long mastered the art of making its hypocrisy sound like high wit.TakeThere’s a hilarious episode where Jim Hacker and Sir Humphrey Appleby team up to pressurise adirector into pulling an embarrassing interview. Theman initially refuses—until Sir Humphrey gently reminds him that failure to cooperate might result in budget cuts and, more scandalously, the loss of seats at Wimbledon and Royal Ascot. They all then solemnly agree that while themustn’t appear to give in to government pressure, they won’t air the interview due to “security implications.”The brilliance of the scene lies in how comfortable the British—for all their lack of tastebuds—are with poking fun at the very institutions they hold dear. A taxpayer-funded broadcaster that can satirise both the government and itself without missing a beat.But—as brilliant as it is—is perhaps only thesecond greatest contribution to the literary arts.The top spot, without contest, belongs to a former Royal Air Force pilot with an eye for detail and a knack for turning geopolitical chaos into page-turning precision: Frederick Forsyth, who departed for Elysium on June 9.And here’s the kicker: Forsyth might never have become an author at all had it not been for the BBC.Fate—disguised as institutional cowardice—had to intervene so that he could stumble into his true dharma.The story goes that once his flying days were over, Forsyth joined, before moving on to the Beeb.However, disgusted by the BBC’s denial of genocide—a custom in which Albion has shown considerable promise—during the Biafra War, Forsyth quit and began covering the conflict as a freelancer.Freelancing, as every freelancer worth her salt will tell you, leads to penury.Broke, and living on a friend’s sofa he wrote the first manuscript of the book that came to be known asostensibly within only 35 days.was initially rejected because it dealt with a rather sticky subject – the attempted murder of a very much alive Charles De Gaulle – not to mention that the cold, journalistic style of writing, lack of a traditional Herculean hero, overt detailing, and a plot whose ending was preordained.The rest as they say is history.sold over 10 million copies, become the inspiration for two movies, and a race-swapped limited series, but to reduce Forsyth’s legacy tois like calling Bob Dylan merely the poet who wroteIt’s simply one arrow in a quiver full of masterpieces.Forsyth was a masterful storyteller, an author who brought a journalist’s eye-for-detail with a poet’s gift for storytelling without getting into the literary quagmire of a John Le Carre that could alienate those with more limited grasp of the King’s.In fact, today, it’s almost hard to explain to a generation that has grown up on C-Bag, Instagram reels or TikTok videos, the magic that Forsyth produced on his vintage Olympia typewriter (he used them till his death).His attention to detail was legendary and reading his novels wasn’t just a walk through a story but a tour through space-time, a history lesson more enthralling than anything in one’s textbook.Take one’s favouritewhere we move from The Battle of Britain to Vietnam to Milosevic’s Yugoslavia to an unnamed South American republic with dodgy leaders ending on the night of September 10, 2001 with a plot twist that would boggle your mind.In, we meet mercenaries with a plan that it’s almost a CliffNotes on how to carry out aon an African nation. The fact that some mercenaries actually thought they were going to carry out an actual coup bears testimony to its hyperrealism.In, we see the future of Labour politics and Leftism in Britain which will ally with any force inimical to the Western order.In, Forsyth astutely predicts the rise of a Putin-like figure whose expansionist ways will become a threat to Europe if not stopped in time. Unfortunately, Forsyth’s protagonists only exist in the pages of novels whose effete real world versions pale in comparison. Today, as the world grapples with Putin trying to increase his sphere of influence, the book reads like a prophecy.Forsyth’s protagonists are a breed apart—neither the brooding intellectualism of Le Carré’s George Smiley nor the martini-drenched bravado of Ian Fleming’s James Bond. They are men of method, mission, and moral ambiguity—shaped more by bureaucracy and battlefield scars than by tuxedos or existential crises. Take Calvin Dexter, the tunnel rat turned avenger, who channels quiet rage into legal vigilantism, or Cat Shannon, a professional mercenary with a conscience honed in Africa’s cruel geopolitics. Jason Monk, ex-CIA and emotionally flayed by betrayal, stands at the cusp of East-West collapse in Icon.Then there’s Mike Martin, the SAS ghost who reappears across Forsyth’s work—first infiltrating Iraq in, then the Taliban inPaul Devereaux, the cold, calculating CIA man in, is the closest Forsyth comes to a Bond figure—minus the glamour, doubled on ruthlessness.Even the teenage hacker Luke Jennings inis a far cry from traditional spy fiction—a vulnerable savant weaponised by Adrian Weston, a spymaster who knows the game is rigged. They’re professionals in a bureaucratic wilderness, soldiers of shadow wars and moral compromise—proof that in Forsyth’s world, heroism is about precision, not panache.And inForsyth’s memoir is a debrief confirming the many things we already know and a few we didn’t like the fact that he did covert work for MI6, had a dalliance with an East Bloc spy and was part of back-channel talks to de-nuclearise post-Apartheid South Africa.Forsyth’s memoir is not a celebrity confessional—it’s a debrief. He writes of his time as a fighter pilot, his disillusionment with journalism during Biafra, and his covert work for MI6. He describes his writing method with the same precision as his fictional operatives.You finish the book understanding that Frederick Forsyth didn’t write thrillers. He lived them. Then redacted just enough to publish. And in that, Forsyth was a journalist through and through. And maybe reading his books was far more entertaining, if not useful, than reading one’s textbooks.","Frederick Forsyth, a former Royal Air Force pilot with an eye for detail and a knack for turning geopolitical chaos into page-turning precision, died on June 9.

2025 highlights: Familiar faces and dramatic falls



Is it just madness or tradition





Every year on a steep hill in Gloucestershire, England, hundreds gather to chase a rolling 7-pound wheel of Double Gloucester cheese down a dangerously steep slope. Known as the Cooper’s Hill Cheese Rolling Contest, the event is chaotic, absurd, and completely thrilling. With participants tumbling, somersaulting, and crashing their way to the bottom, the headline “People sprint to catch a 7-pound wheel of cheese” is technically accurate, but it doesn’t quite capture the madness, tradition, and injuries that define this bizarre British spectacle. So, is it a good headline? That depends on what you’re hoping to convey.The Cheese Rolling Contest is an annual event held on Cooper’s Hill in Brockworth, Gloucestershire. Dating back at least two centuries, and possibly much longer, the race involves competitors hurtling down a 200-yard slope after a large wheel of cheese. The goal? Be the first to reach the bottom and claim the cheese as a prize. It sounds simple, but the event is notorious for its steep incline, dangerous tumbles, and frequent injuries.The hill is so steep that it's nearly impossible to stay upright. Most participants end up tumbling head over heels, colliding with each other or the ground.Gravity takes over quickly, and the cheese, reaching speeds of up to 70 mph, is almost never actually caught. Still, competitors willingly risk sprains, fractures, and concussions for a shot at glory and a round of cheese.This year, German YouTuber Tom Kopke claimed victory for the second year in a row. Shirtless and triumphant, he declared, “I risked my life for this. It’s my cheese. Back to back.” On the women’s side, Ava Sender Logan from London tumbled repeatedly but emerged victorious, saying, “It felt quite long coming down and then I hit my head. I’m fine.” Around them, spectators packed the woods and fences for a glimpse of the chaos.While the event may seem absurd to outsiders, for locals and returning participants, it’s a point of pride and cultural identity. Despite calls to regulate or cancel it over safety concerns, the contest continues to thrive, drawing international competitors and media attention. Volunteers, medics, and long-time residents treat it as an important local tradition","The Cheese Rolling Contest is an annual event held on Cooper’s Hill in Brockworth, Gloucestershire.

Chinese basketball prospect Yang Hansen joined the Portland Trail Blazers



The Portland Trail Blazers delivered one of the biggest surprises of the 2025 NBA Draft by selecting Chinese center Yang Hansen with the 16th overall pick. In a move that stunned analysts and fans alike, Portland made a trade with the Memphis Grizzlies to acquire the pick, passing on higher-ranked prospects. Hansen, who had been projected as a second-round selection, now becomes the first Chinese-born player to be drafted in the first round since Yi Jianlian in 2007.Yang Hansen, a 7-foot-2 center from the Qingdao Eagles in the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA), heard his name called early. Yet the Trail Blazers saw something others didn’t, trading down from the 11th overall pick to secure him at No. 16. The Grizzlies used Portland’s original pick to select Washington State forward Cedric Coward, while the Blazers took a major swing by grabbing Hansen.Hansen’s resume in China is already loaded. He was named CBA Defensive Player of the Year in 2024, and he earned All-Star honors in both of his seasons with Qingdao. He also captured the Rookie of the Year award in his debut season.Statistically, Hansen averaged 15.8 points, 10.7 rebounds, and 3.5 assists during his two seasons in the CBA. His final year was even more productive, as he put up 16.2 points, 10 rebounds, 2.8 assists, and 2.7 blocks over 53 games, according to RealGM.Despite his accolades, Hansen’s jump to the NBA will come with significant adjustments. While he thrived in China, concerns remain about how he’ll handle the speed, physicality, and skill of NBA-level competition. His perimeter shot is still a work in progress, but there have been flashes of range that give scouts hope he could develop into a stretch big.Still, Hansen's combination of size, vision, and touch has drawn lofty comparisons.

China no. 1 Wei Yi Exclusive: Norway Chess 2025, Indian chess stars & China’s chess culture

Nine-year-old Aarit Kapil from New Delhi's Mayur Vihar achieved a remarkable feat by securing a draw against World No. 1 Magnus Carlsen in an online blitz game during the Early Titled Tuesday competition. The fifth standard student from Somerville School, who began playing chess just four years ago, maintained a winning position against the five-time world champion before time constraints led to a draw on the 49th move.The Titled Tuesday tournament, exclusively open to players with FIDE titles, featured elite grandmasters including Hikaru Nakamura, Fabiano Caruana, and former world champion Vladimir Kramnik. Aarit, a Candidate Master, participated in the online event from his hotel room in Batumi, Georgia, where he is currently competing in the FIDE World Cadets Cup under-10 category.This achievement adds to Aarit's growing list of accomplishments, including becoming the third-youngest player globally to defeat a Grandmaster in classical time control when he won against 66-year-old Raset Ziatdinov of the United States last December.""He was five years old when his elder sister Aarna taught him chess. In one week, he was beating us. Not like I am a serious player - I am the equivalent of a bathroom singer in the sport: a casual player.But we saw his potential, so we got him working with a coach. And in a few days, he won an international online tournament,"" says Aarit's father Vijay to Indian Express.The young chess prodigy dedicates five to six hours daily to the sport under the guidance of IM Vishal Sareen. His parents learned of his achievement when he rushed into the room announcing, ""draw kar diya, Carlsen ko draw kar diya.""The game format allocated three minutes to each player at the start, with a one-second increment per move. By move 25, Aarit held an advantage on the board but faced time pressure with only 31 seconds remaining compared to Carlsen's minute and 25 seconds.Aarit maintained a winning position until move 46, when his clock showed just seven seconds. The game concluded in a draw after 49 moves, with Carlsen ultimately finishing third in the 664-player tournament despite being on vacation with his wife Ella.""Sometimes when he has a bad tournament, we jokingly tell him 'tera chess rukwadenge' (We'll stop your chess). He says, 'jo marzi karlo, chess nahi chhodunga' (Do whatever you can, I won't stop playing chess),"" shares Vijay.""Bas chess hi karta hai. Aur kuch nahi karta. (only chess, nothing else),"" says Vijay, who works as a mutual fund distributor in Delhi. The family is currently seeking sponsors to support Aarit's chess career and enable him to participate in more international events.This performance follows a recent trend of young Indian players challenging Carlsen, coming weeks after 19-year-old Gukesh Dommaraju defeated the Norwegian champion at the Norway Chess tournament.","Nine-year-old Aarit Kapil from New Delhi's Mayur Vihar achieved a remarkable feat by securing a draw against World No. 1 Magnus Carlsen.
