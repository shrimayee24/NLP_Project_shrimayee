Theare facing a challenging situation as they prepare to take on the Miami Heat on Monday night, with star forwarddue to a right patella tendinopathy. Tatum, who recently delivered a stellar 40-point performance against the New York Knicks, is a key player for the Celtics, and his potential absence could significantly impact the team’s performance. Jayson Tatum ’s injury report comes as the Boston Celtics are already dealing with multiple health concerns. Jaylen Brown, another cornerstone of the team, is also questionable due to right knee swelling. Additionally, Jrue Holiday remains out with a right shoulder impingement, while newly acquired Torrey Craig continues his recovery from an ankle injury.Despite the setbacks, the Celtics are coming off a strong win against the Knicks, which helped solidify their position in the Eastern Conference standings. However, facing a revamped Miami Heat squad, which recently traded Jimmy Butler to the Golden State Warriors in exchange for Andrew Wiggins and Kyle Anderson, adds another layer of complexity to the matchup.Jayson Tatum’s determination to play through injuries is well-documented. Tatum famously does not like to sit out of games, suggesting he could still be a game-time decision. However, with the Celtics’ long-term goals in mind, giving him a night off might be a strategic move to ensure his health for the postseason.On the Heat’s side, rookie Jaime Jaquez Jr. is questionable due to illness, while Nikola Jovic is probable to play despite an ankle issue. Dru Smith remains out as he recovers from Achilles surgery.The Celtics’ projected starting lineup reflects their injury woes, with Derrick White, Sam Hauser, Jordan Walsh, Al Horford, and Luke Kornet likely to take the floor. Meanwhile, the Heat are expected to start Tyler Herro , Duncan Robinson, Andrew Wiggins, Kel’el Ware, and Bam Adebayo.Also read: Will Trae Young play tonight against the Orlando Magic?

""Giannis has been outspoken about wanting to see European stars playing in the biggest NBA markets,""

Themay have a long-term master plan in the works, with an eye on signingin 2027 to create an unstoppable duo alongside. This bold strategy is gaining traction as the Lakers continue to build their roster around superstar talent and championship potential.Currently, the Los Angeles Lakers have a dominant pairing in Luka Doncic and LeBron James, with LeBron still performing at an MVP level, despite being 40 years old. Luka, at just 25, is expected to shoulder a lot of the burden for LeBron moving forward, which could give the 40-year-old forward the luxury of playing for a few more seasons. This arrangement not only secures the Lakers’ future, but it opens up the possibility for the team to remain competitive even after LeBron’s eventual retirement.When LeBron eventually steps away, the Los Angeles Lakers are setting themselves up to continue contending by bringing in another star player to complement Luka Doncic . That’s where Giannis Antetokounmpo enters the picture. With a player option for the 2027–28 campaign, the 32-year-old Milwaukee Bucks star can decide to leave the city after a long career if he believes his chances of winning a title are better off elsewhere.says one expert, pointing out that the Los Angeles Lakers could be an ideal destination for the Greek Freak. His potential departure from the Bucks is especially likely if he fails to capture another title, even with the addition of Damian Lillard to the team. By 2027, Giannis Antetokounmpo may feel the time is right to move to a team with a better chance of securing a championship, such as the Lakers.The thought of Giannis Antetokounmpo and Luka Doncic teaming up would be a nightmare for opposing teams. Defensively, Giannis would cover many of the areas where Luka is still developing. Offensively, they would form one of the most dynamic duos in NBA history, with Giannis serving as an elite pick-and-roll threat alongside Luka, who is considered by many to be the greatest pick-and-roll passer of all time.Also read: NBA Trade Deadline News: Milwaukee Bucks land Kevin Porter Jr from Los Angeles Clippers in high-risk, high-reward move A team built around Luka Doncic and Giannis Antetokounmpo, with a solid supporting cast of floor-spacing shooters and defenders, could very well be the best in the league, and it’s a strategy that Los Angeles Lakers GM Rob Pelinka surely has on his radar as he looks to build a future dynasty.","The Los Angeles Lakers are planning a future move to sign Giannis Antetokounmpo in 2027, potentially pairing him with Luka Doncic.

MLB insider claims Mets find José Iglesias 'more valuable player' than Pete Alonso,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/mlb/news/mlb-insider-claims-mets-find-jos-iglesias-more-valuable-player-than-pete-alonso/articleshow/118118026.cms,"José Iglesias via Instagram

MLB Insider John Heyman believes José Iglesias is more valuable player than Pete Alonso

NY Mets Updates: Top Prospect Sproat Lookin' GOOD, Iglesias RETURN Still Possible, Cease TRADE Talks

“José Iglesias was a more valuable player than Pete Alonso last season, posting a larger WAR and wRC in the regular season.”

Are the Seattle Mariners eyeing José Iglesias for the 2025 season?

""The Mariners are all about being reliably decent, so here’s a veteran second baseman who tends to hit OK while playing solid defense. He would add stability to a questionable Mariners infield and improve the bench by freeing Dylan Moore to serve as a super-utility man,""

With the addition of Juan Soto and Pete Alonso taking center stage with his homecoming, the Mets still have a lot to improvise in the team roster for the 2025 season. MLB analysts believe that despite rolling in Pete Alonso for the next season, the Mets need to work on their infielders lineup. This diverts the attention towards their former alum José Iglesias .Amidst the comeback of the polar bear to the Mets clubhouse, a prominent MLB insider claimed that José Iglesias is a more valuable player than Alonso.Recently, MLB insider John Heyman spoke about the New York Mets , Pete Alonso’s comeback, and José Iglesias. The former Mets star is still a free agent and is no less than a hot property for any MLB team for the upcoming season. Heyman even went on to compare the 35-year-old shortstop with the polar bear with respect to their performance in the 2024 season.The MLB insider claimed that Iglesias is a more valuable athlete in comparison to the talented slugger Pete Alonso. He said-Statistically, Iglesias came up with a terrific season with the Mets back in 2024. Reportedly, he has a record of hitting .337/.381/.448 along with the 137 wRC during a regular season, whereas Pete Alonso completed a 118 wRC along with a .217/.318/.507 slash line and he even hit 46 home runs which brought him into the spotlight.With the ongoing trend of comebacks in Major League Baseball, there is a high possibility that the New York Mets might come up with José Iglesias. The Cuban-born-American baseball star is still available as a free agent. Mets fans believe that he should be re-signed by the New York Mets for the 2025 season.With former New York Mets alum José Iglesias still a free agent, the athlete has already become a hotbed of discussion. With the off-season almost coming to an end and the Spring training about to start, the speculations around the Mets approaching Iglesias for yet another season can be possible.According to Chad Jennings of The Athletic, there is a strong chance that José Iglesias might end up winding up with the Seattle Mariners for the upcoming season. Jennings mentioned in an article-With José Iglesias’ proficiency as an athlete and versatility, his entry into any MLB team could enhance the roster. He could be a great fit for any baseball team that is looking forward to enhancing their infield segment for the upcoming season.","MLB Insider John Heyman believes José Iglesias is more valuable player than Pete Alonso.

This comes right after the Super Bowl boo incident, where Swift—who was simply there supporting Travis Kelce—was met with jeers from some fans when shown on the big screen.If you somehow missed the drama, let’s rewind to Super Bowl Sunday. Taylor Swift was at the game supporting her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, as the Kansas City Chiefs faced off against the Philadelphia Eagles. But when her face appeared on the big screen at the Stadium, a section of the crowd erupted in boos.It’s no secret that Taylor has worked with hip-hop artists before (remember herremix with Kendrick Lamar?), but a Travis Scott collab would be next-level unexpected. Fans are already buzzing about what their combined styles would sound like, with some hoping for a-era pop anthem and others imagining a moody, atmospheric banger.Whether or not Swift and Scott hit the studio together, one thing is clear—Travis Scott sees her talent and isn’t afraid to say it.

What Does Psalm 121 Represent and How Is It Relevant To the Super Bowl?

Patrick Mahomes was chasing history for his team at this Super Bowl and despite losing, he seemed pretty grounded. His team Kansas City Chiefs lost to the Philadelphia Eagles and Mahomes came forward to take some accountability for it on social media. The Chiefs were in peak form as they hoped to land a rare three-peat and Mahomes was clearly letting his faith lead him as fans spotted a Psalm 121 wristband on his hand during the game.Psalm 121 is a well-known chapter from the Book of Psalms in the Bible. It is often referred to as the ""The Traveler's Psalm"" because it places trust in God's protection while on a journey, and has the opening line being ""I lift up my eyes to the hills - where does my help come from? My help comes from the LORD, the Maker of heaven and earth.”Psalm 121 is essentially a prayer of assurance that God will always protect and watch over you, and it also promises spiritual safety. Also known as the soldier's psalm, it’s said to have been penned in the camp by David when he was hazarding his life in the high places of the field and trusted God to cover his head in the day of battle.Irrespective of the situation someone is in, the psalm directs and encourages the followers to repose themselves and their confidence in God and commit themselves to his care. David here assures himself of help from God, verse 1, 2. II. He assures others of it, verse 3-8.Mahomes shared a humble message after the team’s loss and impress fans with his grounded reaction. ""I let y’all down today,"" the three-time Super Bowl MVP said. ""I'll always continue to work and try and learn and be better for it."" He further added, ""We will be back.""Mahomes went 21-32 for 257 yards with three touchdowns and two interceptions. His offensive line posed a challenge to him and let him be sacked six times. However, Mahomes refused to throw his teammates under the bus.""You can't be satisfied with just going out there and playing and thinking you're gonna have success year in and year out,"" he said. ""These defenses are going to continue to get better and better, so I have to get better.""","Patrick Mahomes wore a Psalm 121 wristband during the Super Bowl.

So, fans can expect him to play in the starting five for the Mavs. However, his absence from the report does not necessarily guarantee his full participation, as the team has been tight-lipped about his condition. This uncertainty adds to the Mavericks’ growing concerns, with Anthony Davis (groin), P.J. Washington (ankle), and Max Christie (shoulder) all listed as questionable.The Mavericks’ injury woes don’t end there. Caleb Martin (hip) and Dereck Lively (ankle) have been ruled out, while Dwight Powell (hip) and Dante Exum (illness) are day-to-day. These absences could severely impact Dallas’ depth and versatility, especially against a Kings squad that enters the game with a clean bill of health.Sacramento, currently holding a 26-26 record, will look to capitalize on Dallas’ depleted roster. Domantas Sabonis, averaging a double-double with 20 points and 15.5 rebounds over the last 20 games, poses a significant threat, alongside DeMar DeRozan and Malik Monk, who have been consistent offensive contributors.The Dallas Mavericks , sitting at 28-25, have relied heavily on their offensive firepower, ranking 11th in the league with 115.5 points per game. However, their defensive struggles, conceding 113.3 points per game (15th in the NBA), could be exacerbated by the absence of key players.As tip-off approaches at 8:30 PM ET, all eyes will be on Kyrie Irving’s status.

EXCLUSIVE Q&A with Travis Kelce and Livvy Dunne

Olivia Dunne reacts to Paul Skenes making his MLB debut | ESPN MLB

The main reason Olivia Dunne, a social media star and gymnast, chose to support the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl LIX was because of her pounding admiration for Taylor Swift.It was at the Sports Illustrated Super Bowl Party that Dunne revealed her preference for the Chiefs going into the Super Bowl. ""Tomorrow for the game I am rooting for the Chiefs. Unpopular opinion around here, which I've heard a lot about,"" Dunne said. She also expressed her excitement for the game and her first experience attending the Super Bowl. “But I'm very excited and it's my first Super Bowl, so it's gonna be a great time,” she added.When she was asked about her reasons for wishing the Chiefs to secure a historic win, she kept it simple: “I'm a Swiftie…” Her response ties back to the close connection between Chiefs star tight end Travis Kelce and pop sensation Taylor Swift. Although Dunne hasn’t yet met Swift in person, she shared her admiration for the singer. “I have not met Taylor, but I know Travis. We're business partners and he's a great guy,"" Dunne explained. ""And I'm sure Taylor's amazing. I love her.""An athlete, Skenes features as her partner in her Super Bowl itineraries. Currently under the Pittsburgh Pirates baseball team, Skenes made a splendid rookie debut in 2024. Of course, Dunne is beaming bright at all his accolades and achievements, she added, ""It was incredible to watch him do what he does,"" she said about his impressive start to his major league career.Even as the Chiefs tussle with the Philadelphia Eagles for a third consecutive victory in the Super Bowl, it can be presumed that Dunne's support for the team is all thanks to her admiration for both Kelce and Swift. Appearing with Skenes at this event is sure going to be a highlight of their Super Bowl experience as they both share one of the most prominent sports events throughout the year.","Olivia Dunne, a social media star and gymnast, chose to support the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl LIX because of her admiration for Taylor Swift.

is never one to hold back, and after thesuffered a crushing 40-22 loss in, he decided to add insult to injury. While the Chiefs entered the game with hopes of making history as the first team to win three straight Super Bowls , things didn’t go their way. But instead of clowning Travis Kelce for his quiet performance on the field, he went straight for his love life.In a now-viral, thesafety posted a savage message aimed at Kelce:t.”Ouch. If you didn’t catch the shade, Gardner-Johnson was referring to Kelce’s decision to part ways with his longtime ex-girlfriend,, before dating pop superstar Taylor Swift . And let’s just say—fans hadto say about it.The Chiefs' offense struggled all night, and Kelce was nearly invisible, finishing with just four catches for 39 yards. The Eagles’ defense completely shut down Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs’ passing attack, leaving their star tight end frustrated and unable to make an impact.Gardner-Johnson, known for his trash talk on and off the field, took the opportunity to twist the knife. His comment wasn’t about football—it was a direct jab at Kelce’s personal life.For those who don’t follow Kelce’s love life, he anddated for about five years before breaking up in 2022. Not long after, Kelce andbecame one of the most talked-about couples in the world. While Swift has been a staple at Chiefs games all season, not everyone has been a fan of their relationship. Some have even speculated that Kelce hasn’t been the same dominant player since the romance started.As expected,exploded with reactions:Kelce hasn’t responded, and let’s be real—he probably won’t. But one thing’s for sure:knows how to keep things spicy, even in the offseason.Also read - Super Bowl 2025: Jalen Hurts’ ‘Unbannable’ Cleats Steal the Spotlight Before Super Bowl LIX Revenge Win","The Chiefs lost 40-22 to the Eagles in Super Bowl LIX.

Did Blake Lively intentionally ditch the Super Bowl to avoid distracting Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce amid her ongoing lawsuit?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/did-blake-lively-intentionally-ditch-the-super-bowl-to-avoid-distracting-taylor-swift-and-travis-kelce-amid-her-ongoing-lawsuit/articleshow/118118758.cms,"Image via Getty Images

Blake Lively reportedly intentionally skipped the Super Bowl

Blake Lively and Taylor Swift have been close friends for years, but they are currently at odds due to a legal battle between Lively and her co-star Justin Baldoni, who is suing her for $400 million in a defamation lawsuit. Swift is reportedly unhappy with Lively for involving her in her legal troubles, as it was claimed Lively used her friendship with the singer to pressure him into making unapproved edits to their film.Blake Lively and Taylor Swift are reportedly rumored to be in a rift due to Lively's alleged omission of Swift to Super Bowl 2025, raising concerns about their friendship. Lively's legal dispute with co-star Justin Baldoni may be affecting her relationship with Taylor Swift, as reports suggest she included Swift's name in the legal battle, complicating matters.Swift did not invite Lively to the Kansas City Chiefs vs. Philadelphia Eagles game, but an insider claims she had no intention to attend even if invited. Lively, a prominent figure at last year's Super Bowl, accompanied Swift and her friends in a VIP suite at Allegiant Stadium, but things seem to have changed in 2025.Lively intentionally skipped the Super Bowl LIX to avoid distracting Swift and her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, from her legal controversy. “Taylor is not shading Blake [nor] is she trying to teach her a lesson. It isn’t like that. Even if Taylor did invite Blake, Blake would not come,” an insider explained. The source further added, “She would never want to make Taylor’s big night – where she is going to see the love of her life play in another Super Bowl – about her. Blake would not want to overshadow Taylor ever.”Swift expressed dissatisfaction with being mentioned in Lively's alleged text messages in a countersuit filed by Baldoni, exacerbating the rumors. In the alleged texts, Lively appeared to liken herself to Game of Thrones character Khaleesi, saying, “If you ever get around to watching Game of Thrones, you’ll appreciate that I’m Khaleesi, and like her, I happen to have a few dragons.”Blake Lively's ""dragons"" in the messages are speculated to be her husband, Ryan Reynolds, and Taylor Swift. A source close to Swift claimed, “Taylor really wishes Blake hadn’t dragged her into this whole situation.” Tensions between Swift and Lively are escalating, despite their long-standing friendship. Swift values her relationship with Lively and is reportedly aiming to move past the controversy.Also Read: “That's very frustrating”: FOX Reporter Erin Andrews suggests avoiding solo Super Bowl viewing at a bar","Blake Lively and Taylor Swift are rumored to be in a rift due to Lively's alleged omission of Swift to Super Bowl 2025.

Indian tennis

looks to a 15-year-old now

PUNE: A little over two years ago, Maaya Rajeshwaran Revathi lost in straight sets in the quarterfinals of a Grade 3 ITF junior event in Pune. ""I don't lose often. Maybe I will win it next year,"" Maaya, then just 13, had declared. Twelve months later, she did exactly that.Any lingering apprehensions were swept away at last week's Mumbai Open, a WTA 125 event. Unranked a week earlier, the 15-year-old Coimbatore girl now appears on the WTA charts at No. 646, putting her in the top-20 of highest ranking achieved on debut. The list includes Jennifer Capriati, Gabriela Sabatini, Monica Seles and the Williams sisters, among others.The teenager's arrival already spells hope for a beleaguered Indian tennis scene - starved of success, battered by apathy of the officialdom, and a court case against the national body.Imran Mirza, who once famously nurtured a prodigy, is very impressed. ""Her temperament is the most impressive part,"" Mirza, father-coach to Sania, told TOI, ""She seemed very level-headed. That's something one needs to go to the highest level.""We put a lot of pressure in India. With Sania, that was one thing we had to always control, the kind of external pressure there was,"" explained Mirza. ""There's already so much excitement with that one performance. She has a long way to go. We have to make sure she's not pressured into thinking that she's the only (one).""According to Imran, Maaya's parents - father Rajeshwaran who deals in procurement of construction raw materials, and mother Revathi, who co-owns a small business - are best placed to nurture her temperament. ""A child is bothered about what the parents think, not what the whole world thinks. Once the fear of losing comes in, it's very difficult to remove that,"" he said.Maaya's mentality reflects in her aggressive game. Even at 13, she wouldn't hesitate to put away a moonball.Manoj Kumar, coach since she was 10, said, ""We impressed upon her that to compete with the world's best juniors, she needed to be aggressive and at the same time become a bit more consistent.""Kumar underlined that Maaya was yet to complete her junior career. ""She hasn't yet transitioned into the women's circuit. She has done well in one tournament, she needs to do it regularly,"" he said.Transition to the pros has always proved the biggest hurdle in Indian tennis. Maaya seems to come well prepared. A little over five-feet-seven in her shoes, she has a good couple of more years to grow, putting on four kgs of muscle mass over the past year. ""I eat like a beast,"" she said recently.With the Rafa Nadal Academy offering her a one-year scholarship, the Indian is in a group of four players who are monitored by two head coaches and assistants. Last month, Miguel Fragoso accompanied her for junior events in India, but she can also summon the familiarity of Kumar in her corner.While the teenager will continue with schooling in Spain, Imran cautioned against too much tinkering with technique. ""In Europe, most of the training is more suited to the clay-court game,"" he said, ""There can be exceptions, (but) we seem to be more suited to hard courts because we have more skill in our hands, and in our joints than in the feet.""","Maaya Rajeshwaran Revathi, 15, is ranked No. 646 in the WTA rankings. The Coimbatore girl is in the top-20 of highest ranking achieved on debut.

Ranji Trophy: Mumbai take firm control against Haryana,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/ranji-trophy-mumbai-take-firm-control-against-haryana/articleshow/118132541.cms,"Brief scores:

KOLKATA: Allrounder Shardul Thakur continued to make a strong case for a comeback into the national side in red ball cricket by putting up a consistent show in the ongoing Ranji Trophy season.After a player-of-the-match performance in the last match against Meghalaya that saw him claim four wickets in both innings, including a hat-trick, Shardul picked up a six-wicket haul to hand Mumbai a crucial 14-run lead. Opponents Haryana were bowled out for 301 a little after the first-hour's play on Day Three of the quarterfinal match here on Monday. Suryakumar Yadav and Ajinkya Rahane then strengthened the defending champions' grip on the match by putting on a 129-run fourth wicket partnership that propelled Mumbai to 278/4 at stumps, thereby enjoying a commanding 292-run lead.Thakur, who had one scalp on Sunday, claimed all the remaining five wickets as Haryana added only 38 runs in the morning. The pacer first sent back overnight unbeaten Rohit Sharma in the first over of the day and then returned with the second new ball to wrap up the last four wickets to finish with six for 58.""I am always in India contention,"" a confident Thakur said at the end of the day's play. ""Now I have to continue doing the good work,"" the 33-year-old, who has played 11 Tests, added. Thakur played his last Test against South Africa in Centurion in Dec 2023.A day after Rohit Sharma returned among runs by hitting a century against England in the second ODI, India's T20I skipper Suryakumar Yadav followed suit, getting a fluent 70.The middle-order batter opened with a boundary and then played the reverse-sweep to perfection against Jayant Yadav early into his innings. He slowed down a bit after racing to 28 off just 23 balls. At 31, he was dropped at first slip, but Suryakumar soon got going again, playing some well-timed late cuts to reach his first half-century in 14 innings. He pulled seamer Anuj Thakral for six but fell trying to repeat the shot off the very next delivery. His mistimed shot was taken easily by substitute fielder Amit Rana at mid-on as Surya departed for 70 off 86 balls, with the help of eight fours and two sixes.Skipper Rahane, on the other hand, preferred to play a waiting game, putting up a 52-run third-wicket stand with Siddhesh Lad (43) after Mumbai lost both the openers Ayush Mhatre and Akash Anand cheaply before lunch.Rahane reached his third fifty of the season, his second in a row, by pulling Nishant Sindhu over mid-wicket for a boundary and stayed undefeated on 88 off 142 balls, hitting 10 boundaries. He got good assistance from Shivam Dube (batting on 30) as the duo batted out the last 11 overs to keep Mumbai's nose ahead.Mumbai 315 and 278/4 in 67 overs (A Rahane 88*, S Yadav 70) vs Haryana 301 in 84.5 overs (A Kumar 136; Shardul Thakur 6/58)",Allrounder Shardul Thakur takes six wickets to hand Mumbai a 14-run lead.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.
