Travis Kelce: Jason Kelce Calls Out Brother Travis Kelce and Patrick Mahomes for Benefiting From 'Bad Call',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/jason-kelce-calls-out-brother-travis-kelce-and-patrick-mahomes-for-benefiting-from-bad-call/articleshow/117467556.cms,"The NFL playoffs saw drama on and off the field as Jason Kelce criticized a roughing-the-passer call benefiting Patrick Mahomes. Mahomes admitted to exaggerating contact on one play, sparking debate about NFL officiating. The Kelce brothers discussed the incident humorously on their podcast, highlighting the tension between protecting quarterbacks and fair play.

""Can I comment on it, though, right? Of course. I think the second one was completely, just like, absolutley ridiculous, right? I mean he didn't even get touched. I don't know. They just missed it.""

Patrick Mahomes Admits to Sideline ‘Flop’



""I would say that the only one I felt like I probably did too much was the one on the sideline where I didn’t get a flag, and the ref saw it and didn’t throw a flag. And I understood it immediately and know that I probably shouldn’t have done that.""

Travis and Jason’s Playful Debate



“I could see what they saw, but it wasn’t really that much contact. In slow motion, it looked like nothing. It was a bad call.”

The Bigger Picture



The NFL playoffs always bring the drama, and this year’s divisional round clash between the Kansas City Chiefs and Houston Texans was no exception. But it wasn’t just the action on the field making waves—it was the controversial calls that had fans and players talking. Jason Kelce , former NFL center and brother of Chiefs star Travis Kelce , didn’t hold back his thoughts on one call that left viewers scratching their heads.During their podcast New Heights (Ep. 121), Jason Kelce shared his unfiltered opinion on a roughing-the-passer call that seemed to benefit Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes . Jason didn’t mince words:Even when Travis chimed in to defend the call, saying Mahomes was indeed touched, Jason stood firm, calling the contact minimal and the decision by referees overly harsh. This shows the healthy bond the kelce brothers share because all this was happening in a healthy discussion. (Us siblings, could never)While the Texans faced penalties for questionable hits, one play involving Mahomes himself added fuel to the fire. Late in the game, Mahomes scrambled toward the sideline and exaggerated contact by flailing his arms—a clear attempt to draw a flag.The refs didn’t bite, and Mahomes later owned up to his theatrics:The Kelce brothers were candid in sharing their views on the hot topic. On the other hand, Jason had more doubts regarding the call and said it wasn't contact enough to result in a penalty. Their debate brought out the different views of the brothers, which gave fans an interesting view of the situation from both sides of the field.The incident has sparked broader conversations about NFL officiating and the fine line between protecting quarterbacks and letting the game flow naturally. The Chiefs ultimately secured a win, but the debate around these calls will likely linger into the postseason.For now, fans can count on the Kelce brothers to keep the conversation fun and fiery, with their podcast remaining a must-listen for football enthusiasts.Also read - NFL Vet John Spytek Joins Raiders as GM: What’s His Connection with Tom Brady?","The NFL playoffs always bring the drama, and this year’s divisional round clash between the Kansas City Chiefs and Houston Texans was no exception.

Why the Texans Fired Slowik: Offensive Problems



C.J. Stroud’s Decline



Coaching Overhaul in Houston



What's Next for Slowik?



The Future: Texans' Offense Reboot



The news surfaced on January 24, 2025, that was truly shocking, concerning the Houston Texans decision to go with a stunning release of two-season offensive coordinator Bobby Slowik . The bombshell came not so much against a backdrop of disappointment but amid success, particularly by winning the AFC South crown and advancing through to the Divisional Round for the playoffs, however, as one would infer the team kept losing on and off the board at the critical parts of matches on offense that got them feeling concerned.Under Slowik, the Texans' offensive rankings plummeted in 2024, finishing 22nd in total yards and 19th in scoring, compared to their solid performance the previous year. The most glaring issue was the team’s lackluster second-half scoring, averaging just 7.5 points—the lowest in the league.Star quarterback C.J. Stroud, who had a phenomenal rookie year, faced a sophomore slump. His passing yards dropped to 3,727, with 20 touchdowns and 12 interceptions, a stark contrast to his over 4,100 yards and just five interceptions in 2023. Additionally, Stroud was sacked 52 times, pointing to issues with the offensive line and overall game strategy.The Texans didn't stop at firing Slowik. Offensive line coach Chris Strausser was relieved of his duties as well, suggesting a bigger effort to refresh their offensive coaching group. It is evident that the organization wants to regroup and provide Stroud with the tools he will need to succeed in his third season in the NFL.Despite his termination, Slowik's reputation as a strong offensive mind keeps him in the mix for other coordinator positions around the NFL. His past success, especially with Stroud in a record-breaking rookie season, makes him a prime candidate for teams looking for an infusion of offensive creativity.With Slowik and Strausser out of the way, the Texans are preparing for tremendous alterations in their scheme on offense. Of course, the search for a coordinator who can unleash Stroud to his optimal level will ensure protection and boost the team's scoring potential.As the Texans step into 2025, there is clear pressure on them: to get the offense back on track and build a team good enough to make deep playoff runs.Also read - 7 Contract Details That Make Bill Belichick a Top-Paid College Coach: Inside Bill Belichick's $10 Million Salary and 5 Big Bonuses","The Houston Texans fired offensive coordinator Bobby Slowik on January 24, 2025.

fans received disappointing news as star centerhas been officially ruled out for the team’s upcoming matchup against the Cleveland Cavaliers on January 24 at Wells Fargo Center. Embiid, who is dealing with a foot injury, will not be available, further adding to the 76ers' struggles this season.With the Sixers already battling multiple injuries, Joel Embiid's absence leaves a significant gap in both offense and defense. The reigning MVP has been a key player for Philadelphia, averaging 10.4 points and 3.1 rebounds over his last 20 games despite limited action due to recurring health issues. His absence means the team will have to rely heavily on players like Tyrese Maxey and Paul George to carry the load.The Philadelphia 76ers ’ injury list continues to grow, with Joel Embiid joining teammates Jared McCain (meniscus), Caleb Martin (groin), Kyle Lowry (hip), Andre Drummond (toe), and Kenyon Martin Jr. (foot) on the sidelines. With so many key players out, Philadelphia has struggled to find consistency, currently ranking 27th in the league in scoring at 107.5 points per game.One of the biggest concerns for the Philadelphia 76ers is their rebounding deficit. The team averages just 38.9 rebounds per game, the lowest in the NBA, while allowing opponents to grab 44.1 boards per contest. Without Joel Embiid's presence in the paint, those numbers could worsen against a strong Cavaliers squad that ranks 16th in the league in rebounding.Despite these challenges, the Sixers are hopeful that their perimeter game, led by Tyrese Maxey 's impressive 26.8 points per game and 3.4 three-pointers made per contest, can keep them competitive. However, facing a Cleveland team that ranks second in the NBA with 121.7 points per game will undoubtedly be a tough task.The timeline for Joel Embiid’s return remains uncertain, with team officials closely monitoring his condition. In a season filled with ups and downs, Philadelphia's playoff hopes could largely depend on how soon their star big man can return to full strength.Also read: NBA All-Star Weekend Slam Dunk Event: All confirmed participants, streaming details, how to watch, and more Philadelphia 76ers fans will be eagerly awaiting updates on Embiid’s status as the season progresses, hoping to see their franchise cornerstone back on the court sooner rather than later.","Philadelphia 76ers star center Joel Embiid has been ruled out for the team’s upcoming matchup against the Cleveland Cavaliers on January 24.

Travis Kelce always wanted to be like Josh Allen

The Kansas City Chiefs and the Buffalo Bills will add another chapter to their rivalry on Sunday in the AFC Championship game at Arrowhead Stadium. Still going in for the fourth straight game against the Buffalo Bills before facing them, Travis Kelce called Josh Allen maybe the finest quarterback he has ever been ready to play against. He complimented Allen further and really expressed his dream of being the type of player he wished when growing up.Travis Kelce, now dating the world's biggest pop star, has appeared in TV shows and commercials, looks back on his childhood dreams of being like Josh Allen, the former Super Bowl champion. Kelce initially saw himself as a center in the NFL , making big plays with his arm and legs. But he did not possess Allen's arm talent, so a perceptive coach shifted him to tight end, and he has since become one of the best players in the position.""Josh is who I used to dream of being like in the NFL,"" Kelce said of Allen. ""Big athletic quarterback, big arm, being able to be a dual-threat guy. ... His ability to do everything. You can tell he's took the bull by the horns and really been their leader up front and channeled that. Guys come in and out of the building and he's the main piece in there making that thing go. I have so much respect for that guy.”As Kelce shared his praise for Allen he also joked, ""I never had the arm talent that Josh has so they kicked me over to tight end.” Kelce, though not having Allen's strong arm, proved to be quite versatile, tying for 1,523 yards passing with 15 touchdowns and 1,016 running yards as a senior at Cleveland Heights High.Kelce has even had a few chances in games of the NFL. Against the Raiders in a match-up in the 2020 season, he completed a 4-yard pass that gave him a first down. The very next week against Tampa Bay, Kelce was given another chance but came up short when the pass was incomplete.Kelce has made numerous impressive plays, including catching the ball, lateralizing to another player, and watching them take off for more yards, which are close-up moments for Chiefs coach Andy Reid and Kelce's friend Patrick Mahomes.“He does that in practice,” Mahomes said with a smile, “and it started off as kind of a joke, and now it’s kind of become a thing. As long as he completes it, Coach is going to keep letting him do it. But he knows the consequences if he doesn’t.”Also Read: ""I laugh at it”: Travis Kelce says he is not bothered by haters who claim he is too old to play professional football The Chiefs are back in the AFC championship game for the seventh straight season, while the Bills are back for the second time in five seasons and looking to avenge a 2021 loss that set them up for a Super Bowl win.","Travis Kelce says he always wanted to be like Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen.

"$156 Million Contract: Red Sox in Danger of Losing Alex Bregman as Astros' $156,000,000 Bid Takes the Lead!",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/mlb/news/red-sox-in-danger-of-losing-alex-bregman-as-astros-156000000-bid-takes-the-lead/articleshow/117535149.cms,"Karen Warren/Staff Photographer

Astros' Big Move for Bregman



“My thought on the situation: If the Astros truly do have 6-years, $156M on the table again, Alex Bregman will not be coming to Boston. No way they’re beating that by enough to get em to leave. This was the risk the Sox took by playing the waiting game…”

The War for Bregman: Will the Red Sox Counter?

Shaping the Red Sox's Future: What's Next?



The Boston Red Sox have been in a somewhat subdued quiet few years. Since they won the World Series in 2018, they've only been to the postseason one time, so there was a need to perhaps get their roster back into championship shape during the offseason. They went into the offseason with quite the plans of bringing in some fresh talent. But the Dodgers swooped in first, signing many of the top names. Yet there was still one name shining brightly on the free-agent market left—Alex Bregman. And now, it looks like the Red Sox might lose him too.Right after the 2024 season came to a close, Alex Bregman found himself in free agency, prompting a bidding war for the All-Star. Naturally, two top contenders emerged fast: the Boston Red Sox and Bregman's former club, the Houston Astros. These two teams certainly had their hearts set on it, but based on the most recent reports, it appears the Astros may be pulling ahead of the Red Sox with an offer that the Red Sox may struggle to top.That reportedly is what the Houston Astros threw on the table for Bregman: a monster 6-year, $156 million deal. Now that's some serious money and a deal so good that the Red Sox don't know what to do about it. Boston Sports Gordo said in a tweet:While the Red Sox might have had the money to meet the Astros' offer, the question would be whether or not they could entice him enough to make him leave from a place that he already calls home. After bolstering a very good pitching staff with more arms like Aroldis Chapman, Walker Buehler, and Patrick Sandoval, the Red Sox needed another strong addition for their batting line. And as far as getting that kind of player is concerned, Bregman would definitely fit the bill.Houston is being more aggressive with Bregman. Some believe that Jose Altuve has been urging the Astros to make a big offer to bring their star third baseman back. Things are heating up, and now the Red Sox are trying to catch up.As the offseason unfolds, the Red Sox are very strategic in making their moves back into postseason contention. The front office is working hard on securing trades, free-agent signings, and player development to fill key gaps in the team following a turbulent 2024 season. The Red Sox are believed to be looking at outfielders such as Cody Bellinger to bolster their center field position. Tough choices, though, lie ahead for the likes of Alex Verdugo, who has been rather inconsistent.Each decision for the Red Sox will prove vital in their effort to re-establish a well-balanced, competitive roster. Now that the Astros have offered what could keep Bregman off the market, fans anxiously await if the Red Sox will find a way to make a final push for the star player.Also Read: Dodgers Welcome Tanner Scott with $72,000,000 Contract, Wife Maddie Melts Hearts with Emotional Tribute!","The Houston Astros have reportedly offered Alex Bregman a 6-year, $156 million deal.

Ranji Trophy: Sensational Smaran slams double ton against Punjab,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/ranji-trophy-sensational-smaran-slams-double-ton-against-punjab/articleshow/117530198.cms,"(X Photo)

BENGALURU: There is plenty about R Smaran that would endear to selectors and connoisseurs of the game. During the 444 minutes he spent at the crease, he had four occasions to celebrate. The landmarks were significant, both in terms of his fledgling career and for Team Karnataka . Yet, the celebrations were understated.He acknowledged his 50 with a simple lift of the bat and a 'thank you' God skyward-look marked his century.For the double century, the acknowledgement of his team's standing ovation lasted barely 25 seconds. There was no leap in the air, or a fist pump. He remained grounded, much like the person the 21-year-old is. He pours all his energy and enthusiasm into the game, matching bold strokes with deft cover drivers. He makes it look easy.On the muted celebrations, Smaran later said, ""Right from the beginning, I have not been big on celebrations. It's just the way I am.""Over the past year, Karnataka's U-19 and U-23 players have notched up record-breaking innings, starting with Prakhar Chaturvedi's unbeaten 404 in last season's Cooch Behar Trophy final. While the proof of flair has been plenty, Smaran's batting has been an exhibition of talent, technique and temperament.On Friday, he struck a stroke-filled 203 (277b; 25x4; 3x6) to steer Karnataka to a commanding 475 in 122.1 overs. It gave Karnataka a 420-run first innings lead over Punjab on the second day of their penultimate Ranji Trophy league fixture.Staring at a massive deficit, Punjab dug themselves into a deeper hole and were 24/2 in 13 overs at stumps and trailing by 396 runs. Abhilash Shetty and Prasidh Krishna sent back Prabhsimran Singh and Anmolpreet Singh in quick succession, crucial inroads that gave Karnataka a sniff of securing a crucial bonus point which could extend their stay to the knockout rounds of this championship.Smaran began from an overnight 80 and steadily built on that platform, eventually finishing with more than 40% of the runs his side scored. It wasn't easy since Punjab's pacers extracted seam movement early on. But Smaran and his overnight partner Abhinav Manohar (34) settled well.There were no signs of nerves jangling in the 90s, but Smaran got lucky when two edges flew through the slip and gully fielders. And as if to rub it in, he brought up his maiden century - off 120 deliveries - with a lofted shot over the fence.Wickets, though, fell regularly enough at the other end. Manohar, chasing a wide-ish ball from spinner Mayank Markhande (3/53), mistimed it to Ramandeep Singh at covers. Later, all-rounders Shreyas Gopal (31) and Yashovardhan Parantap (26) failed to convert starts, while Prasidh Krishna entertained with a 26-ball 30.Smaran himself was dropped by Sukhdeep Bajwa on 140 at midwicket and he made that lifeline count dearly for Punjab. He moved into the 190s by pulling Jass Inder (3/66) for a six. A cheeky single brought up Smaran's 200, but he fell soon after with Inder knocking back the youngsters off-stump to bring the curtain down on a well-crafted innings.""Once I got a hundred, I knew I had to make it big, because I was the settled batters. It was not so easy for the new batsmen to come in and play,"" said Smaran on his thought process.Smaran, who didn't get off to a good beginning in his Ranji Trophy debut season, has repaid the faith of the team management and made the most of the lifelines offered. The top-order bat, who scored 433 runs in the Vijay Hazare Trophy title triumph, including a century in the final, stated he gained confidence from his performance in the white-ball tournament.""The Vijay Hazare Trophy definitely made a drastic difference to my batting in terms of mindset. I felt confident about my batting, and I was in a good headspace. I just looked to carry on the form and make it big,"" added Smaran.",Karnataka batsman R Smaran scores 203 not out against Punjab. Karnataka lead by 420 runs in their first innings. Punjab trail by 396 runs at stumps on day two of Ranji Trophy match. Smaran scored 433 runs in the Vijay Hazare Trophy title triumph.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117530316,imgsize-37930,width-400,resizemode-4/117530316.jpg"

His absence would be a significant blow to the Memphis Grizzlies, who are already without key players, including Marcus Smart (finger), Cam Spencer (thumb), and Vince Williams Jr. (ankle), all of whom have been ruled out.Despite the uncertainty surrounding Ja Morant’s availability, the Memphis Grizzlies are coming off a solid performance in their last outing against the Charlotte Hornets, securing a 132-120 victory. In that game, Desmond Bane stepped up with a team-high 24 points, while also contributing eight assists and two rebounds.On the other side, the New Orleans Pelicans have their own injury concerns, with key players such as Zion Williamson (illness), Brandon Ingram (ankle), and Herbert Jones (shoulder) already ruled out. Yves Missi and Dejounte Murray are also listed as questionable for the game, which could impact the Pelicans' depth and rotation.The Memphis Grizzlies currently hold a 29-15 record, positioning themselves as strong playoff contenders. However, missing Ja Morant’s scoring and playmaking abilities could pose challenges, especially against a Pelicans team that recently secured an overtime victory against the Utah Jazz.

Jalen Hurts provides a positive update on his knee injury

Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts is to start in the NFC championship game after being fully involved in practice with an injured left knee for the second consecutive day. The Eagles are looking to make the Super Bowl for the second time in three seasons. Hurts, who suffered a sack injury against the Rams, was largely unbothered in the Eagles' ninth game in a row at home, although he threw for only 259 yards and two touchdowns in postseason victories over Green Bay and Los Angeles.Jalen Hurts and the Philadelphia Eagles are now on the brink of securing a Super Bowl victory and yet another NFC title, but this will be tough against the Washington Commanders whom they are very well familiar with as divisional rivals. Jalen Hurts injured his knee in the second half of their divisional round win over the Los Angeles Rams but still remained active throughout the game.On Friday, Hurts reported an improvement in his knee injury over the week, but anticipates wearing a knee brace, indicating some pain he will be managing. This suggests a need for further treatment.“We try to put Jalen in safe situations. We want him to put himself in safe situations,” coach Nick Sirianni said Friday. “We understand that there are a lot of things that Jalen does in the running game that help us run the football. As we go through it, we do whatever we’ve got to do to win the game. But his safety is always at the forefront of our mind.”Eagles listed Hurts as limited on their injury report due to a walkthrough and not full practice. Hurts, who will play against Commanders in the NFC Championship Game, expressed no feeling unlucky or snakebited after four consecutive late-season injuries. “It’s a part of the game,” Hurts said. “It’s a part of the game and whatever comes with that comes with that, you know?He continued, “I told you guys I’ve submitted myself to doing whatever it takes to win and some things come with that. But ultimately just got to make the adjustments you need to make to be able to play at a high level. There won’t be any excuses going in or coming out.”“I’m expecting Jalen to be Jalen,” Eagles star running back Saquon Barkley said Friday. “He’s going to show up for us, he’s going to make plays. He’s a winner. He’s got the ‘it’ factor.”Also Read: Jalen Hurts overcomes knee injury, set to lead the Eagles in Divisional Round against the Rams Despite not being his best in the postseason, Hurts has completed 68% of his passes with two touchdowns, no interceptions, and a 101.6 passer rating.

The Times of India in Melbourne:

After two hours and 36 minutes of breaking down Ben Shelton ’s incendiary play while battling cramps, world No. 1 Jannik Sinner turned to his team when the American’s backhand found the net on match point.Sinner grit his teeth and clenched his fist. It was that kind of a performance.The Italian came through 7-6 (2), 6-2, 6-2, making his second successive final here in a match in which Shelton’s level rode the roller-coaster — the 22-year-old had 55 unforced errors, which shouldn’t sum the match for him, but it does.The first set hit dizzying heights, just as well that the roof on Rod Laver Arena was open. The left-handed Shelton stepped up to the plate superbly, matching the world No. 1 shot for shot, meeting flat with flatter, spin with slice and pace with power.For 71 minutes and 94 points, it was hard to pick the numero uno and the 20th ranked player apart.The 22-year-old American broke early for a 2-0 lead, but the defending champion hit back and levelled at 2-2 even though he looked anything but settled on the court.It was Shelton then who broke in the 11th game and looked set to wrap up the set in the following game with two set points on his serve, but Sinner broke back and took hold of the tie-break and the match.Then, when the top seed jumped to a 4-0 lead in the second set, it showed that Shelton of the sparkling talent was still relatively new in the pro game.Shelton, who had the trainer work on his quads at the end of the second set, had the crowd on his side. From shouts of ‘Come on Shelton! Make America Great Again’, there was fair support for the World No. 1 too, lending to the atmosphere.Shelton had chances to break the Sinner serve in the second and fourth games of the third sets, but it was the Italian, battling cramps, who broke in the fifth game.At the change of ends, Sinner got his hamstring attended to by the physio. Sinner, clearly struggling with movement, decided to swing at everything and broke at love, before serving out the match.","World No. 1 Jannik Sinner beat American Ben Shelton 7-6 (2), 6-2,6-2.

CHENNAI: After laying down a marker in the series opener, India have a spring in their step moving into the second T20I against England on Saturday.India, playing a fearless brand of cricket, have been nearly unstoppable in the shortest format ever since head coach Gautam Gambhir and skipper Suryakumar Yadav joined forces. While Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and South Africa were decimated, England, under their new chief coach-captain combination of Brendon McCullum and Jos Buttler , are making an attempt to crack the Indian T20 code.England gave a poor ac count of themselves when trying to stop the Indian juggernaut in Kolkata, where the Men in Blue strolled to victory. The visitors should dish out a much-improved show in the remainder of the five-match assignment to pose any sort of a challenge to the high-flying hosts, beginning with Saturday’s clash. Here are some of the talking points for the Chennai fixture:Returning speedster Mohammed Shami will once again be a point of focus, after being surprisingly left out of the XI for the first game.Since there are only seven competitive fixtures left—four T20Is and three ODIs—ahead of the Champions Trophy, the team management does not have plenty of time to hand Shami a sustained run in the build-up to the global event. But if the thinktank decides to stick with the idea of having just one frontline pacer and three specialist spinners—Varun Chakravarthy, Axar Patel and Ravi Bishnoi—Shami may have to warm the bench again.Shami, wearing a protective gear on his knees, appeared fine on the eve of the encounter, operating along with pace colleague Arshdeep Singh.Spin is likely to have a say on a fresh black-soil Chepauk pitch. Considering the England batters’ issues against quality spin, India’s slow-bowling department will eye another feast in favourable conditions.“Back in Chennai in blues, I see it as a very important day for me. Playing for my country and in front of my parents and the home crowd will be very special. We will have certain plans, but I will also look to be instinctive depending on the situation. My role is to be aggressive and brave… keep bowling to the stumps,” said Varun on Friday.With Suryakumar recently reaffirming that Sanju Samson is the first-choice wicketkeeper, opener Abhishek Sharma has a lot riding on his performances.Abhishek will have a direct competitor once Yashasvi Jaiswal is back in the T20 scheme of things and must continue to deliver the goods to strengthen his case. The 24-year-old has recently let his willow do the talking with impactful knocks, including the free-flowing 79 on Wednesday.England must find a method to succeed while retaining their aggressive style of play. Making moves to square the series, England have roped in fast bowler Brydon Carse for Gus Atkinson, the pacer who was taken to the cleaners last game.",India beat England by eight wickets in the first T20I in Kolkata.

CHENNAI: Stars returning to play domestic tournaments has been the hot topic of discussion in Indian cricket of late, especially with coach Gautam Gambhir and the BCCI making it clear that domestic outings are a must for those who want to play for India.Varun Chakravarthy , a key component of India’s T20I set-up, on Friday echoed Gambhir’s views, emphasising that consistently featuring for his state side Tamil Nadu in white-ball competitions has contributed to his growth as a spinner. “Definitely, it gives me the rhythm (before joining the India team). The level in domestic cricket is extremely high. I would say that it is almost on par with the IPL and the international matches that we play,” said Varun on the eve of the second India-England T20I here.Varun finished as the second-highest wicket-taker in the recent Vijay Hazare Trophy (50 overs) with 18 scalps in six matches and also shone in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy (T20). “I would suggest to everyone to go and play the Mushtaq Ali Trophy as it is very challenging. We play on small grounds and I find it very tough playing the SMAT.“It (domestic cricket) has definitely helped me get better, be more instinctive and on my toes. It has also helped me to think correctly at the right time,” Varun said.‘Should be ready for all challenges’: Varun stressed that the bowlers must try to stay one step ahead of the batters, even though T20 has become a batter-dominated format with favourable surfaces and small-sized boundaries.“In T20s, almost everywhere, the grounds are very small. Bowlers have the challenge of bowling from smaller ends. We plan for that as well. If we say that the batters are looking to have an aggressive approach, that is how T20 is. I cannot complain or be shocked by their (England’s) approach. I am expecting it and I have certain plans for that. Let us see if they work.”The 33-year-old also said that he has been putting in the hard yards to turn into a multi-utility cricketer across levels. “I have been working on my batting for the last six to seven months. I started my preparation at Kolkata Knight Riders, with the help of Abhishek Nayar (current India assistant coach). That kind of helped me. There is still a lot of work to do.”",Varun Chakravarthy says playing for Tamil Nadu in domestic tournaments has helped his development as a spinner. The 33-year-old says he has been putting in the hard yards to turn into a multi-utility cricketer across levels.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117541645,imgsize-31552,width-400,resizemode-4/117541645.jpg"

'It's all instinctive' - Varun Chakravarthy on his plans for 2nd T20I against England

NEW DELHI: A rare incident on Friday during the Ranji Trophy Elite Group A match between Mumbai and Jammu & Kashmir at the Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC) ground in Mumbai raised more eyebrows on the umpiring standards in domestic cricket.In an unusual sequence of events on Day 2, Mumbai captain Ajinkya Rahane was recalled to the crease nearly five minutes after being dismissed and entering the dressing room, following a third umpire review that confirmed a no-ball by the bowler - Umar Nazir .The drama unfolded in the 25th over of Mumbai’s second innings. J&K pacer Umar Nazir bowled a short delivery that cramped Rahane, forcing a mistimed pull shot that gloved through to the wicketkeeper. Rahane was promptly given out and walked back to the dressing room, with Shardul Thakur stepping out to replace him.However, the situation took a turn when the on-field umpires received confirmation from the third umpire that Nazir had overstepped. In a rare intervention, the umpires sent Thakur back and asked Rahane to return to the crease.Rahane, visibly confused, later learned from the umpires that they had signaled him to wait for a no-ball check, but the Mumbai captain hadn’t heard the communication amidst the commotion.As per the rules, the recall is valid up to the moment the ball comes into play for the next delivery.But Rahane was dismissed just an over later. The same bowler, Nazir, bowled a full delivery outside off, and Rahane’s uppish drive was spectacularly caught by J&K captain Paras Dogra at mid-off, leaving no room for a second recall.For the defending champions Mumbai, Shardul Thakur spearheaded their resurgence with an unbeaten century. Thakur’s second first-class hundred, alongside a robust 173-run partnership with Tanush Kotian for the eighth wicket, took Mumbai to 274/7 at stumps. Thakur remained unbeaten on 113 (119 balls, 17 fours), with Kotian contributing 58 off 119 balls.Mumbai now hold a lead of 188 runs, having recovered from a precarious position at 101/7 in their second innings.",Mumbai captain Ajinkya Rahane was recalled to the crease nearly five minutes after being dismissed and entering the dressing room.

Despite criticism, she insists her work is educational. “I can’t think of one situation where an 18-year-old has had sex where they’ve had to bring a passport, sign consent forms, and do a breathalyser,” she said on ITV’s This Morning.She also addressed criticism for sleeping with married men, arguing, “If wives aren’t going to pleasure husbands, let them go elsewhere. It’s just an act; the husbands mean nothing to me.”Bonnie transitioned to sex work after moving to Australia in 2022 with her now ex-husband, Oliver Davidson. Formerly a recruitment professional, she launched her career as a cam girl and later joined OnlyFans.She claims her family now supports her career, with her mother even assisting her business by booking appointments and handing out condoms for marketing. “It’s changed their life completely for the better,” she said.Bonnie defended her actions, stating, “These 18-year-olds can go to the army, they can drive, they can drink… If they want to use their own bodies to come and sleep with me, that is their decision.”","Bonnie Blue, 25, claims to have had sex with 1,057 men in 12 hours. The event took place in London, allegedly surpassing the previous record of 919 men in 24 hours set by adult actress Lisa Sparks in 2004. Bonnie has previously defended her claims of sleeping with ""barely legal"" 18-year-olds.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117236635,imgsize-951405,width-400,resizemode-4/117236635.jpg"

SA20: Captain Aiden Markram reflects on Sunrisers Eastern Cape's bonus-point victories

Sunrisers Eastern Cape electrified St George's Park with a fourth consecutive victory, defeating the Joburg Super Kings by 14 runs to move into second place on the SA20 table. The defending champions now sit at 19 points, one behind the Paarl Royals , who have played one game fewer.The Sunrisers' resurgence was spearheaded by captain Aiden Markram , who anchored the innings with a crucial 43 off 29 balls, and Tristan Stubbs , who rediscovered form with an unbeaten 35 off 22. Reflecting on his performance, Stubbs acknowledged the challenges he's faced this season.""It hasn't been great. I haven't been getting the runs I wanted, but the team's winning, so it's a lot better,"" Stubbs said. ""Hopefully, we've got some good momentum now and can carry on with that. Momentum is basically what we've got to ride. We've got a game on Sunday, so we'll prepare as best we can for that.""Stubbs credited the Sunrisers' success to their ability to adapt to the tricky St George's Park wicket and the relentless support of the home crowd. ""That wicket's not easy,"" he explained. ""The rate got to just under 12s or around 10-and-a-half, and walking in to bat on that surface is really hard. The bowlers stuck to the game plan, hit the wicket, and it did enough to get us those wickets. Once we got one, it was tough for new batters to come in.""The crowd was incredible — I reckon the stats are wrong because that was the loudest I've ever played in front of here,"" Stubbs added. ""This is the best place to play cricket as a home team, whether it's for the Proteas or the Sunrisers. When you're winning and they're singing 'Bye Bye Joburg,' it's so cool.""Stubbs also highlighted the team's sluggish start to the season and how they have turned things around. ""We just needed a win,"" he said. ""A few of us came straight from the Test series and arrived the day before. It took us a while to gel together as a team, but now everyone's enjoying being together, and it's showing on the field.""On the other side, Joburg Super Kings head coach Stephen Fleming admitted that injuries have disrupted their campaign but praised his players for stepping up in challenging circumstances. ""Managing injuries, particularly in the fast-bowling department, has been a challenge,"" Fleming said. ""We've had to make more changes game to game than expected, trying to find rhythm and opportunities for players.""Fleming acknowledged the Sunrisers' strength at home but lamented his team's missed opportunities. ""They've adapted well to conditions here and are a balanced side. We had moments where we were ahead in the game, but we let it slip. Small things — no balls, fielding lapses, and not executing plans under pressure — cost us. We need to tidy those up and stay resilient,"" he explained.Despite the setback, Fleming found positives in his team's effort. ""We competed well, and some players showed promise under pressure. But tens, twenties, thirties don't win games. We're getting into good positions with the bat but losing wickets, which is unacceptable,"" he said.With the Sunrisers now riding high, the Super Kings will aim to regroup as they return to home conditions. For Stubbs and his team, the focus remains on maintaining momentum and delivering under the bright lights of SA20.","Sunrisers Eastern Cape move into second place on the SA20 table.

MELBOURNE: Aryna Sabalenka is a towering personality with a ginormous game. The Belarusian’s USP is her ability to play high-voltage tennis at all times. Sabalenka goes mostly with instinct, but her game isn’t without tactics.The forehand cross-court, used to draw opponents wide, has given an edge to her returns, and has been perfected over the past year. Not enough is said about the 26-year-old’s flawless footwork, getting her into position to play her shots.Her play is so big, Madison Keys of the US will look to top that in Saturday’s women’s final, where Sabalenka will be going for a three-peat. The defending champion and world No. 1 thought it was just ‘crazy’ that she had put herself in a position to win three successive Australian titles and fix her name alongside the sport’s legends.Swiss Martina Hingis is the last woman to achieve that feat, from 1997 to 1999. It’s no surprise that Sabalenka, the Minsk-born Miami resident, called Melbourne Park ‘home’.“I feel good here, I feel the support, this year even more. I feel like I’m coming to my home slam,” said. “I know everything, I know every area, I know where to warm up so it’s not that crowded. I go (out) there and I feel people screaming my name. I have goosebumps every time they scream, ‘Let’s go, Aryna!’.”Keys, seeded 19, playing her first final here, applauded Sabalenka’s mentality.“She plays such fearless tennis,” she said.",Aryna Sabalenka is the defending champion and world No. 1.

Travis Kelce Breaks Down Chiefs’ Advantage Ahead of AFC Championship Battle Against the Bills



Flipping the Playoff Switch, Fixing the CFP, Why We Love Snow Games & Hobby Horsing Around | Ep 121

A Familiar Rivalry and a Dogfight Ahead



As the Kansas City Chiefs gear up for a high-stakes AFC Championship showdown against the Buffalo Bills , tight end Travis Kelce offered a candid glimpse into the team's mindset during this week’s episode of New Heights, the podcast he co-hosts with his brother Jason Kelce. With a trip to the Super Bowl hanging in the balance, Kelce highlighted key areas where the Chiefs might hold an edge but remained cautious about underestimating their opponent.When asked by Jason about his keys to the game, Travis Kelce refrained from diving too deeply into strategic details but pointed out two critical factors in the Chiefs’ favor: their depth of offensive playmakers and the relative health of their defense.""Well we do know this,"" Kelce said. ""We got a few extra weapons on offense. I think we're a little bit healthier on the defensive side.""The Chiefs’ offensive arsenal is undeniably stacked compared to their Super Bowl run last season. New additions, including five-time Pro Bowler DeAndre Hopkins, free-agent signee Marquise Brown, and rookie sensation Xavier Worthy, have bolstered Kansas City’s receiving corps. Their firepower will complement quarterback Patrick Mahomes , who remains one of the league’s most prolific playmakers.However, Buffalo is no slouch on offense. MVP finalist Josh Allen led a dynamic passing attack in the Bills’ divisional-round victory over the Baltimore Ravens, connecting with seven different receivers. Running back James Cook, who has accumulated 187 rushing yards in two postseason games, adds another layer of threat to their offensive game plan.Kelce’s remarks on defensive health could prove particularly prescient. Kansas City, benefiting from a first-round bye, has returned to near-full strength on defense. The lone starter on the injury report, cornerback Jaylen Watson, was listed as a full participant in practice.Conversely, the Bills are facing significant challenges in their secondary. Starting safety Taylor Rapp has been ruled out due to back and hip injuries, forcing rookie Cole Bishop into the lineup. Additionally, cornerback Christian Benford remains in concussion protocol and missed Friday's practice, although head coach Sean McDermott expects his return. Meanwhile, standout linebacker Matt Milano and nickel corner Taron Johnson are both nursing injuries despite practicing fully.Despite these potential advantages, Kelce emphasized that nothing will come easy against a formidable Bills team.“It doesn’t mean that we’ll have the upper hand just because of that,” Kelce cautioned. “Two great coached teams. Two superstars at quarterback. And playmakers all over the board. It’s gonna be a dogfight.”With both teams boasting star power and familiarity from frequent matchups in recent years, Sunday night’s game at GEHA Field promises to deliver an electrifying contest. For Kelce and his teammates, the goal is simple: leave it all on the field.Also Read: ""They got a D line that can make an impact"": Tom Brady, Three-Time NFL MVP, Makes Bold Prediction for the Commanders vs. Eagles NFC Championship Game “I’m just going out there and playing my f------ tail off for these guys next to me,” Kelce added, setting the tone for what is shaping up to be an epic AFC Championship battle.The Chiefs and Bills will clash at 6:30 p.m. on Sunday night, with a Super Bowl berth on the line.","The Kansas City Chiefs face the Buffalo Bills in the AFC Championship on Sunday.

Road to the final for Aryna Sabalenka

Road to the final for Madison Keys

Milestones to be achieved

Sabalenka is aiming for a historic three-peat at the Australian Open, a feat last accomplished by Hingis from 1997 to 1999. A victory would also give her a fourth Grand Slam title.

If successful, Sabalenka would become the first woman to win three consecutive hard-court Grand Slam titles this century, following Hingis, who won the 1997 Australian Open, the 1997 US Open, and the 1998 Australian Open. Only three women in the Open Era have achieved three consecutive hard-court majors, and Sabalenka could join Graf, Seles, and Hingis in this exclusive club.

On the other hand, Keys is vying to become the first first-time Grand Slam singles champion since Coco Gauff at the 2023 US Open. This would be her second title of the season and her tenth overall.

Having already defeated No. 2 Swiatek, Keys aims to become the first player to beat both the World No. 1 and No. 2 in a Grand Slam since Svetlana Kuznetsova at the 2009 Roland Garros and the first at the Australian Open since Serena Williams in 2005.

NEW DELHI: After a rest day on Thursday, the Tata Steel Chess Tournament 2025 resumed full throttle on Friday. A dramatic Round 6 unfolded, with Indian chess prodigies making their presence felt in both Masters and Challengers sections amid the chilly weather of Wijk aan Zee .Struggling with three early losses in the tournament, Arjun Erigaisi opted for stability against the top-seeded American, Fabiano Caruana . Playing with the white pieces, Erigaisi opened with the King’s Pawn and steered the game into a Berlin Defense. The Indian grandmaster castled early.By the 22nd move, both queens were off the board, setting the stage for a balanced middlegame. Soon after, the players agreed to a draw through threefold repetition with 30 moves.It was Erigaisi’s third draw of the tournament. Caruana, also grappling with form issues, welcomed the result. For Erigaisi, the draw against a higher-rated opponent is a noteworthy outcome, but whether he can stage a comeback from here remains to be seen.Praggnanandhaa Rameshbabu began his game against the defending champion of the tournament GM Wei Yi of China with a King’s Pawn Opening, met by the Morphy Defense.Wei’s precise counterplay limited Pragg’s opportunities to launch a sustained attack.

IND vs ENG: Coach and captain gave complete freedom, says Abhishek Sharma

NEW DELHI: England captain Heather Knight couldn’t hide her frustration as she threw her bat down when the umpires halted play during the team’s second T20I against Australia on Thursday. Knight, who was anchoring England’s chase of 186 runs in 20 overs, was forced to leave the field due to rain, just as she seemed poised to take the match to the wire.Clearly irritated by the decision, Knight’s reaction reflected her determination to see the chase through. At the time play was stopped, England were 168/4 in 19.1 overs, trailing the par score by just six runs under the DLS method .Knight had been leading from the front in the closing stages, batting on a blistering 39* off 18 balls. She had just struck a boundary off the first ball of the final over when the umpires intervened, leaving England tantalizingly short of what could have been a thrilling finish.Australia went on to win the rain-affected match by six runs in Canberra.Also See: Champions Trophy 2025 Following the match, when the umpires declared Australia the winners via the DLS method, Knight was seen shaking hands with Australian captain Tahlia McGrath but refrained from shaking hands with one of the umpires.Knight then proceeded to the dugout, where she greeted her teammates and the Australian players.""Great game of cricket. Managed to get that partnership going in the end but unfortunate for it to end that way. It was always going to be tought to chase down 180, but we fought well and will take that confidence forward. A few positives today, really proud of the way the girls fought,"" Knight said after the match.","England captain Heather Knight frustrated after play stopped due to rain.

NEW DELHI: Novak Djokovic 's quest for a record-breaking 25th Grand Slam title ended prematurely as he retired injured during his Australian Open semi-final against Alexander Zverev on Friday.The 37-year-old Serbian star, who had his upper left leg heavily taped following an injury in the quarter-finals, called it quits after losing a grueling first set 7-6 (7/5).Djokovic's exit from the court was met with a mix of boos and applause from the crowd, as Zverev advanced to his first Melbourne final.This marks the fifth consecutive Grand Slam where Djokovic has failed to secure the title he needs to surpass Margaret Court's record of 24 Grand Slam victories.His last Grand Slam triumph came at the 2023 US Open, raising doubts about his ability to overtake Court's record.The defeat also denied Djokovic his 100th career title, a feat only achieved by Roger Federer (102) in the history of tennis.Zverev will now face either world number one Jannik Sinner or American 21st seed Ben Shelton in Sunday's final.Despite being a two-time Grand Slam runner-up at the 2020 US Open and last year's French Open, this will be Zverev's first appearance in the Australian Open final .Last year, Zverev suffered a heartbreaking defeat to Daniil Medvedev in the semi-finals after holding a 2-0 lead. However, he entered this season with renewed energy, finishing 2024 as world number two and winning more matches than anyone except Sinner, having recovered from a severe ankle injury.Djokovic's fitness was under scrutiny heading into the semi-final, as he required medical attention during his four-set quarter-final victory over Carlos Alcaraz. The Serbian expressed concerns about his physical condition before the match.Despite his renowned ability to recover, Djokovic's movement appeared unhindered initially, as evidenced by a 27-shot rally in his opening service game and his ability to save four break points. Zverev also had his share of missed opportunities, failing to convert break points at crucial moments.The match remained on serve until the tiebreak, after which Djokovic ultimately retired due to his injury.",Novak Djokovic retires injured in Australian Open semi-final against Alexander Zverev.

NEW DELHI: Former Australian captain Ricky Ponting has advised the Australian selectors to include young opener Sam Konstas in the playing XI for the upcoming Test series against Sri Lanka in Galle.With Australia having already secured a spot in the ICC World Test Championship final against South Africa, they can approach the Sri Lanka series with a relaxed mindset.Ponting believes that Konstas, who impressed during his debut against India in the Boxing Day Test, should be given an opportunity to gain valuable experience in the challenging Sri Lankan conditions.""I think they will pick Konstas and I think they should pick Konstas. He is the one they have identified, he has hit the ground running here in his first innings as well. He provided a lot of entertainment and a lot of buzz around that whole series (against India),"" Ponting told Sydney Morning Herald .""I think they need to play him, to be honest. It is a hard place to play and a hard place to win. It will be a hard place to bat for all of our guys, but especially some of the younger guys who have not experienced those conditions much in the past. But I think they should pick him, it will be a great learning experience for him.""The 19-year-old showcased positive intent and the ability to unsettle the Indian bowlers, scoring 113 runs in four innings.While Australia is considering shuffling their batting order to accommodate the spin-friendly conditions in Sri Lanka, with Travis Head potentially opening alongside Usman Khawaja , Ponting emphasised the importance of investing in Konstas' Test career.""I would be picking him if I was a selector,"" he added. ""I think the order will stay the same. I think it will be the same with the option they have is maybe playing another spinner. They will have Beau Webster there who will give the seam-up overs, one of the quicks is going to miss out, so Cooper Connolly might find himself in a 7 or 8 batting spot and bowling a few overs as well.""","Former Australian captain Ricky Ponting has advised the Australian selectors to include young opener Sam Konstas in the playing XI for the upcoming Test series against Sri Lanka.

MUMBAI: The moment he completed his scintillating, gritty 105-ball century, sweeping Abid Mushtaq for a single, an ecstatic Shardul Thakur seemed to have forgotten that he had been affected by severe cramps which required treatment multiple times on the field.Sprinting towards the Mumbai dressing room/clubhouse, he spread his arms, blew kisses and raised his finger towards the audience, which was wholeheartedly applauding Thakur’s second first-class hundred, which was even acknowledged by Jammu & Kashmir’s 40-year-old captain Paras Dogra as “one of the best he had seen” in domestic cricket .The past 12 months haven’t been an easy ride for Thakur. With the Indian team management looking beyondt he 33-year-old in red-ball cricket, preferring the talented Nitish Kumar Reddy instead, there are questions over his future in international cricket .A slow comeback to the game after an ankle injury which required a surgery and no takers for the Mumbaikar at the IPL auction in Nov last year-it all seemed to suggest that the ‘Palghar Express’ was now chugging to the backpages of Indian cricket.However, like in the case of Mumbai in domestic cricket, you must write off Thakur at your own peril.At the Sharad Pawar Academy at BKC, rescuing Mumbai twice in two days from precarious situations with sizzling performances with the bat against the rampaging Jammu & Kashmir bowlers, Thakur has shown why the acronyms ‘Lord Thakur’ and the ‘Crisis Man of Mumbai ’ suit him so well.Serving a stern reminder to the national selectors about his never-say-die “khadoos” attitude and fighting skills, in a gallant show which saw him battle cramps after he crossed fifty and a hit on the chest from an Umar Nazir bouncer after he reached his hundred, Thakur stroked a glorious century (113 not out, 119b, 17x4), which will be remembered for a long time the way it magically brought Mumbai back into the match from a near-impossible situation.Trailing by 86 runs on Day 2, Mumbai seemed done and dusted and headed for their second consecutive defeat to J&K in almost a decade when they slipped to 86 for five in their second innings, which basically read ‘0 for five.’A 54-run opening stand between India’s Test & ODI captain Rohit Sharma (28, 35b, 2x4, 3x6) and Yashasvi Jaiswal (26, 51b, 4x4) had promised much, but then a stunning collapse saw the defending champions lose six wickets for 47 runs as Hardik Tamore (1), Shivam Dube (0, bagged a king pair), Shreyas Iyer (17, should’ve been adjudged caught behind of Umar Nazir when was on 8 but umpire S Ravi missed a loud edge, protested when he was eventually given out in the same fashion), skipper Ajinkya Rahane (16, was caught brilliantly at mid-off by J&K captain Paras Dogra) and Shams Mulani (4) all fell in a heap.At 101 for seven, Mumbai looked to be heading for an embarrassing defeat inside two days with the visitors’ pacers Auqib Nabi (3-69), Umar Nazir (2-76) and Yudhvir Singh (2-63) again firing on all cylinders.However, in walked Tanush Kotian. Fresh off his maiden India call-up for the final two Tests of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Australia, the off-spinning allrounder served as Thakur’s perfect ‘alliance partner, stroking an unbeaten 58 (119b, 6x4). The duo’s epic, unfinished 173-run partnership in 234 balls for the eighth wicket turned the match on its head, and left the J&K bowlers completely deflated.Incidentally, it was at same venue almost an year back, in the Ranji Trophy semifinal against Tamil Nadu that Thakur (109) and Kotian (89 not out) had pulled off a similarly magnificent rescue act, taking Mumbai from 106 for seven to 378, which paved the way for an innings & 70-run win on that occasion.This too, was a fightback for the ages, and it has now given Mumbai a 188-run lead in the match, with three wickets left in the bag. While it’s not clear if Thakur will be fit enough to bowl in the second innings, Mumbai will bank on seamer Mohit Avasthi, who took five for 52 in the first innings to wrap up J&K for 206, and their spinners Mulani and Kotian to do the job.After he stroked a gritty fifty in challenging conditions on Day One, Thakur wasn’t willing to talk up about his performance.“What can I talk about my quality? Others should talk about it. They should see that if someone has quality, he should be given more chances. I like batting in difficult situations. In easy situations, everyone does well. But how you put up the show in adverse situations matters. I see tough situations as a challenge and always think about how to overcome that challenge...” he had said.Dogra summed up J&K’s plight best: “Hathi nikal gaya, bas poonch reh gayi (the elephant almost went through, but the tail was left).”",Shardul Thakur scores 113 not out in Mumbai's Ranji Trophy win over Jammu & Kashmir. Mumbai had been bowled out for 106 in their second innings on Day 2. Tanush Kotian scored 58 not out to help Mumbai to an innings & 70-run win.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117530217,imgsize-26366,width-400,resizemode-4/117530217.jpg"

'It's all instinctive' - Varun Chakravarthy on his plans for 2nd T20I against England

England suffered a one-sided defeat in the first T20I against India in Kolkata on Friday, and the visiting team's vice-captain believes the smog at the Eden Gardens created additional difficulties in reading spinner Varun Chakravarthy , who took three wickets. However, Brook hopes better conditions in Chennai during the second T20I at the MA Chidambaram Stadium on Saturday will take care of that issue.""Chakaravarthy is an exceptionally good bowler. But with the smog the other night (in Kolkata), it was a lot harder to pick (him). Hopefully, the air is a bit clearer here (Chennai) and we can see the ball a bit easier,"" Brook told 'Daily Telegraph'.""Facing spin in T20 cricket is probably the hardest thing in the game, especially because I always get out trying to absolutely smack it,"" he said.Brook made 17 in the first match of the series, before being cleaned up by Chakravarthy.But a couple of seasons ago in the IPL, Brook took the attack to Chakravarthy while he was bowling for Kolkata Knight Riders in their match against Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH), which saw the England batter hitting a century.He would, thus, hope to put the disappointment of the first T20I behind against a familiar opponent and potentially replicate his earlier success.""I was going to watch it (innings for SRH) on the way in (to Friday's practice session), but my phone wouldn't work, so I'll have a look a little bit later,"" he added.Chakravarthy took crucial wickets of Jos Buttler (68), Brook and Liam Livingstone (0) in India's convincing seven-wicket win.""Maybe I've got to rein in a little bit, but we'll see. I think I do have a method (to tackle spinners). It's just trying to do it consistently and more often. I come in the middle order, so the first few balls I face are usually of spin,"" Brook said.","Harry Brook believes the smog in Kolkata made it difficult to read Varun Chakravarthy. The England vice-captain hopes better conditions in Chennai will take care of that issue. Chakravarty took crucial wickets of Jos Buttler (68), Brook and Liam Livingstone.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117529684,imgsize-22422,width-400,resizemode-4/117529684.jpg"

'It's all instinctive' - Varun Chakravarthy on his plans for 2nd T20I against England

IND vs ENG: Coach and captain gave complete freedom, says Abhishek Sharma

NEW DELHI: India spinner Varun Chakravarthy highlights the leadership qualities of head coach Gautam Gambhir and T20I skipper Suryakumar Yadav , emphasising their ability to shield the players from external pressures and distractions.""GG (Gambhir) and Surya (Kumar Yadav) made sure that there was no external stress on the players. They keep the external noise away,"" Chakravarthy said during the pre-match press conference ahead of the second T20I in Chennai.Playing at Chepauk, his home venue, Chakravarthy is set to feature in his first international match there, and he expressed his delight at the opportunity.""Back to Chennai and the base is very important for me. I see it as a very important day for me. Playing for my country in front of my parents and the home crowd. It is very special for me,"" he said.Chakravarthy compared the standards of the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy to the IPL, emphasizing that cricketers should participate more in the domestic tournament to enhance their tactical understanding of the T20 format.He was instrumental in India's seven-wicket victory over England in the first T20I in Kolkata on Wednesday, claiming three crucial wickets.Meanwhile, several prominent players, including India captain Rohit Sharma and dynamic wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant, represented their respective domestic sides in the penultimate round of the Ranji Trophy.""The level of domestic cricket is extremely high. I would say almost on par with IPL and the other international matches we play. So, I would suggest everyone to play the Syed Mushtaq Ali because we play on small grounds. It is very challenging,"" Chakravarthy said.""I find it very tough playing SMAT. It has definitely helped me to get better, be more instinctive, be on my toes and think correctly at the right moment,"" he added.The 33-year-old backed his words with action, finishing as the second-highest wicket-taker in this season's Vijay Hazare Trophy with 18 wickets, while also claiming nine wickets in seven matches during the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy (SMAT).He also highlighted the importance of his meticulous preparation before matches to outsmart batters in the T20 format.""The first thing begins with preparation, looking at the batsmen's video and what are their early shots and what shots they are looking to play, and have they added a new shot in their book.""Definitely, I do that research. Based on the pitch, certain shots work and certain shots don't work. Based on that, I have a certain calculation in my mind and work around that,"" he explained.Chakravarthy's approach has paid off handsomely, as he has picked up 20 wickets in nine T20Is since making his comeback for India during the series against Bangladesh in October 2024.Though he had to wait three years to return to the national team, the setback did not deter him, showcasing his resilience and determination.""When I got dropped (in 2021), that gave me a lot of time to work on my mindset and my technique, re-change, and tweak many things about my bowling.""Now, he is determined to make the most of every opportunity to solidify his position as a key spinner in India's T20 setup.""My role is to just be aggressive and be brave and keep bowling at the stumps. That has been my role. There is no added responsibility.","Varun Chakravarthy highlights leadership qualities of head coach Gautam Gambhir and T20I skipper Suryakumar Yadav.
