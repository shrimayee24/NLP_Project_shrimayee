WATCH:

NEW DELHI: The ongoing three-match ODI series between India and Sri Lanka has faced controversy following a Decision Review System (DRS) incident during the second ODI on Sunday. Sri Lanka secured a 32-run victory, taking a 1-0 lead after the first match ended in a tie. The issue arose from a contentious DRS call involving Virat Kohli .Sri Lankan spinner Jeffrey Vandersay 's impressive performance, taking 6 for 33, was pivotal in bowling India out for 208 in 42.2 overs as they chased a target of 241.Despite Vandersay's efforts, attention shifted to a DRS decision that left the Sri Lankan team frustrated.In the 15th over of India's chase, Akila Dananjaya bowled an off-break that sharply spun in, beating Kohli's inside edge. Initially ruled lbw by the on-field umpire, Kohli opted for a review. The UltraEdge technology indicated a spike near the bat, leading TV umpire Joel Wilson to overturn the decision. Kohli's relief was evident as he smiled following the reversed call.The decision did not sit well with the Sri Lankan players. Kusal Mendis expressed his frustration by throwing his helmet to the ground, and Asalanka conveyed his displeasure to the on-field umpire, Raveendra Wimalasiri. Sri Lankan coach Sanath Jayasuriya also came down from the dressing room to discuss the decision with the reserve umpire.Despite the reprieve, Kohli's innings was short-lived. Four overs later, Vandersay bowled Kohli with a flipper that trapped him in front of the middle stump. Although Kohli considered another review, his partner Axar Patel dissuaded him, resulting in Kohli's departure.As Kohli approached the Sri Lankan unit for the customary post-match handshake, Jayasuriya stopped him for an intense but brief chat. The exchange ended amicably, with both men patting each other on the shoulder.India now face a do-or-die situation in the third ODI in Colombo on Wednesday, needing a win to level the series.",Sri Lanka beat India by 32 runs in second ODI in New Delhi.

"Neeraj Chopra: Under Neeraj’s shadow, Jena looks to peak after below-par season",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/under-neerajs-shadow-jena-looks-to-peak-after-below-par-season/articleshow/112297658.cms,"Javelin thrower Kishore Kumar Jena had almost given up the sport last year. But on Tuesday he will make his maiden appearance at the Olympics in Paris alongside defending champion Neeraj Chopra in the qualifications.However, he will have to do incredibly well to make it to the final round which will be held on Thursday. A total of 32 athletes divided into two groups of 16 will be taking part in the qualification and only 12 will make it to the final.Besides Neeraj, he will be competing with world No. 1 Jakub Vadlejch, two-time world champion Anderson Peters, reigning European Games champion Julina Webber and Commonwealth Games champion Arshad Nadeem among others.Jena, however, hasn’t been at his best this year. Starting his season at Doha Diamond League meet on May 10, his best throw was just 76.31m. Five days later, at National Federation Senior Athletics Competition in Bhubaneshwar, he disappointed once more with a throw of 75.49m.Next he took part at Indian Championships in Panchkula in June. He made a slight improvement from the last event in the qualification round and made a throw of 77.69m. To his relief in the finals, for the first time this season he breached the 80m mark with a throw of 80.84m but at Paris Diamond League meet last month he failed to perform once more. His best was just 78.10m that helped him finish eighth among 10 athletes.Despite the recent struggles, hiscoach Samarjeet Singh Malhi believes he will not disappoint at the biggest stage.“It’s all part and parcel of sports. We, after all, have been working to peak at the Olympics so there’s nothing to worry. Also he already qualified for the Olympics earlier and hence he didn’t have to push himself to earn qualification,” said the coach, a former javelin thrower himself, during a conversation last month.“Moreover, taking part in his maiden Diamond League meet wasn’t easy at the beginning of the season. He also had an injury in his left ankle and he struggled because of that.”After competing in Paris Diamond League early last month, Jena trained in Spala, Poland, ahead of the Games, and Malhi is more than happy with how it went. “We worked mainly on his speed. Also training there has helped Jena get acclimatised to the weather and the conditions that will be there in Paris,” said the coach.Besides his final preparations in Poland, Jena also had a training stint in Australia earlier this year where he worked on his blocking technique and one hopes all this hard work will eventually pay off.“Playing for the country at the Olympics is enough motivation for him. He is fit, has worked hard and has everyone’s blessings. So I’m confident that he will perform well,” the coach added.While Jena now gets set for Paris, one can’t help but think of the conversation that Jena, who was considering quitting the sport at that point, had with his father last year following which he decided to take part in the Sri Lankan Championships and threw 84.38m during the event to grab the gold.It was just what he needed to continue his love affair with the sport and he might be able to carry it on in the city of love.",Javelin thrower Kishore Kumar Jena had almost given up the sport last year. But on Tuesday he will make his maiden appearance at the Olympics in Paris.

Yusuf Dikec , a Turkish pistol shooter , has recently become a social media sensation for his calm and seemingly casual demeanor while securing a silver medal at the 2024 Paris Olympics . Many have praised his ‘ main character energy ,’ while others jokingly speculated that he might be an undercover assassin returning to serve his nation. A viral social media post even claimed that Dikec was a 51-year-old mechanic from Istanbul who took up shooting after a divorce.In reality, Dikec is far from a newcomer to the sport. He is a seasoned athlete who has represented Türkiye in every Summer Olympics since 2008. Before his shooting career, Dikec served as a non-commissioned officer in the Turkish Gendarmerie, Türkiye’s paramilitary police force. His recent partnership with Sevval Ilayda Tarhan in the mixed team 10-meter air pistol event at the 2024 Paris Olympics led to Türkiye’s first-ever medal in Olympic shooting.The misinformation likely started with a social media post that included a photo of Dikec and a fictional story about him taking up shooting after a difficult personal life. However, a closer look at his background reveals that Dikec has a long and accomplished history in competitive shooting.Dikec holds a degree from the Gazi University School of Physical Training and Education in Ankara and a Master’s degree in coaching from Selcuk University in Türkiye. His Olympic journey began in 2008, and the Paris 2024 Olympics marked his fifth appearance on the world stage. He started shooting competitively in 2001, shortly after joining the Turkish Gendarmerie General Command. His consistent participation in the Olympics, along with his well-documented records and accomplishments, debunks the viral narrative that he is a recent entrant into the sport.","Yusuf Dikec has represented Türkiye in every Summer Olympics since 2008.

NEW DELHI: The Grambusch brothers, Mats and Tom, were writing Germany's comeback scripts for fun at the World Cup last year. It had a happy ending as well. The Germans lifted the trophy in a final that can only be described as 'madness refusing to end'. The penalty shootout went to sudden death and required 14 attempts to give the World Cup its winner and dethrone Belgium.The point of reference is obvious for those having their eyes on Paris. India are playing Germany in the semifinal of the Summer Olympics.A place in the final, confirmation of a medal -- the stakes are pretty high, even higher for India, who haven't played an Olympic hockey final for 44 years and have not won successive hockey medals at the Games for 52 years. And PR Sreejesh will hope that he finishes his career with a medal in the biggest game of his iconic career, an Olympic final.For each of the above to happen, India will have to beat Germany.A little part of the narrative for the Germans is also revenge. The wounds of that epic bronze-medal match at the Tokyo Olympics are fresh at three years old. The Germans sank into the turf after ending on the wrong side of 5-4 final score, while the Indians celebrated a long-awaited return to the Games' podium after 41 years.The storyline of Tuesday's semifinal has enough sub-plots to make any player nervous. But this Indian team has played like one that doesn't carry butterflies requiring Dr. Rajendra Kalra's psychological tricks to settle.Forty-nine years ago, Dr Kalra, a physician settled in Chandigarh, was named as the official doctor of the Indian team travelling to Kuala Lumpur for the 1975 World Cup.Before the final against Pakistan, a couple of players complained to him about a stomach ailment. Reading the players' minds and it coinciding with the enormity of the occasion, Dr Kalra played a psychologist instead of a physician.He asked the organisers for some jaggery and black sesame seeds. Once it was delivered to him, he melted the jaggery, added the sesame seeds to it and rolled the mixture into tiny balls resembling medicine pills.Dr Kalra asked the jittery players to take that before stepping onto the field.It worked. India won the World Cup. But not because of Dr Kalra's pseudo pills, but because of 11 confident players on the field.Back to Paris, this Indian team has come of age.If the win over Australia in the Olympics after 52 years was like claiming lost territory, coach Craig Fulton's men turned its defence into fortresss in the quarterfinal. Playing with 10 men for over 40 minutes after Amit Rohidas was shown the red card, India put adversity to shame by not just holding Great Britain to 1-1 in 60 minutes, but also by stamping its authority in the shootout. India scored all four, Sreejesh saved two. A 4-2 (1-1) win took India to a second consecutive Olympic semifinal.But that Rohidas red card, for flaying his stick in anger across the face of England striker Will Calnan, came back to haunt the Tokyo bronze medallists.The defender, most importantly India's first rusher on penalty-corner defence, was handed a one-match suspension and will sit out of the semifinal on Tuesday.If there is one thing that can make India nervous before running into the Germans, it's Rohidas's unavailability, which hampers rolling substitutions, short-corner defence and a reduced drag-flick backup for skipper Harmanpreet Singh.Where it can also hurt India is in manufacturing counter-attacks after a successful defence of a penalty corner, because one of the midfielders might have to be pulled back to complete the set of five in India's post with Rohidas out on the suspension chair.Perhaps one way to look beyond that disadvantage is that it remains 11 vs 11 on the battlefield. The dugout can take care of the 15 vs 16.The massive occasion reminds of the comment once made by former India coach Michael Nobbs.""You need to put coffins on the sidelines and give it your all when playing for your country,"" the Australian once said.You can't doubt this Indian team about giving it their all. If they can do it for 120 more minutes across two days in the French capital, the 'Holy Grail' will be back to where it belonged for eight Olympics in a row.All roads for the Indians on Tuesday in Paris will lead to the Yves-du-Manoir Stadium, while millions back home cross their fingers.",India play Germany in the semifinal of the Summer Olympics.

Wrestler Nisha Dahiya too was left in tears after an injury dashed her hopes in the women's freestyle category.Sen, aiming to be India's first male shuttler to win an Olympic medal, faced a tough matchup against Malaysia's world no.7 Lee Zii Jia in the bronze playoff.Despite a strong start, Sen was unable to maintain his lead and lost the match 21-13, 16-21, 11-21 in a 71-minute contest.""I had my chances in the second set and could have definitely done better.

Leading 8-1 with just over 90 seconds left, Dahiya sustained a serious injury to her right hand. The injury left her in agonizing pain, and she was unable to continue effectively.Following a medical break, Nisha's right hand lost strength, and Pak Sol Gum capitalized on the opportunity, scoring nine straight points.

ONE-MATCH SUSPENSION FOR ROHIDAS

HOW ROHIDAS'S ABSENCE AFFECTS INDIA

The Indian men's hockey team has received a jolt ahead of their Paris Olympics semifinal against Germany and are already at a disadvantage in their quest for a place in the final after 44 years.The Tokyo Olympics bronze medallists will have only 15 players available to play the last-four clash instead of a full squad of 16 after defender Amit Rohidas was suspended for one match following his red card in the quarterfinal against Great Britain.The 31-year-old Rohidas was spotted swinging his stick across the face of British forward Will Calnan in the second quarter of the match on Sunday. The on-field umpire did not rule the offence as serious to get a red card, but Rohidas was shown red and given the marching orders after a video referral.Subsequently, India played the British team with 10 players for more than 40 minutes. However, the Harmanpreet Singh-led side defended heroically, thanks largely to PR Sreejesh's presence in the goalpost, to hold onto the 1-1 scoreline and take the game to a shootout.Goalkeeper Sreejesh once again turned out to be the star, saving two attempts by the GB team in the one-on-one shootout to help India earn a dramatic 4-2 win and a second successive entry into the semis at the Olympics.After the match, India officially raised a concern ""about the quality of umpiring and decision-making"" and citied ""several inconsistencies in officiating"" that ""potentially influenced the game's outcome"".Among the issues raised by India were ""inconsistent video umpire reviews, particularly regarding the red-card decision"" and the fact that the British goalkeeper was being coached from behind the goalpost during the shootout.""Hockey India calls for a thorough review of these matters to uphold the integrity of the sport and ensure fair play in future matches,"" the complaint read.However, later in the evening, the tournament's organising committee handed Rohidas a one-match ban for breaching the FIH Code of Conduct, which means India will have one player less in their usual squad of 16 men for the semifinal against Germany.“Amit Rohidas was suspended for one match for a breach of the FIH Code of Conduct which occurred during the India vs Great Britain match on August 4,” read the official statement by the FIH.“The suspension affects match No. 35 (India’s semi-final match against Germany), where Amit Rohidas will not participate and India will play with a squad of 15 players only.”Rohidas's absence will seriously hamper the Indian defence, their options of drag-flickers on penalty corners and rolling substitutions.

Shreyas Iyer (7) and KL Rahul (0) were sent at numbers six and seven, respectively.""My belief is that in any sport, position only matters if you're playing in different areas of a game. We lost wickets in the middle phase, and that's where the middle order batters batted. It's not as if middle order batters batted towards the end.""The thought process was right. When it doesn't work out, these questions are asked often. But I've always believed that if a middle order batter bats as a middle order batter, it is the right decision,"" Nayar said.Nayar believes that the side batting second is under more pressure.""When you are batting first, there is less pressure.
