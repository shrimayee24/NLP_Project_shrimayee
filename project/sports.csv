How and why Rishabh Pant's England tour could come to an abrupt end due to toe fracture

Poll How impressed are you by Rishabh Pant's performance despite his injury? Extremely impressed Somewhat impressed Not very impressed

Around 11 am local time, Rishabh Pant arrived at Old Trafford cricket ground with his injured right foot protected and secured inside a moonboot. He used a crutch for support and slowly made his way to the away dressing room. In lightning quick time, the wicketkeeper-batter changed to the Indian whites and was captured in the balcony behind head coach Gautam Gambhir He had not accompanied the rest of the team in the bus to the ground and it was later revealed by Shardul Thakur that an early hospital visit forced him to arrive nearly two hours later. The visuals of Day 1 were still fresh in everyone's mind and it was difficult to even entertain the outrageous thought of Pant coming out to bat in that condition. The swelling, the bleeding and the inability to put the injured foot down made it impossible to imagine the 27-year-old walking down the staircase from the dressing room to the ground.All heads panned towards the steps when Shardul Thakur was dismissed and the capacity crowd was up on its feet when they saw Pant hobble out to the middle. The scoreboard, the situation of the match and cricket took a backseat because what was unfolding in front of everyone was an exhibition of grit, courage and the desire to contribute for the team.There was a sense of shock in the opposite camp too because they didn't expect Pant to play any part in the Test and him walking out did catch them a bit off guard.He stretched his overnight score of 37 to 54, hit a six off Jofra Archer, limped for singles and gave another example of why impossible is ‘I'm possible’ in Pant's dictionary. If batting with a painful finger at Lord's wasn't enough, the left-hander took it to a different level by batting with a fractured toe. An injury which required him to rest for at least six weeks but all that took a backseat as Pant wanted to score those crucial runs lower down the order.Multiple trips to the hospital and the hours put in by the medical team kept the plan of keeping him ready to bat in place, and there was a lot of excitement in the dressing room. They were aware of the seriousness of the injury but knew the grit would take over.""Everyone was very excited to see how he would approach his innings. And I think what he showed today, the passion he showed for the team is unmatched. We have seen a lot of instances in the past where he has batted in fractures. I think there was a time when Graeme Smith was batting in the South African team. His hand was fractured.""So, in these moments, the grit of the player comes into play. And I think Rishabh's positivity and his grit keeps him away from all the pains and whatever pain he has. His pain bearing capacity is very high. If he is in pain, it is a big injury,"" said Shardul Thakur in the post-day presser.With Pant, it has been the case of grit over matter and will not be a surprise if it remains that way in the second innings too. There is no official word on his participation in the last Test but it is very unlikely.Manchester, however, could see another glimpse of the freak who dances to his own tunes. If the situation demands and the team needs, the crutches will be ditched, the moonboot will come off and he will descend those steps again to give his all for the team. Possibly one last time in the series.",Rishabh Pant came out to bat with a fractured toe on Day 1 of the second Test. The wicketkeeper-batter scored 54 not out and hit a six off Jofra Archer. The 27-year-old is expected to be out for at least six weeks with the injury.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122894641,imgsize-90074,width-400,resizemode-4/122894641.jpg"

However, the counsel informed a bench of Justices Kant and Joymalya Bagchi that the FIR remains illegible despite the best efforts of CFSL.Unwilling to give up the pursuit of delivering justice, the bench asked the Special Investigation Team (SIT) it had constituted to re-investigate anti-Sikh riot cases and UP police to keep the case open and pursue it further whenever they get hold of additional information relating to Diwan Singh's cold-blooded murder.For PIL petitioner Manjit Singh GK, advocate Jagjit Singh Chhabra told the bench though chargesheets were filed by SIT in nine anti-Sikh riots cases in Kanpur, HC has stayed trial in three cases on appeals filed by the accused seeking quashing of the final probe reports.The SC bench said, ""While we do not want to impact the rights of the accused, including their right to seek quashing of chargesheet, we would request HC to take up these appeals out of turn for expeditious adjudication.""","Army man's murder by an anti-Sikh riots mob at Kanpur on Nov 1, 1984, will remain unsolved.

NEW DELHI: Putting all speculation to rest, LJP (Ram Vilas) chief and Union minister Chirag Paswan has said that there will be no repetition of 2020 when his party went solo in the last assembly election in Bihar. He said his party considers all NDA candidates as their own and hence LJP (RV) is ready to put in its entire effort in securing victory for them in all 245 seats in the state.In response to a question on the sidelines of the curtain raiser event of World Food India 2025, Chirag said, “I am reiterating that when I say LJP (RV) will contest all 243 seats, I honestly feel that till you don’t treat all alliance candidates as your own nominees, you can’t achieve the target for which you are working. The NDA alliance is working to win more than 225 seats out of 243. I feel that the candidates of JD(U), BJP and others in the alliance are my candidates. If anyone is feeling happy or enthused that I will repeat the role that I played in 2020 (last assembly election), then there is no reason within the alliance that I get back to that role. The NDA is contesting as a united force.”Responding to another question on whether Jan Suraaj founder Prashant Kishor was hijacking his ‘Bihar first, Bihari first’ plank, the minister said none can hijack or copy the idea of another leader.However, he appreciated Kishor for “making honest efforts” in the interest of Bihar.“Prashant ji is playing an honest role in Bihar politics, which I appreciate. I welcome all who appeal to people to go beyond caste and communal politics...There is nothing wrong when people have more options,” he said.It can be recalled that Chirag had gone solo in 2020 assembly polls and had put up a brave fight in all seats where JD(U) had its candidates.

Shardul Thakur opens up on being under bowled, gives inside details on Rishabh Pant

Poll Should Washington Sundar have been introduced earlier in the match? Yes, he should have. No, it was the right timing.

NEW DELHI: Former India batter Sanjay Manjrekar has questioned Shubman Gill’s captaincy instincts, calling his decision to delay Washington Sundar’s introduction into the attack on Day 3 of the fourth Test in Manchester “a major red flag. ”England, resuming from 225/2, ended the day at a formidable 544/7, taking a 186-run lead and putting India on the back foot. Much of the scrutiny, however, fell on Gill’s choice to wait until the 69th over to bring on off-spinner Sundar — despite the pitch showing signs of turn and India’s pacers struggling to make breakthroughs.Sundar made an immediate impact once introduced, removing Ollie Pope for 71 and then dismissing Harry Brook for just 3 runs. The late double-strike provided India a brief window back into the game, but many questioned why the off-spinner wasn’t used earlier — especially after taking 4/22 in the second innings at Lord’s.Speaking on Star Sports, Manjrekar didn’t mince his words: “So him [Gill] not bowling Washington Sundar… and there's no plausible reason for him to not bowl. I see this as a major red flag with Shubman Gill's, you know, trait as a captain.”Manjrekar further criticised Gill’s preference for sticking with underperforming pacers on a track that clearly offered turn, noting it showed a lack of tactical awareness.Former England pacer Stuart Broad echoed Manjrekar’s sentiments.“Everybody's been saying, where's Washington Sundar? Why are we not seeing him? They're 300-odd for two and we haven't seen the off-spinner who got 4 for 22 in the last innings at Lord's,” Broad remarked on the broadcast.India now face a daunting task on Day 4, with England already firmly in command and Joe Root’s sparkling 150 ensuring the hosts are on track for a series-clinching win.","Former India batter Sanjay Manjrekar has questioned Shubman Gill's captaincy instincts.

Daniel Cormier reveals that Brock Lesnar is banned from TKO



DANIEL CORMIER SOUNDS OFF on JON JONES, ASPINALL, MMA GURU?! | EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW

Will Brock Lesnar return to WWE?



FAQs

Is Brock Lesnar banned from WWE and professional wrestling?



Why was Brock Lesnar’s name linked to the Vince McMahon lawsuit?



When did Brock Lesnar last appear on WWE programming?



Brock Lesnar, once the most dominant force in both WWE and UFC, now finds himself in an unthinkable position. He has been sidelined, silent, and reportedly banned from professional wrestling altogether. As per reports, WWE is distancing itself from Lesnar. Additionally, insiders are dropping cryptic but serious comments, which have extended the speculation. Now the question remains, is this the end of The Beast Incarnate’s career?Daniel Cormier has recently shared up update on Brock Lesnar that put the wrestling world in a frenzy. On The MightyCast with Demetrious Johnson, the former UFC Heavyweight Champion revealed that Brock Lesnar is currently blacklisted from professional wrestling. Though Cormier declined to elaborate, his tone left little room for doubt.“Brock is on the banned list right now,” he said. “Brock got into so much trouble. You know what Brock did. I ain’t telling you on air what Brock did. Brock is in so much trouble.”The remarks come amid the fallout from the high-profile lawsuit filed by former WWE employee Janel Grant, who accused Vince McMahon and others of se*ual misconduct and trafficking.Though Lesnar’s name was initially listed in the documents and later removed, his association with the case has had lasting consequences on his career.In fact, Lesnar hasn't appeared on WWE programming since his loss to Cody Rhodes at SummerSlam 2023. He has been scrubbed from WWE marketing material, future events, and even casual mention by the promotion itself. A source close to the company told multiple outlets that Lesnar is being treated as ""radioactive"" amid ongoing legal uncertainty. It would be a miracle if he can make a return after all this trouble, although never say never.While Lesnar has avoided the spotlight, he was recently spotted in public, looking fitter than ever. Fans shared photos of the 46-year-old taking selfies outside a restaurant, his shredded physique sparking whispers of a potential comeback. When asked about returning to WWE, he reportedly offered a vague reply: “We’ll see.”Still, without a clear path forward and no statement from either WWE or TKO, Lesnar’s future remains up in the air. Though Cormier’s knowledge of WWE’s internal decisions can be debated, the weight of his comments can’t be dismissed lightly, especially when paired with the company’s decision to effectively erase Lesnar from its present and near-future plans.For now, Lesnar’s focus seems to be on family. While The Beast may be lying low, fans and critics alike are left wondering, has the final bell already tolled for Brock Lesnar? So far, it’s hard to tell. Still, many fans would want to see The Beast making his WWE return with a surprise, especially as a worthy opponent of John Cena in his retirement tour. But as for the current situation, at least, according to Cormier, it is far-fetched.Also Read: Roman Reigns Confronts Paul Heyman on Raw to Sow Seeds for a Huge Clash at SummerSlam According to Daniel Cormier, Lesnar is on the ""banned list,"" though WWE hasn’t officially confirmed it.Lesnar was initially named in the lawsuit filed by Janel Grant, who alleged trafficking and misconduct, but his name was later removed.Lesnar hasn’t been seen on WWE TV since his match against Cody Rhodes at SummerSlam 2023.","Daniel Cormier reveals that Brock Lesnar is banned from TKO.

Brock Purdy may be preparing to become a first-time father, but thanks to one teammate’s off-script comment, the world found out before he was ready. In what fans are calling a shocking breach of trust, San Francisco 49ers backup tight end Mason Pline may have just crossed a serious line by leaking private details about Purdy and his wife Jenna’s personal life.During a seemingly harmless interview on 49ers insider Larry Krueger’s YouTube show, Mason Pline let it slip that Purdy has “a baby on the way.” The comment came while joking about Purdy’s Toyota endorsement deals, but quickly became anything but funny.“He’s got a baby on the way, so I’m sure that’s on the back burner,” Pline said casually. But to fans, reporters, and likely Purdy himself, it sounded more like a blindside. The couple had not publicly announced the pregnancy, and Pline, who only signed with the 49ers in 2024 as an undrafted free agent, may have just hijacked one of the most personal moments of Purdy’s life.As of now, Brock and Jenna Purdy have not publicly confirmed the pregnancy.

Hulk Hogan was a giant in his prime years

Hulk Hogan's multiple injuries affected him physically

Terry Bollea, known to the whole wide world as Hulk Hogan , was one of the biggest stars the world of wrestling ever saw, sometimes quite literally. At his prime, standing at a massive height of 6 ft 7 in, which is roughly around 201 cm tall, he was one of the tallest stars in the in-ring game who was a regular participant for decades. While he retired in 2012 from being an active wrestler, Hogan was still a part of the WWE until his last day. Unfortunately, the veteran star passed away in the morning of July 24, bidding goodbye to the world of wrestling forever. Hulk Hogan was one of the tallest stars who played an active part in the world of wrestling. While not the tallest ever, that spot definitely belongs to Giant Gonzalez, who stood at a monstrous height of 8 ft, he was still up there. At 6 ft 7 in, Hogan was one of the tallest stars with a long-standing career, despite his hulking physique. In his prime, he even hulked over Lou Ferrigno , star of the 1970s television series, The Incredible Hulk.Allegedly, when Hulk was working the wrestling circuit in Memphis, he appeared on a local talk show alongside Ferrigno, who was 6 ft 5 in or 196 cm tall. Side by side, Hulk Hogan easily dwarfed the man who was supposed to be playing the biggest Avenger at the time. Weighing 295 pounds (134 kg) with 24-inch (61 cm) biceps, his physique was a true marvel that had fans all over the world cheering for him. With such an expansive career, he was regarded as the most recognized wrestler in the world.Several injuries and surgeries led to Hulk Hogan losing a few inches later in life. Being one of the biggest stars in wrestling meant working a lot over the years, which unfortunately, led to many health issues for the Hulkster. He had over 25 surgeries in his lifetime, and even lost a couple of inches because of problems in his spine.Hogan has had over a dozen back surgeries, neck surgeries, and knee surgeries. Also, rumor has it that 3 or so of his vertebrae shrank because of multiple injuries, which led to his losing a few inches of height. And of course, with age too, he was bound to lose some. At the end of the line, it was assumed that he was around 6 ft 4 in.Also Read: Hulk Hogan's car collection was just like him - muscly and loud - adding to his impressive net worth","Terry Bollea, known to the whole wide world as Hulk Hogan, was one of the biggest stars the world of wrestling ever saw, sometimes quite literally.

FAQs

How many carries did Bijan Robinson have in 2024?

How many missed tackles did Bijan Robinson force in 2024?

How many rushing yards did Bijan Robinson have in the 2024 season?

Bijan Robinson, the running back for the Atlanta Falcons, is creating quite a stir. After an outstanding 2024 season in which he totaled 1,887 yards from scrimmage, Robinson has made it onto the renowned NFL Top 100 Players list at No. 62. Yet, the most striking comment came from Philadelphia Eagles superstar Saquon Barkley, who didn’t just compliment Robinson he also sent out a “scary” warning to the league about the young player’s capabilities.Every year, the NFL unveils its Top 100 Players list, chosen by the players themselves, just ahead of the season kickoff. This time around, Robinson made his first entry on the list, highlighting his increasing influence. When the NFL Top 100 countdown was revealed, Saquon Barkley, who just had a remarkable 2024 season, stepped into the limelight to cheer on Robinson.“There’s nobody who’s able to cut like Bijan in the NFL. There’s not,” Barkley declared, speaking directly on the NFL’s official broadcast. “You can go argue with your mom about that to be honest. … Trust me, I love myself and I think I have great cuts. His vision, his agility, and he can catch the ball too.It’s finna get scary for a lot of people.”That's a big shout-out from a dude who really gets how to run the ball. Barkley, the 2024 Offensive Player of the Year, has made history as just the ninth player in the NFL to rush for over 2,000 yards in one season.Bijan Robinson's 2024 season was absolutely thrilling. In his second year with the Falcons, the 23-year-old rushed for 1,456 yards and scored 14 touchdowns on 304 attempts, ranking third in the NFL for rushing yards, just behind Barkley and Derrick Henry.But that’s not all. Robinson also caught 61 passes for 431 yards, bringing his total scrimmage yards to an impressive 1,887—making it the fourth-best in the league.He really showed off his skills, whether it was shaking off defenders on the ground or grabbing passes from the backfield. Pro Football Focus noted that he forced 70 missed tackles, proving the agility and vision Barkley talked about. That performance got him a Pro Bowl nod and confirmed his place as one of the top young stars in the league.Robinson still believes there's room for improvement.

This is quite different from Barkley, who had seven runs of 40+ yards in 2024.With rookie Michael Penix Jr. taking over as the starting quarterback, the Falcons are expected to depend a lot on Robinson to power the offense. A strong running game can relieve some pressure from a young QB, and Robinson has proven he can handle it.

Shaquille O'Neal sparks controversy over less paying WNBA salaries,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/shaquille-oneal-sparks-controversy-over-less-paying-wnba-salaries/articleshow/122904697.cms,"Via Getty Images: Shaquille O’Neal

Shaquille O'Neal wants to bridge the gap between the NBA and WNBA players' salaries

Why The WNBA Isn't Profitable Despite Record-Breaking Year

“Pay them what they’re worth,“I’ve played at the highest level. I know talent when I see it.”

The backlash and bigger implications of Shaquille O'Neal's thoughts

Shaquille O'Neal has ignited a fiery discussion on the stark pay disparity between NBA and WNBA players, calling the gap not just unfair but outright unacceptable. Shocked by the salaries of WNBA stars, Shaq proposed a controversial solution: slightly lowering the rim in the WNBA to boost dunks, highlight plays, and fan engagement. His goal is to make the game more marketable, drive revenue, and justify higher player salaries.During a recent interview with Bailey Jackson, Shaq’s idea draws parallels to sports like golf, where adjustments like closer tee-offs exist to enhance play without diminishing skill. He argues that tweaking the WNBA’s product could draw more viewers, boost profits, and fund salaries that reflect players’ worth. Whether you agree or not, Shaq’s outspoken stance has thrust the WNBA’s pay issue into the spotlight, demanding a broader conversation about equity in professional sports is what all he meant. He points to stark numbers: A’ja Wilson earns roughly $200,000 annually, Caitlin Clark around $80,000, while Stephen Curry rakes in $55 million a season , more in one game than Wilson earns in two years. Clark and Angel Reese combined wouldn’t approach Curry’s payday over multiple seasons. He’s not alone in noting the pay gap; the numbers speak volumes, with top WNBA salaries dwarfed by NBA earnings.Social media erupted, with supporters praising his intent and critics arguing it undermines female athletes’ prowess. Shaq, however, insists it’s about amplifying the game’s appeal, not questioning talent. Not everyone embraces Shaq’s rim-lowering proposal. Some WNBA players and fans argue it implies women need assistance to match the NBA’s excitement, potentially devaluing their athleticism. Critics see it as a misguided fix that shifts focus from systemic issues like unequal media coverage and sponsorship deals to altering the game itself.Shaq counters that his suggestion isn’t about diminishing talent but about creating a product that draws more eyes and revenue, ultimately benefiting players. Shaq’s call-out isn’t aimed at the athletes but at a system that fails to reward them commensurately. His idea, while divisive, underscores a shared goal: elevating WNBA stars like Wilson, Clark, and Reese to household names with paychecks to match. Love or hate the rim idea, Shaq’s advocacy amplifies a critical issue.The debate he’s sparked isn’t just about rims it’s about fairness, visibility, and the future of women’s sports, with a larger-than-life ally pushing for change.Also read:","Shaquille O'Neal has ignited a fiery discussion on the stark pay disparity between NBA and WNBA players.

FAQs

Q: When will the Browns wear the new 'Alpha Dawg' helmets?

Q: Has Cleveland ever worn brown helmets before?

Q: Why don’t the Browns have a logo on their helmets?

The Cleveland Browns are once again turning heads with their choice of helmet. On Wednesday, the team unveiled an all-new alternate helmet design that will debut during the 2025 NFL season. Dubbed the ‘Alpha Dawg,’ this fresh look features a matte brown finish with orange striping – a dramatic change from the team’s traditional bright orange shells. It's the first time the Browns have ever introduced brown helmets in their history, adding a new chapter to a franchise known for its otherwise minimalist style.For a team that prides itself on tradition – and whose primary helmet has gone largely untouched for decades – the introduction of the ‘Alpha Dawg’ is a surprising but possibly intentional move. According to the Browns, this helmet is more than just a visual refresh. It's designed to reflect the toughness and leadership the team hopes to embody on the field. “‘Alpha Dawg’ embodies what we set out to be as the Cleveland Browns, the leaders of the pack. We’re excited about this new alternate helmet and the ode it pays to the rich history of the color brown as part of our organization, switching it up from our iconic orange helmets,” said JW Johnson, the team's executive vice president.The Browns will wear the new helmets three times during the upcoming season, pairing them with brown jerseys and pants for a full monochrome, yet impactful look. This will mark a stark contrast from the club’s usual aesthetic, which has centered around the orange helmets since 1952.While the Browns have never featured a logo on their helmets – a point of pride for the franchise – they have experimented more with helmet color in recent years. Over the past two seasons, the team occasionally wore white throwback helmets, a subtle nod to their roots in the All-America Football Conference and early NFL days (1950–51). Then they switched to orange in 1952 – the style that's remained largely unchanged until now.Despite their historical significance, the white alternates didn’t bring much luck on the field. The Browns went just 2-4 in games wearing them, including the Week 2 contest in 2023 when star running back Nick Chubb suffered a rather serious knee injury.The Browns partnered with DUDE Wipes to promote the helmet launch, a branding choice that quickly caught the attention of fans across the internet. Known for its fun and offbeat tone, DUDE Wipes leaned all the way in. “As the kings of keeping things clean, we're here to back the Browns as they embrace a bold new look this season − with the launch of their all-brown alternate helmets,” said DUDE Wipes co-founder and CMO Ryan Meegan. “We're pumped to team up with the Browns for one of the most iconic helmet reveals the league has ever seen.”A: The Cleveland Browns plan to wear the new brown helmets three times during the 2025 NFL season, pairing them with matching brown jerseys and pants.A: No. Despite being founded in 1946, this marks the first time the Browns have introduced brown helmets as part of their uniform.A: The Browns are the only NFL team with plain helmets. It’s part of their longstanding tradition and minimalist brand identity, and even with alternate designs, they’ve kept it that way.Also read: Cardi B sued for assault and battery after Vegas mic-throwing incident as fans question her relationship with Stefon Diggs",Cleveland Browns unveil first-ever alternate helmet for 2025.

Maddison Hill lays out her “Brady is Kim’s type” theory



“I do think Tom Brady is somebody who Kim Kardashian would like, just because he is good‑looking, he is successful, he is motivated, he is in the right circles, he is well‑connected.”

Kim Kardashian BITTER over Tom Brady REJECTION? Hailey Bieber comments on CRAZY life w/ Justin +MORE

No, they’re not together and that’s the point



Why fans are eating this up anyway



FAQs:

1. Who is Maddison Hill?

2. Did Maddison Hill say Tom Brady and Kim Kardashian are dating?

3. Has Tom Brady commented on Kim Kardashian?

Before the dating rumors start swirling again, let’s clear the air, Tom Brady and Kim Kardashian are not dating. But that hasn’t stopped entertainment host Maddison Hill from playing a little matchmaker in the public sphere. In her recent YouTube video , Hill explained why she thinks the former NFL superstar and reality TV queen would actually make the perfect couple, if it ever happened.Maddison Hill, known for her YouTube and social media commentary on celebrity life, recently gave her take on one of Hollywood’s most talked-about hypotheticals: What if Tom Brady and Kim Kardashian ever dated?Hill’s thoughts came during her recent YouTube video, where she explained:In other words, Tom checks all the boxes. Looks? Check. Fame? Big check. Elite connections? Yup. Ambition? Obviously.Here’s what makes Hill’s commentary ethical and fun, it’s just that: commentary. There’s no claim of insider info, no “source says they’re texting,” and zero paparazzi pics to overanalyze. Hill is offering a hypothetical, much like how fans pair off celebs in imaginary rom-com scenarios.While Kim and Tom were loosely linked in tabloids last year mainly after being spotted at the same event, they’ve never confirmed anything romantic.In fact, Brady was more recently linked to Sofía Vergara, which some fans speculated may have caused a bit of side-eye from Kim’s camp. But again, pure speculation, never addressed by either party.It’s not hard to see why the idea of Kim K and Tom Brady as a power couple keeps popping up in pop culture circles. They’re both massively successful, good-looking, and iconic in their respective worlds. Add Maddison Hill’s playful commentary into the mix, and the internet has another “what if” pairing to swoon or roll their eyes over.But let’s be clear: this isn’t a rumor, it’s just a vibe.Maddison Hill gave fans something to laugh and think about with her take, but it’s not confirmation of anything brewing between Kim and Tom. It's simply what it is, a media personality giving her read on what could work, not what is happening.So until we see them holding hands courtside (unlikely), take this one as a fun bit of celeb matchmaking, not TMZ breaking news.Maddison Hill is an entertainment host and commentator known for her YouTube and social media presence where she covers celebrity culture and Hollywood gossip.No. Maddison Hill gave her opinion on why Tom Brady would be a good match for Kim Kardashian, but she did not claim they are dating.No, Tom Brady has never publicly commented on any romantic link to Kim Kardashian.Also read - “Disgusting behavior”: Ja’Marr Chase’s viral hand placement on his girlfriend has fans spiraling and screaming","Maddison Hill is an entertainment host and commentator known for her YouTube and social media presence where she covers celebrity culture and Hollywood gossip.

Why did the Buffalo Bills sign Joey Bosa despite his injury history?

How are the Bills managing Joey Bosa’s health during training camp?

What impact can Joey Bosa have on the Bills' defense in 2025?

Buffalo Bills’ defensive goals for 2025



The Buffalo Bills have opened their 2025 training camp with a major focus on integrating Pro Bowl edge rusher Joey Bosa into the defense. After signing him in the offseason, the team is carefully managing his workload to ensure he stays healthy and productive throughout the season.Joey Bosa, a four-time Pro Bowler with 72 career sacks, has struggled to stay healthy throughout his NFL career. He has completed just two full seasons in nine years, a risk the Bills acknowledged when signing him. Defensive coordinator Bobby Babich emphasized that the team has a plan to manage his reps during camp.“We have an approach to make sure he’s healthy,” Babich said. The goal is to have Bosa at full strength when the regular season begins and throughout a potential playoff run.Despite injury concerns, Bosa remains one of the league’s most disruptive pass rushers when on the field. In 2024, he played 14 games, recorded five sacks and five tackles for loss, and earned another Pro Bowl selection. His best season came in 2019, when he tallied 11.5 sacks and 18 tackles for loss. He also won Defensive Rookie of the Year in 2016. The Bills are hoping he can replicate that level of impact while avoiding extended time on the sideline.The Bills signed Joey Bosa to strengthen their pass rush and bring veteran leadership to the defense. While his injury history is a concern, his high-impact performances when healthy made him a calculated risk for a team aiming for a Super Bowl push.Defensive coordinator Bobby Babich confirmed that Bosa’s reps are being carefully monitored. The team has a structured plan to manage his workload to ensure he stays healthy and ready for the regular season.If Bosa remains healthy, he can significantly boost Buffalo’s defensive line by improving quarterback pressure and supporting younger players. His experience and production make him a potential game-changer for the Bills’ 2025 playoff hopes.With veterans like Von Miller nearing the end of their careers, Bosa’s presence gives the Bills a reliable pass-rushing option if he remains healthy. The defense will depend on him to generate pressure, support the younger core, and step up in critical moments. By limiting his training camp reps and focusing on long-term availability, the Bills are positioning Bosa to be a central figure in their 2025 campaign.Also Read: Dylan Raiola mirrors Patrick Mahomes like Kobe Bryant did Michael Jordan ahead of Arrowhead Season opener As training camp progresses, all eyes will be on Joey Bosa’s health and performance.

In the world of console-wars, PlayStation and Xbox are the two names that have held their grounds firm since their launches. This is one of the very few “Messi-Ronaldo” like debates that divides the world into two parts.Be it superior hardwares, or better value-for-money subscription models, both consoles always get an edge over each other. However, the major distinctive factor has to be “console exclusivity.” But that thin line is diminishing slowly, and another Xbox-exclusive title might influence this process later this year.It was 2024 when the term “console-exclusivity” slowly started to perish as major Xbox-exclusive titles like Hi-Fi Rush, Pentiment, and many others made their way on to PlayStation 5. Similar efforts were put by Sony as well when popular PlayStation-exclusive titles like Helldivers 2 , Indiana Jones and the Great Circle were released on Xbox. Now, it seems another hugely popular Xbox-first party title, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, might land in the arch rival camp.With the major first-party titles getting released on rival platforms becoming a trend recently, the arrival of MFS2024 on PS5 was quite evident, and rumors were already spreading around the internet. Now, a recent claim by credible leaker NateTheHate solidifies those rumors to a greater extent.Recently, a fan on Twitter asked NateTheHate about the potential release of MFS2024 on PlayStation 5. The leaker replied back with the confirmation about the query. Not only that, he also gave a probable release window of 2025. According to him, PlayStation fans might see MFS2024 surfacing on their platform around the completion of one year of its actual release, which is on November 19, 2024.If Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 really lands on PlayStation 5, that would really open the floodgate from both sides as MFS2024 is surely one of the biggest first-party Xbox titles.

Pittsburgh Penguins require upside, and Lukas Reichel fits the profile

Chicago Blackhawks Looking To Trade Lukas Reichel? | Potential Offseason Trade Packages

Rationale behind making the trade



FAQs

Q1: Has Reichel been officially placed on the block?

Q2: What would Reichel do on the Penguins?

Q3: Could a change in scenery be a catalyst for Reichel to start playing better?

As the Pittsburgh Penguins retool their core, in addition to possible trades with regard to some veteran assets like Erik Karlsson and Bryan Rust, they should also evaluate fresh prospects for their future. One fella that stands out is Chicago Blackhawks forward Lukas Reichel. At 23 years old, Reichel hasn't found his stride with Chicago, but given his raw talent and his first-round pedigree, he might shine in a steadier setting such as the one in Pittsburgh.The Pittsburgh Penguins are at a crossroads, one that asks whether they decide to fully rebuild or simply retool around their aging stars. For whichever path they pursue, however, Lukas Reichel certainly represents a low-risk, high-reward proposition. Last season, for instance, he only had 22 points in 70 games, but you can't just cast away the flashes of offensive brilliance he has shown in the past. He scored 15 points in just 23 games in the 2022–23 season, which means he still obviously has untapped scoring potential that Pittsburgh can help to unlock.The kid was once considered the great hope for the Chicago pipeline. However, due to an inconsistent deployment and the general struggles of the Blackhawks attempting to rebuild, Reichel has been unable to solidify himself in a top-six role.Pittsburgh offers a somewhat more veteran-led environment and structured system, and this might be just the trigger he needs in his development.The Penguins cannot simply look to shed contracts; they need to build a bridge to the future. Lukas Reichel fits into that; he is under a controllable contract and is still years away from his prime. Unlike a rental player, Reichel can grow alongside the team but also contributes at the highest NHL level right away. This trade would likely not require giving up anything premium-child fare; a mid-round pick or a somewhat secondary prospect would most likely suffice, making it a very appealing risk.Something about Chicago just didn't click with Reichel, so a change of scenery might be just what he needs. From Pittsburgh's standpoint, it's about investing in someone who may be on the brink of blossoming, especially if surrounded by experienced creators like Sidney Crosby or Evgeni Malkin.Also Read: Matthew Tkachuk and Ellie O’Connell celebrate their wedding with grandeur weeks after the Stanley Cup win For a team balancing the old and the new, Reichel represents a clever, forward-thinking acquisition. With little risk and extraordinary upside, he just might be the missing piece in this retooling.Ans: No, not officially, though several sources have stated that the Blackhawks are willing to move him.Ans: Probably middle-six forward, with a chance to move up if he ever discovers his scoring touch.Ans: Yes, many feel that a more structured environment, supported by veterans, might be what Reichel's game has needed.",Lukas Reichel could be a smart long-term bet for the Pittsburgh Penguins amid roster revamp.

Bronny James, the young talent of the Los Angeles Lakers, may not be ready to put his sneakers away just yet this summer. After a solid performance in the 2025 Las Vegas Summer League, the 20-year-old rookie could be preparing for a late showing in the Drew League, which is one of the most legendary pro-am basketball circuits. Recently, Drew League commissioner Dino Smiley teased this possibility during an interview with Mark Medina, stating, ""I’ve heard Bronny, but nothing clear on that yet. I heard Bronny might play. But nothing concrete."".The Drew League is way more than a simple summer pickup game—it’s a beloved part of Los Angeles with a rich history in the basketball community. It started in 1973 with just six teams and has transformed into a stage for some of the sport's biggest stars.It is held in South central LA when the league has become a trackhot in the summer with high school students, college and NBA stars with time to practice in the less than ideal conditions with competition. Throughout the years, it has been home to such legends as Kobe Bryant, Kevin Durant, and Chris Paul, meaning that it is a real test of talent and homage to the hoops culture.The memorable moments of the Drew league occurred in 2022 when the father of Bronny, LeBron James, appeared at a pro-am barely.LeBron (MMV Cheaters) got 42 points and grabbed 16 rebounds with DeMar DeRozan in their 104-102 victory over Black Pearl Elite after a decade and a half absence in such games.The crowd went crazy, and this moment really established the Drew League as a venue for basketball greatness. Just earlier this month, Bronny paid homage to that game by wearing the same Nike LeBron 20s his dad wore back in 2022 during his California Classic games.This summer, Bronny James has been making significant progress, showing that he’s more than just LeBron’s son—he’s a player with his own potential. In the 2025 Las Vegas Summer League, he averaged 14.2 points while shooting 47.6 percent and also recorded 3.8 assists over four games.This was a clear improvement from his rookie season with the Lakers, where he played in 27 games and averaged a modest 2.3 points per game. While those early NBA stats were quite humble, they marked the start of his journey, and his Summer League performance suggests he’s starting to find his groove.With the Drew League on the way, Bronny has a chance to keep that momentum going. Dino Smiley’s comments to Mark Medina of RG.org have ignited some speculation — “I’ve heard Bronny might play,” Smiley said, though he cautioned that nothing is set in stone.Also Read: “It ain't like I'm a small guy” — Markieff Morris dares Nikola Jokic’s MMA-trained brothers to box
