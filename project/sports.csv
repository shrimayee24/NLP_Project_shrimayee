The gust of boycott wind around the India vs Pakistan Asia Cup clash has made its way into the Indian dressing room.TimesofIndia.com can confirm that the players had a long conversation with head coach Gautam Gambhir and other support staff, with questions swirling far beyond the boundary rope.The players have been told to stay professional and take the match just like any other. But can they?It is a young team, with most of the cricketers keeping tabs on social media the moment they get their phones back after an intensive net session. They are professionals, but they too were shaken during the border skirmish between the two countries in May, and now with the calls for boycott in the backdrop.Also See: IND vs PAK Live Score, Asia Cup 2025 The tension can be sensed, as ahead of a big match like this, neither the head coach, captain nor any player came for the pre-match press conference.On the eve of the match, India’s assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate was asked if players would be carrying the sentiments of a wounded public.He replied: ""Yes, I think they will.""It is a very sensitive issue. I have no doubt the players share the compassion and feelings of the vast majority of the Indian public. The Asia Cup was in limbo for a long period of time and we were just waiting.""We didn’t think we were going to be coming at one stage. But obviously, you know what the government’s stance is.Now the team, particularly the players, have to put their sentiments and emotions behind,"" he added.The Dutch coach later admitted that the team did go into a huddle on Saturday and addressed the situation in the team meeting.""We’re aware of people’s feelings. At the same time, we will put it behind us and the guys will get a chance to play for their country again tomorrow. They will be as professional and focused as they can be given the circumstances,"" he said.Ryan ten Doeschate discovered how India vs Pakistan begins long before the first ball.His face often slipped into a void of expression, his silences dragging longer than comfort allowed, each word measured as if it carried the weight of a landmine. In real time, he was discovering that India-Pakistan cricket is never merely a game; it is a battlefield disguised as sport.""I guess the other side of the argument is that you separate sport from politics, and people have got different opinions on that. Hopefully the way we play can represent how we feel about the country,"" he said.""I understand the position and, like I explained, the sentiment, but we are following the direction of what the BCCI and the Indian government have decided is right for the country at the moment.""This will be ten Doeschate’s second India-Pakistan match. It was in Dubai that he first tasted the rivalry during the Champions Trophy earlier this year.When coaxed about whether there was anything different in preparation, he said:""I will be honest, no. I was expecting a lot more needle during the Champions Trophy game, and I didn’t really feel that either. The preparation or focus hasn’t been any different to any other important game. Pakistan has also started to come to terms with how they want to play T20 cricket. So it’s going to be a slightly different challenge compared to the last 24 months. We want to focus on what we are doing and how we want to play.""Ten Doeschate had survived the press conference, and before signing off, revealed coach Gautam Gambhir’s message to his team ahead of the clash.""We obviously are aware of the sentiments and the strong feelings. And Gauti’s message has just been very professional about not worrying about things that are not in our control.""Just trying to be emotionless when approaching the cricket side of things. The guys are professional enough now. I’m sure individuals have different levels of feeling on the spectrum of where they feel the whole situation is. But the messaging has been to just focus on the cricket and try to just focus on the one game tomorrow.""Whoever wins the match on Sunday, one thing is for sure: the India-Pakistan rivalry has been reignited. Yes, it has lost some flair; the cricket is trying to serve as a stage, but the play is stretching far beyond it.",India face Pakistan in the Asia Cup on Sunday in Dubai. India's assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate says players will carry sentiments of a wounded public. He says the team did go into a huddle on Saturday and addressed the situation in the team meeting.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123880932,imgsize-38500,width-400,resizemode-4/team-india.jpg"
Mystery of Agatha Christie's India story finally solved,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mystery-of-agatha-christies-india-story-finally-solved/articleshow/123877784.cms,"Agatha Christie autographs copies of her books

WHY DIDN’T THEY ASK MATHEW? There was constant speculation over whether Agatha Christie ever came to India, but never any proof, even though she was known to be an avid traveller. Now, her grandson tells writer Manjiri Prabhu that she definitely had visited — not once, but twice

Mathew Prichard (also in photo right), who’s settled the India question once and for all, with his grandmother Agatha Christie

The following are extracts from two letters that Christie wrote to Edmund Cork in Cyprus, her literary agent and lifelong friend.

Jan 11, 1960 |

Jan 20, 1960 |

Another letter was from Christie, then staying at the Ashoka Hotel in New Delhi, to Rosalind, her daughter.

Feb 16, 1960 |

Oct 30, 1961 |

From Delhi, she wrote again to Rosalind.

Some mysteries need to be actively cracked, but some solve themselves with time.There has been constant speculation about Agatha Christie’s India connection. One question has recurred over the years, but has never really been accurately answered: did Agatha Christie ever visit India? The internet and popular belief will state that she did not. I, too, had often puzzled over how Christie, a world traveller, had never actually been to India. In fact, in a video in 2021, I had even concluded that she indeed hadn’t.Until one cool but sunny Easter day in Wales.In March 2024, I met Christie’s grandson, Mathew Prichard, and his lovely wife Lucy, at their charming home in Wales. Prichard, now in his 80s, had been very close to his grandmother.It was a memorable day, but it turned momentous when Mathew showed me Christie’s personal memorabilia — her passports, her first typed and edited manuscripts, rare photos, her camera, and her last portrait painting, which hung on one of the walls of his house.When Mathew signed and gifted me a copy of his grandmother’s latest biography, I also realised what a mammoth task he had been entrusted with — to preserve her legacy, and how he had upheld that trust: a proud grandson of the Queen of Crime.It was when I mentioned how strange it was that Christie had never visited India, that he glanced at me with a twinkle in his blue eyes, and said, “Oh, but she did!” I was startled. This was contrary to all that we believed. A few minutes later, as I skimmed through the numerous black-and-white, well-preserved photos, I found some that made my heart race — pictures of Christie with a garland, descending from an Indian Airlines plane. Here, finally, was the missing link to a long-standing puzzle.I was on the threshold of solving a real mystery, but I needed to know more. At my request, the archivist Joseph Keogh dug deeper and came up with some fascinating, unpublicised facts. Christie had indeed visited India — not once, but twice. From her passport stamps, he traced her travel itinerary for the two trips.Her first trip was in Jan 1960, when she visited Ceylon (present-day Sri Lanka), then India and Pakistan. From Jan 11 to Feb 2, she travelled to Bombay (now Mumbai), headed to South India’s Madras (now Chennai), did some sightseeing at the Ajanta Caves, and then on to Delhi. Between Feb 2 and 9, she went to Nepal and returned to Patna and Delhi, finally leaving for Karachi on Feb 17.Some letters were also found that referenced her trips. It appeared that the 1960 trip was for a lecture tour by her second husband, the archaeologist Max Mallowan.Future plans are, roughly, leave for Madras today — go via southern India to Bombay arriving 17th or 18th — Then some sightseeing near Bombay Agenta Caves (sic) etc and on to Delhi and then to Nepal on Jan 31st for a week — c/o British Embassy would find us there as I’m not sure what the hotel is.Our plans are a bit different at the moment as accommodation at hotels is very hard to get exactly when one wants it but we shall be in and out of the Ashoka Hotel at Delhi between Jan 28th and Feb 2nd — and then Nepal (c/o British Embassy Kathmandu) 2nd to 9th then in and out of Ashoka again finally leaving it on Feb 17th for Karachi. So forward anything you think I ought to see to the Ashoka at Delhi — but nothing that I needn’t!!On our arrival here yesterday evening, several archaeologists were waiting with two porters and loads of archaeological material from their… dig. The examination of same intrigued the Ashoka guests very much.Christie’s second trip to India, a year later, seemed to be for leisure. The passport has a Palam, New Delhi stamp (month not specified) in 1961. This time she visited Srinagar in Kashmir and stayed at the Oberoi Palace. This is what she wrote to her daughter Rosalind:Lake and mountains rather lovely. This is a Hotel rather like at Jaipur — converted Rajah’s Palace — miles and miles of corridors — enormous rooms and we are in a kind of supersuite looking over lake. It’s all terribly dried up by this time of year — one ought really to come in May-June. Now one must be content by rich beds of red salvia and dahlias in the Hotel garden. Temp is about 50 at night. Delicious hot sun to sit in and about 60 in day. Suits me very well. We made some excursions — to the various Mogul gardens — and to a lake… which is very beautiful and ringed with snowclad mountains. You can see the mountains now after the rain. We have to leave here and go to the Hotel in the town — but expect that our booking for Nov 2nd to Delhi will be all right.Here we are in the Ashoka. I’m glad we had a good ten days and in a perfect Hotel for old ladies (very few of them nowadays) where I could sit, in the sun — and look at a view like a Japanese print. Lovely! The letters revealed Christie’s bright, chirpy personality and tongue-in-cheek humour, her eagerness to explore India and her appreciation of scenic beauty. She seemed happy to be in India.But I pondered why her trips were not well-known. Was it because photographs were a rarity then or because she checked into the hotels in her husband’s name — or perhaps simply because Agatha Christie was a private person?Whatever the reason, I was thrilled with my discovery. That sunny day with Mathew, Lucy and Gwynnie the dog carried an extra fulfilling zing because of this exciting revelation.I had always sensed a deep connection to Agatha Christie. But being the chosen one to unravel the mystery of her India trips felt truly special.The author is an award-winning writer of mystery novels[Extracts and photographs used with permission from Mathew Prichard and The Christie Archive Trust.

Lords Of The Rings: Fighting adversity with kicks & punches,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lords-of-the-rings-fighting-adversity-with-kicks-punches/articleshow/123887829.cms,"The sound of gloves striking pads, spinning back fists slicing through the air, and sharp axe kicks snapping against shields fills the training hall in Kolathur, where a group of Chennai's youngsters practise daily. For them, kickboxing is more than jab-cross drills and roundhouse kicks; it is a battle against financial struggles and a path towards sporting glory.Together, these teenagers have stacked up an impressive medal tally - multiple state golds, national silvers, bronzes, and even international podium finishes. ""Their haul includes international medals across prestigious events such as Turkey Kickboxing World Cup (2023), Uzbekistan Kickboxing World Cup (2024) and Open International Championship in Delhi (2025),"" said C Suresh Babu, chief coach of the Indian kickboxing team.Among the youngsters is M Dharshan (14), a Class 9 student of Don Bosco, Villivakkam. His father, J Murali, is a fish seller at Kolathur, and his mother, M Kamatchi, a homemaker. Known for sharp front kicks that unsettle opponents, the boy has already won a bronze at the 2025 International Championship in Delhi, along with other state and national medals. ""I have been training in kickboxing for four years.

""I lost my father when I was young. My mother, M Bhuvana, works as a domestic help. Despite her meagre salary, she encourages me to train in kickboxing,"" he said. From Perungalathur, Bharth Vishnu S (17), son of a daily wage labourer, has dominated the ring with state and national golds and international triumphs, including a gold in Turkiye.Siblings Jeevitha BM (14) and Yogesh BM (16) of Nazareth Matric Higher Secondary School sharpen their skills side by side.

Shedeur Sanders avoids straight answer on Ravens draft rumors following Browns’ embarrassing loss to division rivals,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/shedeur-sanders-avoids-straight-answer-on-ravens-draft-rumors-following-browns-embarrassing-loss-to-division-rivals/articleshow/123889623.cms,"Shedeur Sanders avoids addressing Ravens draft rumors (Getty Images)

Shedeur Sanders draft decision raises eyebrows



Did Sanders make the right call with the Browns?



When Week 2 of the NFL season kicked off, the drama was already in full swing. ESPN’s Adam Schefter dropped a bombshell: the Baltimore Ravens had planned to draft Shedeur Sanders in the fifth round of April’s draft before the young quarterback made it clear he wanted no part of Baltimore. Hours later, Sanders and his Cleveland Browns were handed a lopsided 41-17 loss to those very Ravens, sparking fresh questions about what might have been.According to Schefter, the Ravens were ready to use the 141st overall pick on Sanders. But the Colorado star reportedly told the team he didn’t want to sit behind Lamar Jackson, a two-time MVP with one of the most secure jobs in football. “Before the Ravens could turn in the card, the former Colorado star let it be known to Baltimore that he didn't want to be on a roster with Lamar Jackson,” Schefter reported.That bold move paved Sanders’ path to Cleveland, who traded up three spots later to grab him. Yet when asked about the reports after Sunday’s defeat, Sanders chose not to dig into the past. “My response is I’m focused on the now,” Sanders said via Cleveland.com. “I don’t really talk about anything in the past and whatever happened in the past, it is what it is. I’m more focused on now and I’m more focused on this game we just had and figuring out how to move forward from that.Pressed further, Sanders leaned on humor and deflection: “You wouldn’t believe my memory don’t even go back that far. I don’t remember anything post-draft. I remember I’m here, I go to practice every day and there’s a 24-hour rule.”The Browns may not be the powerhouse the Ravens are, but Sanders’ road to playing time is much clearer in Cleveland. Veteran Joe Flacco is 40, and rookie Dillon Gabriel already leapfrogged Sanders for the backup role after a sharp preseason showing. If Flacco falters or the Browns stumble out of playoff contention, the door could open for Sanders sooner rather than later.Still, some argue Baltimore would have offered more stability and long-term growth under John Harbaugh. For now, Sanders must prove he made the right call. If his talent shines, the Browns could finally stabilize their long-shaky quarterback future. If not, Cleveland risks reliving a familiar cycle.Also Read: Eagles escape with narrow 20-17 win over Chiefs after Travis Kelce’s late blunder costs Kansas City dearly","Shedeur Sanders was set to be drafted by the Baltimore Ravens in the fifth round of the NFL draft.

Michael Penix Jr. earns starting nod after late-season surge

Kirk Cousins remains a high-paid backup with experience on standby



The Atlanta Falcons are facing the Minnesota Vikings in Week 2 of the 2025 NFL season, but all eyes won’t be on Kirk Cousins. Instead, the spotlight belongs to rookie Michael Penix Jr. , who has been named the Falcons’ starting quarterback over the veteran signal-caller. This shift marks a new chapter for Atlanta as they embrace younger talent in a key position.Despite his high-profile four-year, $180 million contract, Cousins found himself relegated to backup duty following a rough end to the 2024 season. Over a five-game stretch, Cousins completed just 62.7% of his passes, threw one touchdown against nine interceptions, and saw the Falcons go 1-4.Falcons coach Raheem Morris explained the move, saying, ""After review we have made the decision Michael Penix will be the Atlanta Falcons starting quarterback moving forward. This was a football decision and we are fully focused on preparing the team for Sunday's game against the New York Giants.""Penix, in limited action, showed promise with 775 passing yards, three touchdowns, and three interceptions over three games.The Falcons evidently felt that the rookie’s performance and potential warranted the starting role, a decision that has reshaped the team’s quarterback dynamics for the season.While Cousins no longer starts, his presence on the roster remains significant. The 37-year-old veteran brings experience and leadership to the sidelines, ready to step in if needed. During his first year with the Falcons, he finished 14 starts with a 7-7 record, 3,508 passing yards, 18 touchdowns, and 16 interceptions. Though his passer rating of 88.6 was below the league average, his knowledge and ability to mentor a young quarterback like Penix remain valuable assets.Also Read: Which NFL teams observed a moment of silence for Charlie Kirk amid nationwide mourning in Week 2?

Dan Campbell wants to win against his friend Ben Johnson while the Chicago Bears’ head coach aims for a quick turnaround in Detroit

Super Bowl hopes for the Detroit Lions vs questions about Ben Johnson’s role as Bears head coach

Also Read:

Back in May, Jeffri Chadiha of NFL Network mentioned one of the three biggest takeaways for the Chicago Bears—“Ben Johnson’s reunion comes early: It won’t take long for the new Bears head coach to meet up with his former team. The ex-Lions offensive coordinator will see Detroit in Week 2 in what should be a fun matchup. The Bears have been loading up this offseason to give Johnson the offense he needs, and the Lions will be breaking in a new defensive coordinator(in Kelvin Sheppard).”Now that the matchup is finally here, Detroit Lions head coach Dan Campbell says, “We are going to win this game. We have to.” And Chicago Bears head coach Ben Johnson responds, “We gotta turn the page quickly in Detroit.”Who’s going to win? We can’t wait to find out! For now, what else did the head coaches say? And—more importantly—what does NBC Sports’ Mike Florio think about this much-anticipated faceoff between two friends? Let’s read on.Talking to Nolan Bianchi of The Detroit News, Dan Campbell assured that he’s going to win against his friend’s team:“Ben(Johnson)’s my friend. He’s always going to be my friend. But nothing about that’s going to change.We’re going on, getting ready to play Chicago. We’re going to win this game. We have to.”After losing to the Minnesota Vikings in Week 1, Ben Johnson promised a quick turnaround in Detroit:“No one’s going to feel sorry for us. This is going to be a quick turnaround here to get going for Sunday in Detroit, our first road game. We gotta turn the page here quickly.”On September 14, Mike Florio of NBC Sports reported that it’s a big game for both head coaches.Ben Johnson’s Monday Night loss to the Minnesota Vikings, coupled with another loss against his former team, the Detroit Lions, would drop the Chicago Bears to 0-2. That would raise questions about whether Johnson is more suited for a coordinator’s role than a head coach.On the other hand, Dan Campbell entered the 2025 season with Super Bowl dreams, and a 0-2 start against divisional rivals would make the Detroit Lions the NFL’s most disappointing team through two weeks.","Detroit Lions head coach Dan Campbell says, “We are going to win this game.

Poll Do you think the handshake controversy affected the spirit of sportsmanship in the Asia Cup match? Yes, it significantly impacted sportsmanship. No, it was a minor issue. It depends on the context of the match.

The handshake row during the 2025 Asia Cup match between India and Pakistan took an ugly turn in Dubai.TimesofIndia.com has learnt that match referee Andy Pycroft instructed captain Salman Ali Agha to avoid shaking hands with Suryakumar Yadav at the toss, and the Pakistan team management has lodged a complaint against India for not showing sportsmanship.""The match referee Andy Pycroft had asked captain Salman Ali Agha, at the time of the toss, not to shake hands with his Indian counterpart. The Pakistan team management has lodged a protest, calling the behaviour against the spirit of sports,"" the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said in a statement.""Salman Ali Agha skipped the post-match presentation in protest against the behaviour of the Indian team, as the ceremony host was also an Indian.""Suryakumar Yadav dedicated Sunday’s emphatic seven-wicket win over Pakistan to the armed forces, expressing solidarity with the families of the victims of the Pahalgam terror attack as India outclassed their neighbours in a completely one-sided contest to underline their dominance in the Asia Cup clash.“Perfect occasion, taking the time out, we stand by the victims and families of the Pahalgam terror attack. We express our solidarity.I want to dedicate the win to all our armed forces who showed a lot of bravery. I hope they continue to inspire us all and we give them more reasons on the ground whenever we get an opportunity to put a smile on their face,” he said at the post-match presentation.Unusual scenes unfolded at the end of the match after Suryakumar sealed the win with a six, shook hands only with batting partner Shivam Dube, and walked off without acknowledging the Pakistani players.A similar moment occurred at the toss, when Suryakumar and Salman Ali Agha skipped the customary handshake. Even broadcaster Ravi Shastri, who conducted the toss, did not exchange pleasantries with Agha.At the post-match press conference, Suryakumar said: “I think that was our proper reply. Our government and the BCCI were aligned, and together we took a call. We came here only to play cricket.”He added: “I feel a few things in life are ahead of sportsmanship. I said at the presentation as well that we stand with all the victims of the Pahalgam terror attack. And we stand with their families too, expressing our solidarity.""Also, as I said at the post-match presentation, we dedicate this win to our brave armed forces who took part in Operation Sindoor. And as they continue to inspire us all, we will try our best, whenever given an opportunity, to inspire them as well, if possible.”Pakistan coach Mike Hesson confirmed Salman Ali Agha’s absence from the presentation was a reaction to India’s stance.“I think it's just the flow-on effect of the fact that we were obviously keen to engage and shake hands at the end of the match. That didn't happen. That was pretty much the end of it,” Hesson said.“Obviously, we were ready to shake hands at the end of the game. We were disappointed that our opposition didn't do that. We sort of went over there to shake hands and they were already going to the changing room. That was a disappointing way for the match to end. In a match where we were already disappointed with the way we played, we were at least willing to go and shake hands.”",India captain Suryakumar Yadav and Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha did not shake hands at the end of the Asia Cup match in Dubai.

No handshakes

India barely break sweat

A few days ago, R Ashwin cheekily suggested that South Africa be thrown into the Asia Cup mix and the event be rechristened the Afro-Asia Cup, just to inject some real competition. After Sunday, he may have had a point.On Sunday, under the sweltering Dubai heat, the so-called ""arch-rivalry"", once again, felt like a damp squib.The only real drama came when India captain Suryakumar Yadav refused the customary handshake at the toss with his counterpart Salman Ali Agha. Beyond that, Pakistan barely showed up, reduced to mere spectators in what was once cricket’s fiercest duel.After opting to bat first, Pakistan batters looked rattled against pace and were all at sea against India's quality spinners. Shaheen Afridi’s unbeaten 33 off 16 balls, laced with four sixes—including a brutal assault on Hardik Pandya in the final over — dragged Pakistan to 127/9. India won the match comprehensively by seven wickets.India, with Suryakumar Yadav and Shivam Dube in the middle, marched back to their dressing room the moment the game ended.The Indian pairing exchanged handshakes with teammates in the dugout, before the entire squad disappeared upstairs. The door shut firmly, echoing Suryakumar Yadav’s snub at the toss, as the Indian cricket team once again refused to shake hands with Pakistan.Caught in the middle, Salman Ali Agha’s men stopped mid-way after head coach Mike Hesson ordered them towards their dressing room. But not a single Indian player emerged. A visibly miffed Hesson then stormed to India’s dressing room, found no response, and was later spotted in a heated discussion with match referee Andy Pycroft.Later, SKY dedicated the win to the armed forces and expressed solidarity with the victims of the Pahalgam terror attack. ""We stand by the victims of the families of the Pahalgam terror attack. We express our solidarity. Want to dedicate the win to all our armed forces who showed a lot of bravery,"" he said in the post-match press conference.Hardik Pandya struck off the very first legal delivery of the match, sending Saim Ayub packing for his second golden duck in a row. Jasprit Bumrah then removed Pakistan’s recent hero Mohammad Haris, thanks to a sharp catch from Hardik Pandya.Thereafter, there was some spunk shown by Sahibzada Farhan (40 off 44; 1x4, 3x6), who has replaced Babar Azam in the team. He briefly resisted with a couple of sixes off Bumrah.The battle between Sahibzada Farhan and Jasprit Bumrah was fascinating. Pakistan's highest run-getter of the match tonked Bumrah over mid-on for a six.A ball later, there was a change in field. Shubman Gill walked to short mid-wicket from the only slip, and Bumrah tried an attempted yorker. The low full toss took Farhan by surprise and it nearly carried to Bumrah in the follow-through, but despite his full-stretched dive, it fell short.For the second match in a row, Bumrah bowled three overs on the trot in the powerplay. This time, Farhan dispatched him into the second tier. It was angling into the body, and the Pakistani opener swivelled his blade, got wood, and became only the sixth batter to hit multiple sixes off Bumrah in T20Is. To add to that, he also became the first Pakistan batter to hit a six off Bumrah's bowling in this format.Next ball, Farhan tried another maximum but ended up miscuing it and it fell in no man's land.Farhan added 39 runs while Fakhar Zaman, whose cameo ended at 17, was dismissed by Axar Patel.After that, India’s spinners tore through Pakistan’s middle order.Axar’s twin blows and Kuldeep’s double-strike ripped through Pakistan’s innings, choking their scoring despite desperate aggression. At one stage even 100 looked out of reach, before Shaheen’s late fireworks lifted them to something to fight with.Kuldeep Yadav (3/18) was once again India’s trump card, with Axar (2/18), Bumrah (2/28), Varun (1/24) and Pandya (1/34) ensuring Pakistan never settled.Abhishek Sharma started the chase in a way he always does. He made Shaheen Shah Afridi look like a club bowler—hitting a four and a six in the first two balls of the innings. He gave Shaheen the same treatment in his second spell, hammering him for a four and a maximum.Abhishek looked in a hurry, clattering Saim Ayub for back-to-back boundaries. With him at the crease, it looked like India would chase it down inside ten overs.But Saim Ayub, who is failing miserably with the bat, removed both Indian openers.Shubman Gill was deceived by a carrom ball. After being hit for two boundaries, Ayub bowled the ball of the match. The carrom ball dipped on off stump, Gill pressed forward but it turned away, beating the outside edge. Haris whipped off the bails in a flash. Saim then sent back Abhishek with a slower off-break, caught at long-off by Faheem Ashraf. Abhishek scored a quickfire 13-ball 31.Tilak Varma (31 off 31b; 2x4, 1x6) and Suryakumar Yadav (47 not out off 37 balls) put on a steady run-a-ball 56-run partnership for the third wicket to knock Pakistan out of the game.The duo looked at ease, rotated strike, hit a few audacious shots, and managed to keep Pakistan at bay.It was Saim Ayub who finally broke the partnership with another ripper. A quicker off-break on middle drifted in, pitched, and turned sharply. Tilak went back to defend but was beaten by the spin as the ball crashed into the off-stump. Saim Ayub had his third, while Tilak stood surprised at where it had pitched.Saim Ayub (3/35) was the pick of the Pakistan bowlers.Suryakumar Yadav sealed the match with a six, with 25 balls to spare, as India chased down the total comfortably.Overall, it was a nothing performance from Pakistan, and it looked like a mismatch competition both on paper and on the field.","India beat Pakistan by seven wickets in T20 match in Dubai.

Dominant India cruised to a seven-wicket win over arch-rivals Pakistan in their high-stakes Asia Cup 2025 Group A clash on Sunday at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium, but the result was overshadowed by off-field drama as Indian players skipped the customary post-match handshake.Chasing 128, skipper Suryakumar Yadav (47 not out off 37 balls) and Shivam Dube sealed the victory in 15.5 overs in Dubai.However, instead of greeting their opponents, the Indian pair walked straight to the dressing room after the winning six hit by Suryakumar. Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha and head coach Mike Hesson later approached the Indian camp, but no players came out to shake hands. Hesson appeared visibly annoyed by the snub.The India captain later spoke about his team's performance and how he felt scoring the winning runs on his birthday. Greeted by former India cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar, Suryakumar said, ""This is the perfect return gift to India.""He then made use of the winning moment to dedicate the win to India's armed forces. ""We stand by the victims of the families of Pahalgam terror attack. We express our solidarity. We want to dedicate today's win to all our Armed Forces who showed a lot of bravery.Hope they continue to inspire us all and we give them more reasons on the ground whenever we get an opportunity to make them smile,"" said the skipper. His comment was received with a roar of applause from the crowd.India's decision to not shake hands after the match on the other hand, was the second no-handshake episode of the day, after Suryakumar and Agha declined to exchange hands at the toss.The tension had already been stoked before the start, when organisers mistakenly played the wrong anthem for Pakistan, forcing an awkward pause before the correction.In the post-match press conference as well, Team India skipper answered questions about not shaking hands with the opposition. Posed with the same task of explaining his decision, he said. ""Few things in life are ahead of sportsman spirit also.""Team India and the players came under the microscope ahead of the Pakistan clash, given the charged atmosphere surrounding the match and amidst calls for boycotting the game. Speaking about handling the noise around such a game, the skipper said the squad had kept distractions away. “In my team, we decided to cut the outside noise. I don’t know what is happening on the social media,” he said.Pakistan head coach Mike Hesson was also straightforward in the way he answered questions about the handshake incident. ""We were ready to shake hands, disappointed opposition didn’t do that,” Hesson said after the game. He added that Pakistan were expecting to shake hands, but that India did not reciprocate.On the field, India’s spinners dominated. Kuldeep Yadav (3/18) and Axar Patel (2/18) choked Pakistan’s middle order after Hardik Pandya and Jasprit Bumrah struck early blows.Only Sahibzada Farhan (40 off 44) and Shaheen Afridi (33* off 16) offered resistance, taking Pakistan to 127/9.In reply, India made short work of the chase. Abhishek Sharma blazed 31 off 13 balls, Tilak Varma steadied with 31 off 31, and Suryakumar finished things off with trademark composure.Both sides came into the clash on the back of convincing wins, India crushing UAE and Pakistan thrashing Oman. But the simmering political tensions between the neighbours spilled onto the field, with the absence of handshakes adding another layer to the rivalry.India now top Group A, while Pakistan are left with question marks both on and off the field after another of the fancied rivalry went the Men in Blue's way.",India beat Pakistan by seven wickets in their Asia Cup 2025 Group A clash.

Jordon Hudson turns heads on UNC sidelines



Bill Belichick finds rhythm with North Carolina football



The North Carolina Tar Heels steamrolled Richmond 41-6 for their first home victory of the season, and Jordon Hudson, with her trademark charm and style, lit up the sidelines next to her boyfriend, head coach Bill Belichick. The win marked Belichick’s first collegiate home triumph since leaving the NFL, making the day one to remember for both football and fashion.Hudson, 24, has been a constant presence throughout Belichick’s transition from his legendary NFL run to college coaching. On Saturday, she once again drew eyes with her outfit—a black hooded sweatshirt paired with a bold “Blind For Love” sweater featuring a tiger face, identical to the one Taylor Swift wore in her “Look What You Made Me Do” video. Whether a quiet nod to Swift or just a fashion choice, the sweater sparked plenty of chatter.Hudson didn’t just show up for style points. She mingled with fans, exchanged smiles on the sideline, and even carried a clear purse with visible legal papers inside—highlighted sections on “false light” and “fraud” that intrigued eagle-eyed observers. This isn’t the first time she has been spotted with documents at games, fueling speculation that she might be sending subtle messages, much like Swift herself is known to do.Her growing presence has turned her into something of a local celebrity in Chapel Hill. She was seen earlier in the week taking selfies with supporters, and despite reminders from UNC that she holds no official role with the program, Hudson continues to act as Belichick’s de facto publicist and closest supporter.For Belichick, Saturday’s dominant win carried personal significance. His college debut against TCU ended in a painful 48-14 blowout, but the Tar Heels have now improved to 2-1 under his leadership. At 73, the former Patriots coach is seeking to build a new legacy in the college ranks after parting ways with New England following a disappointing 4-13 season.Still, not all news has been positive. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office recently rejected several applications filed by Belichick’s TCE Rights Management LLC, managed by Hudson. Phrases like “Do Your Job (Bill’s Version)” and “No Days Off (Bill’s Version)” were blocked due to similarities with existing Patriots trademarks.Yet optimism lingers. With Hudson’s unwavering support and a promising young team, Belichick’s new chapter in Chapel Hill is only beginning.Also Read: Eagles escape with narrow 20-17 win over Chiefs after Travis Kelce’s late blunder costs Kansas City dearly","Jordon Hudson, boyfriend of North Carolina head coach Bill Belichick, was on the sidelines on Saturday.

NFL’s tribute to a national figure sparks mixed reactions

A mix of acknowledgments and silence across the league



The NFL paid tribute to conservative commentator Charlie Kirk following his untimely death, as several teams observed a moment of silence ahead of their Week 2 games. The gesture came after Kirk, 31, was tragically shot and killed during a speaking event in Utah on September 10, 2025. The league’s decision to hold the tribute during the Packers-Commanders matchup was particularly notable, with Commissioner Roger Goodell present in the stadium.An NFL spokesperson, Brian McCarthy, commented, “There have been a variety of moments of silence and tributes in-stadium and on-air in all games or a game immediately following events that rise to a national level.” He emphasized that the league left it up to home teams to decide whether to hold a tribute, leading to varied responses across the league.Teams like the Tennessee Titans displayed Kirk’s image alongside his family on the jumbotron as part of their tribute. The Miami Dolphins combined a moment of silence for Kirk with remembrance of the victims of the 9/11 terrorist attacks and “any other victims of violence,” while offering “a prayer for unity in our country.”Other teams, such as the New York Jets, Dallas Cowboys, and New Orleans Saints, also held moments of silence.The Arizona Cardinals followed suit in their own way. Meanwhile, some clubs, including the Baltimore Ravens, Detroit Lions, and Indianapolis Colts, chose not to hold a specific moment of silence for Kirk during the early or late game windows.Also Read: Jalen Hurts, Josh Allen, Travis Kelce or Aaron Rodgers did not donate $300K to Charlie Kirk’s family, fact check reveals This decision reflects the league’s open approach, allowing teams to determine their own responses to national tragedies.

Eagles outlast Chiefs in another tight rematch



Rivalry grows with every chapter



In a highly anticipated Week 2 clash, the Kansas City Chiefs hosted the Philadelphia Eagles in what felt like déjà vu for football fans. Just seven months after their Super Bowl LIX showdown, the two heavyweights collided at Arrowhead Stadium, renewing a rivalry that has quickly become one of the NFL’s most fascinating storylines. The Eagles walked away with another victory, edging the Chiefs 20-17 in a nail-biting contest that came down to the final drive.The Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles meet again, and once more, Philadelphia found the winning formula. Jalen Hurts led his side with poise, while Patrick Mahomes fought until the very end. The turning point came when Travis Kelce mishandled a routine catch, leading to an interception by safety Andrew Mukuba. That turnover set up a Hurts touchdown, ultimately deciding the game.Unlike the Eagles’ dominant 40-22 win in February, this encounter was far more balanced. Saquon Barkley opened the scoring with a 13-yard run, a fitting redemption after a quiet Super Bowl performance. Mahomes responded with his own touchdown run, showing the fight that has defined his career. The first half ended with traded field goals, leaving fans bracing for a tense second act.That tension only grew in the fourth quarter. Down 20-10, Mahomes launched a spectacular 49-yard pass to Tyquan Thornton, sparking hope in Kansas City. Yet, the Eagles displayed composure, sealing the game with Hurts’ signature quarterback sneak and consuming the remaining minutes.This rivalry is carving out a unique place in NFL history. It marked the 11th Super Bowl rematch in the following season and the third straight year fans were treated to such a showdown, according to ESPN Research. Remarkably, it was also the fifth meeting between these two franchises in five seasons, the first time since the 1970 merger that non-conference opponents have clashed this often.The Chiefs are now staring at an unfamiliar 0-2 start, something they have not endured since 2014, the last season they missed the playoffs. Meanwhile, the Eagles are flying high at 2-0, further asserting themselves as one of the league’s most consistent contenders.

Why Taylor Swift’s discreet entrance is making headlines

The connection between her concert strategy and game appearance

Taylor Swift showed up in true superstar style at the Kansas City Chiefs’ home opener, but this time, she kept it subtle. Rather than arriving front and center in a highly publicized fashion, the pop icon slipped into GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium in a rather discreet manner, leaving fans buzzing.While Taylor Swift is no stranger to grand entrances—famously arriving in cleaning carts during her Eras Tour—her decision to blend into the background at the Chiefs game raised eyebrows. Fans quickly noticed something was off as Swift avoided the usual red carpet spectacle and instead entered behind a screen. Social media quickly erupted with speculation and excitement.One fan posted on X, “Another video of taylor arriving behind a screen, you can see andrea in this one!” Another chimed in, “Okay that’s def Taylor and something is def going on wtf,” while yet another added, “I think I see taylor’s head on the ceiling reflection.” These posts reflect the excitement and curiosity of Swift’s dedicated fan base, always eager to analyze every detail.What makes this story even more fascinating is the parallel to Swift’s well-known tour entrances.

Leverage penalty explained: How a rare NFL rule became the deciding factor in Broncos vs Colts clash,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/leverage-penalty-explained-how-a-rare-nfl-rule-became-the-deciding-factor-in-broncos-vs-colts-clash/articleshow/123889695.cms,"What is a leverage penalty? (USA Today Sports)

Why a leverage penalty was called in Broncos vs Colts



How the penalty flipped the game’s outcome



The Denver Broncos vs the Indianapolis Colts clash turned dramatic in the final seconds, ending in a 29-28 Colts victory. Kicker Spencer Schrader drilled a 45-yard field goal as time expired, but only after a leverage penalty gave Indianapolis a second chance. Denver thought it had sealed the win when Schrader missed a 60-yarder, yet the yellow flag changed everything.A leverage penalty in the NFL occurs when a defender uses a teammate or opponent’s body to gain extra height while attempting to block a kick. The league considers it unsafe and unfair, and the penalty carries 15 yards along with an automatic first down if committed during a field goal try.On Sunday, officials ruled that Broncos linebacker Deondrea Tillman made illegal contact with Colts long snapper Luke Rhodes during Schrader’s 60-yard attempt. The flag wiped away Denver’s celebration and set up the game-winning 45-yard retry.“I gotta go back and watch the film and see what I can learn from it,” Tillman admitted postgame. “I was just playing free and trying to go for the ball.”The penalty stunned the Broncos, who moments earlier had been poised to start 2-0. Instead, they walked off in disbelief while the Colts improved to 2-0 under Daniel Jones.Before the dramatic finish, Colts coach Shane Steichen’s late-game clock management was already under scrutiny.With Jonathan Taylor losing two yards on a critical run, Indianapolis faced a daunting 60-yard field goal attempt. Schrader’s miss seemed to seal Denver’s win until the leverage call gave the Colts new life.Shrader redeemed himself by splitting the uprights from 45 yards, handing Indianapolis a stunning win. Broncos head coach Sean Payton reflected on the collapse: “We had a number of opportunities to not be in that position late. Unfortunately, we shot ourselves in the foot too many times.”The ruling has sparked debate among fans and analysts about whether the officials made the right call in such a decisive moment. Some argue it was technically correct by the rulebook, while others believe it was too light a call to swing the outcome of a tightly contested game.For now, the Colts march on unbeaten, while the Broncos are left replaying a painful lesson in how one penalty can change everything.Also Read: Shedeur Sanders avoids straight answer on Ravens draft rumors following Browns’ embarrassing loss to division rivals",The Denver Broncos lost 29-28 to the Indianapolis Colts in the NFL on Sunday.

Simone Biles shows unwavering support for Jonathan Owens with custom gameday outfit

Former NFL star Antonio Brown ignited backlash online after making a crude remark about Olympic gymnast Simone Biles and her husband, Chicago Bears safety Jonathan Owens.

His comment regarding Biles and Owens read: ""Those handj**s gotta be wild."" Since leaving the NFL in January 2022, Brown has frequently used social media to make polarizing statements, often drawing widespread criticism from fans and analysts alike.Biles, who married Owens in 2023, shared a heartfelt moment on the sidelines before the game, embracing and kissing her husband. She also showcased her dedication with a custom gameday look, featuring black pants embroidered with “Jonathan” and “Owens,” a black tank top, and a football-shaped handbag complete with the NFL logo. Owens, in turn, has consistently supported Biles at gymnastics events, highlighting a reciprocal display of encouragement in their relationship.The Bears’ Week 1 loss to the Minnesota Vikings saw Owens contributing mostly on special teams, recording only two tackles.Despite this, Biles continues to make public appearances in support of her husband, reinforcing the couple’s strong bond.Also Read: “Put people to shame”: Taylor Swift's relationship with Travis Kelce is impacting his unique fashion sense While Brown’s remarks have generated heated discussions online, the spotlight remains on the mutual respect and admiration between Biles and Owens—an example of a high-profile sports couple openly celebrating each other’s achievements.","Former NFL star Antonio Brown made a crude remark about Olympic gymnast Simone Biles and her husband, Chicago Bears safety Jonathan Owens.

Pittsburgh Steelers veteran quarterback Aaron Rodgers ’ former partners—Shailene Woodley, Olivia Munn , and Danica Patrick—have shared powerful excerpts from their past relationships, including phrases like “Depression would come,” “Dangerous to my psyche,” and “Emotionally abusive. ” Thanks to the podcast world, women have started expressing themselves beyond the fear of judgment. Let’s gauge through the emotions each of these women went through when they were in a relationship with the Ayahuasca Retreat lover, Aaron Rodgers.Shailene Woodley described her relationship with former Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers in an interview with Melissa Johnson ofMagazine.actress said she had lost herself completely. She said she understood what anxiety and depression truly were. Her stylist, Kris Zero, would try her level best to keep theactress occupied, but she would feel depressed again.“I haven’t shared much about my relationship with Aaron(Rodgers) because it always makes me cry. It was not right. But it was beautiful. I had a really awful, traumatic thing happen in early 2022.I felt like I lost my soul, my self, my happiness, my joy. I really understood depression and anxiety, and like, complete soul detachment.”She chose to remain in a toxic situation because she was empathizing with someone else.“Empathy kind of kept me in this loop of feeling everything for everyone. I knew I was depressed when I looked at a tree and felt nothing. That was the lowest low of my life.”Shailene Woodley’s stylist, Kris Zero, would wake her up with blasting music just to get her out of bed. “Sometimes I was so angry at her. But then we’d go surf, and for ten minutes that day, I thought life could be okay again.Then the depression would come back, and she’d out–We’re volunteering at the horse ranch! – and we’d find a random f*cking horse ranch and we’d clean up horse sh*t.We’d clean hooves and brush the horses, and for 20 minutes that day, I thought like could be okay again. And then depression came back, and she’d wake up the next morning and go–Let’s go on a hike and bring trash bags and clean up trash!”Melissa reported that after about six months, the depression started to fade.Olivia Munn, theactress, appeared on thepodcast, where she talked about a past relationship in which she felt trapped in a tumultuous family dynamic. She said that her therapist encouraged her to stay in the relationship that she wanted to get out of.“I had a therapist who I really loved, and I know that she cared about me, or at least I thought she did. I would constantly, from the very beginning, say–I don’t know about this, I don’t think this is the right(relationship), I want to get out. I gotta get out,” Munn said.Theactress said her therapist encouraged her to stay in that relationship. “She thought that my ‘picker’ was off, and she would look at it as: this person on paper looked great. And when there was couples therapy, they knew how to present the right way. Then the stories I would tell seemed unbelievable.From that experience, learning that I gotta go with my gut and I gotta be decisive with some things if it’s coming from a place where I want to survive, and I realize that I’m not happy, and that days and weeks and months go by of unhappiness and fear.I don’t know if there’s a word to describe what that relationship was like. It was without a doubt the hardest period of my life, being in that,” she said she felt “really trapped in a tumultuous family dynamic.”Munn further said that the relationship taught her to stand up for herself. “It taught me how to stand up and fight for myself, so that was great. I truly had no idea that I could be manipulated and hurt that way, that I wouldn’t just get out of something that was dangerous to my psyche.It’s not just the period that you’re with the person, but, if you’re lucky to get out, (it’s) the years of healing yourself afterwards,” Munn told Lewinsky.She further shared, “The catalyst was getting out of a relationship that had drained me and left me just really...it's hard, I don't know if there's a word to describe it what that relationship was like...it was, without a doubt, the hardest period of my life, being in that.”Danica Patrick, the former professional racing driver and model, appeared onpodcast, where she disclosed that she was in an emotionally abusive relationship with the 41-year-old quarterback, Aaron Rodgers.“The breakup with Aaron(Rodgers) in 2020—because it was sudden, it felt like it was my life. When you live with somebody, it’s your whole life—your dentist appointments, your hairdo, your clothes, your mailing address, everything. Because the nature of the relationship was emotionally abusive, it wore me down to nothing.Something that people could never imagine is that I would lack any confidence or belief in the simple things about who I am. Everything was torn to bits.He leaves a trail of blood. I don’t think I’m saying too much earth-shattering stuff; there’s been enough out there.But it gave me the greatest gift, which was myself—how much I needed to show up for myself, take care of myself,” Patrick told Sage Steele.The former IndyCar Series and NASCAR driver said she felt like she was built for hard things when she was in a relationship with Rodgers,“Hindsight, I ignored it(emotionally abusive relationship), but in real life, it was just like, I would say all the time—I’m built for hard things. I can handle hard things. And so, I just saw it as a hard thing, and my nature is to try harder and do more.What if I don't do it for the right person? What if I get too proud and go like—I'm just I'm done. Instead of going—Man, just try a little harder. What if you look back and think—Man, I wish I would have tried. I would never want that in my life. I wish I would have tried. This is probably why I don't have regret and I don't have shame.”","Aaron Rodgers’ former partners have shared powerful excerpts from their past relationships, including phrases like “Depression would come,” “Dangerous to my psyche,’ and “Emotionally abusive.” Thanks to the podcast world, women have started expressing themselves beyond the fear of judgment.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123764899,imgsize-3192143,width-400,resizemode-4/nfl-aaron-rodgers.jpg"

Magic Johnson recalls costly rookie mistake with Converse over Nike

Michael Jordan Vs LeBron James GOAT debate continues. Image via: Getty Images

When Los Angeles Lakers legend Magic Johnson reflects on his rookie years, two names dominate the conversation: Larry Bird and Michael Jordan. Both rivals helped define his era, yet Johnson now admits his own missteps, particularly when business decisions off the court and on-court rivalries shaped his career. Speaking candidly, Johnson revealed he underestimated Jordan’s rise while focusing on Bird, and also passed up on a shoe deal that could have changed his financial legacy forever.Magic Johnson’s rivalry with Larry Bird began before either entered the NBA, with their iconic 1979 NCAA title clash. By the time the Lakers selected him first overall, shoe companies lined up with offers. Johnson chose Converse for its cash-heavy deal, a decision he now views as shortsighted.“Converse offered me the most money. And so, when you’re Black and you’re broke, you take the most money, right? So I decided to go with Converse,” Johnson said on the Earn Your Leisure podcast.The NBA Hall of Famer added, “But Phil Knight came in and said, ‘I can’t offer you the same amount of money as Converse, but I can give you something called stock.’ And I passed on the stock, not knowing anything about it at 19. You know how much that stock would be worth today, 46 years later? A billion-five.”That choice cost him the chance to mirror what Jordan later achieved with Nike. In 1984, the Chicago Bulls guard signed an unprecedented five-year, $2.5 million contract that included a 5% royalty on sales. The Air Jordan line didn’t just make Jordan wealthy; it reshaped the entire sneaker industry.Beyond endorsements, Johnson is also clear-eyed about Jordan’s dominance as a player. The two met in the 1991 NBA Finals, where Jordan’s Bulls toppled the Lakers and signaled a new era. One play in particular, Jordan’s mid-air hand switch, still lingers in Johnson’s memory.“I’m always going to be honest with myself. The only thing I beat Michael in is them no-look passes and leadership,” Johnson admitted. “Ain’t no question. Just like it ain’t no question what he’s going to do to me. Dunks and all that, but that’s what makes him a bad boy. The best that’s ever done it.”Johnson still praises LeBron James, calling him a “bad boy” in his own right, but he makes it clear Jordan stands apart. “Don’t get it twisted; I love LeBron, but when Michael Jordan took off with that tongue out? Man. Listen, a lot of you weren’t born then. 1991, against my Lakers, right hand, we thought we had him. Then he looked at us mid-air, switched it to the left. Tongue out. Glass. Bucket. Nobody alive has been able to do that. ”Also Read: Breanna Stewart injury update: New York Liberty star exits game 1 against Phoenix Mercury after apparent left knee trouble The James-Jordan debate is never-ending, and it will continue as both legends created stunning legacies for themselves with their brilliant run in the NBA.","Magic Johnson says he underestimated Michael Jordan’s rise while focusing on Larry Bird.

Kurt Benkert points to missed penalties

Eagles’ win overshadowed by controversy

Tush Push debate heats up again

The Philadelphia Eagles may have edged out the Kansas City Chiefs 20-17 in a tense clash, but their victory was quickly overshadowed by a storm around their trademark “Tush Push.” The short-yardage play, used late in the game near the end zone, appeared to involve multiple false starts and neutral zone violations. No penalty was called, sparking outrage among fans—and a sharp rebuke from former Packers quarterback Kurt Benkert, who declared the sequence “not real football.”Benkert, who has built a strong following with his candid takes on social media, dissected the play in slow motion and highlighted what he viewed as three separate penalties overlooked by officials. “I had the Eagles winning today, but it doesn’t change the fact that this is a penalty and still not real football,” Benkert wrote on X, voicing the frustration of those who felt the refs looked the other way.Unlike armchair analysts, Benkert’s critique carries the weight of experience. Having played quarterback in the NFL, his perspective goes beyond fan outrage and speaks to the heart of the rulebook. By calling out the Tush Push as a distortion of the sport, he tapped into a broader unease: whether the league’s most polarizing play is skillful innovation or an unfair loophole.The win over the Chiefs should have been a statement moment for Philadelphia, yet the controversy cast a shadow over the result.The Eagles used the Tush Push as their trusted weapon once again, reminding opponents of its near-automatic success rate. For critics, though, the no-call on Sunday only deepens the case that the play undermines football’s competitive balance in the eyes of many.Benkert’s blunt assessment highlights a growing divide across the league. To some, the Tush Push is tactical brilliance; to others, it is rugby dressed up as football. Sunday’s missed flags have amplified the debate, turning a tight 20-17 Eagles win into a larger talking point about officiating consistency and the future of one of the NFL’s most controversial plays.Also read: Will Puka Nacua play tonight against the Titans?

India-Pakistan Asia Cup Match Triggers Political Storm, Opposition Slams PM Modi, BJP

NEW DELHI: India handed Pakistan a crushing seven-wicket defeat in their Asia Cup 2025 Group A encounter at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Sunday, but the drama off the field quickly overshadowed the on-field performance. Following a clinical bowling effort that restricted Pakistan to 127/9, Team India chased the target in just 15.5 overs, losing three wickets. Yet it was their post-match actions that caught global attention.After the final ball, while Pakistan waited for the customary handshake, none of the Indian players were on the field. Footage also showed India’s support staff closing the team dressing room door, leaving Pakistan players stranded. Former Pakistan pacer Shoaib Akhtar expressed his disappointment on a post-match show, calling the incident disheartening.“I’m speechless. It is disheartening to see and I don’t know what to say. Hats off to India. Just don’t make things political. Cricket match hain, isko political mat banao… Fights happen, even inside your house. Forget it, move on. It is the game of cricket, shake your hands, show your grace,” Akhtar said.The former speedster also backed Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha’s decision to skip the post-match presentation ceremony.“Thik kiya Salman Ali Agha ne, wo nahi gaya post match mein, good,” he added.Sunday’s clash marked the first cricketing meeting between India and Pakistan since geopolitical tensions escalated earlier this year after the Pahalgam terror attack. Ahead of the match, there were calls across social media and within India for the team to boycott the fixture, but tournament regulations made forfeiture impossible. India, however, maintained a stance aligned with national sentiment.While the match itself was a one-sided affair, it was the handshake controversy and Akhtar’s dramatic comments that dominated post-match conversations, reminding cricket fans worldwide that this rivalry, both on and off the field, carries significance far beyond runs and wickets.","India handed Pakistan a crushing seven-wicket defeat in their Asia Cup 2025 Group A encounter.

NEW DELHI: India all-rounder Hardik Pandya etched his name into the record books by claiming a wicket with his very first delivery in the Asia Cup Group A clash against arch-rivals Pakistan on Sunday. He became only the second Indian bowler to achieve the feat in T20Is.The landmark moment came in the opening over of the match. After starting with a wide down the leg side, Pandya adjusted his line and struck immediately with the next ball. Pakistan opener Saim Ayub, looking to punch the outswinger through the off side, could only find Jasprit Bumrah at point. The opener departed without scoring a single run.With this, Pandya joined fellow pacer Arshdeep Singh in a rare club. Arshdeep was the first Indian to claim a wicket off his first legitimate ball in a T20I, dismissing USA’s Shayan Jahangir in New York during the 2024 T20 World Cup.

Bob Goodenow dies at 72: The man behind NHL’s toughest labor battles

Remembering Bob Goodenow’s legacy in NHL and beyond



NHL insider Frank Seravalli has confirmed the sudden passing of Bob Goodenow, the former Executive Director of the NHL Players’ Association, at the age of 72. Widely regarded as one of hockey’s most influential labor leaders, Goodenow guided players through some of the league’s most turbulent chapters. His leadership not only reshaped the NHL’s labor landscape but also expanded the game’s global footprint.Goodenow assumed leadership of the NHLPA in 1992 and wasted little time in making his mark. Within months, he orchestrated a players’ strike that showcased his determination to protect athletes’ rights. Over the next decade, his leadership was tested by two defining labor disputes.The 1994-95 lockout shortened the NHL season to 48 games, while the 2004-05 standoff resulted in the unprecedented cancellation of an entire season.

Breanna Stewart leaves overtime with left knee injury

New York Liberty eye Game 2 with uncertainty around Breanna Stewart



The New York Liberty stole Game 1 of their playoff series with the Phoenix Mercury, winning 76-69 in overtime on Sunday night. But the celebration came with a dark cloud. Star forward Breanna Stewart left the game late in overtime clutching her left knee, leaving her team and fans holding their breath ahead of a decisive Game 2 in New York.With just over three minutes left in the extra period, Stewart scored a tough and-1 layup over Satou Sabally, but the contact left her writhing on the floor in pain. She stayed in to attempt the free throw, which she missed, and tried to play on.Barely a minute later, she asked out of the game and did not return. Stewart finished with 18 points, six rebounds, four assists, and two steals before being replaced by Kennedy Burke.The two-time MVP was spotted wearing a brace on her left knee while sitting on the bench. Liberty head coach Sandy Brondello offered little clarity postgame. “No, no, we only just got back to the locker room,” she said when asked for an update. “I’m sure she’ll be evaluated soon. She asked me to sub her out there, and she looked uncomfortable, so that was the reason we took her out there. And then we’re just, you know, we’ll just be hoping that she’ll be OK.The injury is especially concerning given Stewart’s history this season. She already missed 13 games over the summer with a bone bruise in her right knee, the opposite leg.Stewart’s absence would be a massive blow for the Liberty, who leaned heavily on her late-game poise. Her midrange jumper tied Game 1 at 65 with just over a minute left in regulation, setting the stage for overtime. New York ultimately pulled away behind Natasha Cloud’s 23 points and Jonquel Jones’ interior presence, but Stewart’s injury overshadowed the victory.The Liberty have battled injuries all year, with Sabrina Ionescu and Jones also missing stretches. They signed former Finals MVP Emma Meesseman in August to bolster their depth, and she may be thrust into a larger role if Stewart is sidelined.Also Read: Atlanta Dream’s Naz Hillmon exposes major weakness of playoff opponent after taking 1-0 playoff lead over Indiana Fever Game 2 tips off Wednesday at Barclays Center, where the Liberty will try to advance without knowing if their superstar will be ready to suit up.","Breanna Stewart left game late in overtime with left knee injury.
