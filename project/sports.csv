Thackerays lose control of BMC: What's next for Uddhav and his Sena,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/thackerays-lose-control-of-bmc-whats-next-for-uddhav-and-his-sena/articleshow/126584774.cms,"Mumbai And Pune Verdict Shake Thackeray And Pawar Dynasties As Legacy Politics Faces Reality Check

NEW DELHI: The last bastion of the Thackerays has been breached. The BJP-led Mahayuti has ended the decades-old dominance of the Thackerays in the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). Even the “Brhamastra” of reunion, of cousins Uddhav and Raj. failed to help them retain control of the cash-rich civic body.For Uddhav Thackeray , this was a do-or-die electoral battle. After losing his government, his party, his symbol, it was important for Uddhav not to lose control over the BMC. While Uddhav’s Shiv Sena UBT did put up a strong fight, in the end it was not enough. On the other hand, Raj Thackeray ’s MNS, which has failed to make any significant electoral impact in the state since it was formed, failed yet again. As the results show, there were few takers for Raj Thackeray’s extreme anti-Marathi aggression.So, where do the Thackerays go from here? Will the Thackeray cousins continue with their alliance for future elections in the state? Or will Uddhav chart his own path once again?After the assembly elections in 2019, Uddhav had parted ways with his long-time ally - the BJP and joined hands with Sharad Pawar’s NCP and the Congress to form the MVA government in the state. However, his government could last only for around two and a half years. A revolt in the party by Eknath Shinde saw Uddhav lose his government, party and even the bow and arrow symbol.Uddhav’s decision to join hands with the Congress was a bold political decision given his father Bal Thackeray’s very strong views against the grand-old party. The BJP and the Shinde Sena have used Uddhav’s Congress association to not just corner him but also question his Hindutva commitment.Ahead of the BMC elections , Uddhav once again changed tracks - this time choosing his estranged cousin Raj Thackeray over the Congress for the make or break civic polls. The much-hyped reunion of the cousins became the talking point during the civic elections. Together they raised the Marathi Manoos pitch with aggression. However, in the end it was not enough to secure them a victory.What is also a worry for Uddhav Thackeray is the encouraging performance of Shinde’s Shiv Sena. Eknath Shinde has made impressive gains since he broke ranks with Uddhav. He has proved, election after election, that his Shiv Sena has wider acceptance in Maharashtra compared to the Uddhav Sena. With the BJP firmly behind him as of now, Shinde is the biggest threat to Uddhav’s party and his future politics.Uddhav Thackeray has not only lost electoral battles but also the perception battle of being the real Shiv Sena. He desperately needs to reclaim the political space in Maharashtra which he has lost to Shinde Sena in the last few years.While Uddhav’s party had made it clear that it will return to MVA fold for the assembly elections, it will be interesting to see the future course of action that Uddhav and his MVA allies actually take.The Congress has made it clear that it will not be part of any coalition that has Raj Thackeray, given the hard anti-outsider stand of the MNS chief. The Congress, which contested the civic polls without its MVA allies, would be hopeful, if not happy, with the results. It is unlikely that the grand-old party will change its stand vis-a-vis Raj Thackeray. Which means that Uddhav will have to decide between the Congress and the MNS.","The BJP-led Mahayuti has ended the decades-old dominance of the Thackerays in the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation.

Actin ‘waves’ help T cells reuse key receptors: IISc study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/actin-waves-help-t-cells-reuse-key-receptors-iisc-study/articleshow/126581874.cms,"BENGALURU: A new study from the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) has uncovered how dynamic movements of actin, a structural protein inside cells, help T cells sustain immune responses by preserving critical surface receptors during early contact with infected cells.T cells are central to adaptive immunity, the arm of the immune system that recognises and eliminates specific pathogens. As per the study, when a naive T cell encounters an antigen-presenting cell (APC), it forms a specialised contact zone called the immunological synapse. Events in the first few minutes of this interaction determine how the T cell will respond.Previous studies had shown that antigen-bound T cell receptors (TCRs) cluster at the synapse and move towards its centre, driven by the backward flow of actin filaments. This inward movement was thought to prepare the receptors for endocytosis, allowing the T cell to disengage from the APC.However, this posed a puzzle: T cells are known to interact with multiple APCs in succession, something that would be difficult if most receptors were internalised and had to be newly produced each time.To investigate this, a team led by Sudha Kumari from the Department of Microbiology and Cell Biology, working with Sumantra Sarkar’s group from the Department of Physics, used high spatial and temporal resolution imaging to track TCR movement during contact with an APC-like surface.They also developed a tracking algorithm to analyse the trajectories of individual receptor clusters.The results, published in the journal “EMBO Reports”, showed that nearly 40% of TCR microclusters moved away from the centre of the immunological synapse towards the cell periphery, a behaviour that could not be explained by actin’s conventional inward flow alone.The researchers found that actin was forming outward-propagating wavefronts around the synapse centre. These waves were tightly coupled to the outward motion of TCR microclusters, effectively rescuing them from endocytosis.Experiments with naive T cells lacking the protein WASP, which is associated with immunodeficiency disorders, showed a breakdown in this coupling, underlining the role of actin dynamics in the process, IISc said.“It’s like saying the river flows both ways,” Kumari said, referring to the paradoxical observation of actin-driven transport in opposing directions.The findings highlight a previously underappreciated layer of control at the immune synapse. According to first author Aheria Dey, a PhD student at IISc, this contact site is the T cell’s “decision-making point”, and small changes in cytoskeletal behaviour could influence whether immune responses are effective or faulty.The work also raises broader questions in biophysics about how active cellular materials generate complex patterns, with potential implications for understanding immune disorders, cancer immunotherapy, and autoimmune diseases.","A new study from the Indian Institute of Science has uncovered how dynamic movements of actin, a structural protein inside cells, help T cells sustain immune responses.

BJP leader K Annamalai hit back at MNS chief Raj Thackeray, daring him to stop his entry into Mumbai, a day after Thackeray mocked him as “rasmalai” and questioned his right to comment on the city.“Who are Aaditya Thackeray and Raj Thackeray to threaten me?

I don’t know whether I have become that important,” Annamalai said.“Some have written that they will cut my legs if I come to Mumbai. I will come to Mumbai—try cutting my legs. If I were afraid of such threats, I would have stayed in my village. If I say Kamaraj is one of India’s greatest leaders, does it mean he is no longer a Tamil?

Thalapathy Vijay’s Jana Nayagan Gets Morning Relief, Evening Setback — Next Hearing Jan 21

NEW DELHI: In a big setback to actor Vijay, the Supreme Court on Thursday refused to entertain a plea against an order of stay passed by a division bench of the Madras high court over the certification of his movie ""Jana Nayagan"".The top court asked KVN production to raise its grievances before a division bench of the Madras HC, which is examining the issue.A bench of Justices Deepankar Datta and AG Masih asked the Madras high court to decide the matter by January 20.On January 9, the Madras high court stayed a single judge’s order directing the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) to immediately grant a censor certificate to Jana Nayagan, leaving the fate of actor-turned-politician Vijay’s film uncertain.KVN Productions LLP moved an appeal against the single judge’s directive, after a division bench of the high court last Friday put the order on hold and restrained the CBFC from issuing the certificate.Vijay recently launched his political party, the Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam.“Jana Nayagan”, widely projected as Vijay’s final film before his full-time entry into politics, was scheduled for a Pongal release on January 9.However, the release hit last-minute hurdles after the CBFC failed to issue certification in time.The division bench’s order came hours after Justice P T Asha directed the CBFC to clear “Jana Nayagan”, setting aside the film board’s decision to refer the matter to a review committee.Subsequently, the first bench comprising Chief Justice M M Shrivastava and Justice G Arul Murugan, acting on an appeal filed by the CBFC, granted an interim stay on the single judge’s verdict.Earlier, while allowing KVN Productions’ plea seeking a direction to the CBFC to issue the censor certificate, Justice Asha held that once the board had decided to grant certification, the chairperson had no authority to refer the film to a review committee.The film board immediately challenged the order before the division bench.","The top court asked KVN production to raise its grievances before a division bench of the Madras HC, which is examining the issue.

Tom Brady reveals the one factor that could trouble Matthew Stafford in Chicago,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/tom-brady-reveals-the-one-factor-that-could-trouble-matthew-stafford-in-chicago/articleshow/126600446.cms,"Tom Brady reveals the one factor that could trouble Matthew Stafford in Chicago (Getty Images)

Tom Brady on Matthew Stafford’s cold-weather adjustment

The Los Angeles Rams walk into one of the toughest environments in the NFL this weekend, and the spotlight once again lands on quarterback Matthew Stafford . The Rams face the Chicago Bears on January 18, 2026, at Soldier Field, where winter conditions often shape the outcome as much as play-calling.This time, the conversation took a sharper turn after Tom Brady weighed in. The seven-time Super Bowl champion offered perspective on cold-weather football while speaking about Stafford’s situation, not as criticism but as a reminder of how quickly conditions can test even proven quarterbacks.Brady shared his thoughts during an appearance on ""The Herd with Colin Cowherd"" earlier this month. While discussing playoff football and QB preparation, Brady pointed to weather as a subtle but real factor in Chicago’s favor.“Matt did play in Detroit for a long time, and in that division he went outside to Chicago and Green Bay,” Brady said on the FOX Sports show. “It’s not like he hasn’t played in it. But I will say, when I went to Tampa after my time in New England, it didn’t take me very long to get very soft in the cold.”TB-12's comment came with context, no doubt. Stafford spent 12 seasons with the Detroit Lions and played many games in the freezing conditions of the NFC North.But since joining the Rams in 2021, most of his winters in Southern California have been mild. Chicago expects temperatures near 10 degrees on Sunday, with wind gusts close to 20 miles per hour. Wind chill could push the “feels like” temperature closer to four degrees by kickoff.Brady explained how quickly the body reacts when cold exposure becomes rare. He recalled Tampa Bay’s NFC Championship Game trip to Green Bay during the 2020 season.“That game was around 32 to 34 degrees at kickoff,” Brady said during the interview. “It wasn’t minus-nine. That’s really cold. And that’s a big advantage for Chicago.”The Bears know this well. Over the past six weeks, Chicago leaned into Soldier Field’s conditions and used them to disrupt visiting offenses. Cold tightens hands. Plus, footing changes route depth and release speed.Stafford enters the matchup healthy and confident, but this test goes beyond arm strength. It demands patience, grip control, and trust in short throws. Brady’s message focused on adjustment, not weakness. Sunday’s game will show whether Stafford’s experience, preparation, and playoff poise can meet the challenge. If he adapts early, the weather becomes just another obstacle, not the story.Also Read: “Cry for sympathy and attention”: Tom Brady accused of seeking sympathy after post tied to Gisele Bündchen wedding","The Los Angeles Rams face the Chicago Bears on January 18, 2026, at Soldier Field.

Julio Rodríguez’s visit to his rebuilt Dominican Republic home shows gratitude and responsibility



For Julio Rodríguez, the offseason is not just about rest or preparation for another demanding MLB campaign. It is also a time to reconnect with his roots and reflect on the journey that shaped him. Recently, the Seattle Mariners center fielder visited the Dominican Republic home he helped rebuild last year, choosing a moment of quiet presence over publicity. The visit was understated and personal, far removed from packed stadiums and spotlight moments.As Rodríguez continues to rise as one of baseball’s most recognizable young stars, this return offered a deeper look into the values that continue to ground him. It was not about revisiting an achievement, but about staying connected to the place and people that remain central to his identity.The house that Rodríguez reconstructed is more than just a building. It is the appreciation, perpetuation and general duty towards community that supported him during his early years. Going to the house once more, Rodriguez demonstrated that giving back is not something to do at once, but on a regular basis.Those familiar with the visit described it as calm and intentional, centered on conversation and presence rather than recognition.When asked what he wanted in return for rebuilding the home, Rodríguez offered a response that resonated far beyond the moment. “All I’m asking for is a cup of coffee.”The quote reflected humility in its purest form. It did not concern recognition or reward, but time spent together and sincere connection. Fans quickly took to the comments to express their appreciation. One supporter wrote that Rodríguez is “on his way to winning the Roberto Clemente Award” for his impact beyond baseball. Another added, “You are a pride for us Dominicans,” echoing a sentiment repeated across social media.This visit made it clearer why Rodríguez has a bigger influence than box scores as he gets ready to enter the next chapter of his MLB career. To the fans, his visit back to the Dominican Republic was not only personal, but also brought back the fact that humility and purpose still lie at the core of his story.","Julio Rodríguez visited the Dominican Republic home he helped rebuild last year.

Bangladesh cricket in turmoil: What it means for the T20 World Cup?

Former India cricketer Manoj Tiwary has openly criticised the decision to remove Rohit Sharma as India’s ODI captain, suggesting that head coach Gautam Gambhir may have played a role in influencing the move. Tiwary, who has had a long-standing rivalry with Gambhir, feels the selectors and management disrespected Rohit by stripping him of the leadership role.Rohit, who retired from T20Is in June 2024 and Tests in May last year, had been performing strongly in ODIs and was looking to be at his peak ahead of the 2027 World Cup. Yet, when India’s squad for the Australia ODIs was announced in October, Shubman Gill was named the new captain. This decision surprised many, particularly as Rohit had led India to an ICC Champions Trophy victory in his last match as captain.Tiwary believes that while Ajit Agarkar , India’s chief selector, is a strong personality and capable of taking tough calls independently, Gambhir’s influence likely factored into Rohit’s removal.“I don't know what the main cause is. But knowing Ajit Agarkar, he is a personality. He is a decision maker. He will not take a step back in taking such steps. But whether he was influenced by someone to fire the gun from his shoulder is something we need to look at. A lot of things happen behind the scenes, which makes 1+1 2. Maybe the decision was made by the chief selector, and he was very upfront about it. Naturally, the coach’s inputs must be there.You cannot make the decision on your own. Both are equally responsible for whatever decision was made,” Tiwary told Sports Today.The former India batter admitted that Rohit’s removal has affected his interest in watching ODIs, despite the presence of Virat Kohli in the side. According to Tiwary, Rohit no longer appears as animated or commanding on the field.“See, there has been a lot of inconsistency in picking the playing XI, in my opinion. If I have to be brutally honest with you, I have lost interest in watching the ODI games. The things that have panned out of late, when the T20 World Cup-winning captain and the Champions Trophy-winning captain is removed from the captaincy, and the responsibility is given to the new guy, which I felt was not required. I have played with Rohit. We have a connection, so I didn't like how it panned out. I felt it was disrespectful to a cricketer who has given so much to the cricket lovers across the world. From that day, I lost a bit of interest. A lot of controversies, and I feel that is happening because the clarity is not there,” he said.Tiwary questioned the reasoning behind the decision, noting that Rohit’s proven leadership and track record should have warranted more respect.“It would have made this decision more sensible, because Rohit is a proven captain. He has won two ICC trophies. We nearly missed out in 2023. I felt Travis Head was lucky; it was his day. If we had won that, Rohit would have ended up with three trophies. I just wonder why you had doubts regarding Rohit playing the 2027 World Cup. That means you doubted his abilities. Why would you do that? When he has scored three double hundreds, there was no question of doubting him. A big player always gets the runs. The mindset with which he played in 2023, he is such a selfless cricketer, he wanted to make a statement. Doubting his ability was a big mistake, and then removing him from captaincy was a big mistake as well. I thought it shouldn't have happened. It cannot be cricketing logic behind his removal as the captain,” Tiwary added.The former player’s comments underline the controversy surrounding Rohit’s exit from ODI leadership and highlight lingering questions over the roles of both the coach and the selectors in the decision-making process.",Former India cricketer Manoj Tiwary has openly criticised the decision to remove Rohit Sharma as India’s ODI captain.

A red carpet moment that Hailee Steinfeld rushed home to share

The 2026 Golden Globes had no shortage of big wins and bigger fashion moments. But for Hailee Steinfeld, the night came down to one short exchange that mattered more than the spotlight. It was not about awards or cameras. It was about something she could not wait to take home and share.Steinfeld attended the 83rd Golden Globe Awards in Los Angeles as a presenter. While her film Sinners won major trophies, the actor left the red carpet with a story meant for just one person. Her husband is Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen.The moment came near the entrance to the event. Steinfeld revealed the story in her Beau Society newsletter published on Jan 16, 2026. She wrote that Adam Sandler waved her down as she arrived and started the conversation himself.""For context, Adam Sandler is a permanent fixture in our house,” Steinfeld wrote in the newsletter. She explained that Sandler movies play often at home and even noted that they had watched ""Just Go With It"" earlier in the week.According to Steinfeld, Sandler greeted her warmly and said, “Hey, buddy. I loved Sinners. You’re doing amazing.And congrats to Josh!” She made it clear this was said during their brief exchange on the Golden Globes red carpet before the ceremony.That line stuck with her. The actress wrote that she “could not wait” to tell Allen about it. The reason was simple. Sandler means something in their house. The couple even dressed as Bobby Boucher and Vicki Vallencourt from ""The Waterboy"" for Halloween in 2025.The night carried more meaning beyond the Sandler moment. ""Sinners"" won Best Score and Best Cinematic and Box Office Achievement during the ceremony. Steinfeld also reconnected with Jennifer Lawrence at the event. She wrote that Lawrence noticed her baby bump right away and reacted with pure joy. The two have known each other since Steinfeld was 13.Allen did not attend the event due to NFL commitments. Still, his reaction showed up later. After the ceremony, he reshared a photo of Steinfeld in her custom pink Prada gown on his Instagram Story with heart eyes and emojis. For Steinfeld, the Golden Globes offered trophies, praise, and old friendships. But the moment she valued most lasted seconds and ended with a phone call home. That alone explains why it stayed with her.Also Read: Jalen Hurts and Josh Allen net worth comparison: Salary, Contract, Endorsement, and more","Steinfeld attended the 83rd Golden Globe Awards in Los Angeles as a presenter.

According to Shams Charania of ESPN, Haliburton will actually miss the entire 2025-2026 season while he recovers from surgery on his right Achilles tendon.However, his fiancé, Jade Jones was still present during Saturday’s game. She even uploaded some pictures on her Instagram after the match. The word ""gameday"" was written in the middle of the pictures.Jade Jones’ Instagram picture turned heads as she was present during the match where her fiancé wasn’t playing. The picture appears to have been taken indoors on what seemed like a basketball court.Jones was seen wearing sleek black trousers and monogram-patterned pointed-toe shoes while standing with her feet slightly apart. The caption of the story read:“Game day..”Meanwhile, the Pacers star is now recovering after suffering a torn right Achilles that ended his season. About the same, Haliburton said to The Athletic’s Shakeia Taylor:“I don’t say I’m stuck in Indiana.. But I was here rehabbing, and I’m in the gym by myself with nobody else in there.”The injury followed him around and it took him a really long time to recover from the whole incident, mentally. Stating the same, he said:“I think about it every time I blink.. I think about it all the time.”In spite of the fact that the Pacers star was not playing tonight, they won against the New Orleans Pelicans. The Pacers advanced to the NBA Finals and defeated Oklahoma City in Game 7 just seven months ago.However, their star point guard Tyrese Haliburton suffered an Achilles injury that caused him to miss the entire 2025-26 campaign. He is currently going through rehab. In several interviews, talking about it, Haliburton admitted:“It just became sad after some time.. I just want to be able to do what I normally do and I wasn’t able to do that.”In October 2025, he talked about his mental health concerns after the injury. In an exclusive interview with Sports Illustrated, Haliburton discussed what it was like to feel underappreciated. He said:“I was in a dark place. My joy for basketball just wasn’t there.”He further said that he believes he will regain his full strength. However, he went on to say that he doesn't think he will ever be able to move on and be completely over it. Now, he is recovering quickly.Also read: Tyrese Haliburton opens up about his mental health struggles, and inspiring journey through a turbulent NBA season","Indiana Pacers star Tyrese Haliburton missed Saturday's game against the New Orleans Pelicans.

Chicago Cubs third baseman Alex Bregman is no stranger to attention on the field, but his latest off field moment found a different kind of spotlight. A recent Instagram Story shared by Bregman featured a polished photo with his wife Reagan Elizabeth Bregman, instantly drawing interest for its visual appeal rather than any caption or announcement. Set against a bold Cubs themed backdrop, the image leaned heavily into style and presentation.When Reagan quietly reposted the same photo without adding a word, it reinforced the mood of the moment. The result was a fashion driven post that blended sports, celebrity, and lifestyle in a way fans quickly noticed.The details of the post are its strength. It was immediately established by the fitted black mini dress that Reagan put on which created a balance between elegance and confidence.

The roomy fit and the subtle colors made his look clean and occasion suitable creating a coordinated couple look that felt intentional rather than casual.Together, their outfits projected a sense of polish and control that resonated strongly in a visual first medium like Instagram Stories.What was even more interesting about the moment was that there was no commentary.

Why Marcus Mariota still matters for the Washington Commanders’ long-term plans



Heisman Trivia with 2014 Winner Marcus Mariota & 2023 Winner Jayden Daniels | Washington Commanders

The Washington Commanders entered the 2025 season with big expectations after a solid 2024. But the season didn’t go as planned. Injuries and ups and downs, especially with rookie quarterback Jayden Daniels missing games, meant the team had to lean on their backups more than they expected.That reality pushed Marcus Mariota into a role few backups truly prepare for. While the Commanders struggled overall, Mariota’s presence quietly stabilized a fragile situation. He wasn’t spectacular, nor was he expected to be. What he offered was competence, experience, and an understanding of how to manage games when circumstances unravel.Washington’s struggles were not the result of Mariota stepping in. In fact, his play highlighted why a reliable backup quarterback remains one of the most undervalued assets in the NFL. A former No. 2 overall pick, Mariota started eight games and appeared in 11, his heaviest workload since 2022. His numbers were respectable, and his performances rarely put the Commanders in deeper trouble.NFL backup Marcus Mariota proved his value during the 2025 season, stepping in whenever Jayden Daniels was sidelined. His steady play helped stabilize the Commanders’ offense during a turbulent year.""The Commanders would have been exponentially worse if Mariota hadn't been available in relief,"" NFL insider Nick Shook revealed.Mariota’s contract situation now puts Washington in a tough spot. He’s been on consecutive one-year deals and got a small raise last offseason. Letting him go would be risky, especially for a team hoping to get back into playoff contention. Experienced backup quarterbacks like Mariota, who know the system and have locker-room credibility, aren’t easy to replace.Beyond the numbers, Mariota brings experience. His career path is somewhat similar to what Daniels is going through, and having once been considered a star in the making himself, he's aware of both the pressure and difficulties of playing in the NFL. That makes him a great mentor for a young quarterback facing his first challenges.Keeping Mariota around makes sense for the Commanders. He’s more than just a backup with his stabilizing presence, a mentor for Daniels, and a proven NFL quarterback who can step in when needed. Retaining him could make the difference between another shaky season and a team ready to compete.","The Washington Commanders entered the 2025 season with big expectations after a solid 2024.

What’s behind the delay in finalizing John Harbaugh’s Giants head coaching deal



The New York Giants are close to hiring John Harbaugh as their next head coach, but as of Thursday, nothing has been made official. Two days after the news first came out, the deal is still not finalized, and the exact timing of the announcement remains unclear.Harbaugh, a veteran NFL coach with a Super Bowl on his resume, is taking his time to review the opportunity. While the Giants are ready to bring him on board, he is making sure all the contract details are in order before signing. This methodical approach is not unusual for high-profile coaching moves, especially in the NFL’s fast-paced hiring market.According to NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero, Harbaugh has been ""very methodical about doing due diligence"" in his discussions with the Giants. ""Talks continue between the Giants and John Harbaugh, and a deal could get done in the coming hours. But Harbaugh has been very methodical about doing due diligence, and nothing is finalized yet,"" Pelissero said.While both sides are aligned on the hiring, finalizing a contract involves ensuring all terms, including staff roles, compensation, and performance incentives, meet mutual expectations. SNY’s Connor Hughes also reported that the deal could be completed imminently, emphasizing that he does not foresee the agreement falling through.Harbaugh was reportedly interested in the Giants even before leaving the Baltimore Ravens, showing how much he wants the job. It seems both sides are committed, and the announcement is likely just around the corner.The Giants are looking to bring consistency to a franchise that has lacked success over the last several seasons. Having the experience that Harbaugh brings would undoubtedly make an instantaneous difference. His hiring would be huge for New York as it continues to try to compete among the elite.For now, the focus is on wrapping up the final details. Everything points to John Harbaugh becoming the next Giants head coach, with only a few contract matters left to finalize before the move is officially announced. Once completed, the Giants will officially enter a new era under John Harbaugh’s leadership.Also Read: Jason Dart's involvement hints at bigger plan as Giants host John Harbaugh for interview","The New York Giants are close to hiring John Harbaugh as their next head coach.

Phillies secure J.T. Realmuto with $45 million deal after Bo Bichette goes to Mets,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/mlb/news/phillies-secure-j-t-realmuto-with-45-million-deal-after-bo-bichette-goes-to-mets/articleshow/126591612.cms,"J.T. Realmuto (Image Source: Getty)

Phillies secure J.T. Realmuto to anchor pitching staff

Bo Bichette’s Mets move reshapes Phillies’ offseason strategy

The Philadelphia Phillies quickly locked up the man they admired for a long time: catcher J.T. Realmuto, with a three-year, $45 million contract. This deal comes at a critical juncture in the offseason, when the Phillies just lost out on one of their top free-agent targets, Bo Bichette, to the New York Mets. Philadelphia clearly values continuity and leadership as it recalibrates its roster plans around the All-Star catcher.Bichette changed the Phillies' offseason template with his absence, but Realmuto's return keeps one of the toughest positions on the field in place. Despite being 39 years old, the veteran catcher is still a steady contributor in the lineup and provides a steady hand behind the plate for the pitching staff. Philadelphia opted for stability by avoiding frenzies and quick changes, and they paid for a player who has been at the heart of its recent success.As for Realmuto, he has been one of baseball's most complete catchers since joining the Philadelphia Phillies in 2019. He has been named an All-Star and has won Gold Gloves over the years, establishing a reputation for plus defense, game-calling, and durability. The $45 million agreement runs through the 2028 season but has triggers that could raise the deal's maximum value.Realmuto keeps churning out solid performances on the field. He provided double-digit home runs, respectable on-base figures, and decent defensive metrics behind the plate last year. But, most importantly for the Phillies, his internal knowledge of the rotation and bullpen is considered irreplaceable. Keeping Realmuto means the organization keeps chemistry intact while younger pitchers continue to develop.Earlier this week, the Mets made waves by signing Bo Bichette to a 3-year, $126 million contract. The shortstop had been heavily linked to Philadelphia, and the announcement of his destination in New York meant the Phillies had to change course swiftly. Rather than overreacting in an emotional response, the club went with a known commodity in the clubhouse.Hitting Bichette in New York and adding a high-impact bat to an already difficult division make life far more difficult for any National League East contender. Having acquired the player, the Phillies now turn their attention to complementary moves that will deepen the roster and address holes. While the disappointment of missing out on Bichette lingers, the re-signing of Realmuto signals a commitment to stability and a belief that their existing core can continue to contend.Also Read: Nico Hoerner vs Nick Castellanos net worth comparison: A closer look at earnings, contracts, and who wins","Phillies secure J.T.

The Cleveland Cavaliers visit the Philadelphia 76ers on January 16, 2026, in a game that matters for both teams. Each is sitting close to .500, and the Eastern Conference standings leave little room for long losing streaks. This matchup offers a clear test of depth, health, and late-game execution.Donovan Mitchell and Tyrese Maxey will be at the center of everything. With key teammates out on both sides, the ball will be in their hands more than usual. Philadelphia gets the benefit of playing at Xfinity Mobile Arena, but the recent results between these teams show this is far from a one-sided matchup.Philadelphia is favored by a small margin at home. The 76ers are priced around -1.5, while Cleveland sits near +106 on the moneyline. The total is mostly set at 235.5 points, with a few books closer to 232.5. The line suggests a quick-paced game led by guard scoring, with Philadelphia holding a slight edge on its home floor.Cleveland comes in with a 23-19 record. The Cavaliers have had issues covering the spread overall, but they have been reliable as road underdogs against Eastern Conference opponents, covering 11 of their last 12 in that role.Philadelphia is 22-17 and has been sharp in January with a 5-2 record.During that stretch, the 76ers have ranked near the top of the league on both ends of the floor and have consistently covered at home, particularly following a loss.The Philadelphia 76ers have averaged just over 114 points across their last five games, including a comfortable win over Washington. Cleveland, however, has had the upper hand in this matchup recently. The Cavaliers beat Philadelphia 133-106 earlier this week and have won five of the last six meetings. One of those wins came in November, when Mitchell scored 46 in a 132-121 result. That said, Cleveland has dropped four straight road games following wins, a trend that has raised concerns.Tyrese Maxey over 26.5 points stands out given how often he has been scoring at that level. Donovan Mitchell over 6.5 assists is worth a look with Cleveland short-handed and relying more on him to create. Evan Mobley under 0.5 made threes fits his recent shooting pattern, while VJ Edgecombe over 1.5 steals has hit consistently.Philadelphia holds a small advantage due to home court and healthier star availability. The expectation is a close game, with the 76ers edging out a 118-114 win. The lean is toward Philadelphia -1.5, with the total slightly favoring the under if the pace slows late.","The Cleveland Cavaliers visit the Philadelphia 76ers on January 16, 2026.

Why IShowSpeed deleted his Cairo IRL stream: Full details explained,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us-streamers/why-ishowspeed-deleted-his-cairo-irl-stream-full-details-explained/articleshow/126591585.cms,"Image Via Instagram

“Speed Does Africa”

Why IShowSpeed removed the Cairo IRL stream after going live in Egypt





IShowSpeed surprised fans after deleting his Cairo, Egypt IRL stream from YouTube just hours after it went live. The stream was part of histour extension and came right after a historic moment where Speed became the first streamer to broadcast live from inside the Great Pyramid of Giza. Because of the hype around that achievement, many viewers expected the Cairo IRL stream to be one of the biggest highlights of the tour. Instead, its sudden removal sparked confusion, speculation, and viral discussion across social media.The deletion occurred on the 16th of January 2026 and quickly sparked many questions about what exactly went wrong. Though the full Cairo VOD for the IRL does not exist anymore, the pyramid video has continued to stream and has passed the million views milestone. This sort of deletion has piqued the interest of the fans even more, given the fact that it's not the Egyptian trip in general, but the Cairo experience, that seems to have been the problem.During the Cairo stream, Speed repeatedly spoke about strict rules and heavy restrictions around filming. He mentioned that almost everything required approval, which limited his ability to move freely and interact naturally with the city.Compared to earlier stops in Africa, such as Kenya and Ethiopia, Speed appeared visibly frustrated and openly said the Cairo experience felt disappointing. These comments stood out during the livestream and may have played a role in the decision to later remove the VOD.Another major problem was fan sniping. Eventually, large crowds of people started gathering around Speed, raising safety concerns and almost forcing the stream to go off the air early. This created a lot of speculation that local authorities or organizers must have intervened, considering how strict Egypt's laws concerning public filming are. Although nothing is declared on the government's side about the pressure it exerted, according to many, it was very difficult to handle because of the crowd issues along with the filming regulations.Interestingly, there is continuity with the live pyramid stream itself being live, possibly being properly approved and moderated. In contrast, the Cairo IRL live stream features some random events with interactions with the general public and expressions of frustration, possibly enough to make them uncomfortable with keeping this live.Ultimately, there has not been any official statement by IShowSpeed to explain the deletion. Fans are, for now, putting together pieces from the livestream, social media reactions, and what remains on his channel. The Cairo IRL stream may be gone, but the conversation on it keeps growing and makes it one of the talking points of his Africa tour.Also Read: IShowSpeed makes streaming history with first-ever live stream inside Egypt’s Great Pyramid","IShowSpeed deleted his Cairo, Egypt IRL stream from YouTube just hours after it went live.

Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson have always supported each other, despite the latter’s move to Dallas Mavericks

Klay Thompson surpassed Damian Lillard to become the fourth all-time leader in 3-point field goals made, cementing his place in NBA history with an incredible display of skill. This noteworthy accomplishment occurred on Thursday night during a thrilling game that showcased Thompson's accuracy from beyond the arc. He is currently at 2,805 and counting.Following this remarkable achievement, Stephen Curry shared a message of encouragement for the fellow NBA great. To put things in perspective, Curry and Thompson formed one of the greatest backcourts in NBA history for 13 years, but their collaboration came to a stop when Thompson moved to Dallas in the 2024 offseason.In the NBA's three-point record books, Klay Thompson adds another chapter. In the NBA's all-time record for three-pointers made, the veteran Dallas Mavericks player overtook Damian Lillard. With 1:17 remaining in the second quarter, Thompson moved past the Portland Trail Blazers star thanks to a trifecta.The news made Golden State Warriors legend Stephen Curry extremely happy. His reaction tells it all as Thompson now has 2,805 three-pointers. He took to his Instagram Stories, shared the scores and wrote:“Yeahhh Killa!”With 4,201 triples and counting, his Splash Brother and former Golden State teammate Steph Curry continues to retain the top spot.Because of their near-perfect three-point shooting mechanics and exceptional efficiency, the two backcourt stars were a nightmare to defend in the half-court and during transition.Thompson, on the other hand, is shooting close to 37% from the field and averaging 11.3 points in 38 games thus far. Despite missing two entire seasons in 2019–20 and 2020–21 due to ACL and Achilles injuries, Thompson accomplished the feat. In any case, he will always be regarded as one of the best shooters in the game.Before Thompson signed a sign-and-trade with the Dallas Mavericks in 2024, Curry and Thompson shared four titles in the Bay. He has consistently expressed interest in Klay. He even discussed the possibility of Thompson returning to the Bay this season under Mike Dunleavy Jr.He wrote Thompson a four-word message about it in December 2025. Curry told Tim MacMahon and Anthony Slater of ESPN:“It would be unbelievable.. If that time comes and that conversation is had, of course, I'm calling him and saying, 'We want you back.' And hopefully, that would be a welcome message to him. But as we stand right now, that does seem like a far-distant reality. But so did him leaving.""Additionally, they have helped one another. During the Golden State Warriors' Christmas Day game against the Dallas Mavericks last year, Curry paid tribute to his buddy and former teammate by donning Thompson's sneakers.Following the Mavs' 126-116 defeat, Thompson talked on witnessing Curry wear his iconic shoes. Thompson stated to reporters:""It was great. It was really cool.. Wish he didn't get a win in 'em, but it was awesome. A lot of respect.""After the game, Curry joked that he didn't have any intention behind his choice of sneakers, attributing it to a coincidence that Thompson's sneaker shoes were in his size.Also read: Heartwarming family moments steal the spotlight as Stephen Curry and Ayesha Curry ring in 2026 with love, gratitude, and courtside joy","Klay Thompson surpassed Damian Lillard to become the fourth all-time leader in 3-point field goals made.

Bears hold a clear weather edge

The Los Angeles Rams are heading into one of the toughest environments in football, and Tom Brady believes the weather alone could tilt the balance. Ahead of the Rams’ divisional-round clash against the Chicago Bears, Brady offered a clear warning about how extreme cold can quietly work against quarterbacks who are used to warmer conditions.The game at Soldier Field is expected to be played in freezing temperatures, with strong winds making conditions even harsher. For Brady, who built much of his playoff legacy in New England winters, this is not just small talk. He knows exactly how unforgiving January football in Chicago can be.Speaking on FOX Sports, Brady admitted that even experienced quarterbacks can be “softened” by time spent in warmer climates. While he acknowledged that Matthew Stafford has played in cold-weather cities before, Brady stressed that habits change quickly.He pointed to his own move from New England to Tampa Bay as an example. After years of playing in freezing conditions, he said it did not take long to adjust to warmth and lose that edge in the cold. According to him, the difference between 30 degrees and sub-zero wind chills can be massive, especially when grip, muscle movement, and timing come into play.Stafford spent years with the Detroit Lions, but many of those games were played indoors.Since joining the Los Angeles Rams, he has been based in California, where cold-weather preparation is not part of daily life. That matters because cold air can stiffen fingers, slow reactions, and affect ball control all critical for a quarterback who relies on timing and precision.Reports suggest Stafford may even use extra gear, such as thermal layers, to cope with the cold. But Brady warned that too much protection can also limit movement. Finding the right balance is a challenge in itself.Brady believes the Bears have a strong advantage simply because of familiarity. Chicago has already played multiple games in freezing conditions this season, and their players are used to adjusting routines, equipment, and mindset accordingly.The Rams, by contrast, are coming off a warm-weather playoff win and now face a sudden shift. For an offense that thrives on rhythm and passing efficiency, swirling winds and icy air could disrupt their flow.Brady didn't count the Rams out, even though he warned them. He praised their coaching and offensive flexibility, saying that smart changes might still help them stay competitive.Still, his message was clear: talent alone may not be enough. In Chicago, survival often comes down to who handles the cold better and Brady knows from experience that winter football rarely shows mercy",The Los Angeles Rams face the Chicago Bears at Soldier Field on Sunday.

Jack Eichel's OT goal secures Vegas Golden Knights' strong comeback once again



NHL Highlights | Maple Leafs vs. Golden Knights - January 15, 2026

Jack Eichel scored at 2:44 of overtime as the Vegas Golden Knights finished off a thrilling late-game rally to defeat the Toronto Maple Leafs 6-5 Thursday night at T-Mobile Arena. The winning goal capped off the Golden Knights’ sixth straight win and is the latest impressive display from one of the league’s hottest teams.Vegas was down by two goals in the third period but surged back to tie the game with only seven seconds left in the game. They won the game in the overtime period. The game was marred by the Toronto team's poor defense, despite their offense putting up a great display.Jack Eichel provided the crucial element with the assist in overtime after Mark Stone chipped the loose puck from a 2-on-1 attempt.Stone spotted Eichel on the backside and caught him with the pass, and the forward easily deceived the shot with a backhand deke before putting the puck past Toronto goaltender Joseph Woll.“We’re competing when we don’t have the puck in overtime,” Eichel said. “[Stone] hits a post right there before we score, and we had a few changes. Credit to the whole group. It was a come-from-behind win, and we found a way to get a goal late there.”Toronto dominated most of the first period, taking a 3-1 lead thanks to goals from Morgan Rielly, William Nylander, and Auston Matthews. John Tavares and Scott Laughton also scored goals, but Toronto could not finish off the game.Nylander scored and assisted, then left early in the first with a lower body injury. That’s just another problem Toronto has. Woll stopped 27 shots in goal as they fell to 23-16-8 with a key road game loss.Despite earning a point, Toronto was left frustrated since they lost another lead they had towards the end of the match. Vegas currently leads the NHL with eight overtime victories when trailing in the third period this year.

Sidney Crosby gives Penguins an early lead as power play dominates Flyers’ struggles



NHL Highlights | Flyers vs. Penguins - January 15, 2026

The Penguins snapped their three-game streak without a goal with a resounding 6-3 victory over the Philadelphia Flyers at PPG Paints Arena last night. The Penguins received a boost with the return of Sidney Crosby, who contributed a goal and an assist, while Evgeni Malkin and Tommy Novak chipped in two assists apiece. Goaltender Stuart Skinner also had 30 saves, keeping the Penguins ahead all the way.This was a much-needed win for the Penguins, as they had only scored two goals in the last three matches. The Philadelphia, on the other hand, continues to struggle, as the Flyers have extended their losing streak to five games, having been outscored 25-9 in the process. Matvei Michkov, Rodrigo Abols, and Nick Seeler found the net for Philadelphia, but it wasn’t enough to challenge Pittsburgh’s balanced attack.Pittsburgh established an early lead with Justin Brazeau scoring on a power play just seconds before the first period’s end. Bryan Rust added a second power-play goal midway through the period, followed by Egor Chinakhov extending the lead to 3-0 in the second. Philadelphia responded quickly with Abols deflecting a shot from Cam York, but the Flyers’ early efforts weren’t enough to slow the Penguins. Goalie Samuel Ersson allowed three goals on 14 shots before Aleksei Kolosov replaced him in relief, making 13 saves.Special teams were a key factor, with Crosby converting a third-period power play to make it 5-1. Philadelphia’s ongoing difficulties on the penalty kill have been costly, as they have allowed 12 power-play goals in their past eight games. Connor Dewar added another for Pittsburgh before Seeler and Michkov finished the scoring for the Flyers, making it 6-3.The win for Pittsburgh showed their strength in taking advantage of crucial moments and dictating play, while for Philadelphia, it seems their season of struggles continues. Flyers head coach Rick Tocchet revealed a lack of discipline in play, such as penalties for stick infractions and poor positioning on some plays. As both teams can expect a long season, it will be necessary for both Pittsburgh to keep up their strong play and for Philadelphia to get back on track after such a tough stretch.Also Read: Sidney Crosby revisits the moment Penguins were called soft, revealing what Michel Therrien really meant back then","Pittsburgh Penguins beat Philadelphia Flyers 6-3 at PPG Paints Arena last night.

‘I got kicked off the team’: How Travis Kelce turned one career-wrecking mistake into a $90 Million net worth,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/i-got-kicked-off-the-team-how-travis-kelce-turned-one-career-wrecking-mistake-into-a-90-million-net-worth/articleshow/126569218.cms,"Travis Kelce net worth reflects NFL dominance, media ownership, and long-term financial discipline. (Image via Getty)

From suspension and rookie contracts to NFL extensions, endorsements, and media power

Why Travis Kelce’s net worth story still starts with a failed drug test

Travis Kelce did not build his wealth quietly. He also did not build it overnight. Long before the Taylor Swift headlines, Kelce was already one of the most financially successful non-quarterbacks in NFL history. His $90 million net worth did not come from luck or timing. It came from discipline learned the hard way.As of early 2026, the Kansas City Chiefs tight end has turned sustained on-field dominance into a diversified financial operation that spans NFL contracts, endorsements, media rights, and equity investments. This is not a story about celebrity proximity. It is a story about failure, leverage, and long-term planning.According to Celebrity Net Worth, Travis Kelce’s net worth is estimated at $90 million as of 2025, a figure that aligns with reporting from Forbes and multiple contract databases. Kelce earned over $100 million in NFL contract value alone, before endorsements, bonuses, and media deals.Kelce entered the league as a third-round pick in 2013. His rookie contract paid $3.12 million over four years, including a signing bonus of just over $700,000.He missed nearly his entire rookie season due to injury, which delayed both production and leverage. That changed quickly.In 2016, Kelce signed a five-year, $46 million extension with $20 million guaranteed. In 2020, he added a four-year, $57.25 million extension with $28 million guaranteed. In April 2024, he signed a two-year, $34.25 million extension, including $17 million guaranteed.By the 2025 season, Kelce’s salary with Kansas City was estimated at $17 million, according to league contract figures. He accepted team-friendly structures to keep the roster competitive, a decision that helped produce three Super Bowl championships while preserving long-term brand value.Off the field, Kelce’s income now tilts heavily toward endorsements and media. Industry estimates place his endorsement earnings at $30 to $32 million annually, with partners including Nike, State Farm, Bud Light, Pfizer, McDonald’s, DirecTV, T-Mobile, and Casa Azul Tequila.The largest single shift came in 2024, when Kelce and his brother Jason secured a reported $100 million deal with Amazon ’s Wondery platform for their “New Heights” podcast. The deal transformed the show from a side project into a long-term media asset with advertising, licensing, and live event revenue.Kelce has also taken equity positions rather than one-time endorsement checks. In 2024, the Kelce brothers became major investors in Garage Beer Co., which reached a $200 million valuation following outside investment in 2025. He also holds stakes in multiple consumer, wellness, and lifestyle brands.Kelce’s financial discipline traces back to a moment that nearly ended his career before it began.In 2010, while at the University of Cincinnati, Kelce tested positive for marijuana and was suspended for the entire season. He lost his scholarship and was removed from the team. Reflecting on that period, Kelce later said, “I got kicked off the team.”The suspension forced Kelce into mandatory therapy and a full reset of his approach to football and life. It also triggered a position change to tight end full time, a move that unlocked his career.By his senior season in 2012, Kelce earned first-team All-Big East honors, setting the stage for his NFL entry. That early failure became the foundation for how he manages risk, money, and opportunity.Kelce’s business approach mirrors that lesson. He avoids reckless spending. He reinvests into longevity. His real estate choices emphasize privacy and appreciation. His lifestyle supports brand alignment rather than undermining it.Philanthropy is also structured. Through his Eighty-Seven & Running Foundation, Kelce funds education, mentoring, and community development initiatives in Cleveland and Kansas City. His contributions focus on sustained programs rather than one-time donations.Looking ahead, Kelce’s financial outlook remains strong regardless of retirement timing. His current contract runs through the 2025 season. His media ventures, equity positions, and endorsement appeal do not depend on weekly snap counts.Kelce acknowledged the physical toll of the NFL on the Jan. 6, 2026 episode of his “New Heights” podcast, saying, “There’s a lot of love for the game that’s still there and I don’t think I’ll ever lose that.” He also made clear that future decisions will be based on health and readiness, not financial necessity.Travis Kelce’s net worth did not come from fame. Fame amplified it. The wealth came from turning a near-career-ending mistake into structure, leverage, and ownership. That part of the story never changes.","According to Celebrity Net Worth, Travis Kelce’s net worth is estimated at $90 million as of 2025. Kelce earned over $100 million in NFL contract value alone, before endorsements, bonuses, and media deals. He accepted team-friendly structures to keep the roster competitive while preserving long-term brand value.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126569396,imgsize-44532,width-400,resizemode-4/travis-kelce-net-worth-financial-empire.jpg"

Lakers trade chatter shifts focus from Austin Reaves to Luka Doncic as the more valuable trade move

Online backlash erupts over Luka Doncic trade speculation

Following the recent controversy surrounding Lakers’ shooting guard Austin Reaves’ trade from the franchise, a new debate has sparked, going far beyond Austin Reaves. What started as a hypothetical discussion has taken a turn to become one of the franchise’s most heated controversies involving Luka Doncic.Over the past few weeks, there have been talks about whether the team's core players could stay competitive long term. With maximum contracts coming up and the pressure to chase a championship, even star players like Luka Doncic are being considered for a trade. Max Kellerman’s recent comments have drawn attention from not just the fans but across the entire NBA.The controversy initially gained attention when Rich Paul suggested a hypothetical scenario involving a trade between Austin Reaves and Jaren Jackson Jr.on the “Game Over with Max Kellerman and Rich Paul” podcast. While Paul later clarified that the conversation was never meant to signify an actual trade plan, the damage was already done. Fans and analysts quickly started questioning whether the Lakers were trying to move Reaves from the franchise.Things took a turn when, instead of focusing on moving Reaves, Kellerman suggested that trading Luka Doncic could make more sense.He justified his statement, saying, “I like Austin Reaves a lot, as does Rich, by the way”, indicating that Luka’s trade value would bring a significantly larger return, “I can get x for Austin. I can get 3x for Luka”, Max added. Nonetheless, this idea shocked many, given Doncic’s status and role as a star player for any franchise lucky enough to have him.Fans have reacted with backlash and frustration towards the discussion around the Lakers, especially the idea of trading Doncic. One fan commented, “These guys don’t need a mike lol. I could do this job if I just get up there and say random stuff lol”. While another added, “Kellerman had a salary bonus by midget on his left and has become Kellerdumb”. “Lmfao. Full blown re***** these two. How about that LeBron guy who hasn’t played a l*** of defense in years?”, a fan added. While someone bluntly pointed out, “Yet another reason why Max should stick to boxing”. “Does every podcast have to be about the lakers? There’s 29 other teams do they talk about anyone else”, a fan commented over a clip if the podcast shared on X.Overall, these reactions suggest that fans see the bold take as absurd and attention-seeking rather than serious basketball analysis, which implies that the analysts are saying just to spark controversy and not because the idea makes any real sense.Also Read: Skip Bayless accuses LeBron James of trying to “push Austin Reaves out the back door”","Max Kellerman suggested that the Lakers should trade Luka Doncic instead of Austin Reaves.

Brady explains how family challenges clarified his decision to walk away

Tom Brady spent more than two decades creating an unprecedented legacy in the NFL with the Patriots. However, his final years in the field were filled with personal problems, which fueled his underperformance on the field. In a recent interview, Brady acknowledged that his divorce from Gisele Bündchen deeply affected his final season in the league.While appearing on The Herd, Brady was asked about Aaron Rodgers and the difficulty of knowing when to retire. Brady explained that his last season came during a period of emotional strain, and it affected his abilities as a player and took a toll on him mentally. He also reflected on how he had no regrets when he decided that it was time to tap out in 2023 after 23 seasons.During his appearance on the podcast, he admitted to the challenges at the time, saying, “My last season was tough. I was going through a lot of just a personal family issue, and it was a challenge, and it was a very… It just took a lot out of me in terms of my ability to continue to play.”Brady rarely spoke publicly about the personal side of his career while he was active. This time, however, he made it clear that the emotional weight off the field mattered as much as the physical demands on it.Further on, when discussing retirement, Brady emphasized that he felt no sense of regret and wanted to settle down as a family man.He stated, “I had 23 years of [football], so I didn’t think I was missing anything, retiring. I felt like I always had a goal — 45. I was 45 years old, I wanted to spend time with my kids.” That perspective helped him accept walking away after the 2022 season and fully stepping aside in 2023 following his time with the Buccaneers.Brady added that being present for his kids mattered more than chasing another comeback. He said, “I felt like, okay, now it’s time for me to be at all my kids’ games. They’ve been to enough of their dad’s games.” That shift in priorities explains why his final retirement felt permanent.Since the divorce, both Brady and Bündchen have moved forward with their lives. She remarried in 2025 and welcomed another child with Joaquim Valente, while Brady remains focused on his role at Fox Sports and raising his three children. Though he has been seen publicly with Alix Earle, he has stayed quiet about his personal life.Also read: Tom Brady breaks silence and makes his priorities clear amid rumors of a potential romance with Alix Earle",Tom Brady said his divorce from Gisele Bündchen affected his final season in the NFL.

Ryan Nugent-Hopkins will make history Sunday when he plays his 1,000th NHL game against the St. Louis Blues at Rogers Place. The milestone represents something no Wayne Gretzky, Mark Messier, or Grant Fuhr ever accomplished in Edmonton.Nugent-Hopkins will become the first player to play 1,000 games wearing only an Oilers uniform from start to finish. The achievement carries added weight considering the era Nugent-Hopkins endured in Edmonton.Selected first overall in 2011, he arrived during what became known as the Decade of Darkness. High draft picks arrived with suffocating pressure and departed just as quickly when results didn't materialize. Taylor Hall was traded to New Jersey.Jordan Eberle went to the New York Islanders. Justin Schultz left as a free agent. Nail Yakupov flamed out and was dealt. Fresh faces showed up every year, and soon another was being shipped out in the opposite direction.Nugent-Hopkins admitted there were moments when he thought his turn would come. ""There were definitely moments where I thought I'd be getting the call,"" the 32-year-old said this week.""I was really good friends with Justin Schultz, and things went from really good to pretty sour pretty quickly for him here. Then Jordan, and Taylor, and a lot of other guys left too."" He paused before adding the obvious thought that crossed his mind during those years.""Yeah, there were moments when I thought I could be next on the block,"" he said. ""I'm sure there were offers."" Former teammate Sam Gagner believes Nugent-Hopkins's personality kept him in Edmonton when others were moved.""He's such a good teammate, such a low-maintenance guy,"" Gagner said. ""Maybe when you're looking for problems or looking for change, he's the last place you look?"" Current teammate Curtis Lazar explained what makes Nugent-Hopkins so valuable on the ice.""When he gets the puck, everyone on the bench just exhales,"" Lazar said. ""We know he'll do the right thing with it."" Darnell Nurse echoed that sentiment when describing his longtime teammate's impact. ""He's an exhale,"" Nurse said. ""I mean, you couldn't put it better.""Nugent-Hopkins was drafted ahead of Gabriel Landeskog, Jonathan Huberdeau, Mark Scheifele, and Nikita Kucherov in 2011. He ranks as the fourth-highest scorer from that draft class and will be the first to reach 1,000 games.He currently has 785 points and remains under contract through three more seasons at a $5.125 million cap hit. When his career concludes, Nugent-Hopkins will lead the franchise in games played wearing blue and orange, a fitting legacy for a player who survived Edmonton's darkest years to reach its brightest.","Nugent-Hopkins will become the first player to play 1,000 games wearing only an Oilers uniform from start to finish.

The Rasmus Andersson trade saga appears to be reaching its conclusion. The Athletic's Pierre LeBrun reported on Friday that talks have heated up significantly around the Calgary Flames defenseman, with multiple teams pushing to acquire the pending unrestricted free agent.Andersson played Thursday night in the Flames' 3-1 victory over Chicago, logging 26:55 of ice time in what could potentially be his final game in a Calgary uniform. The 29-year-old defenseman has been the subject of trade speculation dating back to last summer as he approaches free agency in July.""As others have noted, things have heated up on the Rasmus Andersson trade front,"" LeBrun tweeted earlier today. ""He wasn't held out of the lineup last night, but sense is talks have intensified. Let's see where it goes over the next 24-48 hours as to whether it gets done or not.”The Dallas Stars, Vegas Golden Knights, Toronto Maple Leafs, and Detroit Red Wings have all shown interest in acquiring the right-shot defenseman. The Golden Knights nearly completed a deal during the offseason, but negotiations ultimately fell apart. Ottawa has also expressed interest, though reports indicate the Senators are on Andersson's six-team no-trade list.Calgary general manager Craig Conroy has reportedly set a steep asking price for his top defenseman. The Flames are seeking the equivalent of two first-round picks, including a 2026 first-rounder and either an NHL-ready defenseman or a top prospect close to making the jump.Andersson has posted 10 goals and 29 points in 47 games this season while averaging a team-high 24:12 of ice time. He quarterbacks the power play and remains one of the most valuable right-shot defensemen available on the trade market at a manageable $4.55 million cap hit.The Flames sit at 20-23-4 and have dropped five of their last six games, firmly positioning themselves as sellers ahead of the trade deadline. Calgary already owns two first-round picks in 2026 from the Noah Hanifin trade to Vegas and could add another through an Andersson deal.The timing becomes critical with the Olympics approaching next month. Andersson will captain Sweden after leading them to bronze at last spring's World Hockey Championship. The Flames prefer to move him before he departs for Milano Cortina, making the next 48 hours potentially decisive in ending months of speculation about his future","Rasmus Andersson has been the subject of trade speculation dating back to last summer as he approaches free agency in July.

Colorado Avalanche goaltender Mackenzie Blackwood is back after injury recovery to face the Predators

Also read:

Colorado Avalanche goaltender Mackenzie Blackwood has returned to the club for the first time after sustaining an injury. He is all set to face the Nashville Predators on Friday at Ball Arena. As per reports, the goaltender has missed six games due to a lower-body injury but was activated off injured reserve on Wednesday and cleared to play.Earlier, Blackwood played in Colorado’s last game on Wednesday, stopping 12 of 13 shots against the St. Louis Blues in a 6-1 victory to improve to 13-1-1 on the season. However, Blackwood did not participate, although there was no word after the skate about him being hurt. Let’s take a closer look at the Avalanche goaltender's return to the team. Colorado Avalanche goaltender Mackenzie Blackwood is slated to defend the home crease against the Predators on Friday, Evan Rawal of the Denver Gazette reports. As per reports, Blackwood missed the last six games due to a lower-body injury, but he was activated off injured reserve on Wednesday and has been officially cleared to return two days later.Earlier, the Avalanche placed Mackenzie Blackwood on injured reserve on Friday as the team prepares to head east for a three-game road trip.The 29-year-old has been stellar for the Avalanche when healthy this year, going 13-1-1 with a 2.07 GAA and .924 save percentage over 15 appearances.The Avalanche goaltender is playing its first game since New Year’s Eve. He needed time to recover from a precautionary injury the team didn’t want to let worsen. Their dominant record allows them to take this route.Meanwhile, the Avalanche are 3-2-1 in their last six games, dating back to when Devon Toews and Gabe Landeskog were injured. They played six games in 10 nights but have since had the last three days off. The Avs will also have the weekend off before their next game, which is scheduled for this upcoming Monday.As for the match schedule, Colorado will be seen playing in Carolina on Saturday, Florida on Sunday, and Tampa Bay on Tuesday. Without Blackwood available for any of these games, they might be inclined to utilize Scott Wedgewood more than initially anticipated.","Colorado Avalanche goaltender Mackenzie Blackwood has returned to the club for the first time after sustaining an injury.

Why fans are noticing Xavier Worthy again

The Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver, Xavier Worthy has recently found himself back in the spotlight following updates around his health and his future. While trending moments come and go quickly in today’s league, this one carries real significance for how teams evaluate speed receivers, durability and long-term development.With his latest tweet, he has set a tone for the entire league. It was a moment that reflects where Worthy stands and where the NFL may be heading.The recent reason why Worthy is trending now comes from a recent update related to his recovery and readiness moving forward. After playing through physical limitations, Worthy addressed his situation publicly, drawing attention from fans and analysts who had been closely monitoring his situationThis tweet by Xavier gave fans a sneak peak of the future he is about to deliver.The reaction on this one was swift. Supporters weighed in on whether injuries had quietly limited his production while others focused on what a fully healthy version of Worthy could look like in Kansas City’s offense.Worthy entered the NFL with high expectations, built around elite speed and big-play potential. Those traits remain intact but his early career has also highlighted how difficult it is for speed-based receivers to stay consistently available in a physical league.The attention is not rooted in doubt about his talent but in curiosity about what comes next if his health stabilizes. For players like Worthy, availability often determines whether they become situational weapons or foundational pieces in an offense.The next phase for Worthy is simple in concept but difficult in execution. The coming months will shape how he is viewed not just by fans but by decision-makers across the NFL. Every rep, snap count, and usage adjustment will be closely watched, especially in an offense that values timing and reliability as much as explosiveness.Xavier Worthy is trending because his story sits at the intersection of talent, timing, and league-wide evolution. This is not just about one player’s update, it is about how the NFL continues to adapt to speed, youth, and sustainability.If Worthy capitalizes on this moment, the trend will fade into something more meaningful- proof that development when handled correctly still wins in today’s NFL.Also read - Shannon Sharpe breaks the internet with a bold new look and a flashy viral moment","Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver, Xavier Worthy has recently found himself back in the spotlight following updates around his health and his future.

The biggest MMA talking points that shaped Thursday’s conversation



Mid-January is usually a quiet stretch on the UFC calendar, a short pause before the action picks up pace again. But Thursday, January 15, 2026, was different. Injury news, title questions, and suspensions kept the MMA world buzzing and fans scrolling late into the night, including the announcement of a lengthy ban for Mohammed Usman following a failed drug test.From major fight plans being scrapped to unexpected developments around championship belts, the news cycle reminded everyone how fast things can change in mixed martial arts. Even without a fight night attached, the storylines carried real weight for what lies ahead over the next few months.One of the most serious updates of the day came away from the cage. Mohammed Usman was handed a 30-month suspension after failing an out of competition drug test for testosterone and misleading investigators until evidence was presented.The ban will keep him sidelined until April 9, 2028, effectively putting his fighting career on pause for more than two years and sending a clear message about enforcement.From there, the conversation quickly shifted back to the sport’s biggest names and biggest business decisions. The headline item centered on UFC CEO Dana White, who made it clear he is no longer pushing for a long-discussed showdown between Conor McGregor and Michael Chandler.Once seen as a guaranteed blockbuster, the matchup now appears firmly off the table, leaving fans split on whether the fight still matters or if the moment has simply passed.Injury news also made its way into the mix. UFC 325 lost a main card bout after a fighter suffered a ruptured ACL, continuing a frustrating pattern of late card changes. It is another reminder of how quickly fight cards can change, even deep into training camps, and why fans have grown cautious about getting too attached to matchups too early.At the championship level, UFC officials addressed growing questions around the lightweight division. The promotion does not plan to strip champion Ilia Topuria, despite his current situation. Instead, internal discussions have focused on the possibility of an interim title defense involving either Paddy Pimblett or Justin Gaethje, who are set to face each other at UFC 324. That idea alone adds more intrigue to a division that already has no shortage of contenders waiting their turn.Elsewhere, Arman Tsarukyan opened up about his finances, Alex Pereira was spotted sparring a heavyweight in Brazil, and Georges St Pierre reminded everyone why he still commands respect. Kamaru Usman admitted regret over sharing a private video chat with Anthony Joshua, while lighter moments ranged from wild knockout clips to viral training footage and social media oddities.By the end of the night, one thing was clear. Even without a live event, the MMA world rarely slows down. With UFC 324 just a week away and major decisions looming at the top of the sport, Thursday felt less like filler and more like a preview of chaos still to come.",The UFC announced a 30-month suspension for Mohammed Usman after a failed drug test.

Why Mitch Marner feels less pressure in the Vegas Golden Knights than he ever did in the Toronto Maple Leafs

Mitch Marner Finds Pavel Dorofeyev With One-Touch Pass For Power-Play Goal

Mitch Marner's first game againts Toronto Maple Leafs in a Las Vegas Golden Knights jersey was packed with feelings, though he was not the only one who wanted to see his name on the scoresheet more. He ended the game with two assists during a power play in a 6–5 overtime victory, and both assists were during the power play. He was even booed by the Toronto fans present in the arena, which was a very peculiar situation to witness on the ice in the city of blessings, and it seemed as if it was a reminder of everything that had been left behind by Marner.One of the things that really came out was that he had none of the hero’s burden. Jack Eichel netted the winner in overtime and had four points in total. Pavel Dorofeyev scored twice, Tomas Hertl got two points, and Mark Stone had one goal and two assists, which made his point streak reach 10 games. Marner was part of the game; however, he was not the one to bring the night noise as he was in Toronto.In Toronto, there was pressure on Marner all the time. After defeats or playoff exits, the questions almost always returned to his production and his contract.That pressure does not exist in Vegas. Marner is currently the Golden Knights’ highest-paid player, yet he is not the only star on the team, and that depth acts like a barrier.Through the participation in 46 matches, Marner is the sixth-best goal scorer of the team with 5 goals. That kind of stat line would’ve caused an uproar in Toronto, especially after signing a massive long-term deal. In Vegas, it hardly registers since the team keeps winning. In fact, Marner was held pointless and finished minus-1 against San Jose last week, and the Golden Knights still won 7–2.Mitch Marner's situation offers a parallel to Phil Kessel's move from Toronto to Pittsburgh; however, the new, reduced role provided greater team success and personal satisfaction. Marner has mainly contributed to the team while being on the power play, where his superior vision has also brought others success. By his standards, it's been a good, not great season, but on this roster, that is more than enough.Marner no longer has to bear the burden of being the franchise's face. He may find the sharing of the spotlight in Vegas to be just what he needs to rediscover his joy in playing and winning, too.Also Read: Trevor Zegras Net Worth Timeline (2016–2026): From career growth to salary, endorsements, and more","Mitch Marner's first game againts Toronto Maple Leafs in a Las Vegas Golden Knights jersey was packed with feelings.

Allen Iverson’s ultimate financial safety net

The divorce settlement bifurcated Iverson’s trust fund



What is Allen Iverson doing now?



In the high-stakes world of NBA contracts, there are flashy max deals, and then there is the absolute masterclass in foresight known as the Allen Iverson Life Line. While he was busy breaking ankles and redefining league culture in the early 2000s, Allen Iverson’s team was quietly securing a financial legacy that would outlast his playing years by decades.It is one of the most legendary financial savings stories in sports history, and as Iverson, but as he inches closer to his mid-50s, it turns out he’s about to execute the greatest fast-break in the history of sports business: a $32 million trust fund courtesy of Reebok.Back in 2001, when Iverson was at his peak with the 2000-01 MVP award, he wrote history as the shortest player (6’0”) ever to win it. The same year, he also signed the ultimate financial safety net with Reebok. Taking into consideration his reputation as a lavish spender, Iverson’s agent and Reebok structured this unique lifetime contract that would support him in his post-league life.The deal included a yearly stipend in which Reebok will pay Iverson $800,000 every year for life. A lump sum trust fund of $32 million was set aside, but Iverson couldn’t touch it until he turned 55 years old. This year, on June 7th, Iverson will turn 51, and after 4 more years, in 2030, he can finally access this money.In a game of fate, Iverson lost his entire trust fund to his wife, Tawana Turner, after violating their postnuptial agreement. But Turner, instead of taking the entire check, decided to leave 50% with Iverson that saved him from financial ruin. When the fund finally matures in 2030, Iverson will likely walk away with $16 million, while the other $16 million goes to his ex-wife.Iverson’s career and life have given him some hard lessons about money. When his financial struggles hit the headlines, the world was shocked because this was the man who once ruled the NBA.In an interview in 2025, AI sat down and talked about how popularity and money had people circling him at one point, but with depleting finances, the circle became smaller and smaller.He said, “Just because you love somebody don't mean they love you the same way,"" he said. ""I made so many mistakes trusting people that you think supposed to love you. I'm not talking about friends that you grew up with … I'm talking about even family. Money is really the root of all evil.""In late 2023, Allen Iverson was appointed as the vice president of basketball in Reebok with Shaquille O’Neal as its president. This move wasn't just ceremonial, it brought Iverson back into the fold to help relaunch the brand's basketball category for the 2025-2026 season. He also published a memoir in 2025, Misunderstood, that dived deep into his upbringing, childhood, basketball, and becoming a cultural icon.Also read: The 21-year old Anthony Black announced himself to Europe with a poster dunk in Berlin","Allen Iverson signed a lifetime contract with Reebok in 2001.
