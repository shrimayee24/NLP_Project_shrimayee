"Paris Olympics: Two in the bag, super Manu Bhaker not done yet",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/paris-olympics-2024/indiaparis/paris-olympics-two-in-the-bag-super-manu-bhaker-not-done-yet/articleshow/112153753.cms,"Shooting star 1st Indian post-1947 to win 2 medals at 1 Olympic

CHATEAUROUX: ""No time to celebrate. My work is unfinished. There's a lot to play for,"" Manu Bhaker had said after winning her first Olympic medal on Sunday. There indeed was a lot more at stake. There was a date with history too. The belief that it was around the corner could be seen in the glint of her eyes, in the clenching of teeth when she smiled.Manu wanted another medal badly and she got it on Tuesday: a second bronze medal, which made her the first Indian after Independence to win two medals at the same Olympic Games.Norman Pritchard , a sprinter born in 1875 in then Calcutta, bagged two silver medals in the 1900 Games, which incidentally was also held in Paris . But that was 124 years ago, lost in the pages of India's Olympic history. While IOC lists him as an Indian, World Athletics credits his medals to Britain.Manu's second bronze came in the company of another 22-year-old, a first-time Olympian - the shy Sarabjot Singh - in 10m air pistol mixed team event.For Manu, it was a reward for believing in herself when she was going through a dark period. It was the karma thing she has been talking about here. ""Do your work - the hard yards - the result will come,"" she again said on Tuesday.The two medals… it is all sinking in, yes, but I must keep my emotions in check. I have one more event left to play,""Manu said. Two in the bag, but she is not done yet. Manu has been shooting well and a third medal one now looks a real possibility. The 25m pistol individual is her pet event.Manu showed her form again in the mixed battle for bronze. She looked composed when she walked in 30 minutes before the competition to set up her station. She did some shadow shooting, took a deep breath and walked out as if lost in thought. When she returned with Sarabjot for the competition, she looked ready. No sign of nerves. Sarabjot's face showed nothing, but he said later that he was feeling the pressure.The South Korean pair consisted of Lee Wanho and women's 10m air pistol individual gold medallist Oh Ye Jin. The way the Indians and the South Koreans shot was an interesting contrast to watch. Manu shot consistently. She had seven consecutive 10s. Sarabjot struggled a bit. Wanho shot like a dream, Jin had a night mare of a time. That made the difference.Manu started well with a 10.2. Sarabjot had a terrible 8.6. India was down 0-2. The winner needed to get to 16 first, which meant eight wins.Manu got 10.7 in the second try and Sarabjot shot a 10.5. The Koreans were way behind this time. 2-2. The Indians then hit a purple patch with both hitting 10s in their third and fourth tries to go up 6-2. Manu again shot a 10.5, Sarabjot managed just 9.6 but Jin's poor form helped. The Indians were up 8-2.That was when Wanho decided to find a rare zone. 10.8! It was 8-4 now. But the Koreans slipped again in the seventh shot and the Indians were cruising at 10-4.Then Manu had her first bad shot - 8.3. The Koreans had reduced the gap to 10-6. From there, it was 12-6 and 14-6. Jin's meltdown was surprising, not pretty to watch. The Indians were not complaining. They needed just two more points.Wanho staged a late comeback. He had not given up. He shot two consecutive 10.8s, which helped the Koreans reduce the gap again - 14-10. The 13th shot sealed the issue. Wanho shot a miserable 9. Manu had a 9.4, but Sarabjot shot 10.2. That was enough.India took two timeouts in between when the pressure seemed to mount. It helped them calm their nerves.Job done, Manu and Sarabjot stood on the stage with the Tricolour wrapped around their shoulders, and posed, as a small contingent of Indian supporters made quite some noise in the stands. It was the fans' time to get trigger happy.While the celebrations were on in the stands, Jaspal Rana was long gone. The medal assured, Manu's coach picked his bag, put on his shades and got up to leave. He accepted a hug and a handshake. ""Salute to you, Jaspal. You gave the girl confidence and courage."" He smiled, struggling to control his emotions and walked away swiftly.",Manu Bhaker becomes first Indian post-1947 to win 2 medals at 1 Olympic Games. Bhaker wins bronze in 10m air pistol mixed team event. She is the first Indian after Independence to win two medals at the same Games. Norman Pritchard won two silver medals in the 1900 Games.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112153728,imgsize-104908,width-400,resizemode-4/112153728.jpg"

NEW DELHI: India pulled off an astonishing victory against Sri Lanka, completing a 3-0 clean sweep, in a nail-biting finish to the third and final T20I of the series in Pallekele.The hosts required just 9 runs off the last two overs with six wickets in hand, but the game took an unexpected turn when captain Suryakumar Yadav handed the ball to Rinku Singh , a player who had never bowled in his 23-match T20I career.On a spin-friendly track, Rinku Singh's entry into the bowling attack was a surprising and risky decision. However, it turned out to be a masterstroke.Rinku's first delivery was a dot ball, with Kusal Perera attempting a reverse-slog but failing to connect. The tension was palpable, and head coach Gautam Gambhir 's reaction of 'oohh' was caught on the telecast, reflecting the high stakes of the moment.The turning point came with Rinku's second ball. He bowled a short-of-a-length delivery that Perera mistimed, resulting in a top edge. Rinku moved swiftly towards the off-side and completed a caught-and-bowled dismissal, taking his maidenT20I wicket .This crucial breakthrough brought a smile to Gambhir's face, a rare sight in such tense circumstances.Rinku's over didn't stop there. On the final delivery, he claimed the wicket of Ramesh Mendis , ending the over with remarkable figures of 2 for 3. His two wickets and three runs conceded drastically altered the equation, leaving Sri Lanka needing six runs off the final over.Suryakumar took it upon himself to bowl the last over. Displaying nerves of steel, he managed to restrict the hosts and push the game into a Super Over. India emerged victorious in the Super Over , securing a thrilling win that will be remembered for Rinku Singh's unexpected heroics and Suryakumar Yadav's bold captaincy.","India beat Sri Lanka in the third and final T20I of the series in Pallekele.

A 'unique' 96-year wait for India's legendary Olympic hockey teams ends in Paris,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/paris-olympics-2024/indiaparis/a-unique-96-year-wait-for-indias-legendary-olympic-hockey-teams-ends-in-paris/articleshow/112151165.cms,"""Sone pe suhaga""

NEW DELHI: In 1928, Indian hockey embarked on a journey that got written and rewritten in 'golden' words, where the team won medals for 10 Olympics in a row. The 44-year run of consecutive podium finishes included a period of 28 years that saw a couple of World Wars, India getting independence and six Olympic editions where the hockey team won six successive gold medals without losing a match.At the 1952 Helsinki Games, wrestler KD Jadhav won India's first post-independence individual medal, a bronze.It was the first occasion when the hockey team's medal had company. But what hockey kept waiting for, since winning its first medal on 26th May 1928, was an Indian 'team' from another sport to join it as an Olympic medal winner.That wait ended after 96 years on July 30th 2024, at the Paris Games when the shooting duo of Manu Bhaker and Sarabjot Singh became the first Indian 'team' apart from hockey to win an Olympic medal.is how hockey legend and three-time Olympic medallist Harbinder Singh reacted in surprise when Timesofindia.com reached out to him over the phone for his reaction on the unique parallel of Manu and Sarabjot's bronze-medal win. The Indians defeated their South Korean opponents, Oh Ye Jin and Wonho Lee, 16-10 on Tuesday in the third-place playoff in the10m air pistol mixed team event.It was Manu's second medal of the Games, after she opened India's account in Paris with a bronze in the women's 10m air pistol individual event.""These two young kids have done well. Good for hockey to have company now with another team, as you pointed out. It never struck me,"" he added.""It still gives me goosebumps when I think of winning the gold medal by beating Pakistan in the (Tokyo) 1964 final, after we had lost to them in the final of the (Rome) 1960 Olympics,"" Harbinder recalled. ""I remember we landed at the Palam airport in Delhi and the entire airport was packed with fans who had come to welcome us.""Talking about similarities to hockey's 96-year wait for an Indian 'team' from another sport to win an Olympic medal, it took 44 years after KD Jadhav's 1952 bronze to have another individual Olympic medal winner from India. Tennis legend Leander Paes ended that wait with his men's singles bronze at Atlanta 1996.It took India 100 years to have a woman win an Olympic medal, a historic feat achieved by weightlifter Karnam Malleswari, who won a bronze at the Sydney Olympics in 2000. She waited 12 years for company in the form of badminton great Saina Nehwal and boxing legend Mary Kom as the next women Olympic medal winners from India. Both won bronze medals at the 2012 London Games.Rifle shooter Abhinav Bindra 's individual gold at Beijing in 2008 was India's first in 108 years of the country's Olympic history at that time. He was joined by javelin-thrower Neeraj Chopra 13 years later with his gold in Tokyo.Hockey had to wait for 41 years, after its 1980 Moscow gold, to return to the Olympic podium. The bronze at the Tokyo Games in 2021 broke that jinx.Neeraj's javelin gold in Tokyo three years ago remains India's first athletics medal post independence. British-Indian runner Norman Pritchard won two silver medals, which are also credited to India, at the 1900 Paris Games.Pritchard's medals waited the longest, 121 years, for the company.",Manu Bhaker and Sarabjot Singh are the first Indian 'team' apart from hockey to win an Olympic medal. The shooting duo won bronze in the 10m air pistol mixed team event in Paris. Hockey legend Harbinder Singh says it is good for hockey to have company.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112151137,imgsize-53716,width-400,resizemode-4/112151137.jpg"

He immediately turned to face the fan, displaying a displeased expression.Virat landed in Sri Lanka on Monday morning for the three-match ODI series against the host nation.Due to rain in Colombo, the initial practice session was called off. Nevertheless, Virat participated in his first net session since the conclusion of the T20 World Cup.With the 2025 Champions Trophy just seven months away, Virat will be expected to give his all and showcase his best performance to aim for another ICC trophy.Virat, who has announced his retirement from T20Is following India's triumph in the T20 World Cup, has played 53 ODIs against Sri Lanka, amassing 2594 runs at an impressive average of 63.26, which includes 10 centuries and 12 half-centuries.","Virat Kohli was noticeably irritated when a fan addressed him as "" Chokli "" while he was practicing with his teammates in a room in Sri Lanka.

Lakshya Sen on the mark in Paris Olympics,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/paris-olympics-2024/indiaparis/lakshya-sen-on-the-mark-in-paris-olympics/articleshow/112182402.cms,"Indian shuttler beats No. 3 seed, to face Prannoy in pre-quarters; Sindhu wins too

PRANNOY RALLIES TO MAKE PRE-QUARTERS

PARIS: After the early morning rain, the light, moist breeze felt good on the face. A good night's sleep following the long train journey from Chateauroux on Tuesday night had helped. Coming out of the Metro, just outside the Porte de la Chapelle, one noticed that the cobbled sidewalk leading to the stadium had impressions of a shuttlecock.And a little ahead, a barbell, which reminded one of Mirabai Chanu . But that is for another day. Wednesday morning was about our badminton stars, in the fight for knockout last-16 singles berths.PV Sindhu , two Olympic medals in her bag (silver in Rio 2016, bronze in Tokyo 2020), was the first Indian out on the courts. The 29-year-old Indian was up against 27-year-old Kristin Kuuba of Estonia.The first game was a breeze as she took it 21-15. Kuuba, who has a deceptive drop in her repertoire, managed to stay close till 6-8 in the second game. But Sindhu had a quick word with her Indonesian coach Agus Dwi Santoso during the time-out. She returned to score 11 points on the trot and then sealed the game and match at 21-10. It also confirmed her entry in the last-16 knockout stage.While it was easy for Sindhu and was on expected lines, it was a huge task for Lakshya Sen in the men's singles. Having beaten Kevin Cordon of Guatemala in his opening game, he got the better of Julien Carraggi of Belgium. With Cordon pulling out after his first match, Lakshya's win against him was 'deleted'.So, in the must win encounter, the 22-year-old unseeded Indian was up against the third seed, Jonatan Christie of Indonesia. Sen took his time to settle in, staged a comeback and then blew the Indonesian and the seedings and rankings out of the window with his emphatic performance.Sen was beating the best in the world not so long ago but suffered a slump last year. He had to undergo a nose surgery for a deviated septum last August. The surgery was needed because the septum had blocked his right nasal pathway. He revealed later that the air intake was just 20% of normal. It had led to low immunity and several illnesses. It took him eight months to fully recover and rediscover his form, fitness and his confidence.Sen had beaten Christie the first time they met in 2020. After that it was 4-0 in favour of the Indonesian. But that would have been far from the Indian's mind. He had got a tough draw, and he was willing to come out of it fighting.Sen started tentatively and found himself down 0-5. The Indonesian was pinning him to the back of the court and attacked him aggressively. ""It took me some time to understand his tactics. The wind was also not helping, so I decided to change my strategy and counter his aggression,"" Sen said later.From 2-8 down, he took seven straight points to go ahead 9-8. Sen decided to engage in rallies and came up with delicate drops and scintillating returns. Christie kept smashing, hitting hard, trying to barge his way through. Sen was unperturbed and stonewalled his fancied opponent.The Indian then came up with his own smashes and went ahead 14-11. Christie fought back to make it 18-18. Sen picked two quick points to get the game point. Then came a brilliant, reflex return from the Indian. It was the shot of the match and one which gave Sen the confidence to go for the kill. The first game was clinched 21-18.Sen did not change his strategy in the second game. He was willing to play long rallies, keep returning everything that was thrown at him, keep lunging, keep diving. The Indonesian kept making unforced errors, rattled by Sen's stubborn play that had blunted his game.At the halfway stage of the second game, Sen led 11-6, Then, leading 13-9, he reeled off four points to go ahead 17-9. It was clear by then that the Indonesian had no chance of making a dramatic comeback. Sen had a stranglehold on him, the escape window was shut.The Indian sealed the game at 21-12 and clenched his fist one last time. He then waved at the fans in the stands and thanked them with folded hands.""I took time to settle down in the first game and after that tried to stay one or two points in the lead. It worked. In the second, I was in full control,"" Sen said later. ""It was a tough group. Going ahead I have confidence and the momentum with me. I must keep giving my 100 %.""He must. It is a long haul.HS Prannoy lost the first game of his match against Le Duc Phat of Vietnam but he fought back strongly to make the round of 16. Prannoy won 16-21, 21-11, 21-12 and will take on Lakshya for a place in the quarters.","Lakshya Sen beats No. 3 seed, to face Prannoy in pre-quarters. Sindhu wins too, beating Estonia's Kristin Kuuba 21-15. Sen will now face the world No. 1 in the last-16.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112182382,imgsize-50300,width-400,resizemode-4/112182382.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Millions of Indian fans were left heartbroken when MS Dhoni was run out against New Zealand in the 2019 ODI World Cup semifinal at Old Trafford, Manchester on July 10.Chasing a 240-run target, India were 209/7 after 48 overs and had just lost Ravindra Jadeja who had played arguably his best ODI innings - a 59-ball 77-run knock that was studded with 4 sixes and 4 fours.Needing 31 runs off the last 12 balls, India still had the 'best finisher in the world' at the crease and still hopeful of victory.Lockie Ferguson bowled the penultimate over of the match and Dhoni hit the first ball of the over for a six over deep backward point. The second delivery was a got ball.It was the third ball of the over when hearts of millions of Indian fans skipped a beat as ironically, for a man who is so good between the wickets, was run out, in what turned to be his last ODI.Ferguson bowled a slower ball on a length and it popped up off the glove towards short fine leg as Dhoni got cramped on the pull.With Bhuvneshwar Kumar at the other end, Dhoni ran for two but there was a slight stutter on the second run and that cost Dhoni as he was just short of a direct hit at the keeper's end by Martin Guptill.Dhoni was run out after a 50-run knock that came off 72 balls and India lost the match by 18 runs and were eliminated from the World Cup.Now a video has surfaced online in which during an event, Dhoni is asked by a fan about that moment and how she dealt with it.Dhoni replies, ""It was a difficult one because I knew that this will be my last World Cup, so it would have been good to be on the winning side. It was heartbreak moment, so we accepted the result and we tried to move on.(It takes time and one gets some time after the World Cup. I haven't played any international after that, so I got a lot of time). So, yes, it was a heartbreak but at the same time you have to get out of it. So you just accept that you tried your best, but you were not able to win it.""Mahendra Singh Dhoni is widely regarded as one of the greatest captains and wicket-keeper batsmen in the history of the game. Dhoni became the captain of the Indian cricket team in 2007.Under his leadership, India won several major ICC tournaments, including the ICC T20 World Cup in 2007, the ICC Cricket World Cup in 2011, and the ICC Champions Trophy in 2013.Dhoni announced his retirement from Test cricket in December 2014.

The scenes from India's training session at the R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo on Wednesday have been received by fans and the cricket fraternity as reassurance that former captain Virat Kohli and the Indian team's new head coach Gautam Gambhir have moved on from their past difference to achieve a common goal -- the success of Team India.Kohli, who arrived in Sri Lanka as part of India's ODI squad ahead of the three-match series, was seen having a long chat with Gambhir; and the laughter shared by the two conveyed that the former teammates have buried the hatchet and are comfortable in their reunion in new roles.The pictures were widely shared on social media, including by the Indian Premier League franchise Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) that Kohli represents and even the International Cricket Council.In a cheeky caption for the image where both Kohli and Gambhir are seen laughing, the RCB's post on 'X' read: Our seasoned right-arm quick convincing the gaffer to give him the new ball.""The Rajasthan Royals also couldn't stop themselves from sharing and reacting to the images of bonhomie between Kohli and Gambhir, both of who were part of India's 2011 ODI World Cup triumph.The RR post read: ""Can't unsee it"".The International Cricket Council also joined in via Instagram and captioned the image of Gambhir cracking up as: ""Why is Gautam Gambhir going"" followed by a laughing emoji.Like Kohli, Rohit Sharma has also returned from a well-deserved rest, as both had announced their retirement from the T20Is following India's T20 World Cup triumph last month. The tournament also marked the end of Dravid's tenure as India's head coach.Interestingly, after initial reports of Rohit and Kohli not likely to play the ODIs in Sri Lanka, the new head coach Gambhir had urged the seniors to make themselves available for the three-match series, after which both were named in the squad.Before the ODIs, the Suryakumar Yadav-led Indian team defeated Sri Lanka 3-0 in the T20Is. Surya was named India's T20I captain after the T20 World Cup.","Virat Kohli and Gautam Gambhir seen laughing during India's training session in Sri Lanka.

But the third T20I against Sri Lanka saw the Indian captain for the series rolling his arm over and taking the match into a Super Over at Pallekele on Tuesday.Sri Lanka had bowled well to restrict India to 137/9. The hosts were 129/4, needing 9 runs off the last 2 overs when Suryakumar Yadav brought Rinku Singh in the attack.Rinku did a superb job as he conceded just 3 runs and took 2 wickets off the penultimate over, leaving Sri Lanka to get 6 runs off the last over with two new batters at the crease.Due to India's slow over-rate, only four fielders were allowed outside the 30-yard circle and Mohammed Siraj was ready to bowl the last over but SKY made a last minute change and brought himself on to bowl his right-arm off-breaks.After bowling a dot ball, Surya took his maiden T20I wicket when he had Kamindu Mendis caught by Rinku Singh on the second delivery of the over. Surya bowled a slower delivery at 86kph, Mendis went for a reverse-slog but got it off the bottom part of the bat and the ball landed straight into the hands of Rinku Singh at third man.Suryakumar Yadav then had Maheesh Theekshana caught by Sanju Samson down the leg side for a first ball duck. India went for the review and the replays showed that the ball brushed the glove and the same was confirmed by UltraEdge.Asitha Fernando took one run off the hat-trick ball to bring down the equation to 5 runs needed off 2 balls.Chamindu Wickramasinghe took 2 runs off the penultimate ball of the over to bring down the equation to 3 runs needed off 1 ball. The throw from long-off came to the bowler's end and had SKY broken the stumps at his end, Asitha Fernando would have been run out, but he threw the ball to the keeper where Wickramasinghe had made his ground.Wickramasinghe again took 2 runs off the last ball and again the throw from long-on came to the bowler's end. This time Suryakumar couldn't gather it cleanly and Fernando reached the crease with a dive as the match went into a Super Over.The official broadcaster shared a clip of Suryakumar Yadav's over that turned the match on its head.This was the only over that Suryakumar Yadav bowled in the match and it turned out to be a sensational one.","Suryakumar Yadav takes maiden T20I wicket with hat-trick.

"Norman Pritchard: Before Manu Bhaker: Remembering Norman Pritchard, the first ‘Indian’ to win two medals in single Olympic games",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/paris-olympics-2024/before-manu-bhaker-remembering-norman-pritchard-the-first-indian-to-win-two-medals-in-single-olympics-games/articleshow/112135371.cms,"Who was Norman Pritchard ?

Calcutta Boy

Football Hero

Hollywood Calling

Manu Bhaker made history as the first Indian athlete , post Independence, to win two medals in the same Olympic Games by securing a bronze medal in the 10m air pistol mixed team event with Sarabjot Singh. Two days earlier, she had claimed India's first medal at the Paris Olympics , becoming the first Indian female shooter to win an Olympic medal.Before that there was another ‘Indian’ who managed that task, even though the history records have a minor quibble over whether he qualified as British or Indian.What is not in dispute is that he won two silver medals at the Paris Games 1900, the same venue where Bhaker made history. He was also the first person to score a hat-trick in an official football match on Indian soil and also the first Olympian to become a star in ‘silent’ Hollywood. And he did it in Paris as well. Of course, pedantic folks could argue that Bhaker won her second medal in a mixed team event while Pritchard won his medals in individual events.Pritchard’s nationality also remained a prickly affair. In 2000, British Olympic historian, the late Ian Buchanan, had claimed that the silver medals Pritchard won (in 200m and 200m hurdles) should be awarded to Great Britain. While it’s true that Pritchard was chosen to represent Great Britain after competing in the British AAA championship, the International Olympic Committee credits India for the medals.Norman Pritchard, born on June 23, 1875, in Calcutta (now Kolkata), India, holds a unique place in the annals of Olympic history . He was the first Indian and Asian-born athlete to win an Olympic medal, achieving this feat at the 1900 Paris Olympics. He was also the first person to score a hat-trick in a professional football game, a founding member of the Indian Football Association and later the first Olympian to participate inPritchard was the son of George Petersen Pritchard, an Englishman who managed a family business in India. He grew up in a well-to-do family, which provided him access to excellent education and opportunities in sports. His athletic talents were nurtured at St. Xavier's College in Calcutta, where he excelled in sprinting and hurdling, quickly gaining recognition in regional athletic meets. His speed and agility were unparalleled at the time, setting the stage for his future successes.In 1900, Pritchard travelled to Paris to compete in the Summer Olympics, a groundbreaking moment as he became the first athlete from India to participate in the Olympics. He competed in the 200 meters, 200 meters hurdles, and 110 meters hurdles. His performance was outstanding; he won silver medals in both the 200 meters and 200 meters hurdles, marking the first time an athlete from India had won Olympic medals. In the 200 meters hurdles, Pritchard set a then Olympic record of 26.8 seconds in the semi-finals, and in the final, he clocked 26 seconds to win silver, behind USA’s Alvin Kraenzlein, who set a new Olympic record.Beyond his Olympic feats, Pritchard also had a notable football career. He is credited with scoring the first hat-trick in an open football tournament in India while playing for St. Xavier's College against Sovabazar in July 1897. He served as the Secretary of the Indian Football Association from 1900 to 1902, contributing significantly to the development of the sport in India.After his Olympic success, Pritchard moved to England and later to the United States, where he transitioned into a career in the entertainment industry. Even how he transitioned to Hollywood is a remarkable story.In December 1906, during a dinner in London, Norman Pritchard was asked to recount the grandeur of the 1899 durbar in Delhi, held to welcome Lord Curzon as the Viceroy of India. His vivid and dramatic description was so compelling that Sir Charles Wyndham, a prominent figure in theatre, mistook him for an actor and invited him to play a minor role in ""The Stronger Sex"" at the Apollo Theatre in 1907.Pritchard's performance was successful, prompting Sir Charles to encourage him to pursue acting seriously. Pritchard made his Broadway debut in the United States with ""The Elder Son"" at the Playhouse Theatre on September 15, 1914. In 1919, he played a significant role in a strike action at the Schubert Theater in Washington, leading a boycott as a member of the trade union, The Equity, to demand better wages for actors.Adopting the stage name Norman Trevor, he found a niche in Hollywood as a character actor. He appeared in numerous films and Broadway productions, gaining moderate success. His Broadway debut came with ""The Elder Son"" at the Playhouse Theatre in 1914. He went on to act in 26 plays and 27 movies, making his big screen debut in silent movies with ""After Dark"" in 1915 and ending with ""Tonight at Twelve,"" released in 1929, the year of his death.Pritchard passed away on October 31, 1929, in Norwalk, California, under tragic circumstances. His obituary stated that he died of a ""brain malady,"" and it is now speculated that he may have been suffering from Alzheimer's disease. Despite his relatively early death, his legacy endures, particularly in India, where he is celebrated as a pioneer in athletics. His accomplishments paved the way for future generations of Indian athletes, inspiring them to compete on the world stage.","Norman Pritchard was the first Indian and Asian-born athlete to win an Olympic medal, achieving this feat at the 1900 Paris Olympics.

While Suryakumar bowled the 20th over, defending six runs successfully by taking two wickets in his first two balls, Rinku Singh, in a pressure-filled 19th over, bagged two crucial wickets, including that of Kusal Perera, when Sri Lanka needed just nine runs from 12 balls.The two incredible overs from Rinku and Surya stopped the Lankans on 137, taking the game into the Super Over.The Super Over tehn saw Washington Sundar shine, giving away only two runs and taking two wickets.Suryakumar then sealed the win with a sweeping shot on the first ball he faced in the Super Over.No amount of credit is enough for the new India leader Suya, who came into the bowl in the 20th over with six runs to defend and got two wickets in his first two balls.Rinku, bowling for the first time in T20Is, was critical in removing Perera, who scored 46 runs.The Rinku strike came just when Sri Lanka appeared to have the match secured.India were reeling after Khaleel Ahmed's expensive 18th over containing six wides, but Rinku and Suryakumar brought the game back to life.Earlier, when Kusal Mendis (43), Pathum Nissanka (26), and Perera (46) were in cruise control mode with stands of 58 and 52 for the first and second wicket stands, the story looked different. However, just like winning, losing is also a habit and the Islanders have caught that bad bug.For Suryakumar, the series turned out to be a dream affair and he contributed significantly to India's success.His strategic move of introducing Rinku in the 19th over also brought a wide grin on head coach Gautam Gambhir's face.Sri Lankan spinners effectively restrained the Indian batters on a pitch offering significant turn and variable bounce. Despite losing early wickets, India managed to post 137 for 9, with Shubman Gill (39 off 37 balls) and Riyan Parag (26 off 18 balls) stitching a 54-run partnership for the sixth wicket after being down at 48 for 5.Prior to the partnership, India struggled with their shot selection, resulting in the dismissal of key players.Sanju Samson scored his second consecutive duck, getting out to a desperate slog off debutant Chamindu Wickramasinghe.Rinku, struggling to replicate his success from the first season, suffered a momentary lapse, leading to his dismissal. Suryakumar also failed to capitalize, while Shivam Dube couldn't effectively tackle the deliveries that moved away from him.Despite the challenges, Gill adjusted his play style, curbing his natural attacking instincts, and Parag showcased his potential with explosive shots. Highlights of their partnership included Gill's inside-out boundary over covers and Parag's back-to-back sixes off Wanindu Hasaranga.Both, however, fell attempting glory shots.Sri Lanka, meanwhile, missed the services of their premier pacer Matheesha Pathirana due to a shoulder injury.Skipper Charith Asalanka effectively used their four-pronged spin attack, maintaining pressure on Indian batsmen and taking wickets at regular intervals.",India beat Sri Lanka by seven wickets in third and final T20I in Pallekele.

With a total of 20.5, the Koreans won the first round and took a 2-0 lead.The team with the most points—16—wins the medal in mixed team competitions.At a deficit of 0–2, Bhaker's reliability was evident, and Sarabjot benefited from it as they won the following four games to increase their lead to 8–2.Bhaker was so confident that during the entire 13-round competition, she only had three shots below ten.The Koreans faced an uphill battle as they gave in to pressure and lost 16–10, unable to equal their opponents.At 13 years of age, Sarabjot harboured hopes of becoming a footballer but while studying at Ambala's Bhagirath Public School, he saw a few kids wielding air guns at a makeshift range during a summer camp and went to his father and told him that he wants to pursue shooting.That was 2014. Sarbjot's father Jitender Singh , a farmer, told his son that the sport is pretty expensive. But eventually, after Sarabjot insisted for months, he agreed.It's a decision that the family will never repent, especially after what Sarabjot has achieved in the international circuit.Sarabjot has already won a senior ISSF World Cup gold in 10m air pistol.In the domestic circuit, his precision and calmness has made him the national champion twice.As of now, Sarabjot has won 2 World Championships gold medals, 3 World Cup gold medals, 1 ISSF Junior World Cup gold, 1 gold and 2 silver medals in ISSF Junior Cup and 2 gold medals, a sliver and a bronze in the Asian Championships.Sarabjot has always credited his coach Abhishek Rana for making a champion out of him.","Sarabjot Singh won India's second medal with Manu Bhaker at Paris Olympics.

MUMBAI: As expected, there was plenty of discussion on player retentions in the 10 IPL owners ’ meeting with BCCI’s top officials at the BCCI headquarters on Wednesday evening, with some franchises even questioning the need for a mega auction later this year, but no consensus was achieved in the nearly four-hour long meeting.BCCI secretary Jay Shah told TOI: “We’ve discussed everything.We’ll make all the decisions in a week's time.”Summing up the difference of views regarding major IPL issues between the team owners perfectly, Delhi Capitals co-owner Parth Jindal told the reporters, ""We are not on the same page on many issues. I think the BCCI, in their wisdom, will decide (on retentions). The (BCCI) president and secretary will decide. Hopefully, by the end of August, we will get to know the rules for the next cycle.""Asked on whether there was a debate in the meeting on whether there should not be a mega auction at all- a few of the bigger franchises suggested that going for a mini-auction was the better option, Jindal said, ""There was, and I was surprised. Some people said that there shouldn't be a mega auction at all. There should be only smaller auctions. I'm not in that camp. I feel that it evens out the playing field, and it makes the IPL a level playing field and makes the IPL what it is. It makes it competitive, an even playing field. That's why.""Stressing that there was ""no consensus"" on the number of retentions a franchise should be allowed, Delhi Capitals co-owner Parth Jindal revealed: ""Some people want 8-10, some people want four. It's all up in the air.""Meanwhile, there was no consensus between the franchises on the controversial Impact Player rule too. Jindal said he wasn’t in favour of the rule, which allows for an extra batter or bowler during the match. ""Again, different views. Some people want it because it gives a chance to young players to play in the IPL. Some people don't want it because it's detrimental to Indian cricket in terms of the development of allrounders. So, it's a mixed bag. I'm in the second camp. I don't want it. I want the game as it is: 11 vs 11. I think that the allrounders are very important, and you have different players who don't bowl in the IPL or don't bat in the IPL, which is not good for Indian cricket.""In a statement on the meeting, Shah said: “The BCCI on Wednesday organized a constructive dialogue with the owners of the 10 franchises on various subjects pertaining to the upcoming season of the IPL. The franchise owners tabled feedback on player regulations and other commercial aspects, including central merchandising, licensing, and gaming.“The BCCI will now take these recommendations to the IPL Governing Council for further deliberation and evaluation before formulating the IPL player regulations.”It’s clear that some of the bigger teams are not in favour of having a mega auction at all, but instead have a mini auction as they want to retain as many of their top players as possible. ""There were conversations on whether to have a gig or a small auction. It comes down to how many players each team wants and it looks like at the moment, the franchises want to retain as many players as they can, because they have invested heavily in them,"" a reliable source told this paper.If there's no mega auction, the teams might be allowed to use the Right-to-Match cards to give them an opportunity to retain their top players. Something will have to be worked out for players who are on lower salaries,” a source told this paper.According to a source, at one point, there was intense debate between Kolkata Knight Riders' Shah Rukh Khan and Punjab Kings' co-owner Shah Rukh Khan on an issue, but Wadia shot down any controversy by saying that it was just a “normal discussion,” and not a “heated debate” as was being reported by various websites.While Mumbai Indians owner Akash Ambani joined the meeting virtually, among the owners who turned up at meeting were Kolkata Knight Riders co-owner Shah Rukh Khan, Kiran Kumar Grandhi of Delhi Capitals, Sanjiv Goenka of Lucknow Super Giants, Rupa Gurunath of Chennai Super Kings, Kavya Maran of SunRisers Hyderabad and Manoj Badale of Rajasthan Royals.",There was plenty of discussion on player retentions in the 10 IPL owners’ meeting with BCCI’s top officials.

He later took up the role of coach for the Indian national team, achieving notable successes. Under his coaching, the Indian team finished as runners-up in the 2000 ICC Champions Trophy.Gaekwad's significant moments as a coach include victories in Sharjah in 1998 and the Test match at Ferozeshah Kotla in 1999, where Anil Kumble took all 10 wickets in an innings against Pakistan.Prime Minister Narendra Modi was one of the first to extend his condolences.BCCI Secretary Jay Shah also paid tribute to the late cricketer.A determined opening batter, he was renowned for his tenacious defense and distinctively high back lift. Between 1974 and 1984, he often found himself in a competitive tussle with Chetan Chauhan for the role of the second opener alongside Sunil Gavaskar in the Indian team.Known for his affable personality, he famously scored a double century against Imran Khan's Pakistan in Jalandhar - a knock that was one of the slowest double hundreds of its time.A bespectacled opener, Gaekwad's finest moment came during the 1976 series at Sabina Park in Jamaica, where he faced a young Michael Holding and Wayne Daniel. Holding's beamer struck him on the ear, leaving him bloodied, while local fans, perched on tree tops, shouted ""Kill him, man... Kill him, Mikey,"" a scene that Sunil Gavaskar later described as barbaric.Gaekwad went on to coach the Indian team between 1998 and 1999, during which Anil Kumble achieved his historic 10-wicket haul at Kotla. It was also under his guidance that a young Harbhajan Singh made his Test debut, with Harbhajan always speaking highly of 'Angshu sir' for his dignified demeanor.Beyond his playing and coaching career, Gaekwad served as a national selector, headed the Baroda Cricket Association, and was a BCCI Apex Council member representing the ICA until he fell ill.Cricket legends like Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev, Ravi Shastri, Clive Lloyd, Andy Roberts, Farokh Engineer, Dilip Vengsarkar, BCCI president Roger Binny, Mohinder Amarnath, Sandeep Patil, Karsan Ghavri, Balwinder Singh Sandhu, and actor Nana Patekar all offered encouraging words to uplift Gaekwad's spirits before his passing.",Former India cricketer Anshuman Gaekwad passes away at the age of 71.

Will support national team by developing players at Inter Kashi: Habas,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/will-support-national-team-by-developing-players-at-inter-kashi-habas/articleshow/112029904.cms,"Last season, Habas guided Mohun Bagan Super Giant to the ISL Shield triumph

Panaji:

Antonio Lopez Habas was close to becoming the national team coach until he was pipped at the post by FC Goa ’s Manolo Marquez , who will now do a dual job of coaching club and country.Habas remains the most successful coach in the Indian Super League (ISL), the top-tier league in the country, and believed he had more than a decent chance of stepping into the boots of Igor Stimac, sacked last month for his failure to steer India to the third round of the FIFA World Cup 2026 qualifiers.“I think I deserved the nomination (to coach the national team),” Habas told TOI after completing a surprise move to Inter Kashi in the I-League , Indian football’s second tier, on Thursday. “We won three (ISL) titles, played four finals and six semifinals. Within football (fraternity), I feel like another Indian. I have coached many players of the national team. I was not chosen, and I accept it. I will support the national team by developing players at Inter Kashi. It’s what I have done until now, and what I will continue to do.”Last season, Habas guided Mohun Bagan Super Giant to the ISL Shield triumph. But while title victories normally assure coaches of a contract extension, the experienced Spaniard was not considered, reportedly due to concerns over his health. Even while selecting the national coach, the All India Football Federation (AIFF) executive committee members made a mention of the 67-year-old’s age and health.Habas though said he has the same “strength and enthusiasm” as when he first arrived in India to take charge of Atletico de Kolkata and won the maiden ISL trophy in 2014.“I am very disappointed and saddened by the treatment that some journalists and others have given me, speaking about my health problems. Someone did it to justify my departure from Mohun Bagan, and at the same time, prevent me from training the national team. My medical tests are currently perfect,” said Habas.The serial trophy winner has won the ISL twice with ATK (2014, 2019-20) and the ISL Winner’s Shield with Mohun Bagan last season. Now, his focus is on ensuring that Inter Kashi – started last season – win the I-League and move to the ISL.Explaining his decision to take over Inter Kashi, Habas said the club’s “proposal is attractive, serious and ambitious.”“It offers me guarantees and seriousness to develop my work,” he said. “At the same time, it is a great responsibility to be able to have a great impact sportingly in such an important and fascinating region of India as Uttar Pradesh.”Besides winning trophies in India, Habas had a stint as Bolivia’s head coach and finished runner-up in the 1997 Copa America.Inter Kashi said Habas will spearhead a long-term project aimed at creating a sustainable football ecosystem in Uttar Pradesh. “This initiative will focus on the promotion of Inter Kashi to the ISL, ensuring the club competes at the highest level of Indian football.“Habas will also help Inter Kashi devise a concrete player pathway to Europe, collaborating with Inter Escaldes to establish a pathway for Indian players to gain opportunities in Andorra, providing them with invaluable international exposure and experience,” the club said in a statement on Thursday.","Antonio Lopez Habas was close to becoming the national team coach until he was pipped at the post by FC Goa’s Manolo Marquez.
