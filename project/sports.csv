NEW DELHI: After Congress dissociated itself from Mani Shankar Aiyar following his prediction that the rival Left front will win in Kerala elections, the veteran hit back on Monday saying he remains with the party even as 'friends of Rahul Gandhi' have left for other parties.The issue flared up on Sunday when Aiyar, attending a function organised by Kerala govt, said Vijayan will return to power. Taking up cudgels on behalf of the Left, Aiyar had said in Thiruvananthapuram, ""As a Congressman, I want UDF to win. As a Gandhian, I am obliged to tell the truth, irrespective of what I wish. I am not a voter in Kerala, but I think he (Kerala's chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan ) is going to get another term.""A stung Congress dissociated itself from Aiyar, with spokesman Pawan Khera saying Aiyar has been writing and speaking in personal capacity for past few years, and Khera's post on X was corroborated by Jairam Ramesh.A day later, Aiyar got back with a bitter attack on Congress. ""The Nehru-Gandhi family is built into the DNA of every Congressman. Why should anyone be in Congress when all of Rahul Gandhi's friends have departed for other shores. It's only because if you don't believe in the leadership of the Nehru-Gandhi family, you would not be in Congress,"" he said, adding, ""I am in Congress, I have not left it. If Pawan Khera is going to expel me, I will happily go outside and kick his backside.Interestingly, Aiyar also made remarks like ""I am Rajivian (Rajiv Gandhi), not Rahulian (Rahul Gandhi)"", and that he does not need Congress, as it does not need him. Besides, he also criticised other Congress members at the national level and in Kerala.Aiyar has been a thorn in the flesh for Congress, with his remarks on politicians and politics having embarrassed Congress many times. His barb at PM Narendra Modi ahead of 2017 Gujarat assembly elections had resulted in Congress suspending him in Dec 2017, but the suspension was revoked in Aug 2018.It is not clear if Congress will again act against Aiyar.

Long before Photoshop, there was Jyoti Bhatt. The year was 1971. India’s premier art institution, the Lalit Kala Akademi, did not yet recognise photography as a fine art category. Artists who worked with the camera were routinely sidelined from its annual exhibitions, their prints placed outside the ranks of painting, sculpture and graphic art. Yet Bhatt — a painter freshly returned to Gujarat after studying graphic printmaking at the Pratt Institute in the US — was determined to break that boundary.Familiar with darkroom techniques such as over-printing, masking using stencils, pushing contrast, cropping and enlarging, he submitted The Face — an image of a human head with a peacock inside it — shot with a camera. “Instead of using the word ‘photography’, I said ‘silver gelatin print’ under medium,"" recalls the 92-year-old. ""The jury of experts had no idea what silver gelatin print meant and accepted my entry. ”Five decades on, this iconic subversion is among a rare group of Bhatt’s experimental black-and-white silver gelatin works now on view in Mumbai. Inaugurated during the ongoing Mumbai Gallery Weekend 2026, A Painter with a Camera: Jyoti Bhatt at Subcontinent Gallery in Fort — on view till February 21, 2026 — foregrounds photography as a central and experimental dimension of Bhatt’s practice.The title pays homage to Painters with a Camera (1968–69), the landmark group exhibition at Jehangir Art Gallery that asserted photography’s credibility when it was still largely excluded from institutional spaces. The works span the 1960s to the 1980s, fractured through mirrors, lenses and multiple exposure, alongside collage and hand-painted images.“In many ways, he has pioneered the medium for younger generations of artists in the country. Even in his 90s, he remains deeply engaged,” says Keshav Mahendru, co-founder of Subcontinent.Born in Bhavnagar in 1934, Bhatt — painter, printmaker, photographer and educator at the Faculty of Fine Arts, Maharaja Sayajirao University, Baroda — has been a defining figure in Indian modern art since the 1950s. In 1956 he emerged as part of the Baroda Group of Artists, joined MSU as a lecturer in 1959, and went on to study at the Accademia di Belle Arti in Naples and the Pratt Institute under Fulbright and Rockefeller grants.A restless experimenter, Bhatt’s work moved from Cubism to Pop before arriving at a language shaped by Indian folk and tribal forms. While he worked in watercolours and oils, it was printmaking that brought him wide recognition. By the early 1960s, photography entered his life — initially as documentation of India’s traditional and folk craft practices — before becoming a lifelong artistic pursuit. “My camera recorded the images around me as my eyes saw them. Manipulation of photographic images, inside or outside my darkroom, shaped what was seen into what was felt,” he says.One image on the gallery’s social media shows a young Bhatt in black and white, two glasses — one perched on his forehead — with multiple cameras slung around his neck. “Apart from a bird’s-eye view and a fish-eye view, there’s the photographer’s eye view,” he says. His helper once found a Nikon lens cap left behind by photographer Kishor Parekh. “Now I have the cap. The only missing part is what’s behind the lens,” joked Bhatt to his friend Bhupendra Karia — who soon sent him a Nikon camera from abroad. “Without the cap,” Bhatt laughs, adding that the glasses, exposure meters and the cameras were all borrowed or lent similarly.Bhatt’s work is held in major public collections including the Smithsonian Institution, Washington DC; The Museum of Modern Art, New York; and the Museum of Art & Photography (MAP), Bengaluru. “While Bhatt has long been championed for his contributions to ethnographic photography, his experimental photographic practice is yet to receive the sustained critical attention it deserves,” says Dhwani Gudka, co-founder of Subcontinent. “Jyoti Bhatt’s work as an experimental photographer is foundational yet under-exhibited and this is our attempt to help change that.”The selection grew out of “long conversations and time spent closely with the photographs themselves,” Gudka explains. When the gallerists visited Bhatt in Gujarat, they found him a generous host — joking easily, making visitors feel instantly special. “He surrounds himself with art — some his and Jyotsna ben’s, but mostly by friends, mentors and former students,” she says. “We were interested in his image-making process where he treats the image like a surface to think through, revise and transform. ” Mahendru points to Baroda (1983): two photographs of MSU students fused through multiple exposure, their faces overlaid with drifting twigs and branches.For younger artists, Bhatt’s practice is a reminder that photography is a medium for thinking, not merely capturing. Gudka highlights a 1977 triad of photographs of Jyotsna Bhatt in Baroda. “An important modern ceramist herself, it shows her as an accomplice of the artist’s experiments with the camera. The care he takes in the darkroom, the patience and rigour, is deeply inspiring.”Some works, Mahendru says, have never been shown before. “They are also rare because they are produced as silver gelatin prints using analogue darkroom processes — exactly how Jyoti Bhatt made them originally. Showing them now allows new audiences to encounter the labour and thinking behind early photography.”At 92, Bhatt remains curious about what digital tools can do. “I return to images made earlier and reuse them in different ways. I am also interested in play — the human mind, chess, board games, arranging and re-arranging letters, numbers and patterns. I think curiosity doesn’t belong to one time,” he says. “The tools may change, but the urge to explore remains the same.”","A Painter with a Camera: Jyoti Bhatt at Subcontinent Gallery in Fort is on view till February 21, 2026.

He called for the exclusion of senior players including Babar Azam , Shadab Khan and Shaheen Shah Afridi, stating that they had been given ample opportunities over the years without delivering consistent results. Notably, Shaheen is married to Afridi’s daughter Ansha.""Drop Shaheen, drop Shadab, and drop Babar. Try fresh faces against Namibia and give the new players a chance to build confidence. They've been playing for a long time. Whenever we expect them to perform, they don't.

The ball was gripping as well. So, the execution was, I think, missing when it comes to bowling, but I think the pitch better played better in the second inning than first inning.

The upcoming T20 World Cup Group B fixture between Zimbabwe and Ireland is far more than just another league game — it could decide Australia’s fate and shape the Super 8 line-up.On Monday, Sri Lanka stormed into the Super 8s with a dominant eight-wicket win over Australia.

T20 World Cup: India humiliate Pakistan again

NEW DELHI: Pakistan cricket team captain Salman Ali Agha on Sunday shared his thoughts on the defeat to India in the ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2026 match and admitted his team did not perform well.He said the team trusted their spinners, but they had a bad day and failed to execute their plans properly against India batters.

He said the pitch was difficult early on, with the ball gripping, but it became better for batting later. He admitted the bowlers did not adjust to the situation, and the batters did not play long enough to take the game deep.Talking about pressure in big matches, he added, ""In these kinds of games, the emotions are always going to be high. We just need to deal with that because we have played enough cricket and we have played enough games like that.So, it's just we need to gather ourselves very quickly, and we have a game in two days' time, and we need to look forward to that as well.""Looking ahead to the rest of the tournament, he stressed staying positive and focusing on the bigger goal, saying, ""Yeah, obviously, you have to see the bigger picture.

T20 World Cup: India humiliate Pakistan again

NEW DELHI: Pakistan ’s crushing 61-run defeat to arch-rivals India in the ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2026 has largely been framed around their shortcomings, especially after they were bowled out for just 114 while chasing 176. Much of the discussion has centred on Pakistan’s lack of intensity and inability to match the defending champions India, particularly with the bat.However, former India cricketer Mohammed Kaif believes that narrative has unfairly overshadowed India’s own excellence on the night. While acknowledging that Pakistan fell well short of the required standard, Kaif argued that India’s quality and composure under pressure deserved far greater recognition.Speaking on ABP News, Kaif expressed frustration at the way the debate was shaped, singling out former Pakistan pacer Shoaib Akhtar for focusing heavily on Pakistan’s struggles rather than India’s performance.“Ever since we started the show I’m not happy, because you have been saying the Pakistan team is anyway weak, is an unenergetic team. If that team had won today, then 100% Shoaib Akhtar would be saying right now that BCCI is prideful, that the players had too much ego,” argued Kaif.“I want to say that by showing Pakistan as weak, you are taking away India’s excellence. You have just been showing that Pakistan is in trouble, that there’s no system, but what does that matter for India?” he continued.Kaif pointed to Ishan Kishan ’s match-winning 77 off 40 balls as an example of India thriving under extreme pressure. The opener, playing his first game against Pakistan, delivered one of the standout knocks in India-Pakistan T20 World Cup history despite the challenging surface.“We are talking about India, the Indian captain, Ishan Kishan who has played against Pakistan for the first time – how much pressure he must have on him, we aren’t talking about that. Give India’s players the credit because they are playing in a circumstance where imagine if they lost, then it would have been an outcry,” Kaif pointed out.He also underlined the intense scrutiny Indian players face in such high-stakes clashes, recalling how criticism can spiral after defeats like the 2021 World Cup loss.“You would say Suryakumar Yadav isn’t shaking hands and now the team has lost, they think they are so brave. Ishan Kishan, Jasprit Bumrah , all would have been on trial if they lost this match today,” stated Kaif.With India now through to the Super 8 stage, Kaif’s remarks serve as a reminder that victories in contests of this magnitude are built not only on opposition errors but on skill, temperament and the ability to withstand enormous pressure.",India beat Pakistan by 61 runs in ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2026. Pakistan were bowled out for just 114 while chasing 176. Former India cricketer Mohammed Kaif believes that narrative has unfairly overshadowed India’s own excellence on the night.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128421160,imgsize-142460,width-400,resizemode-4/colombo-sri-lanka-feb-15-ani-india39s-hardik-pandya-and-teammates-celebrate.jpg"

Mike Hesson press conference: 'Ishan took the game away from us' after India beat Pakistan

NEW DELHI: Former India spin-bowling all-rounder Ravichandran Ashwin came down hard on Pakistan following their comprehensive defeat to the Men in Blue in the ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2026, identifying the toss as the turning point of the highly-anticipated contest.India registered a commanding 61-run win in Colombo, and Ashwin felt Pakistan’s decision to bowl first after winning the toss handed India a decisive edge on a surface where chasing has been challenging throughout the tournament.“Where did they win to lose the plot? Pakistan lost the game when they opted to bowl first after winning the toss because we saw the match between Australia and Zimbabwe. Australia struggled to get 170. When we see IPL matches, teams win easily if they need 100 runs off the last 10 overs. But it’s not happening in this World Cup. In Premadasa Stadium, you can’t chase 100 in ten overs. The way Pakistan deals with pressure, India are 100 times better in that aspect. I don’t think Pakistan are there. Honestly, Pakistan have become tactically better under Salman Agha and Mike Hesson. But the way they brought Shaheen Afridi after Agha’s first over was a terrible mistake,” Ashwin said on his YouTube channel Ash ki Baat.Ashwin also raised questions over Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha’s use of his bowlers in the powerplay, particularly the early introduction of Shaheen Afridi instead of exploring alternate match-ups.“You took Abhishek Sharma’s wicket, and he is leaking runs left, right and centre. We noted in the preview how dangerous Ishan Kishan is against left-arm seam. I feel cricketers need to be explained, ‘This is your match-up’. Data tells the truth. When you say Ishan is taking on left-arm seam, he is taking it on. I’m not saying don’t bowl left-arm seam to him, but they must do something different. If Shaheen was getting whacked, I would’ve loved to see him come round the wicket to the left-hander. He didn’t do it, and the second over should have been Saim Ayub.""He further criticised Pakistan’s failure to regain control in the death overs, pointing out how Afridi’s return spell allowed India to surge ahead.“The fast bowler released the pressure. India were 159 after 19 overs, and Afridi was brought again, and he leaked runs again. Afridi gave away 16 runs in the final over,” he added.India will wrap up their league-stage campaign against the Netherlands in Ahmedabad on Wednesday before shifting focus to the Super 8s.",Former India spin-bowling all-rounder Ravichandran Ashwin came down hard on Pakistan following their comprehensive defeat to the Men in Blue in the ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2026.

The Miami Dolphins have officially released eight-time Pro Bowl wide receiver Tyreek Hill on Monday. The move, first reported by ESPN’s Adam Schefter, comes as the Dolphins look to navigate a dire salary cap situation and a roster in transition following a disappointing 2025 run. Hill, who turns 32 in March, will become an unrestricted free agent for the first time in his 10-year NFL career.The release was largely due to Hill’s massive contract. Before today’s announcement, he was set to carry a staggering $51.1 million cap hit for the 2026 season.By moving on from ""Cheetah"" now, the Dolphins achieve the following:The decision was also influenced by Hill’s health. His 2025 season ended abruptly in Week 4 against the New York Jets when he suffered a dislocated left knee and a torn ACL. While Hill’s agent, Drew Rosenhaus, has maintained that the receiver is on track for a Week 1 return in 2026, many league insiders remain skeptical. Hill’s game has always been built on elite, world-class speed; at nearly 32 years old and coming off a major reconstructive knee surgery, his future effectiveness remains one of the biggest question marks of this free-agency cycle.Hill wasn't the only casualty of the Dolphins' roster purge. In what local media are calling a ""housecleaning"" under new leadership, the team also released:Rumors have already begun swirling about potential landing spots:Despite the injury, the market for a player of Hill’s caliber is expected to be competitive. He leaves Miami with 4,733 receiving yards and 27 touchdowns over four seasons.","The Miami Dolphins have officially released wide receiver Tyreek Hill.

Switzerland is ready to give its all against Italy despite immense pressure



Switzerland faces a dangerous single-elimination matchup Tuesday when it takes on host Italy at Rho Arena in the Olympic qualifying playoff round. The fifth-seeded Swiss drew the 12th-seeded Italians in a game that carries enormous pressure despite the seeding difference.Captain Roman Josi made it clear his team cannot afford to overlook the hosts, even after Italy suffered an 11-0 loss to Finland in its final preliminary game. The veteran defenseman knows one mistake sends Switzerland home empty-handed.The Swiss finished 2-1-0-0 in Group A play after defeating Czechia 4-3 in overtime Sunday, a character-building victory that provided important lessons heading into the knockout stage. That win secured second place in the group and set up Tuesday's qualifier at the smaller, more intimate venue known as HC2 for the Olympics.Josi emphasized the importance of winning the game in front of them before thinking about what comes next. If Switzerland advances, a quarterfinal matchup with Finland awaits, but the captain made it clear that's not where his team's attention belongs.""You've got to win that game before you can think about anything else,"" Josi said.""And I think you saw Italy; they played great against Sweden and played really well against Slovakia. There were tight games.""The Swiss captain pointed out that Italy's preliminary round wasn't as disastrous as Saturday's blowout suggests. The Italians hung with Sweden in a 5-2 loss that was tied 2-2 early in the second period, then lost just 3-2 to Slovakia before the Finland debacle.""I think every team would say that there's no easy game,"" Josi continued. ""So yeah, our focus is on tomorrow. We've got to play our best tomorrow, and then what happens after we can look to.""Switzerland's overtime victory against Czechia on Sunday gave the team valuable experience in handling a high-stakes game with momentum swings. The back-and-forth contest saw both teams trade goals before the Swiss found a way to win.""There were a lot of different challenges throughout the game,"" Josi said. ""It was a high-stakes game; there was a lot on the line. They tied it up, we scored again, and they tied it up again. There were a lot of ups and downs, and at the end we found a way to win it, which is a great character win for our group.""The qualifier begins at 6:10 a.m. ET Tuesday at Rho Arena, where an electric crowd is expected as Swiss fans travel from across the nearby border to support their team against the hosts.",Switzerland faces a dangerous single-elimination matchup against Italy.

Twins owner Tom Pohlad says Framber Valdez was top target in free agency

Framber Valdez begins new chapter with Detroit Tigers

Framber Valdez has officially started a new chapter in his career after signing a three-year, $115 million contract with the Detroit Tigers. But before landing in Detroit, another American League Central team was seriously trying to bring him in. The Minnesota Twins were among the teams pursuing the star left-hander this offseason. Twins owner Tom Pohlad revealed that the organization made a strong push to sign Valdez before he ultimately chose Detroit.Valdez, who spent six seasons with the Houston Astros, shared a heartfelt goodbye message to Houston fans on Instagram after his deal became official. His post included moments from his Astros journey, including a photo with the 2022 World Series trophy and highlights from key games. He wrote, “Houston, I want to say thank you for giving me the chance to be an Astro, and for being part of the family since the beginning. ” His message reflected gratitude as he closed one chapter and prepared to begin another in Detroit.As rumors surrounded Minnesota’s offseason plans, Pohlad confirmed that Valdez was viewed as the top pitcher available on the market.“He was the best pitcher on the market at that point,” Pohlad told The Minnesota Star Tribune.“We would’ve had a hell of a 1-2-3 punch [in the rotation], and it would be crazy not to look at that.”Valdez posted a 3.66 ERA with 187 strikeouts and a 13-11 record in 31 starts last season with Houston. The 32-year-old was considered a marquee free agent, especially for teams looking to strengthen their starting rotation.Pohlad also said adding Valdez would have shown fans that the organization was serious about competing.“It would’ve been fun to make a splash and show the organization and the fans that we’re committed,” Pohlad said. “I do know that payroll matters to people. It wasn’t just about adding to the payroll. It was a decision that [General Manager Jeremy Zoll] thought was in the best interest of the team, and if he thought that, then I was going to be willing to go there for us.”Despite missing out on Valdez, Pohlad expressed confidence in Minnesota’s direction. The Twins finished 70-92 last season, fourth in the AL Central, but the owner pushed back on low expectations for 2026.“I want to be aggressive,” Pohlad said. “That’s my personality. But there is only so much we can do given the timing that we were in. We tried to be aggressive on some things. Those things didn’t work out, and here we are. But we really like our team.”Valdez made his MLB debut with Houston in August 2018 and quickly became a core part of the rotation. During his Astros career, he earned two All-Star selections, won the 2022 World Series, and was named to the All-MLB First Team.After entering free agency, he agreed to the major deal with Detroit on February 10. According to ESPN MLB insider Jeff Passan, the contract carries the highest average annual value ever for a left-handed pitcher and also the highest among Latin American pitchers. The Tigers secured one of the top pitchers on the market, even as a division rival tried to do the same.","Twins owner Tom Pohlad says Framber Valdez was top target in free agency.

Ethan Klein’s net worth and podcast success draw attention as online discussion grows





A billboard in Los Angeles referencing past controversy involving James Charles has sparked fresh online discussion, and podcaster Ethan Klein has now responded to the attention it received. The topic is leading many viewers to revisit Klein’s commentary and ask questions about his career success and net worth. The moment shows how internet conversations can return suddenly and draw wide public interest again.During a recent episode of his podcast, Ethan Klein reacted to the billboard and the sudden wave of attention surrounding it. He said he was surprised at how quickly a local display turned into a widely discussed online topic.According to Klein, internet culture moves fast but often repeats itself, bringing older stories back into focus when people least expect it.He told viewers, “The internet moves fast, but somehow it always circles back.” His comments were calm and focused more on how social media works rather than adding fresh conflict.He said that once something starts trending online, it may rapidly engage viewers far outside the initial setting.Fans on several channels posted excerpts from the podcast together with their own thoughts and responses.The initial point began a larger conversation about how digital audiences watch content which impacts storytelling and how authors approach the renewed interest in historical themes. The situation showed that podcast debates could develop into major online conflicts after a few hours of discussion.The public became more interested in Ethan Klein's work through the expanding discussions about billboards. The audience started to research his financial net worth and professional growth from his initial performance until his present success.Klein first gained popularity through YouTube before expanding into long-form podcasting with the H3 Podcast, which now attracts a steady audience and regular sponsorship support.The combination of his interview-based content with his commentary work has enabled him to maintain his digital media presence. The internet sources provide different value assessments yet multiple estimates show his net worth exists within the multi-million-dollar range which derives mainly from his podcast revenue and brand partnerships and online content.The current interest in public discussion shows how quickly people shift their attention from one event to investigate a creator's influence and business achievements.

Veteran forward Jeff Skinner put on unconditional waivers for contract termination

In a significant roster move, veteran forward Jeff Skinner was placed on unconditional waivers by the San Jose Sharks on Monday to terminate his one-year, $3 million contract, as per reports by Elliotte Friedman of Sportsnet.Previously, Skinner signed a one-year, $3 million contract with the Sharks last July. He had an impressive season, as the forward has posted six goals, 13 points, 56 shots on net, and 17 hits across 32 appearances with San Jose in the 2025-26 season. After his contract gets terminated, he will become an unrestricted free agent. This decision by the Sharks would bring a huge shift in Skinner’s tenure and would prompt speculation regarding the veteran forward's next landing spot. Veteran forward Jeff Skinner was placed on unconditional waivers by the San Jose Sharks on Monday for purposes of terminating his one-year, $3 million contract on Monday. Announcing the same, NHL Insider Elliotte Friedman wrote on his X/Twitter handle, “Jeff Skinner (SJ) on unconditional waivers for purposes of contract termination.”As for his performance, the 33-year-old forward has recorded 6 goals and 13 points with 56 shots in 32 games this season, but has been a healthy scratch for the last 10 outings before the Olympic break.He was acquired last July after playing with Edmonton and a buyout from the Buffalo Sabres, but couldn't secure a consistent lineup spot amid roster crunches.As per reports, Skinner joined the Sharks on a one-year deal worth $3 million that he signed in July, followed by a similar arrangement with the Edmonton Oilers for the previous season. In the 2024-25 season, he achieved 16 goals and 29 points in 72 games with Edmonton, also contributing one goal and two points during their playoff run to the Stanley Cup Final.Skinner also has an illustrious career in the NHL so far. The player had played an impressive 1,110 career games, and he has amassed 379 goals and 712 points. He scored over 30 goals in five seasons, achieving a personal best of 40 goals with the Buffalo Sabres during the 2018-19 season.If he clears the waivers unclaimed, Skinner would become an unrestricted free agent to sign elsewhere, freeing $3 million in cap space for San Jose. As Skinner’s time with the Sharks comes to an end, his future in the NHL remains uncertain. However, as many clubs are looking for potential candidates for their team, his NHL performance and experience may attract interest from other teams in need of a seasoned forward.","Jeff Skinner was placed on unconditional waivers by the San Jose Sharks on Monday for purposes of terminating his one-year, $3 million contract.

T20 World Cup: How Australia can still qualify for Super 8s

NEW DELHI: A shattered Mitchell Marsh did not hide his emotions after Australia crashed to a crushing eight-wicket defeat against Sri Lanka in a must-win clash at the Pallekele International Cricket Stadium on Monday, conceding his side’s fate in the tournament is now out of their hands.Australia posted 181 after a blazing start but were blown away by a sensational chase led by Pathum Nissanka , whose unbeaten century sealed Sri Lanka’s place in the Super 8s and left the former champions staring at an early exit.“It is a devastated group. We’re in the lap of the gods now, I think, with the way it’s shaped up,” Marsh said in a brutally honest assessment. “There’s a lot of emotion in the rooms right now. We haven’t been at our best… we’re a disappointed bunch at the moment.”At the halfway stage of their innings, Australia looked firmly in control. Marsh (54) and Travis Head (56) powered their side to a commanding 110/2, setting the platform for a massive total. But what followed was a dramatic collapse in momentum, as Sri Lanka’s bowlers tightened the screws.“Well, I thought it was a competitive total at the halfway mark.There’s no doubt we probably left ourselves a few short after the start that we had. So that’s disappointing,” Marsh admitted. “We know that at our best we can make big scores. And we just lost our way a little bit there towards the back-end. Couldn’t get a partnership going and Sri Lanka bowled really well.”He added with resignation: “Coming off, we knew we were a few short… not much else to say other than Sri Lanka outplayed us tonight.”Sri Lanka made Australia pay dearly. Nissanka’s breathtaking 100 not out off just 52 balls turned the chase into a statement, as Australia’s bowlers had no answers on a night when everything seemed to slip away.The defeat marked Australia’s second consecutive loss and left them in a precarious position in Group B. With just one win from three matches, their Super 8 hopes now hinge on other results — particularly the crucial clash between Zimbabwe and Ireland.Marsh admitted the team could only watch and hope.“We watch the Zimbabwe-Ireland game and we hope… but yeah, we’re a disappointed bunch at the moment,” he said.The qualification equation is tense and unforgiving.If Zimbabwe beat Ireland on Tuesday, Australia will be eliminated from the tournament. However, an Ireland victory will keep Australia’s hopes alive and open up a three-way fight for the remaining Super 8 spot.In that scenario, Zimbabwe’s final group match against Sri Lanka on February 19 will become decisive. A Zimbabwe win over the co-hosts will take them through to the Super 8s alongside Sri Lanka, ending Australia’s chances regardless of other results.But if Zimbabwe lose to Sri Lanka — and Ireland have already beaten Zimbabwe — then Zimbabwe and Ireland will both finish on four points, bringing net run rate into play to determine the second qualifier from the group.Australia, who face Oman on February 20 in their final match, will then enter the contest with a clear net run rate equation. They will need a convincing win and a favourable swing in numbers to stay alive and secure a dramatic late qualification.",Sri Lanka beat Australia by eight wickets in their T20 World Cup Group B clash.

Axar Patel press conference: 'We see them as a team, don't see rivalry' after India beat Pakistan

NEW DELHI: India wicketkeeper-batter Ishan Kishan credited the fans and his teammates after delivering a match-winning performance against Pakistan in the T20 World Cup on Sunday, saying the Player-of-the-Match honour was not his alone.Kishan said he approached the high-voltage clash with a calm mindset, treating it like any other fixture. He focused on watching the ball closely, assessing the pitch and target, and backing his natural game. There was no sense of panic, he noted, and he drew confidence from the plans discussed within the group. However, he stressed that the job is far from complete and that his focus has already shifted to the next game.Continuing his rich vein of form in T20s, Kishan countered Pakistan’s spin strategy with authority, striking his second consecutive T20 World Cup fifty. His fluent knock of 77 powered India to a commanding 61-run victory in Colombo. Behind the stumps too, he made a significant impact, highlighted by a sharp stumping to dismiss the dangerous Usman Khan, who was attempting to rebuild with a measured counter-attack.In a video shared by the Board of Control for Cricket in India, Ishan Kishan said: ""Not only for me, I feel this is for all the supporters who were supporting us throughout the game, throughout the tournament, when we were preparing very hard. So credit goes not just to me, but to the whole of India.""I think I was just keeping it simple, like I said in the press conference earlier that day it's just another game. You have to watch the ball and play your shots, which you believe in, which are on. You have to assess the wicket, how is it playing, what's the good total for all of our teammates, I think they had that in plan and that was giving me much confidence. There was no panic about anything before the match or in between the games. I was just keeping it simple and playing my shots. No, I think the job is not over. So I wouldn't say I'm very satisfied we need to forget this one and move on to the next game,"" he said.After winning the toss, Pakistan opted to bowl. India suffered an early setback when Abhishek departed for a duck, but Kishan’s aggressive 77 and Tilak’s composed 25 steadied the innings. The Men in Blue slipped to 126/4, losing their set batters along with all-rounder Hardik Pandya (0). Skipper Suryakumar, along with Shivam and Rinku, then ensured a strong finish, timing their acceleration well under challenging conditions. India posted 175/7, with Saim Ayub (3/25) emerging as Pakistan’s most successful bowler.In reply, Pakistan were rocked early, reduced to 34/4 by strikes from Hardik, Jasprit Bumrah and Axar Patel. Usman Khan fought back with 44 off 34 balls, including six fours and a six, but lacked substantial support as India bowled Pakistan out for 114 in 18 overs to seal their third straight win and advance to the Super 8 stage.Axar (2/29) led the bowling effort, while Hardik (2/16), Bumrah (2/17) and Varun Chakaravarthy (2/17) also chipped in with crucial wickets. India sit atop Group A with three wins from three matches. Pakistan are third with two victories and a defeat, while the USA hold second place with two wins and two losses. India’s head-to-head record against Pakistan in T20 World Cups now stands at eight wins and one loss.","Wicketkeeper-batter Ishan Kishan says credit goes not just to him, but to the whole of India.

What will Team India do today in Ahmedabad? Practice timing, Playing XI, press conference and more

KOLKATA: England quite expectedly scampered into the T20 World Cup Super Eights on Monday, but the seemingly comfortable 24-run win over Italy at the Eden Gardens could not hide the shortcomings that have plagued them in recent times.They crossed the 200-run mark for the first time in the tournament (202 for 7), but that was made possible through some rearguard action by Will Jacks . The allrounder’s unbeaten 53, in just 22 balls, was in contrast to the struggles of the top-order batters. Jos Buttler and skipper Harry Brook again failed to get going. Phil Salt, Jacob Bethell, Tom Banton all got starts, but failed to convert them into anything worthwhile. All this against an attack, which was at best club level.Monday afternoon’s match against Italy (178) might have been smooth sailing, but it definitely was not the corner that Brook had wished they would turn.Jacks came onto the crease at 105 for five in the 13th over, with statisticians starting to work on the Group C permutations in case England lost. His 54-run partnership with Sam Curran settled the nerves. And then with Jamie Overton’s support, he made England’s score look daunting enough.Against better bowling attacks, the English batters’ struggles could be further exposed and a saviour like Banton (as against Scotland) or Jacks (as against Italy) might not always be forthcoming. The English bowling attack too was not all that consistent, with pace spearhead Jofra Archer the best example of that. A fiery first over saw him pick up two wickets, giving away just one run. However, by the end of his first spell of three overs, he had conceded 22 runs. Spinners Jacks and Adil Rashid were quite costly.Ben Manenti (60, 25b, 4x4, 6x6) and Justin Mosca (43, 33b, 7x4), with their Australian upbringing, had some harsh lessons for the English bowlers during their 92-run fourth-wicket stand, aided by some helpful deliveries. Manenti’s dismissal ended whatever resistance they were putting up, although an entertaining 22-ball 45 by Grant Stewart kept the crowd in the stands roaring.To their credit, the Italians were not over-awed while playing against a full-member nation for the first time in this World Cup. Another one, the West Indies, loom on Thursday.Brief scores: England 202-7 in 20 overs (Will Jacks 53*, Tom Banton 30; Crishan Kalugamage 2-41, Grant Stewart 2-51) beat Italy 178 all out in 20 overs (Ben Manenti 60, Grant Stewart 45; Jamie Overton 3-18, Sam Curran 3-22) by 24 runs.","England beat Italy by 24 runs in the T20 World Cup Super Eights.

Zimbabwe face Ireland in a decisive Group B game at Pallekele on Tuesday, knowing that a victory will secure a spot in the Super Eight stage of this T20 World Cup.

Axar Patel press conference: 'We see them as a team, don't see rivalry' after India beat Pakistan

One of the heartening features of West Indies' unbeaten run in the 2026 T20 World Cup, which has seen them win all their three league games so far to storm into the Super 8s, has been the fine form of their former captain Jason Holder . The 34-year-old all-rounder took three for 30 in the opener against Scotland at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata, before chipping in with a vital 17-ball 33, which included four massive sixes against England at the Wankhede Stadium in his team's 30-run win over their traditional rivals.Holder was taken off the attack after going wicketless while conceding 34 in just two overs against England. However, on Sunday, at the same venue, the seasoned pacer rediscovered his mojo against Nepal, taking a wicket off his first and last balls to finish with four for 27, even though his final over went for 16.“Yeah, it was a bit up and down. But I will take it. Getting four wickets in a World Cup can be a bit special, and to be able to do it today was good,” Holder told reporters after the match.With seven wickets in three matches at 13.00, Holder is currently the highest wicket-taker for the West Indies.Sunday's win offered relief to the West Indies after they had stunningly lost a T20I series to the Associate nation 1-2 in September last year at Sharjah. “Nepal has obviously been a team that’s been very competitive, and they’ve beaten us in the recent past as well. We knew we had to come up really hard in this game and make sure we started really well,” Holder said.Holder asserted that being a captain or simply a player in the team didn't matter to him, as long as he was contributing to the team's success as a senior player, putting all his experience in internationals and franchise cricket to good use. ""Look, my role in the teams I've played in has been very clear for me. I guess here in this team, we've got a lot of heavy power in terms of our batting. So my role with the bat is probably a little less demanding than the role with the ball. But having said that, for me, it's just playing the situation. Post-captaincy or captaincy, it doesn't make a difference to me. For me, it's about what I need to do in order for this team to be successful,"" the veteran all-rounder analysed.Asked about the lack of express fast bowlers coming out of the West Indies these days, Holder said that much of that could be put down to the slow pitches in the Caribbean at present. ""Look, there's been a lot of debate as to why, over the years, we've had some very slow pitches. We don't quite get the quick pitches that we used to get on a consistent basis in the Caribbean. So, that may have a bit to do with it, but look, it is what it is in terms of what we've got. I think what is important for us is to use what we've got well, put some support behind them and ensure that we can develop them in a way that they can be world-class bowlers,"" he said.The seasoned fast bowler pointed out that pace alone wasn't the sole factor to guarantee success in international cricket, but “accuracy and skill” were. ""You don't necessarily have to be ‘express’ to be successful at this level, but if you're very accurate and skilful, you can get some good success here at this level. So, it's important for the West Indies to continue to put some support behind our fast bowlers to ensure that they keep developing their skills. ""Holder said that a good team environment was one of the key reasons for the West Indies enjoying a fine run in the 2026 T20 World Cup. ""In the dressing room, we've created an environment where everybody is a lot more comfortable, a lot more clear. We've been having a lot of in-depth conversations. And it's been good to see the maturity level of each individual putting their hands up,"" Holder explained.""And so far, we've been doing a really good job. And the beauty about each game that we've won is that different people have stepped up and it hasn't been like one consistent person in every single game. The main thing for us is to stay focused and ensure that we continue with this momentum.""",West Indies have won all three of their games at the 2026 T20 World Cup.

NHL Insider Chris Johnston Reports Nazem Kadri Would Favor Montreal



The Nazem Kadri trade speculation has intensified as the deadline approaches, with Montreal emerging as a potential landing spot for the veteran center. The connection makes sense on paper as the Canadiens search for depth down the middle to support their young core.What wasn't clear until recently was whether Kadri would even want to play in Montreal. The 34-year-old holds a modified no-trade clause that includes 13 teams, giving him significant control over any potential move. And one prominent NHL insider recently shed light on Kadri’s preferences.The Athletic's Chris Johnston recently made trade deadline predictions alongside colleague James Mirtle, naming the Canadiens as Kadri's most likely destination. The reporting included a crucial detail that should interest Montreal management.""The fact he would be in favor of a move to the Habs, according to league sources, should bring a measure of comfort,"" Johnston wrote. ""Kadri has a 13-team no-trade list, and Montreal isn't on it."" The willingness to waive his clause for Montreal removes one potential roadblock, but significant hurdles remain.Kadri carries a $7 million cap hit through the 2028-29 season, meaning any acquiring team inherits three more years after this one.He'll turn 38 in the final year of that deal. Meanwhile, Frank Seravalli previously reported the Canadiens aren't thrilled about the term, preferring a contract with only one or two years remaining.That suggests Kadri might be a backup option if Montreal strikes out on other centers. The bigger problem is Montreal's cap situation. The Canadiens project to have just $1.49 million in space at the March 6 deadline, making it impossible to absorb Kadri's contract without moving salary out first.Patrik Laine's $8.7 million cap hit represents the most obvious candidate to clear space, but finding a willing trade partner for that contract presents its own challenges. The Canadiens would need to solve that puzzle before they could seriously pursue Kadri.Calgary has already traded Rasmus Andersson and appears open to moving veterans as they slide toward the bottom of the standings. With the Olympic roster freeze lifting February 22, teams have two weeks to finalize deals before the deadline hits.Kadri will be bringing some much-needed veteran experience to the Canadiens roster. For a side that remains among the youngest in the league, the addition of someone who knows what it takes to win a Stanley Cup counts for a lot. The fans on both sides keep a close watch on the happenings.","NHL Insider Chris Johnston Reports Nazem Kadri Would Favor Montreal over Calgary.

Suryakumar Yadav press conference: How SKY trolled India-Pakistan rivalry

NEW DELHI: Opener Pathum Nissanka turned a challenging chase into a masterclass on Monday, smashing a blistering 100 not out off 52 balls to guide Sri Lanka to an emphatic eight-wicket victory over Australia at the Pallekele International Cricket Stadium.The win not only secured Sri Lanka’s spot in the Super Eight stage of the T20 World Cup but also left Australia’s qualification hopes hanging by a thread.

Pavan Rathnayake added a quick 28 off 15 balls as the hosts raced to 184/2 in just 18 overs, maintaining a commanding run rate throughout.Australia, sent in to bat, got off to a flying start with Mitchell Marsh (54 off 27) and Travis Head (56 off 29) adding 104 runs in less than nine overs. Their power-hitting set Australia up for a total beyond 200, with boundaries and sixes flowing freely.However, Sri Lanka clawed their way back in the latter half of the innings.Leg-spinner Dushan Hemantha emerged as the standout bowler with figures of 3/37 in four overs, while Dushmantha Chameera and Dunith Wellalage picked up crucial wickets.Australia collapsed from 104/0 to 130/4 and eventually folded for 181.Pathum Nissanka also redeemed himself in the field, taking a brilliant diving catch to dismiss Glenn Maxwell.Sri Lanka suffered an early setback when Kusal Perera was caught at deep backward point, but Nissanka and Mendis ensured the chase remained under control.Even after Mendis’s dismissal by Marcus Stoinis, there was no stopping Nissanka, who carried the team over the line with 12 balls to spare.The result marks a dramatic turnaround for Sri Lanka, while Australia, who had earlier been humbled by Zimbabwe, now face a precarious path to the Super Eight.The hosts’ combination of explosive batting and clinical bowling proved too much for the Australians, highlighting Sri Lanka’s momentum and Australia’s vulnerability in the tournament.",Pathum Nissanka scores 100 not out as Sri Lanka beat Australia by eight wickets.

Alysa Liu’s early retirement, personal reasons, and strong comeback that led to World Championship and Olympic success

Alysa Liu shocked figure skating fans when she retired at just 16 in 2022, shortly after competing at the Winter Olympics. Many people thought her career was only getting started, but she chose to step away from the sport. Liu said she had already reached the goals she set for herself and wanted to live life outside skating for a while.Her story, however, did not end with retirement. Having been away from competition for nearly two years, Liu came back with a fresh attitude. Back stronger, she captured the 2025 World Figure Skating Championships before assisting Team USA in earning gold at the 2026 Winter Olympics. Her return quickly rose to be among the most talked-about news in figure skating.Alysa Liu’s rise started very early. Born in Oakland, California, she became the youngest U.S. women’s national champion at just 13 years old.People noticed her confidence and her difficult jumps, and she soon became one of the most exciting young skaters in the country. She went on to represent the United States at big international events, including the 2022 Winter Olympics.But soon after that season ended, Liu surprised everyone by announcing her retirement.She explained that figure skating had taken up most of her life from a very young age.According to her, she had achieved the goals she wanted and felt ready to experience life away from the ice. She said, “I have no regrets. I’m sure it would be the opposite if I stayed in skating.”Liu also shared that the pressure of the sport sometimes made it less fun for her. Her decision was not because of injury or poor results.It was simply a personal choice to pause and reset. During her time away, she enjoyed a different pace of life without intense training schedules.After nearly two years, she began to miss competing and performing. That feeling slowly pushed her toward a return. Many fans were surprised, but she quickly proved she was back at a high level.Liu won the 2025 World Figure Skating Championships and later said, “I’m not going to lie, this is an insane story. I don’t know how I came back to be World Champion.” Her comeback reached another big moment at the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan-Cortina.Liu's 74.90 points in the women's short program in the team event contributed significantly to Team USA's overall score. The United States' winning of the team gold medal was much influenced by her performance.Later, Liu said, “I want people to see everything about me,” showing that her journey is about more than medals, it is about growth, honesty, and finding balance.","Alysa Liu shocked figure skating fans when she retired at just 16 in 2022.

Rick Celebrini remained sure of his son through thick and thin



Rick Celebrini received a phone call from his son Macklin as the young star waited at San Francisco International Airport for his flight to New York, where Team Canada's charter would take them to Italy for the Olympics. The Sharks sensation had a myriad of questions running through his mind.But just mere days later, Macklin was at Canada's first practice and discovered he was skating with No. 97. The teenager went from wondering if he'd get ice time to centering a fantasy line with Connor McDavid and Nathan MacKinnon , becoming the youngest NHLer ever named to Canada's Olympic roster.The phone call from the airport captured the whirlwind nature of Macklin's rise. He wanted reassurance from his father, asking if Canada would really bring him all that way just to sit on the bench.Rick Celebrini, the Warriors' vice president of player health and performance, assured his son he would play. But even the father couldn't have imagined what came next. The ""Three Macs"" line featuring McDavid, MacKinnon and Macklin became reality from the opening faceoff.The youngest player on Canada's roster would skate alongside two generational talents, proving his inclusion wasn't ceremonial.Rick Celebrini has trained Steve Nash and Steph Curry during his decades in professional sports.The 58-year-old former Canadian soccer player has seen championships and worked with some of the biggest names in basketball and hockey. His stoic exterior rarely cracks. But watching his son represent Canada at the Olympics? That hit differently.""The first game, I was legit nervous,"" Celebrini said. ""I've been more nervous than I've been in a long time watching any of the kids' sports games. And I think Mack was, well, I know Mack was really nervous as well."" He was also there when his son scored Canada’s first goal against Czechia.With that, he surpassed Jonathan Toews as the youngest Canadian NHL player to score an Olympic goal. The assist came from MacKinnon. ""When he scored that goal, I think it settled us all down,"" Celebrini continued. ""I think the whole team was nervous. But I think when he got that tip goal, it just kind of allowed us to breathe a little bit and relax.""The rise happened faster than anyone imagined. Macklin finished third in Calder Trophy voting as a rookie, then opened his second season with 23 points in 15 games. Rick Celebrini didn't think this year was realistic until Macklin's hot start made it impossible to ignore.Now his son leads the tournament with four goals through three preliminary games, contributing meaningfully on hockey's biggest stage. Canada enters the knockout rounds as a gold medal favorite with Macklin skating alongside the game's elite, turning an airport phone call into Olympic reality.","Macklin Celebrini is the youngest NHLer ever named to Canada's Olympic roster.

T20 World Cup: India humiliate Pakistan again

Former India captain Sunil Gavaskar lauded skipper Suryakumar Yadav for bringing sharp match awareness into India’s game after their commanding 61-run victory over Pakistan in the ongoing ICC Men's T20 World Cup in Colombo.Gavaskar underlined how Suryakumar stepped up in contrasting pressure situations. He recalled the game against USA, where India were reeling at 77 for 6 before Surya guided them out of trouble. Against Pakistan, he walked in at 88/2 and anchored the innings through to the 19th over, compiling 32 from 29 balls with three boundaries as India posted 175/7 in 20 overs to seal a Super 8 berth.""You have to play according to the situation, and that is what Captain Suryakumar Yadav has done. He has led from the front. In the match against the USA, when India were in trouble at 77 for 6, Surya bailed the team out and here against Pakistan, when he came out to bat, India were at 88-2, and then he batted till the 19th over, scoring 32 runs. Yes, he didn't bat at a high strike rate, but he ensured that the wickets didn't fall, keeping hold of one end. """"So, the rest of the team understands that in T20 cricket, you don't want dot balls.You want to reduce them, but you also don't want to throw your wicket away trying to hit sixes.

Suryakumar then combined with Shivam Dube and Rinku Singh to ensure a strong finish despite testing conditions. Saim Ayub’s 3/25 was the standout bowling effort for Pakistan.Pakistan’s reply never gathered momentum. Early breakthroughs from Hardik, Jasprit Bumrah and Axar Patel reduced them to 34/4.

HH Sheikh Hamdan's tribute

Who was Ramesh Shukla?

Historic images defies the UAE’s memory

A legacy in UAE history





Dubai has lost one of its most iconic visual storytellers. Ramesh Shukla, the Indian expat widely known as the “royal photographer who chronicled the UAE’s history,” died on Sunday at age 87 at Rashid Hospital after suffering a cardiac arrest, his family confirmed.Shukla had been battling heart problems over the past year and endured several attacks, yet he continued working passionately until his final days. His son, Neel Shukla, recounted that even in the hospital, his father remained upbeat, energetic, and still talked about his work before suddenly going into cardiac arrest.https://x.com/HamdanMohammed/status/2023294473384648928?s=20Tributes poured in across the UAE, led by His Highness Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, who praised Shukla’s dedication and contribution to preserving the country’s defining moments.Shukla was more than a photographer. He was a witness to history. His images shaped how Emiratis remember their past and how the world sees the UAE’s evolution.Even in his later years, despite heart problems, he continued working and organising his archive. According to his family, he wanted to keep documenting until his final days, and he did.For over six decades, Ramesh Shukla quietly documented the transformation of the United Arab Emirates from desert towns into a global powerhouse.On Sunday, the man many called the UAE’s “royal photographer” passed away in Dubai at the age of 87 after suffering cardiac arrest.Shukla arrived in the Emirates in 1965, travelling by boat from Mumbai with little money and a single Rolleicord camera. At the time, the UAE had not yet been formed. Roads were limited, skyscrapers did not exist, and oil wealth had not fully transformed the region.His early break came while photographing a camel race in Sharjah attended by Sheikh Zayed and other rulers. His talent and dedication quickly earned him trust and access to historic state occasions.Over time, Shukla became a familiar presence at official gatherings, always discreet but always present. He documented not just royalty, but the story of a nation in motion, construction sites rising from sand, ports expanding, children growing up in a new country, and leaders shaping a shared future.Though never officially titled, the phrase “royal photographer” was first used by Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum, who recognised Shukla’s extraordinary role in chronicling the nation’s leadership and defining milestones.Shukla is survived by his wife Tarun Shukla and son Neel Shukla. His death marks the end of an era in UAE visual history.Ramesh Shukla captured some of the most powerful images in Emirati history.Among them was the iconic photograph of Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan signing the declaration of the Union on December 2, 1971, the day the UAE was officially formed.Another legendary image, often referred to as the “Spirit of the Union,” shows the founding fathers standing together beneath the UAE flag. That very photograph is now featured on the country’s Dh50 currency note, making Shukla’s work part of everyday Emirati life.His archive spans decades of leadership events, national celebrations, camel races, official ceremonies and everyday scenes of a country rapidly changing before his lens.Today, his photographs are preserved at institutions such as the Etihad Museum and the Zayed National Museum, ensuring future generations can see the UAE’s journey through his eyes.Few expatriates have left such a lasting imprint on the Emirates. Through wars, celebrations, leadership transitions and national milestones, Ramesh Shukla stood behind the camera, capturing moments that now define a nation.His photographs live on in museums, official collections, metro displays, books and even currency. But more importantly, they live on in the collective memory of the UAE.The man behind the lens may be gone, but the nation he helped document will always remember him.","Ramesh Shukla arrived in the Emirates in 1965, travelling by boat from Mumbai with little money and a single Rolleicord camera.

Jasontheween’s island survival stream sparks “scripted” allegations online







Twitch streamer Jason ""Jasontheween"" has elicited a lot of controversy throughout the streaming circles after announcing his ambitious 7 Days Stranded IRL, a survival challenge that lasted a week on a personal island. The 24/7 livestream was now being promoted as an independent endurance event, and soon enough, people were watching the old FaZe Clan member as he tries to navigate being isolated, with limited food supplies, and with the psychological burden of being disconnected to the civilized world.And interest soon changed to doubt. One of the clips posted on day one went viral on the Reddit r/LivestreamFail subboard, sparking a series of allegations that the survival challenge was more a performance than a challenge. The video clip shows Jason coming by boat with a cameraman before commencing with the marathon stream making people wonder how lonely he is and whether the set up had been made beforehand.During the broadcast, Jason added intrigue by describing a mysterious tree on the island, saying: ""There's also another tree on this island, where if you eat an apple from the tree, it's called the 'death tree,' you'll die. Yes, death in an hour.You'll die. But, bottoms up. Hopefully, this is not the death tree.""The remark entertained viewers but also fueled doubt about the authenticity of the experience. Online critics quickly dissected the stream’s logistics. Several users argued that the presence of a cameraman, visible navigation confidence, and seemingly preselected camp spots suggested advance planning rather than raw survival.""Has a cameraman Predetermined camp spot Pre-scouted the area all scripted"" one Reddit user wrote.Others echoed similar concerns, questioning whether real survival conditions can exist when a streamer has chat access, donations, and production support guiding decisions. ""Looks like he has a scripted roadmap so he knows where everything is Edit: He literally went off the pre-planned route for a few minutes, got scared, and turned back. lmao""The stream also became entangled in personal drama when a donation asked whether “sinister sisters” would join him, referencing streamers Kyedae and Sakura Shymko. Jason pushed back firmly:""'Jason, will the sinister sisters be joining you?' Yo, bro, stop calling them that. I don't fk with that st at all. That s**t is not funny. And, bro, what's up with the internet, man? I literally said she didn't cheat, and all of incel Twitter be saying that she cheated.""His response reflects ongoing fallout from his recent breakup announcement, in which he insisted no infidelity occurred.As the week unfolds, the survival challenge sits at the intersection of entertainment, authenticity, and online scrutiny. Whether scripted spectacle or genuine endurance test, the broadcast has achieved what many livestreams struggle to do: keep the internet watching, debating, and clicking refresh.","Twitch streamer Jason ""Jasontheween"" has elicited a lot of controversy after announcing his ambitious 7 Days Stranded IRL, a survival challenge that lasted a week on a personal island.

Predators vs. Bruins | NHL Highlights | January 27, 2026

The Boston Bruins are reportedly looking for three potential defensemen to boost their blue line as the NHL trade deadline approaches in March 2026. As per reports, the Bruins have been looking forward to improving the right side of their defense, but who the team would target is the biggest question. Speculations are suggesting the names of some key targets that the Bruins could acquire ahead of the trade deadline.However, nothing has been confirmed by the club's management so far. Though the Bruins' decision to trade defenseman Brandon Carlo has proven to be a smart and successful move over time. Despite the trade's success, the Bruins still lack a true top-four elite defenseman to fill Carlo's role on their blue line, fueling current trade rumors. Let’s take a look at the potential trade targets that the Bruins are planning to consider. NHL’s Boston Bruins are reportedly targeting to bolster their defense line-up by including three elite defenseman on their team. Speculations are doing the rounds that the club is planning to acquire three top defensemen from several other NHL teams. Earlier, the club targeted to acquire Rasmus Andersson. However, they missed out on the player as he was later acquired by the Vegas Golden Knights from the Calgary Flames.According to reports by The Hockey News, they are targeting potential players like Justin Faulk, Braden Schneider, and Zach Whitecloud to boost their blue line. Justin Faulk of the St. Louis Blues tops the list as a proven top-four option, boasting 11 goals, 19 assists, and 30 points in 52 games this season. It is expected that the defenseman would be a nice fit on the second pairing and power play if acquired.Apart from Faulk, Zach Whitecloud of the Calgary Flames is another potential candidate. According to reports, Whitecloud has a $2.75 million cap hit until the end of the 2027-28 season. Whitecloud has played in 55 games this season, where he has recorded two goals, eight assists, 10 points, and 86 hits. The Flames player would also be a nice fit for the Bruins, given his impressive performance this season.Another player could be the New York Rangers’ Braden Schiender, who has played 57 games this season, and the pending restricted free agent (RFA) has recorded two goals, nine assists, 11 points, and 123 hits. He could be an excellent fit for retooling the Bruins club. It would be interesting to witness who among them will join the Boston Bruins ahead of the March 6 trade deadline.","The Boston Bruins are reportedly looking for three potential defensemen to boost their blue line.

Jutta Leerdam is winning on the ice and off it. The Dutch speed skater, who is engaged to Jake Paul , has just taken home gold and silver at the Winter Olympics. But her celebration after the 1,000m race is now being talked about almost as much as her record time. After winning gold and setting an Olympic record, Jutta Leerdam unzipped her racing suit and revealed her white Nike sports top. The photo spread fast online.

Dutch retailer Hema posted an ad for eyeliner saying, “Water-resistant, even with tears of joy.”Away from endorsements, Jake Paul openly shared his emotions. After her gold medal, he said, “Man, words can’t even describe it. It’s the greatest feeling of anything I’ve ever witnessed, to be honest.” He added, “Just the amount of hard work that goes into it.

And she pulled it off, under the most amount of pressure ever.”Later, he posted a celebration video and wrote, “Time to celebrate.”Still, not everyone back home is cheering. Earlier in the Games, Leerdam faced criticism after flying by private jet to Milan-Cortina. She shared parts of the trip on Instagram.
