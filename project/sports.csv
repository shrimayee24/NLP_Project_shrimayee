NEW DELHI: Shubman Gill 's resurgence couldn't have come at a better time for Gujarat Titans , as they gear up for a crucial showdown against table-toppers Kolkata Knight Riders in a must-win IPL clash on Monday. Gill's scintillating century in their previous outing against Chennai Super Kings not only revived GT's playoff aspirations but also showcased his match-winning prowess.The partnership of Gill and Sai Sudharsan, both notching centuries in their last game, laid the foundation for a formidable total, underscoring their significance for the Titans as they prepare to face KKR, the first team to secure a playoff berth.With seven teams still vying for playoff spots, the competition intensifies. While Rajasthan Royals and Chennai Super Kings hold firm in the top three positions, Sunrisers Hyderabad and the trio of Royal Challengers Bangalore, Delhi Capitals, and Lucknow Super Giants remain in contention, each with 12 points apiece.Gujarat Titans, currently at 10 points, face an uphill battle to qualify, needing to maximise their points while grappling with a negative net run rate. While their chances seem slim, the Titans are determined to defy the odds, knowing that only extraordinary performances can keep their mathematical hopes alive.Gujarat Titans have had the upper hand against Kolkata Knight Riders, securing victory in two of their last three encounters against KKR.Ahmedabad offers equal chances to both batters and bowlers. The last time Gujarat played at this venue, fans witnessed a high-scoring thriller. Gill’s team batted first and ended up making 231/3. Both openers, Gill and Sai Sudharshan, scored a hundred each. Chennai Super Kings (CSK) failed to chase, scoring only 196/8 in 20 overs.With six matches played at this venue, the dynamics favor both batting first and second. While teams batting second have emerged victorious on four occasions, those batting first have clinched victory twice. This balance suggests that the pitch offers opportunities for both setting a target and chasing it down.The average first innings total stands at 175, indicating that the pitch provides a platform for competitive scores. However, teams batting second have managed to chase down targets successfully, with an average second innings total of 171, highlighting the venue's reputation as conducive to thrilling run chases.KKR’s veteran, Narine, has been in terrific form this season. Opening the batting, the Caribbean all-rounder has amassed 461 runs. Even though KKR has made it to the knockout stages, Narine will look to contribute more.Yet another KKR opener who has been making headlines is Phil Salt. In 12 games, the keeper-batter has made 435 runs.Gujarat’s flamboyant left-hander has been in scintillating form this season.

NEW DELHI: In the 60th IPL match, Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) exhibited resilience against Mumbai Indians (MI) despite facing an early challenge. Venkatesh Iyer's explosive 21-ball 42 and Nitish Rana's resurgence with 33 runs laid a solid foundation for KKR, propelling them to a competitive total of 157/7 in 16 overs at Eden Gardens.The pivotal 37-run partnership between Iyer and Rana for the fourth wicket showcased their fine shot-making abilities and determination.Iyer's aggressive stroke-play, featuring six boundaries and two sixes, set the tone for KKR's innings, while Rana's composed batting provided valuable momentum. Andre Russell's quickfire 24 off 14 deliveries, along with contributions from Rinku Singh and Ramandeep Singh towards the end, further bolstered KKR's score.MI's opener, Ishan Kishan, launched a spirited attack with five fours and two sixes, including an inventive switch-hit boundary off Sunil Narine. Despite Kishan's aggressive start and MI's strong position of 59/0 in five overs, Narine and Harshit Rana orchestrated MI's downfall with clever bowling tactics, ultimately turning the tide in KKR's favour.Varun Chakravarthy 's 2 wickets helped him maintain his third position with 18 wickets, while Jasprit Bumrah's two crucial wickets for MI saw him reclaim the IPL 2024 purple cap with 20 wickets.In the 60th IPL match, Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) displayed resilience against Mumbai Indians (MI).

IPL playoff scenarios: Which team will join Kolkata Knight Riders in top two?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/ipl-playoff-scenarios-which-team-will-join-kolkata-knight-riders-in-top-two/articleshow/110098805.cms,"*

Gujarat Titans became the third team to be knocked out of the Indian Premier League playoff race after their game against Kolkata Knight Riders was washed out on Monday.We look at the chances of the teams in contention: KKR now have a 75% chance of finishing sole toppers and a 25% chance of ending up in sole second spot, assuming no more matches get rained off.If they win their last game, they will top. They could top even if they lose their last game, provided RR don't win both their remaining games.RR are not sure of topping even if they win their remaining games, but their chances of being sole toppers are a respectable 25%. They also have a nearly 40% chance of finishing sole second. But they are still not guaranteed qualification. If they lose both games, they could end up tied second with three other teams - SRH CSK and LSG depending on results in other games.Third placed CSK have a better than 90% chance of making the top four on points, singly or jointly, but their qualification is far from certain. They could end up tied second with three other teams (RR, SRH and LSG) or tied third with up to four other teams or tied for fourth with three other teams. What helps is their better net run rate at this stage than any of the other teams competing for the last two qualifying slots. Also, a loss against RCB in their last game will not necessarily rule them out.Fourth placed SRH have an even better chance (96.9%) of making it to the top four slots on points, singly or jointly, thanks to the extra game in hand. But they too are unsure of qualification with the possibility of four-way ties for second, five-way ties for third or three-way ties for fourth looming. The good news is that they don't have to necessarily win both their remaining games.Fifth placed RCB's chances of making it to the top four spots on points, singly or jointly, are just above 40%. Their last game against CSK is a must-win, but even winning it is not enough. Other results will need to go their way.Sixth placed DC's chances of finishing among the top four on points, singly or jointly, are barely over 31%. And if they lose to LSG, the best they can hope for is sixth.For seventh placed LSG, the game against DC is not a must-win because they have another game in hand. The bad news, however, is that despite a 56% chance of making the top four slots on points, they are looking at possible ties with up to three teams for second, up to four teams for third and up to three teams for fourth and their NRR is the worst among all the teams they could tie with.Monday's washed out game effectively ended GT 's slim chances of qualification, making them the third team after MI and PBKS to get knocked out.",Gujarat Titans are the third team to be knocked out of the Indian Premier League playoff race.

Batting as an opener, the 'Player of the Match' smashed a 46-ball 75 not out as the visitors chased down a challenging 193 for 7 posted by Ireland, who had stunned Pakistan by winning the opening match by five wickets.Pakistan's run-chase got off to a horror start as opener Saim Ayub (6) and skipper Babar Azam (0) fell early, leaving the visitor at 13 for 2 in the second over. Rizwan then launched a counter-attack along wish Fakhar Zaman, who hit a stroke-filled 78 off 40 balls.They added 140 runs for third wicket to script Pakistan's seven-wicket win. Wicketkeeper Azam Khan made a swashbuckling 30 not out off 10 balls.Speaking at the post-match presentation after the match, Rizwan made an honest admission about the influence of Indian batting legend Kohli on the Pakistan batsmen.Rizwan's response came when he was asked about Kohli and him being the only two batters to average above 50 in T20Is.""We have learnt a lot of things from Virat Kohli; I respect him,"" said Rizwan.Kohli averages 51.75 in T20Is, having scored 4037 runs in 109 innings at a strike rate of 138.15. Rizwan, on the other hand, averages 50.38 in T20Is for his 3124 runs in 82 innings, which have come at a strike rate of 127.92.About the match and his partnership with Zaman, Rizwan said: ""It was not an easy chase because the Ireland bowlers knew their conditions better. They gave us difficult time early on, but we decided that chasing 194, we have to attack. You're always in pressure when you lose, especially with (T20) World Cup around the corner.""The T20 World Cup is scheduled for June 2 to 29 in the US and West Indies. India and Pakistan are in the same group and will face-off in New York on June 9.The decisive third T20I between Pakistan and Ireland will be played on May 14, after which the Babar Azam-led squad will leave for England where they will play four T20Is before flying off to the US for the T20 World Cup.","Pakistan beat Ireland by seven wickets to level three-match series at 1-1.

NEW DELHI: Barcelona reclaimed the second spot in LaLiga by securing a 2-0 victory against Real Sociedad at their home ground on Monday. The goals came from Lamine Yamal 's strike in the first half and a penalty converted by Raphinha in the closing stages of the match.With this win, Xavi Hernandez's team moved up to 76 points, surpassing Girona , who drew 2-2 against Alaves on Friday.However, Real Madrid have already clinched the league title, sitting comfortably at 90 points with only three games remaining.Inigo Martinez , a Barcelona defender, acknowledged the challenges ahead in an interview with Movistar, stating, ""There is still a long way to go. It will be a battle to the end. Girona are very strong."" He also emphasized the importance of the victory, saying, ""It's in our hands now. I think the team is very good. Three valuable points. We had some mistakes in the first half. In the second half I think we could have finished it off earlier.""The opening goal came from the 16-year-old sensation Yamal, who calmly finished from Ilkay Gundogan 's pass following a swift counterattack. This marked his fifth goal in LaLiga this season. Yamal expressed his thoughts on the game, saying, ""It was an important game to regain second place and we have to try to make it a nine-point week,"" referring to the upcoming fixtures. He also praised his team's performance, stating, ""Real did very well in the first half but then we were able to improve.

Despite the difficulties, Xavi expressed satisfaction with his team's performance, concluding, ""It's an important victory for us. We played a good game in general.""",Barcelona beat Real Sociedad 2-0 to reclaim second place in LaLiga. Goals from Lamine Yamal and Raphinha sealed the win for Xavi's team.

IPL 2024: How Virat Kohli has symbolised RCB's resurgence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/ipl-2024-how-rcb-rediscovered-the-groove-to-bounce-back/articleshow/110100120.cms,"Stars and performances align as team notches five wins on the trot

BENGALURU: Over the past two weeks, performances, stars and luck have aligned perfectly for Royal Challengers Bengaluru , who have won five consecutive matches to stay afloat in the Indian Premier League . A 47-run win against Delhi Capitals on Sunday helped them jump to the fifth position on the points table, with their final match - a big-ticket home contest against Chennai Super Kings next weekend being decisive.On Sunday it seemed even the weather in Bengaluru wanted to play its part in RCB's run of luck. While heavy rain lashed many parts of the city before the match, the cloud cover did not open above the M Chinnaswamy stadium until a couple of hours after RCB had sealed their win.Faf du Plessis and his men's campaign has been divided into two parts. In the first, where they lost seven of their outings, RCB had just one close contest-losing by a solitary run to Kolkata Knight Riders . Most of the matches in this phase was highlighted by erratic bowling, misfiring batters, their massive investments at the auction backfiring and team strategies which were baffling.But the tide turned on April 25, when their bowlers defended 206 for a 35-run victory against Sunrisers Hyderabad . The win also marked the return to form of Cameron Green (2/23 in four overs), their Rs 17.5-crore indulgence during the transfer window. On Sunday, Green, the man of the match again, played a pivotal role with an unbeaten 24-ball 32 and four over during which he went for a measly 19 runs and picked up a wicket.After the halfway mark, the coaching staff headed by Andy Flower, a man with a T20 winning reputation, have been able to turn the assembly of stars and domestic players into a team which performs in unison. While Virat Kohli , with 661 runs, has continued with his purple patch, Rajat Patidar, who has been pushed down the batting order, has adjusted to his middle-order role. Resting an awfully out of form Glenn Maxwell has freed up a foreigner slot which has been used wisely. On that count Will Jacks has been a good value-add.With no spinner of pedigree in the line-up Karn Sharma was an option, while 33-year-old Swapnil Singh hadn't inspired confidence. But in the 2.0 version of the Bengaluru-based franchise, the left-arm spinner has opened bowling with confidence.Summing up his team's journey, Green later said, ""This year there has been so many high scores.""Elaborating further, skipper Du Plessis said, ""The first of the season, things didn't quite come together. Now, from a batting and bowling perspective we have been able to put it together. A lot of work has gone behind the scenes, and we are getting it right and I feel there is a lot more variety in our bowling now. Yash (Dayal) and Lockie (Ferguson) have been exceptional the last few games. We want to play a style of cricket which is bold and put some performances together and keep going.""Although RCB's qualification hinges on a big win against CSK and the performance of Sunrisers Hyderabad and Lucknow Super Giants, their comeback will be the biggest positive for the team this season.",Royal Challengers Bengaluru have won five consecutive matches to stay afloat in the Indian Premier League. A 47-run win against Delhi Capitals on Sunday helped them jump to the fifth position on the points table.

KL Rahul-Goenka episode a storm in an espresso cup: Justin Langer,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/kl-rahul-goenka-episode-a-storm-in-an-espresso-cup-justin-langer/articleshow/110094103.cms,"(LSG) head coach Justin Langer talks about the changing dynamics of the game, the all-encompassing role of the modern coach and how real stardom is still an elusive quest for the typical

cricketer...

Read on…

This is your first coaching stint in the IPL. How difficult is it to be a coach these days, especially in such high-profile franchises?

Coaching staff in teams have ballooned since your playing days…

In franchise cricket, the money rolls in fast. Superstars are made very easily. Do you think ego then becomes a big issue for players?

There is a perception players’ heads get turned by so much money floating around, with so many brands chasing you…

If we look at the greatest cricket teams of the past, there’s always an inherently strong sense of team bonding. How do you create that in a franchise environment, with so many different players from all over?

How does Australia invariably rise to the occasion in World Cups?

How do you handle the fear of failure?

How important is it to take care of the mental health of players who are always such pressure?

What impact will this season’s IPL have on the upcoming World Cup? Teams are scoring heavily this season…

Who are your favourites for the T20 WC?

The Indian coach’s position is up for grabs. Will you apply?

What is it like to face a fast bowler, say like Shoaib Akhtar?

Do you miss the Pakistan team of the past – tough and competitive?

Recently in the eye of what he termed “a storm in an espresso cup,” Justin Langer, head coach of the LSG, seemed in awe of cricket’s evolution from a one-coach-one-physio endeavour in his early playing days to the heaving 90-man entourages of the IPL today.Sitting back in his chair at a plush city hotel and gesticulating with his eyes and hands while speaking, Langer’s train of thought veered from past to present and onward to the future.The one-time foot soldier of the formidable Australian team of the 1990s is one of the sharpest cricketing brains around, and he was excitedly pouring his thoughts out on the game. The TOI Sports team just happened to be present.When you’re a player, you have control. You take absolute responsibility for your performance. The only thing that's out of your control is selection, or what the media writes or what people think of you. You focus only on watching the ball. If you make runs, the only currency of value is runs. If you make runs, you get selected. If you get selected, you get a contract.I went straight from playing to coaching – as an assistant coach, which is the best coach job in the world. You work about two hours a day, everyone's your best friend, and you’ve got no accountability. Then you become head coach, oh man, then you work about 16 hours a day. No one likes you. And you’ve got 100% accountability!I took a break from coaching for two and a half years for the first time in my life (after the Australia stint). I had do my writing, my speaking, I did my board roles. I had complete control. It's like being a batsman, again, there's freedom in that.And then I came back into coaching. And you realise again that you've got your hands tied. In football, the coach has control over the match. Whereas in cricket, the captain does everything on the field, right? So, you manage your people, you make them feel happy, you make them ready to play, you help them with peak performance, you help the superstar and the kid who's just coming in.You’ve to mentor them and coach them differently. But you must understand they are all different people – some introverts, some extroverts. You have got to learn how to manage. So as head coach, you are purely a man manager. You have to manage them well so that they perform on the field. And that's tough.When I started playing with the Australian cricket team, Bob Simpson was the coach. When I started playing professional cricket, we used to train on a Wednesday afternoon, we all had full-time jobs. We had one coach who was part time, and I think we had a physio, and you only got paid if you made the first 11.Now there are coaches everywhere. Things have changed. It’s a 12-month business. We have three different formats of the game which guys play all year round. Now they play in different franchises, they play international cricket. Yes, times have changed. But there's still a role for an assignment, right? We call it professionalism. We try to look after people well.Let’s face it. There wasn't an IPL when Ian Chappell was around. There were no franchises. There were no broadcast rights. If we expect the players to be high-performing individuals, then they expect high-performing services and that comes in the form of coaches and physiotherapists and doctors and people who throw balls all day.I worked full time in a bank, or in a stock broking firm until I was 28 years old. Then Middlesex rang me and asked if I wanted to go and play. I played three years at Middlesex and then I became a full-time cricketer.In the Australian team I played in, we had Matthew Hayden, Shane Warne, Glen McGrath, Ricky Ponting. They were superstar players because of their performance, not because of how much money they made. One of the challenges we have today is that we still judge players on the performance, not on how much money they get paid.There's so much money in the game. But you still have to be a high performer. MS Dhoni is MS Dhoni not because he's made a lot of money.My point is that Dhoni, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli and KL Rahul are incredibly wealthy, but they are superstars because of the way they perform. Dhoni won a World Cup and was one of the greatest finishers of the game. People will never forget those performances.In India, with 1.4 billion cricket-loving people, you could pick five teams which can beat most countries. There's so much talent. I’m blown away. So my point is, I also see how much pressure these young players are under because I they all want to be a Dhoni, they all want to be a Virat Kohli or Rahul or Rohit. But they’ve got a long journey to get to that point. The only way they can survive here is by performing and performing and performing.When I went to the IPL mini-auction, I saw several players going unsold. There are lot more heartbreaks than success. For the ones who make it, there is a lot of money in the game. That’s just the joys of the money from broadcast rights. But the ones who make it must be very good cricketers. They're the cream rising to the top.Yeah, they might be getting the brands, and they might be doing the rounds of social media. But if they don't perform, they get destroyed. They either get dropped or get destroyed by social media. So, the pressure, in some way, balances it all out.When I played my third Test, the great Allan Border gave me some amazing advice. I still give it to the players today. He was wearing expensive, branded shoes and I asked him if he could help me get a shoe sponsorship. He told me, you make all the runs in the world, you become the best batsman and you will get all the shoes, or the sunglasses or the fame or the money you could ever imagine. Focus on that. Nothing's changed.Shane Warne turned up for the first session with Bob Simpson – peroxide hair, earring, a mobile phone in one hand and a packet of cigarettes in the other. These guys were like, who’s this young upstart? But he was real. And he performed so well he was great. All these kids now say Shane loved fast cars, loved women, loved smoking cigarettes. But he was brilliant. He made a lot of mistakes off the field, but he was a great performer. We miss him.It’s a challenge when you're here only for 10 weeks. This is why I really admire Chennai. They have a solid foundation, the same Stephen Fleming’s (head coach) been there since Day One, I think. I respect that. They've won five times. Let's face it, Lucknow Super Giants is a very young franchise. It's still a work in progress.I imagine what we're all striving for is when players come to their franchise, it's like coming home.Tom Moody told me IPL is like the Olympics, you've never seen anything like it.From my experience of four years with the Australian team, I can say building an international team it is exhausting. It is tough. If you don't perform, the whole country lets you know about it. And that is exhausting, right?The hardest thing about being head coach in Australia is selection. If you a player from one state, the other state complains. International cricket is not like franchise cricket.We only play six months of the year, but you have the full pre-season. You build up the family, you build up the culture and you build up all these inputs over 12 months. It is very tiring.When you play cricket for Australia, the expectation is you're going to win because we win. That might sound very simplistic, but this is the Aussie mindset.In IPL, there is so much pressure to win. Then there's pressure just to be in the team. When we started winning, then suddenly there was this load of expectations. You could feel the pressure building.In contrast, we Australians just go with the flow, stay relaxed. It's about having fun. And they know they've got so much talent on the park. They just go about their business. They are used to winning. They are used to doing it their way. It is like, we don't take it too seriously, even though we take it very seriously. It's almost like a paradox. That's the secret.When you walk into the Australian dressing room, it’s like being in a nightclub 24/7, I'm not joking. It was so much fun. We had so much respect for each other, and it was so much fun. And that's the difference.If the pressure builds, you’ll never perform at your best. And I know that as a player. The harder you try, the worse it gets. And in big games, if things tighten up, you're dead. But if you just stay relaxed…. my heroes were the West Indies, the early West Indies team I watched while growing up. Like Viv Richards, they just seemed so chilled out all the time. They knew they were talented.I'm sure individuals think about the fear of failure. I lived with it until I was 28 years old. And it is paralysing, the fear of failure. It can drive you, but living in a world of fear of failure is a dangerous world.We are human beings. I remember seeing Steve Waugh suffer that. He was a run machine but had got a duck. He was going through a small run of failures. I remember he got out just before stumps in Johannesburg and got in the bus after that — he had his collar up, had his cap down and wore sunglasses. I went and sat with him. I said, ‘How’re you feeling, captain?’ He goes, ‘Pretty rubbish.’ So, even the greats have doubts and insecurities. That's being human, right?There is more acceptance now. I respected Glenn Maxwell for coming out a couple of years ago and say he had mental-health issues. I see guys like Will Pucovski . He is a supreme talent, but he's got issues. He suffered from concussion. Yeah, so the concussion is one thing, but that is also linked with some mental-health issues.We are human, we all are on a spectrum of mental health. And it’s just about dealing with that. It is about man management, knowing that everyone has to look after their mental health every single day of their lives. That's one thing about being a coach, you got to keep observing all the time. And you can see it in their body language, you can see it in the way they perform, you can see about in their actions, you can see it in all these things.As the head coach, you got to be like a father, like a school teacher, be a psychologist, be a mentor. All these things rolled up in one. In IPL, the team entourage comprises 90 people. You have to deal with 50 people who are all trying to do the same thing. And they're all on their own journeys in life to get to winning. That is a huge challenge.I'm fascinated by the impact-player rule. That's had an effect. I'm on the MCC world cricket committee and one important thing we talk about is the cricket pitches. You want Test cricket to survive, get the pitches right.Like it’s a contest between bat and ball in Australia. The ball swings around and bounces. Awesome. You come to India and the ball spins, contest between bat and ball. You can't leave the screen because the batsman could get out any ball. It is addictive.At the upcoming World Cup, it will all depend on what the pitches are like. I can't imagine that the wickets in the West Indies are going to be that flat, maybe Barbados. I've got no idea what's going to happen in America because they're drop-in pitches.My belief has always been that we should never forget about the defensive side of T20 cricket . You look at the teams doing really well in this in this IPL, like KKR and Rajasthan Royals. They have good bowlers and so are performing well. Never forget the defensive side of the game. LSG has suffered because a lot of our bowlers dropped out before the league began.So, when it comes to the World Cup, often the teams with the best bowling attacks will have the best chance to win.If you if you look at the trend of World Cups, it's often the same group of teams on paper. There's a lot of very good teams. India will obviously be strong. Australia on paper look scarily strong. New Zealand always are the underdogs. They love playing for their country, so they are strong. It is tough to predict at the start of the season who's going to win. There might be some injuries. It is impossible to predict.(After a laugh and a long pause) Well, I am curious. I've never ever thought about it. I have deep respect for any international coach because I understand the pressure, but coaching the Indian team would be an extraordinary role. From what I've seen with the amount of talent I've seen in this country, it would be fascinating.If you are facing fast bowlers, you’ve got to have physical courage. The second thing is, if you see the ball come out of the bowler’s hand, it's like slow motion. All I tried to do was getting my stance right and have proper balance. If you can see the ball released out of the bowler’s fingers, then everything will be okay. It’s then very hard to get out.You see the ball release because you have hit so many cricket balls. It doesn't matter how quick it is. But if your stance is just a little bit out and you start falling across or you're moving at release of the ball, it is like living in a fast-forward movie cartoon. And that's when you get hit on the body and then it's not fun.Yeah, just as we miss a competitive West Indies team. I grew up watching the great West Indies team. You want to see them strong, and you want to see all the other countries strong. We talk about this in the MCC world cricket committee meeting regularly. How do we keep sustaining the health of the other countries? It’s important to have West Indies strong, as important to keep Pakistan strong and as important to keep New Zealand and Sri Lanka strong because that is important for the health of world cricket.",LSG head coach Justin Langer talks about the changing dynamics of the game. Langer also discusses the all-encompassing role of the modern coach. He also discusses how real stardom is still an elusive quest for the typical cricket player.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110099050,imgsize-44010,width-400,resizemode-4/110099050.jpg"

I think this IPL has been exceptionally tough for him because we've kept losing wickets at stages which hasn't allowed him to kick on where he likes. He probably feels like he's always having to rebuild.""I think as a batting unit around KL, we haven't been as good as we should. It's just been extremely tough conditions for him. That's something we've chatted about as well -- we've just kept losing wickets at tough times.""However, Klusener said a big knock from Rahul was just around the corner.""Then batters coming in, seem to have to be rebuilding the whole time and not just coming into a platform. So, I think by KL's standards, he probably would have liked to have kicked on in a few more games.""Probably (he) would have liked to have at least one or two hundreds that haven't worked out for him. But there's still a couple of games left. He's in a good space. So, we've got our fingers crossed again for him,"" he said.LSG bowling unit was at the receiving end of a brutal onslaught from SRH openers Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma, who racked up a record 167 in 9.4 overs.""By the bowling unit's high standards, they didn't execute as well as they would have liked to on that surface and then you mix in two players who played absolutely beautifully and quite often that ends in a poor result for the team that doesn't bring their best skills,"" Klusener said.""It was just a mix of some exceptionally hard batting and I don't think we executed our skills as well as we should have and you mix that together, it doesn't normally end well.""LSG are currently at the seventh spot with 12 points, making the remaining two games a must-win contest to keep their slim playoff hopes alive.""I think we've been just a little bit inconsistent by our own high standards. We just need to deal with the fact of where we are now and make sure that we become consistent.""As a team, we want to win the IPL, we probably need to win five in a row, which I think RCB has just done five in a row.""So that's just proved that for us it's absolutely possible, but that's just the big picture.

If CSK loses against RCB then they'll have to make sure that RCB does not chase the target within 18.1 overs or win the match by 18 runs or more.LSG and GT can secure a direct entry into the playoffs with 16 points if they win their next two matches, provided RCB defeats CSK and SRH loses its remaining matches. However, any loss will make it challenging for them to bounce back due to their negative run rate.SRH, with fourteen points and two matches remaining, can solidify their playoff berth thanks to their superior run rate. If SRH loses both matches, it opens up a chance for both CSK and RCB to qualify for the playoffs provided RCB defeats CSK.","Defending champion Chennai Super Kings remain in contention for the playoffs after beating Rajasthan Royals by five wickets.

NEW DELHI: Delhi Capitals ' Director of Cricket, Sourav Ganguly , highlighted the significant impact of Rishabh Pant , the team's skipper, on their batting lineup. Ganguly suggested that Pant's absence was a contributing factor to DC 's loss against Royal Challengers Bengaluru ( RCB ) on Sunday.RCB's remarkable resurgence in the latter half of the season continued with their fifth consecutive victory, propelling them to the fifth position in the standings.Their convincing 47-run win over DC at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru showcased their determination to keep their playoff aspirations alive.Having initially struggled with seven losses in the first eight league games, RCB's impressive turnaround underscores their resilience and determination to succeed in the tournament.Speaking to the media ahead of their final league game against Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) at Delhi's Arun Jaitley Stadium scheduled for Wednesday, Ganguly said to the media, ""Yesterday yes (if DC lost because of Pant's absence), Rishabh makes a big difference to our batting.""Pant, the captain of Delhi Capitals, faced a fine of Rs 30 lakh and a one-match suspension due to his team's slow over-rate during their match against Rajasthan Royals in the ongoing Indian Premier League.This incident marks the third time Pant has been penalized for maintaining a slow over-rate in the IPL. While he received fines for the first two offenses, the breach of the IPL Code of Conduct for the third time led to his suspension for one match.Despite this setback, Pant has showcased outstanding form in the IPL, amassing 413 runs in 12 matches at an impressive average of 41.30, including three half-centuries. His explosive batting style is reflected in his strike rate of 156.43, with his highest score being an unbeaten 88 runs.Ganguly also expressed optimism that Indian skipper Rohit Sharma , who is currently facing a decline in form for Mumbai Indians (MI) in the ongoing IPL, will play well in the T20 World Cup .""India is a very good team. Rohit will play well in the World Cup. He plays well in big tournaments. At the big stage, he will be fine,"" said Ganguly.Rohit in the ongoing season, has scored 349 runs in 13 innings at an average of 29.08, with a century and strike rate of 145.41. The last few matches have not been good for Rohit, scoring just 52 runs in the last six innings.Ganguly also expressed that star batter Virat Kohli should open for the team in the WC.In the ongoing IPL season, Virat is the Orange Cap holder for most runs, making 661 runs at an average of 66.10 and a strike rate of 155.16, with a century and five fifties. His best score is 113*.RCB, who has made a remarkable comeback in the tournament with five successive wins after a horrid win-loss record of 1-6 in the first half, will need Virat to be at his best against Chennai Super Kings (CSK) in their final league game at Bengaluru on May 18 for a chance at playoffs.","Delhi Capitals Director of Cricket, Sourav Ganguly, says Rishabh Pant makes a big difference to the team's batting. Ganguly says Pant's absence was a contributing factor to DC's loss against Royal Challengers Bengaluru ( RCB ) on Sunday. RCB's remarkable resurgence in the latter half of the season continued with their fifth consecutive victory.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110093925,imgsize-64676,width-400,resizemode-4/110093925.jpg"

Despite being 41 years old, Anderson, renowned for his fitness and pace, announced his departure via Instagram on Saturday, stating that the first Test of the summer against West Indies on July 10 would mark his final appearance for England.Roach, currently competing in the County Championship for Surrey, acknowledged Anderson's greatness and expressed sadness at his impending departure. He expressed his desire for West Indies to secure their first away series win against England since 1988, highlighting the strength of their pace attack with players like Shamar Joseph and Alzarri Joseph.Furthermore, Kemar Roach emphasized Anderson's valuable advice and widespread respect within the cricketing community.""It is a very highly talented and skilful group (West Indies pace group),"" Roach said at the Kia Oval on Monday as quoted by ESPNCricinfo.""We have not had the best of times over here in England, so it is more about focusing on us - not what they are going to do for him (England doing a farewell Test for Anderson). He is going to get what he deserves (Anderson). But it is all about us working hard to get what we deserve, which is a series win over here in England.""""He is a great fast bowler, probably one of the greatest. It is sad to see him go, but we all know you cannot play forever. He has done fantastically for England and he deserves whatever he gets.""""First Test match against us... hopefully, we ruin it. He is highly respected. He has always given me great advice as well. He will go down as one of the greatest to ever do it. I wish him all the best after that Test match, and hopefully, he enjoys whatever comes next,"" he concluded.Kemar also believes that the WI seam attack consisting of Shamar, him, Alzarri and Jayden Seales is among the best he has played in and they together add a lot of X-Factor with their devastating pace.""To have three guys like that in the team, a captain to have that to select, for any given day or any given surface [is great]. As a group, we are pretty confident. England is always our biggest series... We want to put up a good fight, put on a good show. We have not won a Test series in England for quite a while so it is good to come with some confidence, and hopefully, we can do it this time,"" he added.Roach, who is turning 36 next month and is 15 years into his Test career, said that he is not contemplating retirement as of now. He spent the past two weeks with bowling coach Jade Dernbach working on his ""balance at the crease"" and discovered his prodigious reverse swing.""I felt good. It has been a tough couple of weeks for me, trying to work on some things, but it is always good to get rewards for some hard work. As a fast bowler, you always want to see the stumps flying around. I am building with Surrey. [I want to] get myself in good physical shape, the right mental space, and then when it gets to the West Indies tour, I will build on that.""""I have no retirement time in sight. I think I can go as long as I want, but obviously it is all on performances. The older you get, you need to have performance to stay in the team. I have been doing well, but I just want to keep helping the youngsters so they are in a good space, mentally and physically. I will be happy to see those guys going after me and breaking those records if they have to,"" he concluded.",West Indies pacer Kemar Roach expressed admiration for England's pace veteran James Anderson.

"Virat Kohli shows intent in strike rate, spin game in second half of IPL 2024",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/virat-kohli-shows-intent-in-strike-rate-spin-game-in-second-half-of-ipl-2024/articleshow/110091478.cms,"(With inputs from ANI)

NEW DELHI: Royal Challengers Bengaluru star Virat Kohli consistently showcased his prowess in this IPL as a T20 player, despite the contrasting opinions of fans, cricket pundits, and former players.His incredible performances serve as a positive reinforcement for Team India in anticipation of the upcoming ICC T20 World Cup 2024.The ICC's cricketing extravaganza, scheduled to commence from June 1, will be jointly hosted by the West Indies and the USA.Kohli's solid form in the IPL instills confidence in the Indian team's prospects as they prepare to compete on the global stage.Continuing his fine run with the bat and indicating that he can hit big from ball one if needed, Virat played a solid knock of 27 in just 13 balls against Delhi Capitals (DC) on Sunday. His knock had a four and three massive sixes and a strike rate of over 207. A huge part of this knock was his back-and-forth with compatriot and pacer Ishant Sharma, someone who has been around Virat since his academy days. Both exchanged jokes, shared laughs and tried to get one-up on each other before a fine delivery by Ishant was nicked by Virat straight into the hands of wicketkeeper Abhishek Porel.In the ongoing season, Virat is the Orange Cap holder for most runs, making 661 runs at an average of 66.10 and a strike rate of 155.16, with a century and five fifties. His best score is 113*. RCB , who has made a remarkable comeback in the tournament with five successive wins after a horrid win-loss record of 1-6 in the first half, will need Virat to be at his best against Chennai Super Kings (CSK) in their final league game at Bengaluru on May 18 for a chance at playoffs.Often being questioned on his strike rate, Virat has swung back at his critics in his signature fashion, ditching boundaries in favour of huge sixes and passing verbal jabs at naysayers during post-inning or match presentations.In the first six games of the tournament, Virat scored well at a healthy strike rate. He made 319 runs in his first six innings in 225 balls at a strike rate of 141.77. 29 fours and 12 sixes came from Virat's bat, marking a ratio of 5.4 balls per boundary. He was forced to play the anchor and attacker at the same time as other batters around him struggled for form and rhythm. Virat scored a century and two fifties in these six innings.The switch flipped in Virat's batting when they were tasked with chasing 288 runs against Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) in their seventh game. Though RCB faced a 25-run loss despite a valiant effort, Virat scored 42 in 20 balls, with six fours and two sixes. His strike rate was 210.00.Since that SRH game, fans have experienced a different Virat. In these next seven innings, Virat scored 342 runs in just 201 balls, with a strike rate going up to a massive 170.14. 27 fours and 21 sixes have come from his bat in these seven innings starting from that SRH game. The balls per boundary ratio has also come down, with 4.1 balls taken to smash one.An unnoticed positive of Virat's remarkable run is his six-hitting. He has smashed a total of 33 sixes so far, the second-highest by a batter next to SRH's Abhishek Sharma (35 sixes). Virat has more sixes than Sunil Narine (32), Travis Head, Heinrich Klaasen and Riyan Parag (31), Australian sensation Jake Fraser McGurk and Shivam Dube (28), Rajat Patidar (27) and Rishabh Pant (25).This is the only second time Virat has crossed 30 sixes in a single season of IPL, with his highest peak coming in 2016, when he smashed 38 sixes in 16 games. He has one more league game atleast to add more to his tally.Since that Sunrisers game, Virat's strike rate against spin, something considered his weakness, has also gone up. In his first six IPL 2024 innings, Virat scored 128 runs in 98 balls against spin, with only four boundaries and seven sixes coming from his bat. He played 28 dot balls against spin and his SR against spin was 130.61.However, that SRH inning during the chase of 287 runs, sparked a change in his spin game as well. From that knock onwards, Virat has smashed 132 runs in 90 balls against spin, with 11 fours and six sixes coming from his bat. His strike rate also increased to 146.66 against spin and he played 26 dots against the moving ball.Virat's overall strike rate against spin in this IPL is 138.29, with 260 runs hit in 188 balls against spin. He has smashed 13 sixes against spin and 15 boundaries. He has played 54 dot balls against spinners.In the past five seasons, Virat's overall SR against spin has been: 113.46, 108.08, 100.00, 108.91 and 130.14. His strike rate against spin was at its best in the 2016 season, where he struck at 152.30 and 2015 season, where he scored his runs at 151.21 against spin bowling.Following his match-winning knock of 92 in just 47 balls against Punjab Kings recently on May 9, Virat had spoken about being more attacking in his approach, bringing out slog sweeps against spinners after a long-time and the idea of self-improvement.""For me, it is still quality over quantity (on his runs and numbers). More so now, at this stage of my career, heading into 36. The understanding of my game over so many years allows me to practice less, and still stay mentally switched on. And some added challenges in terms of improving your own game. Certain aspects of the game, you want to get better at. It's an ever-evolving process. I am not a guy who wants to sit around saying 'this is the way I play' and not improve on the things I need to,"" said Kohli.Kohli further explained about his slog-sweep shot against the spinners.""I brought out the slog-sweep to the spinners. It was me mentally putting myself in that situation. I did not practice that at all. I know I can hit it because I have played that shot a lot in the past. So I just felt like I needed to take a bit more risk and for me, that shot was something that I used to hit regularly back in the days. That shot is now allowing me to hit off the backfoot as well. I am always looking to expose that side of the field against the spin. It's been a massive factor for me in the IPL,"" the right-hand batter added.""It just takes a bit more conviction and put out that thought that props up 'what if I get out?'. I have been managing to stay ahead of that thought. And that has allowed me to keep my strike rate up in the middle overs and scoring for my team as well,"" the Delhi-born player concluded.This refreshed approach of Virat in T20 cricket, especially against spinners, could just be what India needs on slow surfaces of the Caribbean and it would be interesting if Virat would carry forward his form to the World Cup.","Royal Challengers Bengaluru star Virat Kohli continues fine run with the bat. Virat scored 27 in just 13 balls against Delhi Capitals (DC) on Sunday. Kohli is the Orange Cap holder for most runs, making 661 runs.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110091419,imgsize-89448,width-400,resizemode-4/110091419.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Former India captain and chief selector Dilip Vengsarkar emphasized the importance of aspiring youngsters setting their sights on playing and excelling in Test cricket . According to him, achieving success in the traditional format brings genuine honour to players.Vengsarkar pointed out that in today's times, parents might be tempted by the fame and financial rewards associated with success in T20 leagues.However, he stressed that the primary focus of young players should remain on excelling in red-ball cricket. Mastering this format not only brings true recognition but also lays a solid foundation for success in other formats of the game.""Parents are overawed with the success of IPL , its teams and players,"" Vengsarkar said in Mumbai at an event to launch cricket coach Jwala Singh 's book, titled Pathway to Cricketing Excellence and Beyond.Vengsarkar, who also served as a former chief selector and is credited for bringing Virat Kohli into the national team, emphasised that while parents may lean towards training their children to become batters, it's crucial to recognise the equal importance of bowlers regardless of the format.""The bowlers also have a big role to play not just in the IPL but also Test cricket, they can be match-winners. Try to play Test cricket for your country, if you are a good Test cricketer you can play other formats of the game,"" he said.""You will be rated only by what you have done for the country in Test cricket. IPL is a good format, it is good entertainment and it also meets the finances, which is also very important but Test match cricket is the ultimate,"" Vengsarkar added.Jwala, renowned for mentoring India batter Yashasvi Jaiswal from a young age, emphasised the pivotal role of parents and the significance of having the right coaches in a player's development journey.""When you play any sport there are three pillars, one is the player, and the second is the parents and third is the coach. It has to be a combined effort of all three and that is what this book is about,"" Jwala said while giving insights into his book which he has co-authored with Sreekar Mothukuri.""The parents, today, they watch the IPL and so much media (attention) and the (overall) outcome, they think their child would become a cricketer and he will earn a lot of money and fame. But that is not the way to play a sport,"" added Jwala, who has also coached India batter Prithvi Shaw .The coach said if a child is passionate enough, he should be given a certain number of years to harness it.""If any of the parents are thinking that, it is absolutely wrong. If a child has passion (for the sport) and it continues for (a number of) years, that is how it will work out,"" he added.",Dilip Vengsarkar says aspiring youngsters should set their sights on Test cricket.

NEW DELHI: Kylian Mbappe , playing his final home game for Paris Saint-Germain , scored in a surprising 3-1 loss to Toulouse on the night PSG received the Ligue 1 trophy.Despite Mbappe's early goal, his 44th of the season across all competitions, Toulouse quickly equalized through Thijs Dallinga. PSG fielded a heavily rotated side following their Champions League semi-final exit to Borussia Dortmund , with Mbappe being the sole player to retain his place.Yann Gboho's stunning strike put Toulouse ahead in the second half, and Frank Magri sealed the victory in added time, handing PSG only their second league defeat this season and first in 27 matches since September.Mbappe, who confirmed his departure from PSG when his contract expires at the end of the season, is expected to join Real Madrid next. He leaves PSG as the club's all-time leading scorer with 256 goals since joining from Monaco in 2017 for a fee of 180 million euros ($194 million).PSG had already secured a record-extending 12th French title and their 10th in 12 years before the match against Toulouse. The celebrations following the game were intended to focus on their title triumph rather than serving as a specific tribute to Mbappe. PSG can still complete a domestic treble by winning the French Cup final against Lyon on May 25, having already claimed the Champions Trophy, France's equivalent of the Super Cup.In other Ligue 1 action, Monaco secured second place and direct qualification for next season's Champions League with a 2-0 victory at Montpellier. Lille moved into third, level on points with Brest, after a 2-1 win at Nantes, with Jonathan David scoring both goals. The top three teams in Ligue 1 qualify directly for the expanded 36-team Champions League, while the fourth-placed team enters the preliminary rounds.

The win virtually guarantees Atletico's place in the Champions League next season, as they now hold an eight-point lead over fifth-place Athletic Bilbao with only three games remaining.Despite dominating the match from the start, Atletico struggled to find a way past Celta's goalkeeper, Vicente Guaita, who made several impressive saves throughout the game.However, De Paul's moment of brilliance finally broke the deadlock, as he controlled a clearance on the edge of the box and unleashed a powerful volley into the top corner.""When I'm on the edge of the box I've got confidence and I know I have to finish the move so there's no counter-attack, I knew I'd hit it if it fell to me,"" De Paul told DAZN.The victory marked a significant milestone for Atletico's coach, Diego Simeone , who recorded his 400th win across all competitions.

NEW DELHI: Arsenal revived their hopes of clinching the Premier League title by overcoming their Old Trafford struggles with a hard-fought 1-0 victory over Manchester United on Sunday, propelling them back to the top of the table.Leandro Trossard 's goal in the 20th minute proved decisive as Arsenal secured only their second win in 17 away games at United, reclaiming the league summit by a single point.While Manchester City still control their fate in the title race with two matches remaining compared to Arsenal's one, Mikel Arteta 's side kept the pressure on the defending champions ahead of their crucial clash with Tottenham Hotspur .The defeat further compounded United's woes, diminishing their hopes of European competition next season.Despite showing more resilience than in their previous match against Crystal Palace, where they suffered a 4-0 loss, Erik ten Hag's side have struggled for consistency, winning just one of their last eight Premier League games.Arsenal's resurgence in 2024 has been remarkable, winning 15 and drawing one of their 17 league matches since the turn of the year. However, their victory at Old Trafford was far from convincing, as they battled stifling heat and a determined United side.United's injury woes and defensive vulnerabilities were exposed once again, with Casemiro's error leading to Trossard's decisive goal. The absence of key players like Bruno Fernandes only added to their struggles.Despite a spirited second-half display from United, Arsenal held firm defensively, securing their sixth clean sheet in their last seven away league games. United's late efforts, including Alejandro Garnacho's chance that hit the side-netting, were not enough to salvage a result.Arsenal's determination to see out the game was evident in their defensive resolve and tactical discipline, denying United any clear-cut opportunities to equalize.As the title race heads towards its conclusion, Arsenal's victory sets up an intriguing finale, with Manchester City still in control of their destiny.

NEW DELHI: Manchester United clinched their first Women's FA Cup title with a commanding 4-0 triumph over Tottenham Hotspur in the final on Sunday. Under the guidance of manager Marc Skinner , the team avenged their defeat in last year's final to Chelsea by putting on a dominant display.The match saw United assert their authority, with midfielder Ella Toone breaking the deadlock on the stroke of halftime with a spectacular strike.After the break, Rachel Williams extended their lead with a well-timed header, followed by two goals from Spanish forward Lucia Garcia , sealing a comprehensive victory.This triumph marks a significant milestone for Manchester United's women's team, who have steadily progressed since their reformation in 2018. Winning their first major trophy will undoubtedly serve as a source of pride and motivation for the players and staff alike as they continue to make strides in women's football.""Wembley is always special. Last year we spoke as a group and said 'one day that will be ours' and today's the day so I'm buzzing,"" said goalkeeper Mary Earps.The atmosphere at Wembley Stadium was electric on a sunny day, with a staggering 76,082 fans in attendance, including Manchester United's co-owner Avram Glazer and Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy. Despite the anticipation, the first half of the match produced few noteworthy chances, with the breakthrough coming in the second minute of stoppage time.It was England's Ella Toone who seized the moment, driving the ball forward and unleashing a powerful strike from outside the area that found the top corner of the net. This stunning goal gave Manchester United a crucial lead heading into halftime.Tottenham, appearing in their first-ever FA Cup final, struggled to pose any attacking threat throughout the match, failing to register a single shot on target. Their hopes were further dashed after the break as United's Rachel Williams, a former Spurs player who had previously won the FA Cup with Birmingham City, rose high to head in a free kick, extending United's lead.Spanish forward Lucia Garcia capitalized on a mistake from Tottenham goalkeeper Becky Spencer, intercepting a poor pass and slotting the ball into the net to make it 3-0 in the 57th minute. Garcia then secured her brace, and United's victory, with another goal in the 74th minute, this time via a deflection.This triumph comes as a bright spot in Manchester United's challenging season, where they have struggled in the league standings, currently sitting fifth. Winning the Women's FA Cup represents a significant achievement for the club and underscores their progress since reforming the women's team in 2018.""We don't like to admit it but it does mask over the issues we've had,"" goalscorer Williams, 36, told the BBC. ""We have had some ups and downs this year. That's for Marc (Skinner) and the backroom staff to be like 'right, this is what we have to do in the summer'.""We are going to have change things next year. We have had some injuries, three or four ACLs, at the start of the season.""That's football, teams go through transition. You have a good year, you have a dip.

NEW DELHI: Lionel Messi played the full 90 minutes in Inter Miami's 3-2 victory over Montreal on Saturday night, despite a brief injury scare in the first half. Benjamin Cremaschi scored the decisive goal in the 59th minute, helping Inter Miami secure their fifth straight Major League Soccer win after overcoming a two-goal deficit.Luis Suarez and Matías Rojas also found the back of the net for Inter Miami, while Jules-Anthony Vilsaint and Bryce Duke scored for Montreal (3-5-3).Inter Miami (8-2-3) stretched their unbeaten run to seven matches (5-0-2), even though Messi failed to score or assist for the first time in his nine MLS appearances this season. The team has a 7-0-2 record in those nine games, with one of their losses coming against Montreal in March when Messi was not playing.Messi experienced a concerning moment towards the end of the first half when he was fouled by George Campbell . The impact of the challenge caused Messi to fall to the ground, visibly in pain and clutching his left knee.Inter Miami's medical staff attended to Messi on the field, and after about two minutes, he got up and walked to the sideline. He was not substituted, allowing him to return to the game shortly after.Remarkably, the match dynamics shifted following Messi's injury scare. Inter Miami was trailing 2-0 when Messi got hurt, but the score was 2-1 when he returned, and they equalized moments after he re-entered the field. Rojas scored from a free kick that Messi would typically take, putting Inter Miami on the scoreboard. Suarez then tapped in a goal from a corner kick late in first-half stoppage time, becoming the third player in MLS history to score 11 goals in his first 800 minutes of a season.Cremaschi's go-ahead goal came when Rojas sent a ball into open space, and the young midfielder ran it down, nudging the ball just past two defenders and into the net for a 3-2 lead. Messi had two chances to extend the lead in the final minutes but narrowly missed both.The match attracted a sellout crowd of 19,619 spectators, with Montreal selling out its 15,000 season tickets for the first time since joining MLS in 2012, largely due to Messi's arrival in the league last summer. Messi has now scored in 31 countries throughout his career.",Lionel Messi played the full 90 minutes in Inter Miami's 3-2 victory over Montreal.

Fans may also have a final opportunity to see veteran midfielder Luka Modric in action, as his contract expires this summer.Looking ahead to the title celebrations, Ancelotti confirmed he would repeat his iconic celebration from the previous year's parade, complete with a cigar and sunglasses. Meanwhile, Granada captain Carlos Neva apologized to the fans for the team's poor performance throughout the season, saying, ""Thanks to the fans for being with us in this year in which we've done so badly, and sorry.""In other matches, Athletic Bilbao rescued a 2-2 draw against Osasuna but lost ground in the race for fourth place, trailing Atletico Madrid by five points with one more game played.

NEW DELHI: Kylian Mbappe confirmed on Friday his decision to depart from Paris Saint-Germain ( PSG ) at the conclusion of the current season. The French champions, who signed Mbappe from Monaco in 2017 for a staggering 180 million euros ($194 million), are expected to bid farewell to their star player as he likely moves to Real Madrid .""I wanted to announce to you all that it's my last year at Paris Saint-Germain.I will not extend and the adventure will come to an end in a few weeks,"" Mbappe, 25, said in a video posted on social media. ""I will play my last game at the Parc des Princes on Sunday.""PSG, owned by Qatar, have already clinched their 10th Ligue 1 title in the past 12 seasons and will be presented with the trophy following Sunday's match against Toulouse, their final home game of the campaign. However, the team's Champions League aspirations were dashed by Borussia Dortmund in the semi-finals, with a 1-0 home defeat sealing a surprising 2-0 aggregate loss. Consequently, Mbappe will not have the opportunity to bid farewell in the Champions League final at Wembley on June 1, and his seven-year tenure at PSG will conclude without having secured Europe's most prestigious club competition.Mbappe had privately informed PSG of his intention to leave when his contract expires at the end of the season back in February. Although he had not publicly confirmed his departure or his next destination, it is widely believed that he will join Real Madrid. Spanish media reports have suggested that Mbappe has already signed an agreement to join LaLiga champions in July once his PSG contract concludes.""It's a lot of emotions, many years where I had the chance and the great honour to be a member of the biggest French club, one of the best in the world,"" said Mbappe.""It allowed me to arrive here, to have my first experience in a club with a lot of pressure, to grow as a player of course, by being alongside some of the best in history, some of the greatest champions,"" he added. ""It's hard and I never thought it would be this difficult to announce that... but I think I needed this, a new challenge, after seven years.""Mbappe's arrival in Paris as a teenager in 2017 came after he had helped Monaco secure the league title. His transfer fee, initially on loan before becoming permanent, remains the second-largest in football history, coming just weeks after PSG paid a world-record 222 million euros to acquire Neymar from Barcelona.Despite the Qatari takeover in 2011 and the subsequent dominance of French football, PSG have struggled to achieve European success, even with the addition of Lionel Messi to their lineup for two seasons. The closest they came was the 2020 Champions League final defeat by Bayern Munich, where PSG academy graduate Kingsley Coman scored the winning goal against his former club.Mbappe, who has scored 43 goals in all competitions this season, including 26 in Ligue 1, will aim to add to his club-record tally of 255 goals for PSG and secure another medal in the French Cup final on May 25. During his seven years at his hometown team, Mbappe has won six Ligue 1 titles, three French Cups, and the now-defunct League Cup twice.Following Sunday's game, PSG will conclude their league campaign with away matches at Nice and relegation-threatened Metz before Mbappe's final appearance for the club in the Cup final in Lille.Mbappe's relationship with PSG boss Luis Enrique has come under scrutiny since he informed the club of his plans to leave earlier this year. The club had initially frozen him out at the start of the campaign, pressuring him to either sign a new deal or agree to be sold rather than simply running down the final year of his contract.",Kylian Mbappe confirms he will leave Paris Saint-Germain at the end of the season.

NEW DELHI: Novak Djokovic expressed his dismay at his unexpected third-round exit from the Rome Open , describing it as ""concerning."" The defeat came just two days after he was struck on the head by a bottle, an incident that left him experiencing symptoms of nausea and dizziness.Djokovic's bid for a record-extending 41st Masters 1000 title came to an abrupt end at the hands of Alejandro Tabilo , a Chilean player ranked 32nd in the world.Tabilo's victory marked his first win over a top-10 opponent, as he defeated Djokovic convincingly with a scoreline of 6-2, 6-3.The 24-time Grand Slam champion attributed his subdued performance to the blow he sustained while greeting fans after his second-round win.Despite initially downplaying the incident and even wearing a cycling crash helmet to training the following morning, Djokovic acknowledged that the effects of the injury may have contributed to his underwhelming performance on the court.The unexpected loss in Rome serves as a setback for Djokovic, particularly as he had enjoyed success at the tournament in the past, having won six titles there.The incident highlights the physical toll that even seemingly minor injuries can have on professional athletes, underscoring the importance of health and safety in sports.""I don't know, to be honest. I have to check that. Training was different. I was going for kind of easy training yesterday. I didn't feel anything, but I also didn't feel the same,"" Djokovic told reporters.""Today under high stress, it was quite bad -- not in terms of pain, but in terms of this balance. Just no coordination. Completely different player from what it was two nights ago.""Djokovic also said that he would have scans to ""see what's going on"" before the French Open in Paris, where he will head not just worried by the after-effects of the bottle incident but also his form.The last time Djokovic got to Roland Garros without a title to his name that season was in 2018, when his first honour of the campaign came at Wimbledon.With the French Open getting underway in two weeks and where he is the defending champion, Djokovic admitted that ""everything needs to be better in order for me to have at least a chance to win"" a 25th Grand Slam.""The way I felt on the court today was just completely like a different player entered into my shoes,"" added Djokovic. ""It's a bit concerning.""With Djokovic's unexpected early elimination from the Rome Open, the landscape of the last major men's tournament before Roland Garros has become wide open. The absence of the top-ranked player leaves an opportunity for other contenders to make their mark.In the day's final match on center court, third seed Alexander Zverev is set to face off against Luciano Darderi, a home hope ranked 54th in the world. This match presents an intriguing battle between an established top player and a rising talent, with both players eager to make their presence felt in the tournament.Meanwhile, Tabilo's impressive victory over Djokovic has captured attention, as he demonstrated exceptional skill and composure against his superstar opponent. Tabilo's performance, marked by 22 winners, only four unforced errors, and no break points faced, solidifies his status as a formidable contender in the tournament.""Honestly in no moment was I like, Okay, I can win this,"" said a delighted Tabilo.""I was playing incredible tennis. Just wanted to keep that level... The whole match I was just trying to take it point by point, not think about the score. Every point was like the start of the match.""Australian Open champion Aryna Sabalenka cruised into the last 16 of the women's tournament with a straight-sets victory over Dayana Yastremska, 6-4, 6-2.Second seed Sabalenka claimed her first win in four matches against Ukrainian Yastremska to set up a clash in the next round with Elina Svitolina, a two-time winner at the Foro Italico, who comfortably beat Anna Kalinskaya 6-3, 6-3.The 26-year-old Belarusian made short work of Yastremska, dispatching her opponent in one hour and 28 minutes without dropping a service game and never looking in trouble.Sabalenka, who has never won in Rome but is a two-time champion on the Madrid clay, looks in good shape to at least match her 2022 run to the semi-finals.""Every time I was losing here, I was so sad,"" she told reporters.""I felt like I lost on the Grand Slam because it was one of the dream tournaments for me to win.""Earlier fifth seed Maria Sakkari lined up a probable last-16 clash with Victoria Azarenka who beat 80th-ranked Egyptian Mayar Sherif 6-2, 6-7 (6/8), 6-3.","Novak Djokovic loses to Alejandro Tabilo 6-2, 6-3 in third round of Rome Open.
