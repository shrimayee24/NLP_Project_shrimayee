Hardik Pandya: 'He couldn't really gain the respect...': Former Sri Lanka cricketer on why Suryakumar Yadav was preferred over Hardik Pandya for India's T20I captaincy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-in-sri-lanka/he-couldnt-really-gain-the-respect-former-sri-lanka-cricketer-on-why-suryakumar-yadav-was-preferred-over-hardik-pandya-for-indias-t20i-captaincy/articleshow/112001035.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) has appointed Suryakumar Yadav as the new T20I captain for the upcoming tour of Sri Lanka, sidelining star all-rounder Hardik Pandya . This decision comes despite Pandya's role as vice-captain during India's recent T20 World Cup 2024 victory.BCCI chief selector Ajit Agarkar attributed the decision to Pandya's fitness issues, but former Sri Lankan cricketer Russel Arnold suggests that there are additional factors involved.Arnold highlighted Pandya’s challenging IPL 2024 season with the Mumbai Indians as a significant factor in the decision. After two successful years with the Gujarat Titans, Pandya’s return to MI was fraught with difficulties. The team ended the season at the bottom of the table, managing only four wins in 14 matches.""I reckon with how the IPL went and whereas Hardik couldn't really gain the respect of everyone around him, might have prompted BCCI to look in a different direction,"" Arnold stated in an interview with Sports Tak.Arnold though feels that both Pandya and Yadav are exceptional players.""Well, both are exceptional players. They bring different things to the party. Suryakumar Yadav is probably one of the better T20 batters going around and the way he plays it, he obviously has to see and read the game like no one else. Hardik has also shown that,"" he said.Pandya’s return to MI was marked by backlash from fans and a disappointing team outcome. The alleged internal discord and poor results appear to have impacted his standing, influencing the BCCI’s decision to select a new leader.""It's about getting everyone to gel and keeping everyone calm and happy so that you can pull in the one direction. I'm not saying that wouldn't have happened under Hardik, but I guess, at this particular moment, it was a good opportunity and it's a great opportunity for Suryakumar to showcase what he can do and make it his own,"" Arnold added.As Team India prepares for the Sri Lanka tour , attention will be focused on Suryakumar Yadav to observe how he handles the captaincy role and leads the team in the T20 format. Meanwhile, Hardik Pandya will be looking to regain his form and respect, potentially making a case for future leadership.",Suryakumar Yadav has been appointed as the new T20I captain for the upcoming tour of Sri Lanka. Star all-rounder Hardik Pandya has been left out of the squad. Pandya was vice-captain during India's recent T20 World Cup 2024 victory.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112001082,imgsize-58282,width-400,resizemode-4/112001082.jpg"

Afghanistan's star player Rashid Khan lit up the Dallas skies above the Grand Prairie Stadium on Wednesday with his blistering half-century for MI New York (MINY) in their Major League Cricket ( MLC ) Eliminator against the Texas Super Kings (TSK).Batting higher in the order than usual, the allrounder bludgeoned TSK bowlers during his 30-ball stay that produced 55 runs, which included an innnovation that stood out in the highlights package of the MINY innings that finished at 163 for 8 in 20 overs.It's almost a common sight to see Rashid successfully replicate MS Dhoni's 'helicopter' shot -- a rapid aerial whip from almost the off-stump towards the on-side, often resulting in a six. But on Wednesday, Rashid added a touch of his own innovation to it, producing the shot with a horizonal bat off a ball from pacer Aaron Hardie (2 for 22) pitched just short of the good-length area.The MINY innings started on the wrong foot after they were asked to bat first by TSK. They lost opener Dewald Brevis for a duck and the big wicket of Nicholas Pooran (8) by Marcus Stoinis inside four overs to be 18 for 2.It followed a brief partnership of 39 runs between Shayan Jahangir and Monank Patel, before Dwayne Bravo (2 fof 18) broke the stand by sending Jahangir (26 off 23 balls) back.That brought Rashid in to join Patel, but just when the partnership started looking threatening, having added 35 runs, spinner Noor Ahmad produced a wicket in the form of Patel (48 off 41 balls).Thereafter Rashid counter-attacked to take his team to challenging total, as Romario Shepherd (8) and MINY skipper Kieron Pollard (6) failed to impress.Rashid's knock, which came a strike rate of 183.33, included 4 fours and 4 sixes.",Rashid Khan scores 55 runs for MI New York (MINY) against Texas Super Kings (TSK) MINY innings finished at 163 for 8 in 20 overs.

NEW DELHI: The Olympic men's football tournament saw an unprecedented start on Wednesday as Morocco shocked two-time gold medalists Argentina with a 2-1 win amid chaotic scenes in Saint-Etienne. The match concluded dramatically, marred by a nearly two-hour suspension following a pitch invasion by Moroccan fans, protesting a late goal by Argentina in the 16th minute of added time, which was eventually disallowed by VAR.The confusion peaked, leaving it unclear whether the game was paused or finished.Spectators were asked to exit the stadium, while players stayed on-site and returned to play the final three minutes of added time in an empty Stade Geoffroy-Guichard. Just before play resumed, Cristian Medina's contentious goal was disallowed for offside after a VAR review , securing Morocco's victory.The scene turned chaotic as Moroccan fans, fearing they were being deprived of a crucial victory, reacted furiously. Objects were thrown, and invading fans were tackled by security personnel on the field. Argentina players were seen flinching when a flare was tossed onto the pitch, with bottles and cups scattered across the field, forcing the game to pause.Initially, it seemed the full-time whistle had been blown, with even FIFA ’s website listing the game as over. However, an hour later, venue organizers clarified that the match was still ongoing, pending a VAR review of the disputed goal.After a prolonged delay, players returned to the field, warmed up, and waited while an official scrutinized video footage. Following a brief explanation to the Argentina team, play resumed for the final three minutes before the official final whistle was blown.Morocco had taken a 2-0 lead before Argentina began a comeback with Giuliano Simeone scoring in the 68th minute. Medina’s attempt to equalize sparked the chaotic scenes.Argentina coach Javier Mascherano expressed disbelief at the situation's handling.""I can't explain what happened. We spent about an hour and a half in the dressing room without any information on what was going to happen,"" Mascherano told reporters. He criticized the delay in the VAR decision and the subsequent play of the final three minutes, arguing that it disrupted the game's momentum.""The Moroccan captains didn't want to play, we didn't want to continue, and fans threw things at us. It's the biggest circus I've ever seen in my life, I don't know why they spent an hour and 20 minutes reviewing a play. If there is offside in Medina's goal let the game go on with the momentum we have, I don't think the game should be played for three minutes after an hour and a half,"" Mascherano added.Despite the chaos, Mascherano encouraged his team to focus on their upcoming Group B fixtures against Iraq and Ukraine.""It's no use complaining. We don't like this kind of thing to happen, but we have to turn the page, look for positive things, and aim for the two victories we need to qualify,"" he said.Argentina will face Iraq in Lyon on Saturday, looking to secure the points needed to advance in the tournament.","Morocco shocked two-time gold medalists Argentina with a 2-1 win amid chaotic scenes in Saint-Etienne.

It has submitted the draft schedule and format for the event and also submitted a budget for the event,"" a PCB insider said.""It is now up to the ICC how soon they circulate, discuss and finalize the schedule of the Champions Trophy.

""That could definitely fluctuate either way. I've not even played 25 innings in Test cricket yet so I won't be getting ahead of myself.""I'll just keep enjoying playing Test cricket. Hopefully I can keep it that high but if not, so be it.""Brook and his Yorkshire colleague, Joe Root , formed a formidable partnership at Trent Bridge, amassing 189 runs together.

He later revealed his grandmother was ""ill and didn't have long left"".And it was his grandmother Pauline, one of his biggest supporters, who was uppermost in Brook's mind when he reached three figures in Nottingham.""It was the first (century) with family there and obviously loads more English fans as well, it was a very nice moment.""I'm not a massive celebrator at a hundred, I just try to soak it all in. I did it all for my grandma.""As soon as I got it, it was just like, 'Yes, a hundred'. But a couple of moments later I got a bit emotional inside, I just didn't show it.

The host nation put on a dominant performance to book their place in the final four.Earlier, Bangladesh set the tone with a resounding 114-run victory over Malaysia.The Bangladeshi team's impressive total of 191 for 2 was largely thanks to opener Murshida Khatun's blistering 80 off 59 balls and captain Nigar Sultana's quick-fire 62 from just 37 deliveries.Bangladesh's decision to bat first proved fruitful as Khatun and Dilara Akter, the wicket-keeper, formed a solid 65-run partnership for the first wicket.

Dushmantha Chameera ruled out of series against India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-in-sri-lanka/dushmantha-chameera-ruled-out-of-series-against-india/articleshow/111994186.cms,"NEW DELHI: Sri Lanka Cricket announced on Wednesday that fast bowler Dushmantha Chameera will not be participating in the upcoming white-ball series against India at home. Chameera has been sidelined due to bronchitis and respiratory infection, which he has not fully recovered from.In light of Chameera's absence, the cricket board has called up Asitha Fernando to replace him in the squad.Fernando, also a pacer, will step in to fill the void left by Chameera's unavailability.""Dushmantha Chameera is still recovering from a bronchitis and respiratory infection he contracted, and hence will not be part of the T20I series,"" Sri Lanka Cricket tweeted.""Asitha Fernando joins the squad in place of Chameera.""Earlier today, Upul Tharanga , the chief selector of Sri Lanka, ""confirmed"" that Chameera will not participate in the upcoming six-match series, which consists of three T20Is and three ODIs.""Yesterday we got the reports, and it can be confirmed that he will miss the T20Is and ODIs against India,"" Tharanga said, as quoted by PTI, during a press in which newly appointed interim head coach Sanath Jayasuriya was also present.Asitha, 26, was the pick of the bowlers in the Lanka Premier League final, grabbing three wickets as the Jaffna Kings beat Galle Marvels.Despite making his debut in 2015 and possessing impressive pace, Chameera's career has been marred by frequent setbacks.Throughout his international career, Chameera represented Sri Lanka in 12 Tests, 52 ODIs, and 55 T20 matches, claiming 32, 56, and 55 wickets respectively. His contributions to the national team have been significant, although his appearances have been limited by injuries.Recently, Chameera missed the last few matches for Kandy Falcons in the Lanka Premier League (LPL). The exact timing and nature of his latest injury remain unclear.Chameera was absent from several significant tournaments, including the 2022 Asia Cup and the following T20 World Cup in Australia, due to a calf injury that prevented his participation.Furthermore, a shoulder injury forced him to sit out the 2023 Asia Cup, and he was originally omitted from the ODI World Cup squad last year. However, he was later added as a replacement when fellow pacer Matheesha Pathirana sustained an injury.In addition, a quadriceps injury caused him to miss the home series against Afghanistan and Bangladesh earlier this year.Although he was included in the squad for the recently-concluded T20 World Cup in the Americas, he did not feature in any of the matches.Gautam Gambhir, who has recently been appointed as the head coach of the Indian cricket team, will face his inaugural challenge during the upcoming series against Sri Lanka.The T20 portion of the tour will be held entirely in Pallekele, commencing with the first match on July 27. The second and third T20 encounters are slated for July 28 and July 30, respectively.Following the T20 series, the action will shift to Colombo for a three-match ODI series.

Football with its roots tracing back to ancient civilizations, it evolved into a modern game in the 19th century in England. The sport is characterised by its simplicity and universal appeal, requiring minimal equipment—a ball and a playing field. Played between two teams of eleven players each, the objective is to score goals by getting the ball into the opposing team's net.Football's global reach is unparalleled, with millions of fans and players spanning every continent. Football's rich history is marked by incredible goal-scoring feats, and the game's all-time highest goal scorers have left an indelible mark on its legacy. Cristiano Ronaldo leads with an astounding 859 goals, celebrated for his longevity and relentless scoring ability. Lionel Messi, renowned for his vision and technique, follows with 821 goals. Here are the all time highest goal scorers in football 2024.Cristiano Ronaldo holds the record for the most goals scored for Real Madrid and for Portugal, surpassing any other male player at the international level. With a total of 873 goals throughout his illustrious career, Ronaldo's achievements include three Premier League titles, five Champions League titles, and the Euro 2016 championship. Despite turning 38 in February, the former Juventus and Manchester United star remains a prolific scorer, having netted 52 goals in 2023 for Portugal and Al-Nassr. His remarkable goal-scoring record, stemming from his evolution from a quick-footed winger to a dominant striker, sets him apart as the greatest marksman in sporting history.Often hailed as the greatest player in football history, Lionel Messi excels in both scoring and playmaking. The Argentine has amassed over 800 goals in just over 1,000 professional matches. His career highlights include scoring 672 goals for Barcelona, winning seven Ballon d'Or awards, and setting the record for most goals in a calendar year with 91. Messi also holds the record for the most hat-tricks in La Liga, with 36.Josef Bican, a star of Austrian football in the 1930s, amassed 805 goals during his career, which spanned from 1931 to 1955. Bican's prolific scoring came during his time with Slavia Prague and other clubs. Despite various accounts of his goal tally, FIFA’s 2020 commemoration confirmed his impressive total. Bican's career included notable achievements in both Austrian and Czechoslovakian football.Romário, a Brazilian legend known for his clinical finishing, scored 775 goals throughout his career. Starting with Vasco da Gama, Romário went on to shine at PSV Eindhoven and Barcelona, where he was a key player in Johan Cruyff’s “Dream Team” that won the La Liga title in the 1993-1994 season.Pelé, often regarded as the greatest player of all time, scored 762 goals over his illustrious career. The three-time World Cup champion remains an iconic figure in football history, celebrated for his remarkable achievements and prolific goal-scoring abilities.Known as ‘The Galloping Major’, Ferenc Puskás was a crucial part of Hungary’s ‘Magnificent Magyars’ and Real Madrid’s 1960 European Cup-winning team. Despite his unassuming physique, Puskás scored the majority of his 729 goals with his powerful left foot from 1943 to 1966.Jimmy Jones, the highest goal-scorer in Irish League football history, scored 647 goals throughout his career. His prolific period with Glenavon, where he netted 517 goals, solidified his reputation as an unstoppable striker.FIFA’s top player in 2020 and 2021, Robert Lewandowski began his career at Dortmund and gained prominence at Bayern Munich with multiple Bundesliga records. Now playing for Barcelona, Lewandowski is Poland’s all-time top scorer and ranks as the third-highest men’s international goal-scorer in Europe.Gerd Müller, renowned for his exceptional poaching skills, scored 634 goals during his career.

So, it was kind of a surprise when we reached the Durand final and won the Super Cup. But it won’t be a surprise if we make the final of a competition this time around. Last season, it was more about protecting a goal and winning points. But now we have options and we are going to be more offensive and aggressive this season,” Cuadrat pointed out.Last month East Bengal’s assistant coachDimas Delgado met Pep Guardiola on the occasion of a reunion that was held on the occasion of the current Manchester City manager’s 16th year anniversary of his first title. Delgado was part of the Barcelona B team in 2007-2008 which was managed by Guardiola before he took charge of the senior team.“Since he’s from City, Mumbai City had come up for discussion as the Premier League club has a tie-up with the ISL team, But we also talked about our project at East Bengal and he wished us luck for the new season,” Delgado said.Speaking on the occasion, Emami director Aditya Agarwal also hoped to see a different East Bengal. “Keeping the long season in mind, we have tried to forge a squad that can challenge for multiple titles,” he said.Cuadrat’s brigade will launch their season with the Durand Cup clash against IAF team on July 29.Mohun Bagan SG on Monday announced the signing of Australian striker Jamie MacLaren.

Maharashtra government

to make amends & announce reward to boost shuttler's morale before Paris Games

MUMBAI: Badminton player Chirag Shetty 's comments regarding Maharashtra government ignoring his achievements while rewarding cricketers from the state for winning the T20 World Cup have stirred up a hornet's nest.Chirag along with Satwiksairaj Rankireddy - the No.3 ranked men's doubles team in the world - played a crucial role in India winning their maiden Thomas Cup in 2022. Chirag, though, wasn't recognised for his effort. After seeing the cricketers being feted, the aggrieved shuttler told TOI on Sunday that ""if the state government can honour World Cup-winning stars, they should also honour him and treat other sports equally"".Besides the Thomas Cup success, Chirag has also won doubles gold at Asian Games , Commonwealth Games and bronze at World Championships. The 27-year-old Malad resident has now found support from prominent sportspersons of the city, who urged the state government to resurrect the situation by rewarding Chirag. Uday Pawar , coach and mentor of Chirag, felt that his ward's achievement is on par with that of cricketers and he should have been rewarded for it.Former India hockey captain MM Somaya said that he had sympathy for Chirag as ""winning the Thomas Cup is a truly historic achievement"". He went on to add that the state government can make amends by announcing a reward for him just before the Paris Olympics begin which will be good ""for his morale as well"".Pawar, a former Asian Games medallist and a prominent badminton coach in the city, said: ""I am not comparing sports but like the cricketers who have brought honour to Maharashtra, so has Chirag. I feel his achievement is on par (with the cricketers). A person who has brought honour to the state shouldn't be demanding but the state should recognise his efforts on its own.""He added that players shouldn't ask for recognition and instead the state government should have a mechanism in place where once they have achieved something of national significance, they should be rewarded.""I think the state's sports ministry should be more active. They should do their own homework and should be aware of who the top players from Maharashtra are. If they don't know about his/her achievement, then the ministry is not functioning properly. They should have people who will keep in touch with the respective associations from state and take updates on how their players are performing,"" said Pawar.Somaya said: ""I would fully agree with Chirag and I would quite understand his position. Since he was the only player from Maharashtra, he deserves the recognition. Need not be such a huge amount that they have given to cricketers but in some manner, he should be rewarded. He is seeking recognition from the state government which I think is only natural and I think it will be fair even if the state govt does it now. He is one of the key players from Maharashtra to participate in the Olympics and has a good chance of winning a medal with Satwik.""He also urged the state government to have a ""consistent policy"" to reward the performers from other sports as well. ""They should reward the players as soon as they know that someone from the state has achieved something big. It should be a standard process. A person shouldn't be applying for it. You should make a person feel a sense of pride when a state government recognises a player on their own,"" felt Somaya.","Badminton player Chirag Shetty's comments regarding Maharashtra government ignoring his achievements have stirred up a hornet's nest.
