The art of staying afloat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/the-art-of-staying-afloat/articleshow/128609349.cms,"Thirukkural with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres. Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece. That morning, I was still jet lagged; sleep had not yet chosen its continent. The phone rang. It was Priya—my schoolmate, gentle by temperament and scrupulous about never calling at unearthly hours. Her mother was once our beloved botany teacher, Miss Vathsala. I answered at once. Priya sounded relieved. “Amma was sobbing and very disturbed,” she said. “At her age, it is difficult to explain social media. She believes everything; thank you for picking up.” I was puzzled. Perhaps she had come across the news of a snowstorm. But then a series of calls began; polite voices, careful tones: ‘Are you alright?’ ‘We heard’, ‘We were worried’. Then Mallika Akka called from our ancestral village. As soon as she heard my voice, she burst out in relief, “Muruga! I will take paal kavadi for you!” Then anger rose. In a rolling Thirunelveli cadence she cursed the unseen wrongdoer; ‘may scorpions rain on his head’, ‘may his house be full of mud’. It landed like a thunderbolt. Somewhere, for the sake of YouTube video views, a malicious YouTuber had released a video announcing my death. He spoke about my various achievements and then went on to show photographs of various VIPs ‘visiting’ my house. The rest of the day was spent on reassurance—answering calls, calming relatives, explaining repeatedly that I was alright, lodging a cybercrime complaint. Suddenly I was in the same boat as the legendary Mark Twain. In 1897, a newspaper prematurely reported his death and even carried a moving account of his life. Twain responded with his immortal wit: “Reports of my death are greatly exaggerated.” That evening, I called Miss Vathsala again—this time understanding her distress of the previous day. She spoke softly, as though the world had grown harsher. “It must be a very tough life out there,” she said. “I don’t know how you manage.” I smiled. “Miss, you taught us how to.” She thought I was offering courtesy. But I meant it literally. “Every water flower does this,” I said. “It must keep itself above the water level or it will perish. The depth of the pond may rise or fall. But the flower adjusts the length of its stalk to the depth of the water; it’s a classic example of plasticity in plant morphology. The lesson she had once explained returned now as life’s algorithm. A lotus rooted in mud does not argue with the pond. It grows with just enough zeal to remain in light. Miss Vathsala fell silent for a moment, then laughed. Her subject had moved beyond the classroom and entered life. Botany, after all, was never only about plants. Centuries earlier, another keen observer of flora and fauna had observed the same truth. In Kural 595, Thiruvalluvar writes: Vellath Thanaya Malarneettam; Maandhartham Ullath Thanayadhu Uyarvu As the water flowers shoots up to the surface of water, Man is hoisted to the level of his zeal The depth of the water—like circumstances—lies beyond command. But the inward reach, the will to rise, determines whether we bloom or drown. That day’s false rumour was not mine to choose. But something else was – the decision to stay above the waterline of fear, to return by evening to equilibrium. Zeal is that silent struggle under water, not known or seen outside. Depths may increase; shadows may gather. Still, the flower remembers the sun—and because it remembers, it rises.","Bharathi Bhaskar explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’ Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128611669,imgsize-40958,width-1000,height-562,resizemode-75/128611669.jpg"

Where will Sidney Crosby’s absence be felt most if he can’t play Friday?

Sidney Crosby Team Canada injury update for Team Canada semifinal against Finland at Milano Cortina Olympics



Without Crosby, the team would not only have less scoring depth, but also less leadership on the ice. Jon Cooper, the head coach, has been careful with what he says, telling people to be careful and not saying whether or not his captain will play. Team Canada has to wait nervously for the NHL game in Milan today because they want to win a spot in the gold medal game.The worry comes from a hard hit Crosby took during the quarterfinal win on Wednesday. He left in the second period and didn't come back, which made people wonder how bad the injury was right away. There has been no confirmation of structural damage, but the quick turnaround between games makes it hard for him to be available. Canada's medical staff checks on the players every day, and Cooper said again that no player will be put in danger. There is still a chance that a decision will be made at game time. Both fans and opponents may not know until after a pregame skate what the final call will be.The most recent updates on Sidney Crosby's injury in the NHL say that he is still doubtful but not officially out. Reports say that Crosby might be able to test the injury during a morning skate before the coaches send in their final lineup.Nick Suzuki of the Montreal Canadiens is expected to take over Crosby's even-strength role if he can't play. Connor McDavid of the Edmonton Oilers could take on more leadership roles. He has already worn an alternate captain's ""A"" during the tournament.Finland's well-organized defense will be a challenge for Canada, no matter what Crosby's condition is. Canada's depth gives them some flexibility, but it's almost impossible to replace his two-way impact.

Viktor Arvidsson: NHL trade rumours: Boston Bruins consider Viktor Arvidsson trade as NHL freeze thaws and playoff race begins,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/nhl-trade-rumours-boston-bruins-consider-viktor-arvidsson-trade-as-nhl-freeze-thaws-and-playoff-race-begins/articleshow/128611448.cms,"Viktor Arvidsson (via Getty Images)

Viktor Arvidsson’s breakout season presents tough decision between trade asset and team catalyst



The clock is officially ticking for the Boston Bruins as the roster freeze expires this Sunday night. General manager Don Sweeney has less than a week to determine whether the Boston Bruins need to buy, sell, or strike a balance as the March 6 trade deadline approaches.Preliminary reports have the Boston Bruins targeting an addition of talent, likely in the form of a top-four defenseman or a first-line center. However, the Boston Bruins’ next four games may end up determining their trade deadline course, and one surprising name that has popped up in trade rumors is that of Swedish ice hockey right wing Viktor Arvidsson.Viktor Arvidsson has quietly emerged as one of the most potent secondary scorers on the Boston Bruins roster, chipping in 14 goals and 28 points in 45 games while showing great chemistry with Casey Mittelstadt and Pavel Zacha. He is also the only Boston Bruins forward who is not yet signed for next season, making him both a potential rental player and a problem on the horizon.The 32-year-old player was selected by the Nashville Predators in the fourth round, 112th overall, at the 2014 NHL entry draft. He is well known for winning the Swedish Championship twice with Skellefteå AIK in the Swedish Hockey League (SHL). His trade value has increased, as it is believed that he could now bring in a much higher return in terms of draft picks or other assets from a contender looking to add to their scoring depth.This small investment could be turned into a high draft pick or other assets, which would be phenomenal asset management.Trading him off as part of a bigger deal for a premium upgrade is theoretically enticing, but it is most unlikely to happen. The teams letting go of their elite centers or best defenders usually ask for young talent, prospects, or long-term assets.An extension is another option. Arvidsson has surprised and been useful in developing young players. However, with most of Boston’s roster already committed to next season, even a short-term extension may not align with the team’s financial or organizational goals.If Boston retains him past the trade deadline, they may lose him for free in the offseason. However, if they trade him away, they might sabotage their own playoff chances.In a highly competitive Eastern Conference, Sweeney’s Arvidsson move might just show whether the Bruins are committed to this season as a contender or as a rebuilding phase for what’s to come.","Viktor Arvidsson has quietly emerged as one of the most potent secondary scorers on the Boston Bruins roster.

Mike Kadlick calls out Tom Brady’s ‘no dog in the fight’ line after Team USA’s overtime win

Tom Brady’s $150 million bunker and Livvy Dunne partnership keep his post-retirement profile loud

Tom Brady tried to play neutral before Super Bowl LX, telling everyone he “didn't have a dog in the fight” when the New England Patriots faced the Seattle Seahawks at Levi’s Stadium earlier this month.A week later, he was in the stands at the Santa Giulia Arena, all in on Team USA in the women’s gold-medal game against Canada, and an NFL analyst immediately called him on it.In the buildup to Patriots vs. Seahawks in Super Bowl LX, the six-time Super Bowl winner tried to stay above the fray.“I don't have a dog in the fight in this one. May the best team win,” Brady said. “And in terms of the Patriots, this is a new chapter in New England, and I'm glad everyone's embraced the Mike Vrabel regime, all the amazing players that have worked so hard to get their club to this position.”That distance didn’t sit perfectly with everyone in New England, but it at least sounded like he was staying out of it. Then came Thursday’s women’s hockey final at the Winter Olympics. Megan Keller scored just over four minutes into overtime to give the United States a 2-1 win over Canada in the gold-medal game, and Brady was right there for the moment.He shared a picture of his son, Benjamin, celebrating the win with a friend on his Instagram story, adding the line: “Most Dominant Team in the world.”NFL analyst Mike Kadlick spotted the shift and went straight to X with a sharp question: “Does he have a dog in the fight?”It was a clean little jab. Brady wanted to be neutral when the Patriots were playing for a Lombardi, but he had no issue declaring the U.S. women the best in the world from his Olympic seat. Nobody is mad he backed Team USA. The point is simple: when you tell fans you’re out of the rivalry business, they’re going to notice every time you pick a side.While everyone was dissecting his “dog in the fight” stance, Brady’s off-field life kept getting bigger. Earlier this week, Mary K. Jacob of the New York Post reported that his 25,000-square-foot mansion on Indian Creek Island in Miami is effectively finished, years after he and Gisele Bündchen bought the two-acre waterfront lot for about $17 million in 2020 and tore down the old home.The new build sits on one of the most tightly guarded pieces of land in the country, with a pale stone-and-glass façade facing Biscayne Bay, deep balconies, and a long run of private dockage. Behind the house, photos show his reported $6.5 million speedboat and two Yamaha WaveRunners, each around $20,000, parked on lifts. Records cited in the report note that Brady transferred the property into a new trust in December and took out a $35 million loan, with documents stating the beneficiary intends to make it his Florida homestead.That same week, his business side added another headline name. As Jake Fenner reported, Brady’s NoBull brand brought in social media star and former LSU gymnast Livvy Dunne as an athlete, investor, and partner. Dunne announced it with an Instagram shoot and the caption: “sooo excited to join the nobull team alongside @tombrady as an athlete, investor, and partner... LFG!”Brady dropped into the comments with his trademark response, simply adding “LFG” and three raised-hand emojis. Dunne, who has shifted from college gymnastics into a mix of real estate and sponsorship deals, is also often seen backing Pittsburgh Pirates ace Paul Skenes. At the Super Bowl, she told the Daily Mail, “I'll try to make all of his starts, that's my goal this year,” and added, “We both travel so much, it's so important to put your phone down and just be with one another and be there for each other. ”Put it all together and the picture is clear. Brady might say he doesn’t have a dog in certain fights, but between picking sides for Team USA on Olympic ice, building a $150 million bunker in Miami, and signing one of the biggest names in college sports to his brand, he’s not exactly living a quiet, neutral retirement.","Tom Brady tried to play neutral before Super Bowl LX, telling everyone he “didn’t have a dog in the fight” when the New England Patriots faced the Seattle Seahawks.

Giannis Antetokounmpo's contract situation and salary cap implications



What the Bucks would want in return



Multiple unprotected first-round picks

Pick swaps

Young, high-upside rotation players

Cap flexibility

The Los Angeles Clippers have surfaced in fresh league chatter involving Giannis Antetokounmpo , with insiders revealing that teams pursuing the Milwaukee Bucks star recently contacted Los Angeles about Kawhi Leonard’s availability. According to ClutchPoints reporter Brett Siegel, two Giannis suitors checked in with the Clippers ahead of the deadline to gauge interest in Leonard. The calls did not lead to movement, yet they signal how interconnected both superstars have become in trade discussions.The Clippers sit 26-28 and 10th in the Western Conference after recovering from a 6-21 start. Milwaukee, meanwhile, is 23-30 and 12th in the East. As both teams navigate uncertain playoff paths, league executives are evaluating long-term direction, contracts, and draft capital that could reshape the summer market.The NBA trade rumor linking the Clippers and Giannis Antetokounmpo stems from roster flexibility and new draft assets. On Clutch Scoops, Tomer Azarly said, “The Clippers could enter the Giannis sweepstakes if he’s available. They would have four very, very good draft picks, including the two Pacers ones that teams could be interested in.The Bucks could be interested in a couple of young players. So, could you pair Giannis and Kawhi together? That could be an interesting combo if you’re able to. ”Los Angeles strengthened its asset base by acquiring Bennedict Mathurin, Isaiah Jackson, a protected 2026 first-round pick, an unprotected 2029 first-round pick and a future second-round selection from Indiana. Those selections create credible leverage if a franchise player becomes attainable.Antetokounmpo is averaging 28 points, 10 rebounds, and 5.6 assists while shooting 64.5 percent from the field. Leonard has also been highly productive at 27.9 points per game on 49.1 percent shooting. From a basketball standpoint, pairing both would immediately elevate championship projections. The scenario now depends on Milwaukee’s willingness to engage.Any NBA trade rumor involving Giannis Antetokounmpo must account for his contract. He signed a three-year, $175,369,698 fully guaranteed deal with Milwaukee, carrying an average annual salary of $58,456,566. In 2025-26, he will earn $54,126,450 with a matching cap hit, per Spotrac.Antetokounmpo addressed his long-term outlook during an interview with COSMOTE TV. “As Americans say, opinions are cheap; that’s why everyone has one. Right now, at this moment, I’m in Milwaukee… I don’t know if I’ll leave, it’s not up to me. If it was up to me, maybe I already would have left. In a year and a half, when I become a free agent at 32, it will be up to me,” Antetokounmpo said.“No one can dare come and tell me not to play. I never gave anyone that right, as long as my legs allow me, I’ll be out there.”His salary would require significant matching contracts and draft equity. So there is also a financial weight that might influence the discussion.If this NBA trade rumor advances to reality, Milwaukee’s asking price would be substantial. Franchise-level talent rarely moves without multiple unprotected first-round picks, young rotation players, and cap flexibility.At least two to four unprotected first-round picks to secure long-term draft control and rebuild flexibility.Future first-round pick swaps to maintain leverage in upcoming drafts.Proven young talent who can contribute immediately while still fitting a long-term timeline.Contracts that provide financial breathing room or allow Milwaukee to reshape the roster quickly.The Clippers’ newly acquired Pacers picks provide value, though Milwaukee could seek additional compensation to justify parting with a former MVP. League insiders have already connected Leonard’s situation to past blockbuster decisions. Siegel said, “There were two teams in particular that were pursuing Giannis that had made calls to the Clippers about Kawhi Leonard, checking in on his availability.”He added, “From the front office stand point and if you’re looking at this through the lens of the Clippers future, it probably makes a lot more sense to just trade him the off-season.”At this stage, discussions are exploratory. Still, with both franchises balancing performance and long-term planning, the possibility of a surprising summer cannot be dismissed.","The Los Angeles Clippers have surfaced in fresh league chatter involving Giannis Antetokounmpo.

"Best Value Nba Contracts: Top 5 most valued NBA contracts in 2026: Jalen Brunson, Derrick White, and more",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/top-5-most-valued-nba-contracts-in-2026-jalen-brunson-derrick-white-and-more/articleshow/128615317.cms,"Jalen Brunson, Jaden McDaniels, and Derrick White (Images via Getty)

1. Deni Avdija: Portland Trail Blazers (Declining Structure)

2. Jalen Brunson: New York Knicks (Player Option)

3. Derrick White: Boston Celtics (Player Option)



4. Jalen Johnson: Atlanta Hawks (UFA)

5. Jaden McDaniels: Minnesota Timberwolves (UFA)

The NBA's financial landscape is reaching new heights to fulfill its global expansion dream, fueled by the 11-year, $77 billion media rights deal with Disney, Amazon, and Comcast's NBCUniversal. And in this ever-evolving landscape of the salary caps, finding a superstar on a bargain deal is the ultimate cheat code for front offices.Though the trade season ended on February 5th, still lets take a look at some of the most valued NBA contracts in 2026 as per Spotrac. Spotrac broke down the most team-friendly deals in the league, excluding rookie scales and max extensions, to find the true steals.Fresh off his first All-Star appearance, Deni Avdija was Wizards’ 9th overall pick in 2020, and was later sent to Blazers in 2024, where he signed a 4-year, $55 million contract. It’s rare to find a potential All-Star locked into a declining salary structure, and the Blazers have exactly that.Avdija has $39.4 million remaining on his contract, and this season, he’ll earn $13.3 million, $13.1 million next season, and $11.8 million in 2027-28. Despite the declining salary value, he still has a $14.3 million cap hit and continues to blossom into a versatile wing who impacts both ends of the floor.Jalen Brunson’s four-year, $156.5 million extension stunned the basketball world as the 3-time NBA All-Star sacrificed a whopping $113 million to help the Knicks build a contender team. For the Knicks' offensive cornerstone, the $39.1 million average annual salary seems like a massive win for New York.Under this deal, Jalen Brunson will get a player option in the final season and is eligible to sign an extension worth over $400 million. He is set to earn $34.9 million this season, and this financial flexibility has allowed the Knicks to surround him with high-level talent.Derrick White is the ultimate connector, and his four-year, $125.8 million extension is proving to be worth every penny. With an average annual value of $31.5 million, the Celtics are paying a starter's salary for a player who has proven he can scale his role up to a primary option when needed.For the 2025-26 season, White is set to earn a base salary of $26,350,000, while carrying a cap hit of $28,100,000 and a dead cap value of $26,350,000. The contract will see him through the 2028-29 season, where he’ll earn $34.8 million with a player option.The post-Trae Young Hawks will be heavily dependent on the shoulders of the 24-year old Jalen Johnson. Since joining the franchise as a rookie, Johnson secured a 5 year, $150 million rookie extension back in 2024. Effective from this season, he’s set to earn a base salary of $30 million per season, which is Hawks’ masterstroke in cap management.Unlike most deals that scale upward, the flat structure means Johnson’s cap hit will actually become valuable with the rising salary cap each year. For the 23.3 points, 10.6 rebounds, and 8.2 assists threat, the $30 million paycheck is definitely a steal.Jaden McDaniels remains the Timberwolves’ elite perimeter defender while he continues to hone his skills as a two-way force on the hardwood. Signed under a five-year, $131 million rookie extension, the 25-year-old will get an annual average salary of $26.2 million.McDaniels is having a breakout season as he is shooting with a career high of 51.9% from the floor and 45.4% from the deep. His shot efficiency, combined with elite lockdown defense for under $27 million, is a steal for the Wolves and their luxury tax limit.","The NBA's financial landscape is reaching new heights to fulfill its global expansion dream, fueled by the 11-year, $77 billion media rights deal with Disney, Amazon, and Comcast's NBCUniversal.

Kylie Kelce lost in her phone while attending Winter Olympics

Going in the opposite direction, the fierce tigress said! “Not Gonna Lie” podcast host Kylie Kelce does not want to be known as “Kylie Kelce and her husband.” She recently spoke on her podcast and shared a CBC Olympics post that used that phrase. She said, “Cut that out. We’ve leaned too far in the opposite direction. You know what’s great? Jason and Kylie Kelce.”Is she trying to keep her retired NFL star husband relevant? Or is she too old-fashioned to be known by her name? Unlike modern women, who often keep their maiden surname after marriage and sometimes attach their husband’s surname as initials, like “N.” or “S” to their names. Maybe Kylie just wanted her husband to be known and named as well. Could be anything. Anyway, let’s talk about her Winter Olympics snippets now.The main event at Milan for the mom-of-four was the Women’s Ice Hockey semi-finals. She admitted they had not planned to attend, but when they heard women were playing, they decided to go. Kylie is a former field hockey player.Afterward, CBC Olympics shared a picture of the couple in the spectator stands. They captioned it: “Kylie Kelce and her husband supporting @TeamUSA women’s hockey.”The retired Philadelphia Eagles center brought the post to Kylie’s attention at breakfast.She said on the podcast, “This is ridiculous. Cut that out. We’ve leaned too far in the opposite direction.” We’ve already established what’s great for Jason’s wife. She quickly shifted the podcast to a different topic and expressed displeasure for the photo the CBC Olympics shared.The photo posted by CBC Olympics showed her lost in her phone. She said, “I’m a little sad about this because I’m barely ever on my phone. Last night, I was busy watching [women’s hockey semi-finals], and then you caught me on my phone. So, you caught me. You got me.”Then the 33-year-old NFL WAG pointed out that “people were enjoying the caption though,” and later quietly admitted, “Maybe we should say both names. But [pause], you know, [tilts her head to one side], sure [chuckles].” She seems confused. Again, like most modern women.The ardent Philadelphia Eagles fan shared that it was the first competition they attended at the Winter Olympics. The women’s ice hockey team dominated in a way she couldn’t explain.Her favorite story from the global event was Cory and Korey [Cory Thiesse and Korey Dropkin] winning a silver medal in mixed doubles curling at the 2026 Milano Cortina Winter Olympics on Feb 10.","Jason Kelce brought CBC Olympics post to Kylie Kelce’s attention on her podcast.

Freddy Peralta’s 2026 MLB salary and contract structure

Breaking down Freddy Peralta’s net worth and overall earnings in 2026

A busy Major League Baseball winter has quickly turned the financials of Freddy Peralta from one of the Brewers' best bargains to talking points about the Mets' payroll. That makes the right-hander, who is only controlled through the end of the 2026 season with the extension he signed earlier in his career, likely not just a perfect fit for a contender in the short-term but probably a big-name free agent even sooner than later.That was before the January 2026 trade that sent Freddy Peralta to New York and essentially changed his financial trajectory. Part of a win-now deal for the Mets, the soon-to-be-31-year-old Peralta immediately became a big name that will be on the radar of anyone looking ahead to the next free agent class. Although it did not alter his existing contract, the trade bolstered his stock and bargaining position in advance of the last season of team control.Peralta is in the last of a five-year, $15.5 million team-friendly extension he signed in 2020 (the deal included club options). His salary comes in at just under $8 million for 2026, a figure well below the top end of starting pitcher pay, given the frontline-quality numbers he produces.That figure is probably more indicative of early-career security than of what the market actually has to offer today. Similar players with similar durability and strikeout rates command two- to three-times that amount per season.The appeal was apparent for the Mets, as they added a reliable arm without taking on any long-term financial obligation, and for Peralta, he gets to pitch in a big market in a walk year.Peralta’s career MLB earnings are set to be right around the low-to-mid $20 million range before taxes, agent fees, and living expenses by the end of the 2026 season. Net-worth estimates vary widely, but most put him in the mid-single-digit to low-eight-figure range in 2026, after accounting for savings, a modest endorsement income, and typical professional-athletes-go-broke planning.But what really determines Peralta's financial future is what happens next. There is a reasonable expectation among league execs that he will explore free agency post-2026, and early industry murmurs indicate a multi-year deal beyond the $100 million threshold if health and production stick around. That kind of contract would immediately eclipse his career earnings to this point and reset any conversation about his worth.","Peralta is in the last of a five-year, $15.5 million team-friendly extension he signed in 2020 (the deal included club options).

Alex Ovechkin addresses his NHL future with the Washington Capitals and beyond, amid playoff push

Alex Ovechkin is three-time Hart Trophy winner

Washington Capitals captain Alex Ovechkin has recently delivered a candid assessment regarding his future in the NHL , addressing his long-running speculation about retirement and what comes next after the 2025-26 season. Ovechkin, who is in the final year of his current contract with the Capitals, clarified that he has yet to decide his playing future beyond this season.Despite intense media and fan interest, the 39-year-old said he isn't in a rush to announce retirement and has no final decision about his future beyond his current contract, and he won’t likely make a hasty decision by the end of the season. It is to be noted that the Caps are currently 29-23-7, and four points behind the Boston Bruins in the Eastern Conference wildcard race.Alex Ovechkin, the Washington Capitals' captain and NHL's all-time leading goal scorer, has dropped candid insights on his post-season plans following the Olympic break. The Russian star emphasized that he has not taken any final decision about his future beyond his current contract, which is supposed to expire after this season.Speaking to NHL beat writer Tom Gulitti, Ovechkin stated, “No, I don’t know yet. We have to make a decision. We have to talk with the family, with (Capitals owner) Ted (Leonsis), [general manager Chris Patrick], and then we’ll see.”Ovechkin stated he needs to consult with his family, Capitals team owner Ted Leonsis, and general manager Chris Patrick before committing further. On the other hand, speculation has swirled due to his age and the team's position, but he dismissed retirement talk for now.The three-time Hart Trophy winner further stated, “We have ups and downs. It’s not about me. You see, everybody was maybe a little struggling because last year, we scored like five, six goals in a game, and it was easy.” This clearly states that he won’t be deciding anything about his future by the end of the season.As for his performance, Ovechkin has 22 goals and 48 points in 59 games, trailing teammate Tom Wilson. However, reports suggest that last season he scored 44 goals in 65 games, including breaking Wayne Gretzky's record, setting high expectations despite a fibula injury.It is to be noted that Ovechkin is also currently on a break, as Russia has not been invited to the 2026 Winter Olympics. The veteran player could be seen in action against the Capitals in their first game after the Olympic break, where they will lock horns against the Philadelphia Flyers.","Alex Ovechkin is the Washington Capitals' captain and NHL's all-time leading goal scorer.

How Jakub Menšík built his rising tennis fortune



One big night can change how a career feels. For Jakub Menšík, Doha was that night. At the 2026 Qatar Open in Doha on February 19, the 19-year-old Czech delivered the biggest result of his career by defeating the world No. 2, Jannik Sinner, in the quarterfinals. He came through a tight three-set match, winning 7-6(3), 2-6, 6-3 after more than two hours on court. It was a composed and confident performance against one of the most consistent players in men’s tennis, and it sent Menšík into the semifinals with some serious momentum. He served boldly, swung freely and trusted his power when the pressure tightened.A win like that changes things. It gives a young player a lot of confidence. Opponents start taking him seriously. Fans stop calling him “one for the future.” And whenever a teenager breaks through like that, curiosity naturally turns to the bigger picture, which includes what it means financially. Let's take a look at his net worth.According to his official ATP Tour profile, Menšík has earned approximately $5.28 million in career prize money so far. For someone who is still only 19, that’s a whopping number.It reflects steady progression, consistent tour-level results and the ability to compete deep into events. But prize money figures can be misleading. The $5.28 million listed on the ATP site is gross income. Professional tennis players pay their own way. Coaches, physios and fitness trainers are not optional at this level but essential. Travel is constant and international. Hotels, flights and tournament expenses stack up quickly. Add management commissions and taxes across multiple countries, and the headline figure shrinks fast.Once those deductions are factored in, industry estimates suggest Menšík’s 2026 net worth likely falls somewhere between $1.5 million and $3.5 million. That range is typical for a rising ATP player who is earning well but still investing heavily in building a long-term career.Commercially, he’s still early in his journey. He doesn’t yet have the blockbuster endorsement deals that established top-10 stars command. However, statement wins dramatically increase visibility. Brands are drawn to youth, momentum and upside and a fearless teenager who just beat one of the sport’s most consistent players checks all three boxes.Right now, Menšík’s finances reflect a player climbing rather than one who has fully arrived. If performances like Doha become regular instead of rare, both his ranking and his earning power could rise very quickly.","Jakub Menšík beat world No. 2 Jannik Sinner 7-6(3), 2-6, 6-3 in the quarterfinals of the 2026 Qatar Open in Doha on February 19.

Tommaso Giacomel’s Olympic heartbreak as Johannes Dale-Skjevdal wins gold

Tommaso Giacomel looked ready for a medal. Then, in a shocking turn, he was sitting in the snow. The 22-year-old Italian biathlon star shocked fans after collapsing during the men’s 15km mass start at the 2026 Winter Olympics. The worrying moment happened in Anterselva during the Milan-Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics. Tommaso Giacomel was in strong form and even led the race at the halfway mark. He had hit all his targets in two shooting stages without a single miss. The home crowd believed a medal was coming. But things changed quickly. Giacomel began to slow down on the snowy track. Other athletes passed him. Soon after, television cameras showed him sitting on the ground in the woods section of the course. His ski poles were beside him. Officials rushed to check on him.According to Eurosport, commentators described it as a “Cursed Olympics” for Giacomel and reported that he appeared to struggle with his breathing. He did not finish the race. In fact, he was the only one among the 30 competitors who did not cross the finish line. More than an hour later, Italy coach Fabio Cianciana gave an update. He said, “Health comes before the races.If Tommy felt some pain in the ribs, it is right that he has stopped. ” He added, “After one minute, he already felt better. He went on his legs for the first medical check. Now he is doing other treatments and he is fine.”Cianciana also spoke about how well Giacomel was performing before the incident. He said, “The race was going very well. Once he passed unharmed from the prone shooting, we knew that Tommaso would have been very dangerous on the standing shooting.”While Giacomel’s race ended in pain, the competition continued. Johannes Dale-Skjevdal of Norway won gold with a perfect performance. He hit all 20 of his shots. His teammate Sturla Holm Laegreid took silver and finished the Games with a medal in each of the five races he entered.For Giacomel, this was his sixth event of the Olympics. He had already raced in the individual, sprint, pursuit, mass start, and team relay. He also won a silver medal in the mixed relay, which means he will not leave the Games without success.Still, the scene in Anterselva left fans concerned.

United WE Announces Brittany Mahomes as First Champion for Change Winner



""at the decision-making table,""

In Kansas City, the Mahomes name is synonymous with winning but while Patrick is busy leading the Chiefs and recovering from his injury, Brittany Mahomes is carving out a legacy that is arguably just as historic.

As a co-owner of the KC Current, she didn't just buy into a team, she invested in an entire ecosystem. She was a driving force behind the construction of CPKC Stadium, which made global headlines for being the first stadium on Earth built specifically for a women’s professional team.United WE noted that her leadership proves that when women arethe entire economy grows stronger. By treating women’s sports as a ""growing economic engine"" rather than a side project, she has changed the blueprint for sports ownership in America.Beyond the soccer pitch, the award highlights her philanthropic work. Alongside her husband, Patrick Mahomes , Brittany has channeled millions through the 15 and the Mahomies Foundation. These funds have gone directly into underserved communities, focusing on children's health, wellness, and educational opportunities.The organization emphasized that Brittany’s role as an entrepreneur, investor, and mother of three makes her the perfect face for this new award.

Mens Hockey Olympics : Sidney Crosby ruled out as Canada faces Finland after both teams win dramatic overtime quarterfinals

Winter Olympics fans woke up early on Friday ready to watch one of the biggest games of the 2026 Milano Cortina Games. But many were shocked when they could not see the start of the Canada vs Finland men’s hockey semifinal on regular TV. The game began at 10:40 a.m. Eastern Time. Instead of airing live on cable, the opening part of the matchup was available only on Peacock. USA Network, which is owned by NBCUniversal, showed the women’s speed skating 1500m during that time. NBC later scheduled delayed coverage of the hockey game at 11:50 a.m. ET on USA Network.Fans quickly shared their anger online. Many said they felt frustrated that such a major semifinal was not shown live on television. The matchup featured top-seeded Canada and defending 2022 Olympic champion Finland, making the decision even more surprising for viewers across the United States.The semifinal was already a huge story before the broadcast issue. Canada entered the game as the No. 1 seed, while Finland came in as the defending gold medalist from the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing.Both teams fought hard in the quarterfinals earlier in the week.Finland edged Switzerland 3-2 in overtime. Canada also needed extra time to beat Czechia 4-3. Those close wins set up what many believed would be one of the best hockey games of the tournament.However, Canada had to prepare without its captain, Sidney Crosby. The veteran forward suffered a lower-body injury during Wednesday’s quarterfinal and was ruled out of the semifinal. His absence was another major talking point heading into Friday’s game.Still, much of the online reaction focused on the broadcast choice. Fans took to X to express how they felt.One fan wrote, “Not having this Canada-Finland hockey game on a dedicated tv channel is infuriating to me.”Another posted, “Absolutely wild the Canada Finland semi final game isn’t on tv right now.”A different viewer added, “Why is my USA channel playing speed skating??? All your stars yet I have to have peacock to watch???”One more comment read, “Everywhere I look, I see that USA Network is supposed to be broadcasting the CAN/FIN hockey semifinal. Yet — they aren’t.”For many hockey fans, the issue was not about streaming itself. It was about missing the first hour of a major Olympic semifinal on traditional television. With two strong teams on the ice and a place in the gold medal game at stake, viewers expected full live coverage from the opening puck drop.","The Canada vs Finland men’s hockey semifinal began at 10:40 a.m. Eastern Time.

Inside Kelce’s $6 million Leawood mansion

Earlier Kansas City home and Florida family condo

Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce is known for his success on the football field, but his real estate choices have also drawn major attention. The NFL star has owned a lot of homes throughout the years that shows how he lives, and how he intends for the future. The spotlight on his homes increased even more after his relationship with pop star Taylor Swift became public.The best among Kelce's expensive properties is his gorgeous residence in Leawood, Kansas. One of the most talked-about residences for NFL players is this one because it boasts seclusion, exciting amenities, and a modern decor.Kelce's Leawood mansion is worth roughly $6 million and contains more than 17,000 square feet. Located at the end of a quiet cul-de-sac, the property was designed with privacy in mind, an important factor given Kelce’s global popularity. The house features six bedrooms and several bathrooms, offering enough space for guests, family, and large gatherings.The mansion is built in a French Regency style and includes high-end features that make it feel like a luxury resort. Inside the property there are a lot of places to have fun such as a complete bar, a wine cellar, and a two-level movie theater.The exterior environment is just as beautiful, with a resort-style pool, a waterfall, a wide patio, and many acres of manicured grounds.For fitness and recreation, the home includes a private gym, sauna, pickleball court, and even a miniature golf course. These features highlight Kelce’s focus on recovery, training, and leisure in one place. Reports suggest that the mansion also served as the setting for his widely discussed proposal to Swift, adding emotional value to the property.Before moving into the Leawood estate, Kelce purchased a home in Kansas City’s Briarcliff West neighborhood in 2019 for under $1 million. That property marked an earlier stage of his career when he was already a star but had not yet reached his current level of fame. The house offered space for training and relaxation and has since increased in value.Kelce lives with his brother Jason Kelce and his mother Donna in a house near Orlando, Florida. On the other hand, the condo shows how much he loves his family and gives him a nice location to stay when he's not playing football.Kelce's real estate portfolio shows how his life has shifted from being a rising NFL player to a world-famous figure. His homes give him style, and an opportunity to make long-term investments. Real estate is still a big part of his life outside of sports, even as he gets more recognized and his career rolls on.","Travis Kelce's Leawood mansion is worth roughly $6 million and contains more than 17,000 square feet.

A peaceful base away from the tour for Novak Djokovic



Tennis legend Novak Djokovic has spent years living out of suitcases, hotel rooms and player lounges. So when he goes home, he really goes home. For the tennis great, that place is Marbella, Spain — a quiet, sun-soaked corner of the Costa del Sol where he can switch off from the noise of the tour and just be with his family. His villa is located in Sierra Blanca, one of Marbella’s most private and high-end residential areas. It sits slightly above the coastline, with open views of the Mediterranean and the mountains behind it. The neighborhood is known for security and seclusion. For someone as globally recognized as Djokovic, that kind of privacy isn’t a luxury, but a necessity.The house is large but not flashy. It is reported to span close to 1,000 square metres, with open living spaces and several bedrooms. Inside, the design is simple and calm, with marble floors, soft colours and large glass doors that bring in natural light. Outside, there is a spacious swimming pool and open terraces where the family can relax. The gardens are neatly kept and offer privacy and quiet.The villa also supports his training routine. It reportedly has nine bedrooms and eight bathrooms, along with a private gym and a spa area that includes a sauna and Turkish bath.There is a cinema room, a games room and a private tennis court where he can practise away from the public eye. With sea and mountain views around the property, the home works as both a peaceful retreat and a private training base. For a player known for his strict routines and recovery work, having those facilities at home makes sense. Even in downtime, the work doesn’t completely stop.The mansion is believed to be worth around $10 million approximately, reflecting both the prime location and its size. Djokovic is said to have settled there around 2020, after spending time in the area and enjoying the climate. Marbella offers warm weather most of the year, which is ideal for training. But more importantly, it offers space that is away from cameras and constant attention.For fans, it’s nice to see this side of Djokovic. On court, he is intense and fully focused. In Marbella, life is quieter and slower for the tennis icon. His home seems not about showing off, but about comfort, privacy and balance.

Day 14 at the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan-Cortina delivered big moments and fresh updated. Team USA grabbed headlines as Megan Keller scored an overtime goal to beat Canada in women’s hockey, while Alysa Liu captured gold in women’s figure skating. At the same time, curling found itself under fresh scrutiny, adding tension off the ice.

They will meet Switzerland one more time in Friday’s big semifinal game. Sweden and Canada also earned spots in the women’s curling semifinals, setting up a packed Friday of medal battles on the ice.On Thursday night in Milan, 20-year-old Alysa Liu won gold in women’s singles figure skating. She became the first American woman to win this Olympic title since 2002. She performed her free skate to “MacArthur Park” at the Milano Ice Skating Arena and moved ahead of Japan’s Kaori Sakamoto, who won silver, and Ami Nakai, who took bronze.After her skate, Alysa Liu smiled, brushed off her shoulders, and waved to the crowd. The result was confirmed by official Olympic scoring shared with media on site. This was one of the biggest moments for Team USA in Italy.The hockey final came down to seconds. Team USA trailed late against Canada in the gold-medal game on Thursday. Then Hilary Knight tipped a shot from Laila Edwards with just 124 seconds left to tie the game 1-1.In overtime, Megan Keller scored 4 minutes and 7 seconds in to seal a 2-1 win for the United States. The celebration was loud and emotional. This victory gave the U.S. women another Olympic hockey gold medal after years of close battles with Canada.With 95 events completed, Norway leads the table with 16 gold medals and 34 total medals.

Casey Wasserman, chairman of the LA28 Olympic organizing committee, faced public calls to step down during a gubernatorial forum in Sacramento. Several candidates answered “yes” when asked if he should resign.Curling is also under the spotlight. Reports earlier this month raised concerns about possible rule violations in ski jumping and other events. While officials called some claims rumors, the World Anti-Doping Agency said it would review any credible information. Coverage from Milan described this as a moment that could affect how athletes and teams are monitored moving forward.","The medal table continues to shift as Norway, the United States, and Italy battle for the top spots.

Playing at the same venue



Facing spin



Team news



New Zealand middle-order batter Mark Chapman looked perplexed when he was asked about the Super Eight groups, where all four table-toppers, who have done well in their respective groups, will end up facing each other. It has been done because of the pre-tournament seedings.The 31-year-old smiled and replied, “When it comes to scheduling and planning, that’s not really in my domain.”Chapman’s response sums up the way New Zealand play their cricket. No fuss, no theatrics, just straight down to business.After playing three matches in Chennai and one in Ahmedabad, all on red-soil pitches, the Kiwis had only one training session to adapt to the conditions ahead of their first Super Eight match against Pakistan at the R Premadasa Stadium.None of them rushed towards the pitch for a closer look. Once warm-ups were done, the players moved to the indoor nets. About an hour later, Daryl Mitchell came out barefoot to inspect the surface, spending a good fifteen minutes studying every inch of the 22 yards.Chapman, who did not get to see the surface, left it to the senior leadership group.“In the subcontinent, the toss always plays a factor depending on the conditions.I haven’t seen the pitch yet, so I don’t actually know what it looks like. There will be discussions behind the scenes with the senior leadership group about what we want to do,” he said.The black-soil pitches in Colombo do assist spinners, and with bigger boundaries and a slower outfield, it presents a new challenge for the 2021 T20 World Cup finalists.“We haven’t played in Sri Lanka yet. A lot of guys in our team have played a lot of cricket here, so I don’t see that playing too much of a factor. Guys understand what they need to do, and we are confident we will face whatever conditions are in front of us,” said Chapman, whose knees were heavily strapped.“In India, particularly on red-soil pitches, conditions have been favourable for batting. It has been tough for the bowlers, and the margins have been very small. We have seen scores close to 200 regularly.“Here, it is slightly different with the slower nature of the pitches. The bowlers will hopefully get a chance to show their skills, and spinners are more likely to play a part here,” he added.Although Pakistan are stationed in Sri Lanka, they played their group matches at two different venues in Colombo.New Zealand will be the only team playing all their Super Eight matches at the same venue, facing Pakistan on February 21, Sri Lanka on February 25, and England on February 27, all at the R Premadasa Stadium.“One of the challenges in tournaments like these is hopping from venue to venue and adapting. When we play three games at the same place, we learn with each game.“It is nice to turn up at the same venue with similar pitches and adjust. Tomorrow is our first game here, so we will have to adapt anyway, but we will understand the conditions better as we go,” he said.New Zealand’s first challenge will be Pakistan’s spin-heavy attack. Usman Tariq, Abrar Ahmad, Mohammad Nawaz, Saim Ayub, and Shadab Khan form a strong unit.“Pakistan have a number of very good spinners, each with their own threat. We have played them quite frequently over the last few years.“We are well aware of what they will bring. For us, it is about being really clear in how we want to play against them,” he said.Obviously, there was a Usman Tariq question: “Usman Tariq has a unique action with the way he pauses at the crease, so that is something to factor in.""Chapman, whose role is to take on spinners in the middle overs, explained why running between the wickets will be crucial.“Given the slower pitch and bigger boundaries, you have to change your game plan. Against spinners, it is about different options like the sweep or reverse sweep. In India, you can target straight boundaries more.“For me, it is about finding different areas of the ground. There are big pockets here, so it is not all about sixes. Twos, fours, and running between the wickets are very important, especially if it is not a high-scoring game,” he said.New Zealand have suffered injury setbacks. Michael Bracewell has been ruled out of the remainder of the tournament after re-injuring his left calf. Captain Mitchell Santner missed the last group match against Canada due to illness, while Lockie Ferguson returned home for the birth of his first child.“Mitchell Santner looks pretty sprightly and excited to get back on the park, barring any last-minute illness.“Lockie has just returned and is coming off a long flight. We will see how he pulls up. I cannot confirm whether he will be in the playing eleven,” Chapman said.","New Zealand will play all their Super Eight matches at the same venue, facing Pakistan on February 21, Sri Lanka on February 25, and England on February 27.

Cade Cunningham's shocked reaction after seeing multiple zeros in his bank account

Cade Cunningham's statistical impact and franchise expectations

One doesn’t always come across a mind blowing news while going out for a burger, but that’s what happened with Detroit Pistons’ superstar Cade Cunningham. Cunningham, in a talk with GQ, shared a candid moment that happened while he was waiting in a Sonic Drive-In line. It was a life-changing reality check when the 2021 #1 pick saw his bank account loaded with zeros, courtesy of his five-year rookie extension. He humorously noted that he could have ""bought the whole Sonic"" with that kind of money.The original contract increased from $224 million to $269 million after Cunningham triggered the NBA's Rose rule when he earned the All-Star honors in 2025. This contract is the largest deal in Pistons history and further cements Cunningham’s place as the franchise cornerstone.Cunningham recently appeared in his second consecutive All-Star game in LA and solidified himself as one of the greats in Piston’s franchise. What further encapsulates his importance for the team is his 5-year, $269 million maximum rookie extension he signed in 2024, which keeps him in Detroit through the 2029-30 season.In the latest interview with GQ, Cunningham revealed how the extension amount shocked him when he saw his bank account. He said, “I checked and that m* was loaded like crazy! I think we were going to Sonic or something. Could buy the whole Sonic, man!”The contract officially kicked in during the 2025-26 season, and is a reflection of the explosive growth of NBA salaries.Under the contract, Cade will earn an average annual salary of $53.8 million throughout the contract with 8% annual raises. For this season, he’s set to earn a base salary of $46.3 million, $50 million next season, followed by $53 million and $57 million. The biggest chunk comes in the final year when Cunningham will take home a whopping $61.2 million. These figures are nearly double of some veteran's total career earnings.The Pistons' decision to award Cunningham the max extension was driven by his 2023-24 campaign where he proved his elite productivity by averaging 22.7 points, 7.5 assists, and 4.3 rebounds per game while shooting 44.9% from the field. He followed with another outstanding year in 2025-25 where he dropped 26.1 PPG, 9.1 APG and 6.1 RPG.This season, the Pistons are leading the East with 41-13 and with their recent 126-111 win over the Knicks they have extended their winning streak to 4. Cunningham has remained a statistical outlier with his average 25.7points, 5.7 rebounds and 9.7 rebounds and efficient shooting of 46.3% from the floor. He also holds the franchise record for the most games with at least 25 points and 10 assists.By securing Cunningham through 2030, Detroit’s front office has tied up approximately 25% to 30% of their projected salary cap in a single player. The front office’s bet on this 6'6"" framed elite playmaker is wrapped with hope that he will eventually translate this trust into winning an NBA ring.","Cunningham recently appeared in his second consecutive All-Star game in LA.

Giza Pyramid: Satellite radar study reveals vast underground structures and hidden chambers beneath Egypt’s ancient monument,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/satellite-radar-study-claims-vast-underground-structures-beneath-the-giza-pyramid/articleshow/128546086.cms,"Satellite radar study claims vast underground structures beneath the Giza Pyramid

Synthetic aperture radar used to map subsurface features beneath the Pyramid of Khafre

Claims generate online interest and academic caution

Natural caves already exist beneath the Giza Plateau

Speculation links findings to ancient myths and older cultures

Cairo: PM Narendra Modi visits 'The Great Pyramid of Giza'





Reports emerging in March 2025 have drawn attention to fresh claims about hidden structures beneath the Pyramid of Khafre on the Giza plateau. An Italy-based research group, working with satellite radar imagery rather than ground excavation, says it has identified large underground features extending deep below the monument. The team used Synthetic Aperture Radar data gathered from orbiting satellites and processed it to produce composite images of subsurface density. Their interpretation points to vertical shafts and sizable chambers cut into the bedrock. The findings have not been verified through an on-site investigation. For now, they remain part of an ongoing debate about remote sensing methods, data interpretation and the long-studied geology of the Giza plateau in Egypt.The researchers relied on Synthetic Aperture Radar, often shortened to SAR. This technology sends radar signals from satellites in orbit. The signals reflect off the ground and are recorded, then processed using mathematical modelling. Variations in density and structure can appear as patterns in the final images.Based on this study, “What Really Lies Beneath the Pyramids?” , the team believes it can see eight deep cylindrical shafts beneath the pyramid.These are said to descend hundreds of metres into the limestone bedrock. At the lower end, the images appear to show two large cubic chambers. Inside the pyramid itself, five vertical voids are also suggested. It is an interpretation of patterns rather than a physical survey.The announcement moved quickly across social media platforms. Alternative history commentators gave it prominence. Videos and commentary circulated widely within days.Academic reaction has been more restrained. Egyptologists point out that satellite radar imagery can be complex. Image processing may produce shapes that resemble structures without confirming their material nature. Without drilling, excavation or ground-penetrating surveys, it is difficult to establish what lies below.The Giza plateau is not solid stone throughout. Limestone bedrock in the area contains natural cavities and fissures. Some caves have been explored in previous decades. Earlier geophysical surveys also detected voids in certain areas beneath the pyramids.Because of this, some researchers suggest the radar signatures could represent natural formations rather than engineered shafts. The difference matters. Geological voids are common in limestone terrain. The present claims do not yet clearly separate between natural and artificial origins.Beyond the technical dispute, some authors have made similarities between the suggested structures and the Duat, the nether region mentioned in funerary texts in ancient Egypt. Others go further and propose connections to Taş Tepeler-related prehistoric sites in Anatolia. These connections are yet theoretical. There is currently no archaeological evidence linking those previous cultures to the Giza plateau. For the time being, the radar investigation broadens the debate about Khafre's pyramid. It doesn't resolve the issue.","Satellite radar study claims vast underground structures beneath the Giza Pyramid.Synthetic aperture radar used to map subsurface features beneath the Pyramid of Khafre.Claims generate online interest and academic caution and caution.

Who will hit the Yankees’ first home run of the Grapefruit League season?

Aaron Judge and other proven middle-of-the-order sluggers

Austin Wells, Jazz Chisholm Jr., and the wildcard options

The New York Yankees are in Tampa, and while Grapefruit League games are finally around the corner, attention turns to one of the most frequent talking points of spring training: who will be the first player to hit a home run for the Yankees during the exhibition season. Wins and losses don't matter much in the month of February, but the crack of a bat and ball leaving the park to find nothing but air between the ball and the back wall always brings fans' attention, as well as the attention of those in the clubhouse.Early spring lineups are a mix of stars getting their wind back before the season and younger players who are looking to show that they belong on the roster. The combination of that leads to lots of chances at a longball early in the season, given how many pitchers are still building arm strength. Here are some of the most likely suspects among the Yankees who might make the first deposit into the team's spring power account. Yankees are scheduled to face Orioles tonight.If you rein in talk of Yankees power, the topic must start with Aaron Judge. Judge is such an imposing presence that even with limited spring at-bats, he can homer at any moment. We wouldn't be shocked if he hits the Yankees' first home run of the season as soon as a few early Grapefruit League at-bats come before things really get underway for him this spring.Cody Bellinger is another strong candidate. Those spring training ballparks are tailor-made for Bellinger's left-handed power (Bellinger likes to dial in his timing early in camp). That could get him a mistake pitch early in the games, and he has the ability to drive fastballs.Austin Wells has always been a more interesting option in the younger, versatile bat realm. Wells displayed good power for a rookie, and in spring training, catchers usually get a lot of early at-bats. When he steps to the plate in one of the early games in that scenario, he has a legitimate chance to get a big hit, thanks to his short but powerful swing.You could also throw in Jazz Chisholm Jr. Chisholm has earned a reputation for swing aggression and athleticism, and even if he does not make perfect contact, he doesn’t need much of an invitation to leave the yard. He has the requisite energy and attack angle to make an early-count pitch a classic spring-training home run opportunity.","The New York Yankees are in Tampa, and Grapefruit League games are finally around the corner.

Tarik Skubal net worth in 2026: Tracking the financial growth of one of baseball’s top left-handers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/mlb/news/tarik-skubal-net-worth-in-2026-tracking-the-financial-growth-of-one-of-baseballs-top-left-handers/articleshow/128612624.cms,"Tarik Skubal (Image Source: Getty)

Tarik Skubal’s arbitration win and its impact on net worth

What Skubal’s case means for pitchers and the market

As of February, Skubal's earnings hit headlines after a three-person arbitration panel ruled that he would receive a record $32 million salary for the 2026 season. The decision, which became the highest single-season arbitration award in Major League Baseball history, and the largest-ever amount awarded a pitcher through the process, dramatically altered the short-term financial perspective of perhaps the premier left-hander in the sport.Quite a journey for a pitcher whose career quickly advanced from an exciting piece in the rotation to shimmering in the Cy Young discussion and then topping it off with a contract that could have made him a franchise cornerstone. The Detroit ace initially settled for one year and $10.15 million to avoid arbitration for 2025, then decided to take his case to a hearing and prevailed. The end result was a 210% salary increase which fast-tracked his financial development and turned him into a free agent target on the horizon.According to publicly available salary data, by the time the 2026 season rolled around, Tarik Skubal had already made a lot of eight-figure range over the course of his career. His cumulative earnings through the 2025 season are estimated in the low-to-mid $20 million range by contract tracking services. This brings his gross career earnings over $50 million before his 30th birthday and now a $32 million arbitration award.But net worth does not equate to gross salary. Take-home is substantially diminished by federal and state taxes, agent commissions, which often are five to ten percent, and costs associated with a lifestyle. Based on those variables, the best guesstimate for Skubal's personal net worth at the point midway through the 2026 season is between $20 million and $35 million. The high end of that range presumes the most spendthrift lifestyle, no significant off-field business blow-ups and relatively low endorsement earnings, as a position-player superstar.The arbitration ruling has larger implications for teams and players alike beyond just Skubal himself. The award immediately adds pressure to the Detroit Tigers' payroll flexibility, but it also highlights how expensive it is to keep top-of-the-rotation arms that you cultivated yourself. Look for agents around the league to point to Skubal as a litmus test whenever the next arbitration-eligible ace comes up.And for Skubal himself, it could hardly have come at a better time. With free agency looming after the 2026 season, the left-hander now negotiates from a position of unprecedented power. Industry executives believe he could land a deal worth several hundred million dollars over the course of a decade if he continues to perform at an elite level. In that respect, those $32 million in arbitration dollars will one day be seen less as a high and more as a launching pad for Tarik Skubal's next phase of financial growth.","Detroit Tigers left-hander Tarik Skubal was awarded a record $32 million salary for the 2026 season.

NEW DELHI: India opener Abhishek Sharma has had a rough start in the T20 World Cup 2026, getting out for three ducks in a row in the group stage. His poor run has raised concerns, but the Indian team management is still backing him strongly.Team India bowling coach Morne Morkel dismissed any talk of dropping him and said, ""Absolutely no discussion on Abhishek Sharma in the group. He is going to deliver, for the team and viewers. He is entertaining. He is hitting the ball well in the nets.""Former India captain Sunil Gavaskar feels pressure is affecting the 25-year-old batter. He believes Abhishek is trying too hard to hit big shots from the first ball instead of settling in.“Abhishek Sharma is a lovely guy, but expectations seem to be weighing on him. If he had started well against the USA, it would have been different. Now, the pressure of being the big six-hitter and top batter is showing,"" Gavaskar said.""With his shot range, he needs to spend time in the middle. He cannot try to hit a boundary or six on the first ball of his innings. If the big shots come, fine. But he shouldn’t force himself to play the big shots across the line,” he added.He also advised Abhishek to start slowly and build his innings.“Take a single and get off the mark. Even four dot balls don’t matter. He can make up for them later. He needs to play smart. Spend an hour or two settling in, then play his natural game. First, just get off the mark. Every batter wants that first run. Once he gets it, everything will fall into place,” he added.Assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate also backed Abhishek and said he showed good form in training after recovering from illness.He said Abhishek batted well in the nets and should be fine in the next phase.With India reaching the Super 8s, the team hopes Abhishek will regain confidence and perform when it matters most.",India opener Abhishek Sharma has had a rough start in the T20 World Cup 2026.

T20 World Cup: Pakistan coach Mike Hesson on Babar Azam, Salman Ali Agha and Shaheen Shah Afridi

Look, it’s the role the team requires, and Babar is well aware of that. I think he’s well aware his strike rate in the powerplay in World Cups is less than 100 Mike Hesson

Pakistan head coach Mike Hesson did not mince words on Babar Azam ’s strike rate on the eve of their first Super Eight match against New Zealand at the R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo.There were doubts around Babar’s place in Pakistan’s side for the T20 World Cup following his horrible season in Australia’s Big Bash League, where he scored only 202 runs in 11 innings at a strike rate of 103.06. He hit just three sixes in the season and made scores of 14 or less in the eight matches he played.In Pakistan’s last group match against Namibia, he was not even sent in to bat at his usual position. When Salman Ali Agha was dismissed off the first ball of the 13th over, Khawaja Nafay was sent in. An over later, when Nafay got out, Shadab Khan walked out to bat, leaving Babar padded up in the dugout.“Look, it’s the role the team requires, and Babar is well aware of that. I think he’s well aware his strike rate in the powerplay in World Cups is less than 100,” Hesson said at the pre-match press conference.“We think he’s a fine player through the middle if required, especially if we’re in a bit of trouble. As we saw against the USA, once he gets set, he can increase his strike rate.We brought Babar back in for a specific role post the Asia Cup. We wanted some batsmanship through the middle, and he brings that for us.“The other day, when we got to the 12th over mark, Babar Azam was not the best person to come in. We have other options who can perform that role better at the end. Babar is the first to acknowledge that. He knows he has a certain set of skills the team requires, and at times other players can perform certain roles more efficiently,” he said.During the match against Namibia, Pakistan made two bold calls, dropping Shaheen Shah Afridi and demoting Babar from his designated position.When asked whether it was a paradigm shift after the loss to India, the coach said, “I wouldn’t say that. Salman Mirza deserved his opportunity. Babar was the first to recognise that when the left-arm spin was taking shape and the pitch was turning, it wasn’t smart to send out two right-handers. Once the left-arm spinner finished, Nafay went out to take the game on. That’s what we needed at that time. It was about roles, not a paradigm shift. ”Hesson also said Salman Mirza should have played ahead of Shaheen Afridi in the previous match as well. Shaheen had conceded 31 runs in two overs against India and was then dropped for the Namibia game.“We made a call that Salman Mirza was coming in for Shaheen, and he bowled incredibly well. To be fair, he was probably unlucky not to be playing the second and third games,” he said.The coach also cleared the air about his alleged rift with Salman Ali Agha after a video clip of an argument during the Namibia match went viral.“I got sent that video, and you guys have got that completely wrong. I was going over to talk to Salman about getting Nawaz to put the pads on as a left-hander. Agha was upset about getting out and threw his bottle on the ground. It had nothing to do with our conversation,” he explained.“Once the left-arm spinner finished, we spoke about Shadab going in and Nawaz getting his pads on. It was a very simple conversation.

Jeff Bezos: Jeff Bezos reportedly uninterested as Seattle Seahawks hit market with $7–$10 billion price tag,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/jeff-bezos-reportedly-uninterested-as-seattle-seahawks-hit-market-with-710-billion-price-tag/articleshow/128617335.cms,"Jeff Bezos

Why Jeff Bezos Won’t Buy the Seahawks Despite Super Bowl Win

Thursday Night Football

After years of ""will they, won’t they,"" the Estate of Paul G. Allen officially announced on February 18, 2026, that the Seattle Seahawks are on the market. This isn't a surprise move, when Paul Allen passed away in 2018, his will explicitly stated that his sports teams (including the NBA’s Portland Trail Blazers) must be sold, with the profits going toward his massive philanthropic projects.The timing couldn’t be better for the estate. The announcement came just ten days after the Seahawks won Super Bowl LX, beating the New England Patriots 29–13. Since the team is currently at the top of the world, its value has skyrocketed. Experts believe the final price tag could land between $7 billion and $10 billion, which would easily break the record for the most expensive sports team ever sold.For years, everyone assumed Jeff Bezos would be the one to sign the check. He has deep roots in Seattle, and he’s one of the few people on Earth who can afford an $8 billion purchase without blinking.However, the latest reports have confirmed that Bezos has ruled himself out. According to Dylan Byers, he is ""uninterested"" in pursuing the Seahawks at this time. There are a few theories as to why:Amazon holds the exclusive rights to, which creates a potential conflict of interest if its founder owns a team.Bezos recently moved his primary residence to Miami, signaling that he might be distancing himself from his Seattle-centric business ventures.Some believe he is holding out for a different team or is simply focusing on his space and yachting projects.This isn’t a case of the family wanting out of the business, it’s actually a legal requirement. When Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen passed away in 2018, his will stated that his professional sports teams including the Seahawks and the NBA’s Portland Trail Blazers must eventually be sold. The money from these sales will go for philanthropic causes. While his sister, Jody Allen, has been running the team for the last few years, the ""Super Bowl bump"" provided the perfect window to fulfill her brother's wishes.Now that the biggest name is off the board, the search is on for a billionaire who can meet the NFL's strict ownership rules. Names like Steve Ballmer (who already owns the Clippers) or Larry Ellison are often mentioned, but the NFL requires a single ""control owner"" to hold at least a 30% stake.The sale is expected to last throughout the 2026 offseason. Until then, the Seahawks remain the reigning champions, waiting to see who will lead them into their next era.","When Paul Allen passed away in 2018, his will stated that his professional sports teams including the Seahawks and the NBA’s Portland Trail Blazers must eventually be sold.

Does Freddie Freeman want to finish his career with the Dodgers?

Betts bounces back, pitching questions shape Dodgers outlook

Freddie Freeman isn't entertaining free-agency talk. As he works through the final years of his six-year contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers, the former MVP has made his position clear: he wants to finish his career in Los Angeles. With his contract set to expire through 2027, Freeman says he's focused on winning, not negotiating, despite speculation about his long-term future beginning to build.At age 35, Freeman has already created a legacy in two franchises. After 12 successful seasons with the Atlanta Braves, culminating in a World Series championship in 2021, he has added another chapter championship in LA. He set the single-season record for Doubles with the Dodgers in 2023, and earned the World Series MVP honors in 2024, securing back-to-back championships.Despite being in the final third of the contract, Freeman isn't pressing for an extension.“I love being here,"" Freeman said Thursday. ""I’m from Southern California. I've had a great time with fans. You guys treat me great. Everyone's treating my family good,” added Freeman.While talking to MLB.com's Sonja Chen, ""So that's out of my control. I'm not worried about another contract, not going to bring it up, not going to talk about it.I got two years left. I'm just an employee. I just do my job, and if they want me back, they want me back. But I think [president of baseball operations] Andrew [Friedman] and everyone knows that I love being here.""According to MLB.com's Sonja Chen, Freeman hopes to play until he's 40, hopefully without changing uniforms again.While Freeman’s future is a topic of interest, the Dodgers' main focus is still another title drive. Moreover, Mookie Betts is looking for a bounce-back season after his worst offensive season. Manager Dave Roberts expects Betts to get back on track to MVP. ""He will be in the (MVP) conversation this year,"" said Roberts, placing more emphasis on health than individual awards and team success.On the pitching side, reliever Evan Phillips is back after testifying of free agency, while there is a question regarding the Opening Day availability of Blake Snell. That could create a spot on the rotation for Justin Wrobleski. On the other hand, Jazz Chisholm Jr. has set for himself an ambitious goal of joining Shohei Ohtani in the 50-50 club, although a 40-40 season is more realistic. In Los Angeles, however, the message is simple: Freeman isn't thinking of an exit. He's planning a finish.",Freddie Freeman is in the final years of his six-year contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers. The 35-year-old says he wants to finish his career in Los Angeles.
