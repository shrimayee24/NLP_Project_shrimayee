During a drinks break in the 40th over of India's chase, KL Rahul spoke with Virat Kohli , appearing to encourage him to stay at the crease until the end. With India requiring 65 runs from 60 balls against Australia on Tuesday, KL Rahul took on the role of aggressor in this Champions Trophy semi-final in Dubai.Rahul quickly scored a four and a six in his next five deliveries to ease the pressure on Kohli. He then rotated the strike to Kohli when India needed 40 runs from 45 balls, with Kohli 16 runs away from his 52nd ODI century.Kohli, despite being in control throughout the chase, attempted an unnecessary slog sweep against Adam Zampa and was caught at long-on. This uncharacteristic dismissal visibly frustrated KL Rahul at the non-striker's end.""Main maar raha that naa (I was going after the bowling),"" Rahul told Kohli as he walked past him.In the dressing room, coach Gautam Gambhir was also left visibly upset and mumbled something to the support staff and players seated alongside him.After the match, KL Rahul revealed his conversation with Kohli. ""When I walked in and when I played 10-12 balls I told him that you're the batter that needs to go on and be there till the end. And let me try and hit or let me try and take one chance an over. Because like you said we only needed 6 runs and over. But 6 runs and over on that wicket seemed like 8-8.5. So, you had to take one chance and over, one boundary or one six,"" Rahul told Star Sports.""So, I told him that I will do that and why don't you just rotate the strike and be there because you're the set batter and it might be harder. If you get out another set batter comes it becomes a lot more harder. But yeah, he felt like it was in his range to hit and yeah he didn't time it well.""Rahul maintained his composure and finished unbeaten with 42 runs from 34 balls, securing the victory with a six in the 49th over's first ball. This win advanced India to their fifth Champions Trophy final. Hardik Pandya contributed with a quick 28 runs from 24 balls before his dismissal.Despite the one mistimed shot, Kohli's performance was exceptional. He formed a crucial 91-run partnership for the third wicket with Shreyas Iyer, who scored 45 runs, after the early dismissals of Rohit Sharma (28) and Shubman Gill (9).Although Australia were missing key players, India hadn't defeated them in ICC tournament knockouts since the 2011 World Cup quarterfinal.Kohli effectively handled leg-spinner Adam Zampa, who had previously troubled him. He utilised pull shots and drives between sweeper cover and mid-wicket for consistent scoring.After losing both Iyer and Axar Patel (27) in quick succession, Kohli reached his fifty in 53 balls. Glenn Maxwell dropped a catch when Kohli was on 51 off Cooper Connolly's bowling.Kohli's innings ended when India needed 40 runs to win, as he hit the ball to Ben Dwarshuis at long-on off Zampa's bowling.","Virat Kohli was 16 runs away from his 52nd ODI century.

'Nobody has a right to raise a finger on him'

NEW DELHI: The national president of All India Muslim Jamaat , Maulana Shahabuddin Razvi , on Wednesday criticised cricketer Mohammed Shami after a video of him drinking an energy drink during the Champions Trophy semifinal match against Australia in the UAE went viral, even as the Muslim community was observing Ramadan fasting.In a video shared by news agency ANI, Razvi stated, ""One of the compulsory duties is 'Roza' (fasting)...If any healthy man or woman doesn't observe 'roza', they will be a big criminal. A famous cricket personality of India, Mohammed Shami had water or some other beverage during a match.""Highlighting that Shami was physically fit to play, Razvi further said, ""People were watching him. If he is playing, it means he is healthy. In such a condition, he did not observe 'Roza' and even had water...This sends a wrong message among people.""""By not keeping 'roza', he has committed a crime. He should not do this. In the eyes of Shariat, he is a criminal. He will have to answer God.""NCP-SCP MLA Rohit Pawar came out in support of Shami, asserting that the Indian cricketer prioritises his performance over fasting. Pawar stressed that religion should not be intertwined with sports and highlighted that the Muslim community takes pride in Shami’s accomplishments.""While representing the country, if Mohammad Shami feels that his performance might get even slightly affected due to fasting and what if something happens, then he will never be able to sleep. He is a hardcore Indian who has made the team win many times. Religion should not be brought up in sports. If you ask any Muslim person today, he/she will say that they are proud of Mohammad Shami,"" Pawar stated.Executive Member of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, Maulana Khalid Rashid Farangi Mahli, defended Shami, stating that fasting is compulsory for Muslims, but there are exceptions.""It is compulsory for all Muslims to observe roza, especially in the month of Ramazan. However, Allah has clearly mentioned in the Quran that if a person is on a journey or not well, they have the option not to observe Roza. In the case of Mohammed Shami, he is on a tour, so he has the option not to observe Roza. Nobody has a right to raise a finger on him,"" he said.Shami delivered an impressive performance, conceding only 27 runs in his first seven overs. Utilising his experience, he outfoxed Australian batters with variations in speed, line and length, finishing with figures of 3/48 in 10 overs.","All India Muslim Jamaat national president Maulana Shahabuddin Razvi criticised cricketer Mohammed Shami after a video of him drinking an energy drink went viral.

Though she spent part of her childhood in Switzerland, her roots firmly planted themselves in Russia, where she grew up alongside her sisters, Anna and Maria.Tragically, Anastasia lost her mother to cancer in 2017, a heartbreak that further fueled her passion for cinema — a world her mother so deeply influenced.Anastasia isn’t just known for being Ovechkin’s wife — she’s carved out her own path in the world of modeling, acting, and film production. She graduated from the Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography in 2014 and later pursued an acting program at the New York Film Academy in Los Angeles.Her modeling career took off in Russia, with appearances in various high-end magazines, and she continues to be a familiar face both in front of the camera and behind the scenes, blending beauty with brains and creativity.Their love story is straight out of a rom-com. Anastasia and Alexander first crossed paths at the 2008 Beijing Olympics but didn't start dating until 2014 — thanks to a little social media magic. A few DMs and heart-fluttering conversations later, the pair reconnected and didn’t look back.Fast forward to July 2016, and the couple tied the knot in an intimate ceremony, only to follow it up with a lavish celebration in July 2017 at the Barvikha Luxury Village near Moscow. Talk about a fairytale wedding!Family means everything to the Ovechkins. The couple are proud parents to two adorable sons — Sergei Aleksandrovich Ovechkin (born August 2018) and Ilya Aleksandrovich Ovechkin (born May 2020). Their first son was named in honor of Alexander's late brother, adding a heartfelt layer to their family story.While Anastasia is often recognized as the wife of one of the NHL's greatest players, she’s more than just a hockey wife — she’s a model, actress, and loving mother, all while supporting Alexander as he chases hockey history.So next time Ovi lights up the scoreboard, just remember — there's an equally impressive force cheering him on from the stands.Also read - Can Alex Ovechkin Overtake Wayne Gretzky's Goal Record With 20 Games Left in the NHL Season?","Anastasia Shubskaya is the wife of NHL star Alexander Ovechkin.

The Los Angeles Lakers are making strategic moves as they gear up for the playoffs, with reports indicating that Jordan Goodwin ’s two-way contract will soon be converted into a standard NBA deal. This decision comes as the team continues its impressive run, winning seven straight games and 18 of their last 21. To make room for Goodwin, the Lakers are likely to waive either Cam Reddish or Alex Len, with Reddish being the more probable candidate.Jordan Goodwin, a 26-year-old guard, has quickly become a valuable asset for the Los Angeles Lakers since joining the team in early February. Over eight games, he has averaged 6.1 points, 3.8 rebounds, and 1.0 assist in 16.9 minutes per game. Despite a recent right ankle sprain slowing his momentum, Goodwin’s contributions have not gone unnoticed. Head coach JJ Redick has repeatedly praised him, calling him a key rotation player.According to The Athletic’s Jovan Buha, the Los Angeles Lakers are expected to convert Goodwin’s contract as late as possible to maximize financial flexibility. ""I do expect him to be converted at the end of the season as late as possible, and then be on the playoff roster. ... He's kind of become the 9th man, and you could argue that depending on the night and depending on the matchup, he should be like the 8th man,"" Buha said on his podcast . He also hinted at a potential multi-year deal for Goodwin in the future, stating, ""I think he's going to get a multi-year contract, longer-term later in the season.""Jordan Goodwin’s journey to the Lakers began after they waived Armel Traore to open a roster spot. A four-year NBA veteran, he has previously played for Washington, Phoenix, and Memphis, holding career averages of 6.4 points, 3.8 rebounds, and 2.6 assists across 128 games. His versatility and defensive prowess have made him a reliable option off the bench.Also read: NBA Buyout Rumors: Los Angeles Lakers could bag $33 million ex-Toronton Raptors star to bolster squad's defensive end As the Los Angeles Lakers continue their push for playoff success, the decision to convert Jordan Goodwin’s contract reflects their commitment to strengthening their roster.

"""Playing on a horrible team"": Blackhawks Coach sparks outrage with bold response to Connor Bedard’s struggles",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/playing-on-a-horrible-team-blackhawks-coach-sparks-outrage-with-bold-response-to-connor-bedards-struggles/articleshow/118760648.cms,"Image via Getty Images

Firing of Coach Luke Richardson sparks questions about Connor Bedard’s development

Chicago Blackhawks fans are upset with interim head coach Anders Sorensen after his blunt comments about Connor Bedard’s performance. Following a close 4-3 loss to the Minnesota Wild in December 2024, Sorensen criticized Connor Bedard and the team, urging them to be more aggressive offensively. Many fans felt this public criticism could hurt Bedard’s confidence rather than help his development.The situation has been made worse by the Blackhawks' overall struggles this season. In December 2024, the team fired head coach Luke Richardson, reportedly due to their poor performance and possibly his handling of Connor Bedard. With the team struggling in the standings, fans are growing increasingly concerned about the direction of the franchise and whether Bedard, seen as the future of the team, is being properly supported.Blackhawks beat reporter Ben Pope provided insight into Connor Bedard’s recent struggles, pointing out that despite Chicago scoring 16 goals over three games, Bedard failed to record a single point. “The Blackhawks have scored 16 goals the last 3 games yet Connor Bedard has 0 points, which is wild,” Pope posted on social media.“He knows he’s getting chances; he knows he’s setting up some chances,” said the head coach, but fans straight up disagreed. “He ain’t getting any chances at all, he’s way too slow,” one fan commented in direct contradiction of the coach’s statement.“I realize that Bedard is just 19 and playing on a horrible team, but he was terrible in the Kings game—terrible in all three zones. He should visit Donato’s skating coach in the offseason. He needs to get faster, stronger, smarter,” another fan commented.Coach Sorensen believes Connor Bedard is making the right plays but has struggled to find the net, even in the Blackhawks’ 5-1 win over the L.A. Kings. Goalie Spencer Knight stole the spotlight, making 41 saves, while Bedard praised his new teammate.However, fans were less forgiving, pointing out Bedard’s struggles in all three zones. Some suggested he needs to work on his speed, strength, and overall game to improve his impact on the ice.Concerns about Connor Bedard’s development are growing as he struggles while Ryan Donato thrives. Fans say he needs to improve his speed and skating, while critics also target Coach Sorensen’s “boring” approach. Analyst Greg Wyshynski even suggests Bedard could seek a trade if the Blackhawks remain mismanaged.Also Read: “Keep shooting and keep believing”: Auston Matthews addresses significant drop in goal scoring for the Maple Leafs As criticism of Connor Bedard grows and the Blackhawks struggle, concerns about his development and future in Chicago intensify.

Canucks' coach scoffs at Brady Tkachuk’s Quinn Hughes comments

BRADY TKACHUK & JON COOPER Join the Show - Ep. 547

Brady Tkachuk recently called out the Vancouver Canucks , suggesting they blocked Quinn Hughes from playing in the 4 Nations Face-Off for Team USA. Hughes had been recovering from an oblique injury since January 31, and despite speculation that he might join the tournament, he ultimately sat out.Brady Tkachuk implied on the Spittin' Chiclets podcast that Quinn Hughes wanted to play but wasn't cleared by the Vancouver Canucks, calling it ""shady business."" However, the Canucks maintain that Hughes' absence was purely due to his injury and recovery process.According to NHL reporter Noah Strang, Canucks coach Rick Tocchet simply laughed off Brady Tkachuk’s comments about Vancouver blocking Quinn Hughes from playing in the 4 Nations Face-Off. Strang posted on X, “Rick Tocchet says they laugh at Brady Tkachuk’s notion that #Canucks not letting Hughes play at 4 Nations was ‘shady business’. We can’t even play the guy, so how was he going to play for the Americans?”Quinn Hughes was off the ice from Jan 31 to Feb 26, making Brady Tkachuk’s claim questionable. Since returning, he’s played three games, with two losses and one assist. His injury remains unchanged, suggesting health, not interference, kept him out.Brady Tkachuk didn’t hold back when he appeared on Spittin’ Chiclets’ YouTube channel, sharing strong opinions on the 4 Nations Face-Off and the Quinn Hughes situation. “I actually FaceTimed Quinn. Kinda like when he was figuring it out when people were like, ‘Quinn might come, Quinn might not come, ’” Brady said.He continued, “I think he was all about coming, but I just don’t think he got cleared by Vancouver to play. So, it’s a little shady business to begin with. We all know who they are cheering for.” This triggered a response from Rick Tocchet.Quinn Hughes is out against the Ducks after a lower-body injury in Saturday’s Kraken game. He missed the final 9:05, skipped practice Sunday, and left Tuesday’s session early. Coach Tocchet says they’ll monitor his recovery daily.Quinn Hughes has 60 points in 50 games this season, ranking 143rd in goals but excelling in assists, placing him among the top 11 defensemen. He’s 29th overall in points. Coach Tocchet admitted Hughes hasn’t been himself lately, saying, “Eighty percent Quinn, we’ll take, but we have to be careful.” His future this season remains uncertain.Also Read: “Pretty cool feeling”: Brady Tkachuk gave his take on USA-Canada 4 Nations Face-Off fights, deemed team USA as villains With Hughes battling injuries and not at his best, his season’s trajectory remains uncertain.

Winnie Harlow: My Engagement Story (Full Episode)

Milwaukee Bucks starhas recently reacted to his fiancéeas she details the 29-year-old forward’s proposal in a recent interview. Recently, Kuzma took a significant step in his relationship, proposing to longtime girlfriend Winnie Harlow in a beautifully orchestrated moment that left the model in tears. The couple, who have been dating since 2020, shared their engagement story, revealing the intimate details of Kuzma’s grand yet heartfelt gesture.During her guest appearance on Call Her Daddy, model and entrepreneur Winnie Harlow shared the story behind her engagement to NBA star Kyle Kuzma . Before the episode aired, the podcast released a teaser where she hinted at the special moment. Kuzma later reacted to the clip on his Instagram story, playfully teasing the reveal with a laughing emoji and writing, “Can’t wait to watch it,” while tagging his fiancée.Speaking on Alex Cooper’s Call Her Daddy podcast, Harlow confessed, “I was the last one to know about it. Everyone on my whole team was like, ‘Did you not realize that we’ve been avoiding you for the last two weeks?’”The surprise began before they even reached their destination. Kuzma had rented a private jet and decorated it lavishly with roses, chocolates, balloons, and champagne, setting the tone for a magical moment. “I was the last one to know about it,” she said of the proposal. ""Everyone on my whole team was like, ‘Did you not realize that we’ve been avoiding you for the last two weeks?’ I was like, ‘Well, I was none the wiser,’” Harlow added.As they boarded the decorated jet, Harlow was already moved to tears. But the real surprise came when Kuzma pulled out a heartfelt poem he had written for her. The model had once jokingly asked Kuzma to send her a love letter, not realizing he would turn it into one of the most meaningful moments of their relationship.“I was like, ‘Write me a love letter, my sergeant. Send me a love letter,’ and it was just a joke, you know, but he took that and wrote me a love letter to propose,” Harlow shared. At the end of the poem, instead of the expected question, “Will you be my Valentine?” Kuzma instead asked, “Will you be my wife?”“I literally just went into shock,” she admitted. “I was already crying and just flooded with tears at that point. He pulled out the box, got on one knee, and I was like, ‘Yes. I don’t even need to see it … Yes, yes, yes.’”Kuzma had been planning the proposal for six months. He even arranged for Harlow’s nail technician to fly from Los Angeles to Washington, D.C., to make sure she had her nails done before the big moment. The centerpiece of the proposal was an 8.5-carat oval-cut diamond ring, which Kuzma spent three months designing. “I just wanted to draw a picture of what I felt resembled her—something that was elegant, but very timeless and simplistic at the same time,” he told Vogue.Initially, Kuzma had planned to propose in Turks and Caicos with both of their families present, but at the last moment, he decided to keep it intimate and pop the question on the plane. “I love that he did that. It was so beautiful, so romantic, it was just him and I,” Harlow said.Also Read: Giannis Antetokounmpo gives honest reaction after joining elite 20,000 points club Harlow and Kuzma’s love story began in 2020, but it almost didn’t happen.

According to WPBF sports anchor Yianni Kourakis, Allen and his close circle of friends, including his brother Jason Allen, headed to the Sunshine State to kick off the celebrations. Given Allen’s love for golf, it was no surprise that the event was centered around the sport, particularly at the TGL event on March 4.The star-studded bachelor trip included some notable NFL names, such as Minnesota Vikings quarterback Sam Darnold, Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Kyle Allen, Jacksonville Jaguars wide receiver Christian Kirk, and Buffalo Bills tight end Dalton Kincaid. Interestingly, Allen had previously mentioned Darnold, Kirk, and Kyle Allen as his “dream golf foursome” in a CBS Sports interview last summer, making this gathering all the more special.The group attended the TGL match featuring Tiger Woods ' Jupiter Links Golf Club taking on Atlanta Drive GC, and they weren’t shy about getting into the spirit of the game. While the new golf league promises a unique and intense atmosphere, Allen and his friends embraced the fun, even getting a bit rowdy with their energetic reactions.During ESPN’s coverage of the event, Allen was interviewed about his offseason plans. When asked what he had in store, he responded with a perfectly timed and thoughtful answer:“Honestly, doing … listen, doing whatever my fiancée wants to do right now. I’m a smart man, I get it. She was in Buffalo this last past season. Whatever I can do to help out I’m going to do.”That’s exactly the kind of response one would expect from an MVP—both on and off the field. While he enjoyed his time with the guys, he made it clear that Steinfeld remains his top priority.The actress, who has been turning heads with her stunning looks recently, was busy making waves at the Oscars while Allen attended the golf event. Despite their time apart, the couple has been inseparable, sharing a passionate moment at the NFL Honors 2025 show with a public display of affection.While Allen is making the most of his offseason with golf outings and time with friends, he remains devoted to supporting Steinfeld in her endeavors. Just last month, he joined her in Italy for Milan Fashion Week and attended her ""Angel Margarita"" launch party. As for his own passions, Allen has already committed to competing in the American Century Celebrity Golf Championship in July.Also Read: Eagles GM Howie Roseman compares winning Super Bowls to sex in bold NSFW remark From leading the Bills on the field to balancing love and leisure off it, Josh Allen is proving that he can quarterback both his career and personal life with equal success.","Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen was named NFL 2024 MVP.

John Cena Sr. Breaks Silence On His Son’s Shocking WWE Heel Turn

The WWE world is still reeling from John Cena’s drastic betrayal against Cody Rhodes at the night of Elimination Chamber 2025. The 16-time world champion shook the arena by aligning himself with The Rock and turning his back against Rhodes. While fans are divided by this monumental shift in the storyline, one person has grown tired of addressing the shocking Heel turn of Cena, and it's none other than Cena’s father. John Cena Sr. recently revealed his frustration about the repetitive asking of questions regarding his son’s groundbreaking actions that caught everyone’s attention.In a recent conversation with SportsKeeda Wrestle Binge , Cena’s father addressed the question that everyone is talking about. Why did Cena do it? Well, The Champ’s father is one of many who do not know the answer to this; instead, his father's abrupt reaction to the question has hinted towards him masking his frustration regarding the shocking turn of events his son played a part in. Cena Sr. stated, “I’m tired of the other phone calls I’m getting. I don’t know why he did what he did. You’re gonna have to get that from him. I’m so tired of this. Why don’t we just let it play out and find out what’s happening?”While this was the only thing Cena’s father had to say about the historical shift that happened at the grand event, one of Cena’s close friends also had a different reaction about Cena’s actions when he was approached with the same question. Maxwell Jacob Friedman, or MJF, is one of many who loved this drastic change of events; he stated, ""John Cena is a good friend of mine. I get really annoyed when people in either company pretend that they don't....let me put it this way. Yes, I was watching it. I was watching it live. It was an awesome moment and everybody should think it was an awesome moment because it was.”As Cena turning Heel is indeed one of the most shocking moments of his entire wrestling career, it has surely brought about a tsunami of speculations among the fandom and the industry alike. While we continue to evaluate the reasons behind this significant switch by the Champ, we cannot contain the excitement and curiosity to witness how the events unfold in the future as WrestleMania 41 is not too far from reach.Also Read: Samoan Fury: The Unleashing of Solo Sikoa in WWE- Early Life, Career Highlights, and Achievements",John Cena Sr. recently revealed his frustration about the repetitive asking of questions regarding his son’s groundbreaking actions.

Portland Trail Blazers injury report for tonight’s game against the Boston Celtics (March 5, 2025)

How to watch the Boston Celtics play tonight against the Portland Trail Blazers (March 5, 2025)

The Boston Celtics will face the Portland Trail Blazers on Wednesday, March 5, at TD Garden, but all eyes are on star forward Jayson Tatum, who is listed as questionable due to a shoulder injury. The Celtics, currently 43-18 and holding a strong position in the league, are monitoring six players on their injury report, with Tatum’s status being the most critical ahead of the 7 p.m. ET tipoff. Jayson Tatum might not play tonight as he is listed as GTD on the team’s injury report. The Boston Celtics’ leading scorer averaging 26.8 points per game (sixth in the NBA), has been a cornerstone of the team’s success this season. His potential absence could significantly impact the team’s offensive firepower, especially against a Trail Blazers squad that has struggled defensively, ranking 18th in the league by allowing 114.2 points per game. Over the last 20 games, Jayson Tatum has been stellar, posting averages of 24.9 points, 8 rebounds, and 6.8 assists while shooting 37% from beyond the arc.The Celtics’ injury report also includes Jaylen Brown (questionable, illness), Kristaps Porzingis (day-to-day, illness), and Jrue Holiday (day-to-day, hand). Derrick White and Payton Pritchard are listed as probable, providing some depth if Tatum is sidelined. Boston’s depth will be tested, but their league-leading three-point shooting (17.8 made threes per game) could help offset any missing production.On the other side, the Trail Blazers (28-34) are dealing with their own injury woes. Key players like Matisse Thybulle (ankle), Deandre Ayton (calf), and Robert Williams III (knee) are out, while Jerami Grant (knee) is questionable. Anfernee Simons, Portland’s leading scorer at 19 points per game, will need to step up to challenge Boston’s third-ranked defense, which allows just 108.2 points per game.The Celtics have dominated opponents this season with a +522 scoring differential, outscoring teams by 8.6 points per game. Jayson Tatum’s ability to stretch the floor with his three-point shooting (3.6 made threes per game, fourth in the NBA) has been a key factor in their success. If he’s unable to play, the Celtics will rely heavily on Brown and Porzingis to carry the offensive load.Also read: Will Darius Garland play tonight against the Miami Heat?

Ovechkin has been actively involved in cancer awareness efforts for years, frequently visiting children’s hospitals and meeting young fans battling the disease.Ovechkin has 21 games left in the regular season. That’s plenty of time to close the gap and surpass Gretzky before the Stanley Cup Playoffs. If he doesn’t make it this season, he still has all of next year to shatter the record.

Jared Goff Hits Clips Vs. Pistons Game Date Night With Pregnant Christen: More Drama Than a Real Housewives Reunion

Forget the Super Bowl, folks, the real action was courtside at the Intuit Dome!

Think of it as their last hurrah before the baby arrives, a final ""pre-game"" before the real game of parenthood begins.Now, Jared, bless his heart, decided to rep his Detroit roots with a Tigers cap, a move that probably felt like wearing a Darth Vader mask to a Jedi convention in LA. Talk about bold! But hey, even in the heart of Clipper Nation, the man's got star power. Fans swarmed him like he was handing out golden tickets to Willy Wonka's factory, and he even got to hobnob with Pistons royalty, Rip Hamilton and Jalen Rose. It was a Space Jam moment, but instead of cartoon characters, it was legendary Pistons.Christen, glowing like a Bridgerton debutante, kept her baby bump chicly hidden under a leather jacket, proving that maternity style can be as iconic as a Beyoncé concert.

Gautam Gambhir hits out at critics after India beat Australia to reach Champions Trophy final

DUBAI: Indian pacer Mohammed Shami ’s call to remove the ban on saliva so that fast bowlers can generate reverse swing again, has found many takers. Shami’s appeal finds resonance among experts as there is a feeling to restore some sort of a level-playing field.Former India fast bowler and ex-national selector Salil Ankola told TOI: “They should do away with this ban now. I completely second Shami on that. You have got everything going for the batters, at least something should be there for the bowlers too.” Ankola, who played 20 ODIs for India, mentioned how this ban remains on most bowlers’ minds.“I was talking about it while commentating in the Ranji Trophy finals recently. The use of saliva to shine the ball has been going on for a century! It was not even banned in 1920, when a pandemic struck! Covid is over now. It’s time to do away with it,” he said.While they had first imposed the ban on using saliva to polish the ball in May 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic, in September 2022, the ICC made the ban permanent.Shami’s appeal to the game’s authorities has been also backed by two former international bowlers in South Africa’s Vernon Philander and New Zealand’s Tim Southee , who feel that allowing bowlers to use saliva will give a rebirth to reverse swing, currently missing from the game, especially on flat surfaces, on which most of One-day cricket is played on these days.“I think as a bowler, you want to have a slight advantage. We see the game going the way it’s going and seeing sides score 362 (New Zealand’s semifinal total against South Africa) and often, over 300 in this format. I think there needs to be something in the bowlers’ favour, and whether that’s a little bit of saliva. I don’t see why they couldn’t afford to get that back in,” Southee said on ESPNcricinfo’s Match Day.Philander said, “If we look at the state of that ball, towards the back end, it was really scuffed up. And I think had you used the saliva (to polish one side of the ball), the element of the reverse swing might have come into play.”‘Need to be cautious while lifting ban’However, there was a voice of caution too.“While I think that Shami has made a very valid call, we need to have a harder look at this issue before arriving at a decision,” former India pacer Venkatesh Prasad said.“The ban on applying saliva on the ball was also about maintaining cleanliness. Anything can happen today, we don’t know how many and when a new virus enters the air. So, I think you need to be very careful in making a decision about lifting the ban.”",Mohammed Shami has called on the ICC to remove the ban on saliva.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

Rob Gronkowski Drops a Surprise Pick for the Hardest Tight End to Tackle—And It’s Not Travis Kelce!



Ranking the The Hardest-Hitting Tight Ends & O-Lines in Football | Dudes On Dudes

George Kittle’s Monster Season and Contract Implications



The 2024 NFL season was anticipated to be a breakthrough year for tight ends, but despite several players having standout campaigns, the expected takeover didn’t fully materialize. Among those who continued to deliver strong performances was Travis Kelce . However, his numbers reflected a decline from his usual elite standards, highlighting the rise of another dominant force—George Kittle.At 35, Travis Kelce’s impact remained significant, but his production dipped compared to his previous seasons. With 97 receptions, his catch total ranked 12th in the league, yet his 823 receiving yards and 8.5 yards per reception were his lowest since his rookie season. The decline in explosiveness was evident as Kelce transitioned into more of a short-yardage safety valve rather than the dynamic open-field threat he once was.This shift played a role in his omission from the Dudes on Dudes podcast’s All-Dude first team. Rob Gronkowski and Julian Edelman had no hesitation in naming Kittle as their top tight end. Gronkowski explained their reasoning by praising Kittle’s relentless effort and physicality on the field.“I truly believe [George Kittle] earned it this year… George is in his 30s now, and the way that he plays the game, he still plays it like he’s 22 years old out on that field. He’s running hard. It’s hard to tackle him, and he’s blocking like an absolute vicious maniac out there… he’s giving it his all every play, and he’s a leader.”Despite missing two games due to a hamstring injury, Kittle’s numbers were among the best at the position. His 1,106 receiving yards were the second-highest of his career, while his 78 catches and eight touchdowns further solidified his status as an elite tight end. His ability to stretch the field was unmatched, leading all tight ends with 14.2 yards per reception.Recognized for his outstanding season, Kittle earned second-team All-Pro honors, a Pro Bowl selection, and the Len Eshmont Award as the 49ers' most valuable player. Head coach Kyle Shanahan acknowledged his vital role in the team’s success.“He’s had a hell of a year. He’s been able to stay healthy, too. He’s missed two games, I believe, which were obviously tough without him. But I’ve just been proud of how he’s taken care of himself, the way he comes to work every single day. I love being around George and love having him on our team.”As George Kittle remains one of the NFL’s premier tight ends, his contract situation becomes a key discussion point. The 49ers have restructured his five-year, $75 million extension multiple times to create cap space. However, in 2025, he is set to carry a cap hit of $22.085 million—nearly $10 million more than his previous high. A contract extension seems like the logical solution for both the team and the player.Kittle has made it clear that he envisions finishing his career with the 49ers.“Whatever the front office wants to do, I’m all ears,” he told ESPN.Beyond financial considerations, Kittle’s career trajectory continues to trend toward greatness. In 2024, he surpassed 7,380 receiving yards, setting a 49ers franchise record for tight ends and ranking second only to Kelce for the most receiving yards at the position through eight seasons. His name is now firmly etched among legends, joining the likes of Tony Gonzalez, Jason Witten, and Rob Gronkowski as one of only five tight ends with four 1,000-yard seasons.Each season, Kittle sets personal goals—1,000 receiving yards, 10 touchdowns, and 75 receptions. If he maintains this pace for three more years, he would cement his legacy among the top six tight ends in history. Paired with his elite blocking ability, this would almost guarantee a Hall of Fame induction, though Kittle remains focused on the present.“It’s always been until the wheels fall off,” he stated. “Or until my wife tells me to stop playing, which I’ll trust her on that one.”Also Read: ""Zip it"": Joe Burrow gets ruthlessly trolled for ""overconfident"" remarks in resurfaced interviews and faces criticism With no signs of slowing down, Kittle is on a path to not only make his place as a 49ers legend but also stake his claim as one of the greatest tight ends in NFL history.","Travis Kelce's numbers reflected a decline from his usual elite standards.

Gautam Gambhir hits out at critics after India beat Australia to reach Champions Trophy final

Virat Kohli steers India to third consecutive Champions Trophy final

NEW DELHI: The outcome of Sunday’s ICC Champions Trophy final is likely to form the base for Indian cricket’s preparation for the ODI World Cup in 2027 and the next World Test Championship (WTC) cycle.It could determine the future course for captain Rohit Sharma with the Indian cricket board (BCCI) keen on having a stable leadership while planning the coming two years.According to sources, there could be a tough discussion over moving on from Rohit at least as captain in ODIs and Tests. The board has also held back announcing the fresh central contracts and will wait for the final against New Zealand. TOI understands chief selector Ajit Agarkar and head coach Gautam Gambhir have already discussed the proposition with the board and Rohit after returning from the Australia tour. It is also learnt that during the meeting, the Indian captain was not averse to the idea of setting a roadmap for the team once the Champions Trophy ends.“Rohit still believes there is some cricket left in him. He has been told to communicate his plans going forward. Retiring is his call but there will be another discussion around continuing with captaincy. Rohit himself understands the need to have a stable captain if the team wants to prepare for a World Cup. There have been talks with Kohli too but there doesn’t seem to be much anxiety around him,” a BCCI source told TOI.BCCI usually announces its annual player retainership before the IPL. The board wanted to see how the team fared in the Champions Trophy after a disastrous Test season.It is learnt that the board wanted to revisit the Grade A+ contracts. Currently, Rohit, Kohli, Jasprit Bumrah and Ravindra Jadeja make up the top grade.With BCCI’s policy suggesting that players performing in all three formats are preferred for A+ contracts, there were some concerns with Rohit, Kohli and Jadeja retiring from T20Is and also enduring a very rough Test season. However, a strong showing in the Champions Trophy could help these players retain the marquee contract.It will be interesting to see if Axar Patel, KL Rahul and Rishabh Pant are promoted to A category. Shreyas Iyer is likely to win back his central contract after he was removed last year due to disciplinary issues. Kohli has sort of strengthened his case with a superlative show in the Champions Trophy so far.“The board will wait for Rohit’s decision after the Champions Trophy. If by any chance he chooses to retire, then the board will see what needs to be done. One can’t discount the fact that he won the T20 World Cup in July and has led well in the Champions Trophy as well,” the source said.Interestingly, MS Dhoni had quit white-ball captaincy two years before the 2019 World Cup which gave Kohli time to ease into the role.Kohli too stepped down as white-ball captain in 2021, leaving Rohit two years to run the team before the 2023 ODI World Cup.Factoring in that current ODI vice-captain Shubman Gill is still raw as a captain and Jasprit Bumrah’s persisting fitness issues, the selectors will need more time if they have to move on from Rohit.",The outcome of Sunday's ICC Champions Trophy final is likely to form the base for Indian cricket’s preparation for the ODI World Cup in 2027 and the next World Test Championship (WTC) cycle. It could determine the future course for captain Rohit Sharma with the Indian cricket board (BCCI) keen on having a stable leadership.
