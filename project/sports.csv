NEW DELHI: The RSS-backed ABVP bagged three key positions, including that of president, in the fiercely contested Delhi University Students' Union (Dusu) elections while the Congress-backed NSUI, which held the top post last year, managed to secure just one. The counting of votes took place Friday.ABVP's Aryan Maan won the president's post, receiving 28,841 votes to defeat NSUI's Joslyn Nandita Choudhary (12,645 votes) by a margin of 16,196 votes. NSUI's Rahul Jhansla emerged victorious as vice-president, getting 29,339 votes to defeat ABVP's Govind Tanwar, who managed 20,547 votes. ABVP's Kunal Chaudhary secured 23,779 votes to win the secretary's post, defeating NSUI's Kabir, while Deepika Jha claimed the joint secretary's post with 21,825 votes, overcoming NSUI's Lavkush Bhadana.ABVP's vote share climbed from 34.7% to 48.1%, its highest in over a decade.""The students of DU have sent a strong message... they trust us,"" Maan said after the victory, draped in the tricolour and surrounded by his jubilant supporters. He promised his first priority as president would be to push for concessional metro passes for students, a long-standing demand across colleges. ""We will work for every student and address all their concerns,"" he said.Aryan Maan's victory on Friday in the Dusu elections carried particular significance, not only because it reclaimed the top post for ABVP after last year's loss, but also because of its scale. The margin for the presidential race leapt from just 1,343 votes in 2024 to over 16,000 this year, a more than 12-fold increase.As the results trickled in at Delhi University Sports Centre in North Campus, the streets echoed with applause and cheers. Outside, supporters gathered, chanting ""Maan, Maan"" as the newly-elected president was hoisted onto the shoulders of his followers, waving the tricolour.A large crowd showered flower petals on the winners as they reached the Arts Faculty. In line with Delhi High Court's directives, the usual fanfare of firecrackers and dhols was largely absent, though occasional drumbeats could be heard. However, ABVP clarified it was not responsible for these. At the Arts Faculty, the winners posed before the Swami Vivekananda statue soon after, continuing a long-standing campus tradition.NSUI's Rahul Jhansla, who had the highest vote tally among all winners, outlined his priorities with quiet determination: ""My top priority is to launch mental health initiatives, with at least one counsellor in every college. I have been raising student issues for six years, and I will continue to stand up for them.""ABVP's Kunal Chaudhary expressed gratitude to the student body, saying, ""I thank every DU student with folded hands - this victory is because of them. My focus will be on getting Wi-Fi installed across colleges and pursuing metro travel concessions.""Deepika Jha, also from ABVP, called the moment ""emotional and proud"". ""For women students, we will work to create girls' common rooms in all colleges and ensure regular patrolling outside girls' colleges,"" she said, as supporters showered her with garlands.Among the AISA-SFI candidates, Anjali received 5,385 votes for president, Sohan Kumar secured 4,163 votes for vice-president, Abhinandana Pratyashi got 9,535 votes for secretary and Abhishek Kumar garnered 8,425 votes for joint secretary.In 2024, NSUI won the president's post after a seven-year gap. Its national president Varun Choudhary wrote on X: ""NSUI fought well... not just against ABVP, but against the combined force of DU admin, Delhi govt, central govt, RSS-BJP & Delhi Police. Yet thousands of DU students stood firmly with us.""Since its start in 1954, the Dusu elections have been a cornerstone of student politics, influencing discourse across the university's 52 affiliated colleges. Over the years, ABVP has emerged as a dominant force, notably sweeping all four key posts in 2015 and continuing its strong performance by winning three major positions in 2016, 2018, 2019 and 2023. Yet, NSUI has remained a persistent challenger, achieving a major breakthrough in 2017 by securing two posts and frequently claiming the vice-president position in subsequent years, consolidating its presence on campus.Voter turnout this year rose to 39.4% from 35.2% in 2024. Turnout has reflected the shifting tides of student engagement, ranging from 36.9% in 2016 to a peak of 43.8% in 2018. These variations underscore the competitiveness of DU politics, with Dusu serving as a microcosm of broader democratic processes in the country.The ""None of the Above"" (NOTA) option drew notable support in the DUSU elections for 2025-26, with 23,674 students opting for it across the four posts. This surge highlighted a clear sense of discontent among the student electorate.","The RSS-backed ABVP bagged three key positions, including that of president.

Navigating the boss labyrinth,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/navigating-the-boss-labyrinth/articleshow/123995367.cms,"Thirukkural

with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres.

Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece.

Kural 691

“Agalaadhu Anugaadhu Theekayvaar Polga:





Igal Vendhar Serndozhugu vaar”

Moving with the bosses is like sitting by the fireside;

Neither too close, nor too far.

In high-powered organizations, one lesson shines above all — protect the boss ’s ego. Disagree you may, but gently. Always accept the boss’s decision as final and weigh words like gold.We like to believe that careers are built on talent and hard work. But often, they are shaped by the temperament of the person we report to. Employees do not leave organisations; they leave their bosses. Bosses can wound in many ways—the one who makes your best efforts seem miniscule, the one who basks in the glow of victories but points an accusing finger at failures, the micro-manager who controls every move, and the monster manager who thrives on making others’ lives miserable.Even brilliant leaders are not exempt. Craig M Wright, an American scholar, studied the leadership styles of several geniuses such as Edison, Picasso, Henry Ford and Steve Jobs, who were masterminds and yet poor as leaders. Jobs, for instance, was allegedly obsessively controlling and prone to fits of rage. A few who worked under him have remarked that suffering soars as much as creativity under him.How then did employees survive their ire? By adapting. Some endured the storms in silence, some mastered the art of reading moods, and some simply left when the strain became too much. If this is the case with corporates—where checks and balances still exist—what about kings who held supreme power?History is filled with tales of such unchecked arrogance. Maharaja Jai Singh (1882–1937) despised defeat. Opponents in games were warned to lose, yet once during a polo match the opposite team triumphed. Furious, the Maharaja torched his horse, blaming it for the loss. On another occasion, he felt insulted at a Rolls-Royce showroom in London, and bought seven cars, shipped them to India, and used them as garbage carriers. King Farouk of Egypt (1920–1965) fared no better; he disliked the look of a railway station and ordered it to be demolished. Power, when absolute, often slid into cruelty.So how should one navigate a bully boss in the modern workplace? Experts say one should ever confront them mid-tirade. If the attack is by email, resist the urge to strike back instantly. Wait, and bring up the incident calmly in private. You may never get an apology, but your quiet reminder signals that respect cannot be trampled on. With narcissistic bosses, the path is different. Their charm is a mask that slips in time. When it does, the best course is to plan an exit, but carefully, without burning bridges.Centuries before, Thiruvalluvar anticipated these struggles in his chapter ‘Dealing with the Supremely Powerful’. His counsel is precise:·Do not compete with your boss·A bad impression is hard to erase. So try not to make any mistakes·Your boss may be friendly. Do not take liberties—never laugh out loud or whisper in his ear·Do not interrupt or question rashly·Intimacy does not mean privilegeAnd then comes his most profound metaphor, inThat, perhaps, is the timeless art. Whether in the court of kings or corporate corridors, survival rests, not in confrontation or servility, but in balance—knowing the exact distance at which one can sit, feel the warmth and not get burnt.","Bharathi Bhaskar explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’ Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124000930,imgsize-51472,width-1000,height-562,resizemode-75/124000930.jpg"

Possible Lineup Shifts

Why Bregman Makes Sense for the Phillies

Themay be one of the most complete teams in baseball, but that hasn’t stopped speculation about how they can take their roster to the next level. With big contracts already tied to stars like Bryce Harper, Trea Turner, Aaron Nola, Zack Wheeler, and Kyle Schwarber, the Phillies could still make a splash in free agency this offseason.One of the more intriguing ideas? Replacing longtime third baseman Alec Bohm with Boston Red Sox star Alex Bregman.Sports Illustrated’s Zach Pressnell floated the idea of the Philadelphia Phillies targeting Alex Bregman if they decide to upgrade at third base. The 31-year-old is expected to opt out of his three-year, $120 million deal in search of a bigger, longer contract - likely north of $40 million annually.Pressnell pointed out the inconsistency Bohm has brought to the lineup, saying, “Alec Bohm is a question mark in the lineup most of the time, which opens a hole for Bregman in the City of Brotherly Love.”Despite missing significant time in the middle of the season, Bregman has remained productive at the plate. He also brings championship experience, having won two World Series titles with the Houston Astros, including the 2022 triumph over Philadelphia when he hit .294 with a .948 OPS in the postseason.Signing Bregman would add even more financial weight to an already expensive roster. The Philadelphia Phillies will also need to decide whether to prioritize re-signing key players like Schwarber or JT Realmuto.If either leaves before Bregman makes his decision, however, he could be a strong pivot option.Bohm, who has been a regular with the Phillies since his debut, is under contract through the 2026 season. But Philadelphia already entertained the idea of moving him last offseason, which suggests his long-term future isn’t secure.While Bohm has improved his defense over the years, he still lacks power at the plate and doesn’t draw many walks. With free agency looming after the 2026 season, the Philadelphia Phillies could look to get ahead of the curve by bringing in a player like Alex Bregman.If the Phillies choose to keep Bohm while also pursuing Bregman, a reshuffling of positions could occur:• Bohm moves to first base• Bregman takes over at third• Bryce Harper shifts to right fieldThough unlikely, this scenario demonstrates the flexibility the Phillies could have if they pursue Bregman.• Significant offensive upgrade over Bohm• Reliable postseason performer• Proven defender at third base• Veteran experience with championship pedigreeThe Phillies, if unbothered by the financial implications, would clearly benefit from the upgrade. The move would also soften the blow of losing Bohm when his contract ends.Also read: MLB Trade Rumors: Philadelphia Phillies Eye $54 Million New York Mets All-Star as Potential Harper DH Shift Looms The Philadelphia Phillies’ priority this offseason remains bringing back Kyle Schwarber, but adding Alex Bregman would give them another proven star in the infield. For a team already chasing championships, the Red Sox slugger could represent the kind of bold move that keeps them ahead of the competition.","The Philadelphia Phillies have been linked to Boston Red Sox star Alex Bregman.

Dolphins coach believes Josh Allen fumbled before kneel down



NFL review looms after Dolphins fall to 0–3



The Buffalo Bills’ 31–21 win over the Miami Dolphins wasn’t without controversy. Just before halftime, a peculiar play involving Josh Allen caught the attention of Dolphins coach Mike McDaniel, who has since raised the issue with the NFL. The moment, while fleeting, left plenty of fans and analysts debating what really happened.With the game tied at 14 and only two seconds remaining in the first half, Allen and the Bills offense lined up to kneel the ball. But the snap didn’t go as planned. Allen appeared to mishandle the exchange, briefly losing control before dropping to a knee. The official immediately blew the whistle, and Allen jogged off the field after tossing the ball to a referee. Miami’s Jack Jones gave chase, thinking the play was still live.The official game record listed the sequence as an Allen fumble and recovery at Buffalo’s 28-yard line. That’s where the debate began.McDaniel admitted he saw it as a potential turnover. “So this was a great exercise in my mental discipline. I saw it. I knew what happened. And I also saw the whistle blow. And I saw them run in. And so then I ran in to prepare for the second half knowing that he just fumbled—or I thought they did at least,” he told reporters.According to the NFL rulebook, the ball is dead once a quarterback takes a knee or simulates the motion. That may explain why officials ended the play quickly. Yet McDaniel still wants clarity. “Live speed, it appeared that it was a fumble under the assumption that it was a clean center-quarterback exchange,” he added.Whether or not the call would have changed the game’s outcome is hard to say. With virtually no time left in the half, Miami’s chances of capitalizing were slim. Still, video of the moment sparked debate online, with fans questioning if Allen’s knee was truly down when he regained control.For McDaniel, the focus now is on moving forward. “I don’t think it’s appropriate for everyone to wait around while I have an adult temper tantrum,” he said.The Dolphins dropped to 0–3 after the loss, while the Bills remain unbeaten at 3–0. Miami faces the New York Jets next in a must-win clash.Also Read: Justin Herbert's Madison Beer stuns with new single “Yes Baby” as Chargers WAG loves her wet workout look","Dolphins coach believes Josh Allen fumbled before kneel down.

Cardi B pregnancy ties into Stefon Diggs family story

Stefon Diggs family tree is back in the spotlight after Cardi B revealed she is pregnant with the New England Patriots wide receiver’s child. The rapper confirmed the news during a Sept. 17 interview on CBS Mornings, making it her fourth child and her first with Diggs. The announcement linked one of the NFL’s most productive receivers with one of the biggest names in music, sparking fresh attention on Diggs’ personal life and family roots.Stefon Diggs was born on Nov. 29, 1993, in Gaithersburg, Md., to Aron and Stephanie Diggs. His father, Aron, was instrumental in pushing his sons into football. He coached their youth teams, enforced discipline, and gave Diggs the work ethic that carried him into the NFL. Before passing away from congestive heart failure in 2008 at age 39, Aron told his son to take care of the family. “He just told me, ‘Look after your brothers. Look after your mom. Look after your family,’” Stefon recalled.Stephanie Diggs kept the family together after Aron’s death. She worked three decades at Amtrak while picking up jobs at Target and Toys R Us. Diggs has called her “Superwoman” for raising five kids while working multiple shifts.Today, she travels frequently to watch Stefon play for the Patriots and his younger son Trevon Diggs play cornerback for the Dallas Cowboys.Trevon Diggs is the most well-known of Stefon’s siblings. The Cowboys cornerback was drafted in 2020 and quickly became one of the league’s best at his position. Since their father’s death, Stefon has acted as a mentor and father figure to Trevon. “If you do good things, he’s gonna follow you. If you do bad things, he’s gonna follow you,” Stephanie once told Stefon. That advice defined the way the older brother guided the younger one.The family tree also includes Mar’Sean “Darez” Diggs, who played defensive back at UAB from 2016 to 2018. He shares the same father as Stefon but grew closer to him after Aron’s death. Aron Diggs Jr. is Stefon’s older half-brother, while sister Porsche Green has been described by Stephanie as the glue who helped keep the family together.The most private part of Stefon Diggs family tree is his daughter, Nova. Born in 2016, Nova has appeared alongside her father at NFL games and events but has largely been kept away from public attention. Diggs, who helped raise his siblings after their father’s death, has often spoken about responsibility and the importance of family, values that extend into his role as a parent.Cardi B and Stefon Diggs have been linked since 2024, spotted together at high-profile events like the Met Gala and Coachella. In September 2025, Cardi ended speculation by confirming she is pregnant with Diggs’ child. “I’m having a baby with my boyfriend, Stefon Diggs,” she told Gayle King. The baby is due before her Little Miss Drama tour begins in February 2026.Cardi credited Diggs with providing stability in her life. “He just makes me feel safe and very confident and very strong,” she said. The relationship adds another public layer to Diggs’ family tree, already built on resilience and responsibility. For a player whose life changed after stepping into the role of father figure as a teenager, the connection with Cardi marks the start of a new chapter.Cardi B confirmed she’s expecting her first child with Stefon Diggs but admitted she wanted to keep the news quiet for as long as she could. Speaking with Gayle King on CBS Mornings while promoting her new album Am I The Drama?, she explained why she delayed telling the public, and even her parents. “I just was like, ‘Can I just say it on my own time?’ Like, I’m not hiding. On my time, on my own terms. Let me close some deals first, you know what I’m saying? Let me close some deals first. ” She added, “And it’s like, you don’t really want to say right away that you’re pregnant. It’s like, ‘Let me see a couple of more sonograms. Let my baby be healthy.’”Her parents only recently found out, something she joked about: “They just be looking at me. I’m very scared of my parents!” Still, they’ve welcomed Diggs, who signed with the Patriots in March. Now that the secret’s out, Cardi’s tying the news back to her music. “By the way, now that I talked about it, y’all better get my album,” she told viewers. “Y’all wanted to know, right? Now you know. Now y’all can buy my album, so I can buy Pampers and diapers and all that type of stuff. I told y’all, now go support my album ’cause I’m a mother of four now!” Cardi already shares three kids, Blossom, 12 months, Kulture, 7, and Wave, 4, with her ex-husband, Offset.Cardi B gave fans a glimpse into her relationship with Stefon Diggs on Wednesday, Sept. 17, sharing a cozy selfie on X. The photo was dimly lit but showed the rapper smiling into the camera with her arm wrapped around the NFL star, while Diggs looked off to the side. She kept the caption simple, posting just a ""❤️"" alongside the snap.That same day, Cardi revealed on CBS Mornings that she’s expecting her fourth child, her first with Diggs, before her tour kicks off in February. ""I'm having a baby with my boyfriend, Stefon Diggs,"" she told Gayle King. The rapper, already mom to Kulture, Wave, and Blossom with estranged husband Offset, spoke about how this pregnancy feels different. ""I'm excited. I'm happy. I feel like I'm in a good space. I feel very strong, very powerful that I'm doing all this work, but I'm doing all this work while I'm creating a baby. "" Diggs, meanwhile, is dad to his 8-year-old daughter, Nova.Cardi B is back with her long-awaited sophomore album, Am I the Drama?, released Friday, Sept. 19, more than seven years after Invasion of Privacy.The 23-track project includes hits like WAP, Up, Outside, and Imaginary Playerz, with features from Megan Thee Stallion, Lizzo, Selena Gomez, Kehlani, Janet Jackson, and more. Cardi has leaned into bold promotions too, turning courthouse photos into album covers and staging subway skits in New York City.","Stefon Diggs was born on Nov. 29, 1993, in Gaithersburg, Md., to Aron and Stephanie Diggs. His father, Aron, was instrumental in pushing his sons into football. Diggs siblings include Cowboys star Trevon Diggs, former UAB defensive back Mar’Sean Diggs, and siblings Aron Jr. and Porsche Green.

Just then, a police officer asked her to step back as she approached Sims. This led to an exchange of words; however, moments later, Cunningham chose to back down.

“Go ahead and paint your nails” — Cam Newton slams Caleb Williams for letting style distract from winning,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/go-ahead-and-paint-your-nails-cam-newton-slams-caleb-williams-for-letting-style-distract-from-winning/articleshow/124009585.cms,"Caleb Williams of the Chicago Bears warms up prior to the game against the Detroit Lions (Image Source - Getty Images)

Caleb Williams struggles in second NFL season with Chicago Bears

Cam Newton CALLS OUT Caleb Williams: ""Focus on WINNING, Not Nails""

Cam Newton urges Caleb Williams to focus on winning instead of media distractions

Another take from Cam Newton, the former NFL quarterback, was aimed at Chicago Bears quarterback Caleb Williams. He pointed out that Williams is letting off-field distractions, like the talk about his painted nails, get in the way of his game focus. This was shared on Newton's podcast, where he highlighted that performance should take precedence over personal flair, particularly given the Bears' rough start to the season.Caleb Williams is recognized for his distinctive personal style, which includes painting his nails as a way to express himself. In April 2024, just before joining the league, Williams received criticism for this practice, with some doubting its appropriateness for a quarterback.During that period, Cam Newton came to Williams' defense on the ""Club Shay Shay"" podcast, saying, ""I guarantee if he paint his nails pink, and he go out there and ball, ain't nobody gonna say nothing about the pink,"". However, by September 2025, with Williams in his second NFL season and the Bears starting 0-2, Newton's tone shifted.The Bears' 2025 season started off rough with losses to their divisional foes: they fell to the Minnesota Vikings in Week 1 after leading in the first half but not being able to finish strong in the second.Then, in Week 2, they got crushed by the Detroit Lions in a 52-something blowout, as their defense struggled to contain the scoring.Williams' personal stats for these games show a passer rating under 90, a completion percentage of 61.5%, a passing success rate of 39.4%, and he has taken six sacks. The team, which finished with a 5-12 record in 2024, is now led by new head coach Ben Johnson. He has openly criticized the team's practice performance, pointing out that while problems like missed assignments can be corrected, they need improved focus.This shaky start has heightened the conversations surrounding Williams, particularly his style choices, sparking talks about whether these factors divert attention from his performance on the field. The criticism peaked in the episode of Newton's podcast ""4th&1 with Cam Newton"" titled ""Caleb Williams keeps going VIRAL for all the WRONG REASONS!"", released on YouTube on September 19, 2025, featuring guests Adam ""Pacman"" Jones and Reshad Jones.Newton was telling Williams to focus on winning instead of chatting with the media about stuff that isn't football. Newton, who used to be the MVP and quarterback for the Carolina Panthers, started his podcast ""4th&1"" to keep players accountable, as he mentioned in the episode, ""The reason why I created fourth and one is to hold everybody accountable."".Newton specifically told Williams, via the podcast, ""If that's what it takes for him to go out there and win football games, go ahead and paint your nails, my boy."" However, he added, ""Well, he's not winning. I think that's the problem. Why? If he was going out there and dominating, who gives a sh*t what color he's painting his nails, right?"" This illustrates Newton's perspective that quarterbacks should have to justify their unique traits with their performance, similar to how Tom Brady can get away with it because of his regular wins.Guest Adam ""Pacman"" Jones echoed this, saying, ""Any quarterback with nails on suck. ... I don't want my quarterback with no nails on your personal time."" Newton also suggested to Williams that he should ""pass on"" media chances regarding his nails, mentioning, ""Keep the main thing the main thing. And the main thing for you as a quarterback in your situation is winning. ... All that is all distractions if you're not winning. "" He warned that without wins, optics suffer: ""You’ve got a quarterback that’s worried about getting the French tip more than getting the ball over the goal line. ... The optics don’t look good.""Newton mentioned certain games, sharing with Williams, ""You played in a winnable first half versus the Minnesota Vikings. And where was all the execution and focus in the second half? You lost that game. Hey, you just played a division foe in the Detroit Lions. They put up a 52 Ray Lewis on you."" The term ""52 Ray Lewis"" probably refers to the Lions putting up 52 points, referencing the iconic jersey number of the legendary defender Ray Lewis to highlight the defensive effort.Also Read: “You should not be that gifted” — Colin Cowherd praises Buffalo Bills QB Josh Allen’s unstoppable 2025 form As the Bears gear up for Week 3 against the Dallas Cowboys, who have racked up 60 points in their first two games, the pressure is on to steer clear of an 0-3 start—this would be the second time since 2023. Williams' nail art, done for Week 1 by the same artist who worked with WNBA star Angel Reese, keeps sparking viral conversations, but Newton's point stands: winning on the field is what really matters.","Caleb Williams is recognized for his distinctive personal style, which includes painting his nails as a way to express himself.

Oman turned a routine fixture into a thriller at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium on Friday, rattling India before the favourites scraped through with a narrow win. What was meant to be a warm-up for the Pakistan clash turned into a nail-biter, as skipper Suryakumar Yadav and head coach Gautam Gambhir watched nervously while their side survived Oman’s spirited charge.India eked out a narrow 21-run win over Oman. After opting to bat first, India posted 188 for 8 on a sluggish Abu Dhabi track. In reply, Oman managed 167 for 4.Ahead of the Pakistan match earlier in the tournament, batting coach Sitanshu Kotak insisted that flexibility would be the key to India’s middle order in the Asia Cup. He made it clear that beyond the opening pair of Shubman Gill and Abhishek Sharma, the rest of the batters would be used as floaters depending on the situation.On Friday, India turned their middle order on its head. Sanju Samson was sent in at No. 3, while captain Suryakumar Yadav kept sliding himself down. But the ploy spiralled into farce as Harshit Rana, Arshdeep Singh, and Kuldeep Yadav batted ahead of him — leaving the India captain stranded at No.11, the only player who didn’t have to come out with the blade.India rested Jasprit Bumrah and Varun Chakravarthy, while leading wicket-takers Arshdeep Singh and Harshit Rana got their chance.In India’s floating middle-order, only Sanju Samson and Axar Patel made the most of their opportunities against Oman.Samson walked in at No. 3 to the loudest cheer from the packed Abu Dhabi crowd. He brought up his slowest T20I fifty, off 41 balls, striking three sixes but never looking fully fluent.Axar Patel, in contrast, was in dismissive touch during his 13-ball 26. He welcomed Aamir Kaleem with a six, but the left-arm spinner had the last laugh. Trying to overhit, Axar lost his shape, got a faint under-edge, and was sharply caught by the keeper. Hardik Pandya fell in the unluckiest fashion — run out at the non-striker’s end. Samson’s mistimed drive popped up, and Jiten Ramanandi’s fingertip deflection rolled onto the stumps. Hardik stretched desperately to make his ground but was just short.Earlier, India had lost Shubman Gill (5) — undone by a classic left-arm delivery. Shah Faisal’s late swing went straight through the gates.Meanwhile, Abhishek Sharma continued his explosive form, smashing a 15-ball 38. The southpaw teed off with a four and a six before ending Shakeel’s over with another boundary.Tilak Varma (29) added the finishing touches with a couple of big sixes, and Harshit Rana, who had impressed in the nets the previous day, signed off India’s innings with a six.For Oman, Shah Faisal (2/23), Jiten Ramanandi (2/33), and Aamir Kaleem (2/32) claimed two wickets each.Oman bowed out of the tournament with three consecutive losses but showed real fight against India.India, the hot favourites, treated it like a warm-up — arriving late at the venue, making changes in the XI, and experimenting with the batting order. Captain Suryakumar even decided not to bat. But for Oman, it was a landmark occasion — playing India for the first time.Oman’s team bus arrived an hour and a half before India’s. They looked pumped during warm-ups. Captain Jatinder Singh embraced his counterpart Suryakumar Yadav at the toss and even presented him with a gift.Oman’s left-arm quick Shah Faisal bowled a dream delivery to castle Shubman Gill and finished with a wicket-maiden — becoming the first bowler from an Associate side to bowl a maiden inside the first six overs against India.With the bat, Oman were equally impressive.Openers Jatinder Singh (32) and Aamir Kaleem (64) put on a gutsy 50-run stand. They became the first opening pair in 14 matches to keep India wicketless in the powerplay. The last time India didn’t pick up a wicket in the powerplay was against Sri Lanka in July 2024. It was also the first time Oman’s openers went wicketless against a full-member side in the powerplay.Veteran Aamir Kaleem, battling cramps, struck a feisty half-century. His knock ended when Hardik Pandya took a stunning running catch, breaking the 93-run second-wicket stand. He scored 64 off 46 balls, with seven boundaries and two sixes.Hammad Mirza also completed a fighting half-century. His back-to-back sixes off Kuldeep Yadav were a delight, and he scored 51 before his dismissal ended Oman’s spirited chase.","India eked out a narrow 21-run win over Oman.

Brief Scores:

MUMBAI: Showing signs of recovering his touch in red-ball cricket after stepping down from Mumbai captaincy on August 21, veteran batter and former India captain Ajinkya Rahane slammed a fine century (103 retired out, 140 balls, 12x4, 2x6) to help Mumbai earn a hard-fought draw against KSCA Secretary's XI in their last league match of the KSCA K Thimmappiah Memorial Cricket Tournament at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru on Thursday. Rahane 's free-flowing hundred and useful contribution from Pranav Kela (46, 116b, 1x4), Musheer Khan (43, 43b, 4x4, 1x6), Suved Parkar (36, 49b, 6x4) and Hardik Tamore (34 not out, 30b, 3x4, 2x6) helped Mumbai end the four-day match at 270 for five in 66.5 overs.Rahane had scored 26 off 46 balls, with four fours in Mumbai's first innings. The 37-year-old, who had opted to play in this tournament to regain form, had scored 66 (110b, 7x4) in the first match against Assam.However, while Rahane getting back into runs is an encouraging sign, Mumbai's pre-season build-up to the 2025-26 edition of the Ranji Trophy hasn't been ideal in terms of results, as they crashed out of the KSCA tournament in the league stage after conceding the first innings lead against hosts KSCA Secretary's XI. Earlier, Mumbai had failed to make the knockouts of the Buchi Babu Trophy — the other pre-season tournament, too.Clearly, the domestic heavyweights must pull up their socks before they face Jammu & Kashmir in Srinagar in their opening Ranji Trophy match of the season from October 15.Replying to KSCA Secretary's XI's 280, Mumbai folded up for 182 in 48.2 overs, with only skipper and India's Test allrounder Shardul Thakur , batting at No. 8, offering some resistance with a fighting 77 (96 balls, 7x4, 4x6), while Musheer made 18 (41 balls, 1x4). Left-arm spinner Madhav Bajaj took five for 61 in 18 overs for KSCA Secretary's XI.In the second innings, KSCA Secretary's XI finished at 429, with No. 5 batter Druv P scoring an unbeaten 159 (352 balls, 17x4, 3x6). Apart from Rahane and Thakur's batting, the other bright spots for Mumbai were the eight-wicket haul by 26-year-old pacer Sylvester D'Souza (3-51 & 5-65) and a fine show by fast bowler Tushar Deshpande (3 for 40) in the first innings. With the ball, Thakur took just two wickets in the match — one for 32 in 12 overs in the first innings and one for 20 in nine overs in the second.KSCA Secretary's XI 280 (Abhishek Ahlawat 52, Lochan Gowda 48, Dheeraj Gowda 45, Nikin Jose 37; Tushar Deshpande 3-40, Sylvester Dsouza 3-51) & 429 (Druv P 159 not out, Kruthik Krishna 77, Rajvir Wadhwa 57, Faizan Khan 53; Sylvester D’Souza 5-65) drew with Mumbai 182 (Shardul Thakur 77, Ajinkya Rahane 26; Madhav Bajaj 5-61) & 270-5 (Ajinkya Rahane retd out 103, Pranav Kela 46, Musheer Khan 43, Suved Parkar 36, Hardik Tamore 34 not out).","Ajinkya Rahane scores 103 to help Mumbai earn draw against KSCA Secretary's XI.

Poll After watching Kaleem's performance, should age be a barrier in sports? Yes, it should be No, it's just a number Depends on the sport

NEW DELHI: At 43, Aamir Kaleem isn’t the typical T20 opener, but on Friday night in Abu Dhabi, he turned back the clock to script a spirited stand against world champions India in the Asia Cup . Battling heat, humidity and cramps, Kaleem struck a gritty 64 off 46 balls to give Oman genuine hope of pulling off the tournament’s biggest upset.Kaleem’s story is remarkable. Having emigrated from Pakistan, he has been part of Oman cricket since 2012, but his role has changed often. Starting as a No. 11 left-arm spinner, he gradually pushed into the middle order, chipping in with handy runs but largely relied upon for his bowling. A spell out of the side in early 2022 hinted his international days were over, but a comeback in late 2024 saw him reinvented as an opener — a role that has since become his own.He celebrated his maiden T20I fifty with an unbeaten 72 against USA earlier this year. Against India, the stage was grander and the challenge far tougher, yet Kaleem embraced it. Partnering Hammad Mirza (51), he added 93 runs for the second wicket to put Oman within striking distance of India’s 188. For a moment, the Asia Cup holders looked rattled as Oman’s chase gathered steam.The dream ended when Hardik Pandya pulled off a stunning catch at the boundary to dismiss Kaleem off Harshit Rana, before removing Mirza in the next over.India eventually sealed a 21-run win, with Arshdeep Singh claiming his 100th T20I wicket.Earlier, Sanju Samson’s 56 and Abhishek Sharma’s explosive 38 had lifted India to a strong total, but Kaleem and Mirza made sure Oman didn’t go down without a fight. Kaleem also chipped in with the ball, returning figures of 2 for 31 to cap a fine all-round display.Oman skipper Jatinder Singh summed up the spirit best: “I am extremely proud of the unit. The way they came up, they had their plans and executed them well… So proud of the way they have shown their character in the crunch situation.”For Oman, Kaleem’s knock was more than runs — it was a reminder that even at 43, experience and fight can rattle giants.","Oman's Aamir Kaleem scored a gritty 64 off 46 balls against India.

NEW DELHI: India all-rounder Axar Patel is reported to be “doing fine” after suffering a blow to the head while fielding in Friday’s Asia Cup Group A clash against Oman, India’s fielding coach T Dilip confirmed after the match.The incident occurred in the 15th over when Axar, stationed at mid-off, ran to his left to stop a miscued shot from Hammad Mirza.

India vs Oman in Asia Cup: Rinku takes STUNNING low catch; SKY sets stage on fire at nets

Poll Do you agree with Suryakumar Yadav's decision to not bat against Oman? Yes, it was a strategic move No, he should have batted Unsure about his reasoning

NEW DELHI: Cricket legend Sunil Gavaskar defended India captain Suryakumar Yadav ’s controversial decision to not bat in the Asia Cup 2025 Group A clash against Oman, even after India lost eight wickets. The move sparked debate after India beat Oman by 21 runs at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi on Friday. Batting first, India posted 188/8, while Oman responded with a spirited 167/4.During a discussion on Sony Sports, Gavaskar explained his backing: “If he had batted for even one over, he could have hit a few fours and sixes and that would have been good for him. But the way he batted against Pakistan, maybe does not need batting practice. He may have thought that Kuldeep Yadav 's batting could come in handy if India lose quick wickets in one of the matches. Perhaps that's why he may have sent Kuldeep in to bat.”The 76-year-old former India captain added: “He is very unorthodox thinker. We saw in Sri Lanka that he himself bowled and also gave Rinku Singh the ball. He turned the game, which seemed to have slipped away, on its head and won India the match. He is an innovative thinker. Maybe that's why he did not bat and sent in Kuldeep and Arshdeep Singh.”While Sunil Gavaskar praised Surya’s tactical approach, his son and former India cricketer Rohan Gavaskar questioned the logic. He felt India missed an opportunity to rest Suryakumar while giving Rinku Singh a chance.“What doesn’t register with me is, if Suryakumar Yadav isn’t going to bat clearly because he’s sent Arshdeep, Harshit, and Kuldeep all ahead of him, then he might as well take a rest. Give Rinku a go. You’re not going to bat; you’re not going to contribute with the ball. If that’s the whole thought process, then let Rinku have a game,” Rohan told Cricbuzz.The debate around Surya’s unorthodox decision continues, but cricket experts like Sunil Gavaskar believe it reflects his innovative thinking and long-term strategy, signaling a captain willing to take bold risks for the bigger picture.",Sunil Gavaskar defends India captain Suryakumar Yadav's decision to not bat in the Asia Cup 2025 Group A clash against Oman.

Aquilini family feud shakes Vancouver Canucks



Matteo Aquilini challenges trust restructuring



Impact of Aquilini lawsuit on NHL season



The Vancouver Canucks are heading into the 2025–26 NHL season, but a family legal dispute is drawing attention away from hockey. Matteo Aquilini, grandson of Luigi and Elisa Aquilini, has filed a lawsuit. He claimed he was disinherited from the family trust and excluded from the family business. The case names key figures, including Canucks chairman Francesco Aquilini and uncle Roberto Aquilini.Matteo Aquilini, the son of former co-owner Paolo Aquilini, alleges that his grandfather, Luigi, and uncles, Roberto and Francesco, acted to remove his family from control and inheritance. The lawsuit claims this was in retaliation after Paolo raised historical sexual assault allegations against another family member.The dispute centers on the Luigi and Elisa Aquilini Legacy Trust. Matteo states that it was reorganized in 2015, while Elisa Aquilini was seriously ill, allowing Luigi, Francesco, and Roberto to appoint themselves as beneficiaries. Matteo argues this reorganization violated the terms of a 1995 trust that had aimed to prevent Luigi from controlling the family assets.According to the legal filing, the family’s wealth and business interests, including the Canucks and Rogers Arena, are valued in the billions.Matteo seeks restoration of his family’s share of the trust and legal damages for breach of trust, breach of fiduciary duty, conspiracy, and unjust enrichment.The lawsuit details how the 2015 restructuring concentrated power with Luigi, Francesco, and Roberto. Matteo claims they acted deliberately to push Paolo’s family out of the business after the sexual assault allegations came to light in 2020. The filing says the defendants conspired to disinherit Paolo’s lineage entirely from the family’s holdings.The dispute also includes workplace concerns. Matteo’s brother, Christian Aquilini, who has autism, filed a complaint with the B.C. Human Rights Tribunal after alleging harassment and discrimination while working for the Vancouver Canucks Limited Partnership. Christian reportedly stopped working due to emotional distress linked to threats from his uncles.The lawsuit arrives at a sensitive time for the Vancouver Canucks. Training camp is underway, and the 2025–26 season is about to begin. But uncertainty about who owns the team and public family fights could hurt the team's focus and morale.As chairman and governor, Francesco Aquilini is still a key player in the group. The lawsuit has already gotten a lot of media attention, even though the court case is still going on. And may continue to cast a shadow over the team’s operations and public image.Also Read: NHL star Connor McDavid’s wife, Lauren Kyle, opens her cottage retreat","Matteo Aquilini claims he was disinherited from the family trust and excluded from family business.

Mac Jones expected to start for 49ers in Brock Purdy’s absence



Injury report and team updates ahead of Week 3



San Francisco 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy is “highly unlikely” to start on Sunday against the Arizona Cardinals due to a lingering toe injury. Purdy, who has already missed one game this season, was officially listed as questionable, with a final decision expected Saturday. Coach Kyle Shanahan hinted that Purdy might serve as a backup or emergency quarterback if he cannot play. “A lot of progress and thought he had a good week,” Shanahan said. “We’ll see how he does tomorrow. It’s highly unlikely that he will start.”If Purdy cannot take the field, Mac Jones will make his second straight start for San Francisco. Jones impressed in his first outing against the New Orleans Saints, throwing for 279 yards and three touchdowns. His performance helped the 49ers secure a 26-21 victory without missing a beat. CBS Sports Research noted Jones became the first quarterback in franchise history to throw for 275 yards, three touchdowns, and zero interceptions in his debut start.Should Purdy remain inactive or be listed as the emergency third quarterback, the 49ers would need to elevate Adrian Martinez from the practice squad to fill the roster spot.Purdy initially injured the toe in the season opener against Seattle but managed to play through the pain, completing 26 of 35 passes for 277 yards, two touchdowns, and two interceptions, including a game-winning 4-yard touchdown pass to Jake Tonges.The 49ers face multiple injury concerns heading into the game. Receiver Jauan Jennings, dealing with ankle and shoulder issues, missed his third consecutive practice and remains questionable. Offensive lineman Connor Colby, sidelined with a groin injury, is also listed as questionable. Backup tackle Spencer Burford (knee) and rookie receiver Jordan Watkins (calf) will not play, with Watkins expected to miss three to four weeks.There was some positive news, as fullback Kyle Juszczyk and defensive back Siran Neal cleared concussion protocols and are available. Despite these setbacks, San Francisco’s offense has shown resilience.

Eagles’ offensive rhythm remains inconsistent despite red-zone efficiency

Tush Push fuels debate and demands tighter officiating

Philadelphia Eagles veteran Jason Kelce didn’t hold back when discussing his former team who defeated the Kansas City Chiefs by 29°0-17. Speaking on the Sportsradio 94 WIP podcast, Kelce highlighted several areas of concern, pointing out offensive breakdowns, missed assignments, and the challenges of the “Tush Push” quarterback sneak in critical situations.Jason Kelce noted that the passing attack looked disjointed at times, with players missing assignments that stalled momentum. “If they don’t miss the corner blitzing on the nub side, they get that picked up. That might be a huge play down the field,” he explained. Despite these challenges, Kelce remains optimistic, citing improved performance in the run game with Saquon Barkley and confidence in the passing game.Statistically, the Eagles rank 29th in passing yards per game but have thrived in the red zone, converting all five trips inside the 20-yard line into touchdowns. “I think that they’ve been great in certain situations…good in third-down conversions, which part of that is Tush Push related,” Kelce said. The team’s short-yardage strategy, led by the Tush Push, continues to be a reliable weapon.The Tush Push, a quarterback sneak powered by linemen pushing behind Jalen Hurts, remains one of the most debated plays in the NFL.While nearly banned at the NFL owners’ meetings, it survived by just two votes. Officials have struggled to enforce the play consistently, and the league recently distributed training tapes to referees to tighten enforcement. NFL VP of officiating Ramon George said, “This is a very hard play to officiate. I get it.”Eagles fans and analysts remain split: some view the play as a strategic masterstroke, while others see it as a crutch. Kelce emphasized that while the tactic is effective, the team must carefully integrate it within the broader offensive game plan.Also Read: Controversial Josh Allen kneeldown sparks Dolphins–NFL discussions, Mike McDaniel believes ball was fumbled The Eagles’ early-season record reflects a team still adjusting, with potential in key situations but room for improvement as they seek consistency under pressure.","Philadelphia Eagles veteran Jason Kelce spoke on the Sportsradio 94 WIP podcast.

Tyler Herro sends a strong message amid injury recovery



Miami Heat facing early challenges and looming contract talks



Tyler Herro will not be on the court when the Miami Heat tip off their 2025-26 campaign. The guard underwent surgery on his left foot and ankle to repair posterior impingement syndrome, an injury that had plagued him since the offseason. The procedure, performed last Friday, is expected to sideline him for about eight weeks, pushing his return into mid-November and forcing Miami to start the season without its leading scorer.25-year-old guard Tyler Herro initially attempted to avoid surgery through platelet-rich plasma and cortisone injections, but the pain persisted, according to Herald. Doctors ultimately recommended surgery, which was deemed successful. The projected timetable means Herro could miss the team’s first 14 games.Herro didn’t stay quiet after the procedure. From the hospital bed, he took to Instagram to share his mindset during recovery: “Imma tear the league back down once I get off this weak off bed.” The post, which included a photo of Herro flashing a middle finger, sent a strong message about his determination to return.His absence is a significant blow for Miami. Last season, Herro delivered a career year, averaging 23.9 points, 5.5 assists, and 5.2 rebounds in 77 games while shooting 47.2 percent from the field and 37.5 percent from deep.He earned his first All-Star selection, won the Three-Point Contest, and quickly established himself as the Heat’s primary scoring option. The team scored 8.6 fewer points per 100 possessions when he was not on the floor.With Herro sidelined, Miami will look to offseason acquisition Norman Powell and second-year guard Pelle Larsson to absorb more playmaking responsibilities. Bam Adebayo’s versatility will be critical, but the Heat will be hard-pressed to replace Herro’s offensive creation during the opening stretch of the season.Beyond basketball, the injury arrives at a delicate moment in Herro’s career. He becomes eligible on October 1 for an extension that could add three years and $149.7 million to his existing deal. If no agreement is reached by October 20, he would be in line for a four-year, $206.9 million extension next summer.Also Read: Stephen Curry shares candid remarks about his off-court duties as parent alongside wife Ayesha Curry","Tyler Herro underwent surgery on his left foot and ankle to repair posterior impingement syndrome.

Stephen Curry has built an astonishing legacy on the NBA hardwood. However, away from the spotlight, his most demanding role happens at home. The Golden State Warriors star is the father of four children with his wife, Ayesha Curry , and he admits that life beyond basketball is filled with unpredictability, laughter, and plenty of lessons for the 37-year-old. In a recent interview, Curry shared details of parenting with his wife.The four-time NBA champion Stephen Curry says raising children at completely different life stages has shaped him as a parent. His oldest daughter, Riley, is now 13, Ryan, 10, and Canon, 7, while his youngest, Caius, is just 15 months.“Every day is a wild experience, and I’m enjoying every little bit of it,” Curry told PEOPLE. “Fans would see there’s no such thing as balance, but you try every day to figure it out.”The spread of ages, Curry explains, forces him and Ayesha to adapt constantly. “Your ability to communicate and build trust with each one individually — like, you set up rules for the house, but each one has to be parented a little differently. That’s the cool part of the experience as a parent, and I’m loving every single minute of it.”Beyond the challenges, he says the true reward is watching his children grow into unique personalities.“They all teach me something every day… they’re hilarious — they ask questions that make you think. They all came from the same place, but they have such different personalities.”Curry also points out that consistency is central to how he and Ayesha raise their family. One rule they enforce is a strict no-games policy on school nights. It’s a tradition he borrowed directly from his parents, Sonya and Dell Curry.“That’s the one part of the parent playbook that we kept — just cut, copy, and paste,” Curry said. “On school nights you gotta make sure you’re getting your rest so you can get to school, have a good time, and learn.”Still, when game days roll around, rules soften. “They’re spoiled when they come to games,” he joked. “They try to get every snack, candy, treat — whatever you wanna call it. There’s really no limit at games ’cause I want ’em to have fun.”Also Read: ""Mind your fkn business""- Stephen Curry's heartwarming defense of Ayesha Curry gets instant support as Killer Mike faces wrath from fans online Curry and Ayesha have been one of the NBA’s power couples, and they are certainly the proud parents.","NBA star Stephen Curry is the father of four children with his wife, Ayesha.

Jonathan Kuminga rejects $75M offer as contract talks hit major roadblock

Jonathan Kuminga has repetitively made headlines for the Golden State Warriors this summer as they look forward to win their fifth championship since 2015. Although the offseason has mostly focused on Kuminga and his contract impasse, his agent just provided a significant update that may lead to him signing a contract shortly. Aaron Turner, Kuminga's agent, recently sent a direct warning amid a rumored $75.2 million contract impasse.As the October 1 qualifying offer deadline draws closer, Turner reportedly sent a warning to the Warriors' front management, according to Joseph Azizi of The Warriors Talk. Kuminga 's agent, shared his thoughts on the player's feelings throughout the negotiations on The Hoop Collective podcast.Additionally, he stated that although Kuminga would prefer to accept the player option, he would also accept the qualifying offer. If the Warriors want Kuminga to re-sign with them, they must treat him ""fairly,"" according to the agency. Turner then said:""There’s a lot of upside.. He wants to pick where he wants to go. So the QO is real for sure.. for sure there's no it's being considered completely. It's being talked about…”He continued:“We've gotten a disability policy out for him that would, you know, hedge out some of the injury risk. Um, but it's not something, you know, anybody wants to do. Neither side. I mean, Brian, you know this, right? Clearly that we wouldn't be here on September 18th on this podcast discussing this if either side wanted that to be the outcome…”He then added:“This is really a one-off situation. I can't remember where you're in the middle of the negotiation. and you're willing to bring the fans in um to hear this because I'm telling you there's incredible amount of interest in Jonathan's free agency more than I can remember..”Further talking about it, he said:“And probably because he's on the Warriors and partially because it's September and he's the number one free agent on the market and there's this and the Warriors have signed nobody officially at this point…”Since July, negotiations between Kuminga's team and the Warriors have stalled.According to reports, he first rejected Golden State's $45 million offer in search of a better offer. If the Warriors were to re-sign him on the $7.9 million qualifying offer, he would reportedly be tied under a no-trade clause for the 2025–2026 season and become an unrestricted free agent.However, he reportedly turned down the Warriors' upgraded offer of a three-year, $75.2 million contract once more because the third year had a team option rather than a player option. According to reports, Kuminga would rather accept the qualifying offer than the most recent two-year, $45 million offer from the Warriors.Furthermore, Kuminga is reportedly taking control of his future top priority. Reportedly, he is even willing to accept Golden State's initial $45 million contract if it includes a player option for the second year, which would give him more freedom with the team going forward.However, Kuminga will have to accept the one-year, $7.9 million qualifying offer if no deal is negotiated by October 1. Nevertheless, recently, Turner has reportedly cautioned the franchise that such a move might cause a great deal of tension in their partnership.Also read: NBA trade rumor – Jonathan Kuminga rejects Golden State Warriors’ $45 million offer, holds out for better deal before 2025–26 season","Jonathan Kuminga's agent, Aaron Turner, recently sent a direct warning amid a rumored $75.2 million contract impasse.

Michael Beasley had a bone to pick with Miami Heat’s coach Erik Spoelstra

Michael Beasley gradually understood Erik Spoelstra’s ideologies

Being a Miami Heat player is a big deal, as it comes with dire consequences. Apart from all of these, being with coach Erik Spoelstra is not for the weak, and Michael Beasley made it very clear. The franchise has had some exceptional players, including Beasley, largely due to their extremely talented coach, Erik Spoelstra. However, the ex-Heat star claimed that he still held some grudge against their head coach, Spoelstra. Most importantly, if one is not ready to give their hundred percent, they can’t be on the team either, and Erik Spoelstra is the epitome of dedication, discipline, and hard work. Here’s why the former Heat star used to have beef with Erik Spoelstra:There is no doubt that Erik Spoelstra has been a great coach of the Heat. However, some players might still have a bone to pick with him, including former Heat star Michael Beasley. “Everything that happened to you, good and bad, you are the common denominator”, Beasley said on “All the Smoke”. “Whether it was your fault or not, you gotta understand what you did wrong and what you could have done better.”Michael Beasley claimed that during his early years with the franchise, he used to blame coach Erik Spoelstra for all his struggles.However, when asked about his true feelings for Spoelstra, he made sure to keep himself out of controversy and gave a diplomatic answer.Had this been a decade ago, Michael Beasley would be in his “beefing” era. But as time went on, he gradually understood the true nature of Coach Erik Spoelstra. “I don’t blame no coaches. But I used to blame Spo a lot”, Michael Beasley said. “The older I got, the more I realized. My rookie year was his rookie year. Just as scared as I was of Riles, he was probably more (scared)”“From a 19-year-old’s perspective, you gotta think… It could have been SpongeBob in that coach spot, and I respected it because it was the head coach. I was more scared of Spo than he wants to believe. I didn’t know how to display my frustration in any other way but anger. Because it would just blow up, right? I was 19”, Beasley explained further. Well, faceoffs with Spoelstra are just as tough as playing against Beasley, but Beasley facing Spoelstra is quite a challenge, and both understood it well.Also read: Golden State Warriors trio want Jonathan Kuminga to stay with the team for upcoming season","Former Miami Heat star Michael Beasley had a bone to pick with Erik Spoelstra.

Wendell Smallwood’s fall from NFL glory to $645K COVID-19 fraud sentence

Former Eagles running back charged with fraud tied to COVID-19 relief programs

Wendell Smallwood expresses regret: ""I have nobody to blame but myself""



Former Philadelphia Eagles running back Wendell Smallwood Jr., once a promising NFL talent, now faces a harsh reality. On September 18, Judge Richard G. Andrews sentenced Smallwood to 18 months in federal prison for orchestrating multiple pandemic-era fraud schemes worth over $600,000. The fall from NFL glory to criminal conviction has stunned fans and marked a dramatic turn in the life of the Wilmington, Delaware native.Smallwood’s football journey began in Wilmington, Delaware, with dreams of making it to the NFL. Drafted 153rd overall by the Eagles in 2016, he achieved a career highlight as part of the 2017 squad that secured Philadelphia’s first-ever Super Bowl title. However, his NFL career faced setbacks, with the Eagles cutting him from the final 53-player roster in 2019. Brief stints with the Washington Redskins (2019) and Pittsburgh Steelers (2020) failed to reignite his professional career, leaving Smallwood at a crossroads.After leaving football, Smallwood turned to criminal activity. Federal prosecutors revealed that from 2020 to 2023, he orchestrated three separate schemes defrauding the U.S. government. Using fake Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) and Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) applications, along with fraudulent IRS tax filings, Smallwood siphoned or directed $645,000 for personal gain.Investigators revealed that Smallwood’s scheme involved a network of accomplices, using shell companies and kickbacks to execute the fraud. A 2023 raid at his New Jersey home uncovered assault-style firearms and high-capacity magazines, adding a separate layer of legal trouble he must still address.At his hearing, Smallwood expressed remorse. “I feel like I let the community down.
