How Rohit Sharma's inconsistency with the bat hurt India against New Zealand,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/new-zealand-in-india/how-rohit-sharmas-inconsistency-with-the-bat-hurt-india-against-new-zealand/articleshow/114899546.cms,"Rohit Sharma after his dismissal in Pune on October 24, 2024.

NEW DELHI: Leading from the front is what a captain is known for. And there is no doubt that Rohit Sharma has led India from the front ever since he was handed over the captaincy of the team.Rohit was absolutely fantastic with the bat in the ODI World Cup last year and India were looking good to go all the way before stumbling against the mighty Aussies in the final.Nevertheless, Rohit led India to glory in June by lifting the T20 World Cup title in the West Indies.But public memory is short. Some failures in the Test series against Bangladesh and New Zealand and the knives are out again and there were calls for change.Rohit last hit a Test hundred against England at Dharamsala in March 2024. That was India's last home Test series before the Bangladesh team arrived in September.In the four innings against Bangladesh, Rohit reached double figures only once when he scored 23 in the first innings of the second Test in Kanpur.Against New Zealand, Rohit scored 52 in the first Test of the second innings at Benglauru but the first innings debacle of India getting bundled out for 46 - their lowest ever Test total at home - meant that India were always on the back foot in the match.And it's not just the cheap dismissals but also the manner of his dismissals that's hurting India. He was clean bowled in both the innings at Benglauru and also in the first innings of the second Test at Pune.Rohit's clean bowled dismissals against Tim Southee are signs of worry. The dismissal in Pune was the 14th instance of Southee dismissing Rohit in all international cricket - the most he has dismissed a batter and the joint most Rohit has fallen to a bowler, alongside Kagiso Rabada Rohit has often been vulnerable to early swing and seam movement. Fast bowlers who can shape the ball away or bowl at a tight line have managed to exploit this, getting him out early in several innings.As India's captain and a senior batsman, there's always pressure to perform and lead by example. This can sometimes make it challenging to play with a free-flowing style, especially in high-stakes tournaments.Rohit had one more chance to come good with the bat at his home ground in Mumbai on Day 3. But with India chasing 147-run target, Rohit fell to Matt Henry after scoring 11 runs.Even though India have lost the series, a victory in the third Test would save Rohit and his team the ignominy of suffering a clean sweep at home.The Bangladesh and New Zealand series have not been an ideal preparation for India's upcoming tour of Australia. The knives will be out Down Under too.",Rohit Sharma last hit a Test hundred against England at Dharamsala in March 2024.

India Vs New Zealand 3rd Test: Tried to replicate what I did right against England: Shubman Gill,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/new-zealand-in-india/tried-to-replicate-what-i-did-right-against-england-shubman-gill/articleshow/114898853.cms,"Shubman Gill plays a shot during the second day of the third Test. (PTI Photo)

returns to earlier 'mindset against spin' to take the fight to the Kiwis

MUMBAI: For Shubman Gill, the end of 2024 is a complete contrast to how it began. Earlier this year, he was still settling into his new batting position at No. 3. Runs were difficult to come by and his spot in the Test squad was being questioned.Eyebrows were raised because he had last scored a century against Australia in March 2023 in Ahmedabad. Since then, for almost a year, he didn't cross a half-century in 12 innings, 10 of these innings as a No. 3 batter.But then came the turnaround with a century in the second Test against England in Vizag. Gill ended up scoring 500-plus runs in that series and since then, his bat has done the talking. In 12 innings after that knock, he has got two tons, two 90s — including one on Saturday — and a fifty.Gill's 146-ball 90 and his 96-run stand for the fifth wicket with Rishabh Pant helped India take a slender 27-run first-innings lead which at one point looked like a distant dream, given the way India had crumbled towards the end of the first day's play. While Pant was going hammer and tongs at one end, Gill looked rock solid at the other.He put away the loose balls, rotated the strike and made sure that New Zealand spinners couldn't hit the length they wanted. The only blip in his innings came when as he was nearing his half-century, when he was dropped byMark Chapman .The 25-year-old termed Saturday's knock as one of the better ones in his career, before adding that he dipped into what he had done right in the Test series against England and tried to replicate it.""It's definitely one of the better knocks I've played in Tests. In this match, it was about working on the areas I had worked on before the England series began. When I was batting in that series, I was batting at my best against spinners. And just to be able to go back into that mindset and what my positions were when I was playing spinners, that's what I was trying to replicate before this match,"" said Gill.""I was trying to just go out there and have another opportunity to bat for the maximum (time) I could and not put pressure on myself by thinking about how many runs I must score. You don't get to play that many Tests and I feel that when I'm batting there and putting pressure on myself, then I'm losing out on the fun of the art of batting,"" said Gill.",Gill's 146-ball 90 and his 96-run stand for the fifth wicket with Rishabh Pant helped India take a slender 27-run first-innings lead.

Travis Kelce was outspoken about the NFL penalties

Travis and Jason explain exactly what went wrong on ""Play of the Year"" Hail Mary

Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce was outspoken about the rules the NFL referees are setting for the 2024 season, from a strict crackdown on gun-related celebrations to significant fines. Defensive lineman Malcolm Roach of the Denver Broncos was fined $14,069 by the league for making a ""violent gesture"" during a celebration that the league felt was a display of a weapon. Regardless of whether Roach was dancing in a ritualistic gesture that was supposed to mimic some sort of arsenal or not, Kelce thinks the NFL should stop handing out penalties for the celebratory moves of its players.Also Read: Taylor Swift longtime nemesis has been reportedly anticipating the singer's breakup with Kansas City Chiefs' Travis Kelce The NFL has penalized wide receiver Andrei Iosivas $5,305 for firing imaginary bows during the 26-25 loss that the Cincinnati Bengals suffered against the Chiefs. The league classified this action as 'unsportsmanlike conduct/violent gesture', and Tom Pelissero had earlier reported on the matter as per the NFL Network. The NFL has also punished other athletes in the past for violent celebrations. Such a case was when the Atlanta Falcons wide receiver, Drake London, was fined $14,069. London, who mimicked a fire gun after assisting Atalanta defeat the Philadelphia Eagles, apologized for his action, saying he was carried away after winning.In a New Heights podcast episode, the Kelce brothers discussed the New York Jets wide receiver who received a penalty for a similar celebration. Jason Kelce pointed out the flag and called the NFL the ""No Fun League,"" while Travis's reaction was more emphatic. ""I know we don't want this to be like, 'Oh, NFL players shooting guns,'"" Travis said. ""I get that. But this is very subtle. Unless you do it against a defensive player, it shouldn't be a penalty.”""If you want to fine the guy after the game for doing it, whatever, that's up to the NFL for wanting to protect their league,"" Kelce added. ""I just think it's too much. It's too much and it's affecting the game in the wrong way. I understand that the guy has to play by the rules and stuff. I don't want the NFL to punish me for saying something, but I think this is going too far.” Travis jokingly argued that the NFL's prohibition of weapons-related celebrations goes against their rights. ""It's my Second Amendment,"" he joked. ""I have the right to bear arms.”Also Read: New York Jets wide receiver Garrett Wilson makes an incredible catch against Houston Texans","Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce was outspoken about the rules the NFL referees are setting for the 2024 season.

kiya Gautam Ko Left Right Combination 4th Innings Main Karna Chahiye ? | Basit Ali

NEW DELHI: With India set to chase a tricky total in the fourth innings on a deteriorating Wankhede pitch on Sunday, former Pakistan cricketer Basit Ali has advised head coach to go in with the left-right combination which will unsettle the New Zealand bowlers.At the close of play on the second day, the Kiwis took a 143-run lead and still had a wicket remaining.As India will look to grab the final wicket as quickly as possible on the third morning, they will be chasing a target of around 150 odd runs.Basit feels that the chase is not going to be easy on the Wankhede rank-turner and the left-right combination will be helpful for India.""The lead at the moment is 143. Can New Zealand set a target above 150? Let's see. But the chase is not going to be easy for India. In the last two Tests, Gautam went with left-right combination. But now is the time to do that. There are Jaiswal and Rohit at the top. It is not compulsory to send Gill has to come in at three and Kohli at 4. Now I will see whether Gambhir goes with the left-right combination in the chase or not,"" Basit said on his YouTube channel.After a late collapse late on the second day, Shubman Gill and Rishabh Pant played exceptionally well in the morning session to arrest India's slide.The duo added 96 runs for the fifth wicket, scoring 90 and 60 respectively.Washington Sundar then added quick 38 runs lower down the order as India took a slim 28-run lead.Basit lauded the India youngsters for their courageous innings on a testing surface, saying that the pitch has been toughest to bat on in the entire series.""Gill, Pant and Sundar batted really well in the first innings. Gill was unlucky as he couldn't get to his century. There have been only two centuries in the series,"" Basit said.India have already lost the series, trailing 0-2 and are looking to win the Mumbai Test to avoid an embarrassing home whitewash.","Former Pakistan cricketer Basit Ali has advised head coach to go in with the left-right combination.

NEW DELHI: India's hopes of salvaging a win in the third and final Test against New Zealand will rest heavily on the shoulders of their senior batters, especially Virat Kohli , as they prepare for a tricky fourth-innings run chase on a turning Wankhede pitch.New Zealand were bowled out for 174 early on Day 3, leaving India to chase 147 to win on Sunday.With the pitch offering sharp turn and spinners dominating the match so far, Kohli's role in guiding India to victory will be pivotal. Ravindra Jadeja (5-55) and Ravichandran Ashwin (3-63) took eight wickets between them to put India in a commanding position, but New Zealand's potent spin attack, led by Ajaz Patel , looms large.Kohli has had a tough series, and all eyes will be on him to deliver a match-winning performance in what promises to be a tense, low-scoring contest. The former Indian captain has struggled with consistency in this series, managing just one notable knock — a fighting 70 in the first Test in Bengaluru, which came in a losing cause after India's collapse for their lowest-ever home total of 46 in the first innings.In the second Test in Pune, Kohli's struggles continued as he scored only 1 and 17 in India's 113-run defeat, which gave New Zealand their first-ever Test series win on Indian soil and ended India's 12-year streak of 18 consecutive home Test series victories.This series has been a forgettable one for the 35-year-old, who has faced immense scrutiny after being run out for just 4 in the first innings of the ongoing Test, a dismissal that came at a crucial juncture on the opening day.India, who posted 263 in their first innings thanks to Shubman Gill's 90 and Rishabh Pant's 60, took a 28-run lead, but the final innings will present a different challenge altogether.The Wankhede pitch has already seen spinners claim 25 of the 30 wickets so far in the match, with Ajaz Patel taking a five-wicket haul (5-103) in the first innings. Patel, who has a staggering 19 wickets at the Wankhede in just three innings, will be the biggest threat to India's chase. New Zealand will also rely on the likes of Ish Sodhi, Glenn Phillips, and Rachin Ravindra to exploit the conditions.Kohli will need to lead from the front, especially as India cannot always rely on their younger batters, like Gill and Pant, to rescue them in tough conditions. Senior players, including Kohli and Rohit Sharma , will have to handle the pressure and ensure that India chase the target efficiently.For Kohli, this match represents an opportunity not only to redeem himself but also to gain valuable form ahead of the high-profile Border-Gavaskar Trophy against Australia, which will be crucial for India's World Test Championship aspirations. A match-winning innings here would not only give India a consolation win in the series but also provide the veteran batter a much-needed confidence boost.With New Zealand having spun their way to victories in Bengaluru and Pune, India will need Kohli to dig deep and navigate a challenging pitch to prevent a rare series whitewash at home. The stage is set for a classic fourth-innings battle, and Kohli's experience could make all the difference.","New Zealand were bowled out for 174 early on Day 3, leaving India to chase 147 to win on Sunday.

Can Smriti Mandhana break Meg Lanning's record to become leading century-maker in ODIs?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/can-smriti-mandhana-break-meg-lannings-record-to-become-leading-century-maker-in-odis/articleshow/114900994.cms,"Smriti Mandhana (BCCI Photo)

NEW DELHI: Smriti Mandhana has achieved a new milestone in Indian women’s cricket by surpassing Mithali Raj 's record for the most ODI centuries scored by an Indian woman. With her latest century, Mandhana now has eight ODI hundreds, overtaking Raj’s tally of seven centuries.Already recognized as one of India’s finest batters, Mandhana is on a promising journey toward challenging Meg Lanning 's record of 15 ODI centuries. At 27, she is in her prime and has ample time to pursue this feat, especially having reached her current tally in just 88 matches.In her ODI career so far, Mandhana has accumulated 3,690 runs with an average of 45.00 and a strike rate of 84.92. In addition to her eight centuries, she has 27 half-centuries to her name. Lanning, Australia’s prolific batter, scored her 15 centuries across 103 ODIs with a remarkable average of 53.51.Mandhana’s consistency and aggressive style provide a strong foundation to surpass this milestone. Her average and strike rate rank her among the best in the game, highlighting her ability to consistently score big runs.Mandhana recently notched her eighth century in the third ODI against New Zealand, scoring 100 off 122 balls to lead India in a 233-run chase, securing a 2-1 series victory.Reflecting on her performance, the 28-year-old commented, ""Initially when the first two matches don't go your way as a batter and you get out in a similar fashion, sometimes it does play on your mind. But I think this innings for me was a lot of talking to myself. I don't think I've left that many balls in One-dayers in the last four, five years. It was tough to watch the scorecard because I don't see myself playing the slow innings. But Harman kept telling me that, do it for the team, do it for the team. So that kept me going. The partnerships were really crucial.""Mandhana also acknowledged the team’s disappointment with their T20 World Cup showing in UAE, stating, ""It's not been easy, the last one and a half months for the team. We had a lot of expectations from all of us individually and as a team in the World Cup. The series came too soon for everyone. Half of everyone's mind was still on the World Cup. This series win (against NZ) is definitely going to boost confidence, especially this being such a young team, they take things to heart. I'm really happy that we could win the series today and start the journey again.""","Smriti Mandhana surpasses Mithali Raj's record for most ODI centuries by an Indian woman.

(Photo by Idrees Mohammed/AFP via Getty Images)

NEW DELHI: Imagine handed over the Test captaincy and first up is a tour of India, who hadn't lost a Test series at home since 2012.Not just that, leading a side that had not only ever won a Test series in India but also emerged winners in only two Test matches in India since the first Test they played in India since 1955, with the first win coming at Nagpur in 1969 and the second at Mumbai in 1988.Two victories for the Kiwis out of the 36 Tests in India. Not even the long-standing and highly successful New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming could win a Test in India.So history favoured India. With an impeccable record at home and match-winners to boost, no one gave the Kiwis a chance to ruffle a feather.But as they say that fortune favours the brave, Tom Latham was ready for his maiden full-time Test assignment.With a level-headed approach, Latham brought a calm and methodical style to leadership. His demeanor on the field helped maintain team morale, especially in tense situations, which was crucial in the longest format.In Latham's own words, it was a good toss to lose for the Kiwis when India captain Rohit Sharma chose to bat in the first Test at Bengaluru.Making excellent use of the overcast conditions, the Kiwis bundled out India for their lowest ever Test total at home - 46 and though India tried to fight back in the second innings, Latham & Co. didn't loosen their grip and won the match by 8 wickets.In the second Test on a turning track in Pune, Mitchell Santner ran through the Indians with 13 wickets in the match, but Latham's 86 in the second innings was very crucial in setting India a stiff victory target of 359 runs, which in the end the hosts fell short of, handing the Kiwis a 113-run win and their maiden Test series victory on Indian soil. A hoodoo broken. History created.Latham's experience as an opening batsman and a seasoned Test player gave him a deep understanding of New Zealand's strengths and weaknesses. He relied on a balanced strategy, rotated bowlers effectively and adjusted fields in response to India's batting style, which was effective in helping his team maintain pressure.Latham exemplified the traits of resilience and discipline in Test cricket. He encouraged his team to play with patience, whether that meant grinding out runs or bowling in tight, consistent areas to frustrate India batters. His approach reflected his own style as a batsman, emphasizing solid technique and composure.Latham showed trust in younger players and backed their abilities. This support helped players like Daryl Mitchell and Will Young step up when needed, adding to New Zealand's depth and adaptability.While Latham may not have as aggressive a captaincy style as some others, his balanced and steady approach aligned well with New Zealand's team ethos. His leadership provided stability and confidence, ensuring the Kiwis made history in India.And to achieve this without the services of batting mainstay Kane Williamson , who missed all the three Tests due to injury, Tom Latham might as well go down in history as one of the finest captains to lead the New Zealand cricket team.",New Zealand captain Tom Latham led Kiwis to historic Test series win in India. New Zealand had only won two Test matches in India since the first Test they played in India in 1955. Latham will go down in history as one of the finest captains to lead the New Zealand cricket team.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114900776,imgsize-42494,width-400,resizemode-4/114900776.jpg"

He was reduced to playing second fiddle in Pune as Mitchell Santner ran through the hosts.Santner was ruled out of the Mumbai Test and Patel found his mojo to rekindle his love affair with the Wankhede Stadium , the site of his greatest moment in Test cricket — a 10-wicket haul in 2021. On Saturday, his 5/103 helped Black Caps restrict India to 263 in their first innings.""We’re going to try our best to restrict India and try to bowl them out, but it’ll be interesting to see how the wicket continues to play tomorrow. The morning sessions have been a bit different to the afternoon sessions, so if the wicket continues to play like that, if we bowl well and do our best, I think we might have a decent chance,"" said Patel.He lauded Shubman Gill and Rishabh Pant for the way they batted.""It’s not an easy surface to bat on, so those runs (by Shubman) were extremely valuable. Rishabh's innings was a big thing too because if we had got him out early, it could have changed the dynamics of the game.""",Ajaz Patel takes wicket of Ravichandran Ashwin in third Test in Mumbai.

MUMBAI: It was the sort of moment which makes us fall in love with the sport of bat and ball all over again. Ravichandran Ashwin , having endured a lean run and ceded the spotlight to younger off-spin colleague Washington Sundar in Pune, won hearts as he pulled off the best catch of his life here on Saturday.Running sideways for almost 19 metres from mid-on after Daryl Mitchell tonked a spinning delivery from Ravindra Jadeja Ashwin , all of 38, launched himself into a dive to take a blinder. The catch ended a 50-run fourth partnership in 83 balls between Mitchell and Will Young (51; 100b, 2x4, 1x6) and turned things back India's way. The way he let off a scream and threw the ball in the air, and the way his teammates hugged him after that brilliant catch, was testament to what Ashwin means to this side.Charged up after that piece of magic, Ashwin unleashed a string in his bow. Two deadly carrom balls accounted for the dangerous-looking Glenn Phillips and Young, with both batters perhaps expecting the ball to turn. In the process, Ashwin became the most successful bowler at the Wankhede with 41 wickets, breaking leg-spin great Anil Kumble's record of 38. He had earlier foxed the dangerous Rachin Ravindra too.On an eventful Day 2 which saw 15 wickets fall on a pitch where the ball was turning square, India's spin twins roared back into form. Ashwin (3/63 in 16 overs) and Ravindra Jadeja (4/52 in 12.3 overs) combined beautifully to run through New Zealand, who took stumps at 171/9 in their second innings for a lead of 143 runs.Earlier, impressive seamer Akash Deep gave India he perfect start as he bowled Kiwi skipper Tom Latham though the gate with one that jagged back in after pitching.Jadeja (match figures of 9/119) too has looked unplayable on this wicket and has been India's star bowler. India will now fancy their chances of a consolation win here. However, it must be said that even chasing 150 on this minefield of a pitch, which has seen 29 wickets go down in just two days, will be tricky. Not only is the ball hissing and spitting like a cobra on the typical red soil pitch at the Wankhede, it's also keeping low at times, making batting a hazardous job.The credit for the hosts' fabulous fightback — after they had been reduced to 86/4 overnight due to some mindless cricket — goes to young batting guns Shubman Gill (90; 146b, 7x4, 1x6) and Rishabh Pant (60; 59b, 8x4, 2x6). The duo changed the complexion of the match with their 96-run fifth-wicket partnership off just 114 balls. Pant smashed 60 of those runs, launching into a typically blistering counter-attack.Pant signalled his intentions right from the start, playing some lovely off-drives down the ground for four off the first two balls he faced from Kiwi left-arm spinner Ajaz Patel.The duo plundered 77 runs in the first hour (14 overs) as Pant raced to a 36-ball 50, the fastest by an Indian batsman against New Zealand in Tests, while unfurling his full array of strokes — the lap sweep, reverse sweep, while also dancing down the track twice to deposit Patel into the stands.Sensing that the Pant show was on, Gill, who has lately had to answer a few questions about his ability to play quality spin on turning tracks, chose to sensibly play second fiddle, showcasing his class with an inside out four over cover off Patel. To make things worse for themselves, the Kiwis, unnerved by Pant's assault, dropped sitters that both the batters offered at long on.While Gill's catch was grassed by substitute fielder Mark Chapman when the batter was on 45, Pant was let off by Matt Henry on 53, with offspinner Phillips being the unlucky bowler on both occasions.Gill's missed opportunity, in particular, might cost New Zealand heavily.","Ashwin becomes the most successful bowler at the Wankhede with 41 wickets, breaking leg-spin great Anil Kumble's record of 38.

The morning session will therefore be crucial in understanding how the pitch will play and what approach both teams need to adopt.""It's turning quite sharply, it's inconsistent in terms of how much it does turn and bounce, but as a spinner it's encouraging as well that you're going to get something out of the surface and for batting it's quite challenging,"" he added. ""It is certainly turning from both ends, it's just the bounce is a little bit variable, so from a batting perspective that can be a challenge as well.""Patel acknowledged Rishabh Pant 's counter-attacking 60 as a pivotal moment in the match.""I felt like I bowled really well but Rishabh batted exceptionally, he's been phenomenal throughout this tour and he's kind of the player that's put pressure back on us, regardless of the situation,"" He said. ""As long as you're putting the ball in good areas and you have a good plan and a good set field, then it's about him taking the option and he is being very, very good and taking the right options.""Despite his own success and the commendable performance of New Zealand's spin attack, Patel refrained from claiming superiority over their Indian counterparts.""I don't necessarily believe we've out-bowled the Indian spinners, the class of the Indian bowling attack is quite phenomenal,"" the spinner said.

There is not much to separate the teams that will take the field at Indira Gandhi Athletic Stadium on Sunday.With two wins, two losses, two draws and eight points from their six Indian Super League matches so far this season, NorhEast United FC and Odisha FC occupy the sixth and eighth spots on the league table, courtesy the Highlanders’ better goal difference.Yet, a win in Guwahati on Sunday will go a long way in their season aspirations and that’s exactly what both teams will be playing for.“It’s a game where the one who concedes will lose the three points,” NEUFC head coach Juan Pedro Benali said in the pre-match press conference on Saturday.Spaniard Benali thus emphasised the importance of defence in a match with some of the best attackers in the league — the likes of current league topscorer Alaeddine Ajaraie , NEUFC’s all-time topscorer Parthib Gogoi , Nestor Albiach in home colours and ISL scoring machines Roy Krishna and Diego Mauricio as well as Mourtada Fall in setpieces for the Juggernauts.His stress on the same has been further heightened by NEUFC’s best-ever ISL result — a 5-0 win against Jamshedpur FC — which came at home in the last game, together with their first cleansheet of the season.“The most important thing is we played well, we did what we should do in all the games. Most importantly, we didn’t concede and (I am) happy and proud of the players,” said Benali.With Guillermo Fernandez, too, declared fit for Sunday, the Spanish coach will have a full squad at his disposal to continue the momentum of their best start to an ISL campaign. “The most important thing for us is to win three points at home. It will be a tough game but we are ready for it,” added Benali.Odisha, too, will be riding on the confidence from their recent 2-1 home victory over East Bengal FC and a hard-fought draw against defending champions Mumbai City FC, where they played the last 10 minutes with 10 men.However, they will be without head coach Sergio Lobera, who is suspended for this match, along with their influential midfielder Ahmed Jahouh who earned a red card.But assistant coach Anthony Fernandes, who will step in for this fixture, expressed confidence in the squad’s ability to adjust, and stressed that they have a plan not just against the dangerous Ajaraie but against the entire team.“NorthEast United are playing really well. They are a good team with a good momentum after their 5-0 win. For me (the plans to be formed) are not for any one player, but for their entire team as such,” Fernandez said on Saturday.Sunday will also be the only time in November that the frantic Highlanders fans will have a chance to see their in-form team in action at home with NEUFC set to play three away fixtures from then on.",NorhEast United FC and Odisha FC occupy the sixth and eighth spots on the league table. A win in Guwahati on Sunday will go a long way in their season aspirations. NEUFC’s best-ever ISL result — a 5-0 win against Jamshedpur FC — came at home in the last game.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114889213,imgsize-46862,width-400,resizemode-4/114889213.jpg"

NEW CASTLE: Newcastle put a huge dent in Arsenal 's title aspirations on Saturday, winning 1-0 to give leaders Manchester City the chance to move eight points clear of the Gunners at the top of the Premier League Alexander Isak scored what proved to be the winning goal in the 12th minute, heading home Anthony Gordon's pinpoint cross from the right.Arsenal struggled to get out of first gear and although they dominated possession, they produced just one shot on target in the entire game.Mikel Arteta's men have now picked up just one point in their past three games as their title push quickly runs out of steam.If defending champions City win at Bournemouth later on Saturday they will be eight points clear of the Gunners. Liverpool, a point behind City, host Brighton at Anfield.Arsenal have pushed Pep Guardiola's City hard in each of the past two seasons and appeared to be well-equipped for another title challenge but the gap already looks alarmingly big.The injury-hit visitors started brightly in the opening seconds at St James' Park, with Leandro Trossard dragging the ball wide.But the home side, who had not won for five matches, quickly settled and Sweden forward Isak got between Gabriel and William Saliba to head home from Gordon's exquisite first-time cross.Arsenal winger Bukayo Saka lacked penetration but headed just wide in the 18th minute after leaping above his marker.Newcastle defender Lewis Hall blocked Mikel Merino's shot on the line after a Declan Rice corner caused chaos but the visitors lacked rhythm and failed to match the intensity shown by the home side.Arteta opted against making changes at half-time and Newcastle came close to doubling their lead almost immediately, with Joe Willock's shot saved by David Raya.The Spanish boss threw on 17-year-old Ethan Nwaneri and Oleksandr Zinchenko for Gabriel Martinelli and Merino just after the hour mark.Isak fired a shot at Raya that the Arsenal goalkeeper pushed away before Rice muscled his way into the Newcastle area and flashed a shot wide.Arteta made further changes, introducing defender Ben White and forward Gabriel Jesus in the desperate push for an equaliser.Arsenal struggled to build up a head of steam as the clock ticked down but they squandered a golden chance to equalise when Rice headed just wide from a Saka cross in stoppage time.The Gunners, still missing captain Martin Odegaard, suffered a shock defeat against Bournemouth last month and drew 2-2 with Liverpool last week.They have tough games coming up against Inter Milan in the Champions League and Chelsea next week.The win lifts Eddie Howe's Newcastle to eighth in the table ahead of the later kick-offs on Saturday.",Newcastle beat Arsenal 1-0 at St James' Park. Alexander Isak scored the only goal of the game in the 12th minute. Arsenal have now picked up just one point in their past three games.

East Bengal down Nejmeh to reach AFC Challenge League quarterfinals,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/east-bengal-down-nejmeh-to-reach-afc-challenge-league-quarterfinals/articleshow/114857952.cms,"(Photo credit: East Bengal FC)

East Bengal FC — battered and bruised in the domestic league and with their backs to the wall — finally found their place in the sun in Asian football —on the bank of river Raidak in the capital of Bhutan.New coach Oscar Bruzon pulled a rabbit out of his hat as the red-and-gold brigade got the better of Lebanese side Nejmeh FC 3-2 to top Group A of the AFC Challenge League and sealed a place in the quarterfinals of Asia’s revamped third-tier club football.An own goal by Abdulai Musah in the 8th minute and another poacher’s strike from Dimitri Diamantakos in the 15th minute put Bruzon’s team in firm control of the proceedings. But Nejmeh — who came into the match with back-to-back wins and needed a draw to top the group — refused to be cowed down by the Kolkata team’s early onslaught and were soon back in the contest on the back of Collins Opare and Hussain Monzer in 19 and 43 minutes, respectively.As the Lebanese team grew into the contest with more purpose after the break and threatened to pinprick East Bengal’s talk of a resurgence, the combination of Madih Talal and Diamantakos delivered the coup de grace. Talal earned a penalty and Diamantakos sent the rival goalkeeper Ali Sabeh the wrong way from the spot in the 77th minute to help East Bengal cross the Nejmeh hurdle in style and book a place in the quarterfinals.Diamantakos proved why the team management sought his signature so desperately, finishing the Challenge League’s group stage with 4 goals, scoring in all three matches in Thimphu. Nine years after returning to Asian football, it was also quite a statement made by a red-and-golds brigade, who lost 8 matches in a row in domestic football and now finishing the group stage of an AFC competition with an unbeaten run, winning two of the 3 matches and scoring 9 goals.Yet, odds were heavily stacked against them when they reached Bhutan’s capital. Bruzon’s era began with back-to-back losses (0-2 vs Mohun Bagan SG and 1-2 vs Odisha FC) in the Indian Super League. But in less than a couple of weeks’ time, East Bengal looked a transformed side, still not at their best physically but playing with more purpose and potency.Yet, Nejmeh offered them the stiffest test. East Bengal — who came into Friday’s group-deciding game following a 2-2 draw with hosts Paro FC and a 4-0 demolition of Bangladesh champions Bashundhara Kings — never managed to defeat the Lebanese team, going down to them in their previous two meetings.But East Bengal set themselves perfectly on their road to self-discovery at the Changlimithang Stadium on Friday. Musah under the challenge of Diamantakos, sent his header into his own net following Talal’s corner and when East Bengal came calling again, Mahesh Naorem Singh sent his delivery perfectly across the face of goal for the Greek striker to tap home.It was a dream start for East Bengal but two defensive mistakes allowed Nejmeh to come back into the game in the first half itself and on both occasions, Hector Yuste was responsible. The Spanish defender, who started despite being a doubtful starter, seemed to have been bogged down by his muscle injury when he failed to chase Opare, allowing the latter to beat Prabhsukhan Gill.On the second occasion, he committed a foul near the D and Monzer curled his free-kick perfectly over the wall to let it settle into the top corner.Nejmeh began the second half with the same attacking tempo and Ali Alrida and Hussan Kourani missed a sitter with a gaping goal in front of them.Soon, it was Nandhakumar Sekar’s turn to let go of another opportunity at the other end, when he was set by Provat Lakra, the second-half replacement of Yuste.Nejmeh also upped their ante, Gill staying alert to deal with a few sorties, and urging his defence to stay alert and keep believing in themselves.Then came Tatal’s turn, drawing a foul from Alrida and Diamantakos stepped up to send home the penalty and take East Bengal into the knockout stage.","East Bengal FC beat Lebanese side Nejmeh FC 3-2 to top Group A of the AFC Challenge League.

'One of the best'

Alexander Zverev beat fierce rival Stefanos Tsitsipas in the quarter-finals of the Paris Masters on Friday, while Holger Rune edged Alex de Minaur to keep alive his hopes of reaching the ATP Tour Finals .Zverev's 7-5, 6-4 win over Tsitsipas kept him in the running to claim his first title in Paris after losing to Daniil Medvedev in the 2020 championship match.World number three Zverev -- the highest-ranked player left in the draw -- will face 2022 champion Rune in Saturday's semi-final after the Dane overcame De Minaur 6-4, 4-6, 7-5.The 16th meeting between the 27-year-old German and 26-year-old Greek was evenly matched during a hard-fought first set.""At the beginning, he was outplaying me but then I found my rhythm from the baseline,"" said Zverev on court.""And when I had my chance I used it in the first set.""Indeed once Zverev broke late in the opener and early in the second, it became a comfortable ride to just his sixth win against his long-time Greek rival.The loss ends the chances of the world number 11 Tsitsipas of reaching the end-of-year ATP Finals -- having won the showpiece event in 2019.Tsitsipas and Zverev started cautiously with both offering up opportunities for early breaks in their first service games.But they soon found their range as the first set looked destined to require a tie-break to separate the pair on the quick surface at Paris' Bercy Arena.However, the first break points of the match eventually came with Tsitsipas serving at 5-5, the German claiming the second on a double fault.The Greek saved two set points and secured a break-back point of his own but Zverev dug in to hold.Tsitsipas' shoulders visibly sagged as he offered up break point after break point at 1-1 in the second set.When he dragged a shot long to end a game which had lasted over 15 minutes, his opponent had firmly taken the ascendancy.Zverev, who reached the French Open final in Paris this year, served out to win and move towards a second ATP 1000-level trophy of the season.Former world number four Rune, the 13th seed, needed just one break of serve as he took the opener against De Minaur.In the second set, the 25-year-old Australian started to open up on his groundstrokes, producing several stunning winners off both wings.Rune finally relented when serving at 4-5, offering up three set points to De Minaur who duly converted the second with aplomb.The Australian's first serve gradually deserted him in the decider and Rune capitalised by breaking in the fifth game, but De Minaur struck immediately back to level.A huge net cord that clipped the line on the right side of the court for Rune gave him a 15-0 lead and he took full advantage, breaking to lead 6-5 before consolidating to win the match.""Sascha (Zverev) and I had a great match in Paris, where he took it in five. I beat him one time, he took me last time,"" Rune said of facing Zverev who came out on top when the pair met in a five-set clash in the last 16 of the French Open this year.""He is one of the best players this year, so I will have to be very well prepared.""With the result, both Rune and De Minaur still have a chance of reaching the Tour Finals in Turin, which run November 10-17.Frenchman Ugo Humbert , who downed world number two Carlos Alcaraz in the last 16, delighted the vocal home crowd by beating unseeded Australian Jordan Thompson 6-2, 7-6 (7/4).The world number 18 will face Russian Karen Khachanov in the other semi-final as he attempts to reach a first Masters final of his career and emulate Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in becoming the first French winner in Paris since 2008.Khachanov, the 2018 Paris Masters champion, defeated last year's runner-up Grigor Dimitrov 6-2, 6-3, ending the 33-year-old Bulgarian's hopes of reaching Turin in the process.","Alexander Zverev beats Stefanos Tsitsipas 7-5, 6-4 in Paris Masters quarter- final.

You need to get to a situation for luck to play a role: Arjun Kadhe,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/you-need-to-get-to-a-situation-for-luck-to-play-a-role-arjun-kadhe/articleshow/114661630.cms,"Arjun Kadhe

PUNE: It was his grandparents who sowed the seeds for Arjun Kadhe ’s career as a professional tennis player.More than two decades ago, when Arjun was taking baby steps in tennis, his paternal grandfather decided to sell their house and set aside the proceeds exclusively to help his grandson follow a dream.“I remember when I was eight years old … at that point we were not financially so super to think about tennis as a viable option for my career. But my granddad had a vision. He told me, ‘Okay, I will do anything. You just play tennis, you want to represent India, you want to play a Grand Slam ’. My parents were living on rent. It was unbelievable,” an emotional Kadhe, 30, said as he jogged his memory back.All the sacrifices, of his and of those around him, and the years of tireless pursuit of excellence bore fruit last week when Arjun claimed his first ATP Tour doubles title , in partnership with Rithvik Choudary at the Almaty Open in Kazakhstan last week.“The credit goes first to my parents, they've made huge sacrifices, then my coaches. Obviously, it's a team effort,” he said.""Obviously, Balu sir (coach M Balachandran) traveling with us, (former South African player) Raven (Klaasen) traveling with us, the Double Dream of India programme is helping us a lot.“And as you said, the journey is long, but it feels really, really good, because you get rewarded. In doubles you're playing 35 weeks alone on the road, and it can be really brutal sometimes.“So this win, we both want to take it in, get confidence, enjoy and go ahead again.”The Indian combination beat three teams ranked in the top-30 on the ATP Tour, including No. 13 pair Sadio Doumbia and Fabien Reboul of France in the second round.In a thriller of a final, Arjun and Rithvik saved five match points in the super tiebreak to beat Germany’s Jakob Schnaitter and Mark Wallner, ranked 26th, 3-6, 7-6 (3), 14-12. Remarkably, the Indians won only 68 points to their rivals’ 80 in the match.Arjun acknowledged that luck played its part in their win, but the team needed to work hard to get there in the first place.“I think luck played a big part. But at the same time, we were just talking, the coaches were telling us we lost two finals in the super tiebreak, where we were the better team, in the Challengers. As (personal coach) Hemant (Bendrey) sir was also saying, luck is there, but you have to get yourself into that situation for luck to play it out,” Arjun said.The Punekar, supported by Punit Balan group , rose to a career-high 77 in the individual doubles ranking after the win.“I'm really grateful that it has happened, but at the same time, I feel I was playing a good level,” he said.“It's about, you know, being there, giving yourself that chance, getting rejected, at some point it will come.“It's not in your hands when that click comes. For some people, it comes early. If they can sustain it, they move to the next level.“Some people get rejected, and get that breakthrough. It's about working hard and trying to improve, and take the next step. Everyone has their own journey, in my opinion.“I feel we deserve it, because I truly believe we have the level. Now it's about going the long way and trying to improve every day and not be satisfied with this one tournament.”Arjun had partnered Rithvik in the latter half of last season but parted ways at the start of 2024. Even before they combined, the Telangana lad had mentioned to Arjun of his desire to play with his previous partner Niki Poonacha whenever he decided to focus on doubles. So, the Maharashtra player was understandably cautious when Rithvik reached out to him in the middle of this season.“I feel like every challenge brings opportunity. At that point (when Rithvik chose to go back to Niki at the start of 2024), I was like, ‘oh my God. we are doing well, blah, blah, blah, what is happening?’ But then, if I look back now, I won (two Challenger) titles (with Jeevan Nedunchezhiyan and Anirudh Chandrasekar),” Arjun said.“So it was really good for me.”This time around, Arjun said, the two were in for the long haul. And long-term partnership is something he strongly believes in.“To develop a good team, you need time,” he said, “because if you keep switching partners, the first few weeks of understanding how we want to play, understanding how my partner wants us to play in the future, what is our best?“For all that to align it takes a little bit of time, and in doubles you have super tiebreak. Sometimes you are winning from (facing) match points, sometimes losing from match points.”The Almaty title had given a pleasant surprise for both Arjun and Rithvik in terms of ranking jump — the latter had broken into the top-100 for the first time in his career, reaching 85 in the ATP charts.That means they will now give it a shot to make the Australian Open cut before closing the season.“Now it's about planning it smartly, taking care of your body, because it's the end of the year, you don't want to overplay,” he said.“If we want to be top-50 in the world, we need to improve a lot. We won this tournament, but those teams are doing so many things better than us. So, it’s important also to play the big events, lose, and then realize this is where we are at.“So, we are not thinking too far ahead, just trying to think next week. How can we try and make Australia? If we don't make it, we still have to try and make French.“The plan will go forward from there.”","Arjun Kadhe claims his first ATP Tour doubles title with Rithvik Choudary at Almaty Open in Kazakhstan. The 30-year-old rose to a career-high 77 in the individual doubles ranking after the win. Arjun acknowledged that luck played its part in their win, but the team needed to work hard.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114661721,imgsize-157286,width-400,resizemode-4/114661721.jpg"
My fighting spirit helped me win my first ITF title: Tanisha Kashyap,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/my-fighting-spirit-helped-me-win-my-first-itf-title-tanisha-kashyap/articleshow/114554193.cms,"Tanisha Kashyap in action during the $15,000 ITF women's tennis event in Bengaluru last week. (Photo Credit: KSLTA/Deepthi Indukuri)

For Tanisha Kashyap , 22, the $15,000 ITF title in Bengaluru last week will remain special for many reasons, not least because it's her first one on the pro circuit.""This one's really special because it's in my home country, in India, and it's something that I've waited for a while,"" Tanisha said.""I'm really glad how I performed in the week I was actually injured. I had a neck catch which led to my shoulders because of the continuous matches that I played.""And it was tough each and every match to play with that pain, but I managed it really well. Mentally, I stayed strong and I relied on my fitness to win this title.""Tanisha, world ranked 868, overcame Akanksha Nitture 6-7 (5), 6-1, 6-1 in the final of the hard court event.The triumph was made all the more memorable by the difficult start to the season wherein she was rendered out of action for three months after undergoing a ""mini surgery"" to treat a meniscus and ACL tear.Tanisha suffered the injury during an event in Monastir, Tunisia, in early April. She was leading in the second set against Finland'sAnastasia Kulikova , a former top-200 player with nine pro titles, when she felt pain but played through it. It was only the following day when she underwent scan, she discovered the full extent of the injury.""I cannot disclose what treatment I got, because I was treated by (Daniil) Medvedev's doctor … (I was) set back for three to four weeks,"" she said.""I was completely off from tennis. I was on crutches. I didn't play for three-four (sic) months. I was just building back my fitness and building the strength of my knee and everything.""So I would say this year has been tough, mentally, physically, and I had to face a lot adversities in the beginning because it was not looking that great.""But through it all, I stayed positive and didn't lose sight of my goal. I worked hard each and every day to build myself back up from injury … to get to where I'm right now, to lift my first pro title.""The time away from action and the subsequent comeback helped her understand her game better.""When I did start, it was also very tough, because when you start to play tournaments, you're trying to figure it out again because there's some pain or there's a certain movement that's bothering you.""So you have to find out, you have to go back and do therapy. It was a process to figure it out and to also strengthen my quads back up to support my knee. So, it was tough.""But, sometimes when there's a lot of chaos, when you have a lot of time, you can really think about tennis from an outside perspective, and you get to know yourself better.""Tunisia seems to be Tanisha's favourite hunting ground, at least this year, and it was for a reason.""The best probable reason why I frequently played in Monastir (is) because I've been boarding in All In Tennis Academy (in France), and it's very close,"" she said.""It's not that expensive to travel, not much of jet lag. And the level of the tournaments in Monastir are way, way, much higher than other places.""And I was still fresh off an injury. If you're injured and suddenly go to Thailand, what do you do? You go to Indonesia, you spend all that money for two weeks and you might not perform well.""It was in Monastir while she was finding her way back in July that she first felt a catch in the neck, which forced her to retire from a $15K event in the second round when she was leading 6-2, 4-1 against Spaniard Victoria Gomez O'Hayon.It was the same issue that cropped up in Bengaluru at the very start of the tournament, and she showed tremendous grit to play through the pain and obvious discomfort it put her in.""Right before my first round, in a certain movement, I jerked it, and I had the same neck catch again,"" she said.""I couldn't look up, I couldn't look to my right, I couldn't serve. And I think throughout this tournament, I had so many double faults. I'm sure the statistics are there.""It taught me something. I stayed strong, I battled each and every point. I ran for each and every shot. I didn't, you know, let anything go. So, that fighting spirit really helped me win this tournament.""And, of course, some strategy here and there, and to play smart tennis.""Smart tennis she did have to play in the final which lasted two hours and 19 minutes.""I knew that I had limited range of motion, and I knew that I couldn't blast my first serves, how I was blasting in Mysuru or before. So I knew that I had to tennis wise, play smart, and place the ball and start off the point and stay in the rallies for my match.""For sure, the neck started to act during the first set, which lasted more than an hour and a half. She delivered nine double faults in the opener, compared to just one for the remainder of the match.""When I was four or five down, my neck started to really catch again, and it was really extremely painful. So I had no other option to call the physio,"" Tanisha said.""The second and third, I took a breather. I just kind of meditated and focused on my game strategy … to place the balls away from her striking zone and to make her work for each and every point.And maybe she wasn't expecting, maybe she thought that I would be tired out and I wouldn't fight back. But I've always been a fighter, and I stayed strong mentally and just stayed in it, and I let her make the errors.""I was calm and cool. I can't explain it, but you know, I just went into my zone.""Tanisha has been mainly coached by her father Suresh Kalita. But she had worked with former Davis Cupper Vishaal Uppal and Billie Jean King Cup player Rushmi Chakravarthi among other coaches. She also had a short stint at the JC Ferrero Tennis Academy in Spain before heading to the Ohio State University to play college tennis.Having seen her share of tennis abroad, the Assam native believes that while the ""commitment level and fitness level"" were the areas where Indian players lagged, it was not necessary that they had to relocate to elsewhere to make the breakthrough.""We can definitely do that here as well. Like I said, it depends on the individual and how much they want to do it.""They might be doing the same exercises that the Europeans are doing, but it's not up to the standard that the Europeans are doing. In the sense, the effort, the physical ability, how much you are pushing yourself.""I've always believed that it's an individual's choice. And, there are some great tennis coaches, fitness coaches here. But in the end of the day, it's how hard you push yourself.""As for herself, Tanisha is not ready to rest on her Bengaluru laurels.""""This is just the beginning of something,"" she said, ""it's a good achievement, but I'm looking for more. I'm gonna get back to train and recover, to win some more, hopefully soon.""It's just one of the small stepping stones towards the bigger picture and the bigger goal.""","Tanisha Kashyap, 22, won the $15,000 ITF title in Bengaluru last week.
