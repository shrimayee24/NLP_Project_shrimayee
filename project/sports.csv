Their explosive 210-run partnership showcased absolute dominance, with Gill's aggressive 103 and Sudharsan's equally impressive 104 leaving CSK's spinners, especially Ravindra Jadeja, struggling. Gill's half-century, sealed with a towering six, preceded Sudharsan's century, marked by a boundary past square leg, highlighting their remarkable performance.In CSK's chase, David Miller's direct hit initiated Rachin Ravindra's run-out, setting the tone early.Sandeep Warrier and Rashid Khan's early breakthroughs left CSK reeling at 10/3.

In short:

How we calculate the chances

With 11 games left to be played in the league stage of IPL 2024, there remain 2,048 possible combinations of match results. No one is yet certain of making the playoffs, but two teams ( MI and PBKS) are totally ruled out.We look at the chances of each team:The team currently topping the table have a 36% chance of finishing the sole toppers and they could do that even with just one win from their remaining three games.Their chances of finishing joint toppers on points are an impressive 62.5%. At worst they can finish tied for third spot. Yet, they are still not sure of making the playoffs. If they lose all their remaining games, they could end up tied third with any two of CSK DC and LSG depending on results in other games, leaving it to net run rates to see who goes through. But there's just a 0.2% chance of such a scenario.Like KKR, they have a 36% chance of being sole toppers at the end of the league phase and a 62.5% chance of being at least tied for the first spot on points. Yet, they too are still not sure of making the playoffs. If they lose all their remaining games, they could end up tied third with any two of CSK, DC or LSG depending on results in other games. But again, there's just a 0.8% chance of such a scenario.Currently in third place, SRH have nearly 97% chance of finishing among the top four in terms of points. The best they can hope for is a joint first spot with one or two other teams and the chances of that are a little over 2%.In fourth place despite Friday's loss, CSK have a little over 56% chance of finishing within the top four slots either singly or jointly. The best they can do is tied for second spot with one to three other teams. And the chances of that are just 7%.Fifth placed DC have no chance of finishing the toppers or even joint toppers. Their chances of ending up among the top four singly or jointly are about 58%. Their best case scenario is joint second on points and there's a little under 5% chance of that happening.Sixth placed LSG's chances of making the top four singly or jointly are also about 58%. Like DC, the best they can do is tie for the second spot with one to three other teams. The chances of that happening are just under 5%.RCB remain in seventh place and their chances of finishing among the top four on points, singly or jointly, are a tad over 20%. Their best case scenario is joint third with two to five other teams and the chances of that are a little under 5%.With Friday's win, GT have climbed off the bottom of the table, but their chances of making it to the top four on points, singly or jointly, are still under 16%. Their best case scenario is joint third with three to five other teams and there's a less than 5% chance of that happening.Their run for the playoffs have ended. Even the chances of a joint fifth spot are a lowly 0.6%.MI too are out of the playoffs. They can at best end up joint 5th and even that is just a 1.2% chance.Bet on KKR and RR making the playoffs and SRH most likely to join them, leaving CSK, LSG and DC battling it out for the fourth spot. For RCB or GT to get into the mix would need many results to go their way.With 11 games remaining, there remain 2,048 possible combinations of match outcomes. We look at each one of those and what it would mean in terms of the final rankings of the teams. Then we work out the percentage of outcomes that would give team ""A"" a chance of finishing in the top four, or the first spot and so on. The underlying assumption is that any given match is a 50-50 game, not unreasonable given how the IPL has unfolded this year and in other years. For instance, of the 2,048 combinations, GT finish among the top four slots singly or jointly in only 320 combinations, which means a 15.6% chance of making the top four spots singly or jointly.","No one is yet certain of making the playoffs, but two teams ( MI and PBKS) are totally ruled out.

In short:

How we calculate the chances:

With 10 games left to be played in the league stage of IPL 2024, there remain 1,024 possible combinations of match results. KKR are now sure to make the playoffs while MI and PBKS are totally ruled out.We look at the chances of each team:The team currently topping the table, their chances of finishing sole toppers have moved up to 50% with Saturday's win.Their chances of finishing joint toppers on points also moved up to 75%. At worst they can finish tied for second spot with one other team ( SRH ).KKR beating MI on Saturday meant that RR's chances of being sole toppers fell from 36% to 25% and their chances of at least tying for the top spot from 62.5% to 50%. They are still not sure of making the playoffs. If they lose all their remaining games, they could end up tied third with any two of CSK DC or LSG depending on results in other games. But there's an under 0.8% chance of such a scenario.Currently in third place, SRH have nearly 97% chance of finishing among the top four in terms of points. The best they can hope for is a joint first spot with one or two other teams and the chances of that are only at 1.6%.In fourth place, CSK have a little over 56% chance of finishing within the top four slots either singly or jointly. The best they can do is tied for second spot with one to three other teams. And the chances of that are just under 5%.Fifth placed DC have no chance of finishing the toppers or even joint toppers. Their chances of ending up among the top four singly or jointly are about 58%. Their best case scenario is joint second on points and there's a 2.3% chance of that happening.Sixth placed LSG's chances of making the top four singly or jointly are also about 58%. Like DC, the best they can do is tie for the second spot with one to three other teams. The chances of that happening are just 2.3%.RCB remain in seventh place and their chances of finishing among the top four on points, singly or jointly, are a tad over 20%. Their best case scenario is joint third with two to five other teams and the chances of that are a little under 5%.Currently eighth, GT still have a nearly 16% chance of making it to the top four on points, singly or jointly. Their best case scenario is joint third with three to five other teams and there's a less than 5% chance of that happening.Their run for the playoffs have ended. Even the chances of a joint fifth spot are a lowly 0.6%.MI too are out of the playoffs. They can at best end up joint 7th and even that is just a 2.3% chance.KKR are through to the playoffs. Bet on RR too making it and SRH most likely to join them, leaving CSK, LSG and DC battling it out for the fourth spot. For RCB or GT to get into the mix would need many results to go their way.With 10 games remaining, there remain 1,024 possible combinations of match outcomes. We look at each one of those and what it would mean in terms of the final rankings of the teams. Then we work out the percentage of outcomes that would give team ""A"" a chance of finishing in the top four, or the first spot and so on. The underlying assumption is that any given match is a 50-50 game, not unreasonable given how the IPL has unfolded this year and in other years. For instance, of the 1,024 combinations, RR finish at the top slot singly or jointly in 512 combinations, which means a 50% chance of being sole or joint toppers.","With 10 games remaining, there remain 1,024 possible combinations of match results.

Shubman Gill and Sai Sudharsan's outstanding centuries propelled GT to a formidable total of 231/3, ultimately proving too challenging for CSK to chase down as they were restricted to 196/8.Despite the loss, the highlight of the match was MS Dhoni 's valiant effort with the bat.Arriving at No.8, Dhoni showcased his trademark big-hitting prowess, smashing three towering sixes in the final over. However, his heroics were not enough to salvage the match for CSK.Throughout IPL 2024 , Dhoni's batting position has been a subject of debate, with many questioning his placement in the lower order. Former cricketer Virender Sehwag weighed in on the discussion, urging for an end to the debate surrounding Dhoni's number.""We should end the debate around MS Dhoni's batting position. He knows what he wants to do. It's his wish. But if you want to win the match, the form he is in, and the strike rate that he's batting at... the other batters need to play at a similar level,"" Sehwag emphasized.""I don't want to get into the debate. Wherever he bats, it's fine. He played fine, entertained the public, who cares if they win or lose? He entertained the public, that's it,"" Sehwag further said.Earlier, CSK's head coach, Stephen Fleming , defended Dhoni's batting position, highlighting the veteran's influence on the team.""Don't underestimate his influence on the team just because he comes in at No. 9. There's a timing aspect, but we're very wary of what he can give us. And we'll max that out,"" Fleming asserted.Fleming also emphasized the importance of managing Dhoni's workload to prevent injuries, affirming that the wicketkeeper-batter remains a crucial asset to the team's success.","CSK suffered their sixth defeat of the season on Friday, losing by 35 runs against Gujarat Titans in Ahmedabad.

End of Rahul Dravid era?

Impact Player rule was a 'test case'

2027 WTC final

may be held outside UK

No increase in domestic match fee

MUMBAI: Rahul Dravid 's stint as the Indian cricket team 's head coach may be coming to an end, with BCCI secretary Jay Shah announcing that the board will advertise for a new head coach in the next few days. Shah clarified that ""Dravid can reapply for the job, if he wants to"".The new coach will be appointed for a three-year term extending to 2027 ODI World Cup Shah did not rule out the possibility of BCCI hiring a foreign coach. India are unlikely to opt for a split coaching role for limited overs and Test formats.Dravid, who took over in November 2021, was handed a short-term extension till the T20 World Cup in US and Caribbean in June. His two-year contract ended with the team's defeat in the final of ODI World Cup last November.TOI has learnt that Dravid is unlikely to reapply for the current job.Other members of the revamped coaching staff, such as batting, bowling, and fielding coaches, will be decided after consulting the new coach. ""We cannot determine whether the new coach will be Indian or foreign. It will be up to the cricket advisory committee (CAC),"" Shah said.The three-member CAC, headed by former batter Ashok Malhotra and including Jatin Paranjape and Sulakshana Naik, will also have to finalise the appointment of a national selector.Shah was non-committal on the continuation of the controversial 'Impact Player' rule in the IPL and stressed that the issue will be decided after consultation with franchises and broadcasters. However, he defended the rule, introduced in the IPL from 2023, on the grounds that it allows two extra Indian players to be in the XI of an IPL side.""Impact player was a test case. Two new Indian players are getting a chance in the IPL. We will discuss with the stakeholders - franchises and broadcasters - before deciding on the continuation of it . It is not permanent, but no one has provided feedback against the rule.""The BCCI's all-important meeting with the franchises to decide on the retention rules will be held soon, he said. TOI has learnt that some franchises are in favour of a s many as eight retentions, while some want none. He also clarified that there have been no discussions on reviving the Champions League T20 tournament, contrary to recent claims made by an official from Cricket Victoria in Mumbai.Shah revealed that the BCCI had taken up the issue of holding the 2027 World Test Championship (WTC) final outside of England with the ICC. The first two WTC finals were held in the UK, while the third one too will be held there - at the Lord's Cricket Ground in 2025.""We have spoken about the ICC for 2027. There are only three main Test centres - India, England, and Australia. You cannot hold it in Australia during that window or even in India,"" he said.There is speculation that Shah will be taking up the position of International Cricket Council (ICC) chairman in November, as Greg Barclay's term ends later this year, but the BCCI secretary didn't reveal his cards. ""Let there be speculation. But let me be here (in the BCCI). Am I not doing a good job?"" he said in jest.Shah said that there will be no increase in the remuneration for domestic players. He also revealed that India's T20 vice-captain Hardik Pandya , who has been awarded an A grade in Central Contracts, has agreed to play in the Syed Mushtaq Ali and Vijay Hazare white-ball domestic tournaments.Shah informed that the High Performance Centre at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) in Bengaluru will be operational from August.","Rahul Dravid can reapply for the job, says BCCI secretary Jay Shah.

NEW DELHI: Kolkata Knight Riders became the first team to qualify for the IPL 2024 playoffs with an 18-run win against Mumbai Indians at the Eden Gardens on Saturday.KKR went through to the playoffs with two away games to spare.The two-time champions posted 157/7 with Venkatesh Iyer top scoring with 42 off 21 balls after being asked to bat first in a 16-overs-a-side match.Mumbai raced to 65/0 before Varun Chakravarthy got the big wickets of impact substitute Rohit Sharma (19) and skipper Hardik Pandya (2).Already out of the playoff race, five-time champions Mumbai finished on 139/8.The official broadcaster of the tournament shared two videos after the match which has former cricketer-turned-commentator Navjot Singh Sidhu lauding the KKR team and their mentor Gautam Gambhir .Sidhu says in the video, ""I see that whenever there is pressure, Gautam Gambhir gets more inspired, that I should go and tell the boys this and that. And it should be exactly like that. Everything is fine when things are normal. Anybody can be a pilot when the sea is calm. But a person's character is tested when the going is tough.""Sidhu adds in another video, ""KKR is the only team which has bowlers who have taken 10-10 wickets and the sixth has taken 9. Show me one team who has this. The most valuable player in the tournament is Sunil Narine. Who got Starc (Mitchell)? Everybody was saying 23 crore, 23 crore. The cynic knows the price of everything and the value of nothing. It is the value addition, boss. Don't measure him in crores, just see what value addition he is bringing. Look at KKR's bowlers, top batsmen, everybody is in form. They stand like recruits, padded-up, all ready to go in anytime. They have one parallel power centre. Everybody will feel they deserve to do that. They have balance, they have a great mentor, they have a superb captain. They have everybody in form. What else do you want? You can't have everything, where will you keep it?""This is the first time KKR have beaten MI both at Wankhede and at the Eden Gardens in an IPL season.",Kolkata Knight Riders qualify for IPL 2024 playoffs with 18-run win against Mumbai Indians.

CHENNAI: A 35-run defeat against Gujarat Titans in Ahmedabad on Friday night has left Chennai Super Kings in a spot of bother.A top-two spot seems off and now the entire focus will be on making the playoffs, for which CSK need to win both their matches. And with no time to recover and reflect on the performance against Titans, a tired CSK will be up against a powerful Rajasthan Royals in a day game on Sunday.It is CSK's last home game and if they do not manage to stay alive for the final two games of the season - second qualifier and final - this may well become MS Dhoni's last match at Chepauk.Royals, who will look to book a playoff berth, came to Chennai on Thursday night, had a couple of good practice sessions and are now ready to put CSK under some serious pressure. Royals might have lost a couple of games back-to-back in the lead-up to this high-voltage clash, but they have the wherewithal to match CSK in every department.Speaking after the loss against Titans, Chennai skipper Ruturaj Gaikwad said that the RR match would be a tough battle. ""It is (the next match) real quick, actually. We get a flight tomorrow (Saturday). It is going to be tough as we will just get up there. And, it will be difficult playing a day game in Chennai, especially against a really good side. But I feel that to stay in the tournament, we need to turn up really well,"" Ruturaj said on Friday.The dew has been a huge factor in the past few games at Chepauk. But on Sunday, with the match being played in the afternoon, dew won't be a factor and the spinners should enjoy the conditions.

The firepower of this line-up can be a big headache for Ruturaj, given the fact that his pace attack is still coming to terms with the departure of Matheesha Pathirana, Mustafizur Rahman and Deepak Chahar.The only bright spot for CSK in their defeat against Titans was the bowling form of Shardul Thakur, who was landing his yorkers and mixing his pace well.

BENGALURU: Just when Delhi Capitals had given themselves a chance in the race to the playoffs, comes a body blow in the shape of a one-match ban for skipper Rishabh Pant .Placed fifth on the table, the 20-run win against Rajasthan Royals on Tuesday came at a hefty price for Capitals. While the financial implication for a slow over-rate is hardly a rap on the knuckles, missing Pant in Sunday's crucial match against RCB could cause damage to the Capitals' prospects.""I think not having our leading run scorer is a loss, but it's also a great challenge for everybody else,"" said DC's head coach Ricky Ponting .The wicketkeeper-batter, who is on a comeback trail following a long lay-off, is the top run-getter for his team with 413 runs. While his deputy Axar Patel will lead in Pant's absence, Abishek Porel would be the automatic choice to take over the role behind the stumps.Capitals have had an indifferent run this season, but have been able to pick themselves up, winning three of their last four matches. Against RCB, they will have to put behind the Pant setback and that won't be an easy task, given the home team's four-match winning streak and their need to put it across Capitals to stay afloat in the competition.A loss at home will snap the chance they have of advancing in the tournament and in the past couple of weeks, Faf du Plessis and his men have shown that they aren't going to give up without a fight.Given the clouds hovering over the M Chinnaswamy stadium and the bowling resources on either side, the match-up should make for an interesting contest. If the RCB bowlers, who showed tremendous discipline and precision in their previous home game against Gujarat Titans, maintain their momentum, the Capitals batters, who have blown hot and cold throughout the season, can ill-afford to slip up.Mohammed Siraj seems to have found his rhythm while left-arm spinner Swapnil Singh has been effective. Capitals too have come with proven wicket-takers with pacers Mukesh Kumar (15 wickets) and Khaleel Ahmed (14) leading the group. But the men who DC will require to deliver are spinners Kuldeep Yadav (14) and Axar (10), both of whom have bowled tight spells.",Delhi Capitals skipper Rishabh Pant banned for one match for slow over-rate.

But Narine had the last laugh and dismissed the destructive Kishan.Narine deceived Kishan with a seam-up delivery as the left hander holed out to midwicket for KKR's first breakthrough.Chakravarthy ended Rohit's forgettable stint at the crease in the next over and finished his four-over spell by dismissing MI skipper Hardik Pandya .Coming in as an impact player, Indian skipper Rohit Sharma 's patchy run of form continued as he looked out of sorts.Rohit was going run-a-ball in his scratchy knock, but that was not a problem for MI as Kishan took the attack to the KKR camp with his flat-batted approach.The left-hander smashed Harshit Rana for two fours and one six, and then took on Narine with successive fours and a six.MI were well on course with 59 for no loss in five overs with a required run-rate of exactly nine runs per over at that stage. But then, KKR's spin duo plotted MI's downfall.Earlier, on a tacky wicket that remained under covers for three days owing to persistent rain in the city, KKR lost their openers -- Phil Salt (6) and Sunil Narine (0) -- in seven balls.Battling a strained hamstring, Iyer lifted KKR after their worst start of the season with his counter-attacking knock after MI won a good toss following a late start because of rain.The highlight of the left-hander's innings was the way he hit Jasprit Bumrah for a six and two fours.Having missed their last 10 matches because of a finger injury, Nitish Rana made a 23-ball 33 during a key partnership with Iyer before getting run out.But Mumbai bounced back well with leg-spinner Piyush Chawla returning figures of 2/38 from his three overs, taking the two key wickets of Iyer and Andre Russell (24 off 14 balls; 2x4, 2x6).Bumrah (2/39 from four overs) ended his splendid spell by dismissing Rinku Singh for a 12-ball 20.(With inouts from PTI)",Kolkata Knight Riders beat Mumbai Indians by 18 runs in IPL match.

As a batting unit, the foundation was there but we could not capitalise and that cost us. The wicket was tacky, so momentum was important but after that we couldn't capitalise. Their score was par, given the conditions I thought the bowlers did well. When the balls returned from the boundary, it hit the cover and was wet. They did well. It seemed par but was a winning total,"" Pandya said at the post match presentation.""Just want to go and enjoy, play good cricket.

"James Anderson, England's enduring 'king of swing'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/james-anderson-englands-enduring-king-of-swing/articleshow/110041470.cms,"(With AFP inputs)

NEW DELHI: James Anderson , a stalwart of cricket and the first pace bowler to reach 700 Test wickets, will retire as one of the game's legendary figures when England takes on West Indies in July.The 41-year-old will conclude his illustrious Test career at Lord's, two decades after his debut. England's head coach Brendon McCullum is focused on laying foundations for the future, keeping an eye on the 2025-26 Ashes series.""I'm going to miss walking out for England so much,"" Anderson said on Saturday.""But I know the time is right to step aside and let others realise their dreams just like I got to, because there is no greater feeling.""Anderson, having surpassed the 700 Test wickets mark, now stands as the third highest wicket-taker in the history of the five-day game. Only two spinners, Sri Lanka's Muttiah Muralitharan (800 Test wickets) and the late Australian great Shane Warne (708), have taken more wickets than Anderson.He achieved this milestone during his 187th Test match on England's tour of India earlier this year, gaining entry into the exclusive '700 club'.The Lancashire seamer has defied his age and the toil of the gruelling Test-match format thanks to his conventional swing bowling skill and an ability to generating reverse-swing later in an innings, while maintaining tight control.Those qualities have helped him pick up 32 five-wicket hauls, with his scalps coming at an average of 26.52.The dynamic leadership of England captain Ben Stokes and McCullum has provided Anderson with fresh inspiration in recent years.In defiance of conventional wisdom about the physical toll of pace bowling, late-career Anderson was just as effective as the spring chicken that flew into the crease two decades previously.Statistics compiled by ESPNCricinfo showed that in the years he was aged 25 to 29, Anderson averaged 28.47 runs per Test wicket.Between 30 and 34, that figure improved to 25.45, and since turning 35, Anderson's average is just under 23.But by calling it quits in his Test career, Anderson will follow in the footsteps of his long-time bowling partner Stuart Broad , who retired after last year's Ashes series in England at the age of 37 with 604 Test wickets.Anderson also played in 194 ODIs and 19 T20s -- he was an unused squad member in England's T20 World Cup success in 2010 -- before his international white-ball career ended in 2015.Prior to Anderson, the last time a quick bowler appeared in Test cricket beyond the age of 40 was when Les Jackson made the second of his two England appearances back in 1961.India's Sachin Tendulkar, an all-time batting great, lauded Anderson's ability to challenge even cricket's greatest run-scorers.""He would hold the ball as if he is bowling an outswinger,"" said Tendulkar.""But the release point, he would try and bring the ball back in.""Anderson's final match will fittingly be at the home of cricket in the first Test of the English summer season from July 10.""English cricket owes Jimmy Anderson a send-off like no other,"" said the English and Wales Cricket Board's chair Richard Thompson.""I don't think we'll ever see a bowler to match Jimmy again. It has been an honour as an England fan to watch him, and to marvel at his skill with the ball.""To still be bowling at the top of his game at 41 is remarkable, and he is a true inspiration and role model for peers and younger generations alike.""",James Anderson will retire from Test cricket at the age of 41. Anderson is the first pace bowler to reach 700 Test wickets. The 41-year-old will play his final Test against West Indies at Lord's.

However, a video circulating on social media shows Rohit expressing his deep affection for the franchise, likening it to a second home for him while talking to KKR assistant coach Abhishek Nayar.Though the noise in the video is not clear due to constant cheering by fans for Rohit in the background, he can be heard saying, ""Ek ek cheez change ho raha hai...Woh unke upar hai...Jo bhi hai woh mera ghar hai bhai, woh temple jo hai na maine banwaya hai."" The last audible line in the chat is ""Bhai mera kya mera to ye last hai"".Though the rest of the conversation is not audible, fans were quick to react to it and speculated that Rohit was talking about the MI captaincy and some fans even alleged that KKR had deleted the video after uploading it on X.Rohit and Nayar go back a long way from their Mumbai domestic cricket days and are good friends.

NEW DELHI: Kylian Mbappe confirmed on Friday his decision to depart from Paris Saint-Germain ( PSG ) at the conclusion of the current season. The French champions, who signed Mbappe from Monaco in 2017 for a staggering 180 million euros ($194 million), are expected to bid farewell to their star player as he likely moves to Real Madrid .""I wanted to announce to you all that it's my last year at Paris Saint-Germain.I will not extend and the adventure will come to an end in a few weeks,"" Mbappe, 25, said in a video posted on social media. ""I will play my last game at the Parc des Princes on Sunday.""PSG, owned by Qatar, have already clinched their 10th Ligue 1 title in the past 12 seasons and will be presented with the trophy following Sunday's match against Toulouse, their final home game of the campaign. However, the team's Champions League aspirations were dashed by Borussia Dortmund in the semi-finals, with a 1-0 home defeat sealing a surprising 2-0 aggregate loss. Consequently, Mbappe will not have the opportunity to bid farewell in the Champions League final at Wembley on June 1, and his seven-year tenure at PSG will conclude without having secured Europe's most prestigious club competition.Mbappe had privately informed PSG of his intention to leave when his contract expires at the end of the season back in February. Although he had not publicly confirmed his departure or his next destination, it is widely believed that he will join Real Madrid. Spanish media reports have suggested that Mbappe has already signed an agreement to join LaLiga champions in July once his PSG contract concludes.""It's a lot of emotions, many years where I had the chance and the great honour to be a member of the biggest French club, one of the best in the world,"" said Mbappe.""It allowed me to arrive here, to have my first experience in a club with a lot of pressure, to grow as a player of course, by being alongside some of the best in history, some of the greatest champions,"" he added. ""It's hard and I never thought it would be this difficult to announce that... but I think I needed this, a new challenge, after seven years.""Mbappe's arrival in Paris as a teenager in 2017 came after he had helped Monaco secure the league title. His transfer fee, initially on loan before becoming permanent, remains the second-largest in football history, coming just weeks after PSG paid a world-record 222 million euros to acquire Neymar from Barcelona.Despite the Qatari takeover in 2011 and the subsequent dominance of French football, PSG have struggled to achieve European success, even with the addition of Lionel Messi to their lineup for two seasons. The closest they came was the 2020 Champions League final defeat by Bayern Munich, where PSG academy graduate Kingsley Coman scored the winning goal against his former club.Mbappe, who has scored 43 goals in all competitions this season, including 26 in Ligue 1, will aim to add to his club-record tally of 255 goals for PSG and secure another medal in the French Cup final on May 25. During his seven years at his hometown team, Mbappe has won six Ligue 1 titles, three French Cups, and the now-defunct League Cup twice.Following Sunday's game, PSG will conclude their league campaign with away matches at Nice and relegation-threatened Metz before Mbappe's final appearance for the club in the Cup final in Lille.Mbappe's relationship with PSG boss Luis Enrique has come under scrutiny since he informed the club of his plans to leave earlier this year. The club had initially frozen him out at the start of the campaign, pressuring him to either sign a new deal or agree to be sold rather than simply running down the final year of his contract.",Kylian Mbappe confirms he will leave Paris Saint-Germain at the end of the season.

's slip was reminiscent of Kahn's butterfingers in 2002 WC final

Goalkeeping howlers, as they say, are part of the game but some stay entrenched in minds much longer after the final whistle has been blown.Magnificent till the 87th minute in the Champions League semifinal's deciding tie against Real Madrid on Wednesday night, Bayern's Manuel Neuer will have nightmares about what happened in the 88th.Even Neuer spills. Even Homer nods.As Neuer stood aghast, from the flash drive of memory popped up a hoary, time-worn visual of Oliver Kahn 's slip from grace. In that gentrified June evening at Yokohama, 22 summers ago, Neuer's illustrious predecessor made a similar faux pas. The eventual Golden Ball winner, the only goalkeeper to win the award in the history of the World Cup, spilled a stinger from Brazil's Rivaldo. Ronaldo, sniffing around like a terrier, did the rest.Kahn's momentary loss of brilliance lost Germany the World Cup.On Wednesday night, Neuer's frozen fingers allowed unheralded Joselu to score and open the gates for Carlo Ancelotti's unrelenting Real Madrid to sneak through to the Champions League final at Wembley.""Anyone who's ever played football knows how I'm feeling right now. That we've been knocked out in the closing stages, having led 1-0 until the (88th minute), it's extremely bitter. We had taken one step to London, we saw ourselves in the final and now I'm lost for words,"" Neuer told the media after his disastrous moment in Madrid.Till that moment, Neuer remained impregnable under the bar. He remained the only reason the radioactive Vinicius Junior failed to get on the scoresheet. A back-to-back save to deny Real Madrid was the standout moment that enhanced Neuer's reputation of being the big game performer, the big brother of custodians, one who could slap a ball off an attacker's head inside his own box in a World Cup final and carry on as if it's just another day in office.Those who were fortunate enough to watch him at the Maracana would never forget a goalkeeper's supreme nonchalance.When he acrobatically palmed Vinicius' vicious punch over the bar, no one missed a beat because it was 'Manu the wall', as the Bayern fans have been fondly calling him for the last 13 seasons.""Manu did incredibly well but then made a mistake he wouldn't have made for 100 years,"" said Bayern coach Thomas Tuchel . ""It's frustrating. If there's anyone who didn't deserve that, it's Manu. We know who he is, what he's achieved.""At 38, Neuer made everyone believe in his stupendous shot-stopping ability and feline reflexes when his slightest touch defied Vinicius and when the ball bounced off the post, he was ready to deny Rodrygo. The reason Bayern could make the tie so close was Neuer and Neuer alone. Even legends do have a fall and Neuer relived the Kahn emotions and surely the senior felt the same.Wednesday's loss meant Neuer and Bayern will finish the season without a trophy for the first time since 2012.",Manuel Neuer's slip was reminiscent of Oliver Kahn's butterfingers in 2002 WC final.

Olympiakos secured their place in the Europa Conference League final by defeating Aston Villa 2-0 in the second leg of the semi-finals, marking a historic moment for the club. Led by Jose Luis Mendilibar, Olympiakos sealed a commanding 6-2 aggregate victory, largely thanks to Ayoub El Kaabi's brace, who had also scored a hat-trick in the first leg.The atmosphere at the Karaiskakis Stadium in Piraeus was electrifying as Olympiakos, boasting a record 47 Greek championships, earned their debut in a major European final.This achievement places them alongside Panathinaikos as the only Greek clubs to reach such heights, with Panathinaikos falling to Ajax in the 1971 European Cup final.The upcoming final against Fiorentina at the AEK Arena adds to the sense of destiny for Olympiakos, as it lies just 10 miles away from their home ground, further emphasizing the local rivalry.Despite Mendilibar's recent appointment in February, he has quickly become an iconic figure for Olympiakos, turning around their European fortunes after several disappointments in previous seasons.Under the ownership of Evangelos Marinakis, Olympiakos had struggled in Europe, failing to progress past the group stage 14 times out of 16 attempts. However, this season presents an opportunity for redemption, with Olympiakos aiming to secure their first European trophy in their nearly century-long history, a feat that would rival Greece's memorable Euro 2004 triumph.It has been a remarkable year for Olympiakos, highlighted by their Under-19 team's success in the UEFA Youth League final against AC Milan in April.On the other hand, Fiorentina booked their spot in the final by overcoming Club Brugge in the semi-finals, setting the stage for a thrilling showdown.Villa's departure marked a painful end to their quest for their first European final appearance since 1982. After returning to European competition following a 13-year hiatus, Villa now face the challenge of regrouping and redirecting their focus towards securing a top-four finish in the Premier League to qualify for the next season's Champions League.Under the guidance of Unai Emery, currently occupying fourth place in the league standings, Villa hold a seven-point lead over Tottenham, who sit in fifth place with three games remaining, compared to Villa's two.Early in the match, Olympiakos's Chiquinho had a chance on goal after bypassing Villa's defense, but his shot missed the target. However, Villa failed to take heed of this warning as Olympiakos capitalized on their defensive lapses to take the lead in the 10th minute.Despite Villa's attempts to find their rhythm, they struggled to coordinate their efforts, exemplified by Leon Bailey's slip as he attempted a shot that posed little threat to Olympiakos goalkeeper Kostas Tzolakis, who showcased his skill with a remarkable save to deny Bailey's powerful strike just before halftime.With Olympiakos firmly in control of the match, they pressed relentlessly and defended resolutely to keep Villa at bay.

Kylian Mbappe: Kylian Mbappe's final match for Paris Saint-Germain ends in Champions League semi-final defeat to Borussia Dortmund,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/champions-league/top-stories/kylian-mbappes-final-match-for-paris-saint-germain-ends-in-champions-league-semi-final-defeat-to-borussia-dortmund/articleshow/109933341.cms,"NEW DELHI: Kylian Mbappe 's dream of bidding farewell to Paris Saint-Germain by leading them to their first-ever Champions League title has been shattered following their unexpected semi-final defeat to Borussia Dortmund on Tuesday. The 2018 World Cup winner, who is set to leave PSG when his contract expires at the end of the season, likely to join Real Madrid , had hoped to sign off by guiding the club to European glory at Wembley next month.Despite PSG's status as favourites and their 31 attempts on goal, they failed to overturn a one-goal first-leg deficit, with Mats Hummels scoring the only goal of the night to secure a 2-0 aggregate victory for Dortmund. Mbappe, one of four PSG players to hit the woodwork in the second half, admitted that they needed to be more clinical in front of goal.""I don't really like to talk about bad luck. When you are good, you don't hit the post, you score. I tried to help the best I could. When I say we needed to be more clinical, I am the one who has to be scoring. But this is life, we need to pick ourselves up,"" Mbappe said after the loss.The defeat marks the closest Mbappe has come to lifting the European Cup with his hometown team, for whom he is their all-time top scorer with 255 goals, including 42 in the Champions League. The French sports daily L'Equipe described the result as ""the end of his dream"" and gave a scathing assessment of Mbappe's performance, rating him just two out of 10.PSG's elimination by a team sitting fifth in the Bundesliga is seen as a significant disappointment for a club that has invested heavily since the Qatari takeover in 2011. It is the latest in a series of Champions League knockout round failures, with their 6-1 defeat by Barcelona in 2017 still the most notable.Despite the presence of Mbappe, this PSG side was not seriously expected to reach this stage of the competition, having undergone a major overhaul following the departures of Lionel Messi and Neymar. Coach Luis Enrique, brought in to oversee the new project, acknowledged that his objective was to compete as well as possible for every trophy. Mbappe's final game for the club will now be the French Cup final against Lyon on May 25.The lack of experience at this level may have ultimately cost PSG, with their starting line-up having an average age of just 24 years and 157 days, the youngest for any team in a Champions League semi-final since Arsenal faced Manchester United in 2009. Captain Marquinhos emphasized the need to focus on the positives, saying, ""We need to remember that it is a new project with a new coach, with lots of changes. There are lots of positives and good things to take forward into next season.""However, it remains to be seen how PSG can improve their chances of winning the Champions League without Mbappe, even with the likely significant investment in a replacement.The coach's strategy of resting Mbappe or substituting him in domestic league games over the past three months, apparently in preparation for next season, has not ultimately helped PSG secure the trophy they most desire. As Mbappe, now 25, prepares to leave Paris, he will hope to finally get his hands on the Champions League trophy with his next club.",Kylian Mbappe is set to leave Paris Saint-Germain at the end of the season. PSG lost 2-0 on aggregate to Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League semi-final. The defeat is seen as a significant disappointment for the French club.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109934269,imgsize-61554,width-400,resizemode-4/109934269.jpg"
Parthib Gogoi a step away from achieving his dream,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/parthib-gogoi-a-step-away-from-achieving-his-dream/articleshow/109926682.cms,"KOLKATA: “Every young footballer dreams of playing for India,” was how Parthib Gogoi — named for the first time by Igor Stimac among the probables for the crucial World Cup qualifiers — put it when asked about his national team aspirations.“Playing for India is always a different kind of feeling. All of us have a lot of passion for playing in national colours.There is this feeling that we will give our lives to win the game for India. So that’s the feeling I get and get connected emotionally when representing India.”While the 21-year-old has chosen to stay low before the final squad selection, the Assam footballer is one of the new faces that head coach Stimac chose to give a shot ahead of India’s vital June fixtures in quest to progress to the third round of World Cup qualifiers. He will join NEUFC teammate and fellow first-time India probable Jithin MS for the four-week camp in Bhubaneswar set to begin this week.And if NEUFC’s only player to score in four consecutive games for his club makes it into Stimac’s final squad, it will be a milestone in Gogoi’s journey from his father’s football training centre in Assam’s Sivasagar to donning the jersey for the senior national team.“My idol is Sunil Chhetri . And if I get to share the dressing room with him, I can learn so much from him. If young players get a chance in the Indian squad, we can learn so much from the senior players. But it depends on the coach. If he picks me, I will give my best,” Parthib said during a freewheeling interaction with TOI.Parthib, along with Jithin this season, has been a bright spot in the Highlanders’ last two Indian Super League campaigns and has been getting better with time and experience. He had eight shots on target, of which three were goals, in 18 appearances in 2022-23 and continued the form at Durand Cup this year with his first hat-trick for NEUFC.Having extended his NEUFC contract till 2026-27, Parthib scored five goals for his team this ISL season while also providing two assists. But what captivated fans are three spectacular strikes from long range – against title winners Mumbai City, Chennaiyin and East Bengal.Parthib expressed his love for such piledrivers during the interaction. “That’s something I really love to do. Even while playing FIFA on Playstation, I always look for opportunities to shoot from distance,” he said.Having started his football journey as a two-year-old by following his brother Pragyan – also his teammate and “mental support” at NEUFC – to the field, Parthib has had the support of his entire family in his pursuit.“My father and his colleagues started a football training centre in 2005 that trains kids even today. My brother used to go there for training from 2005. My father, who was not a footballer but loves the game, used to carry me to the ground when I was two to watch my brother play and if I liked it, I could play it too. So that's how my football journey started in 2007. Also, papa used to get football clips on his phone, like those of Messi or Ronaldo, for us and watching these clips, I got attracted to the game,” Parthib said before adding with a laugh, “I have broken many doors in my house.”Having climbed through the ranks of Assam age-group teams, Bengaluru’s Ozone Football Academy and Indian Arrows, Parthib has also represented India at age-group competitions, the most recent being U23 AFC Cup Qualifiers in China followed by friendlies in Indonesia.But the bigger test begins for him this week as he looks to grab a place in Stimac’s scheme of things and add a goalscoring touch to the squad against Kuwait and Qatar.Asked about his future goal, the Messi fan and self-proclaimed “Barcelona boy” said, “I want to become one of the best footballers in India.”The dream bodes well for India, too, with the team in dire need of goal scorers as Chhetri approaches his twilight days with the team.",Parthib Gogoi named among probables for India's World Cup qualifiers. The 21-year-old is one of the new faces that head coach Igor Stimac chose to give a shot.

Premier League: Manchester United thumped 0-4 by Crystal Palace amid uncertainty over Erik ten Hag's future,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/epl/top-stories/premier-league-manchester-united-thumped-0-4-by-crystal-palace-amid-uncertainty-over-erik-ten-hags-future/articleshow/109901537.cms,"(Inputs from Reuters)

NEW DELHI: Michael Olise 's two goals propelled Crystal Palace to a resounding 4-0 triumph over Manchester United at Selhurst Park on Monday, marking the first time in their history that Palace have secured a league double over the Red Devils. The result will undoubtedly intensify the scrutiny on United manager Erik ten Hag .Palace's attack repeatedly exploited United's patchwork defence, which featured Casemiro playing out of position at centre-back.Jean-Philippe Mateta and Tyrick Mitchell also found the back of the net in the commanding victory.Despite the loss, United remain in eighth place with 54 points from 35 games, trailing sixth-placed Newcastle United by two points. Their chances of securing European football for the upcoming season are rapidly diminishing. Palace, on the other hand, sit in 14th place with 43 points from 36 matches.United's injury woes were compounded by the absence of Bruno Fernandes, who missed a match due to injury for the first time in his 230-game Old Trafford career. The ease with which they were defeated will be a significant concern for everyone associated with the club.This marks the first instance in the Premier League era that United have suffered 13 defeats in a single season, and the scoreline could have been even more lopsided.Under the guidance of new manager Oliver Glasner, Palace have found their rhythm, while United are stumbling towards the end of a season that cannot conclude soon enough for Ten Hag.","Crystal Palace defeated Manchester United 4-0 at Selhurst Park on Monday.

Rafael Nadal suffered a disappointing exit from the Rome Open on Saturday, bowing out in the second round with a 6-1, 6-3 loss to Poland's Hubert Hurkacz .This defeat to the seventh seed raises questions about whether the clay-court maestro will participate in the upcoming French Open, where he boasts a record 14 titles.Nadal has emphasized that his decision to compete at Roland Garros hinges on his sense of competitiveness, particularly given his recent string of injury setbacks.Currently ranked 305th in the world, Nadal remains cautious about committing to the prestigious tournament.And the manner of his elimination in his first ever encounter with 27-year-old Hurkacz was a step backwards after reaching the last 16 in Madrid.Nadal held his own in the first two games in the first set, which took 26 minutes to complete, but then fell away as errors handed Hurkacz points.The 37-year-old twice gave away breaks of serve with miscued drop shots in the first set which Hurkacz closed out in 49 minutes as he blew through five straight games.And the match was as good as done when Hurkacz, who did not drop a single service game, broke Nadal in the third game of the second set to set up a famous victory.That level of dominance over Nadal on clay, much less a court where he has won a record 10 titles, would have been unimaginable a few short years ago.But Hurkacz will face Tomas Etcheverry in the third round after likely ending Nadal's love affair with Rome as the 22-time Grand Slam winner looks set to call time on his career at the end of the season.","Rafael Nadal loses 6-1, 6-3 to Hubert Hurkacz in the second round of the Rome Open.

However, the 37-year-old has shown glimpses of his unparalleled skill and determination, notably with his record-breaking 10 titles in Rome, the most recent of which came in 2021.Against Bergs, Nadal faced a tough challenge from the 24-year-old qualifier, who has previously troubled top players like Stefanos Tsitsipas and last year's Rome finalist, Holger Rune.Despite Bergs' spirited performance and moments where victory seemed within his grasp, Nadal's tenacity ultimately secured him a hard-fought win, reaffirming his status as one of the greatest competitors in tennis history.",Rafael Nadal beats Zizou Bergs in three sets to reach second round of Rome Open.
