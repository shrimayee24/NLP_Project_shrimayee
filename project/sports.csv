GEORGETOWN: In most parts of the West Indies, the old-fashioned way of walking down the runway to the plane still prevails. It's fun on most days, but at night with the rain lashing down, the walk to take the flight, or to deplane, can get a little tricky.On Tuesday night, a small flight of about 80 people, consisting mostly of people related to the T20 World Cup, landed in Georgetown and were greeted by persistent showers.As the passengers all dashed for the shade, one could see the tall figure of Australian umpire Rod Tucker running alongside. When somebody asked Tucker whether he would be officiating the game, he laughed: ""Well, yes, if it happens"".""If it happens."" That's the operative word on everybody's lips as India get ready to play England in Rohan Kanhai land on Thursday.It's been raining for the last couple of days in Guyana and it didn't stop through the morning on Wednesday. What the locals are hoping is that if it rains on one day, it doesn't on the other. But then, that's clutching at straws, especially when the forecast is as bad as it is for Thursday.Probably the only ones who don't care are the Indian fans who have tickets for the final in Barbados on Saturday but couldn't manage one for the semifinal here. India will make the final if it's a washout because they topped their Super 8 group.The ICC has extended the cut-off time for calling the game off by four hours than what it was earlier, but for all that to happen, the rain has to stop first. ""This is rain time in Guyana, why did they even schedule the game here? That too without a reserve day,"" mused a local in anguish.But the guys who will benefit the most if it keeps raining - the Indian team - are the ones who don't want it to happen this way. The sun came out here after the morning showers on match eve and after India completed a practice session at the quick drying Providence Stadium , captain Rohit Sharma said: ""We are not looking at a curtailed game. When we come tomorrow, we will hope that it is a full game, but if it is so, we will adapt.""This game has a lot riding on emotionally as well for the Indian team because it is their chance to get revenge on a team that had humiliated them in the 2022 T20 World Cup semis. Though the return of Jasprit Bumrah , who missed that World Cup with an injury, has been the single most important change that has happened since then, Rohit insists ""not much has changed"".""We have thought and discussed and thrashed out numerous times what needs to be done. It's about keeping it going,"" the skipper said.Bumrah apart, it's Kuldeep Yadav who has been another superb inclusion once India landed in the West Indies. His quality and guile have been difficult to deal with for most opponents and England shouldn't be any exception.The defending champions, though, have a bit of firepower with the likes of Jos Buttler , Phil Salt and the rest finding some form. They have three spinners - Moeen Ali, Adil Rashid and Liam Livingstone - who can make use of spin-friendly conditions in Guyana, but the biggest England supporter would say that a curtailed game would be their best chance.Man to man, on current form, India are much superior, but if it's a shorter game, many of those things go out of the window. It becomes a bit of a shootout and with rain in the air and Messrs Duckworth, Lewis and Stern calling the shots, the toss, too becomes important.India know that they may have to deal with these variables, because that's the nature of the beast these days if it's a 365-day cricket season. Rohit and Co. will believe they are good enough for whatever comes in their way as they look to break their ICC silverware drought.It will be cloudy in Guyana on Thursday with 75% probability of rain. While forecast for match hours are slightly better, if it rains heavily before the starts, it can have an impact. With an inefficient stadium drainage system, many hours could be lost.There is no reserve day for this game. However, play can extend to 4 hours and 10 minutes to complete the game. India advance in case of a washout.Providence Stadium is a spinner's haven with low, sharp turn on offer. Spinners have conceded less than 7 runs per over here in recent times, good news for India's spin troika - Kuldeep, Axar and Jadeja. England too boast of Moeen Ali, Adil Rashid and Liam Livingstone in their ranks for this day game.In the previous WC game here, West Indies struggled to chase down PNG's 137, with the variable bounce raising eyebrows. Don't expect the ball to come on to the bat and expect the surface to play a few tricks.This is precisely what India didn't do in Adelaide last time around. If Rohit Sharma can reprise his heroics against Australia, India will be home free.On paper, England have more six-hitters in the lineup but India's middle order enforcers like Suryakumar Yadav , Rishabh Pant and Shivam Dube will worry the England attack.India have been traditionally shaky in knockout rounds. But the current England white-ball dispensation too is under pressure after the failure to defend the ODI World Cup last year.",India face England in T20 World Cup semifinal in Guyana on Thursday. Rain forecast for Guyana with 75% probability of rain. ICC has extended the cut-off time for calling the game off by four hours. India will make the final if it's a washout because they topped their Super 8 group.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111302417,imgsize-55884,width-400,resizemode-4/111302417.jpg"

NEW DELHI: India dominated South Africa to end their long global trophy drought, winning the 2024 T20 World Cup title. It was India’s second title in the tournament as they joined the West Indies and England as the multiple time T20 World Cup champions.The rich history of India’s global triumphs in both ODI and T20 formats stands as a testament to their enduring legacy in the sport.From the historic win in 1983 to the thrilling triumphs in 2007, 2011 and 2024, each title has contributed to the rich legacy of Indian cricket.India’s first major breakthrough in world cricket came in 1983 when Kapil Dev led the team to an unexpected and historic victory in the ODI World Cup held in England. Defying all odds, India defeated the mighty West Indies in the final at Lord’s. Kapil Dev’s leadership, along with memorable performances from Mohinder Amarnath, and the all-round efforts of the team, played a crucial role in this triumph. This victory marked the beginning of India’s rise as a cricketing powerhouse.In the 2002 ICC Champions Trophy held in Sri Lanka, India emerged as joint winners alongside Sri Lanka after rain disrupted both the initial final and the subsequent reserve day. Led by Sourav Ganguly, India showcased a strong performance throughout the tournament, highlighted by exceptional batting displays from Virender Sehwag and Rahul Dravid, and crucial contributions from their bowlers. The final saw India in a competitive position before rain intervened, preventing the completion of the match.The 2007 T20 World Cup in South Africa saw India clinch the title in the inaugural edition of the tournament. Under the dynamic leadership of MS Dhoni , a young Indian team, filled with fresh talent and fearless approach, won the hearts of fans worldwide.

Key performances from players like Yuvraj Singh, Gautam Gambhir, and the remarkable bowling by Joginder Sharma in the final over were instrumental in securing this historic win.The 2011 ODI World Cup, co-hosted by India, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh, saw India lift the trophy for the second time.

to be fairer

GEORGETOWN: The wait kept getting longer. The world's eyes were on the weather radar and as the clouds seemed to keep moving away, the smiles were back on the faces of the fans who have been trooping into Guyana from across the United States and other parts of the world. The toss got delayed, the super-soppers were on, but nothing mattered more than the hot sun that was burning in full glory after morning showers.But as the teams got on to the field and started to prepare themselves for a long day, quite a few questions about how the tournament has been scheduled surfaced.To start with, there is no reserve day between games in the knock-out stage, which is beyond belief for anybody who is associated with cricket in this part of the world. To compensate for that, the rule of the tournament was amended at the 11th hour, with two days to go for the match, allowing four hours of extra time.Pakistan, who had been knocked out in Lauderdale because their game could not be started despite a hot sun blazing through the day, are justified to ask a few questions after rules got amended before the semis.While that's one issue, the fact that India knew way before the World Cup started that their semifinal would be played in Guyana has also come up for discussion. India captain Rohit Sharma tried to shut it down saying that ""it's the same for all teams"" and that ""England have enough experience of playing in these conditions"", the theory that India got a bit of unfair advantage cannot be disputed.Former England captain Michael Vaughan didn't mince his words when he said that the T20 World Cup is ""purely set up for India"" and ICC should have been a bit more ""fairer"" to other countries because this is not a bilateral event.""Well, it's their tournament isn't it? Literally it's that. You know that. They get to play whenever they want, they know where their semifinal is, they play every single game in the morning so people can watch them at night, obviously in India on TV,"" Vaughan said during a podcast with Australian great Adam Gilchrist on the YouTube channel Club Prairie Fire.The Ashes-winning captain feels it is purely the financial might of Indian cricket that has led to such a situation. ""I get that money is a big play, and I get that in bilateral series but when you get to a World Cup, the ICC should be a little bit fairer to everybody. There can't be sympathy or any kind of sway towards one team and this tournament is purely set up for India,"" Vaughan said.","Former England captain Michael Vaughan says T20 World Cup is ""purely set up for India"" ICC should have been a bit more ""fairer"" to other countries because this is not a bilateral event, says Vaughan.

Inzamam-ul-Haq had stirred a bit of a controversey when he questioned how India, in particular left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh, managed to reverse-swing the ball in the 16th over of Australia's innings during their 'Super 8's match of the T20 World Cup , and the former Pakistan captain has retorted once again asking India skipper Rohit Sharma to not try to teach him how and when the ball reverse-swings.Replying to a reporter's question about Inzamam's allegations, Rohit rubbished the claims, saying: ""What should I say now about this? You are playing in such hot sun, the wicket is so dry, the ball reverses automatically. It's happening for all the teams, not only ours. All the teams are reverse-swinging. Sometimes, it's important to open your mind.""It's important to understand what conditions you're playing in.

'Six months ago he was not even MI captain': Sourav Ganguly backs Rohit Sharma to end India's ICC trophy drought,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-mens-t20-world-cup/six-months-ago-he-was-not-even-mi-captain-sourav-ganguly-backs-rohit-sharma-to-end-indias-icc-trophy-drought/articleshow/111344625.cms,"India a dominant force by its performance

NEW DELHI: Former Indian skipper Sourav Ganguly praised Rohit Sharma 's captaincy skills on Friday, attributing them to India's undefeated streak in the current T20 World Cup . He encouraged the team to approach the final against South Africa with an unrestrained mindset, aiming to conclude an 11-year drought without an ICC title.The highly anticipated championship match between India and South Africa will take place in Bridgetown, Barbados.The Indian team is determined to secure their first international trophy since their triumphant campaign in the 2013 Champions Trophy.""I'm very happy for Rohit Sharma. Life comes full circle. Six months ago he was not even the captain of Mumbai Indians and the same man is now leading India to a World Cup final, unbeaten,"" Ganguly said, as quoted by PTI, after being roped in as the brand ambassador of Veedol.The former BCCI president Ganguly disclosed that Rohit was hesitant to assume the captaincy responsibilities following Virat Kohli's decision to step down from the leadership role.""He has played two World Cup finals where he has gone into the final unbeaten. That speaks of his captaincy and leadership quality and I'm not surprised because he became captain when I was the BCCI president and when Virat didn't want to captain India anymore.""It took a lot of time to make him captain because he was not ready to captain. It took a lot of pushing from all of us to make him captain and I'm very happy to see the progress of Indian cricket under him.""Ganguly expressed that securing victories in the Indian Premier League (IPL) can occasionally be a more demanding task due to the extended length of the competition.""Rohit has the record of winning five IPL titles, which is a huge achievement. Winning an IPL sometimes is more difficult. Don't misquote me, I'm not saying IPL is better than international cricket.""But you have to win 16-17 (12-13) matches to win an IPL; here you need to win 8-9 matches to win a World Cup. The honour is more in winning the World Cup, and I hope Rohit does it tomorrow.""""I don't think he can lose two World Cup finals in seven (six) months. He will probably jump into the Barbados ocean if he loses two finals under his captaincy in seven months. He has led from the front, batted brilliantly, and I hope it continues tomorrow. Hope India finishes on the right side, and they should play with freedom.""They have been the best side of the competition. I wish them luck, I wish they win. Hope they have a little bit of luck tomorrow because that is required to win big tournaments,"" Ganguly added.India's journey since their triumphant Champions Trophy campaign has been marked by a series of near misses in major tournaments. They fought their way to the final of the 2014 T20 World Cup, showcasing their prowess in the shortest format of the game. However, they fell short at the final hurdle, unable to clinch the coveted title.""I look at it differently. At least we are getting to the finals, we can only win once we get to the final,"" he said.""The positive thing is India is not getting eliminated. Secondly, they are dominating. You saw the World Cup in India seven months ago; they were the best side in the competition, although they lost to Australia in the final.""They were a better side than Australia right through the tournament; they just had one bad day,"" he pointed out.Ganguly expressed his views on South Africa's historic achievement of reaching the World Cup final for the first time since their reintegration into international cricket in 1991.""It's a huge moment for South African cricket. Imagine a team that came back to international cricket in 1992, and it took them 32 years to play in a World Cup final. So, it's going to be a big day for both teams,"" he said.Kohli has been experiencing a relatively average performance in the current World Cup while opening the batting order. However, Ganguly believes that Kohli should maintain his position and not shift to the No. 3 spot in the lineup.""Virat should continue to open. He just had a World Cup of 700 runs seven months ago. He is human. Sometimes, he will also fail, and you have to accept it.""People like Kohli, (Sachin) Tendulkar, (Rahul) Dravid, they are institutions for Indian cricket. Three-four matches don't make them weaker players. Don't rule him out in the final tomorrow,"" added Ganguly.Former England captain Michael Vaughan has expressed disapproval of the ICC. He alleges that the governing body has given India an advantage by selecting a venue for the World Cup semifinal in Guyana that is conducive to spin bowling.Furthermore, Vaughan has leveled accusations against broadcasters, claiming that they have consistently allocated India the desirable 8pm IST time slot for all of their matches in the tournament.Dismissing such claims, Ganguly said: ""Michael Vaughan is a very dear friend of mine. I don't know how ICC helps India win cricket matches by keeping the broadcast at 8 pm IST in the evening. I don't know how broadcasting wins you cricket matches. You still have to play in the middle and win.""""Secondly, I don't know why Guyana is thought to be a venue for winning when they have gone around and won everywhere.""Ganguly emphasized his stance, asserting that India's unwavering performance in matches has established them as a formidable power in the sport.""Yes, India are a dominant force in world cricket, by its performance, by its broadcast, and by the money it brings to the table.""You know if you own 80 percent of a company's shares, you will get more dividends and profits than others. It's the rule of life. India are the same,"" he said.",Sourav Ganguly praises Rohit Sharma's captaincy skills. India aiming to end 11-year drought without an ICC title.

Literally it's that. You know that.

Giving away just 4 runs in it, Bumrah kept India's hopes alive and that's where South Africa's choking in the chase began.Although the win predictor still showed 92% Proteas win and India's chances at only 8% after 16 overs, the reality on the ground looked different.The equation was now 26 off 24 as Hardik Pandya came back into the attack to bowl the 17th over.Dismissing a fifty-up Heinrich Klaasen on the first ball of the over, Hardik broke the backbone of the Proteas chase.As a potentially match winning knock from Klaasen ended via a caught behind dismissal, India were now right back in the contest.In the 17th over, Hardik gave just 4 runs apart from the Klaasen wicket as South Africa now needed 22 off 18.For Rohit now, it was a tough choice, whether to give Bumrah the 18th or the 19th over and the skipper went with the former.After a couple of dot balls and a single, Bumrah knocked over Marco Jansen (2) on the fourth ball as David Miller, at the non-striker's end helplessly watched the Proteas implosion.With just two runs and a wicket coming in the 18th Bumrah over, the pressure was now all on South Africa.Left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh then came in and delivered an incredible penultimate over, giving away just 4 runs to David Miller (21*) and Keshav Maharaj (2*).The four exceptional overs after the 16th had now given Hardik 16 to defend in the final over.On the first ball of the final Hardik over, Surykumar Yadav, at long-off pulled off the catch for the ages to get rid of Miller for 21 as India delivered the knockout punch to the Proteas.With Maharaj and Kagiso Rabada now in the middle and 16 to defend off 5 balls, Hardik finished off the job with perfection as India sealed a famous seven-run win.",India beat South Africa by seven runs at the T20 World Cup in Barbados.

NEW DELHI: India's victory in the T20 World Cup final against South Africa was the culmination of a three-year journey filled with meticulous planning and diligent preparation, rather than a singular display of flawless execution on the day of the championship match, according to an emotionally charged Rohit Sharma , the team's captain.In a closely contested final, India managed to secure a seven-run win over South Africa, bringing an end to a title drought that had lasted for more than a decade.""I am completely lost and can't say what kind of emotions I am going through. Can't explain it in words. Let this sink in. Last night, I couldn't sleep as I was desperate and wanted it so badly. But I managed myself well inside the ground,"" Rohit, as quoted by PTI, said after becoming the third India captain after Kapil Dev and Mahendra Singh Dhoni to clinch a global title.""Hard to sum up what we've been through in last three-four years. A lot behind the scenes, not what we did today, it's what we did before,"" said the skipper.Rohit, still haunted by the memories of the ODI World Cup loss from the previous year, understood the importance of absorbing pressure in high-stakes situations.""A lot of high-pressure games, and we've been on the wrong side of it. Guys understand when the pressure is on, what needs to be done, today was perfect example, we stuck together with backs to the wall.""Rohit made sure to acknowledge the crucial role played by the team management and his teammates in answering his call for action.""We wanted this really bad, a lot of minds need to come together, very proud of the bunch of boys and the management, giving us the liberty to play and that trust. Starts from management, coach, captain, and the players.""Rohit, who has shared the cricket field with Virat Kohli for over a decade and a half, remained unfazed by his teammate's lean patch leading up to the crucial match. The Indian captain had unwavering faith in Kohli's abilities, despite the recent struggles with the bat.""No-one was in doubt about the form of Virat, on top of his game for last 15 years. Come the occasion, big players stand up. Crucial to hold that end, for the others to play around him.""...it wasn't a wicket to bat freely. He did that perfectly, that experience of all the years come together, and Axar's batting was crucial,"" he said, lauding the 47-run effort by Patel.Jasprit Bumrah's exceptional abilities on the cricket field are challenging to articulate for the average person. Even the team captain admits that he struggles to adequately capture the essence of Bumrah's bowling prowess.""Jasprit, I understand you guys trying to put it into words, but I don't know how he does it, it's just masterclass. He backs his skills which is more than enough, and is a confident lad. Class act,"" Rohit said about the player of the tournament.Following a challenging IPL season with the Mumbai Indians, Hardik Pandya showcased his skills during the T20 World Cup. His impressive performance did not go unnoticed by the national team captain, who praised Pandya's efforts.""Hardik was brilliant, to bowl that last over, proud of the boys. And the fans, from New York to Barbados, and back home. Late in India but they've been waiting a long time.

The result helped Brazil bounce back strongly from a disappointing opening performance.Vinicius, who had a subdued outing in the previous game, was a constant menace down the left flank throughout the match.His movement and trickery caused significant problems for the Paraguayan defence.His first goal, arriving in the 35th minute, exemplified Brazil's fluid attacking play. A well-worked team move culminated in Lucas Paqueta delivering a precise first-time pass to Vinicius, who calmly slotted the ball home.Brazil doubled their lead shortly after through Girona winger Savio, who reacted quickest to a rebound inside the penalty area. Vinicius then added his second and Brazil's third just before half-time, capitalizing on a defensive error by Omar Alderete .The Paraguayan defender's attempted clearance struck Vinicius's outstretched leg and deflected into the net.Paraguay showed resilience early in the second half, pulling a goal back through a spectacular long-range strike from Alderete. However, any hopes of an unlikely comeback were dashed when Lucas Paqueta atoned for an earlier penalty miss by converting a spot-kick in the 68th minute.This victory leads Brazil to second place in Group D with four points from two matches. Colombia currently lead the group with a perfect record of two wins from two, securing their place in the quarter-finals. Costa Rica, on the other hand, occupy the third spot with one point, while Paraguay sit at the bottom of the table with two losses.","Brazil beat Paraguay 4-1 in their second Group D match of the Copa America.

On the other hand, Gareca was late in bringing on a player at halftime during Chile's match against Argentina on Tuesday.CONMEBOL cited articles 104 and 145 of the tournament's regulations, which stipulate that teams must take the field on time for the scheduled start or restart of play. Failure to do so has resulted in the one-match suspension for both Scaloni and Gareca, preventing them from being present on the substitutes' bench during their respective teams' final group stage matches on Saturday.In addition to the suspensions, the Argentine and Chilean football federations have each been fined $15,000 as a consequence of their teams' tardiness.As things stand, Argentina currently top Group A with six points and have already secured their place in the quarter-finals. They will face Peru on Saturday without the presence of Scaloni on the sidelines.Meanwhile, Chile, with only one point, will take on group runners-up Canada in their final group match, also without the guidance of Gareca from the bench.While the suspensions and fines may seem harsh, they serve as a reminder to teams and coaching staff of the need to respect the established rules and schedules, ensuring the smooth and timely progression of the competition.","The South American football governing body, CONMEBOL, has taken disciplinary action against the coaches of Argentina and Chile, Lionel Scaloni and Ricardo Gareca.

The goals from Luis Diaz , Davinson Sanchez , and Jhon Cordoba ensured that Colombia finished in the top two positions in Group D.With this win, Colombia extended their unbeaten streak to 25 games, a remarkable achievement that dates back to February 2022 when they suffered a defeat against Argentina.Nestor Lorenzo's well-drilled side displayed a composed and organized performance, never allowing Costa Rica to threaten their unbeaten record.The opening goal came in the 31st minute when Liverpool's Luis Diaz converted a penalty kick with authority after Costa Rican goalkeeper Patrick Sequeira committed a reckless challenge on Jhon Cordoba near the edge of the penalty area. Diaz's powerful strike found the top corner, giving Colombia the lead.Colombia came close to doubling their advantage in the 37th minute when veteran midfielder James Rodriguez picked out Diaz at the back post with a precise cross. However, Diaz's attempted cutback across the face of the goal narrowly evaded the outstretched Davinson Sanchez.Sanchez made amends for the missed opportunity in the 59th minute, glancing in Jhon Arias's left-wing cross to extend Colombia's lead to 2-0. Three minutes later, Cordoba scored the third goal with a clinical finish, latching onto Rodriguez's incisive through ball and firing a low shot across the goalkeeper and into the far corner.With this comprehensive victory, Colombia will qualify for the quarter-finals as group winners if they can secure at least a point against Brazil in their final group game on Tuesday.
