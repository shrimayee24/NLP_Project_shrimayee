SRH management threatened to relocate if such practices continue. IPS officer K Sreenivasa Reddy will conduct the inquiry. A recent incident involved HCA representatives locking a box on SRH's match day until extra tickets were provided.

HYDERABAD: Following media reports about the Hyderabad Cricket Association (HCA) president and some other top officials harassing and blackmailing the IPL franchise Sunrisers Hyderabad over free tickets, Telangana chief minister A Revanth Reddy, on Monday, ordered an investigation into the matter.The state government appointed senior IPS officer Kothakota Sreenivasa Reddy , currently serving as director general (vigilance & enforcement) to conduct an investigation in the case and submit a report soon.Recently, the SRH management took strong objection to HCA president A Jagan Mohan Rao’s conduct and shot an email, threatening to stop playing matches in Hyderabad’s Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket stadium if they continue to harass them with demands for free tickets.“All these unprofessional threats and actions by HCA, especially by the HCA president, make it evident that you don’t want Sunrisers to play at your stadium. If that is the case, please let me know in writing so that we can inform the BCCI, the Telangana govt, and our management that you wish for us to move to another venue, and we will move,” Sunrisers’ general manager Srinath TB told HCA in an email.Reacting to this development, the state government took cognizance and ordered an enquiry to end the culture of franchises demanding free tickets.""The chief minister has appointed Sreenivasa Reddy to enquiry into the allegations. He has also issued instructions to esnure that no one harasses the SRH management for passes no matter who they are. It could be officers in uniform or anyone else for that matter, this practice should end,’’ a source in the secretariat told TOI.What triggered the row was HCA representatives locking up a box on the day of the SRH-LSG match on Thursday. “Please note that we pay the appropriate rent for the stadium, and during the tenure of the IPL, the stadium is under our jurisdiction. But in the last game, you locked the F3 box, refusing to open it unless 20 extra free tickets were given to you. This unprofessional behaviour creates a hostile environment, making cooperation increasingly difficult,” he stated.",Telangana chief minister A Revanth Reddy ordered an investigation into the matter. IPS officer K Sreenivasa Reddy will conduct the inquiry.

Sir Lewis Hamilton wants to design Ferrari F44 car



Lewis Hamilton ’s illustrious Formula 1 career has been defined by innovation and ambition, and his latest dream is no exception. As he embarks on his new journey with Ferrari, the seven-time world champion has set his sights on designing his own supercar—an endeavor that could redefine automotive excellence. Hamilton has expressed his desire to create the ‘F44,’ a machine deeply inspired by the legendary Ferrari F40, regarded as one of the most iconic supercars of all time.Lewis Hamilton’s transition to Ferrari ahead of the 2025 season has been a rollercoaster ride. His debut at the Australian Grand Prix resulted in a distant 10th-place finish, a less-than-ideal start for the decorated driver. However, he bounced back in dramatic fashion at the Chinese Grand Prix, securing a thrilling sprint race victory—only his third win of any kind since 2022. Yet, the excitement was short-lived, as both he and teammate Charles Leclerc were disqualified from the main event in Shanghai for separate infractions. While Leclerc’s car was deemed underweight, Hamilton’s exclusion stemmed from excessive skid-block wear, an issue he had previously faced at the 2023 United States Grand Prix.Despite these setbacks on the track, Hamilton’s presence has already made waves commercially. Ferrari’s partnership with Puma has seen an eightfold increase in merchandise sales since his arrival, proving that his influence extends far beyond race-day performances.Hamilton’s passion for cars extends beyond Formula 1, and his ambition to design the F44 reflects his deep appreciation for Ferrari’s heritage. “One of the things I really want to do is design a Ferrari. I want to design an F44,” he revealed at a recent fan event. Inspired by the F40, the project would incorporate a traditional stick shift—a nostalgic yet bold move in an era dominated by paddle-shift transmissions.Ferrari’s special projects team is known for accommodating unique requests, and Hamilton’s vision could very well become a reality. If successful, the F44 could bridge the gap between Ferrari’s storied past and its future, solidifying Hamilton’s legacy both on and off the track.However, his fans for now wants him to focus soley on winning this season with Ferrari.All eyes will be on Hamilton as he shifts the gear at the Japanese Grand Prix on April 6th.Also Read: Lewis Hamilton fuels Hollywood dreams as he and Charles Leclerc drop a major hint about an upcoming movie collaboration","Sir Lewis Hamilton wants to design Ferrari F44 car.

Philadelphia Flyers begin extensive search for new head coach following John Tortorella's departure,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/philadelphia-flyers-begin-extensive-search-for-new-head-coach-following-john-tortorellas-departure/articleshow/119787595.cms,"Image via Getty Images

Flyers’ top candidates for head coach

With John Tortorella no longer at the helm of the Philadelphia Flyers, the team is in search of a new head coach to lead them forward. While Brad Shaw has been appointed as the interim coach for the remainder of the season, the organization will likely conduct an extensive search for a permanent replacement. Several candidates have emerged as potential fits for the role, each bringing unique strengths to the table.The Flyers are searching for a new head coach, with candidates including David Carle, Rick Tocchet, Mike Sullivan, Jay Woodcroft, and Marc Savard. GM Daniel Brière must choose between experience and fresh leadership.One strong contender is David Carle, the head coach of the University of Denver. At just 35 years old, Carle has already achieved remarkable success, leading his team to NCAA championships in 2022 and 2024. He also coached Team USA to back-to-back gold medals in the World Junior Championships in 2024 and 2025. His ability to develop young players makes him an appealing option for the Flyers, who are in a rebuilding phase. Additionally, his brother, Matt Carle, played for the Flyers, giving him a personal connection to the organization.Another option is Rick Tocchet, a Flyers legend who played 621 games for the team and later transitioned into coaching. Currently leading the Vancouver Canucks, Tocchet has previous experience as head coach of the Tampa Bay Lightning and Arizona Coyotes. Reports suggest that Vancouver wants to extend his contract, but his deep ties to Philadelphia and coaching style could make him a strong candidate if he becomes available.A more experienced candidate is Mike Sullivan, who led the Pittsburgh Penguins to back-to-back Stanley Cup victories in 2016 and 2017. With the Penguins potentially missing the playoffs for a third straight year, there is speculation that a coaching change could happen. If Sullivan becomes available, his championship experience and ability to manage high-pressure situations would make him a major asset for the Flyers.Another potential candidate is Jay Woodcroft, the current head coach of the Edmonton Oilers. Woodcroft has been praised for his ability to develop offensive strategies and get the best out of young players. His coaching philosophy aligns with the Flyers' long-term plans, making him a strong option if Edmonton decides to part ways with him.Lastly, Marc Savard is another name to watch. As an assistant coach with the St. Louis Blues, he has been instrumental in developing their power-play systems and offensive structure. His expertise in creating effective offensive strategies could be valuable for a Flyers team looking to improve their scoring efficiency.Also Read: Wayne Gretzky once predicted Alex Ovechkin could break his all-time NHL goal record, and it's closer than ever With general manager Daniel Brière leading the coaching search, the Flyers will likely consider multiple options before making a final decision. Whether they choose a veteran coach with NHL experience or a younger coach with a fresh approach, the decision will be crucial in shaping the team's future.","The Philadelphia Flyers are searching for a new head coach.

What happened between Anthony Edwards and Kevin Durant that sent Minnesota Timberwolves star to the locker room?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/what-happened-between-anthony-edwards-and-kevin-durant-that-sent-minnesota-timberwolves-star-to-the-locker-room/articleshow/119688788.cms,"Anthony Edwards and Kevin Durant.

Anthony Edwards received a hard elbow from Kevin Durant



The Minnesota Timberwolves faced a moment of uncertainty on Friday night when star guard Anthony Edwards went down after a collision with Phoenix Suns forward Kevin Durant . Edwards had to be escorted to the locker room after taking a hit to the face during the first quarter. The Ant-Man returned to the court, but the hard blow on his nose was a serious concern for the Timberwolves and their fans at the moment.When 2:43 was left in the first quarter, Anthony Edwards attempted to intercept a pass intended for Kevin Durant, but in the process, Durant’s arm caught him across the nose. The impact sent Edwards to the ground in visible pain, where he remained for a minute before walking off with assistance. The incident initially sparked concerns about a possible serious injury, as Edwards had a towel covering his face while heading to the locker room.Dane Moore of Blue Wire described the incident, stating, “Anthony Edwards headed to the locker room with a towel over his face after a collision with Kevin Durant. Looked like he maybe got poked in the eye or something.” Similarly, Duane Rankin of azcentral reported, “Anthony Edwards went down as he and Kevin Durant were going for the ball.”Edwards’ absence in the second quarter raised alarms for Timberwolves fans, considering his exceptional season, where he has averaged 27.3 points, 5.7 rebounds, and 4.6 assists per game on 44.1% shooting. With Minnesota sitting in eighth place and just a half-game behind the Los Angeles Clippers for the final guaranteed playoff spot, every game is crucial.Despite the injury scare, Edwards returned in the second half and finished the game with 20 points, helping the Timberwolves secure a 124-109 victory over the Suns. The win marked a four-game season sweep for Minnesota over Phoenix and extended their winning streak against the Suns to seven games. Edwards is currently averaging 23.7 points per game.Also Read: Stephen Curry returns to lead Golden State Warriors to victory over New Orleans Pelican Julius Randle led the Timberwolves with 25 points, while Collin Gillespie stepped up with a career-high 22 points and nine assists.

Phoenix also continued to struggle without Bradley Beal, who missed his sixth consecutive game due to a left hamstring injury.","Minnesota Timberwolves guard Anthony Edwards went down after a collision with Phoenix Suns forward Kevin Durant.

President Donald Trump is all set to welcome the Kansas City Chiefs to the White House



Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce continue to be one of the most popular couples in the NFL. While the recent events at Super Bowl 2025 might have made them lowkey, they are still very much in love with one another. But it seems like things might change between Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift due to newly elected President Donald Trump since the Kansas City Chiefs have now been invited to the White House.While the Chiefs have not issued a statement about it yet, President Donald Trump had once predicted Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s break up.In 2023, in an interview with the Daily Caller, President Donald Trump was asked about Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s relationship. President Donald Trump had said, “I wish the best for both of them. I hope they enjoy their life, maybe together, maybe not — most likely not.”Two years later, while Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce have continued to be together, President Donald Trump’s feud with Swift has also continued and gotten worse.The billionaire pop star Taylor Swift has publicly spoken about not supporting Donald Trump.

And one other thing, we’re going to have the Kansas City Chiefs after that, because they missed their turn because of Covid.”While it is not known how Taylor Swift will react to accepting her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, visiting the White House when she has been trolled multiple times by President Donald Trump, it remains interesting to see how it changes the couple’s equation or if it will even have an effect on them.Currently, fans are waiting for Taylor Swift to announce the date for the release of her new album while Travis Kelce has not yet confirmed if he would be retiring this season.

Montana emerges as the perfect retreat for Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift

Kansas City Chiefs ’ star tight end Travis Kelce and global pop icon Taylor Swift are taking steps toward their future together, with recent reports suggesting that Montana could be their ideal destination to settle down. While some speculated that Kelce might have retired had the Chiefs won the Super Bowl, it appears the couple is moving forward with their life plans regardless of his football career status.Kelce and Swift have reportedly fallen in love with Montana’s serene, media-free environment, making it an attractive option for their future home. A source speaking with RadarOnline.com revealed, “It’s their happy place. They could see themselves building a life there someday. It’s the one place they truly feel free.”This revelation follows reports that the couple was initially eyeing real estate in Kansas City. However, after a visit to the Auric Room at Lone Mountain Ranch, Montana has seemingly become their preferred choice for a peaceful and private retreat.While Kelce remains a key player for the Chiefs, speculation about his retirement has been ongoing. Some insiders believe that if Kansas City had secured the Super Bowl victory, Kelce might have stepped away from the game to focus on his personal life with Swift. However, since that didn’t happen, his football career will continue for at least another season.Despite that, Kelce and Swift are not waiting for his retirement to make future plans. They are actively considering Montana as the place where they will begin the next chapter of their relationship. The state’s peaceful ambiance and lack of constant media attention make it the perfect escape from the public eye.Kelce’s growing interests outside of football, such as podcasting and potential acting roles, make the possibility of his retirement even more intriguing.

"Brady Tkachuk, Tim Stutzle, and Ridly Greig struggle as the Ottawa Senators fall to the Pittsburgh Penguins",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/senators-captain-brady-tkachuk-and-stars-struggle-in-heartbreaking-1-0-loss-to-penguins/articleshow/119807300.cms,"Image Via IG

Brady Tkachuk Falls short in a must-win game

Tim Stutzle’s offensive struggles continue

Ridley Greig’s costly penalty proves to be the turning point

The Senators of Ottawa endured a night of torment as a 1-0 scoreline was knocked down by the Pittsburgh Penguins . They had all scoring chances, and the contribution of Anton Forsberg was a stunning goaltending performance with 34 stops in net, but the Senators could not find a way to break through Tristan Jarry's 31 shots. Sidney Crosby's power-play goal early in the third period sealed Ottawa's fate. While for some players, there was contribution, for others, it was a denial of any impact, and that further hampered the disappointment of the loss the teamsuffered.As captain and the heart and soul of the team, if the team needed their leader to step up in a clutch moment, this was it. But he couldn't deliver. While Tkachuk threw some hits and had three shots on goal, his real contribution in the offensive department was minimal.Tkachuk is often a difference-maker, yet, in this case, he was unable to conjure the positive energy Ottawa so desperately needed. If the Senators fight for the playoff spot, Tkachuk has to step up and be a leader.When Tim Stutzle is on his game, Ottawa's offense looks threatening. Unfortunately, that was not the case against Pittsburgh. Stutzle played almost 19 minutes but did not have a single shot on goal. With the opponents exploiting Stutzle's lack of offensive involvement, the Penguins were in total control of the match.Stutzle is vital to the creative flow and scoring chance production of the Senators. If he keeps having silent nights like that one, things are only going to get worse in an already-struggling offensive environment.Out of all the mistakes Ottawa made, Ridly Greig's penalty near the end of the contest had to be the most damaging.

Andrew Krakouer's life is full of talent, redemption, and legacy



Life beyond Football: A mentor and advocate



Andrew Krakouer passed awy leaving a lasting legacy



The Australian football community is mourning the tragic loss of former AFL star Andrew Krakouer , who passed away at the age of 42 due to a suspected heart attack at his family home in Perth. Krakouer, remembered as a ""trailblazer"" and ""just a ripper person,"" left behind a legacy that transcended his achievements on the field. From a promising career in the AFL to overcoming personal challenges and making an impact off the field, his story is one of resilience, redemption, and inspiration.Born into a family deeply rooted in Australian Rules Football, Andrew Krakouer was the son of Jim Krakouer and nephew of Phil Krakouer—two legendary figures who mesmerized North Melbourne fans with their skill and flair in the 1980s. Following in their footsteps, Andrew made his mark in the AFL after being drafted by Richmond in 2000 with the 41st selection.Andrew Krakouer played 102 games for the Tigers between 2001 and 2007, contributing 102 goals and establishing himself as a dynamic forward. His ability to read the game and position himself perfectly made him one of the most dangerous crumbing forwards of his time. Richmond legend Matthew Richardson paid tribute to his former teammate, describing him as ""the best crumbing forward I played with ... the perfect crumber, and he was a good mark for his size as well. When he was on song, he was unbeatable.""Despite his undeniable talent, Krakouer’s journey took a difficult turn when he was delisted by Richmond in 2007 following a legal issue. He was sentenced to four years in prison for intent to cause grievous bodily harm, a setback that threatened to derail his career. However, it was during this period that Krakouer began his journey of redemption.While serving his sentence, Krakouer played football for the prison team, using the sport as a means of personal transformation. Upon his release on parole in 2009, he returned to the WAFL with Swan Districts, determined to reclaim his place in the game he loved.Krakouer’s redemption story reached its peak in 2010 when he delivered a stunning performance in the WAFL Grand Final. He won the Simpson Medal for best on ground, playing a key role in Swan Districts’ thrilling one-point victory over Claremont. His performance that season also earned him the prestigious Sandover Medal, further cementing his remarkable comeback.Former Swan Districts coach Brian Dawson reflected on Krakouer’s journey, stating, ""He owned his sentence with good grace and worked very hard to rehabilitate himself."" His resilience and determination caught the attention of AFL clubs, and in 2011, Collingwood gave him a second chance at the elite level.Krakouer’s return to the AFL with Collingwood was nothing short of inspirational. He played 35 games for the Magpies between 2011 and 2013, kicking 50 goals. One of his most memorable performances came in the 2011 Grand Final, where he kicked three goals in a losing effort against Geelong.That same year, he took home the Mark of the Year award for a spectacular grab against Adelaide, further showcasing his football prowess. Despite struggling with injuries and inconsistency in the following seasons, his impact at Collingwood remained undeniable. Former coach Nathan Buckley acknowledged his contributions, saying, ""Gee he went through a bit in his life, Krak, he probably had the worst of it and the best of it, he showed real grit to fight back and do what he did in his career.""After leaving the AFL in 2013, Krakouer continued to contribute to the game in different ways. He had a short stint in the WAFL with West Perth before transitioning into mentoring and media roles. He became a well-respected broadcaster, co-hosting Yokayi Footy and appearing as a commentator on Fox Footy.His contributions extended beyond football, as he became a voice for Indigenous players and communities. Richmond Football Club CEO Shane Dunne recognized his influence, stating, ""His contributions to the game were matched by the strength of his character and resilience. He was a trailblazer and fittingly wore our colors for the first AFL Dreamtime at the ‘G match in 2005. He was very proud of his culture and someone that young Indigenous players looked up to.""Krakouer’s ability to turn his life around and give back to the community made him an inspiration for many. He shared his experiences with school and community groups, hoping to guide young players and individuals facing adversity.Andrew Krakouer is survived by his partner, Barbara Garlett, and their four daughters. His sudden passing has left the football world in mourning, with tributes pouring in from teammates, coaches, and fans.AFL CEO Andrew Dillon expressed his sorrow, stating, ""To lose him at such an early age is a tragedy, and we hope there can be some peace for his family in this heart-breaking and difficult time.""Also Read: Dogfighting case: Nearly 200 dogs seized from ex-NFL RB LeShon Johnson, the largest federal seizure from one individual His former teammate Matthew Richardson also reflected on Krakouer’s warmth and character, saying, ""He always greeted you with a hug and a warm smile. He had a great sense of humor and was one of those people you felt really good to be around... just a ripper person.""Andrew Krakouer will be remembered not just for his remarkable football skills but also for his impact on the lives of those around him. His legacy as a player, mentor, and advocate for Indigenous communities will continue to inspire generations to come.","Former AFL star Andrew Krakouer passed away at the age of 42 due to a suspected heart attack at his family home in Perth.

Derrick Rose’s journey: From overcoming childhood struggles to becoming a devoted father

Derrick Rose opens up about fatherhood and breaking the cycle



Derrick Rose dazzled fans for years with his explosive speed and gravity-defying plays. But his most meaningful role has nothing to do with basketball—it’s about being a father. Growing up in Chicago’s Englewood neighborhood without a father figure, Rose faced obstacles that could have derailed his dreams. Instead, he turned that absence into motivation, vowing to be the kind of dad he never had.From the moment he picked up a basketball, Derrick Rose was on a mission to become something greater than his circumstances. But his drive wasn’t just about making it to the NBA . ""My dad wasn’t around at all. I took it as motivation where it’s like I’mma smash everything that he even wanted to dream about,"" Rose once revealed. For years, he held onto the belief that his father might be out there, watching his rise to stardom. The painful truth eventually surfaced—his father, Walker, had passed away long ago.That revelation didn’t slow him down. Instead, it fueled his legendary work ethic, pushing him to become the youngest MVP in NBA history. But as time went on, his priorities shifted. The game that once defined him took a backseat to something far more important—his family.As the 2024-25 NBA season approached, Rose made a decision that surprised many: he was stepping away from the game to dedicate himself fully to his children. ""I’ve been thinking about it for a while, and I feel like I need to fully dedicate myself to my son now,"" he shared. His five-year-old son, London, initially struggled with the news. ""He was very sad,"" Rose admitted. But as they embraced this new chapter, father and son grew even closer. ""From that moment on, it has been all love.""Rose’s commitment to fatherhood was on full display on March 29, 2025, when he was given the honor of throwing the ceremonial first pitch at the Chicago White Sox ’s opening game against the LA Angels . But this wasn’t just about baseball—it was a family affair. With London gripping his hand, Rose stepped onto the mound at Guaranteed Rate Field, the crowd cheering as he delivered the pitch. His wife, Alaina Anderson, and their seven-year-old daughter, Layla, beamed from the stands, capturing the moment on their phones. It was a full-circle experience for the Chicago native—this time, not as an NBA star, but as a father making memories with his children.During the post-game press conference, London sat comfortably in his father’s arms as Rose reflected on the moment. Later, he shared a touching Instagram post: ""That smile means the WORLD to me. Me not having my dad around makes me go ALL in with my kids. I wish I would’ve met my dad. We would’ve laughed about how I crush everything he did as a MAN lol.""Rose isn’t just present in his children’s lives—he’s leading by example. Speaking on the Club 520 Podcast, he explained what fatherhood means to him. ""My kids call me dad; I love when they call me dad. Not ‘father’—that doesn’t sound right to me,"" he said. ""It’s about the time that I’m putting in, giving every one of my kids that equal time.""His eldest son, PJ Rose, has begun carving out his own basketball journey, but Rose makes it clear that there’s no pressure. ""You’re your own person; you are PJ Rose; you are your own entity,"" he tells him, emphasizing that his son doesn’t have to live in his shadow.Discipline and structure are just as important to Rose as encouragement. ""I have to be a little bit more strict on [PJ] as far as making sure he gets up on time for school, taking out the garbage—all little chore stuff. But it creates your character, you know what I’m saying?""Also Read: “ Can’t ask for a better birthday weekend”: Ayesha Curry shares her heartfelt reaction to yacht party and Stephen Curry’s touching tribute Derrick Rose’s basketball legacy is set in stone, but his most meaningful accomplishment has nothing to do with stats or accolades. It’s about breaking the cycle of absence and making sure his kids never experience the loneliness he once did. From a childhood without a father to becoming a hands-on dad, Rose has rewritten his own story. His time in the NBA may be over, but in the game of life, he’s still delivering clutch performances—this time, as a father first.","Derrick Rose is the youngest MVP in NBA history.

Joe Rogan commends Kevin Ferguson for his transition from street fighter to professional MMA fighter

Joe Rogan Experience #2296 - Big Jay Oakerson

Despite a short-lived career in MMA, Kevin Ferguson , aka Kimbo Slice , was known for his violent striking style. In fact, this is the very reason that Joe Rogan believed the former UFC veteran would have been a good fit for a promotion like, a promotion that runs on the idea of no gloves and all fists. In a recent podcast of the Joe Rogan Experience, the commentator praised thefor his courageous step into the Octagon when he was in his late 30s. Ferguson died in 2016, succumbing to chest congestion.Bahamian-born American MMA fighter and professional boxer Kevin Ferguson was primarily a bare-knuckle boxer, whose videos of the mutual combat street fight were very popular. His popularity even earned him the title of The King of the Web Brawlers by the American magazine Rolling Stone. Before being signed by the UFC, Ferguson was associated with promotions like Elite XC and was part of the TV series The Ultimate Fighter , created by Dana White. His official heavyweight debut at UFC 113 was his last match at the UFC after he lost the bout to Matt Mitrione in the second round. After UFC, the fighter tried to sign with the promotion Strikeforce, but the negotiations failed owing to a disputed pay structure. Even though the fighter had announced his retirement from MMA and had decided to venture into professional boxing, an announcement by Bellator MMA in 2015 marked the return of Ferguson into the world of MMA.Ferguson was one of the few fighters who showed that a backyard street fighter from Miami could do what most people deemed impossible. The determination and strong will of Ferguson are much appreciated and applauded today. On the Joe Rogan Experience, the American podcaster praised the fighter for his striking style and the courage he showed by entering the world of MMA at an unconventional age.“If he was fighting just stand-up only, he’s very dangerous. Like if he was involved in like if bareknuckle boxing was around back then he would have been a huge star of bareknuckle boxing. He would have f***** a lot of people up bareknuckle boxing.” Rogan further added, “Kimbo had a bunch of injuries from football. You can’t really grapple at full capacity with knee injuries and learn grappling at 35 or however old he was…But dude kudos to that guy for having the courage to actually get into the UFC and The Ultimate Fighter.”Also read: Khabib Nurmagomedov’s retirement: Chael Sonnen reveals the real reason he left MMA The Bare-Knuckle Fighting Championship was founded in 2018, two years after the fighter passed away.

In a season where home advantage has become a hot topic, the struggling Mumbai Indians are hoping to secure their first win of IPL 2025 during their opening home match at Wankhede Stadium against the defending champions, Kolkata Knight Riders tonight (March 31).MI's difficulties seem to be a continuation from last season, and they've started this campaign with two losses, having fallen short against the Gujarat Titans on Friday.Having begun the season with a 0-2 record, MI, traditionally slow starters, need to regroup quickly to avoid a disastrous start to the tournament. Compounding their troubles, captain Hardik Pandya was fined Rs 12 lakhs for a slow over-rate against the Titans, having already been suspended from the first match of IPL 2024 for a similar infraction. He needs to be cautious going forward.The absence of the world's No. 1 fast bowler, Jasprit Bumrah, due to injury adds to MI’s challenges. Additionally, former captain Rohit Sharma’s performance continues to disappoint; he has failed to live up to expectations, scoring in the single digits for six of his last nine IPL innings. In Friday's game, he recorded his second consecutive low score, making just eight runs and suffering yet another dismissal due to a remarkable inswinger from Mohammed Siraj.On the flip side, KKR will boost their lineup with the return of star spinner and explosive opener Sunil Narine, who missed the last match due to illness.Narine was seen training with the team at Wankhede Stadium on Friday, which bodes well for the visitors. Moreover, under the leadership of head coach Chandrakant Pandit and captain Ajinkya Rahane, KKR is well-acquainted with the conditions in Mumbai.After an impressive eight-wicket victory over Rajasthan Royals in their last game, propelled by Quinton de Kock's unbeaten 97, KKR will look to carry that momentum forward. A recent controversy involving pitch preferences at Eden Gardens adds intrigue, but they are likely focused on getting the win.Wankhede Stadium will host its first match of IPL 2025 tonight. Last season, four of the seven matches at this venue were won by teams batting first. 188 was the average first innings total in IPL 2024 while 234 was the highest score (MI vs DC).

'MS Dhoni can't bat 10 overs running full stick',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/ms-dhoni-cant-bat-10-overs-running-full-stick/articleshow/119842457.cms,"File image of MS Dhoni (ANI Photo)

GUWAHATI: Chennai Super Kings ( CSK ) are facing a tricky situation regarding MS Dhoni ’s batting position. Having drawn a lot of criticism for coming in to bat at No. 9 against Royal Challengers Bengaluru last week, Dhoni came in to bat at No.7 on Sunday against Rajasthan Royals.His team needed 54 off 25 balls at that point, but Dhoni couldn’t take this team over the line. When he departed after scoring 16 off 11 balls (1x4, 1x6) — Shimron Hetmyer taking a superb catch at deep mid-wicket — CSK still needed 19 off the last five legal deliveries from Sandeep Sharma. They failed to go the distance and lost by six runs.Asked to explain Dhoni’s flickering appearances with the bat and his changing batting positions, CSK head coach Stephen Fleming said, “It’s a time thing. It’s MS who judges it. His body, his knees aren’t what they used to be. He’s moving okay but there’s still an attrition aspect to it. He can’t bat 10 overs running full stick. So, he will gauge on the day what he can give us.“If the game is in the balance, he’ll go a little bit earlier and he backs other players when opportunities are up. So he’s balancing that. I said it last year, he is too valuable to us for leadership and wicketkeeping. To throw him in at 9, 10 overs... he’s actually never done that. So, from around 13, 14 overs he’s looking to go depending on the situation,” the former New Zealand captain said.Analysing their second straight loss this season after the opening win against Mumbai Indians, Fleming said, “It’s probably the two Powerplays. Our Powerplay with the ball went for best part of 80 runs and we were only able to manage mid-40s or early-40s. That’s the big difference.""We were also sloppy in the field compared to Rajasthan, who were outstanding. The start of a new three-year cycle (following a mega IPL auction) is always a little bit difficult, especially if you’re just short of a little bit of form.”",CSK lost by six runs to Rajasthan Royals on Sunday. MS Dhoni came in to bat at No.7 and scored 16 off 11 balls. CSK head coach Stephen Fleming said Dhoni's body is not what it used to be. Fleming also said CSK were sloppy in the field.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119842615,imgsize-58176,width-400,resizemode-4/119842615.jpg"

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

Former NFL star Channing Crowder questions Bronny James’ future



Bronny James. Image via: NBAE via Getty Images

Bronny James has been under the microscope since stepping into professional basketball. As the son of NBA legend LeBron James , expectations are naturally sky-high, and every move he makes is heavily scrutinized. While some analysts and fans have praised his development, not everyone is convinced. Former NFL player Channing Crowder recently took a strong stance against the young guard’s NBA potential.During a recent episode of The Pivot Podcast, Channing Crowder didn’t hold back when discussing Bronny’s performance in the NBA G League. He criticized Bronny’s individual play while questioning his overall level of competition in the league. “I’m not going to stay in my lane ’cause they were losing by 30, he got in the game, he made 17 points…He just shot some threes and gets cooked defensively. I want my (Lakers) hat to reinforce my opinion (that) Bronny should not be (in the NBA),” Crowder stated.He went on to dismiss the quality of the G League entirely, suggesting that even “Little Chan” could drop 31 points in a game. Though Crowder made it clear that he respects LeBron James and his family, he still believes Bronny is not NBA-ready. Crowder seemingly echoed Bronny and LeBron James’ long-time critic Stephen A. Smith, who has been tangled into the back-and-forth debate with the Lakers legend.Criticism has been a constant for Bronny’s basketball career. Ever since he entered the NBA as the 55th overall pick, doubters have constantly questioned whether his name, rather than his skill, secured him a spot in the league. Many compare him unfairly to his father, a generational talent, rather than evaluating his game on its own merits.Bronny let his game speak for itself. During the South Bay Lakers' 122-118 win over the Santa Cruz Warriors, he put up a career-high 39 points. This breakout performance surpassed his previous best of 31 points, which he set on January 24 against the Rip City Remix.Following the game, Bronny addressed the criticism head-on in a post-game interview with Timothy Parker.""Just that I belong out there. That’s all I’m trying to prove. A lot of people say I don’t, but I just come out, work every day, try to get better every day and prove myself every day… All the criticism that’s thrown my way, it’s just amazing to shut all that down and keep going.”Also Read: ""Our business is a piece of sh*t"": Michael Wilbon criticizes ESPN and Stephen A.

Regardless, Bronny is determined to create his own identity beyond the shadow of his legendary father, James, who is arguably the greatest of all time in the league.",Bronny James has been under the microscope since stepping into professional basketball.

MUMBAI: So nervous was Ashwani Kumar before making his IPL debut for the Mumbai Indians against the Kolkata Knight Riders on Monday night that he couldn’t even have his lunch, preferring to just have a banana instead.A few hours later, the 23-year-old left-arm pacer dazzled his way into the limelight under the lights at the Wankhede Stadium, and became one of the most googled names in India. Enjoying the best-ever debut by an Indian bowler in the history of the IPL, the young turk from Punjab dismantled KKR’s batting line-up, taking four for 24 in a sensational three-over spell that broke the back of KKR.Inspired by Ashwini’s dream initiation into the IPL, MI, after suffering defeats in their first two matches, finally got their campaign going, as the hosts logged their first win of IPL-2025 in style, thrashing KKR by eight wickets with 43 balls remaining in the match.Playing their first match at home this season, the five-time IPL champs thus enjoyed a sweet homecoming.After asking KKR to take first strike, MI shot out the defending IPL champs for 116 in just 16.2 overs. Ashwini , of course, capitalized on early strikes by MI’s senior pacers Deepak Chahar ( two for 19 in two) and Trent Boult (1-23 in four overs), while the hosts also thrived on some electric fielding by Naman Dhir, who took three catches, the last one, a diving effort to pouch Harshit Rana (4) off Puthur, being a gem.MI than coasted home by the 13th over itself, as their new recruit, South African opener Ryan Rickelton (62 not out, 41b, 4x4, 5x6) tore into the KKJR attack, while Suryakumar Yadav (29 not out, 9b, 3x4, 2x6) finished off the game in trademark style, scooping an Andre Russell delivery over the ‘keeper’s head for a six. Never mind that their former captain Rohit Sharma (13) failed again.Missing out on his lunch, Ashwani chose to feast on KKR’s batsmen instead, scalping the opposition captain Ajinkya Rahane (11) with his first ball in the IPL, before following up with the wickets of Rinku Singh (17), Manish Pandey (19) and Andre Russell (5) to leave a 30,000 home crowd, making a deafening noise by now, delirious.Flashing an infectious smile after his first-match heroics, Ashwani, who hails from a small town called jhanjeri, near Chandigarh, revealed that it was his captain Hardik Pandya’s advice to bowl a sort of a ‘bodyline’ that did the trick for him. “Hardik bhai told me to bowl short and to bowl at the body and that led to a wicket. In my village, everyone would be watching. They were just waiting for my debut, and by God's grace, I got an opportunity tonight and did well.”Introduced into the attack in the fourth over, the Punjab quick struck gold with his first ball in the IPL as Rahane sliced a full and wide delivery to Tilak Varma, who nearly made a mess of the catch before recovering well to pouch the ball with his left hand. He then had Rinku caught at deep point by Naman Dhir.Turning his IPL debut into a fairytale story, he unleashed a ’jaffa’, as Pandey was bowled neck and crop by a back-of-length delivery that cut him into half, leaving him caught at the crease before hitting the top of leg stump.For his fourth wicket , the talented rookie, after setting up Russell with a few short balls, produced a slightly fuller ball that Russell went to dispatch into the crowd, but only ended up hearing the ‘death rattle.’Only three bowlers have enjoyed a better IPL debut than Ashwani, with Alzarri Joseph (6-12 for MI vs SRH in 2019) heading the list. Ashwani has only played four senior T20 matches prior to his IPL debut, in addition to two Ranji Trophy and four List A matches for Punjab.This is the first time in his career that Ashwani picked up a four-wicket haul in a match. His previous-best was three for 37 in List A cricket and one for 19 in T20 cricket.The seamer has a really good and a deceptive bouncer. Known for his pace variations, Ashwani also has very good wide yorker and impressed the MI talent scouts in the Sher-E-Punjab T20 Trophy last year, where he closed out plenty of matches with his effective death bowling.Clearly, MI’s talent scouts are doing something right, though credit must also be given to MI’s bowling coach-former India bowling coach Paras Mhambrey for ensuring a talent like Ashwani was provided this big stage early in his promising career.If it was left-arm spinner Vignesh Puthur who made an impressive debut in the opening match against Chennai Super Kings, taking three for 32 in four overs, it was Ashwini’s turn to zoom into the limelight at the Wankhede.Playing at the Wankhede for the first time in MI colours, Boult gave the hosts the perfect start when he sent KKR opener Sunil Narine packing for a duck with a signature full delivery, just the fourth ball of the match.Chahar accounted for Quinton de Kock (1), who was well-caught by a leaping Ashwani at mid-off in the second over, and Venkatesh Iyer (edged behind an upper-cut. Tottering at 45 for five in seven overs, KKR were saved the embarrassment of being bowled out under 100 purely due to the cameos of local boy Angkrish Raghuvanshi (26, 16b, 3x4, 1x6) and Ramandeep Singh (22, 12b, 1x4, 2x6).",Ashwani Kumar makes IPL debut for Mumbai Indians against Kolkata Knight Riders.

LUCKNOW: Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) will be eyeing their first victory at home this season when they take on Punjab Kings (PBKS) at the Ekana International Stadium in Lucknow on Tuesday.Skipper Rishabh Pant will be keen to make his presence felt after LSG suffered a narrow one-wicket defeat in their season’s opener against Delhi Capitals in Vizag. However, LSG made a strong comeback with an impressive five-wicket victory over Sunrisers Hyderabad in the second away outing, thanks to Nicholas Pooran (70), Mitchell Marsh (55), and Shardul Thakur (4/34), who excelled with his impressive bowling.LSG’s top-order was explosive, with Mitchell Marsh and Nicholas Pooran creating a strong foundation for the team. Aiden Markram, like Pant, did not perform well and will be hoping to make amends.Pant, who became the most expensive player in the IPL auction last year, will be determined to justify his hefty Rs 27 crore price tag after low returns as a batter in the first two outings. A good innings in front of the home crowd will go a long way towards easing some of the pressure.Mention should also be made of Abdul Samad, who scored an eight-ball 22 against SRH, while Shardul Thakur, who replaced Mohsin Khan, has done well with the ball. LSG have strategically opted for three spinners on the slow Ekana pitch and will look to Ravi Bishnoi to deliver.Seasoned leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal will be the leader of the spin attack for Punjab, with Glenn Maxwell also expected to roll his arm over. This will also be an interesting clash between the most expensive and second-most expensive players in IPL history.In contrast to Pant’s struggles, Shreyas Iyer, who was roped in for Rs 26.75 cr, led from the front with a match-winning 97 not out of 42 deliveries against Gujarat Titans.

Overcoming challenges and changing Mindset

A tough IPL and a fitting T20 farewell

A career of highs and lows: Rohit Sharma's journey

Bombay Sports Exchange Episode 1: Interview with Sanjog Gupta, CEO (Sports) at JioStar

NEW DELHI: Reflecting on India's incredible run in ICC tournaments, Rohit Sharma highlighted the team’s resilience over the past nine months, navigating cricket’s highs and lows. Under his leadership, India won the ICC Champions Trophy and the T20 World Cup , but the only blemish was the heartbreaking defeat to Australia in the 2023 ODI World Cup final.""Look at what this team has achieved in this big three tournaments. After playing the tournament like that and getting defeated only once, and that too in a final (2023 ODI World Cup),"" Rohit said in a video posted by Mumbai Indians on their X (formerly Twitter) handle. ""But imagine if we had won that as well to go undefeated in three ICC tournaments is crazy, never heard of, but I will take this, 23 wins in 24 games is unheard of. It looks very nice from the outside, but the team has gone through a lot of ups and downs.""We had some really tough times as well, but that is when you've got to celebrate. If you do things like this, you've got to celebrate. I feel that all the people who played these three tournaments deserve respect.""Rohit credited India’s success to the shift in mindset that began after their semifinal exit in the 2022 T20 World Cup in Australia. The team focused on clarity, fearless cricket, and collective responsibility.""But thereafter, we made a lot of things clear with the players that this is what we expect from you, and this is how we want you to play. So there was a lot of clarity, a lot of conversations with the players to perform,"" he added.""There needs to be freedom amongst the group so that they go out and play without any fear. There were a few lows, a few series that we lost, but we never panicked and we never went away from our thought process. When you are building a squad, the first thing that you need to put in front of you is what the team want. Where did we lack in the previous series, previous tournaments? Why did we not get the results?""Interestingly, Rohit's remarks came on the day when BCCI’s top brass was set to discuss India's future roadmap, though the meeting was later postponed.The journey was not without setbacks. In between the three ICC tournaments, India lost a rare home Test series to New Zealand and struggled in Australia. But Rohit saw these challenges as learning experiences.""These nine months are a perfect example of how life is -- it’s always going to be up and down. Any sportsman going through a low wants to fight back, bounce back, and turn things around. And that’s exactly what we did,"" he reflected.Rohit also opened up about his disappointing 2024 IPL season, where Mumbai Indians finished last. Despite the setback, he remained focused on the bigger picture -- ending his T20I career on a high.He continued, ""It (2024 IPL) was a low for the team, and I think we didn't play our best cricket also, and there were so many things after IPL to look forward to.""""I knew there was a World Cup coming up and I had to shift my focus to the World Cup, knowing that this is going to be my last T20 World Cup. So I really wanted to make it count, and obviously I knew without the help of other players it is not going to be possible. So we just got around as a group, and there was a lot of collective performance from everyone throughout the tournament,"" he said.India went on to defeat South Africa by 7 runs in Barbados, securing the T20 World Cup title.""My career for 17-18 years has always been up and down, and these nine months were no different,"" Rohit admitted.Speaking about his journey with Mumbai Indians, he acknowledged the changes over the years, adding, ""Obviously, since the time I started till now lot of things have changed because I used to bat middle-order then, now I am opening the batting. I was captain then (MI), but now I am not the captain. There were a few teammates with whom I won championships, they are not there, they are in the coaching role now.""So, the roles have changed, a lot of things have changed but the mindset has not changed. What I want to do for this team has not changed, just to go out there and win games and trophies, that is what MI is known for all these years.""","Rohit Sharma reflects on India's incredible run in ICC tournaments.

Lionel Messi made an impressive return from injury, scoring within two minutes of coming on as a substitute in Inter Miami 's 2-1 victory over the Philadelphia Union on Saturday.The Argentine star had been sidelined with an adductor strain, which caused him to miss Argentina's World Cup qualifiers during the international break.

The goal came after Jordi Alba's run down the left flank, with Benjamin Cremaschi providing the final low pass to Taylor.Messi entered the game in the 55th minute under coach Javier Mascherano's direction.

The Hungarian midfielder controlled Quinn Sullivan's cross from the right before finishing with a precise shot.Inter Miami remains undefeated and leads the Eastern Conference with four wins in their first five matches of the season.The team faces a challenging schedule ahead, starting with a CONCACAF Champions Cup quarter-final first leg against LAFC in Los Angeles on Wednesday. They then host Toronto the following Sunday before returning to Los Angeles for the second leg.""We didn't want to risk him from the start because we thought he might be at risk playing the whole game, but we did want him to get some minutes,"" said the Argentine coach.""The plan is that he can recover and travel to Los Angeles. He played today because he was fine. Maybe he wasn't ready for the full 90 minutes but it was good for him to play 45 minutes.

NEW DELHI: A high-voltage Indian Premier League (IPL) clash between Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) and Chennai Super Kings ( CSK ) saw tempers flare, with Virat Kohli and Khaleel Ahmed at the center of an intense face-off.The heated moment came after RCB broke their 17-year jinx at Chepauk with a commanding 50-run victory over CSK.The spark was ignited during RCB’s innings when Khaleel Ahmed bowled a sharp bouncer to Kohli, who missed the delivery.The CSK pacer followed through aggressively, getting uncomfortably close and giving a fierce stare at Kohli. The RCB batter did not take kindly to it.However, the real drama unfolded after the match during the customary handshake.Kohli, who scored 31 off 30 balls, was visibly agitated when Khaleel approached him -- possibly to extend a peace offering.While shaking his hand, Kohli shoved the pacer away, making his frustration evident.Watch:Standing nearby, MS Dhoni watched the incident unfold with his signature calm demeanor, but the exchange was already caught on camera, sparking discussions among fans.Later, Kohli was seen having a light-hearted chat with Ravindra Jadeja before his demeanour suddenly changed upon noticing Khaleel Ahmed approaching him.His aggressive reaction was caught on camera, showcasing an intense exchange. However, the heated moment eventually cooled down, ending with both players shaking hands in a show of sportsmanship.Earlier in the game, RCB posted a solid 196/7, thanks to a gritty 51 off 32 by Rajat Patidar and a late cameo from Tim David (22 not out off 8).Despite a brisk start by Phil Salt (32 off 16) and Devdutt Padikkal (27 off 14), the innings stumbled in the middle overs before Patidar and David provided the finishing touches.CSK’s chase faltered early as Josh Hazlewood (3/21) and Yash Dayal (2/18) rattled their top order, leaving them at 52/4.Rachin Ravindra (41 off 31) and MS Dhoni (30 not out off 16) fought back, but it wasn’t enough as CSK fell short, finishing at 146/8.While RCB celebrated a historic win, Kohli’s fiery moment ensured that the drama didn’t end with the match.READ ALSO: MS Dhoni becomes CSK’s highest run-scorer in IPL history",Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) beat Chennai Super Kings (CSK) by 50 runs.
