Buried Past

.

Walk down the narrow lanes of this small town — located about 45km southwest of Chandigarh — and you’d find it hard to believe that Chinese scholar Hiuen Tsang trod these very paths some 1,300 years ago. Or that north Indian ruler Prithviraj Chauhan had once passed this way at the head of his army.It’s as if history no longer felt welcome here and moved out, mournful and uncared for. But there was a time when history ebbed and flowed through its narrow lanes. Sirhind — or Sar-iHind, the crown of India — was, after all, the last major outpost before invaders reached the Yamuna. Temples of the Hindu Shahis — who made Sirhind their capital, with its grandeur said to be second only to Lahore’s — still stand south of Islamabad, the oldest surviving temples in Pakistan.But monuments and structures that are often eloquent narrators of past glories stand in Sirhind as mute spectators, listlessly dotting farmlands and alleyways. In many cases, they exist — plastered, painted over, forgotten — as bricks that were repurposed as construction material to build nameless walls of homes that have sprung up in recent decades.The town, which forms a twin city with the adjacent Fatehgarh Sahib, has not only shrunk in size and significance, it has also gone missing from Punjab’s mindscape and its cultural discourse.It is where Humayun defeated the Suris to re-establish Mughal rule and where Guru Gobind Singh’s sons were so cruelly bricked up alive. Sirhind is said by some to go back to the time of the Mahabharata, a melting pot of lore and legend. But, then, how did history itself become a victim in historic Sirhind?Dr Daljit Singh, professor of history at Punjabi University, Patiala, toldthat Sirhind is a treasure trove for archaeologists, but it hasn’t got its due. Encroachments are gobbling up what should be protected spaces. The sense one gets on talking to locals is that every brick and old structure here can tell its own history. The only tough part is to actually find and identify them for what they really are.There is little evidence of any sustained effort by Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) to explore the historical importance of the area. Despite its rich past as a major provincial centre, there has not been a survey in years to identify historical remains that may lie buried beneath the ground.Some sites, like Gurudwara Shri Fatehgarh Sahib, Rauza Sharif Shrine and a Jain Mandir, are well maintained. But many historical places like Jahazi Haveli of Diwan Todar Mal — not to be confused with Raja Todar Mal of Akbar’s Navratna fame — Aam Khas Bagh and Sadna Kasai Masjid have remained neglected for long. Areas like Harbanspura, Mahadian, Bara and Talanian, where one would stumble on relics three decades ago, are yet to be explored. Buildings and monuments lie crumbling in wheat fields.In the 19th century, French traveller V Jacquemont had described Sirhind as “the biggest ruins in India after Delhi”. Yet today, few ever talk of it. As if it had fallen off the map. There is no trace of the Hindu Shahis in any museum in the country.Elderly residents of Sirhind recall instances of when tilling of the land would turn up artefacts. “Every few days, we would hear someone’s plough had dug up something from history. Bricks were very common to find. Even now such articles turn up. The famous Laalan Wala Bazar near Talanian village is all farmland now,” said 77-yearold Sukhdev Singh. “There were at least four tombs in the area, but we know of two, the Ustad and Shagird tombs. We don’t know what happened to the other two,” he added.Shamsher Singh, 75, of Talanian village, said silver coins, Sirhind bricks and artefacts of various shapes were regularly found near tombs and in the fields. “There was a raised structure near the village but it gradually disappeared as people levelled it up. Now, farming is going on in the same ground. Govt should have protected these historical sites,” he said.At Mahadiyan, famed for how often buried history was dug up during farming, former sarpanch Balwant Singh, 75, said one of the mausoleums he saw as a child has vanished and houses have come up there. “Some 30-35 years ago, ‘Tailay’, which was a sort of currency, would be found in the fields every now and then. Who knows what else would have been found had there been a proper dig?” Khalifa Syed Muhammad Sadiq Raza, who manages affairs at the mausoleum (dargah) of the 17th-century Sufi saint Shaikh Ahmad Faruqi Sirhindi (Mujaddid Alf Sani), said Sirhind was an important province for the Mughals as it lay midway between Delhi and Lahore.Punjab Shahi Imam, Maulana Usman Ludhianvi, said, “Sirhind is an important historical area and needs to be explored in the historical context”.Anecdotes and tales of Sirhind’s buried and forgotten history still keep coming up in conversations. But there are not many who want the past to be dug up. Their fear is that history unearthed would before long get overrun by the present. And will Sirhind then remain the land of fables and myth? Asked about excavations in Sirhind, Sanjeev Kumar Tewari, director-tourism, culture and archaeology, said none has been carried out in the recent past. ASI is carrying out excavations at Sanghol in Fatehgarh Sahib and some other places nearby, he said.“As of now, Jahazi Haveli is being restored. Around 80% of the work has been completed,” he said. Asked why other monuments are in such a state of disrepair, he said minor restoration work was done at the Ustad and Shagird tombs and at the Tomb of Bibi Subhan. “We are getting estimates drawn up for restoration of other monuments. Also, the property towards the rear of Aam Khas Bagh is being given out for commercial usage in PPP mode,” he said.Deputy commissioner Sona Thind acknowledged that Aam Khas Bagh and other tombs needed maintenance and said she has written about it to the tourism and cultural affairs department.","There is little evidence of any sustained effort by Archaeological Survey of India to explore the historical importance of the area.

NEW DELHI: The Kerala unit of Congress is again at the centre of a controversy after its ""cow urine research"" remarks on Padma Shri winner IIT Madras director V Kamakoti. The comments received a sharp retort from Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu who came out in defence of Kamakoti.The Kerala Congress, in a post on X, congratulated Kamakoti on the civilian honour while taking a dig at his work, saying, “Congratulations to V Kamakoti on receiving the honour. The nation recognises your bleeding edge research on Cow Urine at IIT Madras, taking Gomutra to world stage.”Reacting on January 26, Vembu highlighted Kamakoti’s academic credentials and role in national service. “Professor Kamakoti works in deep tech: micro-processor design. He is the Director of IIT-Madras, the best technological institution in India. He serves in the NSAB. He richly deserves the honour,” he wrote on X.Defending the scientific validity of studying traditional substances, Vembu said, “I have defended him on scientific grounds and I will do so again: cow dung and cow urine have excellent microbiome that could be valuable for humans. It is the slavish colonial mindset that thinks these are not scientific propositions worthy of investigation.Some day, when Harvard or MIT publish a study on this, these enslaved minds would worship that as the gospel truth. ”Kamakoti, who is among this year’s Padma Shri award ees, earlier described the honour as a collective achievement. In a video shared on January 25, he said, “The Padma Shri award means only thing to me, that I will put all the best efforts towards Viksit Bharat @ 2047, this award is not possible as an individual, it's a collective effort, I dedicate this award to all who contributed...

"Use gender-neutral terms, courts told",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/use-gender-neutral-terms-courts-told/articleshow/127578800.cms,"ANI file photo

NEW DELHI: Delhi High Court has heeded a suggestion of a woman district judge, which came a few years ago, and cleared a proposal on the use of gender-neutral terms in court-related documents.In a communication on Jan 15, the court administration told all district courts to replace the requirement of the father's/husband's name with that of the parent's/spouse's name. A missive from the registrar-general to all district judges heading the seven courts referred to letters from 2021 and 2022 ""of Ms. Savita Rao, DHJS"".The letter said that the administrative and general supervision committee had directed that ""necessary changes may be made in the official communication, forms and documents... so as to incorporate gender-neutral terms like spouse's name and/or parent's (mother/father's) name, instead of providing only father's/husband's name"". The changes must be communicated to all the districts for action at their end, the letter said.Once implemented, the change is expected to show in personal files of judicial officers, the identity cards of court staff, their provident fund forms and medical claim cards, to give a few examples, a sitting judge said.In 2021, Rao, the in-charge of the Saket court mediation wing, flagged her views regarding the absence of any option for a litigant or a court staff member filling up a court form.""I am in receipt of official communications where there is only the option of providing father's/husband's name. The need of the current situation in empowering women, treating women with equality and equal rights, can be resolved only when the centuries-old Indian patriarchal system is dealt with by better law and procedure. Today, it is immensely needed that a woman has the freedom to choose her surname after marriage, and also to opt for providing either the father's or the mother's name, and for the children/men to carry their mother's name as well,"" Rao's letter, addressed to the then district judge, said.Rao, now the district judge of the commercial court in Saket, pointed out that despite the nod from Delhi govt long ago to include the name of the mother in all official documents, no option was given in the documents as far as court-related work is concerned.""Women have to use either the husband's/father's name, and even the men have no option to use the name of their mothers, if they want to, instead of the father's name, ""with no consideration ever in mind"" for the option to use wife's name, she said.The insistence that women must provide the father's/husband's name, and that children/men must provide only the father's name, reiterates the patriarchal norm that women and children are belongings. These norms look down upon alternative family structures, Rao added.The letter argued that judicial institutions are ""the torchbearer for reforms in society"". Therefore, ""it is probably high time that we also move away from such outdated thinking, ie insistence to provide only father's/husband's name,"" the judge said.Rao urged the decisionmakers in the judiciary to make appropriate changes in correspondence, documents and forms to reflect the new social reality.","Delhi High Court has cleared a proposal on the use of gender-neutral terms in court-related documents.

CHANDIGARH: A 27-year-old first-generation Army officer from Bathinda commanded a T-90 Bhishma main battle tank at the Republic Day parade this year, as Captain Vipanjot Virk of the Indian Army ’s 77 Armoured Regiment led it along Kartavya Path. Commissioned as the first Young Officer of the regiment, Captain Virk traces his decision to join the Army to formative school years marked by regular exposure to military role models, including a defining 2013 interaction with then COAS General Bikram Singh that left a lasting impression.“I knew about the Army through the school’s legacy of producing officers. You grow up seeing seniors joining the forces, and that makes the idea of serving in uniform feel achievable,” said Captain Vipanjot Virk.He said a defining moment came in 2013 during his school’s Founders Day celebrations, when General Bikram Singh, then Chief of the Army Staff and an alumnus of the school, visited the campus for Founders’ Day. He met the Army chief during the event and that the interaction strengthened his resolve to pursue a career in the armed forces.Captain Virk is part of the Indian Army’s 77 Armoured Regiment, a unit raised in recent years. He was commissioned into the regiment as one of its first officers and has been associated with it since its initial phase, including its raising and training activities.A resident of village Virk Khurd near Bathinda, Captain Virk is the only child of Iqbal Singh Virk.With no prior family background in the armed forces, he joined the Army as a first-generation officer from Punjab’s rural belt.“My son’s interest in the Army developed during his school years,” said his father, a farmer. “We never had anyone in the forces in our family, but he was clear about his goal very early and worked consistently towards it.”He completed his schooling in 2016 and joined the National Defence Academy in 2017. Virk credits his early exposure to military life to his time at the Punjab Public School, Nabha, which has a long association with the armed forces and has produced several officers over the years, including Major Anuj Sood, who got martyred in Handwara in 2020.","Captain Vipanjot Virk is part of the Indian Army’s 77 Armoured Regiment.

As we turn 76 as a constitutional Republic, we should underline a lesserknown and unique facet of the Gita and the Bible of our governance. Most constitutions begin with black letter law; ours begins with art. If the aim of art is to represent not the outward appearance of things, but their inward significance, the best metaphor for the Indian Republic is a document that speaks to the soul before it speaks to the statute.India’s Constitution is widely celebrated as a legal masterpiece, a visionary consolidation of checks, balances, rights and responsibilities. But buried in the book is a quieter triumph: 22 handdrawn illustrations, each accompanying one of its first 22 Parts, and rendering a book of law into a living tapestry of our civilisational spirit.Nandalal Bose and his Shantiniketan associates were not decorating after the fact. They were intentionally and symbolically rendering the spirit of each constitutional Part. It is spirit, not text, that is reflected in the design. With each page we turn, we step into an art gallery of Indian being.This is where aesthetics meet authority. There are a handful of countries where the Constitution is also a work of art.Ours is one of them.Crafted in flowing calligraphy by Prem Raizada and illumined by Bose’s team, the Constitution is handwritten, hand-painted and heart-born. Every page radiates an aesthetic that marries legal form with cultural substance. The intricate patterns of the Preamble, the artistic flourish of the Ashokan Emblem, the quiet reverence of Himalayan magnificence: each stroke reminds us that beauty is not superficial, but constitutional.The artists, paid Rs 25 per page, made priceless manuscripts, which are today enshrined in helium-filled chambers in the Parliament Library, more revered than rare manuscripts, more sacred than statute books. As an illustrated ‘Gita of Governance’, the Constitution’s illustrated manuscript does not shout but whispers in ink. Its 22 illustrations serve as metaphors for the Parts they accompany, symbols that communicate through visual language the values, dilemmas and aspirations that laws alone cannot express.For instance, the pairing of Part III on Fundamental Rights with the conquest of Lanka by Lord Rama is no accident. It evokes the triumph of dharma over tyranny. The depiction of the Dandi March alongside Part XVII on official language is not a coincidence; it is a subtle nod to linguistic unity as an act of peaceful assertion. These aren’t annotations; they are visual philosophies.Such symbolic pairings do more than inform; they inspire. They transform the Constitution from a legal text into a national epic, in equal parts scripture, statute and story.The illustrated Constitution is a Republic in technicolor, where India is illustrated on every page: an India that is inclusive, plural, layered, and luminous. From the seals of Mohenjodaro to the Himalayas, from Nalanda’s scholarly calm to Noakhali’s pain, these illustrations span centuries, religions, regions and ideologies.This is not an India of slogans, but of symbols. Buddha and Mahavira stand alongside Netaji and Shivaji. It is a great way of conveying how the Indian philosophy consists of two binary elements — Yuddha (war) and Buddha (peace). Ashoka canvases along with Lakshmibai. Ram and Krishna converse with Guru Gobind Singh. These are not political choices; they are civilisational ones. The message is profound: India is not made by any one moment or man, but by the multitude.Each page tells a story — not just of governance, but of a people’s quest for meaning, dignity and justice. The illustrations don’t just depict India’s past; they foreshadow its constitutional future. They also reveal the imagination of our founding fathers — men and women who dreamt of a document that did not merely prescribe but evoked, that did not merely legislate but inspired. In doing so, they gave us a map of memory, a charter of culture and a mirror of our moral fibre.In an age of black-andwhite binaries, these lush illustrations are a reminder that Indian constitutionalism is not a single tone; it is a rainbow of responsibilities and rights, shades of heritage and hope. Such images comprise an unspoken preamble, another level of overture — a visual message of the part of the mind that believes, that preps the soul before the brain engages. This document is not just a blueprint for governance. It is a mirror of our moral inheritance.Where other constitutions speak in articles and amendments, ours breathes through allegory and art. This is not ornamental. It is transformative. The illustrated Constitution serves as a counter-narrative to the sterile image of law. It reveals that justice, too, can be beautiful. Democracy, too, can be drawn. Nationhood, too, can be painted.These illustrations also turn the Indian Constitution into an entity reflecting India’s unique constitutional identity. What other Constitution dares to blend Shiva’s cosmic dance with federal finance, or show Akbar while listing bureaucratic services? Where else do deserts, oceans and ancient sculptures frame legal architecture? The uniqueness of our illustrated Constitution lies in its fusion of text and texture, its legal gravitas softened by visual grace. It is India’s original ‘living document’, long before the courts used that phrase.The manuscript’s USP is its humanity, its ability to speak to citizens as much through sight as through statute. It underscores an oft-ignored truth: a Constitution is not just a legal contract; it is a cultural compact. It must speak to the head and the heart, to the reason and the rasa (aesthetic essence). The illustrated Constitution accomplishes this with quiet dignity.In an era of quick fixes and digital templates, the Indian Constitution’s illustrated version is a slow, deliberate and divine act of nation-building. It reflects the care with which India imagined herself. Not just legally, but visually, morally and spiritually.The 22 illustrations are India’s constitutional haiku — short, symbolic and stirring. They are not footnotes. In their silence, they speak. In their stillness, they move. And in their artistry, they awaken a nation’s conscience. They make the Indian Constitution a testament to timelessness.","As we turn 76 as a constitutional Republic, we should underline a lesserknown and unique facet of the Gita and the Bible of our governance.

Patrick Mahomes battles quiet rehab as Brittany Mahomes creates stability for their children,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/patrick-mahomes-battles-quiet-rehab-as-brittany-mahomes-creates-stability-for-their-children/articleshow/127473169.cms,"Patrick Mahomes is enduring a demanding offseason as he recovers from an ACL and LCL tear, limiting his usual family routine. While he focuses on rehabilitation and a possible Week 1 return, Brittany Mahomes is creating joyful moments for their children, helping maintain normalcy as the Chiefs star patiently works through recovery.

Brittany Mahomes steps forward as Patrick Mahomes grinds through rehab

Patrick Mahomes is used to controlling chaos on the field. This offseason, control is not an option. The Kansas City Chiefs quarterback is rehabbing a serious knee injury in near silence, learning patience while his body resets and his routine disappears. Training days have turned into long recovery sessions, and the familiar rhythm of movement, travel, and playtime now looks very different.At home, life keeps moving. Brittany Mahomes has taken on the emotional heavy lifting, making sure Sterling, Bronze, and Golden Raye still experience joy while their father watches more than he participates. The family recently stepped out together, not for football, but for normalcy. It was a small escape, yet a telling one, as Mahomes continues one of the toughest offseasons of his career.The injury changed everything. Patrick Mahomes tore his ACL and LCL late in the season after taking a hit while extending a play against the Chargers. Surgery followed, along with a long recovery timeline that demands restraint, something not often associated with his improvisational style.Brittany documented a family trip to Disney On Ice, sharing moments of Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, and Donald Duck skating as the family briefly stepped away from their Missouri home.She described the day simply as the “best time today,” a phrase that reflected effort, not ease.Behind the scenes, Mahomes is already focused on returning. His goals remain clear, even as medical caution shapes every step. “I want to be ready for Week 1,” Mahomes said. “The doctors said I could. But I can't predict what will happen throughout the process. That's the goal to play Week 1 and have no restrictions.“You want to be out there healthy and give us the best chance to win. I hope to do some things in OTAs and training camp and be able to do things there.”Outside voices have urged patience. Pro Football Talk’s Mike Florio has noted how late-season ACL injuries complicate timelines, especially for quarterbacks who rely on movement. Examples like Adrian Peterson offer hope, but Mahomes faces multiple ligament repairs in a modern recovery environment built around caution.For now, the Chiefs star heals quietly. Brittany keeps life bright. Together, they move forward one careful step at a time.","Patrick Mahomes tore his ACL and LCL late in the season.

Emma Raducanu, Eugenie Bouchard, and Marta Kostyuk react to Katie Boulter’s Australian Open look

Alex de Minaur did the winning on court, but off the court, it was his fiancée Katie Boulter who stole the spotlight at the 2026 Australian Open. After Alex de Minaur beat Frances Tiafoe in straight sets in the third round in Melbourne, fans were not just talking about his tennis. They were also talking about a glamorous photo shared by his fiancée, British tennis player Katie Boulter. She attended the match looking stylish and confident, and the photo quickly caught attention across the tennis world.What made it bigger was the reaction from famous players. Emma Raducanu, Eugenie Bouchard, and Marta Kostyuk all noticed the post and shared their love in the comments. One comment, in particular, went viral and sparked wide talk online. It compared Boulter’s look to Kate Middleton, the Princess of Wales. The moment mixed tennis, fashion, and personality, making it one of the most talked-about off-court moments of the Australian Open so far.On Saturday, January 24, a day after Alex de Minaur’s third-round win over Frances Tiafoe, Katie Boulter shared a photo on Instagram from the Australian Open. The 29-year-old British player looked elegant and relaxed as she supported her fiancé from the stands.Katie Boulter added a fun caption to the post. She wrote, “51% shareholder 😏.” The line was a playful response to former tennis star Jim Courier.

We are doing as much as we can together.” He added, “I’m sure when it comes to the details of napkins and flowers and decoration purposes, that’s not my forte. I’ll leave that to Katie.”On court, de Minaur kept moving forward. He beat Alexander Bublik in the fourth round to reach the quarterfinals. His next match will be tough, as he is set to face Carlos Alcaraz. De Minaur has lost all five of his past matches against the Spanish star.","Katie Boulter shared a glamorous photo of herself at the Australian Open.

The post captured a rare off field moment for Blake Snell and his family



Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Blake Snell may be navigating the intensity of another demanding MLB season, but his family recently offered fans a refreshing glimpse into life away from the spotlight. His wife, Haeley Snell, took to Instagram to share intimate vacation moments from Maui, featuring the couple and their children in a serene island setting.The photos reflected a calm, unhurried atmosphere, capturing the family dressed elegantly amid lush greenery and open skies. Paired with the caption, “phone on dnd,” the post subtly highlighted the value of disconnecting and being present. Fans quickly connected with the sentiment, responding warmly to a moment that felt genuine rather than staged.One of the main reasons why the Maui photos resonated was due to their simplicity. In one image, Blake and Haeley were standing together in a tropical background, whereas another image depicts the couple with their children, with a lot of emphasis on closeness and balance. The casual nature of the pictures was refreshing, a contrast to the stress that typically envelops the life of a star pitcher.The comments section was full of positive remarks about the family being warm and the calm surroundings.Some of the fans commented on how natural the scene was, enjoying a glimpse of Snell outside game days and stat lines.Out of social media, the continuity and development are still evident in the professional life of Snell. He was selected by the Tampa Bay Rays in the first round of 2011 MLB Draft and made his debut in Major league in 2016 and gradually became one of the most trusted left handed pitchers in the baseball game. His most successful year was 2018 as he won the American League Cy Young Award by topping the league in wins and earned run average.To further solidify his reputation, Snell was traded to the San Diego Padres before the 2021 season and won a second Cy Young Award in 2023. In 2024, he moved to the San Francisco Giants and made one of the highlights of the season by throwing a no hitter against Cincinnati Reds. In 2025, he joined the Los Angeles Dodgers on a five year contract and helped the club to win the World Series against the Toronto Blue Jays.The subtle Maui post by Haeley was a silent reminder to fans that despite milestones and championships, family time will remain ever relevant.","Blake Snell's wife, Haeley, took to Instagram to share intimate vacation moments from Maui.

Joe Rogan calls the injury trend ‘not normal’ while pointing to data dating back more than a decade

John Lynch confirms 49ers will look into the theory while stressing player safety comes first

Joe Rogan didn’t hedge his words this week when a long-running conspiracy theory around the San Francisco 49ers resurfaced on his podcast. The claim centers on an electrical substation located next to the team’s training facility and Levi’s Stadium, with some suggesting it may be contributing to the franchise’s unusually high injury rate.The conversation gained new weight after 49ers general manager John Lynch confirmed the organization plans to investigate the theory. While experts continue to dispute any medical link, the team has acknowledged the volume of injuries is a concern worth examining.Rogan addressed the topic on his podcast while speaking with guest Paul Rooslie, reacting to claims that electromagnetic fields near the facility could be affecting player health. He referenced discussions among players that reportedly began more than a decade ago.“The players started talking about all this in 2012, I believe,” Rogan said. “And people were like, ‘All that’s nonsense.’ Now, the stats are in, and you’re looking at the amount of injuries that come from this area, it’s like, this is not normal.”Rogan went further, arguing that the number and severity of injuries tied to the 49ers stand out compared to the rest of the league.“So, there’s a disproportionate amount of catastrophic injuries that come out of San Francisco and their training facility is right outside this power station,” he said.“Way more Achilles tendon blowouts, way more knees blown out, way more catastrophic ligament and tendon ruptures.”He emphasized that his focus was not on proving a conclusion, but on questioning whether the pattern warrants scrutiny.“Electricity,” Rogan said. “By the EMF signal. EMF signals we know disrupt human beings, but to what extent?”San Francisco has not endorsed the theory, but Lynch confirmed this week that the organization is taking it seriously enough to explore. Speaking to reporters, the general manager said the team cannot ignore claims tied to player health, even if they remain unproven.“Because it deals with, allegedly, the health and safety of our players, I think you have to look into everything,” Lynch said.“We’ve been reaching out to anyone and everyone to see, does a study exist other than a guy sticking an apparatus underneath the fence and coming up with a number that I have no idea what that means?”Lynch also acknowledged skepticism surrounding the theory while making clear the team will not dismiss it outright.“We’ve heard that debunked,” he said. “The health and safety of our players is of the utmost priority. We aren’t going to turn a blind eye.”The renewed attention comes after an injury-heavy 2025 season for San Francisco. Fred Warner, Nick Bosa, George Kittle, and Brock Purdy were among the notable players who missed time. The 49ers reached the playoffs, defeated the Philadelphia Eagles in the wild-card round, then suffered a 41-6 loss to the Seattle Seahawks in the divisional round.",The San Francisco 49ers have been linked to an electrical substation near their training facility and Levi’s Stadium.

Jordan’s $75 million bet on Zion Williamson

Zion Williamson in the 2025-26 NBA season

The Jumpman is officially moving on. In a move that has sent shockwaves through the sneaker world and NBA Twitter alike, Jordan Brand is reportedly discontinuing Zion Williamson’s signature shoe line. The Zion 4, which hit shelves in early 2025, will serve as the final chapter of a partnership that once felt like a guaranteed dynasty.While Zion remains on the Jordan roster for now, the sunsetting of his line marks a massive pivot for a brand that once bet the house on the Duke phenom. For fans who remember the sheer hype of 2019, this isn't just a business decision, it’s the end of one of the most polarizing eras in modern sports marketing.To understand how things got here, one needs to take a look back at the absolute frenzy surrounding Zion’s entry into the league. He was drafted as the #1 overpick in 2019 by the New Orleans Pelicans over Ja Morant. But before he even played a single second of NBA basketball, Williamson signed a monster 7-year, $75 million deal with Jordan Brand in July of 2019. It was the second-largest rookie shoe contract in history, behind LeBron James’ legendary $90 million deal in 2003.The hype generated alongside the #1 draft pick and monstrous rookie deal with Jordan was undeniable. Zion was seen as the Chosen One for a new generation of NBA players due to his size, skill, and athleticism. He was supposed to carry the Jumpman torch into the future.However, the journey has been anything but smooth. From the infamous exploding shoe incident at Duke to a series of high-profile injuries that kept him off the court for nearly half of his career games, the Zion effect struggled to translate into consistent retail success. While Jayson Tatum and Luka Doncic have seen their signature lines flourish, Zion’s sneakers, despite cool collaborations like thepack, never quite captured the mainstream imagination the way Jordan Brand expected.On the court, Zion Williamson’s 2025-26 story tells a different story in itself. Currently, Zion is putting up a solid 22.0 points, 6.0 rebounds, and 3.4 assists per game while shooting nearly 58% from the field. When he is healthy, he remains an absolute bulldozer in the paint, recently coming off a dominant 24-point, 10-rebound performance with 10-18 from the field against Spurs and helped Pelicans to win by 104-95.However, the injuries continue to haunt him. Zion has already missed 16 games this season due to a mix of hamstring issues and recent illness. While his scoring remains elite, the Pelicans have struggled with consistency, sitting at the bottom of the Western Conference standings with a 12-36 record.","The Zion 4, which hit shelves in early 2025, will serve as the final chapter of a partnership that once felt like a guaranteed dynasty.

Cooper Kupp finds strength in family as Seahawks journey turns personal



Cooper Kupp stood at the center of one of the most emotional Sundays of the NFL season, carrying history, heartbreak, and hope into a championship stage. Once celebrated as the face of a Super Bowl comeback in Los Angeles, the veteran wide receiver now wears different colors with the same quiet fire. The moment felt heavy and personal, shaped not just by football, but by family, loyalty, and a career that refuses to slow down.At 32, Kupp understands how quickly the league moves on. The Rams chose not to meet his expectations in free agency, closing a chapter that included a Super Bowl MVP and countless clutch catches. Seattle did not hesitate. A three year, $45 million deal with $17.5 million guaranteed gave him a fresh start, and it placed him face to face with the past sooner than anyone expected.The NFC Championship Game against Los Angeles Rams was more than a playoff clash. It was a collision of memories. Cooper Kupp embraced former teammates Matthew Stafford and Puka Nacua before kickoff, sharing smiles that hinted at mutual respect and unfinished emotions. Then he turned toward the stands, where his true support system waited.Anna Marie Kupp and their three sons made their presence impossible to miss.Cooper Jameson, born in 2018, Cypress Stellar, born in 2021, and Solas Reign, born in 2023, proudly wore Seahawks gear and Kupp jerseys. Anna added a custom “10” coat, blending style with meaning. The image spoke louder than words. This was a family fully committed to the next chapter.Their bond has deep roots. Cooper and Anna met as teenagers at a high school track meet in Washington, when she handed him a medal after a race. He has often described that moment as love at first sight. They married in 2015, long before the bright lights of Super Bowls and free agency drama.In a June 2022 conversation with PEOPLE, Kupp described his wife as the ""absolute warrior"" of their family. That strength has carried them through relocations, injuries, and now a rivalry that feels personal. Anna once shared a heartfelt note about moving back to the Pacific Northwest, a return that felt both emotional and empowering.For Cooper Kupp, revenge is not loud. It lives in preparation, precision, and purpose. Surrounded by family and fueled by unfinished business, he stepped onto the field not just to beat his former team, but to honor the journey that brought him there.","Cooper Kupp signed a three year, $45 million deal with $17.5 million guaranteed with the Seattle Seahawks.

Los Angeles Lakers vs Chicago Bulls Game Outlook

The Los Angeles Lakers visit Chicago on January 26 to face the Bulls in a game shaped by injuries, travel problems, and recent form. A winter storm has complicated travel, and both teams arrive short-handed. The Lakers are 27–17 and coming off a 116–110 win over Dallas. The Bulls are 23–22 and have won four straight.Los Angeles is trying to build consistency after an uneven stretch. Chicago is doing the opposite, using strong home performances to stay competitive in the East. With key players missing on both sides, this matchup is likely to come down to who handles limited rotations better.Injuries will play a major role in how this game unfolds.Austin Reaves is out with a calf strain, leaving a gap in the Lakers’ guard rotation. Adou Thiero is also out with a right MCL sprain, further reducing frontcourt depth. Jake LaRavia is questionable due to a left quad contusion and illness after scoring 13 points in his last game. If LaRavia does not play, the Lakers will lean even more on Luka Doncic to run the offense and log heavy minutes.Chicago Bulls will be without Tre Jones, who is sidelined with a left hamstring strain.Zach Collins is also out with a right first toe sprain, weakening the Bulls’ interior depth. Noa Essengue remains a long-term absence as he continues recovery from shoulder surgery. Yuki Kawhi and Emanuel Miller are unavailable due to G-League rules.With those players out, Chicago will lean on Nikola Vučević, who is putting up 18.3 points and nine rebounds per game, and Matas Buzelis, who is averaging 16.5 points and giving the team reliable shooting from the outside.This is the first meeting between the teams this season. The Los Angeles Lakers have had a slight edge in recent years, but games in Chicago have often been close. Vucevic has been effective against Los Angeles in past matchups, while Doncic’s passing and shot creation could test a thin Bulls backcourt.Chicago will look to play through Vucevic inside and create clean looks for Buzelis on the perimeter. Los Angeles will depend on Doncic to control the game and manage late possessions. With both teams missing rotation players and scoring well recently, the game projects to be close and relatively high scoring, with execution and depth likely deciding the result.","The Los Angeles Lakers visit Chicago on January 26 to face the Bulls.

What to Watch Charlotte Hornets vs Philadelphia 76ers (January 26, 2026)

’s availability remains the main question as theget set to face the Philadelphia 76ers on January 26. He has been dealing with a right thumb contusion, but there is no official indication that he will sit out. As of the latest injury updates, Ball has not been ruled out, and the expectation around the team is that he is pushing to play.Charlotte’s lineup has often looked different with and without Ball on the floor, which makes his status important for this matchup. Philadelphia is also navigating injuries of its own, adding another layer of uncertainty to how the game could unfold.LaMelo Ball is not listed as out on the Hornets’ most recent injury report. The thumb issue surfaced recently, but Ball has already played through it. He was previously listed as questionable for an earlier game and still took the floor, suggesting the injury is being managed rather than worsening.There have been no reports of setbacks specific to January 26, and Ball is also not included alongside other injured Hornets, such as KJ Simpson. That absence from the report points toward availability, though a final call is expected closer to tip-off.The Charlotte Hornets will host the Philadelphia 76ers in an Eastern Conference matchup that could shift based on who is available. Philadelphia will be without Joel Embiid, who is sitting out due to ankle injury management on the second night of a back-to-back.Charlotte also has uncertainty elsewhere. Collin Sexton is a game-time decision because of a hamstring issue, which could further increase Ball’s role if he plays.Ball first dealt with the thumb contusion after coming off the bench against Cleveland. Despite the issue, he logged minutes and remained productive. He later played through a questionable designation and scored efficiently, showing no major limitations.Since then, there have been no new concerns tied to the thumb. His continued presence in games suggests the Hornets’ staff is comfortable with his condition.This season, LaMelo Ball is averaging 19.3 points, 4.2 rebounds, and 7 assists. Those numbers reflect his role as the primary ball handler and creator for Charlotte. Against Philadelphia, he has been consistent, averaging 19.1 points and 7.1 assists across eight career games. That stretch includes a 38-point performance in November 2024.Support from Brandon Miller and Miles Bridges gives Charlotte additional scoring options if Ball is available.If Ball plays, Charlotte gains stability and playmaking, especially with Philadelphia missing key pieces. His shooting has held up despite the thumb issue, including a recent strong performance from three-point range.Also read: Is Joel Embiid playing tonight vs the Charlotte Hornets?

NHL reviewing incident after William Nylander apologizes for on-camera gesture



Toronto Maple Leafs forward William Nylander found himself at the center of unwanted attention Sunday, not for his on-ice production, but for a brief off-ice moment that quickly went viral. During Toronto’s 4-1 home loss to the Colorado Avalanche, a camera shot caught Nylander making an obscene gesture while watching from the stands.The incident came at a difficult time for both player and team. Already sidelined with injury and amid a rough stretch for the Maple Leafs, Nylander’s actions sparked scrutiny across the hockey world and prompted a public apology soon after the final horn.Nylander addressed the situation directly on Instagram, calling the incident a “moment of frustration” and emphasizing that no offense was intended toward Leafs Nation. “Only love for Leafs Nation. Sorry about my moment of frustration today! Didn’t mean to upset anyone. Looking forward to being back on the ice and not in the stands. Love Willy,” the Maple Leafs forward wrote following Sunday’s 4-1 loss.The apology was swift and measured, aimed at cooling a situation that escalated quickly once the clip aired. Still, the matter may not end there, as TSN Hockey Insider Chris Johnston reported that the NHL is reviewing the incident, leaving open the possibility of league discipline.The gesture occurred early in the third period with Toronto trailing 3-0. Nylander, who has been out with a groin injury, was seated in a suite alongside teammates Chris Tanev, Dakota Joshua, Calle Jarnkrok, and Philippe Myers. As the camera briefly focused on the group, Nylander flashed the middle finger before the feed returned to the ice. The moment was short, but its impact lingered.Context matters here, including Sunday’s game. Nylander has missed five straight contests due to injury, forced to watch as Toronto dropped its fourth consecutive home game and sixth loss in seven outings. Frustration has been evident around the club, and this was another reminder of how quickly emotions can spill over during a difficult stretch.From a hockey standpoint, Nylander’s absence is significant. He has been one of Toronto’s most consistent offensive contributors this season, posting 17 goals and 31 assists for 48 points in 37 games while averaging 18:33 of ice time. His production has been difficult to replace, particularly as the Leafs struggle to find rhythm at even strength.Toronto now sits at 24-19-9 and faces mounting pressure heading into a busy stretch. The Maple Leafs return to action Tuesday against the Buffalo Sabres before embarking on a six-game road trip that could shape their season. Whether Nylander faces additional consequences remains to be seen, but his focus, and the team’s, will be on getting healthy, stabilizing their play, and keeping distractions to a minimum.",NHL reviewing incident after William Nylander apologizes for on-camera gesture.

Bangladesh cricket in turmoil: What it means for the T20 World Cup?

Why Tilak Varma will miss T20Is vs New Zealand | Comeback date revealed | T20 World Cup

Poll Do you agree with cricket Scotland's replacement of Bangladesh in the ICC Men's T20 World Cup? Yes, they deserve the opportunity No, Bangladesh should have participated

NEW DELHI: Cricket Scotland chief executive Trudy Lindblade has expressed sympathy for Bangladesh after the International Cricket Council (ICC) confirmed Scotland as their replacement for the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2026, while admitting the circumstances of their qualification were far from ideal.“We certainly have (sympathy) for the Bangladesh team,” Lindblade said, as quoted by ESPNcricinfo, after the ICC removed Bangladesh from the tournament scheduled to be played from February 7 to March 8 in Sri Lanka and India.“Obviously, this is not how we wanted to go to a World Cup. There is a qualification process, and nobody wants to qualify or attend or be invited to a World Cup in the way that we have done. We acknowledge it is certainly unique circumstances by our participation, and we do feel for the Bangladesh players,” she added.Bangladesh were removed from the 20-team event after the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) refused to participate under the published match schedule. The ICC rejected the BCB’s request to move Bangladesh’s matches from India to Sri Lanka, stating there was no credible or verifiable security threat to the Bangladesh national team in India.Responding to criticism around Scotland’s inclusion, Lindblade struck a measured tone. “I wouldn't use those words. People will have their views, and they are entitled to their views,” she said. “All we know is that we have been invited to participate in the World Cup. We are a team that is ranked 14th in the world. We are also a strong team that plays consistently throughout the year.”Reflecting on Scotland’s failed qualification campaign, she added, “That World Cup [qualifier] for us was not how we normally play, and therefore we are just pleased to be at this World Cup. We are happy to step in, although it is unique and challenging circumstances, and we absolutely recognise that.”In its official release, the ICC said it undertook an extensive process over more than three weeks to address BCB’s concerns, including multiple rounds of dialogue, independent security assessments, and sharing detailed federal and state-level security plans. After the BCB failed to confirm participation, the ICC moved to identify a replacement in line with governance and qualification processes.Scotland, ranked 14th in T20Is, are the highest-ranked team not to have originally qualified, sitting above seven teams already in the tournament, and will now take their place on the world stage.","Cricket Scotland chief executive Trudy Lindblade has expressed sympathy for Bangladesh after the ICC confirmed Scotland as their replacement for the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2026.

BCCI sends a stern message to Mohsin Naqvi over Asia Cup trophy row

NEW DELHI: Pakistan on Monday said it will delay a decision on its participation in the upcoming ICC Men’s T20 World Cup, keeping the matter open until at least Friday, amid discussions on a possible boycott of the match against co-hosts India in support of Bangladesh, who have been removed from the tournament.The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said a final decision will be taken either on Friday or next Monday after the board chairman Mohsin Naqvi met Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in Islamabad.Naqvi, who is also the country's interior minister, later confirmed on social media that the issue was discussed in detail during the meeting with the Prime Minister.""I had a productive meeting with the Prime Minister and briefed him on the ICC matter.

The ICC said there was no verifiable threat.Pakistan are set to begin their T20 World Cup campaign against the Netherlands on February 7 in Colombo. They are also scheduled to play the USA on February 10, India on February 15 and Namibia on February 18.The PCB announced its 15-member squad on Sunday.

NEW DELHI: World No.1 women's tennis player Aryna Sabalenka produced another milestone moment at the Australian Open on Sunday, and in the process, she broke a Grand Slam record previously held by legend Novak Djokovic By dominating yet another tiebreak, Sabalenka claimed her 20th consecutive tiebreak win at Grand Slam events, moving past Djokovic’s mark of 19 and becoming the outright leader in the Open Era.The achievement quickly drew a reaction from Djokovic himself, who responded publicly and with humour.While acknowledging Sabalenka’s remarkable consistency under pressure, the Serbian star joked about losing the record, writing on X, “I’m upset right now.”His light-hearted comment highlighted the significance of the moment and showed respect for Sabalenka’s growing place in tennis history.Sabalenka reached the quarterfinals after a straight-sets victory over Canada’s Victoria Mboko, winning her Round of 16 match 6-1, 7-6 (1) on Sunday.Although Mboko is just 19 years old and seeded No. 17, Sabalenka took control early and set the tone with powerful serving and aggressive shot-making.She hit three aces in the opening set, controlled the rallies, and broke serve quickly. She wrapped up the set in only 31 minutes while looking calm and confident throughout.The second set proved more challenging, as the Belarusian made more unforced errors and Mboko lifted her level.Mboko chased every ball and played with belief, pushing Sabalenka and forcing longer rallies.Sabalenka built a 4-1 lead and later served at 5-4, but she missed three match points, allowing Mboko to gain momentum and force a tiebreak.However, once the match reached the tiebreak, Sabalenka’s dominance returned. She took control from the start, closed it out with ease, and sealed the record-breaking win.Sabalenka’s success in Melbourne has been consistent. She won the Australian Open in 2023 and defended her title in 2024 after finishing runner-up the year before, and she has also captured two US Open titles.","World No.1 Aryna Sabalenka breaks Novak Djokovic's Grand Slam tiebreak record.

Chennai Super Kings (CSK) IPL trade, retentions and releases: Why the Yellow Army is in a deep mess!

MS Dhoni has begun batting practice ahead of the upcoming Indian Premier League (IPL) season, with Chennai Super Kings (CSK) sharing a video of the session on social media.The official CSK Instagram handle posted visuals of the 44-year-old working on his defence and back-foot shots. The post was captioned: ""A treat, every time he bats. Superfans, you know what time it is. ""Despite skipper Ruturaj Gaikwad being in strong form in domestic cricket, CSK continue to have Dhoni as their marquee player as they look to target a sixth IPL title. The franchise has won the tournament five times.CSK finished last in the previous season, managing four wins from 14 matches. Dhoni had a modest campaign, scoring 196 runs in 13 innings at an average of 24.50 and a strike rate of 135.17, with a top score of 30 not out. He also led the side in matches where Gaikwad was unavailable due to injury.With wicketkeeper-batter Sanju Samson joining CSK through a trade with Rajasthan Royals, Dhoni’s role and future have come under focus. Fans will be watching closely to see if he can make a stronger impact after a difficult 2025 season.Dhoni remains one of the leading run-scorers in IPL history. He has made 5,439 runs in 278 matches and 242 innings at an average of 38.80, with a strike rate of 137.45.His tally includes 24 half-centuries, with a highest score of 84 not out.CSK also saw positives last season with the rise of young players Dewald Brevis, Ayush Mhatre and Urvil Patel. Ahead of the new season, the franchise made two major purchases, signing Uttar Pradesh all-rounder Prashant Veer and Rajasthan wicketkeeper Kartik Sharma for Rs 14.20 crore each, making them the most expensive uncapped players in IPL history.","MS Dhoni has begun batting practice ahead of the upcoming Indian Premier League (IPL) season.

Poll Do you believe Pakistan is interfering in Bangladesh's decision regarding the T20 World Cup? Yes, definitely No, not really

NEW DELHI: BCCI vice-president Rajeev Shukla has accused Pakistan of misleading Bangladesh over security concerns that ultimately led to Dhaka’s refusal to play its ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2026 matches in India, triggering Scotland’s late inclusion in the tournament.Speaking to ANI, Shukla said Bangladesh had been assured of full security and that its concerns were addressed, but the situation was aggravated by outside interference. “We wanted Bangladesh to play, and we also assured full security, but since they have made this decision, it is very difficult to change the entire schedule at the last moment. This is why Scotland was brought in,” Shukla said.He was far more direct while referring to Pakistan’s role in the episode. “Pakistan is intervening in the matter without any reason and provoking Bangladesh. Everyone knows the brutality done by Pakistan on the Bangladeshis, and now they are trying to mislead them, which is completely wrong,” he added.The comments come amid uncertainty over Pakistan’s own participation in the T20 World Cup, to be co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka from February 7 to March 8.Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman and Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi had earlier indicated that Islamabad could rethink its participation following Bangladesh’s withdrawal from matches in India.According to Dawn News, Naqvi suggested Pakistan could reconsider playing in the tournament, a stance he later followed up by delaying a final decision. On Monday, Naqvi said a call on Pakistan’s participation would be deferred by up to a week. After meeting Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif, Naqvi described it as a “productive meeting” and said the premier had “directed that we resolve it while keeping all options on the table”. He later posted on X that the final decision would be taken “either on Friday or next Monday”.Despite the uncertainty, Pakistan announced a 15-member squad for the World Cup a day after Naqvi’s initial remarks, even as local media reported that the PCB was also considering boycotting a February 15 clash against arch-rivals India due to political tensions.Pakistan backed Bangladesh during an ICC Board meeting, citing last year’s Champions Trophy precedent where India played their matches in Dubai due to security concerns in Pakistan. However, the ICC stood firm, prioritising the integrity of the tournament schedule.",BCCI vice-president Rajeev Shukla accuses Pakistan of misleading Bangladesh over security concerns that ultimately led to Dhaka’s refusal to play its T20 World Cup 2026 matches in India.

Ravi Bishnoi press conference: on reading conditions, bowling plans & staying focussed

GUWAHATI: With India’s spin department already well stocked in limited-overs cricket, opportunities are few and far between. Out of the reckoning for about a year, Ravi Bishnoi was drafted in as Washington Sundar ’s replacement for the T20I series against New Zealand.His inclusion in the XI — in place of Varun Chakravarthy — for Sunday’s third T20I here surprised many. But Bishnoi, who last played for India in the five-match T20I series against England in Feb 2025, delivered despite admitting to “butterflies” in his comeback game.“For the opportunity I got today, I was a little nervous. I was also excited because I got the opportunity (after a long time). But at the same time, there was nervousness as well. You get one opportunity and you have to perform in that. So, there was both nervous energy and excitement,” a visibly happy Bishnoi said.The Rajasthan-born legspinner came on as first change bowler in the fifth over and returned impressive figures of 4-0-18-2. He bowled his four overs in four separate spells but his pace and accuracy stood out. He dismissed the dangerous Mark Chapman (32) and Glenn Phillips (48) to choke New Zealand in the middle overs.“I tried my best to bowl in the five-six metres length on the stumps, as it is difficult to hit from those lengths. So, I tried my best to bowl at a good length. If the ball falls at that length at that speed, it is very difficult to hit.“I bowl according to the rhythm of my body. It’s not that I have to bowl more than 100 kmph or less than 100 kmph every time. I bowl the way I feel on a given day,” explained the former Lucknow Super Giants bowler.Bishnoi did not have a great IPL season in 2025, managing nine wickets in 11 games, and was released by Lucknow. He got a fresh lease of life when Rajasthan Royals bought him at the 2026 auction. “The work I have done in the last one year was on my lengths because I didn’t do so well in the IPL last season. I didn’t have much control over my lengths and my lines in the last season. That’s why it was tough for me,” he said.“Yes, it is difficult when you are away from the side. This Indian team is very strong and there are very few spots available, so limited opportunities. It was good (the time away from the national team) because I had time to work on myself, I did a lot of work on myself,” he added, pointing to his domestic form — nine wickets in seven matches in the 2025–26 Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy. “All those things helped me a lot to make a comeback. ”",Ravi Bishnoi was drafted in as Washington Sundar ’s replacement for the T20I series against New Zealand.

MUMBAI: Cameras equipped with facial recognition tech have helped Government Railway Police track down the suspected killer of a city college teacher in around 12 hours after the murder. The victim, Alok Kumar Singh (33), was stabbed to death after a fight on a local train at Malad station on Saturday evening.The 27-year-old suspect, Omkar Shinde, told police that he lost his cool after a tiff with Singh over alighting at the station. Shinde, who is into imitation jewellery and metal polishing, is believed to have used a small pair of tongs to stab Singh. He threw away the weapon while fleeing. Police are looking for it.Singh and his colleague S K Trivedi were heading home in a Borivli-bound slow local when the former was stabbed at the door of the coach. ""We may have scanned footage from close to 200 cameras in the span of a night,"" a Borivli GRP officer said. The GRP worked with Railway Protection Force and city police to track down the suspect.Explaining the sequence of events after the stabbing of the junior college teacher, police said Shinde ran on platform no.1 and climbed a foot overbridge. Cameras captured him exiting the railway premises towards Malad (E) a minute later.""We wanted to check if the suspect was a frequent railway commuter and started looking through surveillance footage from five days before the incident,"" a GRP officer said. Around 5-6 teams were formed. Logs were maintained for dates and timings that Shinde was captured on cameras, equipped with facial recognition tech, entering or exiting railway premises.""Shinde would typically board the 7.18am Up local from Malad and after work, he took board the 4.16pm local from Charni Road to head home,"" said another officer. Surveillance footage from outside Malad railway station showed that Shinde preferred walking home in the evening. But in the morning, he would take an auto to reach the station.After studying these patterns, investigators set up a trap at the auto stand outside Malad station around 7am on Sunday. ""We were not too sure if he would go to work as it was a Sunday. But we saw him getting off an auto,"" said an officer. The team pounced on Shinde and brought him to the Borivli GRP chowky. He initially claimed he wasn't aware of Singh's death. Shinde resides at Kurar village in Malad with his parents and a brother. He works at his father's metal polishing unit in Khetwadi, besides doing some imitation jewellery work on his own. Police said his father is a heart patient and has stopped working.On Sunday, Shinde was produced before a holiday court at Borivli which sent him to police custody till Jan 29. Police said he does not have a prior criminal record.","Alok Kumar Singh (33) was stabbed to death after a fight on a local train at Malad station on Saturday evening.

NEW DELHI: The 'He-Man' of Indian cinema, Dharmendra, and CPM stalwart V S Achuthanandhan were on Sunday named, both posthumously, as recipients of Padma Vibhushan, with the govt bestowing the Padma awards on 131 people - some celebrated like cricketers Rohit Sharma and Harmanpreet Kaur and actor Mammootty while several others were recognised for their impactful service away from the public glare.Former SC judge K T Thomas, journalist and author P Narayanan, who has been associated with RSS, are two other recipients of the second-highest civilian honour from Kerala, while violin maestro N Rajam from UP is another awardee in this category this year. The govt named 13 people for Padma Bhushan, including singer Alka Yagnik, celebrated late adman Piyush Pandey, industrialist Uday Kotak and the late former Jharkhand CM Shibu Soren. Like last year, no one was named for Bharat Ratna, the highest award. Congratulating the winners, PM Modi said, ""Their excellence, dedication and service across diverse fields enrich the fabric of our society. The honour reflects the spirit of commitment and excellence that continues to inspire generations.In keeping with its practice of taking the Padma awards' focus away from big cities and well-known names and to recognise hinterland talents in a wide spectrum of fields, the Modi govt picked this year's awardees from 84 districts spread across 30 states and UTs.Ten districts figure on the list for the first time since Independence, officials noted.Among such ""unsung heroes"", as officials described them, are Taga Ram Bheel, recognised for reviving Rajasthan's fading folk instrument Algoza, and Meghalaya-based environmentalist Hally War.Former Indian tennis star Vijay Amritraj, based in the US, is among the six Padma Bhushan awardees under foreigners/NRI/PIO/OCI.A maximum 15 winners are officially from Maharashtra, including the likes of actors Dharmendra and R Madhavan - one of the key characters in 'Dhurandhar', said to have been inspired by NSA Ajit Doval - who found their calling in the state, followed by 13 from Tamil Nadu and 11 each from West Bengal and UP. Eight each are from Karnataka and Kerala, including Vellappally Natesan, a functionary of SNDP - an outfit that has positioned itself as the vehicle of Izhavas, the single most numerically preponderant caste in Kerala - and a BJP ally in Tamil Nadu.Tamil Nadu, West Bengal and Kerala are heading to assembly polls, though official sources were quick to point out that govt has annually tried to give a diverse representation regionally, selecting the awardees from 84 districts across the country.Former IPS officer K Vijay Kumar, associated with the killing of notorious sandalwood smuggler Veerappan, Armind Fernandez, who established Asia's first human milk bank, and ex-Prasar Bharati CEO Shashi Shekhar Vempati, hockey player Savita Punia are among the other Padma winners besides politicians Bhagat Singh Kosher and late V K Malhotra, both from BJP.Achuthanandhan, a vocal and popular former Kerala CM, and Soren join other veteran politicians from non-BJP backgrounds like Mulayam Singh Yadav and Ram Vilas Paswan who got Padma recognition from this govt.Padma Shri awardees include former MHA functionary R V Mani, who had protested against a change of affidavit in the Ishrat Jehan encounter case. In his book, 'Hindu Terror: Insider account of Ministry of Home Affairs 2006-2010', Mani alleged he was pressured by the UPA govt to sign a second affidavit that fabricated a narrative of ""Saffron Terror"".Officials said govt made extensive efforts to identify achievers from all corners, highlighting that over 39,000 nominations were received and evaluated through an exhaustive and rigorous process of multiple rounds of scrutiny and consultation with ministry, state administration and domain experts. Awardees included 48 super senior citizens (80 years and above) and many from traditionally deprived sections of society.","Dharmendra and V S Achuthanandhan named posthumously as recipients of Padma Vibhushan.

Boon finished with 19 goals – the highest in the tournament – but he would be disappointed for failing to score more on the day.Lancers drew first blood from a retaken penalty corner after Angad Bir Singh won the set-piece and Hendrickx powered his drag-flick low to the goalkeeper’s left. Suraj Karkera got a stick on it but could not keep it out. The Royals hit back within five minutes. Yashdeep Siwach’s aerial from the left found Hundal on the right inside the circle; the forward brought it down under pressure and squeezed a finish past Krishan Bahadur Pathak at the near post, who should have done better.But the second quarter belonged to the hosts as they upped the tempo and grabbed two more goals from the penalty corners. Karkera’s initial save off Hendrickx spilled into danger and Dilpreet reacted quickest to stab home the rebound to make it 2-1.Two minutes later, Hendrickx unleashed another fierce drag-flick, threading it beyond the right-post defender to restore the two-goal cushion. Ranchi pushed hard after the break, with Boon — the tournament’s top scorer with 19 goals — leading the charge. Yet the Lancers’ defence held firm until the final two minutes, when Boon converted a late penalty corner to cut the deficit.Earlier, Hyderabad Toofans secured third place with a 4-3 win over HIL GC.

Ravi Bishnoi press conference: on reading conditions, bowling plans & staying focussed

Poll Do you think Bumrah should bowl with the new ball more often? Yes, absolutely Maybe, depending on the situation No, I prefer him in the death overs

GUWAHATI: If flexi-cap mutual funds delivered returns like Jasprit Bumrah , they wouldn’t need that familiar fine print about ‘market risk’. In a format where even good balls can disappear over the ropes, Bumrah offers something rarer than pace and swing — certainty.T20 is built on volatility: take wickets, leak runs, bowl tight, miss breakthroughs. Bumrah keeps breaking that trade-off. Whether he is asked to attack up front, disrupt in the middle or shut the door at the death, he gives India’s captains the same thing — dot balls, wickets and control, often all in the same over.Captain Suryakumar Yadav has largely held Bumrah back in this five-match series against New Zealand, using him as a middle-overs enforcer and a death-overs closer rather than a new-ball specialist. It hasn’t dulled the impact one bit.Rested for the second T20I, Bumrah was brought on in the final over of the powerplay in Sunday’s third game here at the Barsapara Cricket Stadium. Harshit Rana and Hardik Pandya shared the new ball, Ravi Bishnoi slipped in an over. Then Bumrah arrived — and struck immediately. First ball, Tim Seifert’s offstump was uprooted.Bumrah angled one in from over the wicket, hit a hard length and beat the opener for pace and movement.Rana and Pandya had already removed Devon Conway and Rachin Ravindra early but Bumrah — with Bishnoi squeezing in tandem — ensured New Zealand never rebuilt. Bumrah finished with his familiar miserly figures of 4-0-17-3 to earn Player of the Match as New Zealand were restricted to 153/9.“I was keeping an eye when Harshit and Hardik bowled, what is the best option over here (on this pitch). Obviously when I came on, the ball had become a little scuffed up,” Bumrah said at the presentation. “Usually, the white ball doesn’t swing for long. So it was about using my best option.”His spell was a study in authority. He bowled the sixth over to finish the powerplay, returned in the 11th to keep the squeeze on and then cleaned up the back end. Kyle Jamieson was bowled in his 18th-over burst, Bumrah was involved in the run-out of Matt Henry soon after and he came back in the final over to have Mitchell Santner picked out in the deep.Asked if he was enjoying being used away from his customary new-ball role, Bumrah sounded perfectly at home with the shifting brief. “I’m happy as far as I’m able to contribute. So if the team wants me to bowl with the new ball, I’m more than happy. If they want me to bowl in the end, I’m happy to do that (too),” he said, stressing that flexibility is non-negotiable in modern T20 cricket.The night also carried personal weight. Bumrah has completed 10 years in international cricket, a milestone he spoke about with a touch of emotion.“I, as a child, only dreamt to play one game. Ten years playing for your country, being a pure fast bowler, fighting aches and pains, assumptions, opinions,” he said. “People gave me six months. It’s a feather in my cap (playing for 10 years) and I’ll keep it with me.”","Jasprit Bumrah was named Player of the Match in the third T20I against New Zealand in Guwahati.

Jay Shah’s 2036 Olympic blueprint for India: '8 Medals won’t cut it'

NEW DELHI: Men’s doubles shuttler Krishna Prasad Garaga, who was part of the country’s Thomas Cup gold-winning campaign in 2022, will be donning the India jersey again after the National Anti-Doping Agency’s (NADA) appeal panel lifted his four-year ban period with immediate effect after exonerating him of drugrelated charges.The 25-year-old from Andhra Pradesh’s Kakinada was allowed to return to the competition arena effective Jan 18, 2026, following the anti-doping appeal panel’s decision to set aside his period of ineligibility, which was imposed on Nov 6, 2024. Garaga, incidentally, was the men’s doubles champion at the 2019 South Asian Games.Garaga’s lawyers argued that Nada failed to comply with mandatory procedural safeguards, which said that under Wada’s technical rules, an adverse analytical finding (AAF) for HCG in a male athlete must trigger a comprehensive clinical investigation to rule out pathological causes. The lawyers contended that “exogenous administration is pharmacokinetically impossible since injected HCG would have cleared the system within days”.Nada’s legal team argued that under the principle of strict liability, the burden of proof shifts to the athlete. However, the appeal panel ruled in its order: “The panel finds that the scientific and biochemical evidence on record does not establish, to the requisite standard of comfortable satisfaction, that the HCG detected in the athlete’s sample originated from exogenous administration.Accordingly, the athlete is exonerated. ”Nada officers called for cross-examinationIn another development, a separate appeal panel has ordered the cross-examination of Nada’s dope control officer Pawan Kumar and chaperones Kirti and Mukul in Olympic medallist wrestler Bajrang Punia’s case.The case involved Punia’s refusal to give his urine sample during the national selection trials on March 10, 2024, following disputes over testing protocols.He was banned for four years by Nada’s disciplinary panel on Nov 26, 2024.","Krishna Prasad Garaga's four-year ban period lifted with immediate effect.

Stonehenge mystery solved? Study reveals how 25-tonne stones reached the site in southern England,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/stonehenge-mystery-solved-study-reveals-how-25-tonne-stones-reached-the-site-in-southern-england/articleshow/127561744.cms,"

Researchers uncovered the truth behind Stonehenge’s 25 tonne stones

Salisbury Plain shows no sign of ancient ice

Sarsens were local but still demanding

Bluestones point clearly to human effort

What the science changes and what it does not





Stonehenge sits on open chalk land in southern England, familiar and yet still awkwardly unexplained. For decades, one practical question has hovered over the site without settling. How did stones weighing many tonnes arrive here long before wheels, metal tools or written plans. A new study led by geologists at Curtin University shifts that discussion onto firmer ground. By analysing tiny mineral grains in local river sediments, the researchers tested whether glaciers once carried the stones south during the Ice Age. The results point away from ice and towards people. The landscape around Salisbury Plain shows no chemical trace of glacial delivery. Instead, the sediments reflect local recycling. This strengthens the view that Neolithic communities moved the stones themselves, deliberately, over long distances alone.The research “Detrital zircon–apatite fingerprinting challenges glacial transport of Stonehenge’s megaliths” focuses on detrital minerals, mainly zircon and apatite, found in streams that drain Salisbury Plain. These grains act as long-lived markers of where sediment has travelled. If glaciers had crossed the area, they would likely have left behind mineral signatures from Wales or northern Britain.That signal is absent. The zircon ages instead match rocks already known from southern England, suggesting the material has been recycled locally rather than dumped by ice. This matters because glacial transport has often been used as a convenient explanation. If ice sheets had carried the stones close to Stonehenge, human effort could be seen as minimal. The new data makes that position harder to hold.The study also reinforces a growing consensus among geomorphologists. There is little physical evidence that glaciers ever reached Salisbury Plain during the Pleistocene. No clear moraines, no consistent erratic trails, no buried till layers. While ice did extend far into Britain during earlier cold periods, its southern limits remain well north of the monument.Fine sediments can travel far beyond glaciers through meltwater. Large stones usually do not. The absence of glacial fingerprints in the surrounding sediment makes it unlikely that multi-tonne blocks arrived by chance.Not all of Stonehenge came from far away. The largest stones, the sarsens, were sourced from West Woods, about 25 kilometres to the north. That distance may sound modest, but the stones weigh around 25 tonnes each. Moving them would still have required planning, labour and time. The mineral analysis does not focus on sarsens directly, but it supports a broader pattern. Stonehenge was not constructed using random materials that happened to be located nearby. Its materials were selected and brought in with intent.The smaller bluestones tell a sharper story. Their geological fingerprints match outcrops in the Preseli Hills of west Wales, around 230 kilometres away. Some stones may have travelled by sea for part of that journey, others overland. Either way, the distances involved rule out casual movement. One stone stands out even more. The Altar Stone appears to come from the Orcadian Basin in northeast Scotland. If correct, that implies a journey of more than 700 kilometres. No known ice route explains this. Human organisation does.The study does not describe exactly how the stones were moved. Sledges, rollers and boats remain plausible tools. What it does change is the balance of probability. Stonehenge looks less like a monument finished by chance and more like one completed through sustained effort. There is no single moment where the mystery disappears. Instead, the space for easy answers narrows. The stones arrived because people brought them. That idea now sits more comfortably with the evidence, even if the work behind it remains only partly visible.","Geologists at Curtin University, Australia, have uncovered the truth behind Stonehenge’s 25 tonne stones.

Voicing disappointment over the timid stance of her former colleagues, Braverman, who hails from an Indian heritage, is set to advocate for Fareham & Waterlooville under Nigel Farage's banner.

Who is Suella Braverman?

Education and career

Move to Reform UK





Former home secretary, Suella Braverman recently announced defection to Reform UK on January 26, 2026. The 45-year-old who had been a Conservative Party member for 30 years, shared that she will sit as the MP for Fareham & Waterlooville as a Reform UK member.“Today I’m announcing that I resign the Conservative whip. I have resigned the Conservative whip and my party membership of 30 years because I believe with my heart and soul that a better future is possible for us. I feel like I have come home” she said at the Reform UK event.When talking about the ""tragedy"" with her former alliance, Braverman said that the party had “great speeches, good slogans, but when the cameras are off, when the doors are shut and when they’re sat behind that table making difficult decisions for the country, they fold.”“There is only one man in British politics who has been courageously consistent for his country. And that man is Nigel Farage,"" she added. But who is Suella Braverman and is she of Indian-origin? Know more about her here.Suella Braverman was born as Sue-Ellen Cassiana Fernandes, on April 3, 1980 in Harrow, London. She was named after Sue-Ellen Ewing, the matriarch of the American TV show Dallas, one of her mother's favourite shows.The political representative who has served as home secretary under former Prime Ministers Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss, is of Indian-origin.She is the daughter of a Hindu Tamil mother Uma and a Goan-origin father Christie Fernandes. Her mother migrated to the UK from Mauritius while her father migrated from Kenya in the 1960s.Braverman completed her law at Queen's College, Cambridge and lived in France to do her master's degree in European and French law at Panthéon-Sorbonne. In May 2015, she was elected as a Conservative Party Member of Parliament for Fareham in south-east England. She worked as the Attorney General between 2020 and 2022 and as the Home Secretary under Sunak and Truss. As per her LinkedIn , she was a barrister at No 5 Chambers from 2008 to 2015 and the co-founder and trustee of the Africa Justice Foundation from 2010 to 2015.She tied the knot with South African business executive Rael Braverman in February 2019 at the House of Commons and is a mother of two. A Buddhist, Braverman attends the London Buddhist Centre and took her oath in parliament on the 'Dhammapada' scripture of Lord Buddha's sayings.The Conservative Party MP had long been rumoured to be making the move. Her defection follows that of Robert Jenrick, the former shadow justice secretary. In an interview with The Times, she had said it was time to “unite the right” and that there was “not much difference” between Farage’s policies and those of the Tories.Her defection brings the number of sitting MPs in Nigel Farage’s party to eight, five of whom are former Tories.On Monday, Farage described Braverman as “somebody who reached high office in the cabinet, reaching up to the rank of home secretary, but was there during those years and saw the betrayal of both our current and our former military, and now has the courage of her convictions to come stand with me on a Reform platform and speak to you today”.“26 failed Tory MPs have now joined Reform. You couldn’t trust them then, and you can’t trust them now,” responded The Labour Party in a series of fiery X posts, calling out the former CP members.","Suella Braverman, 45, announced defection to Reform UK on January 26, 2026.

The Happisburgh 800,000-year-old footprints mark the earliest human presence in northern Europe

Soft estuarine mud helped preserve the ancient footprints

Digital recording captured the footprints before they vanished

Foot size estimates suggest a mixed age group

The footprints align with evidence of Homo antecessor

Happisburgh sediments preserve a wider record of early life

The footprints offer a brief but direct human trace





Along a quiet stretch of coastline in eastern England, a short window of low tide revealed something rarely seen in Europe. Pressed into ancient mud and briefly exposed by shifting sands, a series of human footprints emerged on a Norfolk beach. The impressions were fragile and temporary, yet clear enough to record before the sea returned. Archaeologists later confirmed the prints date back around 800,000 years, making them the oldest known human footprints ever found outside Africa. Discovered near the village of Happisburgh, the site offers direct evidence of early humans living far further north than previously confirmed. The find adds physical detail to a deep period of human history that is usually known only through scattered stone tools and fragments of bone.The footprints were uncovered on the foreshore at Happisburgh on the Norfolk coast, an area already known for its early prehistoric remains. Researchers estimate the prints were made between one million and 780,000 years ago, during the Early Pleistocene. At that time, Britain was connected to mainland Europe by a land bridge, and the climate, while cooler than southern regions, could still support human groups.According to the research article “Hominin Footprints from Early Pleistocene Deposits at Happisburgh, UK” , the impressions include prints from adults and children, suggesting a small group rather than a single individual. Their size and shape fall within the range expected for early human species living in Europe at the time.Footprints rarely survive in the archaeological record. At Happisburgh, a specific set of conditions made preservation possible. The prints were formed in soft but stable estuarine mud, likely along the edge of a slow-moving river. Soon after being made, the surface was covered by layers of fine sediment, sealing the impressions before erosion could destroy them.Over hundreds of thousands of years, coastal processes buried and later re-exposed the surface. Modern coastal erosion finally brought the prints back into view, though only briefly.The footprints were visible for only a short time before waves and wind erased them. Archaeologists worked quickly, using multi-image photogrammetry to create detailed three-dimensional digital models. These models remain the only permanent record of the footprints.Through this method, researchers could identify heel marks, arches, and in one case, toe impressions. The orientation of the prints suggests the group was walking south across a muddy flat near the water’s edge.By measuring the length of the footprints, researchers estimated the individuals ranged from about one metre to nearly one point seven metres in height. This points to a group that included both children and adults.Such evidence is rare for this period. Early human fossils from Europe are extremely scarce, especially in Britain. The footprints provide information about body size, movement, and group behaviour that bones alone often cannot.No human fossils from this time period have been found in the UK. However, the footprints match the size range of Homo antecessor, a species identified from fossil remains in Atapuerca, Spain. Homo antecessor is currently the only known human species in western Europe from a similar age.While the species cannot be confirmed without skeletal remains, the footprints are consistent with what is known from southern Europe.The footprint surface sits within the Hill House Formation, a sequence of estuarine sands and silts laid down during a warm interglacial phase. These sediments have also yielded stone tools, animal remains, and plant evidence, building a picture of a landscape that early humans could inhabit.Together, these finds show that early humans were capable of surviving in northern environments far earlier than once assumed.Unlike tools or bones, footprints capture a moment rather than an object. At Happisburgh, that moment lasted only long enough to be recorded. The sea has since reclaimed the surface.What remains is a quiet record of people moving across a muddy shore, long before Britain was an island and long before history left written traces.","The 800,000-year-old footprints mark the earliest human presence in northern Europe.

How cool were Emmanuel Macron's sunglasses?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/how-to-buy-emmanuel-macrons-sunglasses/articleshow/127298460.cms,"‘What The Hell Macron’: Trump Mocks French President’s ‘Aviators’ During World Economic Forum

For sure. For sure

.





Albert Camus wrote in the opening lines of The Myth of Sisyphus, a must-read for anyone who feels low, or can read English: “There’s only one serious philosophical problem and that is suicide. Judging whether life is or is not worth living amounts to answering the fundamental question of philosophy. All the rest—whether or not the world has three dimensions, whether the mind has nine or twelve categories—comes afterwards.”It pains me greatly to disagree with the absurdity enthusiast, but there’s one question even more important than that: how cool were Emmanuel Macron’s sunglasses at the World Economic Forum? Say what you want about the French, they always know how to do things with style. Revolutions, republics, beheadings, exiles. Even their authoritarians have style. When Jean-Paul Sartre was arrested, Charles de Gaulle asked him to be released immediately, saying in a rather bathetic style: “One doesn’t arrest Voltaire.”All of which brings us to the current head of the Fifth Republic, Emmanuel Macron, who delivered a masterclass in French oratory with his emphasis on rule of law, standing up to bullies, and languid delivery (for sure, for sure).Yet the words coming out of his mouth were hardly as captivating as what he had on his face: a pair of Henry Jullien aviators worth 650 euros (US$750) or Rs 68,000.Even Donald Trump noticed, using his favourite words to describe them: “I watched him yesterday with those beautiful sunglasses—what the hell happened?”Macron’s office claimed it was to protect his eyes from a blood vessel; others wondered if it was another domestic tiff with his former teacher.But let’s cut to the chase. As Camus pointed out in the same essay, Galileo abjured the truth as soon as it endangered his life, because philosophical pursuits matter less than real-life questions, like: where can you get those glasses?Well all you have to do is head over to the company's temporary website.The glasses were crafted by Henry Jullien, a company founded in the Jura region of France—the Champagne region of French eyewear—that has been designing and producing high-end eyewear for a century, and like all French folks want to raise even utilatarian processes to philosophical pursuits.The company uses a technique called “doublé or” gold-laminate technology, a difficult and almost lost process where layers of pure gold are bonded to metal frames. It’s not mere plating; the gold becomes integral to the structure.Each frame is made through a rigorous artisanal process involving 279 individual steps.The impact showed up immediately in the markets. iVision Tech SpA, the Milan-listed parent company that owns Henry Jullien, saw its shares surge by nearly 28% in a single session after Emmanuel Macron’s sunglasses went viral at Davos, adding roughly €3.5 million (about $4 million) to its market capitalisation. The stock initially jumped around 6% before trading was briefly halted due to heavy volumes, and then continued climbing once trading resumed.But once Macron debuted them, the internet went berserk, crashing Henry Jullien’s website—perhaps undercutting Macron’s argument about Europe’s robust predictability. Thankfully, the French company found a workaround, setting up a temporary page and writing: “Following the significant visibility of the Pacific by Henry Jullien model, worn by President Emmanuel Macron at the Davos Forum, our eShop website is experiencing an exceptional volume of visits and enquiries. To ensure stable and secure access for everyone, we have enabled this official temporary page dedicated to purchasing the model.”So anyone who is part of the European Union can order them. If you are in any other part of the world, like the Americas or even post-Brexit UK, you will have to figure out some way to get your hands on them. Currently, the website says it will take seven days for them to be shipped.In his speech, Macron said: “…having a place like Europe, which sometimes is too slow, for sure, and needs to be reformed for sure, but which is predictable, loyal, and where, well, you know that the rule of the game is just a rule of law, it’s a good place. And I think this is a good place for today and for tomorrow.”We are not sure we agree with all that, but we do want those sunglasses.Because we imagine we would be as happy as Sisyphus wearing them.",Emmanuel Macron wore a pair of Henry Jullien aviators at the World Economic Forum. The glasses were crafted by a company founded in the Jura region of France.

EU's Huge Greenland Reveal After Trump Backs Off On Tariff Threat Over Invasion Protest

Greenland’s early history shaped by Erik the Red’s vision

How Norse settlers survived and thrived in Greenland

What Erik the Red left behind in Greenland





Erik the Red, whose real name was Erik Thorvaldsson, was a daring Viking explorer who famously turned a remote Arctic island into a thriving Norse settlement that endured for hundreds of years. Erik was born in Norway around 950 AD. He earned his fiery nickname because of his bright red hair and beard, as well as his bold and fiery personality. From a young age, he got into violent fights and feuds, which ultimately got him exiled from Norway and later forced him to leave Iceland as well.Erik sailed boldly west from Iceland in 982 AD after being exiled for murder. He discovered an uninhabited land of dramatic fjords, jagged rocky coastlines, and surprisingly fertile valleys. This land would later be named Greenland. He spent several years carefully exploring, mapping, and searching for the most suitable and habitable places to live and establish farms in this harsh, challenging new territory.One of Erik's most lasting gifts is the name he gave to the land: Greenland. He chose a name that was friendly and welcoming on purpose to get settlers to join him. He thought that calling it ""green land"" would make it sound better than a cold, remote frontier, which worked because it drew Icelandic settlers.The southern coastal areas where Erik lived were pretty fertile, especially in the summer. This made the name seem more real. People could live in these places even though Greenland's climate was harsh because they had grasslands and mild summers that made farming and grazing livestock possible. In 985 AD, Erik went back to Iceland to find people to live there after his first trip. His convincing stories made a group of families move west with their animals and supplies to start a new life. It was only 14 of the 25 ships that left that made it to Greenland safely.When Erik got there, he built two big settlements in southern Greenland: the Eastern Settlement, which is now near Qaqortoq, and the Western Settlement, which is now near Nuuk. He made Brattahlid (now Qassiarsuk) his chief's seat, which became the political and social center of Norse Greenland.The Norse settlers needed to farm, hunt, and trade to stay alive. They raised cows, sheep, and goats on the southern coast, hunted local animals, and traded things like walrus ivory and furs with Europe. Even though Greenland was cut off from the rest of the world, these settlements stayed in touch with Iceland and Norway.There were a few thousand people living in the communities at their peak, and they were spread out over farms along the coast. They were able to survive for hundreds of years in a harsh place by being smart and flexible. The Norse Greenlandic society eventually died out, probably because of a mix of climate change, economic problems, and being cut off from the rest of the world. Some of the most important Norse settlements in the North Atlantic were Erik the Red's in Greenland. Greenland was a center for trade, exploration, and colonization. Erik's son Leif Eriksson sailed west to North America around the year 1000 AD, which was a long time before other Europeans did.Greenland was an important part of the Viking network because it connected Scandinavia to faraway places and let Norse culture and knowledge spread across the Atlantic.People remember Erik the Red as a brave explorer and the man who built the first permanent European settlements in Greenland. His choice of name, whether he meant to or not, helped bring in settlers and start a new Norse society.The name Greenland is a tribute to Erik today. This shows how Viking exploration had a lasting effect and how one person's actions can change the identity of a whole country.","Erik the Red, whose real name was Erik Thorvaldsson, was a daring Viking explorer who famously turned a remote Arctic island into a thriving Norse settlement that endured for hundreds of years.

The forgotten Red Sea port that helped build the Great Pyramid



Merer’s journal shows how the Great Pyramid was built



How professional labour and elite supervision built Egypt’s iconic pyramid



How the Great Pyramid was built with precise planning







One of the biggest unanswered questions in history for the past few thousand years is the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt. Since its erection, it has been an unsolved enigma as to how the ancient Egyptians moved stones into place, as they weigh in the order of several tons each, and the sophisticated techniques they employed to shape these enormous pieces of limestone and hold them in place, as they never utilised any machines or sophisticated technology in its erection. However, in the year 2013, an important discovery was unearthed at the site called the Wadi El-Jarf in Egypt’s Red Sea coastal town, holding the Red Sea Papyri, an ancient account left by the journal of Merer, a chief overseer of the Great Pyramid, providing previously unknown details about transporting limestone from quarries and organising large teams of workers efficiently.Wadi El-Jarf today seems to lie off Egypt's Red Sea coast as a quiet patch of desert meeting sea. Yet over 4,500 years ago, it was a bustling port of immense strategic importance. First found in 1823 by British traveller John Gardner Wilkinson, the site had been mistaken for a cemetery from Greco-Roman times. Much later, during the 1950s, French archaeologists François Bissey and René Chabot-Morisseau assumed it could have been a center for metalworking.It wasn't until 2008 that French Egyptologist Pierre Tallet realised its importance: Wadi el-Jarf was an important logistical port during the reign of Pharaoh Khufu, allowing for the transport of crucial construction supplies to Giza.Approximately 240 kilometres away from the pyramid, the port managed to facilitate the shifting of copper from the Sinai Peninsula and limestone from the quarries of Tura-all by vessels traversing the Red Sea.The most revolutionary discovery made at Wadi El-Jarf was a collection of ancient papyri, now named the Red Sea Papyri. The most interesting of these are the journals written by a person named Merer, a chief overseer tasked with documenting the day-to-day activities carried out while transporting limestone slabs to be used to construct the Great Pyramid of Giza. The writings are a glimpse into the unmatched ingenuity of the ancient Egyptians.Merer's diary shows the disciplined, military-organized schedule followed by Merer's 200-strong team over a span of three months. For example:Day 25: “Inspector Merer spent the day with his team moving stones to Tura-South; spent the night at Tura-South”Day 26: “Inspector Merer left Tura-South with his team on a boat, filled with limestone blocks, to Akhet-Khufu [the Great Pyramid], spending the night at She-Khufu [administrative area near Giza].”These detailed records demonstrate the scale and detail of the operation, which included multiple trips each day, visiting quarries and the pyramid site.Until recent years, the popular imagination has cast the pyramid builders as enslaved laborers, conscripted into service by a tyrannical Pharaoh. The journal kept by Merer, however, paints a very different picture. As skilled professionals, the workers were paid in rations of bread, meat, dates, beer, and legumes because money did not form part of the Ancient Egyptian economy.The journal also presents evidence of the elite of Egypt overseeing construction. Individuals like Ânkhkhâf, half-brother of Khufu and ""chief of all the king's works,"" are found directly overseeing operations. One such fragment reads:Day 24: Inspector Merer spends the day with his za hauling [text missing] with people in elite positions, aper-teams, and the noble Ankh-haf, director of Ro-She Khufu.This would have shown that the pyramid project was a highly organized venture that brought together professional workers' know-how with the overall strategic guidance provided by the most important figures in the kingdom.What is valuable about Merer’s journal is that, while it documents movement, it also gives us an idea about ancient project management approaches. Every single move with regard to these ships carrying stones was monitored, documented, and coordinated. This was clearly unprecedented for ancient times, giving us an idea that not only did work on such an ambitious project as the Great Pyramid require manpower and materials, but also an unprecedented level of coordination, monitoring, and project management.","Wadi El-Jarf was an important logistical port during the reign of Pharaoh Khufu.

Mystery solved: What makes the sliding rocks of Death Valley move on their own,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/mystery-solved-what-makes-the-sliding-rocks-of-death-valley-move-on-their-own/articleshow/127535194.cms,"Mystery solved: What makes the sliding rocks of Death Valley move on their own (Image source: Wikipedia)

What are the sliding rocks of Racetrack Playa

How scientists finally observed the rocks move

The ice, sun, and wind mechanism

Rainwater collects on the playa, forming a thin layer of water.

Cold nights freeze the water, creating fragile ice only a few millimetres thick.

As the morning sun warms the ice, it begins to break into large floating panels.

Light winds push the ice sheets, which in turn push the rocks, dragging them slowly across the wet mud.

Why this rare phenomenon only happen occasionally

What the trails reveal

Visiting the Racetrack Playa





In one of the hottest and driest parts of the world, there is a phenomenon that is most unexpected. At a remote dry lake bed in the world-famous Death Valley area in the United States, large rocks are seen to be in motion.They slowly slide over the desert floor, with long tracks that do not seem to ever lift. The incredible movement of these rocks in the Racetrack Playa area has been a phenomenon not understood by scientists as well as tourists.There was never any animal or wind activity that could have caused the movement of the large rocks over the desert surface.Over the years, several theories were put forward, perhaps wind or even magnetic activity. Recent studies and research in the area made the phenomenon seem like one of the most interesting slow-motion events in nature.Racetrack Playa, in a remote part of Death Valley, is a dry lakebed that turns a shallow, slick surface after the occasional rain.The stones scattered across the dry lake, also known as ""sailing stones"" or ""sliding rocks,"" leave behind long trails etched into the soft mud as if they had been propelled by an invisible force.These trails can extend for tens of meters, often hundreds of meters, sometimes in straight lines or gentle curves, but for decades, nobody has watched them in motion.In 2013 and 2014, a team led by researchers set up on Racetrack Playa GPS-equipped stones, weather stations, and time-lapse cameras. For the first time, they documented rocks actually moving, in the process leaving trails behind. Their 2014 paper, “ Sliding Rocks on Racetrack Playa, Death Valley National Park: First Observation of Rocks in Motion ”, chronicled for the first time the resolution of the long-standing mystery. The movement associated itself with shallow pools of water, forming after rain; freezing temperatures at night; and thin sheets of ice, which form on the playa surface.So how do massive rocks slide across a nearly flat desert floor? The answer is a precise combination of conditions:This movement continues until the ice disintegrates or the water evaporates, leaving behind the characteristic trails in the mud.Sliding stones don't move every year, only when the rare mix of conditions is just right.Death Valley is one of the driest places in North America, so it needs enough rain to create shallow water, temperatures cold enough to freeze that water at night and sunshine to break the ice in the morning. Because all these factors must occur in the correct sequence, rock movement events are extremely rare. As a result, stones may move only a few times over several years, sometimes even decades.When these boulders move, they leave behind peculiar trails that tell their tale. Some of these trails are straight, some bend gradually, and others intersect each other. The length and direction of these trails would depend on wind direction, patterns of ice breakup, and the duration the ice sheets remained intact.Over time, hundreds of these trails were mapped by scientists, but it was the recording of actual motion that confirmed the cause.Nowadays, the place is considered a bucket list destination for geologists, photographers, and curious tourists. It’s most accessible in cooler months when conditions are milder, and occasionally when rare winter rain brings the sliding stones to life. If planning a visit to the place, tourists can be prepared to drive through rugged terrain.","Racetrack Playa, in a remote part of Death Valley, is a dry lakebed that turns a shallow, slick surface after the occasional rain.
