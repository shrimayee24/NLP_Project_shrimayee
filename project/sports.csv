Poll Will the experience of winning the T20 World Cup in 2024 impact Rohit's approach in the 2027 ODI World Cup? Yes, it will positively influence him No, past experiences do not matter It depends on the team's dynamics

NEW DELHI: In a stunning and deeply personal revelation, former India captain Rohit Sharma has admitted that he contemplated walking away from cricket altogether after India's crushing loss to Australia in the final of the 2023 ODI World Cup in Ahmedabad.Speaking at a Masters' Union event on Sunday, Rohit laid bare the emotional toll of the defeat, describing a period when the sport he loved felt like it had “taken everything” out of him.“After the 2023 World Cup final, I was completely distraught and felt like I didn't want to play this sport anymore because it had taken everything out of me and I felt I had nothing left,” Rohit said.India, under Rohit's leadership, had enjoyed a near-perfect campaign at home, storming into the final with ten straight wins. But in the match that mattered most, Australia executed their plans to perfection. After India were restricted to 240, Travis Head's match-winning century guided the Pat Cummins-led side to a six-wicket victory, leaving a stunned Narendra Modi Stadium in silence.Rohit said the pain was amplified by the sheer emotional investment he had made since taking over the captaincy in 2022.“Everybody was extremely disappointed, and we just couldn't believe what had happened. It was a very tough time for me personally because I had put everything into that World Cup — not just two or three months before it, but ever since I became captain.”The 38-year-old admitted it took months to recover mentally. “There was no energy left in my body. It took me a couple of months to recover and bring myself back,” he said, adding that self-reflection and a reminder of his love for the game helped him find his way back.That resilience would soon define the next chapter. Less than a year after the Ahmedabad heartbreak, Rohit led India to the T20 World Cup title in the USA and West Indies, a triumph he described as a lesson in resetting after disappointment.“I knew life doesn't end there. It was a big lesson — how to deal with disappointment, reset, and start fresh,” Rohit said. “It's very easy to say this now, but at that moment, it was extremely difficult.”Though he has since retired from Tests and T20Is and no longer captains the ODI side, Rohit continues in the 50-over format, with one final dream still driving him — a last shot at World Cup glory in 2027.","Rohit Sharma admits he contemplated quitting cricket after India's 2023 ODI World Cup loss to Australia.

Mahayuti sweeps Phase 1 of Maharashtra local body polls,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mahayuti-sweeps-phase-1-of-maharashtra-local-body-polls/articleshow/126109839.cms,"Image: IANS

BJP-Led Mahayuti Sweeps Maharashtra Local Body Polls; PM Modi, CM Fadnavis Hail Victory

PUNE/NAGPUR: BJP-led Mahayuti delivered a sweeping verdict after two rounds of the first phase of Maharashtra's civic elections, winning presidents' posts in nearly 207 of 288 municipal councils and nagar panchayats, mirroring its assembly election performance just over a year ago. Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) was reduced to 44 posts.Results were declared on Sunday after polling on Dec 2 and 20.BJP emerged as biggest gainer with victories in over 117 local bodies, cementing the position of chief minister Devendra Fadnavis . Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena secured 53 posts, while Ajit Pawar's NCP won 37.""We have won 117 presidents' posts, and more than 75% posts are with our Mahayuti partners. This is a repeat of the assembly election,"" Fadnavis said.CM Devendra Fadnavis said, “Compared to 2017, our elected representatives have doubled… This is the biggest win in local elections in the last 25 years for any party.”Final results of the 6,859 councillor seats were not released by the state election commission till the time of going to press. But BJP claimed to have won over 3,000 of these seats.Despite emerging as a distant challenger statewide, Congress checked BJP advances in parts of Vidarbha.Western Maharashtra saw Mahayuti allies battling each other as Congress and NCP (SP) struggled to hold ground. Meanwhile, BJP made gains in Mumbai and Konkan, encroaching into traditional Shiv Sena, PWP and NCP pockets. Shinde expanded Sena’s footprint beyond Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), finishing second across the state.North Maharashtra backed BJP strongly, especially in Jalgaon under minister Girish Mahajan. In Marathwada, expected gains from leaders such as Ashok Chavan and Munde cousins failed to materialise. Congress won just 28 civic bodies statewide. Sharad Pawar-led NCP managed seven, while Uddhav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena secured nine.Vidarbha delivered a fractured verdict. Congress halted BJP in several councils from Chandrapur to Buldhana and Ballarpur to Wardha, while BJP retained dominance in Nagpur, Gadchiroli and parts of Bhandara.Ajit Pawar-led NCP won 35 of 41 seats in Baramati region, the same undivided NCP had won in 2017. NCP (SP), led by Sharad Pawar, managed to win only one seat, while BSP and Rashtriya Samaj Paksha (RSP) also won a seat each. Three seats went to Independent candidates while BJP failed to open its account.The outcome is seen as a curtain-raiser to municipal corporation polls due Jan 15 and comes amid anger over flood-hit kharif crops and opposition charges that funds were diverted to populist schemes such as Mukhyamantri Mazhi Ladki Bahin Yojana. Polls also marked first statewide civic exercise after Shiv Sena and NCP splits, consolidating Shinde and Ajit Pawar as undisputed leaders of their factions.Biggest beneficiary remains Fadnavis. After BJP’s poor 2024 Lok Sabha showing — nine of 48 seats — and his offer to resign, he led Mahayuti to an assembly landslide of over 230 seats, with BJP winning 132. Opposition allegations of “vote chori” and EVM manipulation resurfaced but lost traction after civic sweep.Analysts blamed MVA for failing to capitalise on farm distress. Former CM Prithviraj Chavan admitted Congress could not raise youth and farmer issues effectively.","Results were declared on Sunday after polling on Dec 2 and 20.

‘Local-level confusion’: How Kharge’s remark adds twist to Siddaramaiah vs DK Shivakumar power tussle in Karnataka,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/local-level-confusion-how-kharges-remark-adds-twist-to-siddaramaiah-vs-dk-shivakumar-power-tussle-in-karnataka/articleshow/126124755.cms,"Siddaramaiah, DK Shivakumar Project Unity After High-Stakes Karnataka Meet Amid Rumours Of Cong Rift

NEW DELHI: Who will resolve the ongoing power tussle in Karnataka between chief minister Siddaramaiah and his deputy DK Shivakumar - top Congress leadership in Delhi or the leaders themselves at the local level?On Sunday, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge shielded the ""high command"" from this embarrassing power game in Karnataka and said that “any confusion on the leadership issue existed at the local level.” Kharge also added that the local leaders should take ownership of the internal disputes rather than blaming the high command.The remark is not only interesting, given the strong and established high command culture in the grand-old party, but is also open to many interpretations.Did Kharge endorse Siddaramaiah’s claim to continue as chief minister for a full five-year term? After all, he is the chief minister at present and if there is no confusion at the central level on the leadership issue, it perhaps could mean that Siddaramaiah has the support of the high command.The talk about an alleged deal on rotational chief ministership and the demand for DK Shivakumar to take over the top post after two-and-a-half years has been raised by the supporters of the deputy chief minister at the local level. So, by calling the leadership tussle a local issue, is Kharge citing these claims in favour of DKS made by some MLAs and local Congress leaders?Kharge had, in his remarks, also cautioned party leaders against claiming credit for Congress's electoral success in the last assembly elections.""Everyone has built the party. It's not any individual's effort. Congress has been built by party workers. Congress workers supported us,"" Kharge said without naming anyone.This again points more towards the supporters of DK Shivakumar, who have openly claimed that the deputy chief minister, who is also the state Congress president, had played a key role in the party’s spectacular victory in the 2023 assembly elections.The Congress had in 2023 won a comprehensive majority, bagging 135 assembly seats out of 224 with a vote share of 43.2%. The BJP was decimated and reduced to just 66 seats with a vote share of 36.3%.However, the leadership tussle has overshadowed this victory from Day 1. The Congress leadership then had to make a lot of effort and persuasion to convince DK Shivakumar to allow Siddaramaiah to lead the government.There were then reports of an alleged power-sharing arrangement between Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar. As the Congress government crossed the halfway mark of its five-year term on November 20, speculations intensified about a leadership change. MLAs of both factions have petitioned the high command in support of their leaders.Taking a cue from Kharge’s remark, Karnataka home minister G Parameshwara on Monday said any differences or confusions within the party over the leadership issue in the state have to be resolved locally.""Everyone of us should know, we should resolve ourselves. If the All India Congress president says that you (state leaders) resolve yourself and have nothing to do with the high command, we all have to sit together and resolve,"" Parameshwara said.Chief minister Siddaramaiah, however, reiterated his stand that Congress top leader Rahul Gandhi and the party high command will have to take a decision on the CM change issue, and everyone will abide by their decision.""I don't know about it. Rahul Gandhi and the high command have to decide. Whatever they decide, I'm committed to it,"" Siddaramaiah told reporters here in response to a question on Kharge's statement.""I have spoken to the high command. They have said that they will decide. I will abide by whatever the high command decides,"" he said.Siddaramaiah had on Friday asserted on the floor of the assembly that he would continue in office. He had also said that the Congress high command was ""in my favour"" and asserted that no decision was made on his staying at the helm for only two-and-a-half years.Reacting to his remarks, Shivakumar had said that he and CM Siddaramaiah have come to an agreement with the involvement of the Congress high command, and both of them will abide by it.This is not the first time that DKS has spoken about the power-sharing agreement. In fact, when the tussle had started, he had made a cryptic social media post stating that “word power is world power.”“Keeping one’s word is the greatest strength in the world! The biggest force in the world was to keep one’s word... Be it a judge, president, or anyone else, including myself, everyone has to walk the talk. Word power is world power,” DKS had then written.Siddramaraiah had then responded sharply to this and had countered DKS with his own play of words. ""A Word is not power unless it betters the World for the people,"" Siddaramaiah wrote and detailed the various welfare schemes that his government had launched for people of Karnataka.This power tussle has already caused a lot of embarrassment for the Congress leadership and also raised questions about its ability to resolve disputes between state leaders.Kharge’s remarks have done little to bring clarity on the way forward. It will be interesting to see how DKS responds to his statement, especially on not giving him credit for the party's victory in the 2023 elections.","Mallikarjun Kharge shielded the ""high command"" from this embarrassing power game in Karnataka. Kharge also added that the local leaders should take ownership of the internal disputes rather than blaming the high command. Karnataka home minister G Parameshwara on Monday said any differences or confusions within the party over the leadership issue in the state have to be resolved locally.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126125021,imgsize-689347,width-400,resizemode-4/congress-president-mallikarjun-kharge-with-karnataka-cm-siddaramaiah-and-dk-shivakumar-pti-file-photo.jpg"

KOCHI: Kochi city police decided to close the much-discussed drug-related case involving actor Shine Tom Chacko after forensic examination reports returned negative, ruling out drug use.

Nail & hair samples collected from both were sent for forensic analysis. Police received results Monday, confirming the absence of narcotic substances.The case attracted attention in April following scenes at a luxury hotel in Kaloor when a Dansaf (district anti-narcotic special action force) team conducted an inspection based on secret information about alleged drug transactions. Shine, who was staying at the hotel, allegedly fled after noticing cops, jumping from his third-floor room into the swimming pool below.","Shine Tom Chacko was arrested in Kochi, India, in April.

Chiefs heiress Gracie Hunt says the 15-pound gain came from muscle, recovery, and long-term planning

Chiefs heiress Gracie Hunt shares structured workouts, consistency advice, and public appearance at AmericaFest 2025

Chiefs heiress Gracie Hunt is not playing into the optics game. She is controlling the message herself.Chiefs heiress Gracie Hunt shared a candid breakdown of her 2025 fitness journey on social media this week, openly revealing that she gained about 15 pounds over the past year. The admission was not framed as a setback. It was framed as progress. Hunt said the change came from intentional training, metabolic reset, and a shift away from appearance-driven goals.Chiefs heiress Gracie Hunt positioned the transformation as a long-term commitment to strength and sustainability. Her post focused on how her body performed, how her energy stabilized, and how patience replaced pressure.“My 2025 fitness goal was simple: become the strongest version of myself, inside and out,” she wrote.Chiefs heiress Gracie Hunt made it clear that the year was not about restarting or chasing fast results. She said her approach changed once she prioritized training with intention and respecting recovery.“This year wasn’t about starting over. It was about getting smarter. Training with intention, thinking long-term, and learning that strength, balance, and longevity matter more than chasing quick results. I learned that recovery isn’t optional, it’s part of the work.”Chiefs heiress Gracie Hunt later addressed the weight change directly and explained how it happened.ID@undefinedCaption not available.ID@undefinedCaption not available.ID@undefinedCaption not available.“I reset my metabolism, fueled my body on purpose, and slowly recomposed, adding about 15 lbs of muscle since I began this journey.”She added that she stopped centering progress around appearance. Instead, she focused on how her body felt day to day, when to push, and when to pause. Hunt said the result was steadier energy and sharper focus as the year progressed.The post was paired with workout clips and set to music by The Weeknd, reinforcing the message without changing its tone. Chiefs heiress Gracie Hunt closed the post by stating she ended the year stronger than she began it.Kansas City Chiefs owner Clark Hunt’s daughter, Gracie Hunt, shared moments from Turning Point USA’s AmericaFest 2025, held Thursday through Saturday at the Phoenix Convention Center in Phoenix. Dressed in a light beige jacket and flared pants with her hair worn down, Hunt reflected on the experience in an Instagram post, calling it a meaningful few days centered on faith, freedom, and gratitude for the country. WNBA player Sophie Cunningham reacted with fire emojis, prompting a warm exchange between the two in the comments.Earlier in the week, Chiefs heiress Gracie Hunt shared a separate post labeled “Training Tuesday,” showing an upper-body workout performed outdoors with dumbbells and a mat.“Upper body strength doesn’t have to be complicated. All you need is a set of dumbbells, a mat, and a commitment to show up,” she wrote.“Focus on controlled reps, strong posture, and breathing with intention,quality always beats quantity.”Chiefs heiress Gracie Hunt also advised followers to keep workouts simple and repeatable, especially on busy days. She encouraged starting small rather than skipping sessions entirely.Later that week, Chiefs heiress Gracie Hunt attended Turning Point USA’s AmericaFest in Phoenix. The event runs Dec. 18–21 at the Phoenix Convention Center and honors the legacy of Charlie Kirk, with programming led by his widow Erika Kirk. Hunt shared brief glimpses of the event on social media.While the Kansas City Chiefs continue to navigate an uneven close to the season under owner Clark Hunt, Chiefs heiress Gracie Hunt ended 2025 on her own terms. She defined success by strength gained, habits built, and consistency maintained.“Finishing the year stronger than I started, and remembering that growth never really ends.”In other news, with injuries sidelining early picks, the spotlight shifts to rookie cornerback Nohl Williams as the Kansas City Chiefs face the Tennessee Titans. The third-round pick out of California has played in 14 games, handled a steady workload, and shown reliability as a tackler, even as his coverage remains a work in progress. With Trent McDuffie ruled out and Jaylen Watson nearing free agency, this matchup gives Williams a real chance to log heavy snaps and prove he can handle a bigger role when the stakes are low but the evaluation is very real.","Chiefs heiress Gracie Hunt shared a candid breakdown of her 2025 fitness journey on social media this week.

Becky Lynch returns as faction tensions rise on RAW

How to watch WWE RAW live on December 22, 2025

December 22, 2025: Grand Rapids, Michigan, Van Andel Arena: WWE Monday Night RAW (Taped Holiday-week edition). As one of the final RAWs of the year, the show also helps WWE build towards Royal Rumble 2026. While championship alliances, faction rivalries, and surprise appearances have all helped shape the red brand in recent weeks, this episode is meant to serve as the bridge between premium live events in late 2022 and the turn of the new year.While taped earlier because of WWE's tour schedule, RAW will still broadcast in its standard Monday night timeslot, and there are plenty of storyline developments expected to take place. Fans can expect a well-balanced card, the freshest of top stars, and established rivalries that have a permanent wave of momentum through January.One of the highlight matches for the December 22 show is a big-time singles battle between two top women in WWE, Rhea Ripley vs. Asuka, which we could see having an impact on title and tag team angles moving forward. This is a match set to headline with Ripley continuing to cement herself as a top star on RAW, and Asuka's experience and unpredictability put her up against anyone.Also on the card, Bayley vs. Roxanne Perez, which is a great chance for Bayley to get her groove back and an even better way to test Perez against true top of the main roster competition. It will also feature Je’Von Evans vs. Rayo Americano, also part of WWE's pushing newer talent, along with the stars they already have.It is expected that the headline match will be a tag team contest with World Heavyweight Champion CM Punk and Rey Mysterio facing off against The Vision's Austin Theory and Bronson Reed. This match-up keeps Punk's unease with new generations of talent going while further establishing Theory's place as a major player on RAW.There is expected to be a heavy emphasis on storyline progression throughout the night. Close out the night with a segment that sees Becky Lynch return and confront a feud to add even more depth to the 2026 women's division. At the same time, the smoldering friction in Judgment Day and The Vision remains high, as both backstage promos and in-ring interactions are laying the seeds for future conflicts.Another angle to keep an eye on in WWE, of course, is whether or not the company is subtly switching allegiances and power players as Paul Heyman becomes involved with Austin Theory. The rise of Bron Breakker and Bronson Reed also means shakeups to the faction scene on RAW.WWE RAW airs live on Monday night via Netflix, continuing the platform’s role as RAW’s global streaming home. Broadcast times vary by region, with international viewers able to watch live or on demand depending on local availability.The final WWE RAW 2025 must end with a bang as compelling matches, returning superstars, and the progression of storylines will bring this year to a finish and lay the groundwork for the road to Royal Rumble.Also Read: Are Cooper DeJean and Nikki Bella dating?

Erika Kirk addresses Candace Owens meeting, accusations, and Egypt plane theory





Erika Kirk has spoken publicly for the first time about her private meeting with Candace Owens, and her message was calm, clear, and direct. She made it clear that she is done with public drama and wants to move forward. On December 21, Fox News Sunday shared a preview of an upcoming interview with Erika Kirk, the CEO of Turning Point USA. In the interview, she speaks with host Shannon Bream about faith, leadership, and recent controversy around the organization.In a separate clip shared by Fox News, Shannon Bream asked Erika Kirk a direct question. She asked whether Kirk had found any “common ground” with Candace Owens after meeting her face to face.Erika Kirk did not avoid the question. Instead, she explained why the meeting happened and what her goal was. She said she did not go into the meeting to argue or judge Owens. She said the meeting was about clarity and honesty.Erika Kirk said:“I’m not going to speak on her behalf. We provided what we wanted to provide to show context, and also to show we have nothing to hide. And you just let the Lord do the rest. But I’m not going to sit and judge how anyone interpreted anything outside of myself.So I pray for her. I pray for her family and let the Lord handle the rest. We’re building. I don’t have time for the noise. I said my piece, and that’s it. And we get back to work. ” This interview marked the first time Erika Kirk publicly addressed the private meeting.Candace Owens has made several serious claims against Turning Point USA since the assassination of Charlie Kirk. Over the past few weeks, Erika Kirk addressed those claims in multiple interviews and publicly asked Owens to stop spreading them.Instead of backing down, Candace Owens shifted her focus toward Charlie Kirk’s wife. That led Erika Kirk to invite Owens to a private, closed-door meeting, which she announced on X. Owens accepted the invitation.The meeting took place on December 15. Afterward, both Erika Kirk and Candace Owens posted on X and described the meeting as “productive.”However, the situation did not end there.Candace Owens later shared her own version of the meeting during a podcast episode. She continued to question official findings and refused to believe that Tyler Robinson was responsible for Charlie Kirk’s murder.During AmericaFest (AmFest), Erika Kirk appeared to respond to one of Owens’ most talked-about claims, the so-called Egyptian plane theory. Owens had claimed that two Egyptian planes were tracking Erika Kirk for years and questioned whether they were present at Provo Airport on the day Charlie Kirk was shot.While speaking on stage, Erika Kirk said:“We have 40 breakout sessions, 178 sponsors, and all 50 states represented. We have 25 countries represented, plus Puerto Rico. But I have the list here. Don’t worry, guys, Egypt is not on the list. Don’t worry about that. Oh, how funny. I say ‘Egypt,’ and my iPad turns on. That’s fun.”The comment drew strong reactions online. Later the same day, Ben Shapiro criticized Candace Owens during his AmFest speech. Owens responded by calling him a “parasite.”After AmFest ended, Candace Owens also agreed with comedian Tim Dillon, who called the event “bad reality drama,” and said on X that the event felt “out of touch and elite.”Also Read: Candace Owens Shares Shocking Fresh Witness Claim About Erika Kirk Meeting Security Before Charlie Kirk Death",Erika Kirk has spoken publicly for the first time about her private meeting with Candace Owens.

Ravens brace for critical week as Jackson awaits MRI results

The Baltimore Ravens walked off the field Sunday night facing far more than a disappointing loss. Their 24–23 collapse against the New England Patriots was overshadowed by the early exit of quarterback Lamar Jackson, whose injury has put Baltimore’s fading playoff hopes in serious danger. Jackson left the game late in the second quarter after receiving a knee to his lower back on a short run.Jackson had been in top form before the injury, showing great efficiency and command in the game. His departure forced the Ravens to lean on backup Tyler Huntley. Baltimore briefly appeared to steady itself, even building a double-digit lead in the fourth quarter. That momentum, however, slipped away as the Patriots mounted a late comeback, leaving the Ravens stunned and sitting at 7–8.Head coach John Harbaugh offered limited clarity regarding Jackson’s condition after the game, saying, “It’s a bruise of some kind, I think. I don’t know how serious it will be. We’ll have to find out in the next couple of days. He got kneed in the back.” Jackson echoed the uncertainty, admitting he was in too much pain to return but hopes to play next week.The timing could not be worse, as Jackson is scheduled for an MRI on Monday, and the results will shape the Ravens’ entire approach heading into a must-win Week 17 matchup against the Green Bay Packers.At 9–5–1, Green Bay presents a tough challenge even with a healthy roster. Without Jackson, it will be a herculean task to secure a tight win.This injury adds to a long list of physical setbacks for Jackson this season, including missed games due to a hamstring issue and lingering problems with his ankle, toe, and knee. Despite those challenges, he has remained central to Baltimore’s identity and playoff hopes.Now, the Ravens must wait and prepare for what is next, critically assessing their strategy. Whether Jackson comes back or not, Baltimore’s postseason fate mostly hinges on the next few days. As the reputed team is in a tight spot and needs a big win, the QB’s return could be their only hope.Also read: ""John Harbaugh needs to be fired and Lamar Jackson traded"": Joe Burrow's ex-teammate tears into Ravens, calls for ruthless decisions","Lamar Jackson suffered a knee to his lower back in the second quarter of Sunday's game.

Taylor Swift was not seen at Nissan Stadium, and reports point to security planning

Kansas City’s Mahomes-less day got worse, but Travis Kelce hit a Jerry Rice milestone

Taylor Swift was not seen at Nissan Stadium for the Kansas City Chiefs’ Dec. 21 road game against the Tennessee Titans, a 26-9 loss that came without quarterback Patrick Mahomes, who is recovering from a torn ACL, per Yahoo.Her absence also fit the pattern that Elle reported this weekend: Swift has stuck to Chiefs home games this season, with multiple outlets citing security planning and venue familiarity as a major reason.Yahoo reported Swift “seemingly gave the Chiefs vs. Titans match a miss,” after attending Kansas City’s Dec. 14 home loss to the Los Angeles Chargers at Arrowhead Stadium. Yahoo also noted Swift “mainly attends Chiefs’ home games at Arrowhead Stadium,” and added there is “a possibility” she attends the Chiefs’ home game vs. the Denver Broncos on Christmas Day, citing USA Today.Elle went further on the away-game pattern and pointed to security concerns as the driving factor. It cited a Page Six source from October 2024: “She’s not going anywhere unless she knows the venue intimately, and it has been thoroughly scouted and secured in advance.” Elle also noted Swift has “been keeping a lower profile” even at home games, writing that she has not been photographed arriving and is rarely shown on broadcasts.Yahoo included another Page Six quote that framed the same idea around logistical comfort and advance scouting: “She has worked with Arrowhead so many times, they feel at ease and comfortable. Going to all kinds of different stadiums, you need to send a team in advance.” Yahoo also referenced concerns tied to Swift’s stalker, Brian Jason Wagner, as part of why she appears to prefer home games.Kelce, meanwhile, addressed effort and standards even with Kansas City eliminated from playoff contention, per Elle’s recap of “New Heights.” He said: “If we’re gonna go out there and play some football, we’re gonna do it the right way and, keep trying to get these things fixed and end on the highest note that we can.” He added: “All I’d know is to go out there and play my ass off and to show up and, you know, give my guys the best chance to win,” and, “I think that’s the mentality, man. There’s an integrity thing here.”Athlon Sports laid out how quickly the Chiefs’ situation shifted. Mahomes suffered a season-ending knee injury in the fourth quarter of a 16-13 loss to the Chargers, tearing his ACL and LCL, which ended Kansas City’s playoff hopes before the Titans game, per Athlon.Without Mahomes, Gardner Minshew started against Tennessee, then left after suffering an injury in the second quarter, per Athlon. That forced Chris Oladokun into action, and Athlon reported Oladokun’s first NFL completion went to Kelce on a 6-yard catch with 8:28 left in the second quarter.That one catch mattered. Athlon reported it pushed Kelce past 800 receiving yards for the season, giving him 12 straight seasons with 800-plus yards. Athlon also cited Chiefs on SI’s Zak Gilbert saying Kelce became the second player in NFL history to hit that 12-season streak, joining Jerry Rice.Kelce has already made it clear he does not want to coast to the finish line. Earlier this season, he said: “In terms of the historical stuff, I’m still looking at the next game and the next catch and trying to get better,” and, “I’m just the old, lucky dog still able to do this thing, man. I’m putting on the pads like I’m 15 years old again. I’m loving every single bit of it.” (Athlon)What comes next is simple. The Chiefs have two games left, starting with the Broncos at home on Christmas Day, followed by a Week 18 road game against the Las Vegas Raiders, per Athlon and Elle. If Swift shows up again, history says it will be Arrowhead, not a road tunnel. And if she doesn’t, the security question is still going to be the headline.","Taylor Swift was not seen at Nissan Stadium for the Kansas City Chiefs’ Dec. 21 road game against the Tennessee Titans.

NBA and FIBA plan a new pan-European league that supports domestic leagues and player development

The NBA and FIBA aim to launch a new European league that grows the game locally while expanding the NBA’s global reach

Today, the International Basketball Federation (FIBA) and the National Basketball Association ( NBA ) announced that they will continue their joint investigation of a new professional, pan-European men's basketball league in January by inviting potential teams and ownership groups to participate in the league's application process.In addition to permanent franchises, the proposed league ""would offer all teams from FIBA-affiliated national leagues in Europe a merit-based pathway to qualify each year,"" either through an end-of-season qualifying competition or FIBA's Basketball Champions League (BCL).In order to start interacting with and identifying European clubs and ownership groups for the establishment of a new pan-European professional basketball league, the NBA and FIBA have set a crucial deadline.In addition to permanent slots, the new league would provide every team in a domestic league in Europe connected with FIBA with a merit-based road to qualify annually through either an end-of-season qualifying event or FIBA's BCL. In order to enable players to represent their club and national team all year round, the league would also synchronize its timetable with those of domestic leagues and national teams.Additionally, both organizations stress that as part of the new league, they intend to provide resources and financial support to the ongoing growth of the European basketball ecosystem, which includes national leagues, club academies, and current NBA and FIBA programs that aim to develop aspiring players, coaches, and referees at all levels of the game.The proposed concept would incorporate the new league within the existing European basketball scene, with clubs competing in their own national leagues. The league would provide clubs with a merit-based route to qualification via the European basketball ecosystem in addition to permanent teams.FIBA Secretary General Andreas Zagklis said:“The progress of this joint NBA–FIBA project is very good news for the European basketball community.. T he format of the league respects European sport model principles by offering any ambitious club in the continent a fair pathway to the top. The project is conceived in a way that will improve the sustainability of the entire European basketball ecosystem, including players, clubs, leagues and national federations, by generating a knock-on effect that will strongly benefit basketball fans throughout Europe. ”In order to enable players to represent both their clubs and national teams, the season would also coincide with the current domestic league and national team calendars. Domestic leagues, club team academies, and initiatives to train players, coaches, and referees would all be covered by this cash.As part of the new league, the NBA and FIBA would also intend to devote funds and resources to the ongoing growth of Europe's basketball ecosystem, which includes club team academies, domestic leagues, and the NBA and FIBA's current initiatives to train future players, coaches, and referees at all levels of the sport.An NBA Europe league is NBA Commissioner Adam Silver's largest attempt to date to expand the NBA's global presence. The problem in Europe will be competing against the well-established EuroLeague, a league that has a long history and is very important to supporters.Talking about it, Silver said:“Our conversations with various stakeholders in Europe have reinforced our belief that an enormous opportunity exists around the creation of a new league on the continent.. Together with FIBA, we look forward to engaging prospective clubs and ownership groups that share our vision for the game’s potential in Europe.”In the upcoming months, the NBA and FIBA will release further information.Also read: Is Elden Campbell a Hall of Fame?

Andrew Tate strikes massive Misfits payday despite defeat against Chase DeMoor



'HE'S NOT THE SAME ANDREW TATE' - Andrew and Tristan Tate FIRST REACTION TO CHASE DEMOOR LOSS

Andrew Tate may have lost inside the ring, but his brother Tristan insists the former kickboxing champion walked away with a massive payday. Tristan Tate claimed Andrew was set to earn $52 million from his involvement in last night’s Misfits Mania event. The fight took place in Dubai, where Tate faced Chase DeMoor in a bout that attracted major attention online.In the build-up, Andrew Tate was heavily promoted as Misfits Boxing’s new CEO, replacing KSI. Many fans believed this was a staged storyline similar to professional wrestling. However, Tristan has now suggested that while the title may have been exaggerated, Andrew did secure a significant ownership stake in the company as part of his deal to fight.The fight was a huge success for broadcaster Rumble Premium. Inside the ring, though, the night went badly for Andrew Tate. He appeared to run out of energy, was knocked down, and eventually lost to Chase DeMoor.DeMoor is best known as a reality TV personality rather than a professional boxer, making the defeat even more damaging to Tate’s fighting image.Despite the loss, Tristan Tate focused on the business side. Speaking on the Cars and Money podcast, he explained how Tate’s earnings went far beyond standard fight pay.He said the rumors about Andrew becoming Misfits Boxing’s new CEO were true in principle. According to Tristan, the deal involved demanding a 10 per cent stake in the company.He explained, “The whole rumor about Andrew as the new CEO of Misfits, that’s true. We demanded 10 per cent of the company. If Andrew fought on Misfits and then becomes the face of Misfits, your company has just gone up 50 per cent in value. So give us 10 per cent. It was a simple business negotiation.”Tristan then claimed Misfits Boxing is valued at $520 million. Based on that figure, he suggested Andrew’s ownership alone would be worth $52 million. He added that this was separate from Tate’s actual fight purse, which he chose not to disclose.Tristan Tate also admitted that the public tension involving KSI was partly for show. He said KSI remains a major owner of Misfits Boxing and understood the business advantage of bringing the Tate brothers into the promotion.The Tate brothers have often highlighted their ability to make money across different ventures. Andrew Tate has previously claimed his personal net worth is around $700 million. While the figures shared by Tristan remain unverified, they have once again placed the spotlight on how spectacle and business often outweigh results in modern influencer boxing.Also Read: Jake Paul and Anthony Joshua reportedly earn over $40-50 million each from viral Netflix boxing spectacle","Tristan Tate claims Andrew Tate was set to earn $52 million from Misfits bout.

Why Darren Dreger believes Craig Berube is not on the hot seat yet

The Toronto Maple Leafs, Craig Berube, and potential coaching change rumors have turned into daily discussions as the frustration of the fans keeps escalating. The Maple Leafs' fall to last place in the Atlantic Division has drawn more attention to the team, not just through post-game reactions but a complete debate about the leadership, direction, and accountability as the season goes further off track.That tension has, of course, raised one uneasy question in the league: could Craig Berube be gone by Christmas? While the atmosphere in Toronto is heated, insider discussions imply that the situation might not be moving at the same pace as some fans are wishing for.Darren Dreger, NHL insider, while talking on TSN’s First Up, said that even though the team’s frustration is growing, the idea of a coaching change in Toronto being the immediate future is being overblown. Dreger, who is very much in the know of things going on, said that there is indeed some level of discontent within the organization, but he also made it clear that there was no indication during the early part of this week that the management was ready to make an abrupt or major decision concerning Craig Berube's future.Dreger also went on to comment on the rumors regarding a rift between Berube and Auston Matthews, labeling it as a case of exaggeration.He mentioned that there is a source who is close to Matthews, and according to that particular individual, the captain of the Leafs is respectful towards Berube and the rest of the staff. Dreger continued by saying that Berube's involvement in the most recent playoff run, which was the longest for the Leafs, still counts when judging whether a coaching change would actually help the problem.At this moment, Berube seems to be safe, but the patience in Toronto is notorious for its shortness. If the situation does not get better quickly, even the most thoughtful opinions may start to express doubts about his future in a much louder way.Also Read: Inside Connor McDavid’s luxury car collection: supercars, favorites, and what makes it unique","NHL insider Darren Dreger believes that Craig Berube is not on the hot seat yet.

Tristan Jarry's lower‑body injury sidelines Edmonton Oilers starter

The Edmonton Oilers received a tough blow as Tristan Jarry, their newly acquired starting goaltender, suffered a lower-body injury and will miss several weeks. Jarry, who was acquired from the Pittsburgh Penguins along with forward Samuel Poulin in a major trade, was expected to stabilize Edmonton’s net this season. His absence now forces the team to adjust quickly.The injury occurred during a recent NHL game when Jarry slid awkwardly across the crease and had to leave the ice. Head coach Kris Knoblauch confirmed that Jarry has been placed on injured reserve and will be sidelined until fully cleared. The decision ensures Jarry’s proper recovery but leaves the Oilers relying heavily on backup goaltenders in upcoming matches.The Oilers will have to rely on their backup goalies to handle the net in the next few NHL games since Jarry is out. Without their starting goalie, the team's defense and overall performance are under more pressure. Especially in important mid-season games. Both fans and analysts are keeping a close eye on how the team changes without Jarry.Since joining Edmonton, Jarry has had some good games and some bad ones. He needs to be more consistent overall. The team thought Jarry would immediately make their goaltending better, but the injury has put those hopes on hold.The Oilers are still hopeful that Jarry will get better, but they stress that he needs to do the right rehab to make sure he comes back at full strength. In the meantime, backup goalies will have to do the work, and the team's coaches will have to be careful about how they rotate players. As Jarry gets closer to a full return, the Oilers' official channels will keep fans up to date.Also Read: Net worth of Auston Matthews in 2025: Details on Toronto Maple Leafs captain's earnings, salary, and contracts",Tristan Jarry suffered a lower-body injury during a recent NHL game.

Vegas Golden Knights know how to build a Stanley Cup-winning roster



Also Read:

Jack Eichel entered the 2025-26 season as one of the biggest names potentially heading to unrestricted free agency. He didn't stay on the market long. The Vegas Golden Knights soon re-signed their star center on an eight-year, $108 million contract extension.The contract also includes a full no-movement clause to make sure their best player remains in Vegas. Meanwhile, for Eichel, this wasn’t a tough decision to make. He had already lifted the Stanley Cup with Vegas, and their acquisition of Mitch Marner back in the summer proves that the franchise is just as serious as him when it comes to their championship dreams.Vegas pulled off arguably its greatest coup when it executed a sign-and-trade for Marner, removing the league's top free agent from the market before he could field any other offers. Eichel was effusive with his praise for the move and what it meant for his future.""He's a world-class hockey player. He's one of the smartest players in our league,” Eichel explained. The Marner deal wasn't just about adding talent. However, for Eichel, getting Marner wasn’t just about acquiring another big name. It was also proof of the Golden Knights’ commitment to win another Stanley CupThat was something that connected with Eichel, as he stated, ""Beyond the term, dollars, or specific clauses in my contract, it's the franchise's bold moves like landing Marner that made signing an easy decision.”For a player of his caliber, it is reassuring when the team he plays with is just as serious as him about winning the title.They've added players like Tomas Hertl and Noah Hanifin, and now Marner. That willingness to do whatever it takes to compete for championships is exactly what Eichel wants. He continued, ""It's an organization that wants to win the Stanley Cup every year. As a player, that's all you can ask for. “Eichel also knows that Vegas is giving their all to win the title once again. He continued, “ We know they're going to do what's necessary to give us a chance to win, and it's what I want to do. Continue to push to win another Stanley Cup here in Vegas. It was a huge part of my decision.""Eichel, meanwhile, continues to spearhead Vegas’ offense. Since his debut as a Golden Knight on February 16, 2022, he's been among the NHL 's leading scorers with 100 goals and 253 points. He helped Vegas win a Stanley Cup and posted a playoff-best 26 points during that championship run.Last season, Eichel posted a career-best 94 points and finished eighth in NHL scoring while earning top-five finishes for the Hart, Selke, and Lady Byng trophies. When asked about signing the extension, Eichel made his feelings clear.""I said all along I wanted to be here, playing for the Vegas Golden Knights. Really happy to get it done. So happy to continue my career here in Vegas,"" Eichel said.

The contract also includes a full no-movement clause to make sure their best player remains in Vegas.

Will Ricky Pearsall play against the Indianapolis Colts tonight?

How and when to watch the 49ers vs. Colts Monday Night Football game

The San Francisco 49ers are rolling at the right time. A Week 15 win over the Tennessee Titans pushed them to 10-4 and kept the NFC West race alive heading into Monday Night Football. But as San Francisco prepares to face the Indianapolis Colts on the road, attention has shifted away from playoff math and toward availability.Ricky Pearsall was one of the biggest reasons the 49ers offense looked sharp last week. Now, just days later, his status has become a central question as Kyle Shanahan’s team looks to extend its winning streak without disrupting offensive rhythm.No, Ricky Pearsall will not play against the Colts. The 49ers ruled the wide receiver out after he missed the entire practice week with knee and ankle injuries suffered during Sunday’s win over Tennessee.Head coach Kyle Shanahan confirmed the decision Saturday, saying Pearsall got “close, but not close enough” to being cleared. Because he was unable to practice at all, the team opted to hold him out and keep him in San Francisco to continue rehabbing rather than traveling to Indianapolis.The timing stings. Pearsall is coming off his most productive game of the season, catching six passes for a game-high 96 yards from Brock Purdy in the 37-24 victory over the Titans.Through eight games this season, the former first-round pick has totaled 31 receptions for 443 yards and is still searching for his first touchdown.With Pearsall sidelined, Kendrick Bourne and Demarcus Robinson are expected to see expanded roles in the receiving rotation. San Francisco will lean on its depth as it takes the field at Lucas Oil Stadium for an 8:15 p.m. ET kickoff, knowing it will have to adjust on the fly without one of its most efficient targets from a week ago.The San Francisco 49ers and Indianapolis Colts will face off on Monday, Dec. 22, at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis. Kickoff is scheduled for 8:15 p.m. ET.The game will air nationally on ESPN and ABC as part of Monday Night Football. Fans can also stream the matchup on ESPN+ and NFL+.",Ricky Pearsall was one of the biggest reasons the 49ers offense looked sharp last week.

Why limited cap space remains biggest obstacle to Hughes brothers' reunion at New Jersey Devils,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/why-limited-cap-space-remains-biggest-obstacle-to-hughes-brothers-reunion-at-new-jersey-devils/articleshow/126123735.cms,"New Jersey Devils in the latest season

New Jersey Devils don’t have the cap space to acquire Quinn Hughes

NHL Highlights | Sabres vs. Devils - December 21, 2025

The New Jersey Devils have Jack and Luke Hughes. That's already a luxury most teams can't afford. Adding Quinn Hughes to complete the set would be a dream scenario for fans and a nightmare for the front office trying to build a championship roster under the salary cap.The math simply doesn't work. Jack Hughes carries an $8 million cap hit through the 2029-30 season. Luke just signed a seven-year extension worth $9 million per season. That's $17 million committed to two players before you even start thinking about adding their older brother.For context, that's already more than 20 percent of the salary cap tied up in two forwards who play the same position. Building a contender means spreading money across four lines, three defensive pairs, two goaltenders, and enough depth to survive injuries. The Devils are already working with reduced flexibility.When Quinn signs his next contract, whether it's with Minnesota or another team, he'll be looking at annual compensation in the $15 million to $18 million range. He's one of the best defensemen in the NHL and will be paid accordingly.Add that to the $17 million already committed to Jack and Luke, and the Devils would have over $30 million tied up in three players.That's more than a third of the salary cap devoted to the Hughes family. For New Jersey to even consider adding Quinn, they'd need to move a significant salary elsewhere.That means trading quality players with value, not just dumping bad contracts. To make the cap work, the Devils would have to give up roster depth and possibly mortgage their future. Even yet, you are left with a squad that is dominated by the best players and lacks the supporting cast necessary to contend for a Stanley Cup.Championship teams are built on depth, not star power alone. There's another complication beyond the cap. Luke Hughes is developing into the Devils' number one defenseman and power-play quarterback. Adding Quinn would disrupt that development and force one of them into a reduced role.Quinn reportedly doesn't want to interfere with Luke's growth, which makes sense from a family perspective, even if it disappoints fans hoping for a reunion. The idea of all three Hughes brothers playing together in New Jersey is appealing on an emotional level.But the salary cap is designed specifically to prevent teams from stockpiling elite talent, and $30-plus million for three players violates every principle of smart roster construction. Limited cap space isn't just an obstacle. It's the wall that makes a Hughes family reunion in New Jersey nearly impossible.",New Jersey Devils don't have the cap space to acquire Quinn Hughes.

Detroit Lions QB Jared Goff’s wife Christen reveals how motherhood inspired a complete makeover of both family homes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/detroit-lions-qb-jared-goffs-wife-christen-reveals-how-motherhood-inspired-a-complete-makeover-of-both-family-homes/articleshow/126112162.cms,"Jared Goff wife (Instagram and Getty Images)

Jared Goff ’s wife, Christen, creates two homes with one heart

Lions star Jared Goff’s wife, Christen, stepped into motherhood with the same intention she brings to every part of her life. Since welcoming daughter Romy, her days have been shaped by movement between two cities, two homes, and one new priority. While her husband leads the Detroit Lions on the field, Christen has been quietly redefining what home means during one of the biggest transitions of her life.Life now unfolds between Los Angeles and Michigan, places tied deeply to the couple’s journey. One carries the rhythm of the ocean, the other the warmth of Midwest winters. With a newborn in tow, those spaces needed to feel safe, calm, and deeply personal. Christen approached that challenge not as a checklist, but as an emotional reset that reflects who they are becoming as a family.For Christen Goff, adapting both houses meant honoring their personalities while making room for Romy. She openly admits she is learning as she goes, sharing, “We’re so lucky to be able to live in two different places.” In California, where she grew up, the home leans into light and air. “I grew up in California, and there, we live by the beach, so our house kind of reflects that,” she says. “We live steps away from the ocean so our house definitely has more of a coastal feel, very indoor-outdoor, which we love.ID@undefinedCaption not available.ID@undefinedCaption not available.ID@undefinedCaption not available.Michigan tells a different story. “And then here in Michigan, our house is a little bit more cozy, kind of farmhouse country. We always have the fireplace going, even in the summer, which is kind of insane, but I would say that this house is so cozy and it just makes me want to cuddle up on the couch and watch a movie.” Each space now includes a nursery that mirrors its surroundings. “In L.A., it’s, like, boho, Bohemian,” she explains. “We have some fun antiques in there.” Michigan’s nursery leans softer. “And then this one is a little more classy,” she says. “Her nursery is so sweet here. It's very, like, muted pink tones. I went full into the girly pink.”As the holidays approach, Michigan will host Romy’s first Christmas. “We are here in Michigan through this season, so we're here, we'll be celebrating here, which is great,” Christen says, adding, “I love a California Christmas by the beach, but nothing beats a fireplace rolling with snow outside and your Christmas tree lit.”Behind the scenes, motherhood has brought exhaustion and joy in equal measure. “I feel like it's a roller coaster a bit,” she admits. Laundry piles up, routines shift, and patience gets tested. Still, perspective grounds her. “My key is chipping away day by day at everything,” she explains. “Just doing what you can and giving yourself grace.”In this season, Christen has found belonging in a new circle. “I feel like I'm part of this new club of women and we all have something in common,” she says. “Moms are superheroes.”Also Read: Travis Hunter’s wife Leanna turns heads in chic white bikini selfie during family birthday celebration","Jared Goff’s wife, Christen, stepped into motherhood with the same intention she brings to every part of her life.

Sophie Cunningham’s future outlook



Sophie Cunningham has never shied away from calling out WNBA’s pay structure. Despite experiencing the most explosive era of its existence, the WNBA’s financial reality for many of its veterans remains a point of sharp contention. As the league celebrates record-breaking viewership and skyrocketing ticket sales, the disconnect between cultural impact and player compensation has reached a boiling point.Amidst high-stakes Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) negotiations, players are increasingly vocal about the league not paying them enough, and that is very well seen when comparing NBA’s highest $59.6 million for 2025-26 with WNBA’s highesthest $249 thousand for 2025. Cunningham, during her recent appearance on “Sundae Conversations,” sparked a viral conversation about the league's pay scale while hinting at a ""Plan B"" option to secure her future beyond the hardwood.In the Sundae Conversations episode released on December 21, Caleb Pressley interviewed Sophie Cunningham, and the latter didn't hold back when discussing the league contract structure.When asked, “You do get paid?” Cunningham replied, “You know, barely.But we’re still surviving.” She gave a hearty laugh when asked if there’s a “Plan B” if WNBA sc**ws over and clarified it is “Not plan B but project B.” Project B is a new global basketball league that will commence in 2026. According to co-founder Grady Burnett, Project B represents “the best basketball in the world.”The interview turned in an interesting direction when the host, Caleb, asked, “Do you think you even need the league or could you just make money on only fans?” Cunningham, emphasizing the leagues’ existence, replied, “No, I think you do need the leagues because that’s what gives you the platform to have all these fans.” She also added, “Maybe plan B should support that (only fans) platform.The shift toward ""Project B"" highlights a growing trend of WNBA athletes seeking equity and massive cash infusions that the traditional league structure currently lacks. For 2025, the average WNBA salary is around $102,000. This forces the players to turn towards entrepreneurial options. For someone with the brand power of Sophie Cunningham, who was the only WNBA star on Google’s trend list for 2025, this means looking at every available avenue. Platforms like OnlyFans, which several athletes have used to exert total control over their likeness and revenue, remain a potential option.For the 2026 season, the new CBA rules might push the average salary over $500K but these alternative ventures aren't just about extra cash, but a step toward securing a future beyond the underwhelming cheques.Also read: Sophie Cunningham spills beans on Caitlin Clark snubbing “Project B” invite, raising questions about WNBA","Sophie Cunningham has never shied away from calling out WNBA’s pay structure.

Maple Leafs fans on edge after reporter claims Auston Matthews trade talks may be closer than believed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/maple-leafs-fans-on-edge-after-reporter-claims-auston-matthews-trade-talks-may-be-closer-than-believed/articleshow/126059895.cms,"Auston Matthews trade rumor (Getty Images)

Auston Matthews and the pressure point Toronto cannot ignore

The mood around the Maple Leafs has shifted from confidence to caution. Toronto entered the season expecting its captain to set the pace, yet nights now pass where the scoreboard stays silent for stretches that feel unfamiliar. Auston Matthews still generates chances, still competes hard in all three zones, but goals no longer arrive with the same inevitability. In a market that measures greatness shift by shift, that absence has grown louder than any cheer.What makes this moment heavier is timing. Toronto is not rebuilding or experimenting. This is a team built to win now. When production stalls at the center of that plan, anxiety spreads quickly. Conversations that once felt unthinkable are now whispered openly, not because Matthews has fallen off, but because expectations around him remain sky high.The tension spiked when Maple Leafs reporter Howard Berger suggested the organization will not move forward until Auston Matthews asks for a trade, possibly by this year’s trade deadline. That idea alone rattled the fanbase. Matthews has been the franchise constant for nearly a decade.Imagining Toronto without him feels like pulling a load-bearing wall from the house.On the ice, the frustration has roots. Auston Matthews continues to win faceoffs, backcheck, and handle defensive responsibility. Yet Toronto pays him to swing games offensively. At five-on-five, his line has not consistently owned shifts. On the power play, the dominance that once felt automatic has faded into predictability. The looks are there, but the finish has gone missing.That gap between effort and outcome feeds scrutiny. In Toronto, leadership is judged through goals when the stakes rise. When scoring dries up, every shift becomes a test of authority and legacy. Nick Kypreos tried to strike a more hopeful tone in the Toronto Star, but optimism struggles to breathe when results lag behind reputation.The coaching staff has searched for answers. Different wingers, altered looks, and tactical tweaks have come and gone. The puck still moves well, but the instinctive scoring touch that defined Matthews has not returned with consistency. There is also quiet talk of tension with coach Craig Berube, another layer that complicates an already delicate situation.Trading a captain in his prime is not standard practice. Neither is standing still while doubt grows inside a contender. Toronto management now faces a narrow path where action and inaction both carry consequences. Whether Berger’s report proves prophetic or premature, it captures how fragile this stretch feels.Matthews remains elite. Yet in this market, elite alone no longer settles the noise. The next few months will decide more than standings. They will define how this era is remembered, and whether Auston Matthews and Toronto find clarity together or part under pressure. Maple Lead's season has not been up to their mark and there will be few shake-up in near future.Also Read: Are Auston Matthews and Craig Berube drifting apart as Maple Leafs struggles spark tense locker-room speculation?","The mood around the Maple Leafs has shifted from confidence to caution.

Everything to know about Brittani, the woman keeping the Steelers QB grounded

For two decades, Aaron Rodgers has lived under a microscope where every throw, feud, and relationship was pulled into public view. Fame followed him everywhere, often blurring the line between his professional brilliance and personal choices. Yet this offseason delivered a surprise no one saw coming. The Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback quietly arrived at training camp wearing a wedding ring, setting off whispers and questions that even seasoned reporters did not anticipate.Rodgers confirmed the news himself. He was married. Not in a splashy ceremony or magazine reveal, but in the most Rodgers way possible, calm and guarded. The identity of his wife stayed mostly out of reach, though one name surfaced quietly. Brittani. And in a career filled with noise, this silence spoke volumes.Aaron Rodgers has made it clear that this chapter of his life is different. Older, more reflective, and more intentional, he no longer treats his private world as public property. During Steelers training camp, he explained how marriage reshaped his outlook, both on and off the field.“When you meet the right one, and you’re with the right one, your whole world changes in a second,” Rodgers told NFL Network’s Kyle Brandt at Steelers training camp this summer.“To have that person who unconditionally loves you behind the scenes, there’s no better feeling. I’ve got the most incredible wife. I just really love her. I’m so thankful to have her by my side at the end. When you have that stability and rock behind you at the house, you feel like you can do anything. ”That sense of grounding did not appear overnight. Rodgers’ past relationships played out loudly. From Olivia Munn to Danica Patrick to Shailene Woodley, each connection carried attention, speculation, and eventually pain. Patrick later accused him of being “emotionally abusive.” Woodley reflected on their breakup with quiet sorrow, saying, “I haven’t shared much about my relationship with Aaron because it always makes me cry. It was not right. But it was beautiful.”Aaron Rodgers has not dodged accountability. In his 2024 Netflix documentary, he admitted, “I didn’t do myself any favors with some of the girls I dated after that that were in the public eye.”With Brittani, the approach changed. She avoids the spotlight entirely. Rodgers explained the reason plainly on “The Pat McAfee Show.” “It’s a sick society, isn’t it? I lived in the public eye for 20 years. I had a public relationship. How did that work out? Now I’m with somebody’s who private, who doesn’t want to be in the public eye, didn’t sign up to be a celebrity.”That privacy seems to have unlocked peace. Teammates see a calmer leader. Coaches see focus. Fans see a quarterback who looks settled at last. As Aaron Rodgers enters what could be his final NFL chapter, Brittani’s quiet presence may be the steady force that keeps his world balanced, even as the stadium lights burn brighter than ever.Also Read: Who is Josh Johnson, the Commanders’ emergency QB whose NFL resume includes stops with nearly half the league","Aaron Rodgers has kept his wife out of the spotlight.

NEW DELHI: India’s baby-faced batting sensation Vaibhav Sooryavanshi had a tough time during the Under-19 Asia Cup 2025 final against Pakistan on Sunday.As Pakistan beat India to clinch the title, an off-the-field incident caught attention on social media.A video showed some Pakistan fans outside the stadium booing Sooryavanshi as he walked past them.Despite the negativity, the teenager remained calm as he did not react or say anything and walked away quietly.Watch:With emotions running high and pressure being intense, India faced their biggest rivals in the final at the ICC Academy Ground in Dubai.Batting first, Pakistan put up a huge score of 347 runs, thanks to the heroics of Sameer Minhas, who played a brilliant knock of 172 runs from just 113 balls. The target was always going to be difficult for India.India’s chase started poorly. Opener Ayush Mhatre was dismissed very early for just two runs. Much was expected from 14-year-old Vaibhav Sooryavanshi, who has been one of India’s standout performers in the tournament.Vaibhav began confidently and showed no fear. He attacked the bowlers from the first ball and played some exciting shots. He quickly raced to 26 runs off only nine balls, giving Indian fans some hope.However, the young batter failed to convert his start into a big innings. While attempting an aggressive shot against pacer Ali Raza, he edged the ball to the wicketkeeper and was dismissed.India’s early collapse hurt their chances badly, and the team eventually lost the final. There was also a heated moment when Sooryavanshi appeared to exchange words with Ali Raza after getting out.After being bundled out for 156 in 26.2 overs, India went on to lose the game by 191 runs. And the final loss was disappointing, but Sooryavanshi had a strong tournament overall.He started the Asia Cup with a stunning 171 runs off 95 balls against the UAE. He then scored a half-century against Malaysia. However, his form dipped in the knockout matches against Sri Lanka and Pakistan.Vaibhav scored 261 runs in five innings.

Why Rohit Sharma got really emotional at a promotional event

Poll Do you agree with Amit Mishra's views on judging fitness based on appearance? Strongly Agree Agree Disagree

NEW DELHI: Rohit Sharma 's renewed focus on fitness has silenced lingering doubts about his place in India's ODI set-up, with former spinner Amit Mishra strongly backing the Indian opener and challenging conventional perceptions around body type and athleticism.Questions around Rohit's conditioning had resurfaced despite his outstanding leadership and batting during India's Champions Trophy triumph. With an eye on the next ODI World Cup in 2027, the former Indian skipper used his break time from cricket to take matters into his own hands, working closely with a former India assistant coach on his fitness. The effort resulted in Rohit shedding close to 10 kilograms, and he has looked visibly leaner and sharper recently.However, Mishra believes the narrative around Rohit's fitness has long been misplaced. Speaking on MensXP, the veteran leg-spinner said Rohit was always capable on the field, even when labelled “heavy” by critics.“Rohit Sharma has made a comeback and is fit. He was fit before as well. I have played with him. People called him heavy but I never felt that he was slow on the field or could not score runs. It was not like he would bat and go out, he would field as well and was active.Everyone have their opinion and perspective,” Mishra said.Mishra used Rohit's example to broaden the debate on fitness, stressing that people often judge players by appearance rather than output or durability.“Everybody's body is not the same. There is a difference. The type is different. Fitness is judged more on looks these days — to look lean,” he said. “It is better to have a genuine body and maintain your fitness. Eat well, work hard, you will stay fit. Take care of your diet and do things naturally.”The former India spinner also warned against short-term transformations driven by optics rather than sustainability. “Don't be fit to just look fit. There are many examples of those who made themselves look fit in a short time, I will not take names, but later they have faced many issues with their body,” Mishra noted, adding that good sleep, natural training, outdoor running and the right mindset were just as important as gym work.Rohit's performances have matched his physical transformation. In the recently concluded ODI series against Australia, he was named Player of the Tournament after scoring 202 runs, including a century in Sydney. Against South Africa at home, he followed it up with 146 runs.",Rohit Sharma's renewed focus on fitness has silenced lingering doubts about his place in India's ODI set-up.

Suryakumar Yadav talks about his horrible form with the bat | T20 World Cup

Indian star batter Smriti Mandhana created history during the first Women’s T20I match against Sri Lanka in Visakhapatnam on Sunday. The left-handed opener achieved a major milestone and entered an elite list in women’s T20 international cricket.Mandhana became the first Indian woman cricketer to score more than 4,000 runs in T20Is. This is a huge achievement for Indian cricket Overall, she is only the second woman in the world to reach this landmark.New Zealand legend Suzie Bates is the only other player to do so and currently has 4,716 runs in the format.What makes Mandhana’s record even more special is the speed at which she achieved it. She reached the 4,000-run mark in just 3,227 balls, which is faster than Suzie Bates, who took 3,675 balls to get there.This shows how consistent and attacking Mandhana has been over the years in T20 cricket.In the match against Sri Lanka, Mandhana scored 25 runs off 25 balls. She was dismissed in the ninth over while chasing a target of 122 runs.Even though her innings was short, it was enough for her to reach the historic milestone.This was also her first international appearance since India’s famous win in the ODI World Cup final last month, where they defeated South Africa to lift their maiden title.Earlier in the match, the Indian bowlers delivered a disciplined performance and restricted Sri Lanka to 121 runs for six wickets. The Sri Lankan batters struggled to take advantage of loose deliveries and failed to build strong partnerships.Opener Vishmi Gunaratne was the top scorer for Sri Lanka with 39 runs off 43 balls. Hasini Perera and Harshitha Samarawickrama also contributed with scores of 20 and 21 respectively.Sri Lanka captain Chamari Athapaththu started aggressively but was dismissed by young pacer Kranti Gaud, giving India an early breakthrough.India’s bowlers kept things tight in the middle overs despite the presence of dew, which made gripping the ball difficult.Deepti Sharma bowled economically, while debutant Vaishnavi Sharma impressed everyone with a calm and controlled spell and gave away very few runs.","Smriti Mandhana becomes first Indian woman cricketer to score more than 4,000 runs in T20Is.

Caught on the wrong foot: Did Shubman Gill pay the price for India's T20 misadventures?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/caught-on-the-wrong-foot-did-shubman-gill-pay-the-price-for-indias-t20-misadventures/articleshow/126132720.cms,"Shubman Gill

As the Test & ODI captain comes to terms with his recent axing from the World Cup squad, questions swirl around whether it was really necessary to induct him in an already-strong lineup.

Perhaps, the whole unsavoury saga could have been avoided...

Inside story of why Shubman Gill was DROPPED from India T20I World Cup squad

Five months ago, the world was a beautiful place for Shubman Gill . All that he touched turned into gold. He scored 754 runs in the Test series against England, was pitchforked to the Test and ODI captaincy and was even made vice-captain in the T20 format.At the end of the year, though, the stylish 26-year-old is walking a lonely path. T20s are the flavour of the season but Gill, who has been projected as the new pin-up face of Indian cricket, will suddenly be out of work during a World Cup at home that's going to rule the head and heart of cricket fans over the next couple of months.After suffering a serious neck strain during the South Africa Test series, Gill ran against time to be fit for the T20I leg of the series. He might have got the hint that he needed to prove himself in T20Is all over again to hold on to his India place. But scores of 4, 0 and 28 in the first three games, followed by a toe injury, finished his hopes of hanging on to his spot. Rejection in T20Is is nothing new to Gill — despite being one of the leading IPL players, he was kept out of the 2024 T20 World Cup that India went on to win.It was a major disappointment and he may have been looking to make amends since.As Gill tries to deal with this recent humiliation, it begs the question — was it really necessary to try and fit him into a system that was not broken in the first place? Abhishek Sharma and Sanju Samson were batting like a dream as openers in T20Is. Also, one need not be a cricket analyst to understand that Yashasvi Jaiswal is a more explosive T20 batter than Gill. Still, the Indian cricket hierarchy felt it was necessary to find a new all-format leadership face and that's why Gill was not only brought back but given the vice-captaincy too.WV Raman, a former India batter who coached the women's team, feels that is where the decision-makers missed a trick. “Gill hasn't been dropped for any significant fault of his. Just that the players around him are more explosive than him, a quality that is essential in modern-day T20 cricket. In an imaginary scenario, it is almost like choosing K Srikkanth over Sunil Gavaskar for the T20 format, knowing full well who the better batter in the format actually could be. That's why I was wondering why it was necessary to make him the T20 vice-captain at that stage, when so many others fit the T20 bill so well,” Raman told TOI.Prior to the England Tests, Gill had worked on his batting technique, whereby his bat was coming down a lot straighter than it was doing during the Australia series or before that. There's a school of thought that believes the tweak in technique restricted him a little while playing the kind of horizontal bat shots required in T20Is. While Gill became a much tighter Test batter, as we saw in England, his range of shots in T20 cricket took a hit. The fact that Gill's career strike-rate of 138.59 in T20Is has come down to 127.65 in the last 10 T20Is adds credence to the theory.But Raman doesn't buy the idea completely. “Rohit Sharma plays with a straight bat, but does that restrict his hitting? Sometimes a straight bat opens up more scoring options even in T20 cricket. It is more about who you are as a player and we have to admit that some of the others around him are naturally more explosive,” he said.Where does that leave Gill the player and captain in the other two formats? If sources are to be believed, the star right-hander wasn't told until just before the selection meeting that he would be dropped. For a player of his stature, that's probably not the best since Gill will be working with the same coaching staff and selection committee in the days to come. After showing so much faith, this sudden snub for a talent like Gill may well bring in a sense of insecurity for the player. He is well within his right to ask why captain Suryakumar Yadav , whose batting average is 13.62 in 2025, is getting a look-in ahead of him.Raman feels “what's done is done” and it is crucial that Gill tries to insulate himself from the toxicity that is swirling around him. “If I was his coach, I would have told him that there is no place for emotion in a player's life. It is a decision that has been taken with the team composition in mind and Gill should not think for a second that he has become a lesser player,” Raman said.It's for Gill to understand that there's life beyond the glitter of T20 cricket and he can still be India's best batter in the other two formats.",Gill scored 754 runs in the Test series against England and was made vice- captain in the T20 format. The stylish 26-year-old is walking a lonely path. Gill's career strike-rate of 138.59 in T20Is has come down to 127.65 in the last 10 T20s.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126132762,imgsize-44868,width-400,resizemode-4/shubman-gill.jpg"

The 2025 season was a landmark chapter for WNBA since its commencement. From record-breaking viewership ratings to its rapid yet sturdy expansion to a global level, the WNBA saw some of the best offensive talents this year. Each talent raised the bar, showcasing a blend of explosive drives, jump shots, or shooting from the arc. This was a testament to the league’s evolution and rising demand for top-notch skills.These five players showcased their dominance not just from the paint but with elite perimeter shooting and redefined what it means to be a bucket-getter in the modern era.A’ja Wilson made 2025 her season. From winning her 4th MVP, third WNBA championship, and finishing it with being the highest scorer in both average with 23.4 points per game and 937 total points, Wilson showcased her dominant skill set on the hardwood. Equipped with the ability to score from the field (50.5%), Wilson was nearly impossible to guard.After 2024’s historic DPOY win, Napheesa Collier has yet another great season in 2025. Colliers served as the key element in leading the Lynx to the No.1 overall seed in this season’s playoffs with a record of 34-10. She averaged nearly 23 points per game, while recording 7.3 rebounds and 3.2 assists with 1.6 steals while shooting 53.1% from the field.Napheesa Collier was literally everywhere. From drive-ins, jumpers, to shooting, Collier’s versatility is her greatest weapon. But Collier’s influence also extended beyond the court this season as she remained a prominent figure to speak for player rights and against WNBA’s pay structure.Kelsey Mitchell registered a phenomenal 2025 with Indiana Fever. Mitchell stepped up after Caitlin Clark was sidelined due to an injury and led the Fever to a 24-20 season while averaging 20.2 points, 3.4 assists, and 1.8 rebounds. She shot 42.8% from the field, 42.9% from the arc, and 86.7 from the free throw line. Her lightning-quick release and ability to create her own shot under pressure provided Indiana with a reliable scoring option during tight fourth-quarter stretches.Kelsey Plum was traded from Aces to Sparks in early 2025 as part of a blockbuster deal. Plum brought her veteran leadership and experience to the Sparks roster to help the young stars like Cameron Brink and Rickea Jackson. For the 2025 season, Plum’s 19.5 points per game were fueled by her 35.5% shots from beyond the arc. She also registered 3.1 rebounds and 5.7 assists per game. Despite the transition, Kelsey Plum remained one of the league’s most consistent scorers, providing the veteran leadership and spacing necessary for the Sparks' offensive schemes.The first overall pick of the 2025 draft, Paige Bueckers, is proving herself amongst these veterans on the court. The rookie made a sensational entry in the league and silenced everyone who questioned her skills or position. With 19.2 points, 5.4 assists, and 3.9 rebounds while shooting 47.7% from the field, Bueckers secured the 2025 WNBA Rookie of the Year receiving 70 out of 72 votes, and also became the fastest rookie to ever reach 500 points and 100 assists.Leading the Dallas Wings, Bueckers has showcased incredible basketball IQ and scoring touch from hitting the ""clutch"" shots or navigating pick-and-rolls.

Patriots take down Ravens in week 16: Stefon Diggs leads the charge while Cardi B takes savage shot at Baltimore,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/patriots-take-down-ravens-in-week-16-stefon-diggs-leads-the-charge-while-cardi-b-takes-savage-shot-at-baltimore/articleshow/126125926.cms,"Cardi B reacts after Patriots’ win over Ravens (Image via: Getty Images)

Stefon Diggs helps Patriots turn the page toward a key Week 17 clash against the Jets



The New England Patriots needed a big-game performance, and Stefon Diggs delivered exactly that in a tense Week 16 showdown against the Baltimore Ravens. New England edged out a 28-24 victory on Sunday night, a result that carried serious playoff weight and underlined why Diggs has become such a crucial part of this Patriots offense. He finished with nine receptions for 138 yards, constantly creating separation and coming up with key moments when the Patriots needed stability.What unfolded after the game nearly matched the intensity of what happened on the field. Cardi B , Diggs’ girlfriend, found herself at the center of a viral moment when a video surfaced of her taking a swipe at Baltimore. Her blunt “Y’all going to Cancun” jab quickly took over social media, turning a hard-fought football result into a talking point that stretched beyond the sport.Once the noise settles, the real story for New England is what this win means. The Patriots now sit on 12 wins, looking composed, confident, and increasingly dangerous as the season heads toward its most demanding stretch. Diggs’ impact is fixed: his timing with the offense has sharpened, his physicality at the catch point continues to bother defenses, and his presence forces opponents to adjust their coverage in ways that keep New England in control.Attention now turns to Week 17 and a familiar AFC East battle against the New York Jets at MetLife Stadium. It’s scheduled for Sunday at 1 p.m. ET in East Rutherford, and while it’s another rivalry meeting on paper, it carries more than just bragging rights. The Patriots will be looking to keep momentum rolling, while the Jets will be desperate to disrupt it.For Diggs, games like the one against Baltimore define seasons. Performances loaded with consistency, composure, and production build trust heading into January football. The Ravens leave this one frustrated, but New England walks away with something more valuable than headlines: a statement win, a clear sense of direction, and a receiver who keeps proving why he changes football games, not just conversations.Also Read: Cardi B's surprise appearance at Stefon Diggs' Wellness Wonderland had fans talking all night","New England Patriots beat Baltimore Ravens 28-24 on Sunday night.

I am scared. If this continues, I may have to leave soon: Foreign footballer

NEW DELHI: A video showing BJP councillor from Patparganj ward Renu Chaudhary confronting a foreign national in a Delhi public park and berating him for not speaking Hindi has gone viral, triggering widespread criticism on social media.In the clip, Chaudhary questions the man for not learning Hindi despite living in India and warns him of consequences if he fails to do so. In another moment, the councillor points at someone, away from camera, invokes park rules, and says that the park must shut by 8pm and warns that any criminal activity would make those present responsible. The foreign national told TOI he first came to India 12 years ago in search of opportunities and joined a football academy, where he taught children in local parks.We used to have 40-45 students every session. It was a joy. Everything was going smoothly until Covid hit,"" he said, seeking anonymity for his safety.After the pandemic led to the academy's closure, he resumed coaching independently, this time focusing on underprivileged children. ""Since 2022, I've chosen kids with talent but no resources, giving them jerseys and sending them for competitions.Many have gone on to become army officers and policemen,"" he said.The foreign national said the incident happened on Dec 13, while he was in the park playing football with Indian friends for leisure. ""At first, I took it as a joke; she seemed like a nice lady. But then she kept repeating it,"" he said, adding the episode left him shaken. ""I am scared. If this continues, I may have to leave soon.""Responding to the row, Chaudhary said the park was used for coaching children for commercial purposes without paying dues or obtaining permission from MCD. ""There are no fixed timings for the coaching sessions. On several occasions, our staff tried to communicate with the coach, but due to a language barrier, it was difficult,"" said Chaudhary, a first-time BJP councillor from Patparganj ward.She added that following staff complaints, she raised the issue with the coach about eight months ago and asked him to learn Hindi to enable communication with sanitation workers, who do not understand other languages. ""Although it is a ground, MCD needs the space to remain clean and must be informed when it is occupied. Locals say classes have been held there for 10-12 years, but as a councillor, I want everything to be in order for security and other reasons,"" she said.Residents in the city weighed in on the broader language debate sparked by the video. Sarthak Garg, a resident of Sadar Apartments in Mayur Vihar Phase 1, said Indians often fail to reflect on their own linguistic behaviour while living in other states.""People should spend time in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu or Karnataka, and see how many Hindi-speaking migrants have lived there for decades without learning a few words of the local language. Before telling a foreigner to learn Hindi, Indians should ask themselves if they make an effort to learn Telugu, Tamil, Kannada, Bengali or Marathi,"" he said. Social media echoed similar sentiments. One user wrote: ""Cringe! The virus has reached Delhi after Bengaluru and Mumbai. ""","Video shows BJP councillor Renu Chaudhary berating a foreign national in a Delhi public park.

Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones takes the blame for the 30-year Super Bowl drought in the postgame press conference and praises Brian Schottenheimer for his efforts

At the pre-game conference after the Week 15 loss to the Los Angeles Chargers, which eliminated the 2025 NFL playoff chances, Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott said he loves his job. Last year, when he didn’t play, he realized that playing cannot be taken for granted. He said every game is played to win, enter the playoffs, or reach the Super Bowl, but that might not always happen. He expressed gratitude for the opportunity to play and said he would never pass it up, no matter what.Prescott said that when players enter the gridiron, they control what they can, which is always the team’s effort to win. He expressed gratitude for being able to play in the NFL and said it was fortunate to get that chance, especially with his teammates. The team won’t be the same next year, so it’s about enjoying every game.After losing to the Philadelphia Eagles in Week 16 and being eliminated from the 2025 NFL Playoffs, Prescott said at the postgame press conference that, given the sacrifices and hard work of each player, he didn’t want anyone to cheat the game. He said Cowboys defensive tackle Osa Odighizuwa summed it up best. Nothing was promised, and the Cowboys still had two weeks left.Prescott added that he wanted each Cowboys player to give their best in every game and cherish the moments they spend together on the gridiron because the team may not be the same next year.“This is my job, this is what I love to do,” Prescott said via NFL Network on December 18. “Sitting out last year and the times before, you don’t take getting to play this game for granted. You play every game to win, you play every game to get a chance to go to the playoffs or play in the Super Bowl, and unfortunately that’s not always the case. If that’s not the case when we take the field or whatever it may be, I’m thankful for the opportunity to play this game and I’m not going to ever pass it up. ”“We got to go out and control what we can control,” Prescott said. “And right now, that’s our effort and that’s trying to get a win. We’re professionals, and we’ve got a job to do at the highest level. This is NFL football, and we’re all fortunate to get a chance to play this game, particularly with the teammates we have in this locker room. It won’t be the same next year, so it’s about going and enjoying every moment.”“This is our job, we’re blessed,” Prescott said via FOX Sports: NFL on X on December 22. “You know how hard we’ve worked and the sacrifices we’ve got to even get to this league, to get to these ten years in for myself, to be healthy. I said it to the team, and I think it was Friday when we’re breaking down or Saturday, whenever, it’s like this game has given us so much, how could you cheat it?I think Osa [Odighizuwa] said it best when he just broke down the team right there after the game, we got two weeks left and nothing’s promised in life, right? Football careers [---] sure aren’t, so nothing in life is like, let’s enjoy these two weeks, cherish these moments, these practices, this time together with the men and brothers that we love and we’ve got an opportunity to play with. This team won’t be the same next year, so let’s enjoy this and give it our best. ”Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones admitted at the postgame press conference that Cowboys management played a major role in the team’s failure to reach a conference championship in 30 years. He expressed his disappointment. However, he commended head coach Brian Schottenheimer’s efforts as a first-time coach.“I’ll admit that the Cowboys management has played a big role [in the 30-year Super Bowl drought],” Jones said at the postgame press conference via Garrett Podell of CBS Sports. “But seriously, I’m very disappointed that the way we’re structured, and my role, puts us here tonight. I’m tremendously disappointed. Really, I don’t want to be trite, but the same way that I might have looked at the 30 years before I bought the Cowboys. That was then. This is now.I’ve never looked at something because I haven’t done it in the past as something that’s not possible for us to do. We’re qualified, and we’ve got as good a place to be as you’d probably like to have with where we are with our draft picks.I like the job [Brian] Schottenheimer’s done this year. I think he’s been outstanding. He’s a first-year [head] coach, and he’s covered a lot of ground, not only his duties as head coach, but his duties on the offense and his duties over on the defense as well.”Also Read: “Triggering day for many reasons”: Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott pays a humble tribute to defensive end Marshawn Kneeland","Dak Prescott wants every Dallas Cowboys player to celebrate and give their best in the remaining games.
