NEW DELHI: India’s teen chess sensation Rameshbabu Praggnanandhaa has once again stunned World No. 1 Magnus Carlsen , registering his second victory over the Norwegian great in the Freestyle Chess Grand Slam in Las Vegas. The 19-year-old grandmaster defeated Carlsen in the first classification game of the semi-final, forcing the five-time world champion to resign in 43 moves.Praggnanandhaa, playing with the white pieces, showcased clinical precision and tactical depth. By the 18th move, Carlsen made the bold decision to sacrifice his queen in exchange for a bishop and knight — an attempt to turn the tide — but Praggnanandhaa weathered the challenge and regained the upper hand late in the game. By move 41, the Indian GM had lined up three central pawns and forced Carlsen into a position where checkmate was inevitable, prompting the resignation.This latest triumph adds to Pragg’s growing list of wins over Carlsen. Earlier this week, he had already defeated the Norwegian in 39 moves during the group stages. That win knocked Carlsen into the losers’ bracket, where he eventually lost to Levon Aronian.Praggnanandhaa has now beaten Carlsen multiple times across formats.He first made headlines in 2022 at the Champions Chess Tour, defeating Carlsen at age 16. In 2024, he secured his maiden classical win over the Norwegian at Norway Chess.Despite Carlsen bouncing back to win their semifinal clash (3-1) through blitz tiebreakers (2-0) after splitting the two classical games, Praggnanandhaa’s performance has firmly established him as one of the most promising talents on the global stage.","Rameshbabu Praggnanandhaa has once again stunned World No. 1 Magnus Carlsen.

Dan Rivera mystery: No sign of Annabelle doll in hotel room; paranormalist’s death leaves eerie silence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/dan-rivera-mystery-no-sign-of-annabelle-doll-in-hotel-room-paranormalists-death-leaves-eerie-silence/articleshow/122805414.cms,"



The mystery surrounding the death of American paranormal investigator Dan Rivera has taken a chilling turn, as Pennsylvania authorities confirm that the notorious Annabelle doll was not in the room where he died.But the eerie coincidence has only deepened the unease around his final hours.Rivera, 54, a lead investigator with the Connecticut-based New England Society for Psychic Research (NESPR), was in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, one of America’s most haunted towns, for the Devils on the Run tour, accompanied by none other than Annabelle herself.But by Sunday morning, 13 July, he was found dead in his hotel room.The doll made famous by The Conjuring horror franchise is believed by many to be demonically possessed.Adams County Coroner Francis Dutrow told People on Friday, 18 July, that Annabelle was not in the room at the time when he arrived at the site on Sunday. He further added that the doll had not been in the room at all.Still, the timing of Rivera’s death, while on tour with the infamous artefact, has left believers of the paranormal rattled.According to a report released by Pennsylvania State Police on Wednesday, 16 July, Rivera was discovered by hotel workers in Straban Township.“Nothing unusual or suspicious was observed at the scene,” it said.His cause of death remains under investigation, with autopsy results expected in 8–10 weeks.Dutrow also noted that Rivera had been with colleagues that morning before excusing himself, saying he felt unwell and was heading back to his room, only to never return.To some, it might sound like a tragic coincidence. But to those believing in the story of Annabelle, the circumstances feel almost too chilling to ignore.The doll’s story dates back to 1968, when a young nursing student received it as a gift. What began as minor disturbances quickly escalated into disturbing paranormal activity. A medium later claimed the doll was inhabited by the spirit of a young girl named Annabelle. But when the roommates tried to live peacefully with the doll, it responded with violence.Paranormal legends Ed and Lorraine Warren, founders of NESPR, eventually intervened, identifying the doll as demonically possessed. Since then, Annabelle has been kept locked in a glass case, sealed off from the world, or so it is believed.Dan Rivera had worked with NESPR for over a decade, dedicating his life to investigating what most dare not even whisper. In a heartfelt statement released Tuesday, 15 July, the society said:“Dan was not only a vital part of our team for over a decade, but also a deeply compassionate, loyal, and dedicated friend.”“His integrity, creativity, and generosity defined him. Dan’s passion for the paranormal was rooted in a genuine desire to educate, help, and connect with others — whether through social media, conventions, or investigations with local families seeking understanding and peace.”The doll might have been absent from the room, but its origin is still rattling people over what the cause behind Rivera’s death might have been.","Dan Rivera, 54, was found dead in his hotel room in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, on Sunday, 13 July.

(Imagn Images)

A new chapter begins: William Nylander steps into the spotlight



From rising star to franchise cornerstone: William Nylander’s moment has arrived



In the shadow of Mitch Marner’s exit, a fresh narrative is forming in Toronto — and it’s wearing No. 88. As the Maple Leafs adjust to a new era without their elite playmaker, attention now shifts toward William Nylander. With his infectious charisma and explosive on-ice talent, Nylander isn’t just filling a void — he’s poised to redefine it. Leafs fans, the takeover isn’t coming. It’s already in motion.While much of the buzz in Toronto has always circled Auston Matthews, there's a quiet revolution unfolding with William Nylander. Fresh off a career-best 45-goal season, the Swedish winger is proving he’s not just a scorer but a dynamic playmaker as well. Though his assist count dipped from 58 to 39 last season, the challenge ahead is clear — balance the sniper’s edge with the vision of a premier setup man. If he finds that sweet spot, fans might not miss Marner’s artistry as much as they feared.What makes Nylander even more essential in this post-Marner landscape is his versatility. Under Craig Berube, his deployment offers tantalizing possibilities — either flanking Matthews and Matthew Knies on the top line or generating momentum with veterans like John Tavares and Matias Maccelli on the second.Both combinations position Nylander as a central figure, not just in execution but in leadership.And let’s be honest — at $11.5 million per year, expectations are sky-high. But Nylander has shown he thrives under pressure. His six goals and 15 points in 13 playoff games last spring were not just clutch, they were a message: this isn’t a support player anymore. This is a franchise cornerstone.Nylander’s temperament may just be his secret weapon. Unlike the visibly burdened Marner, Nylander carries himself with a relaxed confidence. “If you’ve been in a dressing room with Nylander... you can’t help but note that he’s a happy guy on the whole.” That steady mindset will be crucial as scrutiny intensifies and the spotlight burns brighter.Raised by an NHL father, Nylander understands what it takes to perform under constant media glare. And now, with Marner gone and expectations higher than ever, the Leafs need him to stay consistent, electrifying, and dependable. He’s been all of that for nearly a decade. There’s every reason to believe he’ll be even more.Nylander isn’t just ready for the spotlight. He was born for it.Also Read: Nazem Kadri’s trade value reportedly at peak: Are the Flames finally ready to pull the trigger?","William Nylander is poised to redefine the Toronto Maple Leafs.

Additionally, he also co-signed the brand-new record, Don't Tap the Glass, last week.Don't Tap the Glass, Tyler, the Creator’s ninth studio album, will be released on Monday, July 21, 2025.

He recently co-signed the new album Don't Tap the Glass, demonstrating his respect for the creator.As soon as the post was uploaded, it swiftly went viral. Although the two legends have acknowledged one another before, this serves as a stark reminder of how their influence transcends all sectors.The singer, however, has a clear philosophy that explains why he favors early-week releases. As per Complex, he explained his point of view in an interview with Nardwuar in 2023. He claimed:“I think we should put music out again on Tuesdays instead of Fridays, for some reasons..My reasoning is, I know people think because of the weekend, they can listen to stuff, and the streams go up. And the streaming people are like, ‘Oh, the streams go up on the weekend!’ But I think it’s a lot of passive listening, at parties or people get the time to go to the gym, so they’re not really listening.”He added:“To work on an album for so long and put so much energy into it and for it to be released at midnight…just seems so disrespectful.”This evolving relationship between LeBron James and Tyler, the Creator, showcases how artists and athletes amplify each other’s cultural influence. Whether or not they have official collaborations planned, the singer’s presence in the NBA icon’s orbit speaks volumes.Also read: LeBron James may retire after 2025-26 season as Los Angeles Lakers delay extension","NBA legend LeBron James co-signed Tyler, the Creator’s album Don't Tap the Glass.

FAQs



1. Why did Mitch Marner leave the Toronto Maple Leafs?

2. What did the Leafs get in return for trading Marner?

3. How much is Mitch Marner's new contract with the Golden Knights worth?

Mitch Marner has officially parted ways with the Toronto Maple Leafs, ending years of speculation. The star winger, often at the center of intense scrutiny in Canada’s hockey capital, has signed a lucrative eight-year, $96 million deal with the Vegas Golden Knights. The blockbuster sign-and-trade deal, finalized just before free agency opened, sent Marner westward in exchange for center Nicolas Roy. But why did all of these happen? A new report hints at the behind-the-scenes story.The writing, it seems, had been on the wall for quite some time. According to NHL insider Chris Johnston, the breaking point between Marner and the Maple Leafs didn’t emerge overnight—it began two seasons ago during the team’s dismal playoff run against the Florida Panthers.“I think it was two years ago and it has nothing to do with Brad Treliving in terms of timing,” Johnston said. “Another series where Mitch Marner didn’t put a lot of points. Took a lot of criticism... I think it was just piling up at that point.”The backlash Marner faced, particularly during a notably awkward interview between Games 3 and 4, painted a clear picture of a player overwhelmed by the pressure. The media glare and relentless fan expectations in Toronto seemed to wear heavily on the 27-year-old winger, gradually straining the relationship beyond repair.While fans speculated over contract disputes and trade rumors, Marner’s motivations went deeper. His move to Vegas isn’t just about money or opportunity—it’s about peace of mind and a chance to chase the Stanley Cup under different circumstances. At a press conference, Marner openly admitted his family played a central role in the decision to change cities.Johnston’s report supported that sentiment: “The split up here on one hand it’s the team and the player, but it’s really the city, the fanbase and maybe the media in some degree... He was becoming less enamored with his life as a Leaf.”For Marner, this isn’t just a career move—it’s a personal evolution. One that he hopes will end not in controversy, but in championship glory.Mitch Marner left due to growing criticism in Toronto and a desire for a better shot at the Stanley Cup with Vegas.The Toronto Maple Leafs received center Nicolas Roy in exchange for Mitch Marner.Marner signed an eight-year, $96 million contract with the Vegas Golden Knights.Also Read: Maple Leafs fans, are you ready for the William Nylander takeover as Mitch Marner’s no longer in the picture","Mitch Marner has officially parted ways with the Toronto Maple Leafs.

FAQs

1. Is Sidney Crosby considering leaving the Pittsburgh Penguins?

2. Why are analysts suggesting Sidney Crosby should be traded?

3. Would the Penguins ever trade Sidney Crosby?



For the first time in years, the unthinkable is being discussed out loud—Sidney Crosby, the face of the Pittsburgh Penguins for nearly two decades, could potentially finish his career elsewhere. That’s the bombshell NHL analyst Justin Cuthbert dropped on The FAN Pregame podcast, citing the Penguins’ recent failure to rebuild around Crosby effectively.Justin Cuthbert argued that Pittsburgh has wasted Sidney Crosby’s late prime by surrounding him with veteran stopgaps instead of younger core pieces. “They missed the opportunity to get better, and around Sidney Crosby to the point now that I think it's very possible,” he said, hinting at the once-taboo idea of a Crosby trade. “They did it with a lot older, veteran-type players,” he added, pointing to moves like acquiring Erik Karlsson instead of building a long-term foundation.Despite missing the playoffs three years in a row, Crosby has managed to score over 90 points in each of those seasons, shouldering the team’s burden and keeping hopes alive. But even his heroics may not be enough to offset the Penguins’ trajectory. “Pittsburgh is not going to be very good for a long time,” Cuthbert said bluntly.“He’s going to age out in that roster to go win somewhere else, is what I think.”The 2026 Winter Olympics are being floated as a possible turning point, with speculation mounting that Crosby may reassess his future based on the team’s direction and whether longtime teammate Evgeni Malkin stays or goes.NHL insider Frank Seravalli also weighed in this week, stating, “He (Crosby) hasn't shown any interest to the Pittsburgh Penguins in moving. And they're sure as heck not going to go ask a franchise icon if he's interested in moving.” Seravalli emphasized that the only way a move would happen is if Crosby initiates it.For now, fans must grapple with a sobering reality: the Crosby-Malkin era may be approaching its emotional final chapter.Also Read: Connor McDavid’s cryptic comments spark panic as Oilers fans fear star could walk in free agency While Sidney Crosby hasn’t shown interest in leaving, NHL analysts believe he might consider it if the Penguins keep struggling.Experts like Justin Cuthbert say the Penguins failed to rebuild around Sidney Crosby and that he's “aging out” of a roster with little chance to win.According to Frank Seravalli, the team won’t suggest a move—any trade would only happen if Sidney Crosby initiates the conversation himself.","Experts like Justin Cuthbert say the Penguins failed to rebuild around Sidney Crosby and that he's “aging out” of a roster with little chance to win.

Why the Los Angeles Clippers might let go of Lopez

Theare reportedly considering a move for ex- Milwaukee Bucks ’ veteran centerin free agency, aiming to add size and shooting around Stephen Curry. With the Bucks likely to let Lopez walk, the Warriors could capitalize on his experience and skill set to bolster their frontcourt. Brook Lopez’s combination of floor-spacing and rim protection fits Golden State’s needs the same things that could draw the Golden State Warriors to Turner could also have them eyeing Lopez, who has a more realistic shot of landing within their price range. He wouldn't be as impactful, obviously, but the 37-year-old still offers an intriguing mix of long-range shooting and close-range defending.- 3-Point Shooting: Averaged 1.8 threes per game at 37.1% accuracy since 2022-23.- Rim Protection: Still a disruptive presence near the basket despite limited mobility.- Veteran Experience: Championship pedigree from his time with Milwaukee.- Pace: Lopez’s slower movement could clash with Golden State’s fast-paced offense.- Defensive Limitations: Struggles to defend outside the paint, which may be exploited in switch-heavy schemes.Brook Lopez would provide the Golden State Warriors with a reliable pick-and-pop option, stretching defenses to open driving lanes for Curry.However, his tendency to take deep threes could disrupt ball movement if not utilized carefully.While not a versatile defender, Lopez’s shot-blocking (2.4 blocks per game in 2022-23) would give Golden State a much-needed interior anchor. The trade-off is his inability to guard quicker forwards on the perimeter.The LA Clippers may consider trading Brook Lopez to the Golden State Warriors due to evolving roster needs, cap flexibility, and Lopez’s high market value. With Ivica Zubac established as the main big and rookie Kon Niederhauser added, Lopez could be expendable. Meanwhile, the Warriors need a rim-protecting, floor-spacing center—Lopez averaged 1.9 blocks and shot 37.3% from three last season. His $18M contract is moveable, and both teams are in win-now mode with aging cores.

ESPN Debate Questions Trae Young’s Value

Rayford Young Responds: “Opinions Are Cheap—Facts Matter”

The Bigger Picture: Media vs. Player Circles

Trae Young by the Numbers

A recent episode of NBA Today has stirred up heated debate in the NBA world, leading to a strong response from, father ofstar. After ESPN aired a segment questioning Young’s worthiness of a max contract, Rayford took to social media to call out both the network and analystfor what he deemed lazy, outdated analysis.On the July 18, 2025 edition of NBA Today, ESPN analysts discussed the future of Trae Young with the Atlanta Hawks as he becomes eligible for a contract extension. Panelists—including former NBA guard Iman Shumpert and insider Bobby Marks—debated whether Young had earned a max deal. The conversation focused heavily on Young’s defensive shortcomings and whether those outweighed his elite offensive skills.Iman Shumpert, never one to shy away from blunt commentary, argued that Young’s defense holds the Atlanta Hawks back, especially in the postseason: “At 6’3”, it’s tough to hide him in certain switchable situations. You want your point guard to at least fight over screens, get in passing lanes, and Trae’s just not there defensively. That hurts your team’s ceiling.”The comments reignited an old debate about Young’s perceived defensive limitations and whether he’s grown enough as a two-way player to anchor a contender.Rayford Young, who’s known for defending his son in public forums, wasn’t about to let the criticism slide. On July 20, he responded on X, calling out both ESPN and Iman Shumpert directly.His frustration centered on what he viewed as a lack of updated insight into his son’s development.“If ESPN and Shumpert would do their homework, they’d see how much Trae’s game has evolved. It’s easy to criticize from the sideline but look at his numbers, his work ethic, and what he means to Atlanta. Opinions are cheap—facts matter.”The post quickly gained traction, with Atlanta Hawks fans rallying around the younger Young. Many pointed to his improved defensive stats, clutch postseason performances, and undeniable offensive production as proof that he’s more than deserving of a max extension.This isn’t the first time Rayford Young has taken issue with national media portrayals of his son—and it likely won’t be the last. He’s long been vocal about what he sees as selective storytelling when it comes to Trae’s on-court effort and off-court leadership. And ESPN, often criticized for sensationalized narratives, remains a frequent target for such backlash.Criticism of Iman Shumpert also echoed a common sentiment: that former players sometimes fall back on dated scouting reports instead of analyzing a player’s actual growth.- 2024-25 Season Averages: Over 25 points and 9 assists per game- Offensive Ranking: Top five in both assists and usage rate- Defensive Metrics: Improvement in defensive rating and activity; Atlanta adjusted its schemes to maximize his impact- Intangibles: Known for leadership, charity work, and strong ties to the Atlanta communityThe back-and-forth is more than just another sports media spat—it reflects a growing trend where players’ families and local communities push back on mainstream narratives. For Atlanta Hawks fans, Rayford’s response isn’t just about protecting Trae—it’s about demanding accuracy and depth from national analysts.Iman Shumpert has yet to reply publicly, though ESPN insiders maintained that NBA Today is a debate-driven show that encourages bold takes and differing perspectives.Also read: Stephen Curry Names $197,230,450 Memphis Grizzlies Star the Most Athletic Player in the NBA—Over His Own Teammate For now, the spotlight remains on Trae Young: whether he earns that max extension, whether his defense continues to improve, and whether national media will finally catch up with the version of him that Atlanta already sees.","A recent episode of NBA Today has stirred up heated debate in the NBA world.

What This Means for the Memphis Grizzlies

Thehave made another under-the-radar move this offseason, signing forwardto a two-way NBA contract. First reported by ESPN’s Shams Charania, the deal adds another layer of depth to a team actively retooling around its young stars following a disappointing 2024-25 campaign.After finishing as a top-3 seed for much of the regular season, the Memphis Grizzlies slipped to the No. 8 spot in the Western Conference standings due to a late-season collapse. They were swiftly swept in the first round by the Oklahoma City Thunder, prompting the franchise to part ways with head coach Taylor Jenkins.That loss also marked a turning point in the Memphis Grizzlies ’ roster construction. In one of the biggest moves of the summer, the team traded away starting shooting guard Desmond Bane, signaling a shift in strategy as the front office pivots to build around Ja Morant and Jaren Jackson Jr.Rather than chasing a blockbuster signing, Memphis appears focused on piecing together a competitive rotation through smart, value-driven acquisitions - Hall being one of them.PJ Hall, 23, is a 6-foot-10 forward who spent last season with the Denver Nuggets . Though his minutes with the Nuggets were limited—just 19 games—his impact was far more noticeable in the G League with the Grand Rapids Gold, where he averaged:Hall also made waves during this year’s Summer League, averaging:The South Carolina native is known for his athleticism, rebounding, and ability to stretch the floor—qualities that translate well to a modern NBA frontcourt.Before entering the NBA, Hall played four seasons at Clemson, where he steadily improved each year. His senior season was especially impressive:- Named First-Team All-ACC- Led Clemson to its first Elite Eight appearance in 34 years- Demonstrated leadership, floor spacing, and high-level reboundingHall’s evolution from a raw freshman to one of the ACC’s top bigs makes him an intriguing developmental prospect.With backup center Jay Huff now signed with the Indiana Pacers , the Memphis Grizzlies had a need for frontcourt depth behind Jackson Jr. and rookie Zach Edey. PJ Hall enters a rotation that also includes Brandon Clarke, and if he adapts quickly, there’s a real chance he could carve out a meaningful backup role.Frontcourt Depth Chart Outlook:This signing aligns with the Memphis Grizzlies’ broader approach this offseason: make smart, flexible moves that complement their existing core. While PJ Hall isn’t a guaranteed rotation player yet, his college pedigree, G League production, and Summer League form suggest untapped potential.Also read: NBA Trade News: Los Angeles Lakers Sign Marcus Smart with a $11 Million Deal; High-Stakes Move for Defensive Reinforcement The 2025-26 season is shaping up as a pivotal year for Memphis.

Shake Milton on the Way Out?

Marcus Smart Brings Edge and Experience

Roster and Cap Implications Still in Play

Mixed Fan Reaction and What’s Next for Shake Milton

Theare exploring another major roster shake-up this offseason. According to ESPN’s Shams Charania, the franchise is planning to waive guard—a move not yet finalized—to create space for the incoming Marcus Smart. The decision underlines the front office’s commitment to revamping the roster with proven veterans and tougher defenders following another disappointing postseason exit.Shake Milton, 27, had a brief and quiet stint in Los Angeles after arriving midway through the 2024-25 season. Splitting his time between the Brooklyn Nets and the Los Angeles Lakers , he averaged 5.5 points, 1.8 rebounds, and 1.8 assists per game while shooting 45.3% from the floor and 35.8% from beyond the arc. While those numbers are solid for a bench player, this decision is more about salary cap logistics than performance.Shake Milton’s $3 million salary for the 2025-26 season would have become fully guaranteed after July 20, which added urgency to the Los Angeles Lakers’ timetable. With other moves in the pipeline, including the expected addition of Marcus Smart, LA was unwilling to carry Milton’s salary past that date.While he hasn’t officially been waived, league insiders suggest the writing is on the wall.The anticipated arrival of Marcus Smart, who agreed to a buyout with the Washington Wizards , is the key reason behind Shake Milton’s potential exit. Smart is expected to join the Los Angeles Lakers on a two-year, $11 million contract, bringing elite perimeter defense, grit, and playoff-tested leadership to a team that’s struggled with consistency on that end.Marcus Smart’s recent journey has been riddled with setbacks. After being traded from Boston to Memphis, he played just 26 games over two injury-plagued seasons before a brief stint in Washington. Despite those challenges, the Lakers are banking on his ability to bounce back and play a significant role—especially in a locker room that needs more vocal leadership.Even with the Smart deal on the table, the Los Angeles Lakers aren’t in the clear just yet. Finalizing the move depends on creating the necessary cap flexibility, as the team hovers near the hard cap. Waiving Shake Milton is just the first step. The Lakers may also need to part ways with another non-guaranteed contract or engineer a small trade to remain compliant with the league’s tight financial constraints.This is the new reality under the NBA’s updated Collective Bargaining Agreement—every dollar and roster spot matters. The Lakers’ front office, led by Rob Pelinka, is navigating this chessboard carefully, aiming to load the roster with playoff-ready contributors without overcommitting financially.Los Angeles Lakers fans have largely welcomed the idea of bringing in Marcus Smart, viewing it as an upgrade over Milton. His reputation as a defensive stopper and emotional leader fits what the team lacked last season. That said, there’s still respect for Milton’s professionalism, and many believe he could find a new home soon—potentially with a contender in need of backcourt depth, such as the Bucks, Timberwolves, or Mavericks.This potential roster move reflects LA’s bigger vision: prioritizing veterans who can contribute immediately. If Smart stays healthy and returns to his All-Defensive form, the Lakers may have added a crucial piece to support LeBron James and Anthony Davis. However, the risk remains high given Marcus Smart’s recent injury history and the Los Angeles Lakers’ limited flexibility.Also read: NBA Trade News: Los Angeles Lakers Sign Marcus Smart with a $11 Million Deal; High-Stakes Move for Defensive Reinforcement Whether or not the gamble pays off, one thing’s certain—the Lakers are not standing still.

3. What does Travis Kelce’s response suggest about their relationship dynamic?

As Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce gears up for training camp, he and his brother Jason Kelce are temporarily pressing pause on their wildly successful New Heights podcast. Jason explained how training camp makes podcasting nearly impossible. While Travis spent last offseason traveling the globe with girlfriend Taylor Swift on her Eras Tour, he’s now locking in on football and prepping for another Super Bowl run.During the final pre-hiatus episode, the Kelce brothers fielded a fan question about getting partners to do chores. Jason openly admitted that wife Kylie Kelce has to push him. “I am pro-nagging. I think nagging is a great thing to do,” he declared, joking that unless she tells him directly, it won’t happen. He added, “Tell me to get my lazy ass up and take the damn trash out.”Travis, listening in amusement, chimed in with a hilarious suggestion for Kylie: “Get a whistle.” Jason agreed. “I like coaching. I’ve been coached my whole life. I want people to tell me. I need that.”Adding fuel to the entertainment, former Chiefs first-round pick Eric Fisher cheekily asked what everyone was thinking. In a comment on the podcast’s Instagram clip, Fisher wrote, “Trav, is Tay asking you to do chores??”Travis kept it short and hilarious with a double “😂😂😂.” The comment gained nearly 2,800 likes, sparking buzz among Swifties and NFL fans alike.Beyond the laughs, Kelce proved his devotion off the field too. When Taylor Swift’s father, Scott Swift, recently underwent quintuple bypass surgery, Travis reportedly “went into total caregiver mode.” A source told Daily Mail, “This was their first crisis together, and Travis was doing everything right… If Taylor wasn’t ready to marry him before, she sure is now.”Their bond, once the subject of celebrity intrigue, now appears to be built on something much deeper.Also Read: Taylor Swift breaks real estate record with $12.3M sale as she and Travis Kelce build luxury empire No, Travis Kelce didn’t answer directly—he just responded with laughing emojis when asked.Former Chiefs teammate Eric Fisher posed the cheeky question on Instagram.Travis Kelce’s playful reaction sparked fan speculation but revealed little, keeping things private and humorous.","Former Chiefs teammate Eric Fisher posed the cheeky question on Instagram.

Is the NFLPA hiding something? JC Tretter's resignation sparks more questions than answers



NFLPA overhaul begins with JC Tretter’s exit: But is it reform or just political damage control?



FAQs



1. Why did JC Tretter resign from the NFLPA?

2. Was JC Tretter involved in the confidential collusion ruling?

3. Who are the top candidates to replace the

NFLPA executive director

?

Amid an explosive week for the NFL Players Association, former president and current chief strategy officer JC Tretter has stepped away from the organization, confirming he will not pursue the vacant executive director position. His decision, confirmed to CBS Sports, comes just days after Lloyd Howell’s resignation from the NFLPA and in the shadow of a controversial grievance ruling that the union reportedly withheld from public scrutiny. With tensions at a boiling point, Tretter has decided that family, not football politics, will take precedence.JC Tretter’s departure coincides with growing scrutiny surrounding a 61-page ruling from a collusion grievance filed by NFL players against team owners. Though the arbitrator ruled in favor of the league, leaked text messages between NFL owners—specifically the Chargers' Dean Spanos and Cardinals' Michael Bidwill—revealed pointed criticism about the Browns’ fully guaranteed deal with Deshaun Watson. Despite the significance of this potential collusion, the NFLPA chose to keep the ruling private.""Over the last couple days, it has gotten very, very hard for my family.And that's something I can't deal with,"" Tretter told CBS Sports' Jonathan Jones. ""So, the short bullet points are: I have no interest in being [executive director]. I have no interest in being considered; I've let the executive committee know that. I'm also going to leave the NFLPA in the coming days because I don't have anything left to give the organization.""I want to get my story out there, and I don't want it to look like this was sour grapes or I didn't get the job and I wanted the job. All I want to do is tell my story and then go be with my family.""This secrecy, according to Meadowlark Media’s Pablo Torre, was in part to shield Tretter himself, whose own messages criticizing Russell Wilson for failing to secure a fully guaranteed deal with Denver were included in the evidence. In addressing this, Tretter admitted, “So, the day the news broke, I sent an angry text to De [Smith] calling him a ‘f---ing loser.’ I did that.” He clarified that the message came before collusion allegations arose and added, “If he was colluded against, I would not have said that. ”Tretter maintained that he had no involvement in the confidential agreement between the NFLPA and the league that suppressed the collusion ruling. Yet, this swirl of controversy, combined with public backlash and private pressures, led to his resignation.Beyond the legal chaos, Tretter’s name also surfaced in Pablo Torre’s reporting as having played a key role in Howell’s elevation to executive director. Torre alleged Howell was a “handpicked” successor, rewarded with a newly created chief strategy officer role post-retirement. Tretter strongly refuted this narrative: “So the idea that I was jamming anybody through was false.” He revealed that in the internal straw poll between Howell and David White, Howell lost 10–1, with Tretter siding with the majority.Further heat surrounded Tretter from a podcast comment he described as a regrettable joke, where he seemed to suggest players could fake injuries to gain contract leverage—remarks that led to a separate grievance by the league. Tretter later called it “a dumb tongue-in-cheek remark that I shouldn't have said.”But the breaking point for Tretter came not from allegations or politics, but from personal toll. “Over the last couple days, it has gotten very, very hard for my family. And that's something I can't deal with,” he shared, expressing a desire to leave with his story told—not as a man bitter about a lost opportunity, but one stepping aside with dignity.“I’m not resigning because what I’ve been accused of is true. ... I’m resigning because this has gone too far for me and my family,” he said.Now, with both Howell and Tretter gone, the NFLPA is in urgent need of stability. Don Davis, the NFLPA’s chief player officer, appears to be the frontrunner for the interim executive director position, with Zamir Cobb and Ned Ehrlich also in consideration. The board of player reps is set to meet and discuss not only interim leadership but also how the next permanent head will be chosen.In a time marked by secrecy and scandal, Tretter’s candid resignation could become a rare moment of transparency in a union under fire.JC Tretter resigned citing immense personal and family stress from recent controversies surrounding the union and denied any misconduct.Tretter denied having access to the collusion grievance details or participating in the confidentiality agreement between the NFLPA and NFL.Don Davis, Zamir Cobb, and Ned Ehrlich are among the names being considered for the interim executive director role.Also Read: ""The NFLPA needs a dawg that...""

3. What did Camille Kostek reveal about Gisele Bündchen’s role in the Patriots’ inner circle?

In a rare, brutally honest reflection, Rob Gronkowski’s girlfriend Camille Kostek has exposed the hidden pressures and silent judgment she endured as part of the New England Patriots’ WAG (wives and girlfriends) circle—offering a glimpse into the exclusive, often toxic world behind the Super Bowl dynasty’s polished image.“I don’t want to be in a room where people talk behind your back,” Camille Kostek admitted in a recent interview, referencing her discomfort navigating the Foxborough social scene. While fans celebrated victories, she says she was battling subtle but relentless scrutiny—especially for not having a ring from Rob Gronkowski and for pursuing her own thriving modeling career.For Kostek, the unspoken hierarchy within the Patriots’ social sphere became painfully clear. “It was almost like if you’re not at every single foundation or charitable event, you don’t belong.” She often felt isolated and unwelcomed, even while sitting in Bill Belichick’s suite alongside Linda Holliday. “It wasn’t like anyone said, ‘You can’t sit with us.’ It just felt that way,” she said.It wasn’t until Gronk signed with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers that Camille says she finally felt embraced. “The Bucs wives just embraced me from the first moment.I felt seen,” she shared, contrasting the warmth in Tampa with the aloofness she endured in New England.Perhaps most revealing was her mention of Gisele Bündchen. “Gisele did her own thing,” she said, explaining how the supermodel’s global career and family life placed her on the periphery of the Patriots’ inner circle. “I never knew where she was… but when we did talk, it was like we’d known each other forever.”Kostek’s comments pull back the curtain on the subtle power dynamics and image-driven politics NFL partners face. While rings and appearances seem to rule, her story—and Gisele’s quiet independence—suggests that real strength may lie in walking your own path, no matter the whispers behind closed doors.Also Read: Josh Allen and Hailee Steinfeld hint at family expansion while embracing new roles off the field Camille Kostek revealed she felt judged and unwelcome among the Patriots' WAGs due to her career focus and not being engaged to Rob Gronkowski.Kostek said the Buccaneers’ wives embraced her immediately and made her feel genuinely seen and accepted.She shared that Gisele kept her distance due to her global commitments but was always warm and kind in their limited interactions.","Rob Gronkowski’s girlfriend Camille Kostek revealed the pressures she faced within the New England Patriots' WAG circle. “It was almost like if you’re not at every single foundation or charitable event, you don’t belong,” she said.

2. Is Tom Brady part-owner of any NFL team?

3. What businesses is Tom Brady involved in after retirement?

Tom Brady may have walked away with seven Super Bowl rings and a GOAT status, but not without a cost. In a candid and surprising revelation, Brady recently admitted that the physical punishment he endured during his two-decade NFL career—especially from one player—still haunts him. During a light-hearted moment in his YouTube series, Brady shared that his shoulder pain today traces back to a hit from Hall of Famer Ray Lewis in the 2009 AFC Wild Card game.Tom Brady’s comment, “That guy is still responsible for the shoulder pain I have,” might have been said with a smile, but the reality behind it is no joke. The 2009 AFC Wild Card game between the Patriots and the Ravens saw Lewis and Ed Reed deliver two brutal early sacks to Brady. It was one of the few times the Ravens came out on top against him—and it left a lasting impression.According to Brady, the intensity and brutality of defenders like Lewis altered the way he approached football from that point forward. “When you’re getting hit, there’s a discipline with your physical body that you need to take into account,” Brady admitted. “Because if you f**k around, you’re gonna get hurt. You don’t mess around with your training, because you will pay the price.”His respect for Ray Lewis was made clear when he revealed that Lewis topped the list of players he feared getting hit by the most. The pain wasn’t just physical—it shaped his mindset, recovery habits, and how he prepared himself to take the field, season after season.Despite that physical toll, Brady’s NFL career spanned an unmatched 23 seasons. His longevity wasn't just about avoiding hits; it was about building a body capable of surviving them. While his clean diet and strict lifestyle helped, it’s clear that fear of defenders like Lewis and Aaron Donald played a pivotal role in keeping him motivated in both the gym and the film room.Since retiring, Brady’s momentum hasn’t slowed. He’s now a lead football analyst at Fox Sports, co-owner of the Las Vegas Raiders, a stakeholder in CardVault, and the proud owner of his E1 Series electric boat racing team, Team Brady.Brady's reflections remind fans that even legends carry battle scars.

As speculation mounted regarding’s potential buyout from the Phoenix Suns, thequickly emerged as a serious contender to land the three-time All-Star guard. With Stephen Curry , Draymond Green, and recently acquired Jimmy Butler pushing for one last title run, Beal’s availability piqued widespread interest around the league. Bradley Beal ’s addition would have significantly boosted Golden State ’s scoring arsenal. A proven 20+ PPG scorer throughout his career, Beal shot an impressive 40.7% from three with the Suns in 2024–25, making him an ideal fit in the Golden State Warriors’ ball-movement-heavy offense.

Evgeni Malkin’s Penguins future in jeopardy amid rebuild talks



Is it a respectful rebuild or a difficult decision?



FAQs



1. Is Evgeni Malkin leaving the Pittsburgh Penguins?

2. When does Evgeni Malkin’s contract with the Penguins end?

3. Why might the Penguins consider trading Malkin?

As the Pittsburgh Penguins embrace a full-scale rebuild, questions are swirling around the future of their core legends. While Sidney Crosby remains the franchise centerpiece, other veteran stars — including longtime teammate Evgeni Malkin — may not be guaranteed the same loyalty. With Malkin’s name subtly resurfacing in trade discussions, the winds of change in Pittsburgh are beginning to stir louder than ever.A recent report by insider Chris Johnston has cast a shadow over Malkin’s tenure with the Penguins. Though the Russian forward has a contract that technically extends through the 2025–26 season, there are hints that Pittsburgh may be open to parting ways much sooner — but only under one condition.“It would only be if Malkin wants to go,” Johnston stated, highlighting the organization’s delicate approach. “What’s interesting about Malkin is that he’s on an expiring deal. This could be his last NHL season. I know that there’s been some discussion with the Penguins and Malkin’s camp about if he wants to play another year. We’ll see where that lands.”That hesitance doesn’t just come from loyalty — it’s tied to legacy.Malkin, a three-time Stanley Cup champion and one of the most iconic figures in franchise history, has stood beside Crosby through every high and low for nearly two decades. Any trade would not only shake the locker room but risk upsetting a fanbase deeply connected to No. 71.Still, the reality remains: the Penguins are eager for a fresh start. The presence of aging veterans could hinder their rebuild timeline. Johnston didn’t shy away from acknowledging that.“This is not a mystery. I think the Penguins would like to cut ties if there was a neat and tidy way to do it. There’s just no neat and tidy way to do it. I do believe they would like to start fresh, but, also honoring these guys. Respecting what they’ve done for the Penguins.”As the offseason unfolds, all eyes will remain on Malkin. Whether he chooses to stay for one final push or opts to make an emotional exit, the next move could define the end of an era in Pittsburgh.Malkin’s future remains uncertain, as the Penguins are open to moving him if he chooses to leave.His current deal runs through the end of the 2025–2026 NHL season.The team is undergoing a rebuild and may seek a fresh start while still honoring Malkin’s legacy.Also Read: The untold story behind Mitch Marner’s Vegas move: Report reveals when things began to break between the star and franchise",Evgeni Malkin’s contract with the Pittsburgh Penguins expires at the end of the 2025–2026 NHL season.

Bradley Beal’s Silent Farewell Goes Viral

Two Years of Missed Opportunities

Moving On: Clippers, Cap Space, and a Clean Slate

Why the NBA Couldn’t Stop Laughing

Closing Thoughts: A Superteam That Never Was

Whenjoined the Phoenix Suns in 2023, expectations soared. Fans and analysts imagined a Western Conference powerhouse built around Beal, Kevin Durant , and Devin Booker. But two years later, following a string of injuries and unmet expectations, Beal’s silent departure from Phoenix—with nothing more than a peace sign emoji on Instagram—set off a storm of amused and bewildered reactions across the NBA landscape.No farewell statement. No highlights. Just a single “✌️” emoji. That was the extent of Bradley Beal’s goodbye to the Suns, and it was enough to send social media into a frenzy. The NBA community, especially his fellow players, responded with a mix of laughter, sarcasm, and understanding:- Kevin Durant, now with the Houston Rockets, replied with a simple “😂”.- Bam Adebayo followed suit with the same laughing emoji.- Trae Young joked: “Not the deuces ✌️😂”- Tyus Jones added: “Aye man 🤣🤣”- Andre Drummond summed up the sentiment with: “Lmaooo your sick”The minimalism struck a chord—one emoji carried more weight than any formal statement. Bradley Beal ’s time in Phoenix never lived up to the hype. Hampered by injuries, he averaged just over 50 games per season. Despite the combined star power of Beal, Durant, and Booker, the Suns failed to win a single playoff game during Beal’s tenure.Their 2025 campaign ended in a first-round sweep, followed by an outright playoff miss.Statistically, Bradley Beal produced solid numbers—around 17 points per game on efficient shooting—but critics argued his performances lacked meaningful impact. The much-hyped trio couldn’t generate consistent offense together, and the chemistry never materialized on the court.Following a mutual buyout, Beal is now set to join the Los Angeles Clippers , giving him a fresh opportunity to reestablish himself in a new system. He also reportedly gave up $14 million in the process. Meanwhile, Phoenix clears significant salary cap space and pivots toward building around Devin Booker.Yet, for many, it’s not Beal’s next step that’s memorable—it’s how he exited. That single emoji symbolized the disbanding of what was once envisioned as the NBA’s next great superteam.The responses from Durant, Adebayo, and others weren’t just jokes—they reflected the deeper culture of the league:- A sense of fraternity: NBA players often poke fun at one another in ways only insiders understand.- Shared frustration: Many stars, including Durant, had experienced the same disappointing ride in Phoenix.- An unspoken message: Beal’s peace sign may have said more than words could—about the chaos, the exit, and maybe even relief.Bradley Beal’s exit from Phoenix won’t be remembered for a teary tribute or a media circus. It will be remembered for its quiet finality and the wave of reactions it triggered. His time in the desert will likely go down as one of the NBA’s biggest “what-ifs”—but at least, in true NBA fashion, it left the league entertained.Also read: Joel Embiid Addresses Leadership Criticism in the Highly Demanding NBA League: ""You Can’t Expect Me to Be Part of That Again"" Now headed to the Clippers, Bradley Beal turns the page.

India camp hit by more injuries, Playing XI TENSION before Manchester Test vs England

Boost for Afghanistan women’s team

USA Cricket put on notice

In a blow to the BCCI ’s aspirations of holding the ‘Ultimate Test,’ the International Cricket Council (ICC) on Sunday confirmed that England will host the finals of the next three editions of the World Test Championship in 2027, 2029 and 2031. The ICC made the decision at its Annual Conference in Singapore this weekend.Right since the inaugural edition of World Test Championship in 201921, England have been the sole hosts. Southampton hosted the first WTC final between India and New Zealand in 2021, while India and Australia contested the second WTC final at The Oval in London in 2023. In 2025, the ‘Home of Cricket’ Lord’s Cricket ground hosted the third WTC final, between Australia and South Africa.“The Board also confirmed the awarding of hosting rights for the ICC World Test Championship Finals for the 2027, 2029, and 2031 editions to the England and Wales Cricket Board, following a successful track record in hosting recent finals,” the ICC said in a media statement on Sunday.According to reliable sources, the BCCI was highly interested in bringing the event to its shores, but that possibility has been dealt a blow for the next six years.In another significant development, the ICC has decided that the Afghanistan’s displaced women’s cricket team, whose most members are currently residing in Australia, will be involved in some way in the next two women’s World Cups—the 2025 ODI World Cup in India and the 2026 T20 World Cup in England next June. The qualification process for the 2025 Women’s ODI World Cup is already complete. At the moment, there’s no clarity in which way Afghanistan’s women’s team will be involved. Notably, the initiative to help Afghanistan’s women cricketers find their feet again is being led by the BCCI, England & Wales Cricket Board and Cricket Australia—the three most powerful boards in world cricket, with ICC deputy chairman Imran Khwaja supervising it.The ICC has also given a three-month notice to USA Cricket to set its house in order, failing which the global governing body of the game will take action against it. “The ICC reiterated its previous position and confirmed that the organisation remains on notice. USA Cricket is required to undertake comprehensive governance reforms, including but not limited to completing free and fair elections within a three-month period,” stated the ICC.In other developments, the Timor Leste Cricket Federation and the Zambia Cricket Union have been granted Associate Member status. Three new officials from Associate nations have been elected to the ICC Chief Executives Committee Gurumurthy Palani from France, Anuraag Bhatnagar from Cricket Hong Kong and Gurdeep Klair from Cricket Canada.","England will host the finals of the next three editions of the World Test Championship in 2027, 2029 and 2031.

Rishabh Pant battled pain, worked hard in nets on Day 2 to bat at Lord's | Exclusive Nets Visuals

After the Youth Test between India U-19 and England U-19 ended at Kent County ground in Beckenham last week, the curator was asked if the Indian Test team requested any special kind of pitches for their practice session scheduled two days later. “It’s been a long summer and a lot of cricket has been played. Even if they ask for anything, I won’t be able to give them,” the curator said while dust came off as he was brushing the centre square.The locals here call it a beautiful summer. The past two gloomy and rainy days aside, the sun has been blazing down.The weather is not the only talking point this summer here. The high-scoring games and consistently flat nature of pitches are a departure from how cricket is usually played here. India pacer Akash Deep, on his first tour of England, imagined prodigious seam and swing. That bubble burst in the first India ‘A’ game he played before the Test series.Before the series started, England team’s managing director Rob Key pointed out that the increasing amount of cricket has played a part in the pitches getting flatter over the years. “There are a lot of tired squares. They’ve got more cricket than ever now that The Hundred and women’s cricket are in every county,” Key analysed.As the series went on till the third Test at Lord’s, the pitches lost a fair amount of zip. At Edgbaston, England captain Ben Stokes even said that the conditions resembled the subcontinent. Former England captain Andrew Strauss, too, leaned on the narrative. “With cloud cover and a bit more moisture in the surfaces, you’re going to get a little bit more live grass. Therefore, it’s going to seam and swing a bit more. So, the weather’s played perfectly into India’s hands so far ,” Strauss told TOI during the Lord’s Test.A batting-dominated approach of the Bazball era may have had a role to play too. Another former England captain Michael Vaughan brought up this point during a chat with TOI.“For England to play this style of cricket (attacking batting), if you play on green tops, they are going to get bowled out quite quickly. I would think that England want to play on flatter wickets to play the expansive brand of cricket,” Vaughan reckoned.Former India wicketkeeper Deep Dasgupta, who has been a broadcaster here, pointed out that the groundstaff struggle to maintain moisture after all the grounds were made sand-based to improve drainage. “A few of the ground staff told me that all the rainwater drains out so quickly that it dries up the surface quickly. In fact, the groundstaff in Birmingham had to recently put cardboard sheets besides the main square so that the main square remains moist longer,” Dasgupta told TOI .","High-scoring games and consistently flat nature of pitches are a departure from how cricket is usually played here.

Poll Who do you think should replace Nitish Kumar Reddy if ruled out due to injury? Shardul Thakur Dhruv Jurel Another allrounder Stick with the current squad

On Saturday, Anshul Kamboj was asked to travel to Manchester as a cover for pacers Arshdeep Singh and Akash Deep. Just as the Indian team was settling into a good rhythm with a settled combination in the series, they were hamstrung by a few injuries leading up to the fourth Test starting here on Wednesday. The latest on the list is Nitish Kumar Reddy, who is suspected to have suffered a knee injury.It’s been raining here almost all day for the last two days. The practice session on Sunday was restricted to the indoor facilities at Old Trafford. Shubman Gill, Rishabh Pant, Jasprit Bumrah, KL Rahul, Washington Sundar, and Reddy skipped practice. Akash Deep’s groin and back are being monitored closely, while Arshdeep’s split webbing on his bowling hand is likely to take some more time to heal. TOI understands that Reddy could well be ruled out of the tour. “Reddy has injured his knee. The BCCI medical team is assessing him, but it could be a ligament tear,” a BCCI source told TOI. If Reddy is unfit, the team management may have to go with Shardul Thakur.India had banked on the utility allrounders in Nitish Kumar Reddy and Washington to lend balance to the playing XI from the second Test. With two Tests remaining, they were expected to play a bigger role than just being the support wheels.It’s not just Reddy and Washington; Dhruv Jurel may have to be ready too, as Pant’s recovery from an index finger injury is also being monitored daily. Assistant Coach Ryan ten Doeschate on Thursday claimed Jurel is being kept ready in case Pant doesn’t recover enough to keep wickets here.“It’s giving as much attention and care to the guys who aren’t playing as they are playing. Making sure they get quality practice between tests. Talking to them about why we are going with the combinations we’re not going with and hoping that they’re in the right frame of mind and obviously physically and technically ready to play Test cricket when their chance comes,” ten Doeschate said on Thursday.Gautam Gambhir’s tenure as Head Coach of the team has mostly been about having more players with multiple skills regardless of the format of the game. That led to Washington Sundar playing ahead of R Ashwin to start the Test series in Australia last November. Reddy was fast-tracked into the Test team in Australia mainly because of the promise he showed in the preceding IPL. Reddy’s century in the Boxing Day Test in Melbourne raised hopes of finally discovering a genuine seam-bowling allrounder in the mix since Hardik Pandya expressed reluctance to play Test cricket due to fitness issues a few years ago. Thakur, who was seen as the one to be doing the job in the interim, lost his place to Reddy after the first Test here. It’s time Thakur proved the selectors right for bringing him back almost out of the blue.There are murmurs that Gambhir has been overtly keen to give Jurel more game time too. All of it sounds fair in the white-ball formats. To execute it in the longest format of the game needs absolute conviction.Gambhir’s calls have been mostly vindicated by Washington and Reddy with crucial contributions at different stages in different Test matches. Washington’s spell of 4/22 in the second innings at Lord’s last week gave India a definite advantage to go ahead in the series. He also answered the team management’s call to arrest any lower middle-order collapse in the first innings before he fell for a duck in the chase at Lord’s.It was Washington’s finest performance overseas.However, Reddy’s performances since the MCG Test have been underwhelming. He was brought in to bat at No. 6 from Edgbaston. By the second innings in the second Test, he lost that batting number to Ravindra Jadeja. The three top-order wickets at Lord’s have been his biggest contribution. Thakur looked out of breath in the first Test.What this team needs at this moment is reassurance from Thakur and Washington that they are ready to step up and do more than just contribute to the team.Washington and Thakur are not completely alien to taking more responsibility when the team is somewhat crippled, as he showed on his Test debut in the famous Gabba win in 2021. It was in England in 2021 that Thakur truly showed his prowess as a bowling allrounder with his batting capabilities down the order. He may have got another shot at redemption.","Anshul Kamboj was asked to travel to Manchester as a cover for pacers Arshdeep Singh and Akash Deep.

Netflix Quietly Regrets Meghan Markle’s $100M Deal





Natasha Archer has been by the Princess of Wales’s side since 2010. She selected outfits for overseas tours, was even on hand at the hospital for royal baby photo calls, ready with spare outfits and supplies and was promoted to Senior Private Executive Assistant in 2022. Last week Kensington Palace confirmed Archer, now 37, is leaving to start a private “luxury consultancy.”Soon after the news broke, Archer switched her long-private Instagram profile to public. Royal watchers noticed two quick moves. She stopped following Meghan Markle , the Duchess’s lifestyle label As Ever, and several friends in Meghan’s circle, including makeup artist Daniel Martin and polo player Delfina Blaquier.The timing set off fresh speculation because the royal family is quietly trying to ease tensions with the Sussexes. Palace sources say aides for King Charles and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex held an informal meeting in London this month to explore next steps toward better relations. Prince William’s team did not attend, leaving doubts about how far any thaw can go.Commentators see Archer’s “unfollow” spree as a public hint that fences remain unmended. The Blast, citing insider chatter, called the move a “controversial stunt” that risks undercutting reconciliation plans said to be backed by Princess Kate herself.People who have worked with Archer stress her loyalty to the Wales household. She received the Royal Victorian Order in 2019 for personal service and is married to royal photographer Chris Jackson. Friends say her new consultancy will advise private clients on travel logistics and event styling, skills honed during fifteen years on royal duty.Neither Kensington Palace nor the Sussex office has commented on the social-media changes. Online, opinions split quickly. Some see the unfollows as a harmless reset before Archer’s career move. Others view them as a subtle show of support for Kate during a sensitive phase in family diplomacy.What happens next will likely unfold off camera. Kate is said to be focused on her children’s summer break and on a fuller return to public engagements later in the year. Meghan remains in California, preparing for new launches under her As Ever brand.

which criminalized sexual acts between men, Editor's note





In 1476, a young Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519) was investigated by the Florentine moral authorities. Someone had anonymously accused him of fornicating with a 17-year-old sex worker. But the charges were dropped because of a lack of evidence.German literary historian Dino Heicker, the author of a book about the history of queerness,"" says there are contemporary sources that prove Leonardo loved men and was particularly taken with an apprentice 28 years younger than him named Gian Giacomo Caprotti, whom he nicknamed Salai (""little devil""). They lived together for many years.A few years ago, Italian art historians thought they had found proof that the world-famous Mona Lisa was not a depiction of Lisa del Giocondo, the wife of a Florentine merchant, but of Caprotti instead. He modeled for da Vinci several times and researchers say that the resemblance is unmistakable. Additionally, the letters L and S (for Leonardo and Salai) can even be seen in the eyes of the Mona Lisa, as well as the endearing words, ""mon salai,"" which could also be an anagram of ""Mona Lisa. ""But the Louvre Museum, where the world-famous painting hangs, isn't convinced of the theory? Da Vinci and his companion took their secrets to their graves.In 1550, Leonardo's first biographer, Giorgio Vasari, wrote that the painter took ""peculiar pleasure"" in the beautiful boy, the word ""peculiar"" functioning as a euphemism for da Vinci's queerness.""When a majority defines what is normal and abnormal and declares a binary gender model to be the norm, this creates a difficult environment for minorities who feel differently,"" Heiker says.In his book, he lists some of the draconian punishments that were inflicted upon queer, non-binary or transgender people in the past. They were accused of indulging in what was referred to at the time as an ""unnatural"" lifestyle and at times put in chains, stoned, castrated or even burned at the stake. Those meting the punishment sometimes used the Bible to legitimize their persecution of queer people, especially the biblical story of Sodom and Gomorrah — these cities were destroyed by God because of ""sinful"" behavior. The term ""sodomy"" has also been used as a synonym for homosexuality.This story ""provided the blueprint for centuries of stigmatization toward other kinds of people."" In 1512, the Spanish conquistador Vasco Nunez de Balboa ordered his dogs to maul Indigenous people in America, accusing them of having committed ""the horrible sin of sodomy.""On the other hand, there were also societies in which many forms of queerness were generally accepted. For example, during antiquity, it was common for men to have a male lover in addition to wives. The Roman emperor Hadrian was so heartbroken by the death of his beloved Antinous that he had him posthumously declared as a god, and erected numerous statues and places of worship to honor the beautiful youth.The Greek philosopher Aristotle (384-322 BC) said that lawmakers on the island of Crete had come up with something very special to celebrate new births: pederasty, or ""boy love,"" when an older man took a young man into his home to train him sexually. ""Sexual favors were expected from the younger man, but this was not viewed disparagingly by society,"" explains Dino Heicker.Love between women was also commonplace. On the island of Lesbos, the poet Sappho paid homage to the beauty of the female form in her verses. And models for a variety of different kinds of love were found in the world of the gods — especially Zeus, the father of the gods, and the epitome of queerness. This term did not exist at the time, but he transformed himself into women, animals, and even a cloud in order to have sex with the object of his desire.In ancient times, there was nothing considered wrong with men having sex with other men or boys, ""as long as they played the active role,"" says Heicker. ""The penetrated man, i.e. the inferior man, was considered effeminate and was considered socially inferior."" In the Roman Empire, people liked to accuse their political opponents of being sexually passive, because ""it was a way of tarnishing their honor.""The spread of Christianity brought an end to the leniency towards same-sex love. The bishop and Benedictine monk, Petrus Damiani (1006-1072) was one of the most influential clergymen of the 11th century. He railed against fornication, which he saw spreading even in monasteries: ""The befouling cancer of sodomy,"" he wrote, ""is, in fact, spreading so through the clergy or rather, like a savage beast, is raging with such shameless abandon through the flock of Christ. "" Sodomy, he was convinced, was the result of diabolical whispers.Among the samurai warriors in Japan and at the Chinese imperial court, there was a more relaxed attitude towards queerness; same-sex love was common among men. In 1549, the Jesuit priest Francisco de Xavier noted: ""The Buddhist priests constantly commit crimes against nature and do not even deny it. They openly admit it.""In later centuries and modern times, various LGBTQ+ figures — including among royalty — achieved fame.Heicker's book lists the Russian composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky (1840-1893), the Irish writer and playwright Oscar Wilde (1854-1900), the US writer James Baldwin (1924-1987) and also Eleanor Butler and Sarah Ponsonby, two Irish women who retreated to a remote valley in Wales around 1780 and who were eyed suspiciously as the ""Ladies of Llangollen."" They were all just trying to find happiness in their own way.The English landowner Anne Lister (1791-1840) left behind a set of diaries that was added to the UNESCO Memory of the World Register in 2011. ""In these 26 volumes, she writes in detail about lesbian sex and her relationship with women,"" explains Heicker. Lister developed a secret code so that no uninitiated person could read her confessions, which were not deciphered until 1930. In her village, she was often referred to as ""Gentleman Jack"" but was largely left undisturbed. Lister's writing had a significant influence on the direction of British gender studies and stories about women.From the Mahu on Tahiti to the Muxes of the Zapotec people in Mexico, the Hijras in South Asia and the Lhamanas of the Zuni culture in north America: for thousands of years, across cultures, people have felt they belonged to the third gender, identifying neither as men nor as women. ""There was much greater diversity than the narrow, binary gender model would have us think today,"" says Heicker. ""The Zuni, for example, do not assume that gender is innate, rather they see it as a social construct. ""In Germany today, the third gender is referred to as ""diverse.""""Queer people, especially in Germany, have had to fight for freedoms previous generations could only dream of,"" says Heicker. ""In 1994, Paragraph 175() was finally removed from the penal code. Same-sex marriage has been legalized, and sexual discrimination is now an offence. On the other hand, and here comes the big but: these achievements must continuously also be protected, especially in the face of attempts to turn back the clock.""","In ancient times, there was nothing wrong with men having sex with other men or boys. In 1512, the Spanish conquistador Vasco Nunez de Balboa ordered his dogs to maul Indigenous people in America, accusing them of having committed ""the horrible sin of sodomy"" In the Roman Empire, people liked to accuse their political opponents of being sexually passive.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122794164,imgsize-1566208,width-400,resizemode-4/122794164.jpg"

is rooted in presence, not performance. Each meeting, whether with students or workers, shows consistency, humility, and care.

1. Top Students Met a President And Felt Like They Met a Father

2. A Hug at a Sports Festival Not Just for the Cameras

3. No Guards, No Motorcade, Just a Walk in the City

4. At a Power Plant, a Quiet Thank You to Workers



5. Recognizing Foster Mothers for What Truly Counts



FAQs

Q1. Why does Sheikh Mohamed keep making these personal visits?

Q2. Are these visits planned for publicity?

Q3. What do people feel after meeting him?





Some leaders lead from a distance. Others choose to stay close. Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the President of the UAE, is clearly the second kind. His schedule is full, meetings, official visits, national responsibilities, but somehow, he keeps making space for people. Not in grand ceremonies, but in small, real ways. He’s seen walking the streets of Abu Dhabi without bodyguards. Hugging athletes at local events. Sitting with nuclear plant workers. Or quietly thanking foster mothers for doing what matters most.None of this is by accident. It’s a pattern. One that’s become central to how he leads. Presence, humility, and human connection are not occasional, they’re consistent. And over time, this steady, quiet approach has reshaped how people across the UAE view their leadership: not as distant authority, but as someone who listens and never forgets who he’s leading.Here are just a few moments that show why Sheikh Mohamed is often called the people’s leader, quiet, consistent, and deeply committed to the nation and its people.Just hours after final exam results were announced, a group of top students in the UAE found themselves in a room with Sheikh Mohamed. But it didn’t feel like a formal event. It felt personal. The student felt like they were meeting a father, not a head of stateThere were no long speeches.He didn’t just shake hands and leave. He took time to listen. To talk to them like someone who understands how hard they worked. He made them feel proud, but also reminded them to stay grounded. The message was simple: your effort matters, and you matter.At the Abu Dhabi Summer Sports Festival, Sheikh Mohamed didn’t show up as a guest of honor. He showed up as a supporter. He walked through the event like anyone else, greeting athletes, coaches, and even visitors in the crowd. There were hugs, smiles, and quiet conversations.It didn’t feel planned or polished. That’s what made it real. He didn’t need to give a speech to show encouragement. Just showing up was enough and that’s what people remember. A leader who looks you in the eye, not from a stage, but from the sidelines.A video recently went viral online. In it, Sheikh Mohamed is walking down a street in Abu Dhabi, no security, no blocked roads, no special treatment. Just him, talking with a few people like any other resident.In most countries, this wouldn’t happen. Leaders are usually behind barriers, surrounded by layers of protocol. But here, it sends a different message. That trust goes both ways and that safety isn’t just about fences or guards. It’s about a sense of belonging. It’s about knowing your leader walks the same streets you do.When the UAE marked the completion of Unit 3 at the Barakah Nuclear Power Plant, most expected the usual formalities. But the most meaningful moment wasn’t part of the ceremony. It was a quick, unscripted chat between Sheikh Mohamed and a small group of workers.They were standing casually, in a loose circle. Talking, laughing, thanking each other. No media glare, no big headlines. Just recognition, the kind that sticks. These workers are the backbone of major national projects, and Sheikh Mohamed made sure they knew he saw them, not just the results.There are many ways to lead. One of them is by showing gratitude to those doing quiet, important work. That’s what happened when Sheikh Mohamed met with a group of foster mothers caring for children without families.He didn’t rush through the meeting. He shook hands. He listened. He thanked each one for giving kids a stable, loving home. There was no ceremony, just sincerity. And for the mothers, that meant more than any award. It was a rare kind of leadership: one that honors care, compassion, and the invisible strength holding communities together.Because he believes real leadership happens on the ground. These aren’t just appearances, they’re a way of staying connected to the people and their everyday lives.Not really. Many of them aren’t announced ahead of time, and often go unnoticed until someone shares a moment online. They seem to come from a place of genuine intention, not public image.Most describe it as surprising and deeply moving. It makes them feel seen. And it reminds them that their leader isn’t far away, he’s right here with them.","Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan is often called the people’s leader, quiet, consistent, and deeply committed to the nation and its people.

Strategic Benefits and the Road Ahead









The Emirates Cricket Board (ECB) has earned a reputation for last-minute tournament hosting. In 2025, for example, the ICC shifted Champions Trophy group and knockout matches featuring India to Dubai due to diplomatic tensions. Similarly, the UAE picked up the 2024 Women’s T20 World Cup, relocating the entire event from Bangladesh amid unrest. ECB COO Subhan Ahmed confirmed their “unique selling point” is flexibility, citing a track record of rapidly delivering high-profile contests.The UAE operates multiple cricket-ready stadiums like Dubai International, Sheikh Zayed (Abu Dhabi), Sharjah—all ICC-compliant and equipped with modern amenities such as advanced lighting (“Ring of Fire”), state-of-the-art pitch management, and broadcast facilities. Significantly, the ICC relocated its global headquarters to Dubai in 2005, reinforcing confidence in the region as an administrative and logistical hub.Cricket thrives in the UAE largely due to its South Asian diaspora, constituting around 60–70% of the nation’s population . Matches of and between South Asian nations draw massive crowds. Women's T20 World Cup had a crowd of nearly 16,000 in women's group games and the Women’s T20 final attracted 21,457 spectators, a 68% increase on the prior edition.Fans describe the experience as electrifying, with chanting, dancing, and a shared cultural fervour.Sporting events now generate real economic impact. The ILT20 franchise league, launched in 2022, projected to attract global fans, boosting hotel, dining, and service-sector demand. Estimates suggest the 2025 Champions Trophy fixtures in Dubai may bring in USD 45 million through tickets, broadcasting rights, and sponsorships.The UAE’s neutrality enables crucial geopolitical hosting. Hosting high-profile Asia Cups, IPL editions during pandemic restrictions, and high-stakes T20 tournaments elevates the UAE's influence and global reputation.While the UAE hosts some of the world’s most prestigious cricket tournaments, its own national team has been steadily growing, albeit with less fanfare. The UAE men’s team, governed by the Emirates Cricket Board (ECB), is an Associate Member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) since 1990. It has qualified for multiple ICC tournaments, including the 1996, 2015 ODI World Cups and several T20 World Cups, most recently competing in the 2024 edition in USA and WI. The team is composed of a mix of Emirati-born players and expatriate talent primarily from South Asia, reflecting the country’s demographic makeup. While critics argue that homegrown Emirati representation remains limited, recent grassroots initiatives and partnerships with schools are aimed at developing local talent and reducing dependency on expatriate players. In the women’s circuit, the UAE team also qualified for the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup qualifiers, signalling growing participation at all levels. These efforts reflect the UAE’s broader vision not just to host cricket but to compete and succeed on the world stage.The UAE is not only a venue provider but also a cricket incubator. Grassroots programs, net-bowling coaching, and domestic tournaments support development. The ILT20 emerges as a flagship T20 league, enabling global and local player integration, while the national team fields local and expatriate-born talent raised in the UAE.The UAE maintains a balanced cricket schedule: IPL in 2020–21, men’s T20 World Cup in 2021, Asia Cups in 2018 & 2022, Women’s T20 World Cup in 2024, and Champions Trophy matches in 2025. This diversity enhances international visibility while testing operational resilience across formats and gender parity.Cricket benefits catalyze tourism, infrastructure investment, and global branding aligning with the UAE’s broader Vision 2030 objectives. Challenges remain: global competition from emerging cricket nations, transitioning from reactive hosting to establishing dedicated annual events, and integrating Emirati nationals into cricket pathways. Still, the UAE’s strong venue framework, diasporic backing, and neutrality keep it at the forefront of cricket strategy.The UAE’s commitment to cricket extends well beyond hosting, it’s a calculated, multi-layered strategy powered by strategic infrastructure, crowd attraction, soft power, and market economics. The Emirates Cricket Board’s ability to shift events on short notice, combined with sustained investment in local talent and inclusive programming, has cemented the UAE as a global cricket hub. As itinerant hosting evolves into institutional legacy, the UAE stands poised to redefine cricket in the 21st-century sports landscape.","The UAE has emerged as a premier global cricket hub, hosting marquee events like the IPL, Women’s T20 World Cup, Asia Cups, and Champions Trophy matches on short notice.

Vaibhav Suryavanshi, aged 14, has etched his name in cricket history by becoming the first player to score a half-century and take a wicket in the same Youth Test match before turning 15, during the ongoing series against England.Suryavanshi's remarkable achievement surpassed the previous record held by Bangladesh's Mehidy Hasan Miraz, who accomplished this feat at 15 years and 167 days against Sri Lanka in Mirpur in 2013. Former India cricketer Suresh Raina also achieved this milestone at 15 years and 242 days against England in Colombo in 2002.In the opening Youth Test, Suryavanshi displayed his all-round capabilities despite a modest start. He scored 14 runs in the first innings before being dismissed but made a strong comeback in the second innings with a quick-fire 56 runs off 44 deliveries. His left-arm spin bowling yielded two wickets in the first innings.The match saw India posting a substantial first-innings total of 540, with captain Ayush Mhatre scoring a century. Vihaan Malhotra, Abhigyan Kundu, Rahul Kumar, and RS Ambrish contributed with half-centuries.England's Alex Green and Ralphie Albert claimed three wickets each.England responded with 439 runs in their first innings, with Rocky Flintoff top-scoring at 93. India's Henil Patel picked up three wickets in the innings.In their second innings, India were bowled out for 248, with Malhotra leading the scoring with 63 runs. England's Archie Vaughan impressed with a six-wicket haul.Chasing 350 for victory, England managed to reach 270 for 7 when the match concluded in a draw. England's captain Hamza Shaikh scored a century during the chase.Suryavanshi's performance also saw him collect another distinction as the youngest player to score multiple half-centuries in international U-19 cricket in the Test format.The second Youth Test of the series is scheduled to begin on Sunday, July 20, at Chelmsford, where Suryavanshi will have another opportunity to showcase his talents.","Vaibhav Suryavanshi is the first player to score a half-century and take a wicket in the same Youth Test match before turning 15.

Fast bowlers Taskin Ahmed and Mustafizur Rahman starred with the ball as Bangladesh cruised to a seven-wicket win over Pakistan in the first T20I in Dhaka on Sunday. Chasing a modest 111, opener Parvez Hossain smashed an unbeaten 56 to seal victory in just 15.3 overs and give the hosts a 1-0 lead in the three-match series.Put into bat, Pakistan crumbled to their lowest T20I total against Bangladesh — 110 all out in 19.3 overs. Taskin returned figures of 3 for 22, while Mustafizur was miserly with 2 for 6 in four overs. Pakistan’s previous lowest against Bangladesh was 127/5 at the same venue in 2021.Despite an early double-strike from debutant pacer Salman Mirza (2/23), who dismissed Tanzid Hasan and Litton Das cheaply, Bangladesh recovered swiftly. Parvez and Towhid Hridoy (36) stitched together a crucial 73-run stand for the third wicket to ease the chase.Parvez was in fine form, hitting five sixes and three boundaries during his 39-ball knock, finishing unbeaten on 56.The win marked only Bangladesh's fourth victory over Pakistan in 23 T20Is.Earlier, Pakistan endured a nightmare start, losing half their side for just 46 by the eighth over. Saim Ayub (6), Mohammad Haris (4), captain Salman Agha (3), Hasan Nawaz (0), and Mohammad Nawaz (3) all fell cheaply. Fakhar Zaman top-scored with 44 off 34 balls, including six fours and a six. He was twice reprieved — on 4 and 30 — before being run out after a mix-up with Khushdil Shah. Shah (17) and Abbas Afridi (22) later added 33 runs for the seventh wicket to take Pakistan past the 100-run mark.Reflecting on the loss, skipper Salman Agha said: “It wasn’t enough on the board as we lost wickets at regular intervals, which we have to talk about before the second game.”Litton Das acknowledged the challenge of batting on a slow pitch: “It’s not an easy wicket to bat on, but the way we batted, it looked good. We took early wickets and that’s the key point.”The second and third T20Is will also be played in Dhaka, on Tuesday and Thursday, respectively.",Bangladesh beat Pakistan by seven wickets in first T20I in Dhaka. Parvez Hossain hits unbeaten 56 to give hosts a 1-0 lead in three-match series.

EXCLUSIVE: Nitish Kumar Reddy ruled out of England Test series

Former Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi has launched a scathing attack on Indian players for pulling out of the match a day before the World Championship of Legends (WCL) clash between the two countries.""We are here to play cricket, and I've always said that cricket should be kept away from politics — it should move forward. A player should be a good ambassador, not a source of embarrassment for their country,"" Afridi told reporters.The second edition of the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) tournament, which is co-owned by Bollywood star Ajay Devgn, started on June 18 at Edgbaston and is scheduled to conclude with the final on August 2.World Cup winner Yuvraj Singh is the captain of the India Champions, while the squad also features the likes of Dhawan, Harbhajan Singh, Yusuf Pathan, Irfan Pathan, Suresh Raina, Robin Uthappa, and Varun Aaron, among others.The Pakistan team has in its ranks captain Shahid Afridi, Younis Khan, Sohail Tanvir, Wahab Riaz, Kamran Akmal, among a host of yesteryear players.""We've come here to play cricket. If [India] didn’t want to play against Pakistan, they should’ve refused before coming here.But now you've arrived, even held practice sessions, and then suddenly changed everything in a single day,"" said Afridi.Former India opener Dhawan also shared a statement on X, announcing his stand not to participate in the match against Pakistan.""This is to formally reiterate and confirm that Mr. Shikhar Dhawan will not be participating in any matches against the Pakistan team in the upcoming WCL League. This decision was communicated earlier during our discussion on call and WhatsApp dated 11th May 2025,"" read his statement.Dhawan made it clear that he has taken the call in view of the current ""geopolitical"" situation between India and Pakistan in the aftermath of the Pahalgam terror attack and the ensuing Operation Sindoor carried out by the country.Afridi, without taking any names, lambasted one cricketer and called him a ""bad egg.""""Sports bring people closer, but if politics gets involved in everything, how will we move forward? Until we sit together and discuss issues, nothing will improve — lack of communication only makes things worse,"" he said.""We've come here to play cricket, to have one-on-one interactions and friendly conversations. But sometimes, there's one bad egg that spoils everything for everyone else.""""If I had known the match was being stopped because of me, I wouldn't have even gone to the ground. But cricket should go on. What is Shahid Afridi in front of cricket? Nothing,"" he said.""The game comes first. As a sport, cricket is the biggest thing. Bringing politics into it, or an Indian cricketer saying he won't play against Pakistan — then don't play, just sit out. But sport is bigger, cricket is bigger, and it's bigger than Shahid Afridi too,"" added Afridi.Off-spin legend Harbhajan, a sitting Rajya Sabha MP, Yusuf, who is also a Member of Parliament, and Irfan too have conveyed their decision to boycott the match against Pakistan, though they are yet to issue a statement in this regard.The players received a lot of flak on social media for agreeing to play against the Pakistan team.India had defeated Pakistan by five wickets to win the inaugural edition of the six-team legends tournament last year at Edgbaston.",Former Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi has launched a scathing attack on Indian players for pulling out of the match.

Experienced Grandmaster and world No. 5 Koneru Humpy made China’s 19-year-old Yuxin Song dance to her tunes to enter the semifinals of the FIDE Women’s Chess World Cup in Batumi, Georgia, on Sunday.Humpy split the point with young Song in 53 moves in the second game to clinch the quarterfinal contest 1.5-0.5 and set her semifinal date with an experienced Chinese GM and top seed, Lei Tingjie. The world No.3, Tingjie, ended the campaign of Georgia’s Nana Dzagnidze with a 2-0 triumph.Tingjie utilised her opening advantage with the white pieces to register a hard-fought 72-move victory and entered the semifinal in style by winning both her games in the classical format.The battle between Divya Deshmukh and D Harika, ended in an entertaining 60-move draw. The quarterfinal will now be decided in the tiebreaks to be played in the rapid and blitz formats with different time controls.Another India-China clash saw a marathon game where China’s world No.8 Tan Zhongyi ended Vaishali Rameshbabu’s campaign. In a marathon 88-move Semi-Slav defense, Vaishali failed to defend with her black pieces, losing the second game and bowing out of the quarterfinals 0.5-1.5.The contest between an experienced Indian GM and China’s young International Master (IM) saw a Queen's Pawn Opening game of Chigorin Variation, with Humpy defending an unusual position where Song lined up her pawns by the 19th move. Aiming to come out of that unusual position, Humpy brought her rook into the field and made a dubious move on the 32nd turn. The position protecting Song's citadel remained the same until the 35th turn when Humpy checked her Chinese opponent, and both exchanged their queens.Humpy then utilised the services of her attacking pawn while bringing her rook into a better position. With Humpy all set to become two pawns up, both players repeated their moves, and the game ended in a draw.Humpy said, “It feels happy to qualify for the semifinal without playing tiebreaks. I could have played better, but in time trouble, I slipped. I will utilise the rest day in preparing as my semifinal is going to be very tough. Being a top seed, she is one of the strongest opponents.”In the battle of compatriots, defending with her black pieces against an experienced Harika was always a tough task for Divya. The 19-year-old came under severe time trouble, and despite an advancing pawn in an equal position with both having a rook and three pawns at the 42nd turn, Divya had to take more time to bail herself out. She did that by bringing her king to the centre, and both were left with a rook and two pawns in the endgame.Though Divya became a pawn up on the 52nd turn, she was severely low on time, and Harika had placed her king in a better position. Within the next eight moves, both Divya and Harika signed the peace treaty to head into the tiebreaks for a place in the semifinals.India No. 3 and 15th ranked Vaishali suffered a heartbreaking defeat against China No. 4, Tan. For the second successive day, Vaishali and Tan played out a lengthy game and were the last to finish their contest.","World No. 5 Koneru Humpy beat China’s 19-year-old Yuxin Song 1.5-0.5.

Former India off-spinner Harbhajan Singh revealed an emotional conversation with the daughter of his former teammate S Sreesanth Harbhajan opened up about how he was left shattered after she told him that she didn't want to talk to him because he had hit her father during the 2008 edition of the IPL. Harbhajan, playing for Mumbai Indians , had slapped Kings XI Punjab’s (now Punjab Kings) Sreesanth at the end of a match.“One thing I’d want to change in my life is that incident with Sreesanth. I want to remove that incident from my career,” Harbhajan said while speaking on R Ashwin’s YouTube show Kutti Stories.“That is the incident I would change from my list. What transpired was wrong, and I shouldn’t have done what I did. I apologised 200 times.“What I felt so bad about was that even years after that incident, I have been apologising every opportunity or stage I get. It was a mistake. We all make mistakes, and we hope and try never to repeat such mistakes.“He was my teammate, and we were playing together. Yes, in that game we were opponents. But it shouldn’t have gone to the level where we behaved in such a manner.“So yeah, that was my fault, and the only fault of his was that he provoked me — but that’s okay, actually. However, what I did was not okay. I said, ‘Sorry’,” Harbhajan said.“What hurt me even more, years later, was when I met his daughter.I was talking to her with a lot of love, and she said, ‘I don’t want to talk to you. You hit my father.’ My heart was shattered, and I was on the verge of tears.“I kept asking myself — what kind of impression have I left on her? She must be thinking of me in a poor light, right? She sees me as the guy who hit her father.“I felt so bad. I still apologise to his daughter, knowing I can’t undo what happened. I keep telling her, ‘If there’s anything I can do to make you feel better, or make you think I’m not that kind of person, please tell me.’“I just hope that when she grows up, she doesn’t see me in the same light. I hope she sees that her uncle is someone who will always be there for her and support her in any way he can.

R Ashwin announces retirement from Test cricket

Poll Do you believe there was ever a genuine rift between Ashwin and Harbhajan? Yes, definitely No, it was all speculation Not sure

Former India off-spinners Ravichandran Ashwin and Harbhajan Singh confronted each other about their careers, rivalry, and the jealousy factor that reportedly created a rift between the duo.Over the years, comparisons between Ashwin and fellow Indian spin legend Harbhajan Singh were frequent. Speculation about a rift between the two spinners has often surfaced, suggesting strained relations.In the explosive teaser of Season 3 of Kutti Stories with Ash, India's two great spinners can be seen clearing the air about the speculated rift between them.""This whole jealousy bit. Before I allow you to answer that, let me clarify something. People look at everything from their perspective. For example, if they are passing a comment on me, they believe that others would see the world through their eyes. This comment that you are jealous of this person who is interviewing you today — what would that..."" Ashwin asked Harbhajan.Harbhajan replied, ""Do you think I am jealous of you? You are sitting with me today, and we have spoken at length. Do you think I am that kind of person?""Ashwin, in a very nonchalant way, replied, ""Even if you are jealous at one point, it is justified. That is my point. I would never take it the wrong way because we are all human.Naturally, it is bound to be like that.""Ashwin also cleared the air about his retirement.""Some people believe I retired because of Washington Sundar. He is in the thick of things now. All of this is the perspective of others,"" he said.Ashwin picked up 765 wickets in international cricket in 379 innings, while Harbhajan scalped 707 wickets in his illustrious career.After Ashwin's retirement from Test cricket, Harbhajan had already dispelled such rumours, asserting that there is no truth to claims of discord between them.""I read social media only as much as I need to. If there is a standoff between me and Ashwin, or if there was ever any fight, quarrel or disagreement, I would be the first person to go up to him and ask what the issue is,"" Harbhajan Singh said on his YouTube channel.""But it was never like this, and it will never be like this, because whatever is in his destiny, he will get it, and I got whatever was in my destiny. He has been a phenomenal bowler for India. I am very happy for his achievements,"" he added.","Ravichandran Ashwin and Harbhajan Singh confronted each other about their careers, rivalry, and the jealousy factor that reportedly created a rift between the duo.

Van der Dussen finished unbeaten on 52 as South Africa reached their target with 16 balls remaining.""I was really chuffed with the bowling – 144 was never enough.
