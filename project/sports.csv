'Communal reason for not getting work?' Remark by AR Rahman sparks outcry,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/communal-reason-for-not-getting-work-remark-by-ar-rahman-sparks-outcry/articleshow/126629332.cms,"AR Rahman

AR Rahman Responds to Ramayan Controversy, Calls Epic a Story of Values Beyond Religion

Composer A R Rahman's claims that he possibly faced instances of ""communal"" discrimination in the last eight years in Bollywood caused an outcry on Saturday. During an interview with BBC Asian Network, Rahman was asked, "". ..today there's a lot of discrimination against the Tamil community within Bollywood. What was it like in the 1990s. Did you ever face...""Before the question was completed, Rahman answered, ""Maybe I didn't get to know all this stuff. Maybe God concealed all this stuff (laughed). I never felt all those..."" before he went on to say, ""Past eight years, maybe, because the power shift has happened... people who are not creative have the power now to decide things. And this might have been a communal thing also, but not in my face. But I would hear like Chinese whispers that this happened. And they booked you and the music company went and funded the movie and got five composers. And I said, 'Oh, that's great. Rest for me'.""The answer put out verbatim suggested there was a possible communal angle to some producers preferring other musicians. The interview said “you’re very proud of the soundtrack of ‘Chhaava’ and it is a really good soundtrack, but it is a divisive film.”The composer said, “It is… I think it cashed on divisiveness. But I think the core of it is to show bravery.”Interestingly, A R Rahman said that the director insisted on him working for the project. In his words, “The director, I told him like, ‘why do you need me for this?’ He said, ‘We need only you for this’.” ‘Chhaava’, directed by Laxman Utekar, was among biggest hits of 2025.The maestro has won a clutch of National Awards for best music; more recently for ‘Kaatru Veliyidai’ (Tamil, 2017) and ‘Mom’ (Hindi, 2017) and ‘Ponniyin Selvan 1’ (Tamil, 2022).Writer-lyricist Javed Akhtar sought to play down the controversy. Speaking to IANS, Akhtar said, “People in Mumbai have great respect for him. Maybe they think he has got busy with the West (producers). Or they think he is busier with his big shows. Small producers are also scared to approach him. I don’t think there is any communal element.”Bollywood singer Shaan also said there’s unlikely to be any communal angle to the situation. He told IANS, “I have sung so much over the years, yet even I don’t get work at times. But I don’t take it personally, because it is a personal matter; everyone has their own thinking and their own preferences… Rahman saab has a signature style and he is a great composer. His number of fans hasn’t gone down, but are increasing. I don’t think there is any communal or minority angle in music. Music doesn’t work that way.”","A R Rahman was asked about discrimination against the Tamil community in Bollywood. He said, ""Maybe I didn't get to know all this stuff.

‘BJP Won By Betrayal’: Uddhav Thackeray’s First Reaction On Mumbai Civic Poll Results

NEW DELHI: Alleging intimidation, coercion and unprecedented political pressure, Shiv Sena (UBT) president Uddhav Thackeray on Saturday launched a scathing attack against the Mahayuti over the BMC elections , calling the January 15 civic polls a “strange” contest fought as a matter of political survival by his opponents.Addressing a press conference, Thackeray alleged that the ruling alliance left no method unused to secure a victory. “This election was very strange. It felt like this was a life-and-death election for them. They opted for all methods, from cash to kidnapping our candidates; they forced candidates to withdraw their nominations,” he said.The UBT president also raised questions over the voting process and claimed he had received several complaints from citizens about their names missing from the voter lists. He said the results at many locations were “surprising” and did not match ground-level expectations.“Where did those numbers come from? Was it from some party office? Before counting numbers were seen on TV. In future, there will be no EVM, and the direct results will be declared. I have received several complaints from voters that their names were missing from the voter list. At various locations, the results are surprising.I had doubts about the exit polls,” said Thackeray.Despite the Mahayuti alliance of the BJP and the Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena clinching a majority, Thackeray said the outcome reflected the resilience of Shiv Sena (UBT) on the ground. Thanking voters who stood firm despite alleged attempts to intimidate them, he said, “Voters are the saviours of democracy,” and added that those who were not scared showed that the “strength of Shiv Sena UBT” remains intact.Thackeray expressed deep gratitude to citizens who backed the Shiv Shakti Alliance, a first-time collaboration between his faction of the Shiv Sena and his cousin Raj Thackeray’s Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS). He also apologised for not being able to campaign in all areas.“Yesterday, election results were announced. I could not visit many locations to campaign, but we got a good response at several places. I would at first apologise to voters where I was unable to reach. I thank those who voted for Shiv Shakti Alliance (with MNS),” he said.“The wish to have our Mayor wasn’t fulfilled, but the results have definitely shown the strength of Shiv Sena UBT,” Thackeray added.The 2026 BMC elections marked a historic political shift, ending nearly three decades of Thackeray family dominance over India’s richest civic body. The BJP emerged as the single largest party with 89 seats, while the BJP-led Mahayuti alliance crossed the halfway mark with 118 seats.Shiv Sena (UBT) secured 65 seats, polling 7,17,736 votes, which accounted for 13.13 per cent of the total votes cast. The MNS won six seats with 74,946 votes and a 1.37 per cent vote share. The Indian National Congress secured 24 seats, polling 2,42,646 votes, or 4.44 per cent of the vote share.Meanwhile, following the Mahayuti’s victory, political activity has intensified in Mumbai. Sources said the Shinde-led Shiv Sena has moved its newly elected corporators to a hotel in Bandra amid power negotiations. The party is also likely to demand the Mayor’s post in the BMC, reportedly as part of celebrations marking the centenary year of Shiv Sena founder Bal Thackeray, whose 100th birth anniversary falls on January 23.","The 2026 BMC elections marked a historic political shift, ending nearly three decades of Thackeray family dominance over India’s richest civic body.

NEW DELHI: The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) and Maharashtra civic elections 2026 have marked a decisive shift in the urban political landscape. Held after a delay of nearly four years due to legal challenges and prolonged administrator rule, the elections across 27 municipal corporations and 2,869 seats were widely seen as a test of governance credibility and of existence for some.The verdict was emphatic. The BJP-led Mahayuti alliance emerged as the dominant force in urban Maharashtra, winning 25 of the 29 municipal corporations across the state. In Mumbai, the Mahayuti crossed the majority threshold in the 227-member BMC, with the BJP seizing over 89 wards alone in its favour.With this, there ended the Shiv Sena 's uninterrupted control of the civic body since 1997 and marked the BJP’s first real capture of India’s richest municipal corporation.The biggest and the obvious winner of the civic polls verdict is Devendra Fadnavis and the Bharatiya Janata Party.The BJP has won over 89 wards of the BMC on its own, compared to 82 in 2017. In key wards such as Mulund West (Ward 103), the BJP defeated the MNS by a margin exceeding 12,000 votes.The BJP has emerged as the single largest party in Navi Mumbai with 65 seats, Kalyan-Dombivli (50), Mira-Bhayandar (78), Nashik (72), Panvel (55), Pune (119), Pimpri-Chinchwad (84), Solapur (87), Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar (57), Nanded (45) and Nagpur (102).The saffron party stunned the Pawars in the Pune polls, clinching 119 seats, with Ajit Pawar-led NCP coming in distant second with 27 and its ally NCP (SP) getting three seats, while the Congress managed 15 seats.In the 151-member Nagpur civic body, the BJP held sway, getting 102, while the Congress bagged a mere 34.Nashik saw the BJP bagging 72 seats, Shiv Sena 26, Shiv Sena (UBT) 15, Congress 3 and NCP 4.The BJP's victory streak continued in Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar, where it won 57 seats, followed by Shiv Sena with 15, Congress with one, while other parties registered with the SEC, especially the AIMIM, bagged 33 seats.With the BMC’s annual budget exceeding Rs 60,000 crore, control over Mumbai’s civic machinery also enhances the BJP’s long-term institutional leverage ahead of the 2029 assembly elections.For the Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena, the civic results offered political validation.Since the 2022 split, the Shinde faction’s central challenge has been legitimacy. The civic verdict, particularly in Mumbai and Thane, strengthened its claim. The party won 399 wards and emerged as the second largest party in Maharashtra civic polls.In Mira-Bhayandar and Ulhasnagar, the Shinde faction recorded near-sweeps, reflecting voter preference for continuity in infrastructure delivery over symbolic politics.The BJP–Shiv Sena–NCP Mahayuti alliance once again sealed the victory in Maharashtra.Despite contesting separately in some cities, the alliance demonstrated effective vote transferability in Mumbai, Nashik, and Nagpur.The alliance won 1,991 of 2,869 wards across Maharashtra.With a major victory, Mahayuti showed how to converted state-level power into grassroots and civic dominance.The All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) made modest but consequential gains in Maharashtra civic elections.It won 33 seats in the Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar Municipal Corporation and bagged a total of 126 seats across Maharashtra.The improved tally in Sambhajinagar marked a clear jump from the 2015 municipal corporation elections, when the party had secured 24 seats.AIMIM also registered gains in several urban pockets across the state.The party has won 21 seats in Malegaon, 14 in Nanded Waghala, 12 in Amravati, 10 in Dhule, 8 in Solapur, and eight in Mumbai. It also secured six seats in Nagpur, three in Akola, two each in Ahilyanagar and Jalna, and five seats in Thane.While these numbers remain small, AIMIM’s presence seems to have fragmented the opposition vote, particularly hurting Congress and Shiv Sena (UBT).When the results of the Maharashtra civic elections were being tallied, one of the most unexpected stories to emerge was not about seats won or wards lost. It was about narrative currency — how a Tamil Nadu BJP leader emerged as a winner without contesting.And it all started with the 'rasmalai' controversy which begun when while campaigning in Mumbai for the BMC elections, Annamalai had said the city didn't belong to Maharashtra alone as it was an international city.The remarks triggered a sharp exchange at a joint Shiv Sena (UBT)–MNS rally in Mumbai. MNS chief Raj Thackeray took a swipe at Annamalai, mocking him as 'rasmalai' and questioning his authority to comment on Mumbai. He also raised the slogan “hatao lungi, bajao pungi”, a phrase long used derogatorily against South Indians in the city.However, Mahayuti won and BJP MPs and supporters were soon having a field on social media, posting photos of 'rasmalai' and mocking Raj Thackeray.The biggest electoral setback was suffered by Uddhav Thackeray. From over 130 BMC seats in 2017, Sena (UBT) fell to 65 seats. Even traditional strongholds such as Gorai and parts of Mahim witnessed defeats.The loss of control of the BMC is a big blow to Uddhav the Sena has always maintained its control over the civic body.His long-anticipated reunion with estranged cousin Raj Thackeray also failed to make any impact on the ground.Overall, the party managed to bag only 155 across the state.The Indian National Congress emerged as one of the biggest losers of the BMC and Maharashtra civic elections because the results exposed its near-total erosion in urban politics.In the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, Congress, which fought in alliance with Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA), bagged 24 seats, a sharp fall from its already diminished presence in 2017, when it had crossed 30. Across Maharashtra’s 27 municipal corporations, the party managed roughly 324 wards out of 2,869.The Congress, which ran a muted campaign in the run-up to the polls, managed significant victories in Bhiwandi, where it won 30 seats, Chandrapur 27, and Latur 43.In Pune, once a Congress-influenced city, the party was restricted to fewer than five seats out of 162, while in Mumbai it failed to emerge as a serious contender in most wards.In Pune, it was reduced to fewer than five seats. The party which decided to go solo after that Thackeray cousins jouned hands, failed to make any impact in BMC polls where Uddhav's Sena won 72 seats.It seems that lack of a city-specific agenda, factional infighting and minimal national leadership presence during the campaign compounded the decline.For Raj Thackeray, the civic polls reinforced a long-term downward trajectory.The leader joined hands with his cousin Uddhav to keep the BJP at bay. But the results show how he failed miserably.During the election campaign, he tried to appeal around the idea of the 'Marathi Manoos' while invoking Balasaheb Thackeray. This politics of sentiment obviously has deep roots in Maharashtra’s history.He relied on fiery speeches, symbolic gestures and cultural flashpoints to command attention, often targeting migrants, linguistic outsiders, or perceived cultural dilution in Mumbai. Unlike mass welfare or governance-driven politics, his appeal was rooted in 'Marathi asmita'.This, however, failed to resonate with the voters. The MNS failed to secure major wins, while getting only 6 of 227 wards in Mumbai.At the state level, the party managed to get only 13 of 2869 wards.Sharad Pawar emerged as one of the biggest losers of the BMC and Maharashtra civic elections as the results exposed the steady erosion of his once-formidable grip over urban and organisational politics.For decades, Pawar was seen as the master strategist of Maharashtra, capable of shaping outcomes even when not in direct power. The civic verdict punctured that perception. The NCP (Sharad Pawar faction) failed to make any meaningful impact in the BMC, getting just 1 win in Mumbai wards and remaining marginal in Pune, a city long considered central to Pawar’s political influence.His strategy to join hands with nephew Ajit Pawar for the Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad municipal elections also failed as the BJP secured victory in these bodies.Statewide, the faction’s ward tally was 36 of 2869 wards, far below expectations for a party led by a veteran of his stature.Crucially, Pawar’s traditional role as an alliance-builder also lost relevance. Fragmentation within the opposition and the rise of a dominant Mahayuti alliance reduced his ability to act as a power broker. This time, though reports suggested he wanted the Maha Vikas Agadi to fight as a unit, he failed to keep the parties together, especially after the Thackeray cousins joined hands, pushing Congress to go solo.Despite being part of Mahayuti, Ajit Pawar has emerged as one of the losers this election. During the civic poll campaigns, Ajit Pawar repeatedly hit out at his own Mahayuti allies, Eknath Shinde and Devendra Fadnavis, exposing visible faultlines within the ruling alliance.As election date approached, he finally decided to unite with his uncle Sharad Pawar to contest Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad elections as a united front.His attacks were also unusually sharp for an alliance partner, with Pawar questioning why local bodies under BJP–Shinde control still struggled with water supply, roads and urban planning. In several rallies, he projected his faction as a corrective force within the government rather than a stakeholder in its record. .The civic results however suggest the tactic backfired. Ajit Pawar’s faction underperformed in Pune and Nashik, reinforcing the perception that public sparring with allies during elections diluted his credibility and bargaining power within the Mahayuti rather than strengthening it.Eventually, the Pawar lost their strongholds, Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad, to BJP with huge margin.","The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) and Maharashtra civic elections 2026 have marked a decisive shift in the urban political landscape.

Tom Brady on Matthew Stafford’s cold-weather adjustment

The Los Angeles Rams walk into one of the toughest environments in the NFL this weekend, and the spotlight once again lands on quarterback Matthew Stafford . The Rams face the Chicago Bears on January 18, 2026, at Soldier Field, where winter conditions often shape the outcome as much as play-calling.This time, the conversation took a sharper turn after Tom Brady weighed in. The seven-time Super Bowl champion offered perspective on cold-weather football while speaking about Stafford’s situation, not as criticism but as a reminder of how quickly conditions can test even proven quarterbacks.Brady shared his thoughts during an appearance on ""The Herd with Colin Cowherd"" earlier this month. While discussing playoff football and QB preparation, Brady pointed to weather as a subtle but real factor in Chicago’s favor.“Matt did play in Detroit for a long time, and in that division he went outside to Chicago and Green Bay,” Brady said on the FOX Sports show. “It’s not like he hasn’t played in it. But I will say, when I went to Tampa after my time in New England, it didn’t take me very long to get very soft in the cold.”TB-12's comment came with context, no doubt. Stafford spent 12 seasons with the Detroit Lions and played many games in the freezing conditions of the NFC North.But since joining the Rams in 2021, most of his winters in Southern California have been mild. Chicago expects temperatures near 10 degrees on Sunday, with wind gusts close to 20 miles per hour. Wind chill could push the “feels like” temperature closer to four degrees by kickoff.Brady explained how quickly the body reacts when cold exposure becomes rare. He recalled Tampa Bay’s NFC Championship Game trip to Green Bay during the 2020 season.“That game was around 32 to 34 degrees at kickoff,” Brady said during the interview. “It wasn’t minus-nine. That’s really cold. And that’s a big advantage for Chicago.”The Bears know this well. Over the past six weeks, Chicago leaned into Soldier Field’s conditions and used them to disrupt visiting offenses. Cold tightens hands. Plus, footing changes route depth and release speed.Stafford enters the matchup healthy and confident, but this test goes beyond arm strength. It demands patience, grip control, and trust in short throws. Brady’s message focused on adjustment, not weakness. Sunday’s game will show whether Stafford’s experience, preparation, and playoff poise can meet the challenge. If he adapts early, the weather becomes just another obstacle, not the story.Also Read: “Cry for sympathy and attention”: Tom Brady accused of seeking sympathy after post tied to Gisele Bündchen wedding","The Los Angeles Rams face the Chicago Bears on January 18, 2026, at Soldier Field.

Brad Marchand's Lifestyle IS NOT What You Think!

Brad Marchand's lifestyle collection highlights beyond NHL career earnings



Brad Marchand has established his name as one of the most controversial players in his generation in the NHL. The Florida Panthers forward, who plays on the ice, is a thug who thrives on confrontation, speed, and constant pressure. Off the ice, though, there is a much more down-to-earth and conservative lifestyle that is a consequence of family issues and decades of professional maturity.After a long time of 16 seasons with the Boston Bruins, Marchand was transferred to the Florida Panthers, which was a new step not only in his playing career, but also in his personal priorities. Opposite to his most famous counterparts, who would flaunt their luxury in public view, the lifestyle options of Marchand are more symbiotic as they target comfort, long life, and family stability instead of showing off.The number of cars that Brad Marchand owns is quite small, according to the NHL standards. Instead of having a collection of luxury or exotic cars, he has been known to prefer performance cars that are reliable and used on a daily basis. His low-profile public image has been reflected in teammates and the media often reporting on his tendency to be practical rather than status symbols.Marchand is another who does not overindulge in excesses, with watches and accessories.He has been caught with high-quality Swiss watches, though, nothing that indicates an obsession with ultra-rare or headline-grabbing luxury watches. His choices are more inclined towards traditional design and usability, which is expected of an athlete concerned with dependability and routine.The greatest portion of the personal assets of Brad Marchand is comprised of real estate. His lengthy tenure with the Boston Bruins also saw him invest in residential development in the Greater Boston region, with emphasis placed on privacy and a friendly area. After relocating to the Florida Panthers, the family of Marchand remained in a more peaceful Florida community, preferring room and comfort to showbiz places.There is also a lifestyle that Marchand does not accumulate, which shapes his lifestyle. Publicity about high-end collections of art, supercars, and speculative luxury investments is absent. Rather, his expenditure focuses on long-term security, family life with his wife, Katrina Sloane, and offering security to his children.In a world where NHL superstars are fond of making lifestyle properties their personal brands, Brad Marchand can be viewed as restrained. His collections are full of a player who invests intensity to compete, but who keeps his personal life as simple as possible.

What’s the status of William Nylander, Tom Wilson, and Leo Carlsson ahead of upcoming games?

NHL teams have begun to feel the squeeze as injuries start to dictate their strategies regarding games and players even more. Willy Nylander is the key man for the Maple Leafs, who left the game on Thursday night due to a lower-body injury, and now the team is uncertain about his presence for the next games.Other teams are going through similar experiences. The Washington Capitals are monitoring Tom Wilson closely after he has been absent for some time, while the Ducks are already making changes after it was confirmed that Carlsson will not play for weeks.After sustaining a lower-body injury while playing against the Vegas Golden Knights, William Nylander is now doubtful for the next game. Coach Craig Berube stated that there is no specific time fixed for Nylander's return from the injury. Nylander has been off the ice for a while now, but he continues to be the top scorer for Toronto this season.Tom Wilson in Washington had an optional skate, and he has not been ruled out for the game versus Florida. According to team officials report that Wilson has been out for five games, but he is almost there to return. Meanwhile, there is a report from the coaching staff that Pierre-Luc Dubois will be unavailable till after the Olympic break.The Anaheim Ducks announced that Leo Carlsson, after undergoing a procedure for a thigh injury, will be out for three to five weeks. The young center not only leads the Ducks in points but was also just recently selected to Sweden's Olympic roster, thus making his recovery timeline quite important.Elsewhere, the Philadelphia Flyers reported that goalie Dan Vladar is day-to-day, while the Minnesota Wild added Matt Boldy and Joel Eriksson Ek to their injured list. Moreover, the Senators' goalie situation seems to have improved as Linus Ullmark has come back to training, but there is still no schedule for his playing return.Injuries are forcing several NHL teams to balance between these competing factors. The speed of these players' returns will possibly be one of the factors influencing the results of this season's last segment.","William Nylander is doubtful for the next game for the Toronto Maple Leafs.

Andy Reid faces growing uncertainty as another long-time Chiefs assistant may exit during a critical offseason,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/andy-reid-faces-growing-uncertainty-as-another-long-time-chiefs-assistant-may-exit-during-a-critical-offseason/articleshow/126611926.cms,"Andy Reid (via Getty Images)

The Chiefs’ offensive identity could shift if veteran voices keep leaving

After a disappointing 2025 season, the Kansas City Chiefs require a serious evolution, and head coach Andy Reid is moving quickly to reshape essential parts of his staff. However, new uncertainty has emerged around one of his longest-tenured assistants on the team. According to Chiefs Blitz on X, veteran offensive line coach Andy Heck could reportedly be walking away in the near future, which adds another layer of pressure to an already delicate transition period for the Chiefs.Losing Andy Heck would be more than a routine coaching change, as he has been a central figure in shaping Kansas City’s offensive foundation for many years. He has been instrumental in guiding units through injuries and lineup changes. Thus, it will be an almost impossible task for someone living up to his standards with his replacement.Despite constant shuffling in 2025, the Chiefs’ offensive line finished squarely in the middle of the league and protected the quarterback at a top-ten rate. That consistency helped preserve a competitive edge during a turbulent season. Another thing that makes things more complicated is the news that offensive coordinator Matt Nagy appears poised to move on, and his departure could influence Heck’s decision.If Heck steps away, Kansas City would not just be replacing an offensive line coach, as they would also be losing their de facto run game overseer. This uncertainty comes following the firings of Todd Pinkston and Connor Embree, signalling accountability after a disappointing offensive year.Meanwhile, movement across both sides of the ball continues as assistants interview for promotions or accept college roles. The Chiefs find themselves in a rare moment of flux after missing the postseason for the first time in years. With the potential changes incoming, the Chiefs are in for some significant changes ahead.For Reid, he understands that he must refresh a staff that underperformed while preserving the institutional knowledge that helped build a dynasty. It remains to be seen how he navigates the next few months, which could shape Kansas City’s identity far beyond the 2026 season and come back with guns blazing.",Andy Heck could be leaving the Kansas City Chiefs in the near future.

Winnipeg Jets defenseman Collin Miller to remain away for several weeks due to knee surgery

Winnipeg Jets Practice Report: Colin Miller

Winnipeg Jets defenseman Colin Miller has undergone knee surgery recently and is now listed as week-to-week, as reported by head coach Scott Arniel. This update comes amid ongoing challenges for the Jets' blue line. In his statement, Arniel noted that the procedure was similar to the arthroscopic knee surgery that goaltender Connor Hellebuyck underwent earlier in the season.According to reports, Miller sustained a knee injury during a game against the New Jersey Devils on January 10. This injury forced him to exit early with a lower-body issue. He has already missed his third straight game, including a matchup against Toronto on January 17, 2025. The 33-year-old veteran had recorded one assist, 16 shots on goal, 10 blocked shots, and 25 hits in 15 games this season. Let’s take a look at how it’s going to affect the Winnipeg Jets. Winnipeg Jets defenseman Collin Miller has been sidelined due to a lower-body injury, forcing the Jets to finish Sunday's game against the New Jersey Devils with just five defensemen. Reports suggest Miller has been ruled out for the remainder of the contest with a lower-body injury, the team said.Actually, the six-foot-one defender was injured in last Sunday’s 4-3 win over the New Jersey Devils following an awkward collision with Arseny Grisyuk. Following this, he went hard into the boards in the first period and had to be helped off the ice before immediately heading down the tunnel.However, Miller came out before the second period to give it a try, but turned around quickly and limped to the locker room, as per The Winnipeg Free Press' Ken Wiebe.Meanwhile, he is undergoing a similar surgery procedure like Hellebuyck. Reports suggest that Hellebuyck was initially given a timeline of four-to-six weeks, but returned to game action for the Jets just three weeks following the surgery.Besides, Miller has one assist, 16 shots on net, 25 hits, 10 blocked shots, and a minus-8 rating. In 15 games played this season, Miller has recorded one assist while averaging 13:45 of ice time. However, it has not been decided yet when Miller will be returning to the team.Apart from Miller, defensemen like Neal Pionk and Haydn Fleury continue to recover from a frightening incident earlier this season who suffered multiple injuries. With three regular defensemen sidelined, Winnipeg has been forced to dip into its organizational depth.","Winnipeg Jets defenseman Colin Miller has undergone knee surgery and is now listed as week-to-week.

Mina Kimes, Ryan Clark, Hannah Storm, Dan Orlovsky, and Marcus Spears, ESPN’s NFL Live crew, all picked the same team, just as they did before when the Philadelphia Eagles faced the San Francisco 49ers. Who did they pick then? Unanimously, the Eagles. And what happened?

For now, let’s check out cybercitizens’ reactions to Houston’s unanimous vote.“No, not with Nico Collins out. I know Houston’s D is good, but I don’t think they’re gonna beat the pats,” declared one X user. Texans wide receiver Nico Collins is out with a concussion for Sunday’s AFC Divisional Round against New England. He did not practice all week. Christian Kirk will replace him as WR1.Another commented, “It’s a bad omen when Dan Orlovsky and Ryan Clark are on the same side [crystal ball emoji].” The two analysts often have opposing perspectives and fiery debates.A third user said, “A unanimous panel pick is the ultimate bulletin board material for an opponent.”It just shows Houston is more than capable of defeating New England.A fourth user shared a screenshot of the NFL Live crew unanimously picking the Eagles, with the caption, “Remember this?”A fifth user is waiting for the crew to realize New England would win: “Can’t wait for the moment they all start pretending they knew the Patriots would win [two crying emojis].”A user said NFL MVP-candidate Drake Maye would put pressure on Houston’s defense: “31-17 Pats, Texans gonna get exposed on defense by the MVP [fire emoji].”Another user sided with the Texans, but after seeing the crew unanimously pick Houston, chose New England instead: “I was thinking Houston as well but after seeing all them pick Houston it will be the patriots winning.”A user believes that even though Bill Belichick is no longer leading the Patriots, Stefon Diggs’ “nobody believes in us” fiery pregame speeches will help beat the Texans:“The full panel sweep is the ultimate kiss of death in this league. Patriots being 3-point favorites at home and nobody taking them is wild. Bill Belichick might be gone but the “nobody believes in us” energy in Foxborough is gonna be through the roof now.”Another user supposedly made fun of the crew, saying, “And they get paid for this [laughing face emoji] Go pats.” A third user wrote, “Pats about to make ‘em pay for that love.”Mina Kimes exclaimed, ""No way!

Steelers Nation sends clear message after Mike Tomlin’s exit from Pittsburgh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/steelers-nation-sends-clear-message-after-mike-tomlins-exit-from-pittsburgh/articleshow/126556595.cms,"Mike Tomlin steps down as Steelers head coach and fans gave mixed reactions(Image via: Getty Images)

Fan reaction underscores why change felt necessary for Mike Tomlin

Mike Tomlin’s exit from Pittsburgh did not spark chaos or outrage. Instead, it brought clarity. Recently, Steelers Nation responded with a steady, unified tone that revealed exactly where the fan base stood after nearly two decades under the same leadership.For years, Tomlin symbolized stability. He delivered winning seasons, maintained control inside the locker room, and kept Pittsburgh competitive in an unforgiving league. However, as time passed, postseason disappointment slowly reshaped expectations. While regular-season success continued, January failures began to define the conversation. As a result, when Tomlin stepped away, fans did not push back. Instead, they understood the timing.The clearest measure of sentiment surfaced on Jan 16, 2026, when the Essentially Sports NFL Huddle poll asked whether Tomlin stepping down was the right decision. Out of 3,289 total votes, 2,131 fans answered yes, amounting to 64.79 percent.More importantly, the margin reflected acceptance rather than anger. Fans did not dismiss Tomlin’s accomplishments. Instead, they acknowledged that results had stalled.Pittsburgh lost 7 straight playoff games between Jan 2018 and Jan 2025, and with each loss, confidence in its postseason direction eroded.Fan comments explained that shift in thinking. One fan wrote, “Time for a change; everybody knows y’all plays, you're killing the defense, keeping them on the field all day, because all the offense does is 3 and out.” That reaction pointed directly to frustration with conservative offensive strategy and the repeated burden placed on the defense. Another fan chimes in, “He is an awful coach. When is the last Super Bowl he won?”While extreme, that comment shows how distant Super Bowl XLIII now feels to fans who judge success by championships.In the midst of chaos, ESPN's Mike Greenberg on ""Get Up"" sent a bold message to Steelers fans, saying, ""I'm telling you, 'Be careful what you wish for. '"" Because I have lived the other side of this.""Meanwhile, Tomlin addressed his decision privately during a team meeting on Jan. 14, according to league reports. Although the Steelers organization has not shared details publicly, focus quickly shifted toward what comes next.The following day, NFL Network insider Ian Rapoport discussed Tomlin’s future during an NFL Network broadcast. “There have been murmurs for a long time that Mike Tomlin would step away and then do television,” Rapoport said during the segment. “That interest is real.”Consequently, many fans appear comfortable with that outcome. Veteran head coach Tomlin’s command, clarity, and presence have long stood out during press conferences, making a transition to television feel natural.Ultimately, Tomlin leaves Pittsburgh Steelers with a 193-114-2 record and a Super Bowl title won at age 36, the youngest head coach to achieve that milestone. Those achievements remain respected.Still, Steelers Nation sent a clear message. The appreciation remained. The expectations evolved. And the transition felt necessary.Also Read: Mike Tomlin leaves Steelers after 19 seasons, Art Rooney opens up on coaching search and future goals","Pittsburgh Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin stepped down after 19 seasons.

Mike Tomlin Steelers legacy extends far beyond wins and losses



Mike Tomlin Steelers news hit the NFL like a thunderclap this week, not because of scandal or failure, but because of legacy. After nearly two decades of unbroken competitiveness, the Pittsburgh Steelers suddenly found themselves without the one constant that defined their modern era. The timing made it sting more. The setting made it louder. And the silence that followed said even more than the announcement itself.The decision came after a bruising Wild Card loss to C.J. Stroud and the Houston Texans, closing a chapter that rarely dipped and never collapsed. Nineteen seasons. Zero losing records. A Super Bowl ring earned early, followed by years of relevance in a league built to forget yesterday. In Pittsburgh, consistency is currency, and Tomlin printed it for almost two decades.Days after the news settled, the most revealing reaction did not come from analysts or former players. It came from home. Kiya Tomlin, his wife, broke her silence through a series of Instagram Stories that reframed the moment away from football results and toward personal impact.“Incredibly proud” is how she described her husband’s journey, pointing to what mattered most once the headsets came off.“Over the past few days the messages and testimonies shared by current and former players — the men who knew him best — have been deeply moving. They’ve affirmed what I’ve always known to be true about his purpose and character,” she wrote.Her words shifted the focus from trophies to people. She explained that his purpose was “to help young men become great individuals,” achieved through “Coaching and fatherhood.” That, she said, defined his real success.She described his “true legacy” as “the men who passed through his locker rooms over more than 30 years of coaching, [their] own children, and hundreds of young people across the region he personally poured into.” She called it “his coaching tree” and “the achievement we are most proud of.”Kiya also acknowledged Pittsburgh directly, closing her message with gratitude.“Thank you, Pittsburgh. Thank you for your support, your words of kindness, and the warm reception our family has received over the last 19 years.”What comes next remains open. Mike Tomlin has stepped away for now, leaving the door ajar rather than closed. Television work is possible. A return someday is not ruled out. But for the moment, the story is not about his next job. It is about a rare NFL career that ended with dignity, purpose, and respect intact. Tomlin was seen supporting his daughter Harley in her gymnastic meet.Also Read: Did Alix Earle really check Braxton Berrios’ phone?

Tyson Gay's setbacks, personal loss, and recent updates

Tyson Gay is one of the fastest sprinters the United States has ever produced. Known for his explosive speed and smooth running style, Gay made history by becoming the fastest American in the 100 meters. He dominated the world stage in the late 2000s, won major titles, and became a symbol of U.S. sprinting during an era ruled by global stars.Tyson Gay’s current net worth is estimated to be between $6 million and $15 million as of 2026. Celebrity Net Worth lists his wealth at $6 million, while some 2025 sports finance reports suggest it may have reached $12–15 million at its peak, mainly from Adidas endorsement deals, race winnings, and performance bonuses earned before his 2013 doping suspension.His income came from prize money, sponsorships, appearance fees, and bonuses during his peak years in track and field. Gay also earned from brand deals, mainly with Adidas, before his career ended.Tyson Gay was born on August 9, 1982, in Lexington, Kentucky. He grew up in a family that loved sports. His grandmother ran track in college, his mother was a sprinter, and his older sister Tiffany was also a fast runner in school.Tyson has often said his sister pushed him to run faster while growing up.He later attended the University of Arkansas, where he studied sociology and marketing. While there, he became the school’s first NCAA 100-meter champion and helped Arkansas win a national title. His college success played a big role in launching his professional career.Tyson Gay is best known for holding the American record in the 100 meters at 9.69 seconds, set in 2009. This time ties him as the second-fastest man in history, behind Usain Bolt. According to World Athletics, Gay remains the fastest American sprinter ever.His biggest moment came at the 2007 World Championships in Osaka, where he won three gold medals in the 100 m, 200 m, and 4×100 m relay. He became only the second man to win all three events at a single World Championships. He also won the IAAF World Athlete of the Year award in 2007 and multiple ESPY Awards.In 2013, Gay tested positive for a banned substance and accepted responsibility. He was suspended and later lost his 2012 Olympic silver medal. Adidas paused its sponsorship following the suspension, which affected its earnings.In the year 2016, Gay endured a heart-wrenching loss when his 15-year-old daughter, Trinity Gay, was shot dead in Kentucky. This occurrence left a profound impact on him and ultimately pushed him to become a public speaker on the issue of gun violence.In recent years, Tyson Gay has stayed away from professional racing. As of 2025, there are no reports of coaching roles or official athletics positions, according to USA Track & Field. He keeps a low public profile and remains one of the most respected names in American sprinting history.","Tyson Gay’s current net worth is estimated to be between $6 million and $15 million as of 2026.

Travis Kelce reportedly causing tension with Taylor Swift as insiders hint at stress over life after football,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/travis-kelce-reportedly-causing-tension-with-taylor-swift-as-insiders-hint-at-stress-over-life-after-football/articleshow/126544575.cms,"Taylor Swift is reportedly concerned about Travis Kelce’s emotional well-being as he considers retirement from the NFL. Insiders say football has long defined Kelce’s identity, making the transition difficult. While opportunities await beyond the game, the uncertainty has created stress. Kelce has acknowledged the challenge publicly while evaluating his physical readiness and future.

Why Taylor Swift is concerned about Travis Kelce’s next chapter

The conversation around Travis Kelce has quietly shifted from wins and playoff runs to something far more personal. After years of structuring life around training camps, late-season pushes, and Super Bowl expectations, the Kansas City tight end now stands at a crossroads that extends well beyond football. Those close to him say the decision is no longer just about stats or trophies. It is about identity.At the center of that reflection is Taylor Swift , who is reportedly focused less on whether Kelce can still play and more on how he will feel once the game no longer defines his routine. Football has shaped his purpose for most of his adult life. Walking away from that can leave a silence that success outside the sport does not always fill.Sources describe Taylor Swift as deeply supportive but realistic about the emotional shift retirement can bring. One insider explained her concern clearly, saying, ""She thinks he has a huge world waiting for him outside football, but also worries how he’ll fare emotionally when he does hang up his cleats. It’s been the cornerstone of his life for so long now.""Travis Kelce has not avoided the topic. Speaking recently on the New Heights podcast, he admitted the decision weighs heavily as he evaluates his health and long-term readiness.His words showed both hesitation and passion for the grind he knows so well.""And I don't know, it's a tough thing to navigate,"" Kelce said. ""But at the same time, you know, I think if my body can heal up and rest up and I can feel confident that I can go out there and give it another 18, 20, 21-week run. I think I would do it in a heartbeat.""The discussion has reached the top of the organization. Kansas City Chiefs head coach Andy Reid acknowledged the uncertainty while defending Kelce’s ability. “We all love Travis,"" Reid said.""Trav can still play. I’m not trying questioning that part or any of it. I’m not trying to avoid your question, but I know there’s time. Last year, I was asked kind of the same thing. We’ve got a little bit of time to figure everything out, and so does Trav.”Even his brother Jason Kelce has weighed in, offering blunt opinions about the season and the road ahead. For now, Kelce is balancing recovery, reflection, and preparations for his Rhode Island wedding. Whether football remains part of that future is still unanswered, but the emotional stakes are now impossible to ignore.Also Read: Travis Kelce appears conflicted on staying in the NFL as Taylor Swift future pulls him elsewhere","Taylor Swift is reportedly concerned about Travis Kelce's emotional well-being as he considers retirement from the NFL.

Madison Beer’s big week contrasts with Justin Herbert’s playoff exit

The end of the NFL season can feel abrupt, especially for teams with playoff expectations. For the Los Angeles Chargers, that reality arrived quickly after their wild-card loss to the New England Patriots. While the defeat closed the book on another challenging year for Justin Herbert , the week unfolded very differently for someone close to him.As Herbert processed the disappointment of an early playoff exit, his girlfriend, Madison Beer, was celebrating a major career moment. The singer released her new album, Locket, on Friday, and the rollout came with a highly visible spotlight. An advertisement for the album appeared on a Times Square jumbotron in New York City, marking a milestone moment in her music career.Beer shared photos of the Times Square display on her Instagram story, pairing the photos with her song “For the Night.” The timing stood out. While Herbert’s season had just ended in frustration, Beer was enjoying one of the biggest promotional moments of her career. The Chargers’ playoff run ended with a loss to New England, despite the team making it back to the postseason. Herbert struggled to find consistency during the game and finished with 159 passing yards.Afterward, he addressed his performance honestly in his postgame comments. ""I didn't play weel enough and didn't make any plays,"" Herbert said. ""We let the defense down today.""The loss marked Herbert’s third career playoff appearance, but once again, the Chargers failed to reach the divisional round. It added to the growing pressure surrounding a quarterback who has delivered strong regular-season play but has yet to make a deep postseason run.Earlier in the week, Beer had another milestone moment when she appeared on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. The performance came just ahead of the album release and marked her debut on the late-night stage. She later shared photos and videos from the appearance on Instagram with a caption that captured her excitement. ""oh what a night! bad enough debut on @fallontonight""For the show, Beer wore an off-white halter-neck dress with a fitted silhouette and a high slit, drawing attention as she promoted her new music. Herbert and Beer confirmed their relationship publicly in October, when they were seen sharing a kiss on the sidelines before a Chargers game against Washington. Since then, Beer has regularly been spotted supporting Herbert at games, including a Week 17 appearance against the Houston Texans.As Herbert heads into another offseason focused on improvement and answers, Beer’s career continues to gain momentum.","Madison Beer released her new album, Locket, on Friday.

Nicol Delago’s breakthrough and Lindsey Vonn’s experience light up Tarvisio



Italy’s alpine ski team continues its strong run with less than three weeks left before the Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics. On Saturday, Nicol Delago delivered a landmark moment by winning her first World Cup race in the downhill on home snow in Tarvisio. The result added to the growing confidence around the Italian camp as Olympic preparations enter the final stretch.The race also underlined the remarkable form of Lindsey Vonn . At 41, the American legend finished third, securing her fifth podium in five downhill races this season. With the Olympics approaching in Italy, both Delago’s breakthrough victory and Vonn’s consistency sent a strong message to the rest of the field.Nicol Delago topped the timing sheets with a winning margin of 0.20 seconds over Germany’s Kira Weidle-Winkelmann. Lindsey Vonn followed closely, just 0.26 seconds behind the Italian. Delago had shown strong signs earlier by leading the final training session on Friday. Until now, her best World Cup results had been three second-place and two third-place finishes. Her younger sister, Nadia Delago, who won Olympic bronze in downhill at the 2022 Beijing Games, finished 10th in this race.The Tarvisio downhill returned to the World Cup calendar for the first time in 15 years. Vonn was one of only two skiers in the field with prior racing experience on the course. In her earlier appearances at Tarvisio across different disciplines, she had recorded two victories and four second-place finishes. After the race, Vonn explained that while the track itself felt unfamiliar, she clearly remembered the electric atmosphere.Talking about the race, it was quite challenging due to fog hanging over the middle section of the course, reducing visibility. Delago briefly lost control when her skis split apart in the fog but recovered quickly. She then increased her lead at every split and celebrated joyfully at the finish. Vonn posted the fastest speeds at both checkpoints, reaching 136.3 kph, but a slight detour into fresh snow cost her time.In the downhill standings, Vonn extended her lead to 144 points over Emma Aicher. She also moved up to third overall with 510 points. The Olympic downhill in Cortina is set for February 8, with a super-G scheduled in Tarvisio on Sunday.","Nicol Delago wins her first World Cup downhill on home snow in Tarvisio.

When Grammy-winning rapper Cardi B was spotted in a Gillette Stadium VIP suite, cheering on her boyfriend Stefon Diggs with New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, we knew something was amiss. Something was pin pointing to their shared history. But who would go back and turn the pages of history? No worries. We’ve done that for all.The “Bodak Yellow” singer was spotted dancing with the Patriots owner at a Fanatics party during Super Bowl LIII weekend in Atlanta in 2019. Cardi was scheduled to perform at Michael Rubin’s Fanatics party at the College Football Hall of Fame.The “Am I the Drama?” creator co-headlined the event with rapper Meek Mill, who partnered with Kraft on Reform Alliance, a criminal justice reform organization supported by Jay-Z and Van Jones.In a 2019 appearance on 98.5 The Sports Hub’s “Toucher and Rich” program [now, it’s Toucher & Hardy], Kraft discussed forging relationships with the hip-hop community.“Honest to goodness, I don’t force it,” Kraft said. “We live in a world where all of us have to find ways to build bridges and connect with everybody. There’s good in every situation, and you try to understand it and relate to it.That’s how you understand how the world works, when you try to keep people together to win championships, which is not easy, guys.”The Patriots had beaten the Los Angeles Rams 13-3 and won Super Bowl LIII. It was the sixth and final Super Bowl win for Tom Brady as a Patriot. He won his seventh Super Bowl as a Buccaneer. Anyway, coming back to Kraft and Cardi B. What happened at the party?Kraft danced to Cardi B’s performance on her song “Money.” Describing the dance with Offset’s ex-wife, Kraft said, “Meek Mill kept saying, ‘You gotta go out there. You gotta go out there. They don’t think you can dance.’Once someone puts you on the defensive, they don’t expect me to follow the beat, not that I had much rhythm. I don’t think most of my colleagues expect to see me Super Bowl weekend hanging with Cardi B and trying to show her a few moves.”Dov Kleiman, an NFL aggregator, shared a wholesome picture of Kraft and Cardi taken six years after their first meeting. Notable changes: The owner has reportedly lost a few pounds, while the “I Like It” singer is sporting her post-Rhinoplasty look.Diggs’ partner underwent a nose job [rhinoplasty] in 2020. She tried non-surgical nose fillers around 2018-2019, but they made her nose look longer and wider. So, she had corrective surgery in 2020 because the fillers backfired.“I always felt like I had a big nose,” Cardi said via The Glow Memo’s Michelle Villett. “Even before I was famous, I was like, ‘Damn, I’ve got my daddy’s nose.’ I was always afraid to do my nose, and I finally took the step.”Also Read: Stefon Diggs scans the stands searching for Cardi B after New England Patriots’ big 42-10 win over New York Jets",New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft and rapper Cardi B were spotted together at Super Bowl LIII.

Bears hold a clear weather edge

The Los Angeles Rams are heading into one of the toughest environments in football, and Tom Brady believes the weather alone could tilt the balance. Ahead of the Rams’ divisional-round clash against the Chicago Bears, Brady offered a clear warning about how extreme cold can quietly work against quarterbacks who are used to warmer conditions.The game at Soldier Field is expected to be played in freezing temperatures, with strong winds making conditions even harsher. For Brady, who built much of his playoff legacy in New England winters, this is not just small talk. He knows exactly how unforgiving January football in Chicago can be.Speaking on FOX Sports, Brady admitted that even experienced quarterbacks can be “softened” by time spent in warmer climates. While he acknowledged that Matthew Stafford has played in cold-weather cities before, Brady stressed that habits change quickly.He pointed to his own move from New England to Tampa Bay as an example. After years of playing in freezing conditions, he said it did not take long to adjust to warmth and lose that edge in the cold. According to him, the difference between 30 degrees and sub-zero wind chills can be massive, especially when grip, muscle movement, and timing come into play.Stafford spent years with the Detroit Lions, but many of those games were played indoors.Since joining the Los Angeles Rams, he has been based in California, where cold-weather preparation is not part of daily life. That matters because cold air can stiffen fingers, slow reactions, and affect ball control all critical for a quarterback who relies on timing and precision.Reports suggest Stafford may even use extra gear, such as thermal layers, to cope with the cold. But Brady warned that too much protection can also limit movement. Finding the right balance is a challenge in itself.Brady believes the Bears have a strong advantage simply because of familiarity. Chicago has already played multiple games in freezing conditions this season, and their players are used to adjusting routines, equipment, and mindset accordingly.The Rams, by contrast, are coming off a warm-weather playoff win and now face a sudden shift. For an offense that thrives on rhythm and passing efficiency, swirling winds and icy air could disrupt their flow.Brady didn't count the Rams out, even though he warned them. He praised their coaching and offensive flexibility, saying that smart changes might still help them stay competitive.Still, his message was clear: talent alone may not be enough. In Chicago, survival often comes down to who handles the cold better and Brady knows from experience that winter football rarely shows mercy",The Los Angeles Rams face the Chicago Bears at Soldier Field on Sunday.

Jack Eichel's OT goal secures Vegas Golden Knights' strong comeback once again



NHL Highlights | Maple Leafs vs. Golden Knights - January 15, 2026

Jack Eichel scored at 2:44 of overtime as the Vegas Golden Knights finished off a thrilling late-game rally to defeat the Toronto Maple Leafs 6-5 Thursday night at T-Mobile Arena. The winning goal capped off the Golden Knights’ sixth straight win and is the latest impressive display from one of the league’s hottest teams.Vegas was down by two goals in the third period but surged back to tie the game with only seven seconds left in the game. They won the game in the overtime period. The game was marred by the Toronto team's poor defense, despite their offense putting up a great display.Jack Eichel provided the crucial element with the assist in overtime after Mark Stone chipped the loose puck from a 2-on-1 attempt.Stone spotted Eichel on the backside and caught him with the pass, and the forward easily deceived the shot with a backhand deke before putting the puck past Toronto goaltender Joseph Woll.“We’re competing when we don’t have the puck in overtime,” Eichel said. “[Stone] hits a post right there before we score, and we had a few changes. Credit to the whole group. It was a come-from-behind win, and we found a way to get a goal late there.”Toronto dominated most of the first period, taking a 3-1 lead thanks to goals from Morgan Rielly, William Nylander, and Auston Matthews. John Tavares and Scott Laughton also scored goals, but Toronto could not finish off the game.Nylander scored and assisted, then left early in the first with a lower body injury. That’s just another problem Toronto has. Woll stopped 27 shots in goal as they fell to 23-16-8 with a key road game loss.Despite earning a point, Toronto was left frustrated since they lost another lead they had towards the end of the match. Vegas currently leads the NHL with eight overtime victories when trailing in the third period this year. Adin Hill stopped 23 shots in his first game back from an injury.Momentum is building, and confidence is running high as the Golden Knights are proving that they are capable of winning in various ways as the playoff season heats up.Also read: Mark Stone's exceptional goal within 25 seconds of overtime marks Vegas Golden Knights' 5th winning streak",Vegas Golden Knights beat Toronto Maple Leafs 6-5 in overtime.

Sidney Crosby gives Penguins an early lead as power play dominates Flyers’ struggles



NHL Highlights | Flyers vs. Penguins - January 15, 2026

The Penguins snapped their three-game streak without a goal with a resounding 6-3 victory over the Philadelphia Flyers at PPG Paints Arena last night. The Penguins received a boost with the return of Sidney Crosby, who contributed a goal and an assist, while Evgeni Malkin and Tommy Novak chipped in two assists apiece. Goaltender Stuart Skinner also had 30 saves, keeping the Penguins ahead all the way.This was a much-needed win for the Penguins, as they had only scored two goals in the last three matches. The Philadelphia, on the other hand, continues to struggle, as the Flyers have extended their losing streak to five games, having been outscored 25-9 in the process. Matvei Michkov, Rodrigo Abols, and Nick Seeler found the net for Philadelphia, but it wasn’t enough to challenge Pittsburgh’s balanced attack.Pittsburgh established an early lead with Justin Brazeau scoring on a power play just seconds before the first period’s end. Bryan Rust added a second power-play goal midway through the period, followed by Egor Chinakhov extending the lead to 3-0 in the second. Philadelphia responded quickly with Abols deflecting a shot from Cam York, but the Flyers’ early efforts weren’t enough to slow the Penguins. Goalie Samuel Ersson allowed three goals on 14 shots before Aleksei Kolosov replaced him in relief, making 13 saves.Special teams were a key factor, with Crosby converting a third-period power play to make it 5-1. Philadelphia’s ongoing difficulties on the penalty kill have been costly, as they have allowed 12 power-play goals in their past eight games. Connor Dewar added another for Pittsburgh before Seeler and Michkov finished the scoring for the Flyers, making it 6-3.The win for Pittsburgh showed their strength in taking advantage of crucial moments and dictating play, while for Philadelphia, it seems their season of struggles continues. Flyers head coach Rick Tocchet revealed a lack of discipline in play, such as penalties for stick infractions and poor positioning on some plays. As both teams can expect a long season, it will be crucial for both Pittsburgh to keep up their strong play and for Philadelphia to get back on track after such a tough stretch.Also Read: Sidney Crosby revisits the moment Penguins were called soft, revealing what Michel Therrien really meant back then","Pittsburgh Penguins beat Philadelphia Flyers 6-3 at PPG Paints Arena last night.

‘I got kicked off the team’: How Travis Kelce turned one career-wrecking mistake into a $90 Million net worth,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/i-got-kicked-off-the-team-how-travis-kelce-turned-one-career-wrecking-mistake-into-a-90-million-net-worth/articleshow/126569218.cms,"Travis Kelce net worth reflects NFL dominance, media ownership, and long-term financial discipline. (Image via Getty)

From suspension and rookie contracts to NFL extensions, endorsements, and media power

Why Travis Kelce’s net worth story still starts with a failed drug test

Travis Kelce did not build his wealth quietly. He also did not build it overnight. Long before the Taylor Swift headlines, Kelce was already one of the most financially successful non-quarterbacks in NFL history. His $90 million net worth did not come from luck or timing. It came from discipline learned the hard way.As of early 2026, the Kansas City Chiefs tight end has turned sustained on-field dominance into a diversified financial operation that spans NFL contracts, endorsements, media rights, and equity investments. This is not a story about celebrity proximity. It is a story about failure, leverage, and long-term planning.According to Celebrity Net Worth, Travis Kelce’s net worth is estimated at $90 million as of 2025, a figure that aligns with reporting from Forbes and multiple contract databases. Kelce earned over $100 million in NFL contract value alone, before endorsements, bonuses, and media deals.Kelce entered the league as a third-round pick in 2013. His rookie contract paid $3.12 million over four years, including a signing bonus of just over $700,000.He missed nearly his entire rookie season due to injury, which delayed both production and leverage. That changed quickly.In 2016, Kelce signed a five-year, $46 million extension with $20 million guaranteed. In 2020, he added a four-year, $57.25 million extension with $28 million guaranteed. In April 2024, he signed a two-year, $34.25 million extension, including $17 million guaranteed.By the 2025 season, Kelce’s salary with Kansas City was estimated at $17 million, according to league contract figures. He accepted team-friendly structures to keep the roster competitive, a decision that helped produce three Super Bowl championships while preserving long-term brand value.Off the field, Kelce’s income now tilts heavily toward endorsements and media. Industry estimates place his endorsement earnings at $30 to $32 million annually, with partners including Nike, State Farm, Bud Light, Pfizer, McDonald’s, DirecTV, T-Mobile, and Casa Azul Tequila.The largest single shift came in 2024, when Kelce and his brother Jason secured a reported $100 million deal with Amazon ’s Wondery platform for their “New Heights” podcast. The deal transformed the show from a side project into a long-term media asset with advertising, licensing, and live event revenue.Kelce has also taken equity positions rather than one-time endorsement checks. In 2024, the Kelce brothers became major investors in Garage Beer Co., which reached a $200 million valuation following outside investment in 2025. He also holds stakes in multiple consumer, wellness, and lifestyle brands.Kelce’s financial discipline traces back to a moment that nearly ended his career before it began.In 2010, while at the University of Cincinnati, Kelce tested positive for marijuana and was suspended for the entire season. He lost his scholarship and was removed from the team. Reflecting on that period, Kelce later said, “I got kicked off the team.”The suspension forced Kelce into mandatory therapy and a full reset of his approach to football and life. It also triggered a position change to tight end full time, a move that unlocked his career.By his senior season in 2012, Kelce earned first-team All-Big East honors, setting the stage for his NFL entry. That early failure became the foundation for how he manages risk, money, and opportunity.Kelce’s business approach mirrors that lesson. He avoids reckless spending. He reinvests into longevity. His real estate choices emphasize privacy and appreciation. His lifestyle supports brand alignment rather than undermining it.Philanthropy is also structured. Through his Eighty-Seven & Running Foundation, Kelce funds education, mentoring, and community development initiatives in Cleveland and Kansas City. His contributions focus on sustained programs rather than one-time donations.Looking ahead, Kelce’s financial outlook remains strong regardless of retirement timing. His current contract runs through the 2025 season. His media ventures, equity positions, and endorsement appeal do not depend on weekly snap counts.Kelce acknowledged the physical toll of the NFL on the Jan. 6, 2026 episode of his “New Heights” podcast, saying, “There’s a lot of love for the game that’s still there and I don’t think I’ll ever lose that.” He also made clear that future decisions will be based on health and readiness, not financial necessity.Travis Kelce’s net worth did not come from fame. Fame amplified it. The wealth came from turning a near-career-ending mistake into structure, leverage, and ownership. That part of the story never changes.","According to Celebrity Net Worth, Travis Kelce’s net worth is estimated at $90 million as of 2025.

Lakers trade chatter shifts focus from Austin Reaves to Luka Doncic as the more valuable trade move

Online backlash erupts over Luka Doncic trade speculation

Fans tear into analysts after Luka Doncic trade mention (Image via: X)

Following the recent controversy surrounding Lakers’ shooting guard Austin Reaves’ trade from the franchise, a new debate has sparked, going far beyond Austin Reaves. What started as a hypothetical discussion has taken a turn to become one of the franchise’s most heated controversies involving Luka Doncic.Over the past few weeks, there have been talks about whether the team's core players could stay competitive long term. With maximum contracts coming up and the pressure to chase a championship, even star players like Luka Doncic are being considered for a trade. Max Kellerman’s recent comments have drawn attention from not just the fans but across the entire NBA.The controversy initially gained attention when Rich Paul suggested a hypothetical scenario involving a trade between Austin Reaves and Jaren Jackson Jr.on the “Game Over with Max Kellerman and Rich Paul” podcast. While Paul later clarified that the conversation was never meant to signify an actual trade plan, the damage was already done. Fans and analysts quickly started questioning whether the Lakers were trying to move Reaves from the franchise.Things took a turn when, instead of focusing on moving Reaves, Kellerman suggested that trading Luka Doncic could make more sense.He justified his statement, saying, “I like Austin Reaves a lot, as does Rich, by the way”, indicating that Luka’s trade value would bring a significantly larger return, “I can get x for Austin. I can get 3x for Luka”, Max added. Nonetheless, this idea shocked many, given Doncic’s status and role as a star player for any franchise lucky enough to have him.Fans have reacted with backlash and frustration towards the discussion around the Lakers, especially the idea of trading Doncic. One fan commented, “These guys don’t need a mike lol. I could do this job if I just get up there and say random stuff lol”. While another added, “Kellerman had a salary bonus by midget on his left and has become Kellerdumb”. “Lmfao. Full blown re***** these two. How about that LeBron guy who hasn’t played a l*** of defense in years?”, a fan added. While someone bluntly pointed out, “Yet another reason why Max should stick to boxing”. “Does every podcast have to be about the lakers? There’s 29 other teams do they talk about anyone else”, a fan commented over a clip if the podcast shared on X.Overall, these reactions suggest that fans see the bold take as absurd and attention-seeking rather than serious basketball analysis, which implies that the analysts are saying just to spark controversy and not because the idea makes any real sense.Also Read: Skip Bayless accuses LeBron James of trying to “push Austin Reaves out the back door”","Max Kellerman suggested that the Lakers should trade Luka Doncic instead of Austin Reaves.

Brady explains how family challenges clarified his decision to walk away

Tom Brady spent more than two decades creating an unprecedented legacy in the NFL with the Patriots. However, his final years in the field were filled with personal problems, which fueled his underperformance on the field. In a recent interview, Brady acknowledged that his divorce from Gisele Bündchen deeply affected his final season in the league.While appearing on The Herd, Brady was asked about Aaron Rodgers and the difficulty of knowing when to retire. Brady explained that his last season came during a period of emotional strain, and it affected his abilities as a player and took a toll on him mentally. He also reflected on how he had no regrets when he decided that it was time to tap out in 2023 after 23 seasons.During his appearance on the podcast, he admitted to the challenges at the time, saying, “My last season was tough. I was going through a lot of just a personal family issue, and it was a challenge, and it was a very… It just took a lot out of me in terms of my ability to continue to play.”Brady rarely spoke publicly about the personal side of his career while he was active. This time, however, he made it clear that the emotional weight off the field mattered as much as the physical demands on it.Further on, when discussing retirement, Brady emphasized that he felt no sense of regret and wanted to settle down as a family man with his kids. He also felt that he had achieved whatever he wanted out of the NFL by that point in his life.He stated, “I had 23 years of [football], so I didn’t think I was missing anything, retiring. I felt like I always had a goal — 45. I was 45 years old, I wanted to spend time with my kids.” That perspective helped him accept walking away after the 2022 season and fully stepping aside in 2023 following his time with the Buccaneers.Brady added that being present for his kids mattered more than chasing another comeback. He said, “I felt like, okay, now it’s time for me to be at all my kids’ games. They’ve been to enough of their dad’s games.” That shift in priorities explains why his final retirement felt permanent.Since the divorce, both Brady and Bündchen have moved forward with their lives. She remarried in 2025 and welcomed another child with Joaquim Valente, while Brady remains focused on his role at Fox Sports and raising his three children. Though he has been seen publicly with Alix Earle, he has stayed quiet about his personal life.Also read: Tom Brady breaks silence and makes his priorities clear amid rumors of a potential romance with Alix Earle",Tom Brady said his divorce from Gisele Bündchen affected his final season in the NFL.

The milestone represents something no Wayne Gretzky, Mark Messier, or Grant Fuhr ever accomplished in Edmonton.Nugent-Hopkins will become the first player to play 1,000 games wearing only an Oilers uniform from start to finish. The achievement carries added weight considering the era Nugent-Hopkins endured in Edmonton.Selected first overall in 2011, he arrived during what became known as the Decade of Darkness. High draft picks arrived with suffocating pressure and departed just as quickly when results didn't materialize. Taylor Hall was traded to New Jersey.Jordan Eberle went to the New York Islanders. Justin Schultz left as a free agent. Nail Yakupov flamed out and was dealt. Fresh faces showed up every year, and soon another was being shipped out in the opposite direction.Nugent-Hopkins admitted there were moments when he thought his turn would come. ""There were definitely moments where I thought I'd be getting the call,"" the 32-year-old said this week.""I was really good friends with Justin Schultz, and things went from really good to pretty sour pretty quickly for him here. Then Jordan, and Taylor, and a lot of other guys left too."" He paused before adding the obvious thought that crossed his mind during those years.""Yeah, there were moments when I thought I could be next on the block,"" he said. ""I'm sure there were offers."" Former teammate Sam Gagner believes Nugent-Hopkins's personality kept him in Edmonton when others were moved.""He's such a good teammate, such a low-maintenance guy,"" Gagner said. ""Maybe when you're looking for problems or looking for change, he's the last place you look?"" Current teammate Curtis Lazar explained what makes Nugent-Hopkins so valuable on the ice.""When he gets the puck, everyone on the bench just exhales,"" Lazar said. ""We know he'll do the right thing with it."" Darnell Nurse echoed that sentiment when describing his longtime teammate's impact. ""He's an exhale,"" Nurse said. ""I mean, you couldn't put it better.""Nugent-Hopkins was drafted ahead of Gabriel Landeskog, Jonathan Huberdeau, Mark Scheifele, and Nikita Kucherov in 2011. He ranks as the fourth-highest scorer from that draft class and will be the first to reach 1,000 games.He currently has 785 points and remains under contract through three more seasons at a $5.125 million cap hit. When his career concludes, Nugent-Hopkins will lead the franchise in games played wearing blue and orange, a fitting legacy for a player who survived Edmonton's darkest years to reach its brightest.","Nugent-Hopkins will become the first player to play 1,000 games wearing only an Oilers uniform from start to finish.

The Rasmus Andersson trade saga appears to be reaching its conclusion. The Athletic's Pierre LeBrun reported on Friday that talks have heated up significantly around the Calgary Flames defenseman, with multiple teams pushing to acquire the pending unrestricted free agent.Andersson played Thursday night in the Flames' 3-1 victory over Chicago, logging 26:55 of ice time in what could potentially be his final game in a Calgary uniform. The 29-year-old defenseman has been the subject of trade speculation dating back to last summer as he approaches free agency in July.""As others have noted, things have heated up on the Rasmus Andersson trade front,"" LeBrun tweeted earlier today. ""He wasn't held out of the lineup last night, but sense is talks have intensified. Let's see where it goes over the next 24-48 hours as to whether it gets done or not.”The Dallas Stars, Vegas Golden Knights, Toronto Maple Leafs, and Detroit Red Wings have all shown interest in acquiring the right-shot defenseman. The Golden Knights nearly completed a deal during the offseason, but negotiations ultimately fell apart. Ottawa has also expressed interest, though reports indicate the Senators are on Andersson's six-team no-trade list.Calgary general manager Craig Conroy has reportedly set a steep asking price for his top defenseman. The Flames are seeking the equivalent of two first-round picks, including a 2026 first-rounder and either an NHL-ready defenseman or a top prospect close to making the jump.Andersson has posted 10 goals and 29 points in 47 games this season while averaging a team-high 24:12 of ice time. He quarterbacks the power play and remains one of the most valuable right-shot defensemen available on the trade market at a manageable $4.55 million cap hit.The Flames sit at 20-23-4 and have dropped five of their last six games, firmly positioning themselves as sellers ahead of the trade deadline. Calgary already owns two first-round picks in 2026 from the Noah Hanifin trade to Vegas and could add another through an Andersson deal.The timing becomes critical with the Olympics approaching next month. Andersson will captain Sweden after leading them to bronze at last spring's World Hockey Championship.

Colorado Avalanche goaltender Mackenzie Blackwood has returned to the club for the first time after sustaining an injury. He is all set to face the Nashville Predators on Friday at Ball Arena. As per reports, the goaltender has missed six games due to a lower-body injury but was activated off injured reserve on Wednesday and cleared to play.Earlier, Blackwood played in Colorado’s last game on Wednesday, stopping 12 of 13 shots against the St. Louis Blues in a 6-1 victory to improve to 13-1-1 on the season. However, Blackwood did not participate, although there was no word after the skate about him being hurt. Let’s take a closer look at the Avalanche goaltender's return to the team. Colorado Avalanche goaltender Mackenzie Blackwood is slated to defend the home crease against the Predators on Friday, Evan Rawal of the Denver Gazette reports. As per reports, Blackwood missed the last six games due to a lower-body injury, but he was activated off injured reserve on Wednesday and has been officially cleared to return two days later.Earlier, the Avalanche placed Mackenzie Blackwood on injured reserve on Friday as the team prepares to head east for a three-game road trip.The 29-year-old has been stellar for the Avalanche when healthy this year, going 13-1-1 with a 2.07 GAA and .924 save percentage over 15 appearances.The Avalanche goaltender is playing its first game since New Year’s Eve. He needed time to recover from a precautionary injury the team didn’t want to let worsen. Their dominant record allows them to take this route.Meanwhile, the Avalanche are 3-2-1 in their last six games, dating back to when Devon Toews and Gabe Landeskog were injured. They played six games in 10 nights but have since had the last three days off. The Avs will also have the weekend off before their next game, which is scheduled for this upcoming Monday.As for the match schedule, Colorado will be seen playing in Carolina on Saturday, Florida on Sunday, and Tampa Bay on Tuesday. Without Blackwood available for any of these games, they might be inclined to utilize Scott Wedgewood more than initially anticipated.","Colorado Avalanche goaltender Mackenzie Blackwood has returned to the club for the first time after sustaining an injury.

The biggest MMA talking points that shaped Thursday’s conversation



Mid-January is usually a quiet stretch on the UFC calendar, a short pause before the action picks up pace again. But Thursday, January 15, 2026, was different. Injury news, title questions, and suspensions kept the MMA world buzzing and fans scrolling late into the night, including the announcement of a lengthy ban for Mohammed Usman following a failed drug test.From major fight plans being scrapped to unexpected developments around championship belts, the news cycle reminded everyone how fast things can change in mixed martial arts. Even without a fight night attached, the storylines carried real weight for what lies ahead over the next few months.One of the most serious updates of the day came away from the cage. Mohammed Usman was handed a 30-month suspension after failing an out of competition drug test for testosterone and misleading investigators until evidence was presented.The ban will keep him sidelined until April 9, 2028, effectively putting his fighting career on pause for more than two years and sending a clear message about enforcement.From there, the conversation quickly shifted back to the sport’s biggest names and biggest business decisions. The headline item centered on UFC CEO Dana White, who made it clear he is no longer pushing for a long-discussed showdown between Conor McGregor and Michael Chandler.Once seen as a guaranteed blockbuster, the matchup now appears firmly off the table, leaving fans split on whether the fight still matters or if the moment has simply passed.Injury news also made its way into the mix. UFC 325 lost a main card bout after a fighter suffered a ruptured ACL, continuing a frustrating pattern of late card changes. It is another reminder of how quickly fight cards can change, even deep into training camps, and why fans have grown cautious about getting too attached to matchups too early.At the championship level, UFC officials addressed growing questions around the lightweight division. The promotion does not plan to strip champion Ilia Topuria, despite his current situation. Instead, internal discussions have focused on the possibility of an interim title defense involving either Paddy Pimblett or Justin Gaethje, who are set to face each other at UFC 324. That idea alone adds more intrigue to a division that already has no shortage of contenders waiting their turn.Elsewhere, Arman Tsarukyan opened up about his finances, Alex Pereira was spotted sparring a heavyweight in Brazil, and Georges St Pierre reminded everyone why he still commands respect. Kamaru Usman admitted regret over sharing a private video chat with Anthony Joshua, while lighter moments ranged from wild knockout clips to viral training footage and social media oddities.By the end of the night, one thing was clear. Even without a live event, the MMA world rarely slows down. With UFC 324 just a week away and major decisions looming at the top of the sport, Thursday felt less like filler and more like a preview of chaos still to come.",The UFC announced a 30-month suspension for Mohammed Usman after a failed drug test.
