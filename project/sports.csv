He has been toiling for many years in his quest to compete at the Olympics, having played in all other top global competitions.Desai's experience and dedication were evident as he breezed through his preliminary match.In boxing, 20-year-old Preeti from Haryana was unimpressive in the first round as her Vietnamese opponent dictated the proceedings.

However, Moutet clawed back into the match, eventually securing the win. This match continued a trend, as three of their last four encounters have gone to three sets. Moutet's tactics, including underarm serves and drop shots, as well as the home crowd's support, were instrumental in his victory.In the men's doubles, Rohan Bopanna and N Sriram Balaji faced Edouard Roger-Vasselin and Gael Monfils . The French pair won 5-7, 2-6. This match is expected to be Bopanna's last representation of India in a multi-sport event, as the 44-year-old has announced his retirement from Davis Cup .Monfils, replacing the injured Fabien Reboul, used powerful hitting and the energy from the home crowd to their advantage. The French strategy involved engaging Bopanna in long rallies, which sidelined Balaji and limited his chances for fast plays at the net.The Indian team did manage to break Roger-Vasselin's serve but couldn't keep the momentum, ending the match with an unforced error.

A total of 85 boats carried nearly 7,000 athletes from 205 countries along the river. The Olympic flag was carried into Trocadero by Floriane Issert, a cloaked rider who had earlier galloped down the Seine on a metal horse draped in a cape adorned with the Olympic rings. Issert concluded her ride at the closing point of the ceremony before handing over the flag to be hoisted, as per tradition, The Independent reported.The 'Parade of Nations', which usually features sportspersons walking on the running track of a stadium, witnessed a break from tradition as athletes from 205 countries and one refugee team navigated the Seine on boats, which mesmerised the audience.Despite the looming threat of heavy rain before and during the ceremony, the participants remained undeterred, showcasing their resilience and determination.The ceremony also gave a sweet nod to 'Hindi' as it was among the six languages used in infographics to pay tribute to the contribution of prominent French women during the segment titled 'sisterhood'.The Indian contingent, consisting of 78 athletes and officials, made their entrance at the 84th position during the event. The contingent was led by flag-bearers PV Sindhu, two-time Olympic medallist; and A Sharath Kamal, a legendary table tennis player.The ceremony concluded with a sparkling performance by Celine Dion, who lit up the drenched Paris streets. French Olympic gold medalists Marie-Jose Perec and Teddy Riner had the honor of lighting the Paris 2024 Olympic cauldron, which will burn throughout the duration of the Games. A stunning laser show illuminated the Eiffel Tower, attempting to pierce through the gloomy skies over Paris.The show, produced by director Thomas Jolly, included appearances by Lady Gaga, Zinedine Zidane, and even The Minions. Celine Dion's return to the stage was a highlight, especially considering her recent diagnosis of stiff-person syndrome, a rare neurological disorder that causes muscle spasms and rigidity. The condition had led the multiple Grammy winner to cancel her tour dates for 2023 and 2024.","The iconic emblem, featuring five colored rings, appeared to be hoisted incorrectly, with the rings in the wrong positions.

CHATEAUROUX: Three years ago at Tokyo Olympics , Manu Bhaker , then 19, had tears in her eyes. Burdened with great expectations, she failed to make the finals. She was bogged down by the hype of being the prodigy who would rule the world of shooting . Defeat left her broken. But she healed fast and has returned to show why she will be on top for a while.On Sunday, Manu, now 22, shot like a pro, like she has been for months now.No nerves, no excuses, no meltdown. She was in the zone, making history by becoming the first Indian woman shooter to win an Olympic medal — a bronze in 10m air pistol. The gold and silver went to South Korea.“It was very intense. The pressure was immense, but Manu was very brave. Really proud of her,” her personal coach Jaspal Rana said.It wasn’t the smoothest ride for Manu leading up to Paris: she had not won an Olympic quota in this discipline. However, she performed brilliantly in the trials and was picked for 10m air pistol, apart from the 25m air pistol event.As soon as the bronze was confirmed, coach Rana, sitting in the press tribune, walked out satisfied, smiling. Manu said later: “This is because of the hard work we put in. This medal is a result of our blood and sweat and dedicated to my nation. I had figured out where he was sitting – inside the shooting range – and kept making eye contact with him. It gave me the courage to fight on every shot.”Jaspal, himself a former champion pistol shooter, has played a huge role in helping Manu forget her bitter past, made her mentally tougher and worked hard on her technique. All the hard work paid off.At the medal ceremony, Manu was beaming, secure in the fact that she would not return home with a bag full of shattered dreams. Happy that all the hard work put in after the Tokyo debacle had paid off.Manu had been in good form when she shot in the mixed event on Saturday. She was getting the 10s consistently. She started the final with a 10.6 and followed it up with a 10.2. She had made her intentions clear.In the first series, she had two 9s – 9.5 and 9.6. Still, she was third and very much in medal hunt. After the second series, in which she had two 9.6 shots, she was still third with 100.3 points, just behind the two South Koreans who finally finished one-two.The gold went to Oh Ye Jin and the silver was won by Kim Yeji.Manu had a fascinating battle with Yeji when the elimination round started. The Indian, who was in the third position, jumped to second with a 10.5 and a 10.4. The Korean had shot 10 and 10.3. The battle for the silver medal had intensified. It was also clear by then that Manu would go on to win a medal unless she succumbed to nerves.Manu slipped to the third position after three straight 9s – 9.8, 9.8, 9.9. But she recovered with seven straight 10-plus shots. And when the last two shots to decide the bronze medallist came, Manu had edged ahead of Yeji by 0.1 point. But Manu shot a 10.3 while Yeji scored 10.5, going 0.1 ahead to secure the silver.“It was so close. Yes, 0.1 point, but it happens at this level. I am happy that I could start the medal hunt for the country,” she said.“It was very intense; I am happy Manu fought the way she did. The pressure was immense, but she was very brave. Really proud of her,” Rana said.Manu has two more competitions to go – 10m air pistol mixed team event and 25m pistol event.“Ï have no time to celebrate or reflect on what happened at the shooting range today. I will be back at the range tomorrow and then a few days later. I have work to do. I want more,” she said.

India has not played cricket in Pakistan for over a decade, and it is uncertain if this will change soon.The debate has drawn various comments from former cricketers from both nations.Harbhajan Singh , a former Indian spinner, voiced concerns about India's potential visit to Pakistan, citing the volatile security situation.On the other hand, ex-Pakistan pacer Tanvir Ahmed has openly challenged the Indian team to visit Pakistan, referring to Pakistan's own visit to India for the ODI World Cup last year.A video clip featuring Tanvir Ahmed has gone viral on social media wherein he commends the Pakistan team for being ""brave and fearless"" for traveling to India to play cricket. In the clip, he extends an invitation to the Indian team to come to Pakistan, reassuring them of their safety.""Sher hai hum log sher hai, hum log sher hai. Hum log tere mulk me aa ke khel ke gaye hai. Aake dikha....Hum toh kah rahe hai aake khelo. Security denge, sab kuch denge tum logon ko. Aa toh sahi ek dafaa [We are lions, we are lions. We came and played cricket in your country. Come here and show... We are inviting you to come and play. We will provide security, we will give you everything.

Chahe jeete, chahe haare, jis tarah ki cricket khele. Woh India jaake khelke wapas aaye the. Isko kahte hai ek daler team aur daler players [It's only the Pakistan players who do this. Only Pakistani players come and play and go back, regardless of winning or losing, and no matter how they play. They went to India and returned after playing there. This is what you call a brave team and brave players],"" he added.Pakistan has assured that all matches involving the Indian team in the tournament will be held in Lahore, and the Indian team will stay at the same hotel throughout their visit. The idea behind this arrangement is to implement more effective and secure measures.Last year, the Indian cricket team refused to travel to Pakistan for the Asia Cup , leading to India matches being staged in Sri Lanka instead. Since 2012, the two nations have not played any bilateral series, with the Indian government limiting cricket encounters between Pakistan and India to ICC or ACC events.","India has not played cricket in Pakistan for over a decade, and it is uncertain if this will change soon.

NEW DELHI: Ravichandran Ashwin found himself at the center of a humorous incident during a TNPL 2024 match between the Nellai Royal Kings and the Dindigul Dragons on Sunday.During the 15th over of the Dindigul Dragons' innings, bowler Mohan Prasath gave Ashwin a warning for leaving the non-striker's end too early. In a move that amused both spectators and commentators, Ashwin had actually kept his bat grounded in the crease until the very last moment.The light-hearted nature of the incident was evident, as the commentators couldn't contain their laughter during the on-air commentary.Star Sports shared a video of the incident on social media with a caption in the local language, which translated to, 'Ash Anna be like: Headmaster of the school you studied in!'Mankading, a method of dismissal where the bowler runs out the non-striker for backing up too far, gained significant attention when Ashwin dismissed Jos Buttler in the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2019. Since then, Ashwin has been a vocal supporter of the legality and fairness of this mode of dismissal, arguing that it adheres to the rules of cricket.Ashwin's stance and actions continue to spark debate and highlight the importance of adhering to the laws of the game.","Ravichandran Ashwin was given a warning for leaving the non-striker's end too early.

NEW DELHI: Manu Bhaker clinched a historic bronze in shooting as Indian women athletes dazzled in an account-opening performance the second day of the Paris Olympics on Sunday.While Bhaker claimed her maiden medal at the Games, two-time Olympic medallist PV Sindhu and debutant Nikhat Zareen showed promise for future podium finishes.Bhaker, now 22, clinched the bronze in women's 10m air pistol at Chateauroux's National Shooting Centre, becoming the first Indian female shooter to win an Olympic medal.Her accomplishment was especially notable as it marked the end of India's 12-year medal drought in Olympic shooting -- a sport where the nation had high expectations but no successes in the last two editions.""In Bhagwat Gita, Krishna says to Arjuna that 'you focus on your karma and not on the outcome of that karma'. Only that was running in my head,"" news agency PTI quoted Bhaker as saying, with relief written large on her smiling face, when asked about her state of mind during the final.The achievement places India at the joint 18th spot in the overall standings alongside South Africa, Hungary, and Spain.Bhaker’s medal opened India's account in the ongoing Games, supported by the guidance of her long-time coach Jaspal Rana.The bronze win by Bhaker was a redemption of sorts for her, coming three years after her weapon malfunctioned during the qualification round of the same event in Tokyo, leaving her disheartened. This time, her score of 221.7 in the final stood out.Adding to the optimism, Indian shooters Ramita Jindal and Arjun Babuta both entered the finals of the 10m air rifle events in their respective categories, promising further successes for India in shooting at these Games.Sindhu and HS Prannoy clinched straight-game wins in their opening group stage matches at the Paris Olympics.Sindhu, in pursuit of her third successive Olympic medal, defeated Maldives' Fathimath Abdul Razzaq while Prannoy overcame Germany's Fabian Roth, marking a strong start.Sindhu showcased her class by defeating Razzaq 21-9, 21-6 in just 29 minutes in the women's singles Group M match. The 29-year-old, coached by the legendary Prakash Padukone, highlighted the role of 'yoga' in maintaining her mental strength.""It is very important to be mentally strong. You at times don't know what is happening...I have tried to be positive, I keep myself calm and do yoga,"" she said.Prannoy, a debutant at Olympics, secured victory against Roth with a score of 21-18, 21-12 in a 45-minute Group K match. The 32-year-old from Kerala, who had recently recovered from chikungunya, demonstrated his fitness and skill. He will compete against Le Duc Phat of Vietnam on Wednesday in the second and final group match.While Sindhu showcased dominance on the badminton court, boxer Zareen exhibited tenacity in her 50kg category opener in Paris.The 28-year-old Hyderabadi advanced to the pre-quarterfinals, defeating Germany's Maxi Carina Kloetzer.On Thursday, Zareen faces her next challenge, top-seeded Asian Games and reigning flyweight world champion Wu Yu of China, who had a first-round bye.Manika Batra , 29, secured a win over Great Britain's Anna Hursey in the round of 64 women's singles table tennis match with scores of 11-8, 12-10, 11-9, 9-11, and 11-5, matching her Tokyo Olympics performance.Joining her in the round of 32 is India's top-ranked woman player Sreeja Akula, who defeated Sweden's Christina Kallberg 4-0. Sreeja, who made history as the first Indian to win a WTT Contender singles title, secured a seamless victory with scores of 11-4, 11-9, 11-7, and 11-8 against Kallberg.In contrast, 42-year-old A Sharath Kamal , in his fifth Olympic appearance, experienced a defeat in a 2-4 match against Slovenia's Deni Kozul, who is ranked 86 places below him.Kamal's match ended in scores of 12-10, 9-11, 6-11, 7-11, 11-8, and 10-12. Kamal however will continue to be in contention in the team event, which will start later.Harmeet Desai also suffered a 0-4 loss against world no.5 Felix Lebrun of France in the second round of the men's singles table tennis competition, ending his maiden Olympic campaign.The 31-year-old from Surat couldn't settle into a rhythm to go down 8-11, 8-11, 6-11, 8-11 against the 17-year-old local hopeful in 28 minutes, which brought the curtains down on India's campaign in men's singles competitions.The Indian women's archery team, featuring former world no.1 Deepika Kumari and debutants Ankita Bhakat and Bhajan Kaur, faced a tough quarterfinal loss to the Netherlands, going down 0-6.On the same day, at the Roland Garros, Sumit Nagal exited in the first round after a challenging match against Frenchman Corentin Moutetin.In the archery quarterfinals, 18-year-old Bhajan Kaur delivered an impressive performance, scoring 56 out of 60 points. However, her teammates Deepika Kumari and Ankita Bhakat struggled to keep up.Deepika managed a total of 48 points, while Ankita scored 46 out of a maximum of 60, including a disappointing shot into the 4-ring. The final scores for the match stood at 0-6 (51-52, 49-54, 48-53).Nagal's effort at Roland Garros ended with 2-6, 6-4, 5-7 defeat. His match lasted two hours and 28 minutes.Balraj Panwar progressed to the quarterfinals of the men's single sculls rowing competition after finishing second in Repechage 2.Panwar clocked 7 minutes 12.41 seconds to finish behind Monaco's Quentin Antognelli who clocked 7:10:00.

Shaw debuted for India in 2018 at the age of 18, marking his arrival with a century.He went on to play his first One Day International (ODI) in 2020 and his first Twenty20 International (T20I) in 2021. Despite a promising start, Shaw struggled to maintain his form, with his last appearance for India dating back to July 2021.During the IPL 2024 season, Shaw found himself out of the Delhi Capitals' playing eleven. Ponting recently expressed his views on Shaw's situation.""I mean to start with I don't like talking about individual players, but Prithvi shouldn't be an outlier. He should be someone that's in every team; the first pick in most teams with the skill that he's got. He's had a chance to represent India as a youngster, making a hundred on his Test debut,"" Ponting told Cricbuzz.""And as you say, halfway through this year, we couldn't find a slot for him in our DC team. So that's disappointing for me as a coach not to be able to make certain players better and get the best out of them. But sometimes there's only so much you can give and so many times you can try,"" he added.Ponting revealed that he had multiple discussions with Shaw in an effort to improve his cricketing skills. Despite these efforts, he acknowledged a limit to the impact a coach can have, saying, ""When you feel like you're not making players better and they're not doing what you need for the team, then you've got to look for other players that can do it for you. So that then comes back to the player. With him in particular I've had a lot of chats with him, a lot of conversations to try and make him a better cricketer.""""I mean, he's still a young man. And he's still a very talented young player. And hopefully one day the penny really drops for him and he works out what he needs to do to be the best cricketer that he can be,"" the former Australia captain explained.As the Delhi Capitals begin preparations for the IPL 2025 season , speculation about Shaw's future with the team has arisen.

One-off Test: McBrine shines as Ireland beat Zimbabwe by four wickets,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/one-off-test-mcbrine-shines-as-ireland-beat-zimbabwe-by-four-wickets/articleshow/112089054.cms,"NEW DELHI: Andy McBrine showcased his all-round skills, leading Ireland to a thrilling four-wicket victory over Zimbabwe in a one-off Test match in Belfast on Sunday. The win came despite a remarkable collapse of Ireland's top order.Chasing a modest target of 158 runs with the picturesque Stormont Castle in the background, Ireland found themselves in a precarious position at 33-5 by the end of the third day's play on Saturday, AFP reported.The damage was primarily inflicted by Zimbabwe's left-arm fast bowler Richard Ngarava , who claimed an impressive 4-12 in a mere four overs.However, on Sunday, in this historic Test match - the first-ever played in Northern Ireland - the Irish team displayed resilience, losing only one additional wicket as they successfully chased down the target.Lorcan Tucker, who scored 56 runs, and McBrine, who remained unbeaten at 55, formed a crucial partnership that changed the course of the match after Ireland had suffered a dramatic collapse, losing five wickets for just 21 runs.The duo's sixth-wicket stand yielded 96 runs, bringing Ireland closer to their target. However, Tucker's innings came to an end when he chopped a delivery from Blessing Muzarabani back onto his stumps, with Ireland still requiring 41 runs to secure the victory.Mark Adair, born in nearby Holywood, quickly settled in, making 24 not out and hitting the winning boundary as Ireland reached 158-6, securing victory with more than a day to spare.Off-spinner McBrine, 31, was named player of the match after taking a combined 7-75 across Zimbabwe's two innings.""McBrine is the guy you want to put in your cricket bag and take everywhere. Exceptionally skilful and deserved the award today,"" said Ireland captain Andy Balbirnie.The victory gave Ireland their first home win in the format, following their first seven Test defeats. This marked back-to-back successes, coming after their first Test win against Afghanistan in March.""We did believe last night,"" said Balbirnie.""We had our two best batters out (there). That partnership was special. It was fitting for Mark, hometown boy, to get us over the line.""Stormont became the second Test venue in Ireland after Malahide and the 123rd in the history of Test cricket.""Probably didn't think growing up that there'd be a Test here,"" said McBrine, who comes from the Northern Ireland village of Donemana.""We tried to be as positive as we can.""McBrine said he had been ""working hard behind the scenes"" on his bowling before paying tribute to Ireland's quicks.""It was not an easy wicket to bowl on but the way they rotated allowed me to take wickets as well.""Zimbabwe captain Craig Ervine was left thinking of what might have been had they been able to continue on Saturday night when Ireland were on the ropes at 33-5.""We'd have liked five, six more overs last night,"" he said.

They overcame the challenges put forth by Sri Lankan bowlers Maheesh Theekshana and Wanindu Hasaranga using sweep shots and quick decisions.The strategy was to not allow Theekshana and Wanindu Hasaranga's deliveries to deviate off the surface and create confusion. the India batters used their reach to good effect and smother the turn.In their brief innings, Jaiswal and Suryakumar hit seven boundaries and three sixes, adding 39 runs in just over three overs. Their quick runs made it easier for Hardik Pandya (22 not out off 9 balls) and Rishabh Pant (2 not out) to finish the match in 6.3 overs.Earlier, captain Suryakumar had a successful day with his bowlers.Sri Lanka, who were at 130 for 2 in 15 overs, collapsed, losing seven wickets for just 31 runs in their last 30 balls.

However, the following batsmen could not capitalize, and the Indian bowlers tightened their grip on the match.Dasun Shanaka and Hasaranga got out for zero, which reflected the mounting pressure and their hasty shot selection.The Indian bowling plans demonstrated effective coordination between Suryakumar and coach Gambhir. Bishnoi, who struggled initially against Sri Lanka's top-order, showed significant improvement.Bishnoi began his spell effectively after Riyan Parag (0/30 in 4 overs) and Axar Patel (2/30 in 4 overs) had held things steady. Bishnoi adjusted the pace of his googlies, which proved to be a game-changer.The ball gripped off the surface while travelling at a decent pace leaving batters confused whether to come forward or stay put on their stance.Once Bishnoi came in, the change he made from the previous night of varying the pace of his googlies -- fastest for Nissanka, slightly slower for Shanaka and flat and low for Hasaranga – was quite effective.India's comprehensive performance in both batting and bowling has left the final match of the series on Tuesday inconsequential.",India secure unassailable 2-0 lead in three-match T20I series against Sri Lanka.

I know that he is a bowlers' captain. He gives you a free hand (in a way) that you decide first,"" Axar was quoted as saying by PTI. ""Whenever you get hit, he comes and says that it was a good ball. He keeps giving you inputs. As a player, there is a good bond with him.""Axar recalled the five-match T20I series against Australia in India late last year, which India won 4-1, noting Yadav's consistent leadership style.

, India has a left-handed, toporder batsman in the aggressive mould just like you. What’s your take on him?

You were a pioneer in terms of aggressive batting at the top of the order. How would you’ve countered a bowler like Jasprit Bumrah, who seems to get the better of every batsman in contemporary cricket?

Sri Lanka too is known to produce unique bowlers. How do they to retain their uniqueness, considering there is a tendency among coaches at different levels to coach a talent too much?

NEW DELHI: With the Olympics going on the India-Sri Lanka limited-overs series has hardly raised the fervour among fans. Sanath Jayasuriya , the interim head coach of Sri Lanka, however, believes the series holds “massive importance” for young players from both sides.The Lankan leg -end spoke to TOI exclusively.In the T20 World Cup, our batters were getting starts but weren’t able to convert the starts into big scores. There were some little things missing. The players also know that. Batters need to fire and fire big to win a match. We have a good bowling side which can win us games.Jaiswal is another great talent from India. He has the passion to do well, and to do that he has been working very hard. He has made sacrifices and is a dedicated kid, that’s why he is performing. I have heard about his work ethic, and that’s quite impressive. Recently, we had a session with Zubin (Bharucha), the director of high performance at Rajasthan Royals , and he told us how hard Jaiswal trains.He (Bumrah) is unique. We need to re -spect him and his skills. On his day, you’ll need to respect him, but then there are days when he is not up to the mark, it’s on those days you need to capitalise. Bowlers like him are on top because they’ve clear thinking in what they want to execute.We always tell the bowlers to keep their natural way of bowling. We don’t change much, but we make sure that they learn from their mistakes. Pathi -rana, for example, has also learnt a lot while playing for Chennai in the IPL. He has improved a lot under (MS) Dhoni’s captaincy.

India didn't face much trouble in beating hosts Sri Lanka in the first T20I international in Pallekele on Saturday once their batsmen had put the home team under pressure with a total in excess of 200, but Ashish Nehra 's witty observation after the match left opener Yashasvi Jaiswal speechless.Led by skipper Suryakumar Yadav's half-century (58 off 26 balls), India's top-order fired all cylinders to take the team to a commanding 213 for 7 after the Lankan skipper Charith Asalanka won the toss and put the visitors in to bat.Jaiswal (40 off 21 balls) and Shubman Gill (34 off 16 balls) gave India a dominating start of 74 runs before both fell on consecutive deliveries. Surya and Rishabh Pant (49 off 33 balls) then entertained the crowd with a stroke-filled 76-run partnership, which was enough to push India past the 200-run mark despite the middle-order faltering.Talking to Jaiswal after the match, former India pacer Ashish Nehra stumped the young batsman with his comment and he could only smile about that with a you-caught-me expression.""Ajay Jadeja asked you what's the difference when Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma were there (to open in T20Is). According to me, there is just one difference. If Virat and Rohit were still playing this format, then whatever strokes we saw from you today, you would have played those in the nets. Now you are getting to play those shots in the match because they (Virat and Rohit) are not there,"" quipped Nehra.Both Virat and Rohit had announced their T20I retirement after India won the T20 World Cup last month.Nehra's cheeky comment left everyone in splits and the video clip of the small interaction was shared by Sony Sports Network on X (formerly Twitter).Coming back to the match, Sri Lanka started their stiff run-chase on a positive note, as their openers Pathum Nissanka and Kusal Mendis added 84 runs in 8.3 overs. Arshdeep Singh (2 for 24) broke that stand by dismissing Mendis (45 off 27 balls).

Hardik Pandya: Ex-New Zealand cricketer agrees with Team India's call to not make Hardik Pandya captain,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-in-sri-lanka/will-hardik-pandya-become-india-captain-again-ex-new-zealand-cricketer-advises-the-all-rounder-to-concentrate-on-his-skills/articleshow/112073524.cms,"Top Picks For You 1st T20I: Suryakumar Yadav-Gautam Gambhir regime starts with 43-run win against Sri Lanka

NEW DELHI: The likelihood of Hardik Pandya serving as India's captain in the near future appears slim, according to former New Zealand all-rounder Scott Styris . Styris supports Indian team management's decision to avoid appointing Pandya as captain due to concerns about the added pressures and responsibilities that could affect his performance and fitness.""I wouldn't have personally made Hardik Pandya my captain either.I think that's a smart choice solely for one reason, and that is as an all-rounder. Skills-wise, he is India's best all-rounder. He is phenomenal. But you want him to be consistently fit,"" Styris told News18.Pandya's recurrent injuries and the physical demands of bowling are factors contributing to Styris' assessment.""At the moment, how he's in and out with his injuries, you know, bowling is really hard. It takes a lot out of you and your body. So sometimes, adding all the responsibility of captaincy is not necessarily a good thing because there's just too much to do. I'd love to see Hardik Pandya just concentrate on getting those skills right, batting and bowling. And then you can look at captaincy a little bit later,"" explained Styris.Styris also emphasized the significant role Pandya plays as a bowler, especially in light of fitness concerns surrounding key pacers like Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Shami . Pandya's presence as a sixth bowler can be invaluable for the team.""These fast bowling stocks are the one area where India probably needs a little bit more help, which is why I like the selection of these youngsters. Anytime Bumrah is not here, your team is going to be weaker. He's as good as anyone who's ever played the game, especially the white ball. So the decision to give him a rest, you totally understand. You've got to make sure that he's fresh and ready for some of the other challenges that India have in front of them,"" Styris added.""You want more out of Hardik Pandya. That's why I like the decision not to make him captain because I really want to see him stand up with a dominant role with the ball more than anything,"" he concluded.The consensus among experts like Styris appears to be that Hardik Pandya should focus on his all-rounder capabilities and maintaining fitness. This would allow him to contribute effectively without the added burden of captaincy.","Former New Zealand all-rounder Scott Styris says Hardik Pandya should focus on his skills and fitness instead of captaincy.

Will support national team by developing players at Inter Kashi: Habas,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/will-support-national-team-by-developing-players-at-inter-kashi-habas/articleshow/112029904.cms,"Last season, Habas guided Mohun Bagan Super Giant to the ISL Shield triumph

Panaji:

Antonio Lopez Habas was close to becoming the national team coach until he was pipped at the post by FC Goa ’s Manolo Marquez , who will now do a dual job of coaching club and country.Habas remains the most successful coach in the Indian Super League (ISL), the top-tier league in the country, and believed he had more than a decent chance of stepping into the boots of Igor Stimac, sacked last month for his failure to steer India to the third round of the FIFA World Cup 2026 qualifiers.“I think I deserved the nomination (to coach the national team),” Habas told TOI after completing a surprise move to Inter Kashi in the I-League , Indian football’s second tier, on Thursday. “We won three (ISL) titles, played four finals and six semifinals. Within football (fraternity), I feel like another Indian. I have coached many players of the national team. I was not chosen, and I accept it. I will support the national team by developing players at Inter Kashi. It’s what I have done until now, and what I will continue to do.”Last season, Habas guided Mohun Bagan Super Giant to the ISL Shield triumph. But while title victories normally assure coaches of a contract extension, the experienced Spaniard was not considered, reportedly due to concerns over his health. Even while selecting the national coach, the All India Football Federation (AIFF) executive committee members made a mention of the 67-year-old’s age and health.Habas though said he has the same “strength and enthusiasm” as when he first arrived in India to take charge of Atletico de Kolkata and won the maiden ISL trophy in 2014.“I am very disappointed and saddened by the treatment that some journalists and others have given me, speaking about my health problems. Someone did it to justify my departure from Mohun Bagan, and at the same time, prevent me from training the national team. My medical tests are currently perfect,” said Habas.The serial trophy winner has won the ISL twice with ATK (2014, 2019-20) and the ISL Winner’s Shield with Mohun Bagan last season. Now, his focus is on ensuring that Inter Kashi – started last season – win the I-League and move to the ISL.Explaining his decision to take over Inter Kashi, Habas said the club’s “proposal is attractive, serious and ambitious.”“It offers me guarantees and seriousness to develop my work,” he said. “At the same time, it is a great responsibility to be able to have a great impact sportingly in such an important and fascinating region of India as Uttar Pradesh.”Besides winning trophies in India, Habas had a stint as Bolivia’s head coach and finished runner-up in the 1997 Copa America.Inter Kashi said Habas will spearhead a long-term project aimed at creating a sustainable football ecosystem in Uttar Pradesh. “This initiative will focus on the promotion of Inter Kashi to the ISL, ensuring the club competes at the highest level of Indian football.“Habas will also help Inter Kashi devise a concrete player pathway to Europe, collaborating with Inter Escaldes to establish a pathway for Indian players to gain opportunities in Andorra, providing them with invaluable international exposure and experience,” the club said in a statement on Thursday.","Antonio Lopez Habas was close to becoming the national team coach until he was pipped at the post by FC Goa’s Manolo Marquez.

Five first-team players – Samik Mitra, Bikash Yumnam, Vincy Barretto, Alexander Romario and Irfan Yadwad – have been included in the camp. What is the plan for them?

What do you make of the youngsters in the squad?

How has the preparation been so far?

Coyle is well known for his positive brand of football. Will the reserve team have a similar style of play going forward?

You have reunited with Coyle, after having worked at Jamshedpur FC. How does it feel?

CHENNAI: Chennaiyin FC ’s newly appointed assistant coach Noel Wilson said the club opted to play with the reserve team in the Durand Cup to ensure that the first-team gets a six-week pre-season ahead of the Indian Super League (ISL). In an interaction with TOI at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium – Chennaiyin’s current training base – Wilson spoke about head coach Owen Coyle’s plan for the main team, Durand Cup preparation and more.Excerpts:You (first team) need to have a six-week pre-season (ahead of the ISL), which is about one-and-a-half months. I think, after the Durand Cup, there is going to be a gap of two months. You cannot be stagnant in that period. Coyle will have better ideas. He does not want the main team to play in the Durand Cup as there are chances of players getting injured. Maybe he does not want to take risk with the main-team players. He knows what is right.The players who have come here did not get much game time last season. When you play competitive matches, your confidence level will increase. After playing here, they will perform better once they return to the main team.There are some young players who have good quality. They need the experience and exposure of playing with the bigger guys (seniors). The difference between playing in a reserve team and a senior team is huge. But I can see that there is potential.Besides players from the main and reserve teams, we have shortlisted a few players from the trials. The team is good; the young boys are working hard. No matter what the team is (opponent), you will win if you play well. That is what I believe in. I have asked the boys not to worry about the opponents, whether they are from the ISL or I-League.It is difficult to implement a style of play when you have only a month to prepare. We began training at the start of the month and our first match is on July 31. But in general, I like it when the boys keep the ball in the front (attacking areas). I do not want the boys to keep the ball at the back for a long time. I do not want them to do that because it might create problems; errors at the back could lead to goals. I would rather expect the players to take the ball forward and play in the opponent’s half. That will be safer for us.Coyle is a wonderful coach; we can see it in his personality and coaching. Last season, he got Chennaiyin to the playoffs. It is always good to work with good coaches.

But I was not able to feel myself comfortable enough during the whole week to be satisfied with the week of tennis that I played.""",Rafael Nadal has set his sights on a third gold medal at the Paris Olympics.
