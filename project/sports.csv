‘Kochi Biennale challenges the practice of putting certain artists on a pedestal’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kochi-biennale-challenges-the-practice-of-putting-certain-artists-on-a-pedestal/articleshow/126100494.cms,"Nikhil Chopra

You were one of the OGs of

performance art

in India, back when it wasn’t even widely accepted as art. You’ve done things like eating and sleeping at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York to trace the legacy of colonialism. As curator, the Biennale feels like it’s part of your attempt to expand the definition of art. Was that your aim?

Your curatorial team at HH Art Spaces brought together established artists like Marina Abramovic and our own Gulammohammed Sheikh alongside artists who don’t even have gallery representation. That’s unusual, isn’t it?

The Biennale also challenges the idea of art as something static or framed. There is Belgium-based Nigerian artist Otobong Nkanga who is growing a garden at Aspinwall and Argentine artist Adrián Villar Rojas who stuffed decaying food into obsolete fridges.

The theme is ‘For the Time Being’. What does ephemerality mean to you in this context?

Kochi itself feels deeply embedded in many of the works. Ghanaian artist Ibrahim Mahama was talking about how he sourced local sacks with the stamps of trade to turn a Mattancherry warehouse—a relic of its mercantile past—into a Parliament of Ghosts. How important was it that artists work closely with the city?

The Biennale positions itself outside the commercial art market, yet collectors are clearly keeping an eye out for promising artists. Are you surprised by that?

I’ve bumped into many locals and tourists here who admit they’ve never been to a gallery before, and many don’t have an ‘arty’ vocabulary. But you’ve spoken about how it’s okay if audiences don’t understand everything.

Finally, what do you think is the function of a Biennale for someone encountering contemporary art for the first time?

There were some grumbles about the spaces opening while many works were still in process. Did that unfinished state bother you?

The Kochi-Muziris Biennale has never been about polished spectacle. Instead of wine and cheese, there are fried banana fritters, a curator dressed in shorts, with some works unfinished and others still finding their rhythm. Neelam Raaj spoke to curatoron why he wanted to blur hierarchies and invite viewers to experience contemporary art as something dynamic rather than fixedWhat interested me here was working with forms that don’t sit neatly in one category. Take the performance of French artist Uriel Barthélém. He is a drummer and composer but his was not just a music performance, it was also an experimental percussion and visual work. The drum kit is programmed to generate visuals, creating a multidimensional, multisensory experience. For me, it was almost like watching a live painting unfold.It was very much about dismantling hierarchy. We wanted to stop working with a pyramid structure where certain artists are placed on pedestals. By placing emerging artists alongside figures with established practices, the intention was to level the playing field and push back against gatekeeping.It allows younger voices to see their own work and research in dialogue with art history and excellence, and to recognise the strength of their own journeys.Yes, art here is meant to be dynamic. Take Otobong’s garden, for example. It’s freshly planted now, but it will grow and change over the course of the Biennale. Time becomes a material. We have three months to cultivate this exhibition, almost like a garden, and that duration allows works to transform.It’s a series of moments. The Biennale has a beginning and an end, an entry and an exit. We’re acknowledging that we’re passing through time and place. Many of us have been living in Kochi for months, treating it as a residence rather than a temporary site. That kind of immersion is essential.Very much so. Many artists sourced materials locally, worked with students, carpenters, craftspeople, and technicians here. We’re crediting everyone involved, and their names will appear alongside the wall texts and in the catalogue. This exhibition was made collectively, with the city.Artists need to sustain their lives. If art can become an agency for them, there’s nothing wrong with it. For me personally, as a performance artist, I never initially thought about my relationship with the market. Over time, drawing became a sustainable practice that fed my performances, and the performances fed the drawings. It became a symbiotic relationship.That openness is crucial. Someone told me they didn’t understand everything, but they understood what they liked, and that was enough. Local residents, international visitors, first-time viewers, and specialists, everyone is invited to experience it on their own terms.This Biennale, in many ways, is about demystifying making, watching, and interacting with art. It’s about instilling faith in the idea that art and poetry are essential to people’s lives. Contemporary art has the ability to poetically approach difficult conversations— about caste, gender, patriarchy, sexuality—within a space that feels safe and open. The aim is to allow people in, to break away from the white cube of galleries, and to make art feel lived, shared, and human.From the beginning, our curatorial note made it clear that we weren’t afraid of inviting people into that process. Some works were still being adjusted, some artists hadn’t fully completed their installations, and that was fine. People could walk through, see what was there, and also sense that things were still being fixed and tuned. Soon, everything will find its place, but the exhibition itself functions as an activation space over time.",The Kochi-Muziris Biennale runs from September 26 to October 1. The theme is ‘For the Time Being’ and the theme is ephemerality.

India T20Is vs New Zealand:

India T20 World Cup:

Chief selector Ajit Agarkar on Saturday announced India’s squads for the upcoming ICC T20 World Cup and the five-match T20I series against New Zealand. The T20I series will begin on January 21 in Nagpur and will serve as India’s final assignment in the format before the global tournament, scheduled from February 7 to March 8.India have been drawn in Group A for the T20 World Cup, alongside Namibia, the Netherlands, Pakistan, and the United States. The hosts will open their campaign against the USA on February 7 in Mumbai.Despite a lean run with the bat in the recently concluded T20I series against South Africa, which India won 3–1, Suryakumar Yadav has been entrusted with the captaincy for the marquee event. In 20 matches and 18 innings this year, Suryakumar has scored 213 runs at an average of 14.20, striking at just over 125, without registering a single half-century.Suryakumar Yadav (c), Abhishek Sharma, Sanju Samson (wk), Tilak Varma, Hardik Pandya, Shivam Dube, Axar Patel, Jasprit Bumrah, Rinku Singh, Harshit Rana, Arshdeep Singh, Kuldeep Yadav, Varun Chakaravarthy, Washington Sundar, Ishan KishanSuryakumar Yadav (c), Abhishek Sharma, Sanju Samson (wk), Tilak Varma, Hardik Pandya, Shivam Dube, Axar Patel, Jasprit Bumrah, Rinku Singh, Harshit Rana, Arshdeep Singh, Kuldeep Yadav, Varun Chakaravarthy, Washington Sundar, Ishan KishanIndia’s T20 World Cup squad sees some major changes. Notably, Shubman Gill , who was India’s vice-captain in the T20 setup, has been dropped, with all-rounder Axar Patel named as the new vice-captain.Gill had struggled to find form since opening the innings. Brought back into the playing XI as part of the management’s long-term leadership plan, his performances remained underwhelming. In 15 T20 matches since his comeback, Gill has scored 291 runs at an average of 24.25 and a strike rate of 137, failing to register a single fifty.Meanwhile, Sanju Samson, who had performed exceptionally well, including scoring three centuries as an opener, was moved down the order. His Asia Cup performance was mixed, though he finished as India’s third-highest run-scorer with 132 runs, behind Abhishek Sharma (314) and Tilak Varma (213). A solitary outing in Australia at No. 3 yielded little impact, after which Samson was dropped from the playing XI.In the last T20 against South Africa, Samson opened the innings again and scored a solid 37 off 22 balls, giving India a good start. The team management now plans to return to their original composition of playing a wicketkeeper at the top. Consequently, Jitesh Sharma has been dropped, and Ishan Kishan has been drafted as the second keeper.Ishan Kishan and Rinku Singh make the T20 World Cup squad, while Shubman Gill and Jitesh Sharma miss out. Kishan comes off a stellar domestic season in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, where he captained Jharkhand to their maiden T20 title. He finished the season as the highest run-scorer, amassing 517 runs in 10 games at an average of 57.44 and a strike rate of 197.","Ishan Kishan and Rinku Singh make the T20 World Cup squad, while Shubman Gill and Jitesh Sharma miss out.

Why the Mumbai Maidans are being ignored? | Bombay Sport Exchange

NEW DELHI: India all-rounder Hardik Pandya produced a blistering display of power-hitting to lead India to a commanding 30-run victory over South Africa in the fifth and final T20I in Ahmedabad on Friday, sealing the five-match series 3-1. Pandya’s explosive knock set the tone as India piled up a daunting 231 for 5.Pandya smashed a 16-ball half-century — the second-fastest by an Indian in T20 internationals — on his way to a stunning 63 off just 25 deliveries. His innings was laced with five boundaries and five towering sixes.The carnage was complemented by Tilak Varma, who continued his rich vein of form with a fluent 73. Together, the duo stitched a punishing 105-run partnership for the fourth wicket that completely wrested momentum away from the visitors.One of Pandya’s massive sixes led to an unexpected moment off the field when the ball struck a cameraman stationed near the boundary.Showing concern beyond the contest, Pandya immediately walked up to check on the cameraman’s well-being after his innings, ensuring he was attended to and even helping apply an ice pack.Pandya also hugged the cameraman, a gesture that quickly went viral and earned widespread praise from fans.In reply, South Africa began positively and remained in the chase as long as Quinton de Kock was at the crease. The left-hander scored a fighting 65, but once he was dismissed, the innings unravelled rapidly. Varun Chakravarthy spun a web around the middle order, claiming four wickets as South Africa lost seven wickets for 81 runs to finish on 201 for 8.Pandya’s all-round impact and match-defining innings earned him the Player of the Match award.""Winning games is what you play for and it’s always exciting when your contribution helps the team get over the line. No, I actually didn’t know (he has the second fastest fifty for India) until I got out and went back. Our social media guys told me I was the second-fastest,"" Pandya said.Watch the video here ""My first reaction was, “Ah, I missed the top spot!” But happy that Yuvi pa holds that record. Today I just felt it. I actually told my partner beforehand that I was going to step out first ball and try to hit it for six. I was confident it would come off,"" he said.""The situation suited my style; I backed myself and it worked. I took a calculated risk and thankfully it went my way. I’ve always enjoyed the challenge. No matter how many setbacks you face, the aim is to come back stronger, better, and make a bigger impact. When it all comes together, it feels satisfying. But the journey continues - the preparation, the planning, the hard work never stops,"" Pandya said.",India beat South Africa by 30 runs in the fifth and final T20I in Ahmedabad.

I have come to attend the meeting… Congress has taken a decision to contest the elections alone,” Chennithala said.The announcement comes amid one of the most striking political developments in Mumbai ahead of the polls, the growing proximity between Sena UBT chief Uddhav Thackeray and his cousin, Maharashtra Navnirman Sena supremo Raj Thackeray .Once bitter rivals, the cousins now appear aligned in their belief that losing Mumbai would significantly weaken the broader Thackeray political legacy.For Uddhav Thackeray, winning control of the BMC may be the last major opportunity to reassert political relevance after the 2022 split in the Shiv Sena . For Raj Thackeray, the election is being framed as a battle to safeguard Marathi identity, with the MNS presenting itself as the custodian of Maharashtra's linguistic and cultural character.While no formal announcement has been made yet, the Sena (UBT) and MNS are expected to declare their alliance for the BMC polls next week.Notably, the Congress is part of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) alliance in Maharashtra, alongside Uddhav Thackeray’s Shiv Sena (UBT) and Sharad Pawar’s Nationalist Congress Party (NCP - SP).In the 2024 Maharashtra Assembly elections, the MVA suffered a major setback, losing heavily to the BJP-led Mahayuti alliance, which secured a landslide victory.Polling for BMC's 29 municipal corporations, 32 zilla parishads and 336 panchayat samitis will be held on January 15, with results to be declared the following day on January 16.","The Congress on Saturday announced that it will contest the upcoming Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) elections alone.

Chiefs heiress Gracie Hunt says the 15-pound gain came from muscle, recovery, and long-term planning

Chiefs heiress Gracie Hunt shares structured workouts, consistency advice, and public appearance at AmericaFest 2025

Chiefs heiress Gracie Hunt is not playing into the optics game. She is controlling the message herself.Chiefs heiress Gracie Hunt shared a candid breakdown of her 2025 fitness journey on social media this week, openly revealing that she gained about 15 pounds over the past year. The admission was not framed as a setback. It was framed as progress. Hunt said the change came from intentional training, metabolic reset, and a shift away from appearance-driven goals.Chiefs heiress Gracie Hunt positioned the transformation as a long-term commitment to strength and sustainability. Her post focused on how her body performed, how her energy stabilized, and how patience replaced pressure.“My 2025 fitness goal was simple: become the strongest version of myself, inside and out,” she wrote.Chiefs heiress Gracie Hunt made it clear that the year was not about restarting or chasing fast results. She said her approach changed once she prioritized training with intention and respecting recovery.“This year wasn’t about starting over. It was about getting smarter. Training with intention, thinking long-term, and learning that strength, balance, and longevity matter more than chasing quick results. I learned that recovery isn’t optional, it’s part of the work.”Chiefs heiress Gracie Hunt later addressed the weight change directly and explained how it happened.“I reset my metabolism, fueled my body on purpose, and slowly recomposed, adding about 15 lbs of muscle since I began this journey.”She added that she stopped centering progress around appearance. Instead, she focused on how her body felt day to day, when to push, and when to pause. Hunt said the result was steadier energy and sharper focus as the year progressed.The post was paired with workout clips and set to music by The Weeknd, reinforcing the message without changing its tone. Chiefs heiress Gracie Hunt closed the post by stating she ended the year stronger than she began it.Earlier in the week, Chiefs heiress Gracie Hunt shared a separate post labeled “Training Tuesday,” showing an upper-body workout performed outdoors with dumbbells and a mat.“Upper body strength doesn’t have to be complicated. All you need is a set of dumbbells, a mat, and a commitment to show up,” she wrote.“Focus on controlled reps, strong posture, and breathing with intention,quality always beats quantity.”Chiefs heiress Gracie Hunt also advised followers to keep workouts simple and repeatable, especially on busy days. She encouraged starting small rather than skipping sessions entirely.Later that week, Chiefs heiress Gracie Hunt attended Turning Point USA’s AmericaFest in Phoenix. The event runs Dec. 18–21 at the Phoenix Convention Center and honors the legacy of Charlie Kirk, with programming led by his widow Erika Kirk. Hunt shared brief glimpses of the event on social media.While the Kansas City Chiefs continue to navigate an uneven close to the season under owner Clark Hunt, Chiefs heiress Gracie Hunt ended 2025 on her own terms. She defined success by strength gained, habits built, and consistency maintained.“Finishing the year stronger than I started, and remembering that growth never really ends.”","Chiefs heiress Gracie Hunt shared a candid breakdown of her 2025 fitness journey on social media this week.

Puka Nacua controversy and Hallie Aiono selfie dominate headlines



Hailee Aiono (Instagram)

Puka Nacua spent the past week living in two very different spotlights. One belonged to football, where he delivered a performance that usually defines careers. The other belonged to chaos, controversy, and the unforgiving speed of social media. By the time the Rams walked off the field Thursday night, the conversation around their Pro Bowl receiver had little to do with route running or box scores.The noise grew louder off the field. Viral clips, deleted posts, fines, and personal history collided into one messy news cycle. By Friday morning, another unexpected moment added fuel. A selfie from his former partner sent the internet buzzing, proving again how quickly personal lives can eclipse professional brilliance.The storm began earlier in the week during an online interview with popular streamers Adin Ross and N3on. What started as casual banter quickly spiraled. One clip showed Nacua practicing a celebration that drew criticism for being offensive to Jewish people. The backlash was swift, and he issued an apology before the Rams even kicked off.Other remarks from the same session kept circulating. He spoke about avoiding marriage because “they all cheat,” and even dragged pop culture into the mix by blaming Taylor Swift for the Kansas City Chiefs’ struggles this season.None of it helped his image as game day approached.Then came Thursday night. Nacua was dominant, hauling in 12 catches for 225 yards and two touchdowns against Seattle. Still, frustration boiled over. After criticizing officials in the interview, he doubled down following the narrow loss, posting sharp comments aimed at referees. The post disappeared quickly, but the league did not ignore it. A $25,000 fine arrived Friday.As that unfolded, Hallie Aiono stepped into the spotlight. She shared a selfie wearing a shirt that read “GOOFY FOR YOU,” instantly grabbing attention. The timing felt deliberate to fans who remembered their breakup earlier in 2025. The split ended a three-and-a-half-year relationship and included a public paternity test confirming Nacua as the father of their son, Kingston.Despite the past, there have been signs of peace. Aiono was spotted at his recent game, and Nacua later shared a tender moment with his son. Even so, one week of headlines showed how easily personal moments and public missteps can overshadow excellence on the field.Also Read: Puka Nacua gesture explained: Rams star breaks silence with apology after antisemitic controversy goes viral","Rams receiver Puka Nacua has been in the spotlight this week.

Madison Beer explains why online hate hits harder on bad mental health days

Madison Beer balances vulnerability, new music, and public life with Justin Herbert

Madison Beer is not sugarcoating it anymore. Justin Herbert’s girlfriend used an Instagram Q&A this week to speak plainly about how online hate affects her mental health, and her words landed hard with fans who are used to seeing polished photos instead of personal fallout.The singer did not frame it as a one-off bad day or a celebrity complaint. She described a recurring struggle, one that changes depending on her emotional state and one that still cuts deep, even after years in the public eye.Beer addressed the topic after a follower asked how she deals with bullying online. She said her response depends on how grounded she feels that day and whether life outside social media feels stable.“If I'm feeling good in my personal life, having a good day etc, it's much easier for me to brush it off and focus on what's really in front of me these days, which is growth I'm really proud of,” Beer wrote. “But we all know the truth is most days aren't perfect like that. I struggle with my mental health a lot, so it is really painful to go online and read so much negativity about yourself, for anyone. But especially when you are already struggling.She also pushed back on the idea that public figures should simply accept cruelty as part of the job. Beer asked people to think about the weight of what they post and reminded followers that everyone is dealing with something unseen.“It shouldn't matter if someone is struggling or not / wish people were kinder. It's so easy to think but just do really wish people would take the weight of their words, that we've all just human beings living life for the first time and not every opinion u have needs to be shared. Everyone is dealing with something and I don't personally wanna take part in just attacking or ripping others apart just because I could.”Beer added that grounding herself in her own identity and leaning on people who know her personally helps, even though the judgment never fully disappears.The Q&A came just one day after Beer posted photos teasing her upcoming album, Locket, which is set to release on Jan. 16. She captioned the post, “My album comes out in one month,” signaling a major professional moment running parallel to a very personal admission.Beer has previously spoken about feeling supported in her relationship with Los Angeles Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert. On the “Call Her Daddy podcast” on Dec. 10, she described the stability she feels behind the scenes.“I feel like taken care of in a way that I can break down and like I have someone to lean on,” Beer said. “And I think that’s important.”The couple publicly confirmed their relationship on Oct. 5 with a sideline kiss during the Chargers’ game against the Washington Commanders. Since then, Beer has appeared at games and shared glimpses into Herbert’s life away from football, including a recent visit to his family’s animal farm in Oregon.The timing matters. Beer is preparing to release deeply personal music while also navigating the scrutiny that comes with dating a franchise quarterback. Her comments suggest that public visibility does not dull the impact of online cruelty. If anything, it amplifies it.For fans who consume celebrity lives in clips and captions, Beer’s message cuts through that distance. The hate does not stay on the screen. It follows people offline.","Justin Herbert’s girlfriend used an Instagram Q&A this week to speak plainly about how online hate affects her mental health.

Career night ends in frustration for Rams star

Sean McVay stands by Puka Nacua

Also Read:

Los Angeles Rams wide receiver Puka Nacua once again found himself at the center of controversy following Thursday night’s dramatic loss to the Seattle Seahawks, as frustration over officiating spilled onto social media before being quickly walked back.Despite producing the best game of his young NFL career, Nacua’s postgame reaction overshadowed what should have been a headline performance.Nacua was nearly unstoppable against Seattle, finishing with 12 receptions for 225 yards and two touchdowns. The second-year receiver repeatedly torched the Seahawks’ secondary and played a key role as the Rams built a commanding 16-point lead.However, Los Angeles watched that advantage disappear, eventually falling 38-37 in overtime. A late officiating decision that went against the Rams became a major talking point, drawing visible frustration from players on the sideline and fans watching at home.Shortly after the final whistle, Nacua took to X (formerly Twitter) and appeared to take a jab at NFL officials. “Can you say I was wrong,” he wrote, adding, “Appreciate you stripes for your contributions. Lol.”The post was deleted within minutes, but screenshots spread rapidly, ensuring the message reached a wide audience.The timing and wording were widely seen as a direct reference to a controversial late-game call that helped Seattle extend the contest and ultimately secure the win.When asked about the tweet after the game, Nacua acknowledged that emotions got the better of him. “It was just a lack of awareness and frustration after a tough, intense game,” he said.The wide receiver admitted that while players often feel inconsistencies in officiating, those thoughts should remain internal. “There are comments that I should definitely say in the locker room,” Nacua explained. “My job is to focus on my technique so there’s no issue with the call.”Rams head coach Sean McVay was initially unaware of the deleted post during his postgame press conference, declining to comment on something he had not yet seen. However, McVay has already publicly backed Nacua earlier in the week following separate controversy stemming from a livestream appearance.“I know this guy’s heart,” McVay said previously. “He’s a great kid who’s continuing to learn about the platform that he has. We’re going to put our arm around him and help him grow.”Public criticism of officiating has historically drawn fines from the league, and Nacua’s latest comments could again put him on the NFL’s radar. The situation comes at an awkward time, as the receiver had only just issued an apology earlier in the week for unrelated remarks.For the Rams, the priority remains correcting late-game execution after another painful loss. For Nacua, the message is becoming clearer: his elite on-field performances are undeniable, but staying out of controversy off the field will be just as important as the season progresses.","Los Angeles Rams wide receiver Puka Nacua took to Twitter after Thursday night's loss to the Seattle Seahawks.

John Mateer’s path to Oklahoma football, his faith, and the betting allegations

University of Oklahoma quarterback John Mateer has had a college football journey full of big moments, tough questions, and deep belief. At just 21 years old, he became one of the biggest names in Oklahoma football during his first season in Norman. Mateer helped the Sooners reach the College Football Playoff after a strong 10–2 season. Oklahoma also finished the year with four straight wins, showing clear growth when it mattered most. But John Mateer’s path was not smooth. Before he ever took a snap for Oklahoma, his name was linked to a viral sports betting claim. At the same time, Mateer has openly spoken about his faith and how prayer shaped his journey. From a transfer decision to public pressure, his story has drawn attention across college football.As Oklahoma prepared to face Alabama in the first round of the CFP, Mateer made one thing clear, he does not take any moment for granted.“This is everything I could ever ask for as a kid,” Mateer told reporters on Monday, December 15. “I prayed for this opportunity, worked for it, and I’m glad it’s here. I don’t take it for granted.”John Mateer was born in Little Elm, Texas, where football is a big part of life. While his parents were both swimmers, Mateer chose a different road.His father later became a swimming coach at the University of Texas, but football was always Mateer’s passion.“In Dallas, football is so big,” Mateer told Cougfan.com. “I played both football and baseball through high school and just didn’t have any interest in swimming.”John Mateer began his college career at Washington State Cougars. After redshirting in 2022, he played 11 games in 2023. In 2024, he won the starting job and had a breakout year, throwing for 3,139 yards and 29 touchdowns. That season changed everything.In December 2024, Mateer announced his transfer to the Oklahoma Sooners. Soon after, screenshots appeared online in August 2025 showing old Venmo payments labeled “sports gambling.” The claims spread fast.John Mateer responded on X with a clear statement.“The allegations that I once participated in sports gambling are false,” he wrote. “My previous Venmo descriptions did not accurately portray the transactions in question but were instead inside jokes between me and my friends.

Patrick Mahomes’ injury, surgery, and the timeline Kansas City is now staring at

Randi Mahomes thanked supporters as Patrick Mahomes posted ‘why this had to happen’

Patrick Mahomes is already in rehab after a season-ending left knee injury, and his mom is making it clear she is reading every message that comes in. Randi Mahomes posted public thanks this week after the Kansas City Chiefs quarterback underwent surgery, telling supporters she and her family appreciate the prayers and the words of encouragement.The update lands at the worst possible moment for Kansas City. Mahomes tore his left ACL and LCL in Week 15 against the Los Angeles Chargers, and the loss pushed the Chiefs out of playoff contention for the first time in the Mahomes era.Athlon Sports reported Mahomes suffered the injury against the Chargers and later underwent surgery on Monday. The report said the procedure was performed by Dallas Cowboys head physician and orthopedic surgeon Dan Cooper. Kansas City placed Mahomes on injured reserve, and the quarterback has already begun rehab.The medical timeline matters because it shapes everything the Chiefs do next. Chiefs vice president of sports medicine and performance Rick Burkholder said the recovery expectation is nine months, though it could swing by a month or two in either direction, per USA Today. That puts Mahomes’ 2026 season availability at the center of every offseason decision, even if the team stays quiet publicly.ID@undefinedCaption not available.ID@undefinedCaption not available.ID@undefinedCaption not available.Mahomes’ injury also closes the book on a season where he still produced. Athlon Sports noted he recorded 22 passing touchdowns and five rushing scores in 2025 before the knee gave out. Now the conversation shifts from stats to survival: how Kansas City steadies itself without the player it has been built around, and how quickly Mahomes can get back to full strength.The Chiefs missing the playoffs is the loudest headline. Athlon Sports called the Chargers loss the final blow to Kansas City’s postseason hopes. It is also a rare swing in the Mahomes era. Andy Reid’s teams had been a January constant, and Athlon Sports noted Kansas City reached the Super Bowl five times in the last six seasons, winning three. That is the standard Mahomes and the Chiefs are judged by, and it is why this injury lands like a crisis instead of a routine rehab story.The emotional side of this hit the public right away. TMZ reported Mahomes posted a message on X after the injury report became public, and he did not try to dress it up.“Don’t know why this had to happen,” Mahomes wrote. “And not going to lie, it’s hurts. But all we can do now is Trust in God and attack every single day over and over again.” He also addressed the fan base directly in the same TMZ report.“Thank you, Chiefs kingdom, for always supporting me and for everyone who has reached out and sent prayers. I will be back stronger than ever.”TMZ noted Randi Mahomes shared his message with a heart and prayer emoji, and her own posts kept the focus on gratitude. Athlon Sports reported she wrote a public message while also sharing about her “Home for the Holidays” event for the Kansas City community.“Thank you all for the prayers and kind messages for Patrick. We truly appreciate every one of them,” she wrote.Athlon Sports also reported she added a second note on her Instagram Stories. “Thank you for lifting Patrick up in prayer. We’re so thankful for this community.”That is the cleanest read on the moment. The family is not selling false optimism. They are acknowledging reality, leaning on faith, and keeping the message tight: Mahomes has surgery behind him, rehab in front of him, and a fan base watching every step.For the Chiefs, the next part is not dramatic. It is practical. Mahomes’ rehab is the story now, and the rest of the roster gets judged by how it responds to life without him. The one piece of good news, per Athlon Sports, is that Mahomes is on track to return to full health when the 2026 NFL season comes around. The rest is patience, and nine months can feel like forever when you are Kansas City.Moreover, Travis Kelce addressed speculation about his future with Patrick Mahomes on Friday, Dec. 19, after reporters asked whether the two might no longer play together following Mahomes’ season-ending knee injury. The 36-year-old Kansas City Chiefs tight end called the idea hard to process, responding, “Oh man, that’s crazy,” before making it clear his focus remains on the team. Kelce acknowledged this is “a unique time” in his career but stressed that he is locked in on finishing the season strong, saying he wants the attention on winning games and supporting the locker room rather than discussing what comes next.What's interesting is that the Tennessee Titans host the Kansas City Chiefs on Dec. 21 at Nissan Stadium, still searching for their first home win in 413 days after last winning in Nashville on Nov. 3, 2024, against the New England Patriots. Tennessee faces a rare opportunity against a Chiefs team already eliminated from playoff contention and without Patrick Mahomes, who suffered ACL and LCL tears last week. Gardner Minshew is set to start at quarterback, leading most analysts to expect a close, low-scoring game with mixed predictions on whether the Titans can finally snap their home losing streak.",Randi Mahomes thanks fans for their prayers as Patrick Mahomes begins rehab after season-ending knee surgery.

Maple Leafs fans on edge after reporter claims Auston Matthews trade talks may be closer than believed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/maple-leafs-fans-on-edge-after-reporter-claims-auston-matthews-trade-talks-may-be-closer-than-believed/articleshow/126059895.cms,"Auston Matthews trade rumor (Getty Images)

Auston Matthews and the pressure point Toronto cannot ignore

The mood around the Maple Leafs has shifted from confidence to caution. Toronto entered the season expecting its captain to set the pace, yet nights now pass where the scoreboard stays silent for stretches that feel unfamiliar. Auston Matthews still generates chances, still competes hard in all three zones, but goals no longer arrive with the same inevitability. In a market that measures greatness shift by shift, that absence has grown louder than any cheer.What makes this moment heavier is timing. Toronto is not rebuilding or experimenting. This is a team built to win now. When production stalls at the center of that plan, anxiety spreads quickly. Conversations that once felt unthinkable are now whispered openly, not because Matthews has fallen off, but because expectations around him remain sky high.The tension spiked when Maple Leafs reporter Howard Berger suggested the organization will not move forward until Auston Matthews asks for a trade, possibly by this year’s trade deadline. That idea alone rattled the fanbase. Matthews has been the franchise constant for nearly a decade.Imagining Toronto without him feels like pulling a load-bearing wall from the house.On the ice, the frustration has roots. Auston Matthews continues to win faceoffs, backcheck, and handle defensive responsibility. Yet Toronto pays him to swing games offensively. At five-on-five, his line has not consistently owned shifts. On the power play, the dominance that once felt automatic has faded into predictability. The looks are there, but the finish has gone missing.That gap between effort and outcome feeds scrutiny. In Toronto, leadership is judged through goals when the stakes rise. When scoring dries up, every shift becomes a test of authority and legacy. Nick Kypreos tried to strike a more hopeful tone in the Toronto Star, but optimism struggles to breathe when results lag behind reputation.The coaching staff has searched for answers. Different wingers, altered looks, and tactical tweaks have come and gone. The puck still moves well, but the instinctive scoring touch that defined Matthews has not returned with consistency. There is also quiet talk of tension with coach Craig Berube, another layer that complicates an already delicate situation.Trading a captain in his prime is not standard practice. Neither is standing still while doubt grows inside a contender. Toronto management now faces a narrow path where action and inaction both carry consequences. Whether Berger’s report proves prophetic or premature, it captures how fragile this stretch feels.Matthews remains elite. Yet in this market, elite alone no longer settles the noise. The next few months will decide more than standings. They will define how this era is remembered, and whether Auston Matthews and Toronto find clarity together or part under pressure.Also Read: Are Auston Matthews and Craig Berube drifting apart as Maple Leafs struggles spark tense locker-room speculation?","The mood around the Maple Leafs has shifted from confidence to caution.

How Seth Jarvis’ injury could impact the Carolina Hurricanes’ season



Seth Jarvis’ injury has sent a push through the Carolina Hurricanes’ season at a time when consistency and scoring depth were all that mattered. The forward went down hard in overtime against the Florida Panthers at Amerant Bank Arena, and the result is worrying for the team as he is set to be “out for a while,” as per the head coach Rod Brind’Amour.The moment unfolded quickly and brutally. Twenty seconds into overtime, Jarvis drove hard to the net while being pressured by Evan Rodrigues and crashed full speed into the left post. He could not get back to his feet on his own, needed support to leave the ice, and disappeared. Brind’Amour did not sugarcoat it afterward, calling the injury “not good,” leaving Carolina fans concerned about a significant absence.Before the injury, Jarvis was not just another piece of the lineup. He was one of the Hurricanes’ most productive forwards this season, sitting second on the team with 29 points from 19 goals and 10 assists in just 34 games. He also delivered two assists in that very game, helping Carolina race to a 3-0 lead before Florida fought back, forced overtime, and eventually won 4-3 in a shootout. Losing a player producing at that level is a major competitive blow.Beyond current form, Jarvis has been a central part of Carolina’s offense in recent years.The 23-year-old star has already established himself as a well-renowned name in the NHL with 240 points under his belt and a pattern of upping his game come playoff time with 43 points in 55 postseason games. This particular skill of his makes the injury particularly troublesome with a Hurricane franchise still seeking consistency.With no fixed time frame on when he would return, Carolina finds himself dealing with lineups that will need some changes, new roles, and new players being called on to provide the same level of point production that Jarvis brings. His absence changes matchups, special-teams decisions, and overall offensive rhythm. For a team built on depth and structure, this is a real test. As the Hurricanes navigate the coming weeks, every update on Seth Jarvis will matter because his health could shape not only their immediate stretch of games but also the direction of their season.Also Read: Seth Jarvis injury update: Andrei Svechnikov’s high stick takes Hurricanes forward out with upper-body setback","Seth Jarvis went down hard in overtime against the Florida Panthers.

In March 2025, Xavier Worthy showed off his new custom-built garage, almost a year after his expensive car was stolen

In May 2024, Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver Xavier Worthy’s expensive car was stolen after it went missing overnight, the Kansas City Police Department told the Kansas City Star. The car was reportedly taken from a downtown parking garage at Two Light Apartments in the 1400 block of Grand Boulevard. A source for Mike Florio of NBC Sports said Worthy’s car was stolen from a residential garage by a professional group of criminals who “knew exactly what they were doing.” Xavier was not in the car when it was taken and was unharmed; there was no carjacking. Only a month had passed since the Chiefs drafted him in the first round when his car was stolen. As of late 2025, there have reportedly been no public reports indicating that Worthy ever recovered his stolen car. Cut to the present: through his TikTok pages, Worthy reportedly owns four cars costing over $1 million. Let’s find out which are those.According to Spotrac, Chiefs wide receiver Xavier Worthy signed a four-year contract worth $13.79 million in June 2024.

Montreal Canadiens bring back Phillip Danault from Los Angeles Kings in major trade move,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/montreal-canadiens-bring-back-phillip-danault-from-los-angeles-kings-in-major-trade-move/articleshow/126093118.cms,"Phillip Danault reunites with Montreal Canadiens (Image via: Getty Images)

The Montreal Canadiens’ strategy in bringing back Phillip Danault from Los Angeles Kings



The Montreal Canadiens have reacquired center Phillip Danault from the Los Angeles Kings in exchange for a second-round pick in the 2026 NHL Draft. Danault, 32, returns to the team where he played from 2015 through 2021, bringing familiarity, experience, and stability to Montreal’s lineup as the team looks to improve midseason.Danault’s return is straightforward: the Canadiens wanted to get better. Known for his defensive reliability and versatility, he can contribute at both ends of the ice. With one year remaining on his $5.5 million contract, Danault adds depth down the middle while mentoring younger players in Montreal’s roster.Danault was originally a first-round pick by the Chicago Blackhawks in 2011 and has since played 741 NHL games, scoring 399 points, including 125 goals and 274 assists. In 62 playoff games, he scored 28 points, proving his ability to perform in high-pressure scenarios.From 2015 to 2021, Danault recorded 194 points in 360 games with the Canadiens. He has five assists in 30 games this season with the Kings, but he does more than just score. He can handle challenging matchups against elite opponents and is a good defensive player who excels on penalty kills.Adding Phillip Danault to the lineup is also expected to bring some stability to the team's scoring lineup because Danault has extensive experience with the system used by the team.Danault’s experience with the Canadiens goes beyond the stats as well. He knows the locker room, the culture of the team, as well as the ability to mentor some of the young players. This will go a long way in maintaining some sort of balance, something the Canadiens would need as they make a push for the playoffs.In general, the Canadiens are doing what is required of them at this stage; this is because the team is looking for a trusted and seasoned center who can play the opposition from start to finish. The return of Danault is expected to boost the depth, veteran leadership, and overall performance of the Canadiens ahead of the playoffs.Also Read: NHL trade rumors: Phillip Danault linked with potential move from LA Kings as Montreal Canadiens, New Jersey Devils and Carolina Hurricanes emerge as top contendors","The Montreal Canadiens have reacquired center Phillip Danault from the Los Angeles Kings in exchange for a second-round pick in the 2026 NHL Draft.

Broncos defense faces a major test, but Jones’ message sets the tone

The Denver Broncos’ Week 15 win felt like a very strong promise to see and envision a strong playoff push. However, the mood shifted once news broke that Brandon Jones would miss the rest of the season. The Denver Broncos safety suffered an unfortunate pectoral injury, which has now severely impacted what had been one of his most impactful years in the NFL Jones’ spirit and determination seem to be intact despite the injury, as seen in his new post on Instagram.

Anthony Davis powers through illness as Dallas Mavericks prepare for tough road test against Philadelphia 76ers

Anthony Davis’ long-term future in Dallas faces fresh doubt as trade talk grows louder

The Dallas Mavericks, who have an uncomfortable 11-17 record and are ranked 11th in the West, will play the Philadelphia 76ers tonight. Throughout the season, the Mavs have appeared disconnected from success. Cooper Flagg, their newest recruit, had a difficult rookie season, and Anthony Davis, Luka Doncic's successor, is probably going to be replaced shortly.Despite being in challenging physical condition, Davis performed admirably in a victory against the Detroit Pistons last time out. Despite having a damaged left calf and an illness, the Mavericks big man continued to play a lot of minutes and had a great influence despite missing a recent game due to the ailment.On Saturday night, the Philadelphia 76ers (15-11) will play the Dallas Mavericks (11-17) in the second half of a back-to-back game. The upcoming 25th Anniversary Celebration Game, which is sponsored by Crypto.com and has a retro Hardwood Classic theme, will begin at Xfinity Mobile Arena at 7 p.m. ET.Without Anthony Davis, Dallas defeated the Detroit Pistons 116-114 in overtime on Thursday. With 23 points and 10 rebounds, top choice Cooper Flagg—who turns 19 on Sunday—recorded his fourth NBA double-double.The last time out, Davis made a valiant attempt against the Detroit Pistons. Despite nearly missing the game, Davis played a significant amount of time and finished with an outstanding 15 points, 18 rebounds, and 3 blocks in an overtime victory.In 37 minutes of action, he ended with 15 points, 18 rebounds, and 3 blocks to help the Mavs win 116-114 in overtime on Thursday. Davis stated after the game that although he is still feeling under the weather, he did his best to support his team's victory.“Still feel under the weather,” Davis said. “I actually threw up twice during the game, but I’m just trying to compete. I’m just trying to do whatever I can to help the team win. Just leaving it all on the floor.”The Mavs will now travel to Philadelphia on Saturday to play the 76ers. Despite his illness, Davis is listed as probable for the forthcoming game. This season, Davis has made 12 appearances and averaged 19.6 points, 10.8 rebounds, 3.1 assists, and 1.8 blocks per contest.It's possible that Anthony Davis' future in Dallas won't be as unclear as the Mavericks would like. Despite Dallas's public indications that an extension might still be in the works, ESPN's Tim MacMahon stated this week that he anticipates Davis being dealt.“The Mavericks are telling people, ‘Oh, we still might extend him this summer,’” MacMahon said. “If you do that, that’s not gonna be good business for the Mavericks. I’m being told that and I don’t believe that.“I’ll put it like that. I think it’s a matter of when and not if Anthony Davis is traded. I just don’t know when.”Davis may be the most likely trade departure since he gives the Bulls the most opportunity to recover choices, according to Sam Quinn of CBS Sports.“A trade seemed certain the moment Nico Harrison was fired. Now, there’s a bit of uncertainty. The Mavericks are playing well. Kyrie Irving could return. Could Harrison’s dream be fulfilled by his successors? That’s the question mark here,” Quinn wrote.In August, Davis will be eligible for a four-year deal worth a maximum of $275 million. In addition to earning $54.1 million this season and $58.5 million the following year, he has a $62.8 million player option for 2027–2028.Also read: NBA injury update: Dallas Mavericks guard Dante Exum ruled out for entire season after knee surgery","The Dallas Mavericks, who have an uncomfortable 11-17 record and are ranked 11th in the West, will play the Philadelphia 76ers tonight.

Luka Doncic goes into Saturday night without a clear answer attached to his name. He is not listed as out or questionable for the Lakers’ December 20 game against the Clippers, which usually points toward availability. Still, the situation is not clean. The Lakers are short-handed, and Doncic has dealt with small interruptions this season that make any appearance worth monitoring.Since arriving in February 2025, Doncic has carried a heavy load. The Los AngelesLakers depend on him to organize the offense, control pace, and close games. With the roster thinned by injuries, his presence or absence matters more than usual.The Lakers and Clippers meet again at Crypto.com Arena, a matchup that rarely needs added context. Both teams are chasing position in the West, and games like this often matter later when tiebreakers surface. If Doncic plays, the Lakers lean on his steady production, around 35 points, eight rebounds, and nine assists per game, alongside LeBron James, who is not listed on the injury report.There is no official injury keeping Luka Doncic off the floor. That stands out after earlier absences tied to personal reasons and minor issues such as a finger sprain.He remains the focal point of the offense and recently finished with 29 points in a win despite an uneven shooting night. His conditioning work has helped him handle long stretches with the ball, and if he plays, the Lakers expect him to run the game.Los Angeles Lakers are missing several rotation players, which tightens the margin for error.With Reaves and Vincent unavailable, ball-handling duties fall even more heavily on Doncic and James.The Clippers are also dealing with absences across the lineup.If James Harden plays, he becomes a direct matchup concern in isolation.","Luka Doncic is not listed as out or questionable for the Lakers’ December 20 game against the Clippers, which usually points toward availability.

Sebastian Coe’s words fuel belief in Britain’s next middle-distance star Ben Hoggins



Sebastian Coe: The Record-Breaking Legend Behind World Athletics #shorts

Some athletic records seem untouchable. Sebastian Coe ’s British 800-metre record of 1:41.73, set in 1981, is one of them. For almost 50 years, it has stood as the standard for every British middle-distance runner. Now, the conversation is shifting as new talent emerges and belief grows that the mark could finally fall.That belief has been backed by Coe himself. The World Athletics President has publicly praised the 23-year-old Olympian Ben Hoggins. His comments have added serious weight to growing expectations around British middle-distance running. With Scotland producing world champions and confidence rising across the squad, the moment feels right for a challenge to one of the sport’s greatest national records.Sebastian Coe has rarely spoken so openly about a young British runner. His praise for Hoggins reflects more than talent. It highlights mindset and belief. Speaking to Athletics Weekly, Coe said, “He’s very talented, and you need to win things and with that comes an infectious confidence.”He then compared Hoggins to Britain’s current stars and said, “I’ve seen that with Jake (Wightman) and Josh (Kerr) as well. You need to get up onto pole position ,and sometimes the rest of your career just follows.It’s a psychological breakthrough as much as anything.”Britain is currently enjoying a golden era in middle-distance running. Wightman ended a 38-year wait for a men’s 1500m world title in 2022. Kerr followed by winning the world championship a year later. Both victories echoed the dominance of Coe’s own era.While Hoggins looks to the future, another British runner has already come close to Coe’s record. At the 2025 World Championships in Tokyo, Max Burgin ran a personal best of 1:42.29. That time was just 0.56 seconds away from the legendary mark.The race was described by Coe as a “proper, proper 800m race.” It was fast from the opening lap. The pace helped push Burgin to a new level. After the race, Burgin said he now feels “comfortable at that low 1:42” and added that it “makes sense next year to be pushing to those 1:41s.”That performance showed the record is no longer safe. With Burgin closing in and Hoggins earning Coe’s trust, British athletics may finally be approaching a historic run.Also Read: Adam Peaty and Holly Ramsay escape to Lapland for holidays ahead of wedding amid family drama and swimmer’s mom's 60th birthday","Sebastian Coe has publicly praised British middle-distance star Ben Hoggins.

Toronto Maple Leafs' Craig Berube calls power play “God Awful” after 4-0 loss to Washington Capitals,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/toronto-maple-leafs-craig-berube-calls-power-play-god-awful-after-4-0-loss-to-washington-capitals/articleshow/126079975.cms,"Toronto Maple Leafs Craig Berube

Maple Leafs' power play ranks third-last in NHL after loss to Washington Capitals

NHL Highlights | Maple Leafs vs. Capitals - December 18, 2025

Head coach Craig Berube isn’t happy with the performance against Washington Capitals

The Toronto Maple Leafs suffered a humiliating 4-0 shutout loss to the Washington Capitals on Thursday night. The defeat exposed numerous flaws throughout the lineup, but none more glaring than the power play.Head coach Craig Berube didn't mince words when addressing his team's performance on the power play. Toronto entered Thursday's game sitting 30th in the NHL with a power play operating at just 15 percent.After failing to convert on five opportunities against Washington, that number dropped to 14 percent. Only the Calgary Flames rank lower at 13.8 percent. The Maple Leafs have scored a league-worst 12 goals on 85 power play opportunities this season.No other team in the NHL has scored fewer goals with the man advantage despite Toronto's elite offensive talent. The franchise that once operated one of the deadliest power plays in hockey now looks completely lost when given an extra skater.Back in the 2022-23 season, opponents feared taking penalties against Toronto. The Maple Leafs made teams pay consistently with their lethal combination of skill and execution.Now, the opposite holds. When Toronto goes to the man advantage, their opponents become almost immortal.The Leafs struggle to generate shots on net, and half the time they can't even gain entry into the offensive zone. Berube delivered a scathing assessment of the power play following Thursday's shutout""The power play has actually been getting better, but tonight it was god-awful, in my opinion,"" the coach said bluntly. He acknowledged the second unit created some chances but reserved his harshest criticism for the top unit.""Our top unit didn't execute, didn't win any battles when they needed to, just couldn't make plays,"" Berube stated. The numbers tell a damning story. Toronto tallied just five shots during five power play opportunities throughout the entire game.The lack of offensive zone time and quality chances made Washington's penalty kill look effortless. When asked whether personnel changes might be necessary, Berube didn't rule anything out. ""Yeah, it could be. Yeah, for sure. That's something we'll definitely look at,"" he confirmed.The admission signals potential shakeups could be coming to a unit that features former Rocket Richard Trophy winner Auston Matthews, runner-up William Nylander, and 38-goal scorer John Tavares. Matthew Knies, Morgan Rielly, and Oliver Ekman-Larsson round out the options.For a team with that much firepower, power-play goals should come easily. Instead, Toronto's man advantage has become a liability that opponents no longer fear. Unless something changes dramatically, the Maple Leafs' championship aspirations will continue being derailed by their inability to capitalize on the most basic advantage in hockey.",Maple Leafs' power play ranks third-last in NHL after loss to Washington Capitals.

Asmongold and Wendy Ortiz have had enough with the tipping obsession





Popular Kick streamer Asmongold is weighing in on the recent controversy regarding Wendy Ortiz's sister, Evelyn Ortiz’s recent encounter with a waitress. The controversy began after a short clip from Ortiz’s IRL livestream spread rapidly across X and Reddit. The video showed a waitress confronting Ortiz for leaving a $5 tip on a $250 bill. Despite Evelyn trying to prevent any unnecessary conflict, the waitress was less than impressed at the act.Asmongold addressed the whole awkward situation, criticizing tipping culture as a whole. The streamer called it a side effect of slavery and a form of abuse that should not be entertained. Ortiz also reflected on the incident, calling out how one should not be upset at the amount they got tipped.Reacting to Evelyn’s video, Asmongold wrote on X, “Tipping, a side effect from slavery, is a psyop created by the business ruling class to pit the middle class against the working class. Engaging in tip-shaming or forms of social compliance to continue tipping works solely to continue this abuse. Never tip if you don't want to.""Wendy Ortiz later addressed the situation directly, offering a more personal perspective shaped by her own experience.She pushed back on the idea that tips should be expected or demanded, saying, ""As a waitress/waiter, I don't think you can expect a tip and be, like, upset at what they got tipped.""At the same time, she made it clear she does believe in and advocate for the need to tip when services are good and even often reminds others to do so. Wendy also pointed out how unusual the US tipping culture can feel compared to other countries, where people get offended and become unnecessarily rude when they are not tipped.This latest news comes in light of Wendy Ortiz’s recent public clash with FaZe Clan member Rani “Stable Ronaldo” earlier this month, where she called him a woman-hater. Although Asmongold was not a fan of her comments then, he now comes to the defense of her sister, who got embroiled in an unnecessary conflict.Also read: Wendy Ortiz apologizes after calling Stable Ronaldo a “woman hater”","Kick streamer Asmongold is weighing in on the recent controversy regarding Wendy Ortiz's sister, Evelyn Ortiz's recent encounter with a waitress.

Brandon Lowe headline piece in Rays, Astros, and Pirates trade talks

“If completed, outfielder Jacob Melton and right-hander Anderson Brito would head to the Rays.”

Brandon Lowe could be on the move soon. The Tampa Bay Rays are in active talks on a possible three-team trade with the Houston Astros and the Pittsburgh Pirates, according to reports on Wednesday from The Athletic. The deal is still being discussed, but it could change all three rosters before the MLB offseason moves forward.The talks involve power, pitching, and young talent. If completed, the trade would send Brandon Lowe out of Tampa Bay after several strong seasons. It would also give Houston pitching help and allow Pittsburgh to add a much-needed bat to its lineup.According to The Athletic reporters Chandler Rome and Ken Rosenthal, the current framework sends Brandon Lowe from the Tampa Bay Rays to the Pittsburgh Pirates. Lowe is 31 years old and has been one of Tampa Bay’s top hitters when healthy.In the 2025 season, Brandon Lowe hit .256 with 31 home runs and 83 RBIs. He remained one of the best power-hitting second basemen in baseball.Since 2019, only Marcus Semien and Jose Altuve have more home runs at the position. The Pirates are looking for offense after struggling to score runs last season.Brandon Lowe would give them power in the middle of the order right away.Pittsburgh would also receive Rays outfielder Jake Mangum and left-handed pitcher Mason Montgomery if the deal goes through.Lowe’s contract runs through the 2026 season, which makes this a key decision point for Tampa Bay as it looks to balance payroll and long-term planning.In the same deal, the Pittsburgh Pirates would send right-handed pitcher Mike Burrows to the Houston Astros.Mike Burrows is 26 years old and posted a 3.94 ERA during the 2025 season. Houston is looking to add pitching depth after dealing with injuries and workload issues.Tampa Bay would receive Astros outfield prospect Jacob Melton and right-handed pitcher Anderson Brito. Ken Rosenthal reported,Jacob Melton is viewed as a strong young outfield prospect with upside. Anderson Brito gives Tampa Bay another arm to develop. The Rays are known for building depth through trades like this.There is still work to be done. Talks are ongoing, and nothing is final yet.

Macklin Celebrini breaks Wayne Gretzky’s teenage points record, now eyes Sidney Crosby ’s mark



Macklin Celebrini has officially stepped into rare NHL territory, and he has done it in a way that feels both ruthless and inevitable. The San Jose Sharks’ 19-year-old sensation has moved past Wayne Gretzky in the NHL record books for teenage scoring before Christmas, and that alone tells you the scale of what he is doing this season. This is not hype; it is production backed by consistency.With two more assists on Thursday, Celebrini climbed to 18 goals and 35 assists through 35 games, pushing his tally to 53 points before the holiday break. Gretzky, back in the 1980-81 season, had 51 points as a teenager. Passing a name like Gretzky is never a casual headline in the NHL, but Celebrini has made it feel like part of his natural progression.Celebrini’s surge does not sit in isolation. He has stacked 10 points in his last four games, which speaks to rhythm, confidence, and a clear command of the NHL pace. He is closing in on another benchmark too. Sidney Crosby owns the modern mark with 55 points before Christmas as a teenager, and with two games left for San Jose before the break, Celebrini has a very real shot to leap past that as well. The opportunity begins Saturday when the Sharks meet the Seattle Kraken, and at this stage, it hardly matters who the opponent is. Celebrini has shown he can control games against anyone.After posting 63 points in 70 games as a rookie, Celebrini has accelerated sharply in year two with 53 points in just 35 games. That is star-level efficiency. It signals growth, maturity, and an offensive ceiling that continues to stretch higher. Watching him now, it feels less like a breakout and more like a player settling into who he is supposed to become: one of the best forwards in the league.Breaking Gretzky’s teenage pace would be enough to define a season for most players. For Celebrini, it looks like another checkpoint. With this trajectory, it is difficult to imagine this being the last historic mark he pushes aside.","Macklin Celebrini has broken Wayne Gretzky’s teenage points record.

Why the Mumbai Maidans are being ignored? | Bombay Sport Exchange

NEW DELHI: India ended the T20I series against South Africa on a high by winning the fifth and final match and sealing the five-match series 3-1 on Friday at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad.With this win, India have managed to extend their unbeaten streak. They are now on a streak of 10 consecutive series wins (including major tournaments).With the 4th T20I in Lucknow being abandoned earlier because of heavy fog, everyone wanted to see a full game, and the players didn't disappoint at all.India put up a big total of 231 for 5 after South Africa won the toss and chose to bowl.The batting effort was led by Tilak Varma and Hardik Pandya . Tilak played a steady and attacking knock, scoring 73 runs off 42 balls.Hardik provided the late surge with a quick 63 off just 25 balls, hitting five 4s and five 6s. Sanju Samson and Abhishek Sharma also gave India a strong start at the top.Chasing 232, South Africa began well. Quinton de Kock was in fine form and attacked the Indian bowlers from the start. South Africa matched India’s Powerplay score and stayed in the hunt.When Dewald Brevis joined de Kock, the visitors picked up momentum. The pair played freely and took South Africa to 118 runs at the halfway mark, putting pressure back on the Indian side.At that point, the match seemed evenly balanced. That is when India captain Suryakumar Yadav turned to his most trusted bowler, Jasprit Bumrah . Bumrah made an immediate impact by dismissing de Kock with a sharp return catch.

Coaching stability remains Jerry Jones’ priority

Also Read:

Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones has finally addressed two of the most pressing questions surrounding the franchise: Trevon Diggs’ uncertain future and the team’s coaching direction, as the Cowboys limp toward the end of a disappointing season.With playoff hopes nearly extinguished and internal tensions surfacing, Jones’ comments offer rare clarity on where the organization currently stands.Speaking on 105.3 The FAN, Jones pushed back against growing speculation that Trevon Diggs may have played his final snap in a Cowboys uniform. The Pro Bowl cornerback has not featured since Week 6 and remains on injured reserve, despite recent claims that he is healthy enough to return.“I think that’s a stretch to put that thing that far out,” Jones said, attempting to cool the narrative surrounding Diggs’ long-term future. “On my basis, looking at his situation, I don’t have that kind of attitude about him.”Diggs’ absence has been layered with complexity. While the team has cited health and practice performance as factors, Diggs himself has publicly expressed frustration, stating that the decision to keep him sidelined is no longer in his control.Reports of behind-the-scenes tension, particularly related to scheme fit and rehabilitation preferences have only fueled uncertainty.With a looming deadline to activate Diggs off injured reserve, Dallas must decide whether to bring him back for the final stretch or shut him down for the season. Regardless, Jones’ remarks suggest the Cowboys are not yet prepared to close the door on the All-Pro cornerback.While Diggs’ situation remains fluid, Jones was far more definitive when discussing the Cowboys’ coaching outlook. Despite the team’s struggles and a record hovering around .500, Jones voiced strong confidence in head coach Brian Schottenheimer’s leadership.“He’s had an outstanding year,” Jones said. “He’s technically as sound as you can draw up. We like his philosophy of how to play football.”Jones highlighted the adversity Schottenheimer has faced from injuries to roster instability, and praised his ability to manage multiple responsibilities, including play-calling duties. The endorsement signals continuity rather than upheaval, even as fans clamor for major changes.Jones’ comments underline a broader reality in Dallas: the Cowboys are not planning a dramatic reset just yet. Instead, the franchise appears committed to internal evaluation rather than sweeping change.However, unresolved questions remain. Diggs’ relationship with the coaching staff, defensive scheme compatibility, and overall roster health will shape the offseason narrative. Meanwhile, Schottenheimer’s long-term security may depend on how convincingly Dallas finishes the year.For now, Jones’ message is clear, patience over panic. Whether that approach resonates with fans or yields results on the field is a different matter entirely.",Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones downplays Trevon Diggs exit speculation.
