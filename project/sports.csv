Top 5 Quarterbacks in the NFL in 2024: From Patrick Mahomes to Lamar Jackson,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/top-5-quarterbacks-in-the-nfl-in-2024-from-patrick-mahomes-to-lamar-jackson/articleshow/116045102.cms,"Image via Shuttestock

Patrick Mahomes

Lamar Jackson

Josh Allen

Tua Tagovailoa

Joe Burrow

A quarterback (QB) is a position in gridiron football in which play is made by members of the offensive side of the ball, lining up mostly behind an offensive line. In modern American football, the quarterback is usually thought of as the leader of the offense and handles calling the plays within the huddle.Again, the quarterback touches the ball on almost every offensive play and is almost always the offensive player that will throw the forward pass. If the QB is brought down behind the line of scrimmage, it is called a sack. It is also known colloquially as ""the signal caller"" and ""field general"". Here are the top 5 quarterbacks in the 2024 season.The chief quarterback endorsing three consecutive Super Bowl championship victories for the Kansas City Chiefs had overtaken Len Dawson in passing yards, according to the records of the Chiefs by winning against the Ravens 27-20. Patrick Mahomes celebrated his 77th win in the regular season with a win over the Atlanta Falcons as he also surpassed Tom Brady and Roger Staubach on the most wins by a quarterback in first 100 starts. He crossed the milestone of 30,000 career passing yards in just 103 games during Week 8, breaking Matthew Stafford's previous record of 109 games. The Chiefs won the first nine games of the season, thereby equalling the franchise record for the best start.Lamar Jackson 's incredible career rushing record made him the third biggest bulk-rusher by passing an NFL icon Russell Wilson in all-time career rushing yards in the 1-Night Show venue. He achieved passing completions and put up victories for his team's leads over the Dallas Cowboys and Buffalo Bills while throwing at a passer rating of 135+= in both games. He passed for 348 yards and four touchdowns in the 41-38 overtime victory against the Bengals. In Week 7, he threw even better than 17-of-22 passes for 281 yards.In Week 9, Jackson had a perfect quarterback rating for the fourth time in his career as he went 16 of 19 for 280 yards and three touchdowns in a 41-10 rout of the Denver Broncos. He became the first player in league history to have four perfect games on record while making at least 15 passing attempts. Jackson exhibited his best fourth quarter in Week 10, throwing for 197 yards, three touchdowns, and a perfect passer rating in the final quarter. Jackson passed over the 3,000 passing yards mark for the season in Week 12 with 177 yards, two touchdown passes, and a rushing touchdown in a 30-23 win against the Los Angeles Chargers.Josh Allen and the Bills started the 2024 season strong despite the fact that Stefon Diggs, Gabe Davis and some other veteran players very recently cut needed to remain under the team's salary cap to add Khalil Shakir, Allen's only returning wideout, to his roster from last season. Allen tossed two passing touchdowns and rushed for another during Monday Night Football in a game that the Bills won 23–20 against the Jets. Those three overall touchdowns enabled Allen to break Patrick Mahomes' record for most total touchdowns in any player's first seven seasons.In Week 11 against the undefeated Chiefs, Allen completed 262 yards of passing while leading the team with 55 rushing yards, including a 26-yard touchdown scramble on fourth down that basically put the game away as the Bills won 30-21. In Week 13 against the 49ers, Allen became the first quarterback in NFL history to score a touchdown by passing, rushing, and receiving in the same game, with the passing and receiving touchdowns coming on the same play, a successful improvised hook and lateral with Amari Cooper.Tua Tagovailoa would go on to have other misfortunes: during Thursday Night Football, on September 12, with the Bills, Tagovailoa earned another concussion, this time by leading with his helmet into contact with safety Damar Hamlin after scrambling. The injury was tagged down to October 27 when Tagovailoa returned in Week 8 against the Arizona Cardinals, throwing for 28-of-38 finished passes, garnering 234 yards and a touchdown before the Dolphins lost on a walk-off field goal, plunging their record to 2-5.The Bills were next onto the field, where Tagovailoa completed a career-best 89.3% of his passes (25-of-28) and led a driving touchdown with less than two minutes remaining, before the Dolphins lost to another last-second field goal. The other Dolphins star tagged along and helped break a three-game losing streak with timely throws: 9 of 12, resulting in 137 yards on a 23-15 victory versus the Los Angeles Rams. More magic ensued as Miami improved to 5-6 against the Raiders and Patriots, completing over 70% of his passes for 605 yards, seven touchdowns, and no interceptions across two games.Joe Burrow passed for 353 yards and a career-high five touchdown passes in the team's 41–38 overtime loss against the Baltimore Ravens during Week 5. In Week 6, Burrow won the last two games against the New York Giants and Cleveland Browns, including a career-long 47-yard touchdown against the Giants and two scores in the second half against the Crimson Tide. Burrow completed 251 yards and a career-high-tying five touchdown passes with one interception to get a solid performance against the Las Vegas Raiders in Week 9, leading to a position of 41–24.After that, Burrow managed to connect on 428 yards and four touchdowns against the Ravens and followed up with a similar performance against the Chargers, where he threw 356 yards and three touchdowns, again. Adding salt to injury, the Bengals faced both losses thereby making Burrow the first in the history of football to record the feat of throwing over 300 yards with no interceptions, at least three touchdowns, and then lose in two consecutive games in regulation.Also Read: Packers vs Lions: Breaking Down the Key Moments from Today’s Game","A quarterback (QB) is a position in gridiron football in which play is made by members of the offensive side of the ball.

Border Gavaskar Trophy: When the Monkeygate scandal rocked India-Australia cricket relations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/border-gavaskar-trophy-when-the-monkeygate-scandal-rocked-india-australia-cricket-relations/articleshow/113416367.cms,"The role of

NEW DELHI: The Monkeygate scandal remains one of the most infamous incidents in the history of India-Australia cricket relations .The controversy triggered during the 2007-2008 Border-Gavaskar Test series, during the second Test match at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) in January 2008.The scandal arose from accusations of racial abuse involving Indian off-spinner Harbhajan Singh and Australian all-rounder Andrew Symonds During the third day of the SCG Test (January 5, 2008), Harbhajan Singh was alleged to have called Andrew Symonds a ""monkey"" during a heated on-field exchange. Symonds, the only player of Caribbean descent on the Australian team, took the term as a racial slur.Symonds had previously been targeted with monkey chants by spectators during India's 2007 tour of India, making the situation more sensitive.Match referee Mike Procter conducted a hearing after the match, where Harbhajan was found guilty of racial abuse based on the testimony of Australian players, including Symonds, Ricky Ponting, and Michael Clarke.Harbhajan was handed a three-match ban, which the Indian team strongly protested, claiming there was no conclusive evidence of a racial slur, and Harbhajan denied using any racist language.The Indian cricket board ( BCCI ) threatened to pull out of the series, alleging that Harbhajan's punishment was unfair.The Indian team refused to travel to Canberra for the next Test match until the issue was resolved. The BCCI also lodged an appeal with the ICC against Harbhajan's ban.A formal hearing was conducted later by New Zealand High Court judge John Hansen.The charge of racial abuse was downgraded to a lesser charge of using offensive language after it was found that there wasn't enough evidence to support the racial slur allegation. Harbhajan's ban was overturned, and he was fined 50% of his match fee instead.This resolution allowed the series to continue without further disruption, but there were serious repercussions of the scandal.The scandal strained relations between the Indian and Australian teams, and it led to discussions about on-field behavior and the role of sledging in cricket.Symonds was deeply affected by the scandal, and the incident contributed to his growing disenchantment with international cricket. He later admitted that the Monkeygate incident and the subsequent fallout had a lasting negative impact on his career.The controversy sparked heated reactions in both countries, with the Australian media defending Symonds and the Indian media rallying around Harbhajan Singh.The controversy led to increased scrutiny of player behavior, umpiring, and the application of the ICC's Code of Conduct, as well as efforts to prevent and manage racial issues on the cricket field.India batting legend Sachin Tendulkar 's role in the Monkeygate scandal was pivotal, as his testimony was instrumental in the eventual resolution of the controversy.Tendulkar was batting alongside Harbhajan during the infamous altercation with Symonds on the third day of the Test. As a key witness to the incident, Tendulkar's version of events held significant weight in the proceedings.Tendulkar and Harbhajan were involved in a crucial partnership when the heated exchange occurred. According to Tendulkar, Harbhajan did not use the word ""monkey"" as alleged by the Australian players. Tendulkar maintained that Harbhajan used a Hindi term - an offensive phrase in Hindi, but it is not racial.Tendulkar's testimony was critical in the second hearing led by Judge John Hansen, where the charge against Harbhajan Singh was downgraded from racial abuse to using offensive language.Tendulkar stood by Harbhajan during the proceedings, stating that while Harbhajan had responded to the Australian players' taunts, he did not use a racist term. His account directly contradicted the claims of the Australian players, including Symonds, Ricky Ponting, and Michael Clarke, who supported the allegation of racial abuse.Tendulkar, being an iconic figure in world cricket and a senior player, played a diplomatic role in calming tensions between the two teams. His influence and testimony were crucial in resolving the scandal without further damage to the India-Australia cricketing relationship.Tendulkar's support of Harbhajan, along with the Indian team management, contributed to the BCCI's strong stand against the racial abuse charge, which eventually led to the downgrading of Harbhajan's punishment.Tendulkar, in his autobiography ""Playing It My Way"", reflected on the Monkeygate incident and reiterated that Harbhajan was wrongly accused of using a racial slur. He expressed frustration with how the situation was handled but was relieved that Harbhajan's ban was overturned.Tendulkar's credibility as a cricketer and a person of high integrity was crucial in getting Harbhajan cleared of the racial abuse charge and diffusing a potentially damaging situation for both teams.","The Monkeygate scandal remains one of the most infamous incidents in the history of India-Australia cricket relations.

NEW DELHI: Indian batter Nitish Kumar Reddy , just three innings into his Test career, has consistently delivered when his team needed him the most. The young talent once again shone, emerging as the highest scorer in the first innings of the second pink-ball Test against Australia at Adelaide Oval on Friday.As India struggled against the pink ball, losing wickets at regular intervals, Nitish stood tall, coming close to a half-century before falling for 42.He impressed with his aggressive approach, including a standout moment where he launched Australian pacer Scott Boland's length ball for a stunning and unconventional six.Nitish had already made an impact in the first Test in Perth and is now continuing his excellent form. His unconventional six even left the commentator in stitches, as she drew a parallel with Rishabh Pant , who is also known for his unorthodox shot-making.Australia's Mitchell Starc claimed a career-best 6-48 to bundle out India for 180 inside two sessions of the day-night Test.India lost in-form opener Yashasvi Jaiswal to the first ball of the Test and slumped to 141-8 before Nitish's belligerent 42 took them past the 175-mark.India came into the clash riding high after a 295-run victory at the first Test in Perth, but Australia have a formidable record in Adelaide, winning all seven pink-ball Tests they have played at the venue.",Nitish Kumar Reddy scores 42 in India's first innings of second pink-ball Test against Australia at Adelaide Oval.

India vs Australia: How pink ball is different

We can get back in the game with a few tweaks: Ryan ten Doeschate

NEW DELHI: Australian fast bowler Mitchell Starc reflected on a highly successful opening day for Australia in the Pink-ball Test , highlighting the team's strong performance with both ball and bat.Starc, who delivered an impressive spell taking 6 wickets for 48 runs, played a key role in bowling out India for 180. Australia capitalized on this momentum, finishing the day at 86/1.Also See: IND vs AUS Live 2nd Day Starc emphasized the team's effective execution after the initial hour and expressed satisfaction with the day's overall outcome.""Yeah, a very good first day for us with the ball, I think. After that first hour, I think we were pretty bang on. So, yeah, nice way to start the Test, but a nice day one for us. It's a good way to finish the day, or good day all up,"" said Starc during the press-conference.Starc's early dismissal of Indian opener Yashasvi Jaiswal set a positive tone for Australia. Despite acknowledging Jaiswal's potential, Starc remained cautious about the challenges ahead in the second innings.""He (Jaiswal) had a good Test match last week. So, yeah, nice to get him early. And then we'll have to work on him in the second innings, I guess so,"" said Starc.He also praised teammates Nathan McSweeney and Marnus Labuschagne for their resilience against India's bowling attack under the challenging conditions of the third session.""Arguably the hardest time to bat is that third session with the brand new pink ball. To finish the day one down, particularly from Marnus and McSweeney there to fight through that and obviously sustain pressure from a quality bowling attack... and to come out the other end with a chance to go on tomorrow. It was fantastic from them. So, yeah, very pleased from there,"" he added.Highlighting the evolution of Test cricket, Starc attributed changes in the game to the influence of T20 cricket and the emergence of young, fearless cricketers from the Indian Premier League.""Some of these guys come up, grow up through IPL cricket and there's no fear or there's the expectation to be very good from the get-go and they're quality players from the time they get into international cricket no matter what their age is,"" he concluded.""Whether that's T20 cricket or coming into Test cricket or no-fear cricket from the next generation, I've been around long enough to see it change a little bit. And yeah, whether it's less fear or just a bit more confidence when you start into international cricket. You'll have to ask those batters but I'm sure it's exciting to watch.""","Australian fast bowler Mitchell Starc reflects on successful opening day. Starc took 6 wickets for 48 runs as India were bowled out for 180. Australia finished the day at 86/1, with Nathan McSweeney and Marnus Labuschagne unbeaten.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116052881,imgsize-50718,width-400,resizemode-4/116052881.jpg"

NEW DELHI: England batter Zak Crawley achieved a remarkable Test record by smashing a six in the opening over against New Zealand in Wellington.After New Zealand's captain Tom Latham elected to field first, Crawley aimed for a quick start whilst trying to find his rhythm. Facing Tim Southee in the first over, he initially got runs through a thick inside edge towards the leg side off the first delivery.Following two runs off the subsequent delivery, Crawley waited for his next scoring chance on Southee's final ball. He struck it powerfully straight back over the bowler, managing sufficient height to clear the long-off boundary for six.The over yielded 10 runs for England and marked a significant milestone for Crawley.This feat marks only the third instance in Test cricket history where a six was scored in the opening over.The previous two instances occurred in the same over when West Indies' Chris Gayle struck Sohag Gazi for two sixes during a Test match against Bangladesh match in 2012.Notably, as Gazi bowled spin, Crawley became the first batsman to hit a six off a pace bowler in the first over of a Test innings.",Zak Crawley hits a six in the opening over against New Zealand in Wellington.

Day two of the second Test between South Africa and Sri Lanka at St George's Park , Gqeberha, delivered a dramatic moment when Sri Lankan pacer Lahiru Kumara broke Kagiso Rabada 's bat with a searing delivery.South Africa, opting to bat first, posted a formidable total of 358, with Ryan Rickelton (101) and Kyle Verreynne (105*) scoring vital centuries.Also See: India vs Australia Score Batting at No. 10, Rabada contributed a crucial 23 runs off 40 balls, striking five boundaries. His partnership of 56 runs with Verreynne for the ninth wicket frustrated the Sri Lankan bowlers and added vital lower-order runs to the hosts' tally.The incident that stole the spotlight occurred in the 90th over of the innings. Kumara, delivering with pace and precision, bowled a hard-length delivery off the seam. Rabada, attempting a forward defensive shot, saw the ball hit high on the bat just below the handle. The impact was so forceful that it broke the bat, leaving the handle and blade hanging by a thread. Rabada instinctively released his bottom hand to soften the blow, but the damage was done, providing a rare and memorable visual spectacle.Kumara, who ended the innings with figures of 4/79, showcased his ability to trouble even the tailenders with his fiery spells. Rabada's defiance was eventually ended by Asitha Fernando, who clean bowled him to break the resilient ninth-wicket stand.The incident highlighted the fierce competition in the match, with South Africa holding the upper hand after their disciplined batting effort.","Sri Lanka's Lahiru Kumara broke Kagiso Rabada's bat with a searing delivery.

We can get back in the game with a few tweaks: Ryan ten Doeschate

India couldn't make much of their decision to bat first after winning the toss in the second Test against Australia in Adelaide, which is a day-night match played with the pink ball. But Australia may still rue one decision they didn't take during India's first innings on Friday, which folded up for just 180.Other than all-rounder Nitish Kumar Reddy 's counter-attacking 42 off 54 balls, only opener KL Rahul (37) and Shubman Gill (31) got starts that they couldn't convert into a significant knock. However, if it was not for Reddy's knock in the lower middle-order and Ashwin's run-a-ball 22, India might have folded up for under 150.Also See: India vs Australia Live Score Reddy came in to bat after India slipped from 69 for 1 to 87 for five and then lost partner Rishabh Pant (21), when Ashwin came out to join him. But before that, when on zero, Reddy was lucky to survive an lbw shout against Scott Boland that Australia didn't review.The 21-year-old Reddy had the Boland delivery hitting him on the pads, seemingly in front of the stumps; but the Australia captain Pat Cummins, after consulting wicketkeeper Alex Carey, chose to not ask for the review as they thought the ball in all likelihood hit the bat first. The 'Virtual Eye' later showed the ball had missed the bat and hit Reddy on both the pads, which produced two sounds.The review would have given Boland another wicket, and more importantly dismissed Reddy without scoring. Instead, India benefited and Reddy added 42 crucial runs, which included 3 fours and 3 sixes, to India's score.In a Test match where runs are at a premium, Reddy's knock might end up as the differentiator, like it happened with his knock of 41 in India's total of 150 in the first innings of the Perth Test, after which the visitors bowled out Australia for 104 to take a first-innings lead.But the Aussies are in a much better position as they head into the second day in Adelaide.After losing opener Usman Khawaja (13) early, Nathan McSweeny (38*) and Marnus Labuschagne (20*) guided the hosts to 86 for 1 at stumps, trailing by 94 runs.",All-rounder Nitish Kumar Reddy scored 42 off 54 balls for India.

Parsons wants the NFL to get its act together when it comes to running quarterbacks

Micah Parsons: Go Even Harder | Dallas Cowboys 2024

Concern over quarterback sliding rules has resurfaced in the NFL after Houston Texans linebacker Azeez Al-Shaair was suspended for a late hit on Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence, triggering criticism from players including Micah Parsons and Jahlani Tavai. Parsons pointed out how quarterbacks exploit the flexibility of sliding to gain unfair advantages, adding that the likes of Patrick Mahomes are known for so-called ""fake-slide"" tactics.Dallas Cowboys linebacker Micah Parsons is calling for the NFL to improve rules protecting quarterbacks, as they are being exploited by defensive players. Defensive players can receive harsh penalties and ejections for hitting a QB while they're running out of bounds or sliding. QBs have been known to fake end plays to burst back into game speed. Speaking with reporters on Thursday, Parsons called for change.“I just think the NFL should do a better job clearing up the gray area,” Parsons said. “If a quarterback acts like he’s going out of bounds, he should go out of bounds, that’s where you should mark him at. If he’s acting like he’s going to slide, that’s where you should mark him at. Because at that point, it’s the contact issue.”Parsons pointed specifically to Kansas City quarterback Patrick Mahomes. “You see a lot of guys taking advantage and getting extra yards off that. Mahomes wins games off that. We can’t act like these aren’t game-changing opportunities and plays that they’re extending drives on,” Parsons said. “You just never know. There’s so many mobile quarterbacks in the NFL right now.”The league could be more proactive in preventing aggressive plays, but the line between aggression and trickery is blurry. It's unclear when a move is a hesitation step or an indication of a player going out of bounds. A rule similar to the NBA's flopping ban could help, but it would put another judgement call on officials. Parsons's solution does suggest that if a person is playing for the slide or sideline, their play is dead. However, elite offensive minds like Mahomes will probably continue working to make their next move had the NFL implemented such a rule.Patrick Mahomes addressed criticism by defending his decision-making process while sliding. ""I'm just playing football at the end of the day,"" Mahomes explained, emphasizing he doesn't aim to put defenders in jeopardy. He acknowledged, however, the challenges defenders face. ""99% of guys are not trying to hurt anybody,"" Mahomes concluded.Also Read: “Shut the f–k up”: Packers coach Matt LeFleur got into a heated argument with a Lions fan and appeared to cuss him out The NFL values player safety, especially for quarterbacks, but the vagueness surrounding sliding rules makes it difficult to play for defenders. Players like Parsons are calling for clearer guidelines to ensure fairness while still maintaining safety as the league tries to balance offensive advantages with defensive integrity.","Dallas Cowboys linebacker Micah Parsons is calling for the NFL to improve rules protecting quarterbacks.

Unnikrishnan's efforts.

THRISSUR: Their faces are a study in concentration worthy of a Liren-Gukesh standoff in Singapore though the setting couldn't be more different. Or more distant.Two men, one with greying hair and salt-and-pepper beard, and the other much younger, in a lungi, square off under an awning below a palm tree as a crowd hovering around them anxiously awaits their next moves. It's a mid-day scene typical of Marottichal , Kerala's picture-postcard ""chess village"" nestled in the foothills of Thrissur district, where chess is not a pastime but an obsession, where more than 4,000 of the village's 6,000 inhabitants play the game with considerable proficiency and passion.The villagers here, young and old, men and women, the municipality sweeper and local mudhalali (wealthy landowner), play whenever they have time-in paddy fields during afternoon siestas, during school recess, in wayside tea shops. The black-and-white board is laid out, the cheap plastic kings and rooks taken out like some precious relics, and it's game on.It was not always like this at Marottichal. Chess mania here started because of a group of people led by C Unnikrishnan . In the seventies, Marotichal used to be a haven for alcoholics and gamblers. Seeing his friend and neighbours being wasted by the bottle, Unnikrishnan set about winning converts to chess. There was a movement called ""Yuva Chetana"" to reduce the influence of liquor. Led by Father Jails Chettupuzhakkaran, a Catholic priest, Unnikrishnan became active in that movement. Initially, he made little headway, but soon his perseverance saw Marottichal grow addicted to the chessboard.Inspired by the story, Mumbai-based award winning filmmaker Kabir Khurana has made a film, 'The Pawn of Marottichal"", in which six residents of the chess village make a guest appearance. ""The Pawn of Marottichal"" isn't just a film, it's a metaphor for life, resilience, and transformation, says Khurana.Marottichal's fame as chess village grew when Chess Olympiad was held in Chennai in 2022; World Chess Federation found it fit to send associate grandmaster Deepasikha March here. ""We had then conducted a chess tournament by enlisting participation of over 1,000 players at one place,"" said Unnikrishnan.","More than 4,000 of the village's 6,000 inhabitants play the game with considerable proficiency and passion.

India vs Australia, Day 1 Adelaide Test: Rohit, Kohli disappoint as visitors dance to Starc's tunes

Mohammed Siraj 's 10th over of the first innings against Australia on Day 1 of the second Test could land him in hot waters. The India seamer had a throw at Marnus Labuschagne in frustration even as the Aussie batter pulled away following a disruption near the sight screen.Also See: IND vs AUS Live Score The decision to throw the ball near the batter goes against ICC 's rules and he could be penalised on conclusion of the second Test in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy at Adelaide Oval .During the incident in the 25th over of the Australian innings, a spectator carrying a long beer-snake walked past the sight-screen as Siraj was about to bowl. Labuschagne, understandably, withdrew from his stance.Siraj reacted to the distraction by throwing the ball at the stumps. The ball missed the stumps and the batter as well.As per ICC Code of Conduct, Siraj is in breach of the rules. As per clause 2.9, Siraj was supposedly guilty of: “throwing a ball (or any other item of cricket equipment such as a water bottle) at or near a Player, Player Support Personnel, Umpire, Match Referee or any other third person in an inappropriate and/or dangerous manner during an International Match”.The clause clarifies that it does not prevent a fielder or bowler from returning the ball to the stumps normally or throwing it at the stumps or a teammate during a run-out attempt. “This offence will not prohibit a fielder or bowler from returning the ball to the stumps in the normal fashion, or from throwing the ball at the stumps or to a teammate when attempting a run out,” says the official rulebook.The officials will consider various factors when evaluating such incidents. These factors are outlined in the clause.“(i) the context of the particular situation, including, without limitation, whether the action was deliberate, reckless, negligent, and/or avoidable; (ii) whether the ball/object struck the other person; (iii) the speed at which the ball/object was thrown; and (iv) the distance from which the ball/object was thrown”.While the ball did not hit Labuschagne, Siraj’s action could be seen as deliberate, reckless, negligent, or avoidable. The match referee will make the final decision on any potential penalty.If Siraj is found guilty, he is likely to be charged with a Level 1 offence .Earlier in the day, India opted to bat first after winning the toss in the day-night Test and were bundled out for 180.Mitchell Starc began the match dramatically, taking a wicket with the first ball. He became the second bowler to start three different Test matches with a wicket, trapping Yashasvi Jaiswal leg-before-wicket KL Rahul and Shubman Gill then built a partnership of 69 runs.

Key Moments from Lions vs Packers game



Detroit Lions' Defense Shows Grit

Jared Goff's Clutch Performance

Lions Rally Behind Goff, Johnson

The Detroit Lions clinched their playoff berth with a thrilling 34-31 victory over the Green Bay Packers on Thursday Night Football. This marks their second consecutive postseason appearance, ending a nearly two-decade drought dating back to the 1994-95 season. The match kept fans on edge until the final moments, with roaring cheers echoing through the stadium as the Lions held their ground in the nail-biting conclusion. Here's the top moments from the game:The Detroit Lions have shown commendable spirit, even with a defense that seems to be depleted. First, they were without key players like Joshua Paschal, Levi Onwuzurike, and D.J. Reader, and then they lost Alim McNeill in the early second half when he suffered a head injury. With over 18 players on the injured list, Pat O'Connor raised the bar by rewarding himself with laudable career best 37 snaps in a standout manner. Brian Branch's leaving afterward was like quite a test of that unit yet again. The four touchdowns scored against Detroit -- two of which were on short fields after offensive mistakes - the defense forced critical stops through penalties and near penalties to allow the offense to finish the stop-and-deal win.Jared Goff led the Detroit Lions to the game and towards an inch-thicker layer of glory. His clutch throws on the fourth down were among the greatest. He found Tim Patrick twice in the end zone, including a go-ahead touchdown in the fourth quarter. While he did throw an interception, his overall brilliance propelled the Lions to a hard-fought win.Interesting comeback by Detroit against the Green Bay Packers and a shining leader in quarterback Jared Goff and offensive coordinator Ben Johnson. The Lions had a thoroughly impressive first half, but their lead was dwindling, as the Packers opened the second half by scoring touchdowns on the first two drives. The momentum seemed to be turning after the interception for the Packers, but Johnson really coordinated a safe, measured drive to culminate in a score.Also Read: Detroit Lions beat Packers 34-31 in high-stakes divisional clash, clinching playoff spot The Lions stayed true to their guns, calling for aggressive fourth down the next time around, but the attempt didn't pay off. Nevertheless Goff and Johnson seemed to take it in their stride and then released the team on another seventeen scoring drive to lock up the victory. Standout performances came from wide receiver Tim Patrick, who had two absolutely crucial touchdowns. Despite an early penalty, Dan Skipper filling in for injured Taylor Decker had a great performance. This Lion win was just another demonstration of their confidence and that of their coaching staff in their swashbuckling play.","The Detroit Lions clinched their playoff berth with a thrilling 34-31 victory over the Green Bay Packers on Thursday Night Football.

NEW DELHI: Former India head coach John Wright has shared the fascinating story of how India's premier fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah was discovered by the Mumbai Indians (MI) over a decade ago. Bumrah, now the No. 1 Test bowler, recently led India to their second T20 World Cup victory and is dominating the Australian batters in the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy .Wright first spotted Bumrah in 2013 during a domestic T20 match in Ahmedabad, where the pacer represented Gujarat against Mumbai. ""I saw this kid with an unusual action trying to bowl 12 consecutive yorkers. I thought, 'Bloody hell, I've never seen that before.' And he was quick,"" Wright recalled in an interview with The Times.Also See: IND vs AUS Live Score Intrigued, Wright sought insight from Gujarat's captain, Parthiv Patel . ""Parthiv said, 'That's Boom.' We signed him straight away; back then, you didn't have to go through an auction,"" Wright revealed.To test Bumrah's skills, Wright ensured the young bowler bowled to Sachin Tendulkar during practice sessions. Tendulkar, known for his impeccable technique, was impressed. ""After the session, Sachin came to me and said, 'John, who is that kid? He's really hard to pick up.' That moment felt like a triumph,"" Wright said.Despite his promising start, Bumrah faced challenges in his early seasons, playing only a handful of matches in 2013 and 2014 as he honed his craft. ""People forget that he didn't play much initially. It wasn't an overnight success,"" Wright noted.Bumrah's perseverance paid off, and by 2014 he became a key figure for MI, contributing to their five IPL titles. His unique bowling action, precision, and composure under pressure have cemented his status as one of cricket's most formidable bowlers.Wright's role in Bumrah's rise underscores the Mumbai Indians' exceptional talent-scouting system and the patience required to nurture raw talent. ""He's a great kid and very clever,"" Wright said of his star find.Bumrah's story is a testament to how opportunity, guidance, and hard work can lead to extraordinary achievements.",Jasprit Bumrah was discovered by the Mumbai Indians over a decade ago.

You could see it in under-fire Pat Cummins’ return to new-ball duties. You could see it in the recalled, 35-year-old Scott Boland’s nagging lengths. You could see it in the precocious Nitish Kumar Reddy’s flailing against the tide as India’s wickets kept tumbling.You could see it in Jasprit Bumrah’s heated exchanges with Marnus Labuschagne, as he fought to keep his place in the team. You could see it in Siraj’s fury as a drunk Aussie fan carrying an impressive beer snake interrupted the game. You could see it in Virat Kohli and Rishabh Pant’s constant chirping, a serious, coordinated attempt at unsettling the Aussies in the middle.Bizarrely, you could even see it when the lights went out at the stadium and South Australia’s minister for infrastructure immediately tweeted, “I can confirm there was no lack of power supply.”So, who turned the lights out?! This Test is where the stakes are rising. Soon there will be no second chances for the team which slips up. This is no scripted drama but real pressure. This is Test cricket, every tiny moment is part of a larger tapestry. When it all comes together well, there is no format quite just like it.

Ashwin earned a recall over Washington Sundar, but we don’t know why yet.“This team doesn’t need the coaches to go into the dressing room and tell them why they have to fight,” India’s assistant coach Ryan Ten Doeschate said, refuting notions that India was on the back foot in this Test.The ever-smiling Starc said on the Jaiswal dismissal: “Nice to sneak one past. He had a good Test match but that was last week. We’ll have to work on him (again) in the second innings.”With that one ball, Starc demolished notions that this ageing Aussie team had gone ‘too soft’, or that it lacked the fight. Wasn’t it Jaiswal who told the veteran seamer in Perth that he was “coming too slow”? India pacers struggled to control the pink ball under lights.Does Starc know where they fell short?“I’m not their bowling coach,” he offered.","India and Australia kept Test cricket’s flag flying high here as the series acquired an edgy tone.

England's Gus Atkinson produced a sensational hat-trick on Saturday, dismantling New Zealand's lower order and setting the tone for a dominant performance on day two of the second Test in Wellington.Atkinson's stunning feat came in the morning session, making him the first England bowler in seven years to claim a Test hat-trick. He bowled Nathan Smith for 14, had Matt Henry caught behind, and trapped Tim Southee LBW in successive deliveries, leaving New Zealand all out for 125.Also See: IND vs AUS Live Cricket Score Atkinson finished with figures of 4/31, sharing the spoils with fellow pacer Brydon Carse , who took 4/46.New Zealand resumed on 86/5 but could only add 39 runs in the first 40 minutes of play. Carse removed both overnight batters, bowling Tom Blundell for 16 and trapping nightwatchman Will O'Rourke LBW for a 26-ball duck. The Kiwi tail had no answer to Atkinson's accuracy and pace.With a commanding first-innings lead of 155, England's batters further tightened their grip on the match.

Duckett raced to 39 not out, while Bethell, intent on erasing his first-innings disappointment, contributed an unbeaten 34. England reached 82/1 at the break, extending their lead to a formidable 237 runs.Atkinson's hat-trick not only highlighted his growing stature in Test cricket but also shifted the momentum firmly in England's favour.

NEW DELHI: World chess number one Magnus Carlsen has delivered a stark assessment of the ongoing World Chess Championship match between India’s D Gukesh and defending champion Ding Liren .Reflecting on the state of the match after the ninth game, Carlsen, five-time world champion, remarked, “I think we have finally arrived at a moment when Gukesh is not a favourite in this match anymore.

India vs Australia: How pink ball is different

India start the second Test vs Australia with confidence

NEW DELHI: Sri Lanka batter Pathum Nissanka 's resilient knock of 89 runs played a pivotal role in Sri Lanka's fightback against South Africa on the second day of the second Test at St George's Park.Despite being dropped early in his innings, Nissanka capitalized on the opportunity and led Sri Lanka's response to South Africa's first-inning total of 358.Nissanka's innings was characterized by his ability to blunt South Africa's hostile seam attack, forming crucial partnerships with Dimuth Karunaratne and Dinesh Chandimal His 109-run stand with Chandimal for the second wicket laid the foundation for Sri Lanka's strong position at the end of the day's play, giving the Lankans some much-needed hope.While Nissanka missed out on a well-deserved century, being dismissed by Keshav Maharaj for 89, his contribution was instrumental in Sri Lanka reaching 242-3 at stumps, trailing South Africa by 116 runs.Earlier in the day, Kyle Verreynne 's counterattacking century propelled South Africa's first-inning total to 358 all out.Verreynne's aggressive batting, coupled with valuable contributions from the lower order, allowed South Africa to extend their innings and set a challenging target for Sri Lanka.Sri Lanka will aim to erase the deficit and establish a lead on a surface that appears conducive to batting on Day 3 of the encounter.The performances of Angelo Mathews and Kamindu Mendes, who remained unbeaten at the close of play, will be crucial in determining the outcome of this must-win Test for both teams in their pursuit of the World Test Championship final.","Pathum Nissanka played a pivotal role in Sri Lanka's fightback against South Africa.

India assistant coach explains Ashwin's inclusion over Washington Sundar for pink-ball Test,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-in-australia/india-assistant-coach-explains-ashwins-inclusion-over-washington-sundar-for-pink-ball-test/articleshow/116052529.cms,"(AP Photo)

We can get back in the game with a few tweaks: Ryan ten Doeschate

India's assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate explained the decision to select Ravichandran Ashwin over Washington Sundar for the second Test in Adelaide. The team believed Ashwin's experience and pink-ball Test record made him a more potent option on the Adelaide Oval surface.Australia finished the first day strongly, reaching 86/1 after dismissing India for 180. This marked a significant turnaround after their heavy defeat in the series opener at Perth.Ten Doeschate acknowledged Sundar's consistent performance since joining the team. He pointed out Sundar's contributions during the New Zealand series. The decision to prioritize batting depth influenced the selection for the Adelaide Test.""Yeah, Washy hasn't put a foot wrong since he's come into the fold, halfway through that New Zealand series... I guess the thinking going into the last Test, we wanted to strengthen the batting,"" ten Doeschate said at the post-day press conference.""And given what we saw of Nitish in the first Test, we kind of thought we'd go with what we perceived to be the guys bowling the best spin at the moment. And we feel Ash is more likely to get wickets in these conditions.""""When you get the confidence of Nitish batting at 7, it doesn't really matter with Ash batting at 8. And that was the thinking. Not much to choose between them. And we just thought that Ash would be slightly more effective on this wicket,"" he added.Despite Australia's substantial lead, ten Doeschate remained optimistic about India's chances. He highlighted the team's fighting spirit and ability to stage comebacks, as demonstrated in Perth.""I know that the scores look like there is a big gap between the two teams but we still feel we are in the game and with a few tweaks tomorrow (Saturday), we can get back in the game.""Ten Doeschate emphasized the team's inherent resilience and desire to perform well. He expressed confidence in their ability to turn the match around.""This team doesn't need the coaches to go into the dressing room and say we need to fight. The guys understand that implicitly and it's obviously a very proud team who wants to come here and do well.""We feel slightly behind the game now but there certainly won't be any letting up and certainly won't be any surrendering. There certainly is a little bit of swing and a little bit of seam still there. So we're pretty confident we can still turn it around.""He reiterated the team's determination, drawing parallels to their comeback in the Perth Test. He dismissed the notion of surrender.""At Perth, we got bowled out for 150 and still we got back into that game. This is a proud team and the players want to come here and do well. We may be slightly behind in the game now but there certainly won't be any surrendering.""Addressing the question of limited pink-ball experience, ten Doeschate acknowledged the format's unique challenges. He emphasized the team's efforts to adapt during the preparation week.""I just think it's the nature of it. If you're going to bring the pink ball into it, it's obviously great for the crowds. It's a little bit different for the players and we try to use the week as best we can to help them to adapt to the small differences.""I don't think there are huge differences and I certainly don't think there's anything to read into about how the guys performed today.He attributed the cluster of wickets to the nature of pink-ball cricket and Mitchell Starc's effective bowling. He highlighted the need to learn from the first innings performance.He added that things happen a bit faster with the pink ball.""Things happen in clumps, we lost wickets in clumps, which we wanted to avoid. I also thought that Mitchell's (Starc) stock ball was very good and there are lessons to be learnt from that first innings. We will look at how we can play better in the second innings.""Ten Doeschate praised the 21-year-old all-rounder Reddy for his resilient innings on the first day. He acknowledged Reddy's significant contributions in both Perth and Adelaide.""We are so chuffed with him. From the prep week in Perth, where he looked like he still needed to figure things out, the way he worked in Perth and the game plans he implemented in Perth, to get crucial runs there, I think to get us to 150 in that first game was amazing.""Just the way he's gone about his work here. It's obviously the first pink ball game he's playing in. There's still a little bit of work to do. He's very raw. But for a young kid, a 21-year-old, to come out like that and play three innings of the quality he has, it's super exciting.""There's obviously a chat about Washy not playing. But he's done everything a young player could do in a very short space of time. And we think he's got a very high ceiling.""Ten Doeschate outlined India's strategy for the second day, emphasizing an aggressive approach in the first session while keeping the overall match situation in mind.""I think we'll go as hard as we can in the morning but be slightly conscious of what the rest of the day looks like and what we need to do to get back into the game.""","Australia finished the first day strongly, reaching 86/1 after dismissing India for 180. This marked a significant turnaround after their heavy defeat in the series opener at Perth. The team believed Ravichandran Ashwin's experience and pink-ball Test record made him a more potent option.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116052768,imgsize-31218,width-400,resizemode-4/116052768.jpg"

England dominated the first day of the second Test against New Zealand in Wellington. Harry Brook 's century and a late flurry of wickets put the visitors in a commanding position.New Zealand finished the day at 86-5, trailing England's first innings total of 280. Brydon Carse's dismissal of Kane Williamson just before stumps was a significant blow for the hosts. Tom Blundell and nightwatchman Will O'Rourke were at the crease at the close of play, with New Zealand facing an uphill battle.The first day's play was fast-paced, mirroring the tempo of the first Test in Christchurch, which England won convincingly.Harry Brook's impressive 123 off 115 balls was the cornerstone of England's innings. He continued his excellent form from the first Test, where his 171 was instrumental in England's victory.England found themselves in early trouble at 43-4 after being asked to bat on a green Basin Reserve pitch. Brook's innings proved to be a rescue act.Brook rated this century as his ""favourite"" among his eight Test hundreds. This is a notable statement, considering his 317 against Pakistan in Multan.Brook's aggressive approach, charging down the pitch to disrupt the New Zealand bowlers, proved highly effective.""Just the circumstances really. The pitch was doing quite a bit, seaming and swinging, and I put my attacking mode on, really took it to them.""""In the situation of the game, and the way I played, I felt I was really putting them under a lot of pressure.""New Zealand's top order struggled against the pace and bounce of the England attack in the final session.Devon Conway was the first to fall, caught behind off Gus Atkinson for 11. Tom Latham was then bowled by Ben Stokes for 17.Rachin Ravindra was caught by a diving Carse at close quarters off Chris Woakes for three.Carse then dismissed the dangerous Kane Williamson, caught by Ollie Pope for 37. This wicket was a crucial moment in the day's play. Daryl Mitchell edged Carse to Pope, leaving New Zealand reeling at 86-5. Carse finished the day with figures of 2-28.Williamson had a fortunate escape earlier in his innings when he was bowled by a no-ball from Carse.Brook and Ollie Pope's 174-run partnership for the fifth wicket was the turning point of England's innings. Their counter-attacking approach rescued England from a precarious position.The partnership echoed their 151-run stand in the first Test, which also played a vital role in England's victory.Brook's innings included five sixes and 11 fours. He was eventually run out on the last ball of the second session.Brook took responsibility for his dismissal, attributing it to a misjudgment in calling for a tight single.Nathan Smith, who took 4-86 for New Zealand, praised Brook's talent and described him as a rising star.""He's in that crop of new young cricketers -- him, Rachin (Ravindra) and the guy from India (Yashasvi Jaiswal) -- put those guys in the same category.""""He's world-class and today he was keen to take the game on and it paid off for him. He played some ridiculous shots so full credit to him.""Will O'Rourke dismissed Pope and Stokes in the second session before Smith wrapped up the tail after tea. O'Rourke finished with figures of 3-49.New Zealand's catching, which was a concern in the first Test, was much improved. They took three sharp catches in the opening overs.Matt Henry dismissed Ben Duckett and Zak Crawley early on. Duckett was caught by a diving Latham at second slip for a duck, while Crawley was bowled for 17.Smith had Jacob Bethell and Joe Root caught behind. Mitchell took a sharp catch at first slip to dismiss Root. Bethell scored 16, while Root managed only 3.","England dominate first day of second Test against New Zealand in Wellington. Harry Brook scores 123 in England's first innings total of 280. New Zealand end the day at 86-5, trailing England's total.

India start the second Test vs Australia with confidence

NEW DELHI: The opening day of the second Test between India and Australia at Adelaide Oval on Friday was marked by an unusual and frustrating interruption — a floodlight failure that halted play twice in quick succession during Australia’s first innings.The incident caused the stadium to be plunged into darkness in the final session of the day, leaving players and fans alike puzzled.The disruption came at a pivotal moment during India’s bowling attack, with pacer Harshit Rana bowling at the time, as witnessed in a video that has since gone viral across social media platforms.As the lights flickered off, he appeared visibly frustrated, with his rhythm completely broken by the delay.After a brief pause, the match resumed, but the floodlight failure had already sparked a frenzy on social media, where fans couldn’t resist commenting on the strange turn of events.One user humorously referred to the situation as a ""Karachi feels in Adelaide"" moment, drawing comparisons to similar lighting issues witnessed in the past during matches in Pakistan.The incident quickly went viral, with memes and jokes flooding X (formerly Twitter), making light of the bizarre interruptions.Many pointed out the striking similarity to past instances of chaos due to malfunctioning floodlights, adding to the fun of the moment.Despite the disruptions, the match continued, with Australia’s performance at stumps leaving them trailing India by 94 runs.At the close of Day 1, Australia’s score read 86/1, with Marnus Labuschagne (20*) and Nathan McSweeney (38*) at the crease.India had posted 180 all out in their first innings, with Mitchell Starc causing most of the damage, taking six wickets for 48 runs.The day ended with both teams left to reflect on a rather eventful evening, one that would surely be remembered for more than just the cricket played on the field.","A floodlight failure halted play twice in quick succession during Australia's first innings.

NEW DELHI: The third season of the International League T20 ( ILT20 ) is set to commence on January 11, 2023, in Dubai. The tournament has gained a reputation for its competitiveness and serves as a platform for UAE players to develop their skills.One of the standout players preparing for the new season is West Indies batter Nicholas Pooran , who led MI Emirates to the title in the previous edition.Pooran is determined to make an impact once again and is hopeful of retaining the title with his team.“It's nice to be back for the third season of the ILT20. We're really looking forward to this season. We're hoping to do our best again this year and try to retain the title, but there's a lot of hard work ahead for me and the team to make that happen,” said Pooran.“Each year, I feel the quality of the tournament keeps improving. The ILT20 is doing a better job every single year. I think competitiveness is important and it feels like international cricket with nine overseas players and two UAE guys,” he added.Pooran also recognized the ILT20's crucial role in nurturing cricketing talent in the UAE, providing local players with the opportunity to learn from some of the best in the business.“It's obviously challenging. Every year, every competition brings new challenges. Going into this season, preparation begins over the Christmas period. I'm working on getting my body back in shape, hitting a lot of balls, and getting my mind in the right place. When January comes, hopefully, I'll have some luck on my side. You play each game on its merit—every game is a new opportunity, and it's about doing what the team needs. So, let's see how the new season goes,” Pooran opined.Last season, Pooran was the second-highest run-scorer, amassing 354 runs at an impressive average of 50.57 and a strike rate of 170.Another standout performer from MI Emirates was UAE's Muhammad Waseem , who finished as the fourth-highest run-scorer in the tournament.Pooran praised Waseem's aggressive batting and consistency, saying, ""There are a lot of talented players in the UAE. I've played with Waseem over the years, and he has been incredible right from when he got his chance. He seized that opportunity, and he's been brilliant for us with MI in both seasons. He's one of my favourites, for sure. I hope he continues to do great things for himself and his family.""As the new season approaches, Pooran is focused on preparing himself physically and mentally, working on his fitness and spending time in the nets.“We have passionate fans, not just here but in India and across the world. Hopefully, we can keep putting smiles on their faces and bring more titles to them,” concluded the West Indies cricketer.","The third season of the International League T20 ( ILT20 ) is set to commence on January 11, 2023, in Dubai.

Mitchell Starc scalps six

KL Rahul promises, perishes

Nitish Kumar Reddy spunk continues

India fail to make the most of twilight

Much like the first day of the opening Test, the second Test also witnessed a wicket-ravaged start in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy . If the first Test had 17 wickets fall on Day 1 in Perth, the day-night Test in Adelaide accounted for 11 wickets on Friday. 10 of those 11 wickets belonged to India who lost their last nine wickets for 111 runs. At the other end, they lost a wicket on the first ball of the contest.Once looking at reaching 200-250 runs, India were dismissed for 180 and led by 94 runs at close with the Aussies reaching 86/1 at stumps. Mitchell Starc claimed a career-best 6/48 and was the lynchpin behind India's collapse inside two sessions. With the new pink ball in hand, Starc struck first ball to send Yashasvi Jaiswal packing and his massive roar made clear how much they fancied that wicket. Jaiswal had struck a match-changing 161 runs in Perth to put the game beyond Australia's reach.Just when KL Rahul and Shubman Gill looked to be getting into the groove of things, Starc returned to end the 69-run stand with KL guiding the ball to Nathan McSweeney at gully. Next over, Virat Kohli 's indicisiveness got the better of him as well to become Starc's third.Starc dismissed R Ashwin for 22 and bowled Harshit Rana in the same over to complete his five-wicket haul - his first against India in Test cricket.With backs against the wall, Nitish Kumar Reddy tried to go into the attack but was done in by the extra pace from Starc.KL Rahul opened the batting for India after being promoted to the spot in the first Test in Rohit Sharma 's absence. He took his time to get underway and rode on plenty of luck. The right-hander, on nought at the time, was dismissed off Scott Boland on a no-ball and then was let go of by Usman Khawaja in the same over.When he got going, he looked in good touch and was careful in his approach - not going after ones that were outside the off stump and not succumbing to the pressure applied by the Aussie quicks.Not for the first time in the series, KL Rahul was guilty of reacting late - this time getting the bat to a rising Starc delivery and was caught in the gully region.It is also not the first time he's been unable to make a positive start count. The 32-year-old has played 94 innings and been dismissed in under-25 runs on 57 occasions. When he's gone past that mark, which he did in Adelaide, he's been unable to convert that into fifties or century on 13 of 37 instances or 35% of the times.Nitish Kumar Reddy continued to make his mark in just his second Test match. After 41 and 38* in Perth, the 21-year-old maintained that scoring spunk in Adelaide even though he was getting his first test of the pink ball.With wickets falling on the other side and the Aussie quicks dominating the proceedings, Nitish played fire with fire, hitting three sixes. One such maximum was an audicious reverse scoop off Scott Boland that brought out a smile from Jasprit Bumrah at the other end and a sheepish grin from the Visakhapatnam-born player.Like Perth, Nitish top-scored in the first innings for India and didn't retreat into a shell. Maybe that is something for the rest of the batting lineup to consider.India bowled 33 overs in the final session but were only able to show one wicket off it. Bumrah, Mohammad Siraj and Harshit Rana were pumped, aggressive, beat the bat plenty of times and swung the ball around beautifully but were guilty of not targeting the stumps enough.In Perth, where India took seven Australian wickets on the opening day, they largely bowled wicket-to-wicket. On Day 1 at Perth, India bowlers bowled 31% on the stumps and just 10.9% balls were outside off. Result? 7/65. Today, meanwhile, they bowled only 20.3% of the deliveries at stumps and 21.3% were outside off. Not so surprisingly, the result was 1/86.",Mitchell Starc takes career-best 6/48 on Day 1 of second Test in Adelaide. India lose their last nine wickets for 111 runs to be bowled out for 180.

NEW DELHI: Jasprit Bumrah achieved a remarkable feat by becoming the first bowler to take 50 Test wickets in 2024. The star Indian pacer reached this feat during the first innings of the pink-ball Test against Australia at Adelaide Oval on Friday.Celebrating his 31st birthday, Bumrah struck to dismiss Usman Khawaja for his 50th wicket, who was caught at first slip by captain Rohit Sharma.In the current World Test Championship cycle, Jasprit Bumrah ranks fourth on the wicket-takers list with 54 dismissals.
