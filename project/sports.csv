Eyeing an entry in Tamil Nadu

A 'natural alliance'

Caste arithmetic

What next?

NEW DELHI: Once upon a time, the Jayalalithaa-led AIADMK pulled the plug on a vulnerable Atal Bihari Vajpayee government at the Centre. The withdrawal of support in 1999 triggered the NDA's collapse after a no-confidence motion, forcing midterm Lok Sabha elections. For the BJP, it was not merely a political setback but a stinging lesson in the fragility of coalition politics.By any measure, the 1999 episode could be read as a betrayal. And yet, nearly three decades on, history appears to be folding in on itself.With the Tamil Nadu Assembly elections just months away, the BJP has formally sealed an alliance with the AIADMK, now led by former chief minister and party general secretary Edappadi K Palaniswami (EPS). The objective is unmistakable: to build a formidable front aimed at unseating the incumbent DMK government under chief minister M K Stalin From 1999 to 2026, the relationship between the BJP and the AIADMK has followed a familiar cycle – alliance, rupture, and reunion. Despite repeated breakups, political compulsions have ensured that the two parties keep finding their way back to each other.While the BJP and AIADMK share a long history of alliances, the relationship has rarely been smooth. It has unravelled abruptly more than once, exposing deep mistrust beneath the surface.The most dramatic rupture came in 1999, when Jayalalithaa withdrew support to the Vajpayee government, leading to its collapse by a single vote.Yet, within a few years, the two parties were back together. That cycle has repeated itself multiple times since then – most recently after the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, when they fought separately, only to return to the same negotiating table ahead of the 2026 assembly polls.The story of BJP-AIADMK ties is therefore less about ideology and more about arithmetic – a relationship driven by necessity.In the 1998 Lok Sabha elections, which paved the way for BJP stalwart Atal Bihari Vajpayee to become prime minister, the BJP extended a conciliatory hand to the Jayalalithaa-led AIADMK. The partnership, however, proved short-lived. Within a year, the AIADMK withdrew its support from the NDA, bringing down the vulnerable Vajpayee-led multiparty government.The rupture came against the backdrop of multiple corruption cases against Jayalalithaa and her fraught relationship with the DMK. The Supreme Court dealt a blow to her legal strategy by upholding the constitution of special courts and rejecting attempts to transfer the cases back to regular courts. This judicial setback hardened her political stance, culminating in the withdrawal of support from the Centre.In a dramatic turn, the rival DMK, led by veteran Dravidian leader M Karunanidhi, stepped in to extend support to the Vajpayee government, which went on to complete a full five-year term.Months ahead of the 2004 Lok Sabha elections, the DMK severed ties with the BJP-led NDA. The saffron party then turned once again to the Jayalalithaa-led AIADMK, forging a fresh alliance in Tamil Nadu. The experiment, however, yielded little electoral dividend, with the BJP failing to win a single seat in the state.Nationally, the NDA’s “India Shining” campaign lost its sheen, paving the way for the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance to return to power at the Centre, with Manmohan Singh taking over as prime minister.In May 2004, then BJP president M Venkaiah Naidu told reporters in Chennai that the alliance with the AIADMK had been forged specifically for the elections—by then already over—signifying the largely tactical nature of the tie-up.Following the death of veteran politician and AIADMK supremo J Jayalalithaa in late 2016, the party that had ruled Tamil Nadu for decades was plunged into intense factionalism. A bitter succession battle unfolded, with multiple claimants emerging in the post-Amma era, including the Sasikala family, O Panneerselvam and Edappadi K Palaniswami, who eventually consolidated his position and now heads the party.During this period, while a formal alliance was absent, the AIADMK began extending policy-based support to the Narendra Modi-led government at the Centre.The relationship eventually culminated in an electoral alliance for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. The experiment, however, ended in a rout, with the AIADMK-BJP combine losing 39 of the 40 Lok Sabha seats in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry.Despite the 2019 debacle, the AIADMK-BJP alliance continued into the 2021 Assembly polls. The result was another defeat: AIADMK won just 66 seats, BJP managed four, and the DMK-Congress alliance stormed back to power under Stalin.The results suggested that the alliance helped the BJP gain a foothold but did little for the AIADMK.By 2022, the BJP contested local body polls alone. Ties finally snapped in 2023 after the BJP’s then state chief K Annamalai made controversial remarks on Jayalalithaa, triggering outrage within the AIADMK.Two years after their split, the BJP and AIADMK formally came together again in 2025, announcing that the NDA would contest the upcoming Assembly elections under the leadership of EPS.Once again, political necessity trumped past bitterness.For much of the past year, negotiations between the BJP and the AIADMK have been anything but decisive. The EPS-led AIADMK has repeatedly vacillated, weighing and re-weighing the costs and benefits of embracing the BJP as a partner to take on what is widely seen as a strong and entrenched Stalin-led DMK.Despite the prolonged uncertainty, the deal now appears almost final. All indications suggest that the two parties are set to formally revive the NDA alliance in Tamil Nadu just ahead of the polls.As the election drumbeat grows louder, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, undoubtedly the BJP’s most potent electoral face over the past decade, is scheduled to visit Madurai in the last week of February. In a symbolic show of unity, Palaniswami is expected to share the stage with PM Modi at a BJP-led rally, signalling that old animosities may finally be set aside.Tamil Nadu remains one of the BJP’s weakest links – a state where the saffron party has struggled to translate its national dominance into local relevance.The BJP’s renewed push for an alliance shows a hard political reality: the Dravidian voter base cannot be wooed by outsiders. Tamil Nadu politics remains firmly anchored in grassroots Tamil parties, principally the ruling DMK and the opposition AIADMK.Amit Shah , in particular, has sharpened his attacks on the Stalin government, accusing it of being “the most corrupt in the country” and of undermining Hindu values. His rhetoric often positions the AIADMK as a “natural ally,” a party that straddles the line between secular Dravidian politics and a softer form of Hindu assertion.The BJP’s immediate agenda is not necessarily to dominate but to prevent vote fragmentation that would otherwise benefit the DMK-Congress alliance.The AIADMK’s hesitation is rooted in precedent. The BJP has a track record of entering alliances as a junior partner, often presenting itself as a supportive force with access to power at the Centre, only to eventually upend the balance and emerge as the dominant player.The most recent example is Bihar. Like the AIADMK, Nitish Kumar’s JD(U) has been an on-again, off-again ally of the BJP and was long regarded as the “big brother” in the state. That equation changed dramatically in November 2025, when the BJP, for the first time, emerged larger than the JD(U) in terms of seats, even while conceding the chief minister’s post to Nitish Kumar.While the BJP is still far from posing an immediate threat to the AIADMK in Tamil Nadu, the insecurity within the EPS camp is palpable.The BJP’s renewed push for an alliance shows a hard political reality: the Dravidian voter base cannot be wooed by outsiders. Tamil Nadu politics remains firmly anchored in grassroots Tamil parties, principally the ruling DMK and the opposition AIADMK.The BJP’s immediate agenda is not necessarily to dominate but to prevent vote fragmentation that would otherwise benefit the DMK-Congress alliance. Tamil Nadu is one of the few states where the BJP’s organisational presence is weaker than that of the Congress, a party that has been in steady national decline for over a decade.To rebuild a broader NDA, the BJP is reaching out to a range of regional players. T T V Dhinakaran’s AMMK is already signalling interest in joining hands, while talks are ongoing with Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) founder S Ramadoss. Former allies and breakaway factions are also being courted as part of a larger consolidation exercise.Two years after their split, the BJP and AIADMK formally came together again in 2025, announcing that the NDA would contest the upcoming Assembly elections under the leadership of EPS.In New Delhi, the AIADMK is seen as the BJP’s primary vehicle for political relevance in the southern state, a view that reflects the urgency of Amit Shah’s strategy.Calling the BJP-AIADMK tie-up a “natural alliance,” Shah argued that the outcome of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections would have been very different had the two parties contested together.“We fought together in 1998, in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, and in the 2021 assembly polls. But in 2024, we contested separately. If our vote shares are to be combined, we would have won 36 seats,” he said, adding that 2024 and 2025 had been victorious years for the BJP in several states and that the trend would repeat in Tamil Nadu and West Bengal.Tamil Nadu BJP chief Nainar Nagenthran echoed the sentiment, claiming widespread public disillusionment with the DMK government. He blamed former minister Senthil Balaji for the Karur stampede during actor-politician Vijay’s TVK rally.These public assertions are aimed at projecting confidence, yet they also underline a deeper truth: without the AIADMK, the BJP has little realistic chance of expanding in Tamil Nadu on its own.The AIADMK’s electoral strategy continues to focus on Dalits and Thevars – communities that together account for roughly one-third of the state’s electorate. The BJP, in contrast, is pursuing a broader Hindu consolidation strategy that often cuts across Tamil Nadu’s complex caste equations.The NDA could also benefit from the support of the Vanniyars, who make up around 15 per cent of the population and are largely represented by the PMK.EPS himself brings caste capital to the alliance. A Gounder, classified under the Backward Classes, he represents a community that constitutes around 7 per cent of the state’s population and is concentrated in the Kongu Nadu belt.After years of mistrust, breakups and reconciliations, both parties now appear determined to hold hands against the Stalin government.Palaniswami has called the AIADMK-BJP alliance “essential” to unseat what he terms an “anti-people” DMK government.“AIADMK will capture power with absolute majority in 2026… Never in the history of Tamil Nadu has there been such a corrupt, incompetent anti-people government,” EPS said.Amit Shah struck a similar tone, accusing the DMK of dynastic politics and corruption, and declaring that the NDA would remove the Stalin government “at all cost.”From 1999 to 2026, the BJP and AIADMK have parted ways more than once, only to reunite when elections approach. Whether this latest reunion becomes a durable partnership or another short-lived truce will ultimately be decided by the Tamil voter.","The relationship between the BJP and the AIADMK has followed a familiar cycle – alliance, rupture, and reunion.

GHAZIABAD: Three sisters, aged 16, 14 and 12, were found dead in the early hours of Wednesday after falling from the ninth floor of their apartment building in Ghaziabad, near Delhi.The girls were discovered lying next to each other on the premises of Bharat City residential complex, directly below a bedroom window of their flat. Police say all three died on the spot.A resident of the complex, Arun Kumar, told local media he witnessed the incident at around 2am while standing on his balcony in another tower.Also read: Inside the troubled Ghaziabad home: 2 marriages, wives leaving, no schooling for kids, mounting debts and more He said the eldest girl was seated on the window ledge with her back facing the compound, while the two younger girls stood in front of her, holding her tightly.“Suddenly, the girl on the window leaned back and fell. Within seconds, the other two jumped,” Kumar said. He added that he ran downstairs and repeatedly called for an ambulance, which arrived at around 3.15am.Police took the girls to hospital, where doctors declared them dead on arrival.1.45 am2.00 am3.15 amLater in the day‘Didn’t go to school, were lonely’According to investigators, the three sisters were sleeping with their mother in one room of the flat, while their father, Chetan Kumar , slept in another room with their son.“At around 1.45am, the girls woke up on the pretext of getting water,” said Nimish Patil, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Trans-Hindon). “They went instead to the puja room and locked it from inside.”Police say the girls used a plastic stool to climb up to the window. Their mother woke up and knocked on the door, asking them to open it, but received no response.Also read: ‘You made Devu like Bollywood’: Did rift over youngest sibling push 3 Korea-obsessed Ghaziabad sisters to brink? Patil said that, according to the father’s statement, when he later woke up, he found the eldest daughter lying in the compound below. The two younger girls also jumped shortly after.A police field unit later broke open the puja room door. Inside, officers found childhood photographs of the three sisters scattered across the floor, along with a mobile phone and a pocket-sized diary.Police said the girls had taken their mother’s mobile phone before entering the puja room. The phone has been sent for forensic examination.A one-page handwritten note addressed to their father was also recovered. The note contained an apology — “Sorry Papa” — and urged him to read their diary, with the words “READ NOW” written in capital letters.Police and family members say the diary offers insight into the girls’ state of mind.According to officers familiar with the investigation, the diary reveals a deep attachment to Korean popular culture, including K-pop music, television dramas and what is known as BL (boy love) content. The girls wrote that Korea had become central to their lives and expressed anger towards their father for opposing their interest.“How did you even dare to take this from us?” reads one line in the diary.Police sources say this may refer to an incident around 15 days earlier, when Kumar allegedly took away the elder daughter’s mobile phone and sold it.Police also said this could be a reference to their father Chetan Kumar, a stock trader allegedly deep in debt , taking away the elder daughter’s phone 15 days ago and selling it.He has not denied the girls’ interest in Korean culture. “They listened to Korean music, watched Korean films, dramas, web series and cartoons. They also wanted to go to Korea,” he said. “All three wanted us to accept Korean culture, but when we refused, their behaviour changed. They went into a shell and lived in their own world.”Investigators say the girls had not attended school since the Covid-19 pandemic and were not being homeschooled. They also did not play with other children in the housing society.Writings found on the wall of their room point to a sense of isolation. Phrases such as “I am very, very alone”, “My life is very very alone” and “Make me a heart of broken” were scribbled on the wall.According to police, the sisters spent nearly all their time together and appeared to have withdrawn from social life. In their diary, they referred to each other by names borrowed from television shows — Maria , Aliza and Cindy — and appeared to see themselves as living in a separate world.The diary lists 19 things the girls said their parents disapproved of, including Korean dramas and music, as well as Chinese, Japanese, Thai, American and British entertainment. They also mentioned cartoons such as Shin-chan and Doraemon, and several mobile games.“You don’t know how much we loved Korea,” the girls wrote. “The way we loved Korean actors and K-pop groups, we didn’t even love family members that much.”The diary also refers to tensions within the family involving a younger sibling, a four-year-old girl referred to as “Devu”.The sisters wrote that they wanted to introduce Devu to their interests, but that their parents objected and instead encouraged her to watch Bollywood films. This, they wrote, caused further distress.“You made her Bollywood, which we hated more than life itself,” the diary reads.There are also references to physical punishment, although it is unclear who the girls were referring to. “Did we live in this world to get beaten by you?” one line reads. “Death would be better for us than beatings.”Another passage mentions marriage, without detail. “The mention of marriage caused tension in our hearts,” the diary says.Police believe the diary may have been written by the 14-year-old sister and estimate it was penned one or two days before the incident, possibly after an argument with their father. It has been sent for forensic analysis.Police say the family’s circumstances were complex. Kumar lives with three women who are sisters and claims to have married all of them. The eldest of the three girls who died and a younger boy are from his first wife. The two younger girls who died were born to her younger sister. The four-year-old girl mentioned in the diary is the child of the youngest sister.Officers say two of Kumar’s partners left the house in May 2025, prompting him to file missing persons reports. They returned a few days later.Investigators say Kumar suffered financial losses during the Covid-19 period and took loans thereafter, adding to stress within the household.Police say there were frequent arguments in the family over the girls’ interests and lifestyle. No foul play has been suspected so far, but officers say the investigation is ongoing and forensic reports are awaited.“This is a tragic case involving children and a family under severe emotional and financial stress,” Patil said.","Three sisters, aged 16, 14 and 12, were found dead in the early hours of Wednesday after falling from the ninth floor of their apartment building in Ghaziabad, near Delhi.

NEW DELHI: A video of Pakistan fast bowler Haris Rauf has been making the rounds on social media, showing him enjoying a relaxed moment flying kites. The clip, which features Rauf alongside teammate Hasan Ali , comes amid his omission from Pakistan’s T20 World Cup 2026 squad, and quickly drew reactions from fans online.Rauf faced heavy trolling after the video surfaced, as many questioned his absence from the team.The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) named a 15-member squad that included stars like Babar Azam but left out both Rauf and wicketkeeper-batter Mohammad Rizwan.Speaking about the selection, Pakistan head coach Mike Hesson explained that Rauf had been considered but was not included due to the versatility of the chosen pace attack.“We considered Haris Rauf, Wasim Jr, and Ahmed Daniyal, but they couldn’t make it because the other three – Shaheen, Salman, and Naseem – can bowl in all three phases of the game,” Hesson said.Pakistan opened their T20 World Cup 2026 campaign with a narrow three-wicket win over the Netherlands in Colombo.Chasing 148, the Salman Agha-led side almost suffered an upset before a fielding lapse gave Faheem Ashraf a lifeline, and he guided Pakistan to victory with three balls to spare.Next up, Pakistan will face the USA on Tuesday at the Sinhalese Sports Club in Colombo, aiming to build on their hard-fought start in the tournament.Salman Ali Agha (Captain), Abrar Ahmed, Babar Azam, Faheem Ashraf, Fakhar Zaman, Khawaja Nafay (Wicketkeeper), Mohammad Nawaz, Salman Mirza, Naseem Shah, Sahibzada Farhan, Saim Ayub, Shaheen Shah Afridi, Shadab Khan, Usman Khan (Wicketkeeper), Usman Tariq.",A video of Pakistan fast bowler Haris Rauf flying kites has been making the rounds on social media.

Poll How do you feel about Washington Sundar's return to the T20I squad? Excited Indifferent Concerned about his fitness Uncertain about his performance

In a positive development for Team India, Washington Sundar is all set to join the T20I squad in Delhi ahead of the T20 World Cup fixture against Namibia on February 12. India captain Suryakumar Yadav revealed this after the win over USA in Mumbai, informing that the all-rounder is ""good. """"Washi (Washington Sundar) is joining us in Delhi. He's good. Everything is fine,"" said Surya at the post-match presentation.Sundar last played a competitive fixture nearly a month ago during the ODI series against New Zealand. The all-rounder injured himself while bowling in the first ODI in Vadodara and went on to miss the remainder of the series, and the five T20Is which followed. As TimesofIndia.com had reported on January 28, the left-hander resumed batting at the BCCI Centre of Excellence and got his workload gradually increased in the coming days.The BCCI didn't mention the exact nature of his injury but TimesofIndia.com has learnt that it was a mild fracture in addition to the side strain which delayed the return to match fitness. He even consulted Dr Dinshaw Pardiwala before checking into the Bengaluru facility and the initial few days were more about pain management and allowing the injured area to heal. Even the first batting session, which lasted around 30 minutes, was done with some tenderness around the injured rib region.""Washington Sundar underwent scans after reporting an acute onset discomfort in his lower rib area while bowling during the first ODI against New Zealand at the BCA Stadium, Vadodara, on 11 January. This was followed by an in-person consultation with an expert. He has been diagnosed with a side strain and has been advised rest for a few days, following which he will report to the BCCI Centre of Excellence (COE) for further management of his injury,"" read a BCCI statement on January 16.On the reported lines, the Indian management played the waiting game and was in no rush to replace the all-rounder from the World Cup squad. His addition is unlikely to affect the Playing XI dynamics but gives the management an interesting match-up card up their sleeve.Bumrah missed the tournament opener due to illness and even opener Abhishek didn't take the field during the second innings of the fixture vs USA. The left-hander wasn't spotted in the dugout, forcing the Indian management to assign fielding coach T Dilip to drinks duties.Abhishek was nowhere to be seen even during the post-match handshakes, and Surya later confirmed that both are still under the weather.""Bumrah, he was having high fever due to because of weather, like how Abhishek was under the weather,"" said Surya.Mohammed Siraj, however, revealed the Abhishek has an upset stomach but assured his return in the next game vs Namibia.""Everything is fine. His stomach was a little upset, so he didn’t come out to field. He’ll be back in the next match and show his magic with the bat,"" said Siraj.","Washington Sundar set to join T20I squad in Delhi ahead of T20 World Cup fixture against Namibia on February 12.

Sam Darnold and Drake Maye at the center of the online storm

On the eve of Super Bowl LX, in which the Seattle Seahawks will take on the New England Patriots, an outlandish fan theory has gone viral on social media as the NFL prepares to kick off. A league-issued image promoting their schedule from earlier this season, back in September, resurfaced recently, with several fans claiming it foreshadowed the exact matchup many months in advance. A standard piece of marketing material turned out to be the trigger for a full-blown online debate.The image in question was of one player from each of the 32 NFL teams lined up in front of Levi's Stadium, the site of the next Super Bowl. Then, it was just seen as a salute to the opening week. And now, following the Seahawks and Patriots gaining entry into the title game, fans are going back to the image and saying that it must have contained allusions to the future.This renewed interest centers on where certain players were positioned in the promotional image. Advocates of the theory note that Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold and Patriots quarterback Drake Maye appear to be positioned just right of center in the image compared to several others.Some fans think that detail is just way too perfect in its coincidence of timing, especially since both teams ultimately made it to the league's final game of the season.On X, Instagram, and TikTok, posts analyzing the graphic, circling figures, drawing lines, and claiming that the league was subtly revealing the final outcome have gone viral. This has been followed by jokes on social media that the NFL is rigged, a longstanding internet meme that the results of pro football games are predetermined.However, officials have shot down the speculation. NFL representatives said in a statement that the picture is intended simply to promote an exciting new season and not to favor any team over another. They assert that there was no effort to forecast or sway playoff outcomes. To them, the theory is just creative license on top of a basic marketing post.It is not the first time that football fans have sought the secret meaning hidden within a league graphic. We've seen similar theories in the past, particularly about the colors of the Super Bowl logos. Whenever an improbable pairing takes place, internet sleuths find 'proof' that it was secretly planned long ago.The NFL does not make preseason predictions; analysts, computer models, and betting markets do. Before the season began, Seattle and New England weren't exactly chalked in making the championship game. The playoff runs of both teams surprised many so-called experts, helping to further fuel the conspiracy theory.","A league-issued image promoting their schedule from earlier this season, back in September, resurfaced recently, with several fans claiming it foreshadowed the exact matchup many months in advance.

James Pearce Jr. and WNBA star Rickea Jackson’s latest legal drama explained

Atlanta Falcons respond as James Pearce Jr. faces serious charges following Miami arrest

Over the weekend, the Atlanta Falcons received shocking and extremely concerning news when rookie linebacker James Pearce Jr. was taken into custody in Miami-Dade County after what authorities said was a domestic altercation with Los Angeles Sparks player Rickea Jackson. According to ESPN, James Pearce Jr., a rookie with the Atlanta Falcons, was detained after allegedly getting into a domestic altercation with WNBA player Rickea Jackson.Following complaints of a domestic altercation between a man and a woman, Doral, Florida, police booked the 22-year-old NFL linebacker into the Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center on Saturday, February 7. For background, somewhere within the past year, Jackson and James announced their relationship to the world.Going forward, the arrest of WNBA players Rickea Jackson and James Pearce poses significant legal and league-wide issues. Since last year, there have been speculations that Jackson and Pearce were seeing each other. During the NFL draft, the WNBA player appeared to confirm it. When the Falcons selected Pearce at No. 26, she was with him and his family.Their relationship dates back to their time at the University of Tennessee.However, we can presume that Jackson is no longer seeing Pearce because she announced on her Snapchat last October that she is no longer in a relationship.According to TMZ Sports, Pearce and Rickea Jackson were allegedly involved in a fight in Miami when police were summoned. When the police arrived, Pearce allegedly got into his car and drove off, which sparked a pursuit.According to reports, Pearce crashed his car after eluding the cops. Two counts of aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, one case of aggravated stalking, and one offense of evading or avoiding police by using lights or sirens are the charges against him. At the time of his arrest, he had no set bond.The event has immediately generated severe concerns about Pearce's future in the NFL and clouded one of the most promising young defensive careers in the league. ESPN reports that authorities were called about a domestic dispute between a man and a woman on Saturday night and were sent out. Authorities subsequently verified that the parties were Jackson, 24, and Pearce, 22, who had admitted their connection in public last year.In a statement to the media, the Atlanta Falcons addressed the matter. The statement read:“We are aware of an incident involving James Pearce Jr. in Miami… We are in the process of gathering more information and will not have any further comment on an open legal matter at this time.”According to police, Pearce left the scene before they could stop him, which resulted in a fast-paced chase across Miami-Dade County. Pearce was arrested and sent to the Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center after he crashed his car close to Northwest 103rd Avenue and 66th Street, ending the chase.Pearce is facing serious allegations. According to jail records, the defendant faces charges of evading or escaping law enforcement, one case of aggravated stalking, and two counts of aggravated violence with a deadly weapon.Pearce allegedly hit a police officer during the pursuit, according to the authorities. The fact that no bond had been established as of Sunday highlights how serious the matter is and how far the judicial process will go.","Atlanta Falcons rookie linebacker James Pearce Jr. was taken into custody in Miami-Dade County after what authorities said was a domestic altercation with Los Angeles Sparks player Rickea Jackson.

Super Bowl LX is just a few hours away as the New England Patriots and the Seattle Seahawks gear up to face each other at Levi’s Stadium.While fans are expecting an epic match, many are also waiting for the popular Grammy winner, Bad Bunny, to take the stage during his halftime performance, days after President Donald Trump made controversial comments against him.A few days ago, in an interview with The New York Post, President Donald Trump opened up about his opinion of having Bad Bunny and Green Day perform for Super Bowl LX halftime and pregame, respectively.Shockingly, President Donald Trump said, “I’m anti-them. I think it’s a terrible choice.”He added, “All it does is sow hatred. Terrible.”As the interviewer asked if he would be attending the game like last year, President Donald Trump denied saying, “It’s just too far away. I would.

Bad Bunny: Headlining the Apple Music Super Bowl LX Halftime Show

How to watch the halftime show at Super Bowl 2026

The football is only half the story at Super Bowl 2026. The matchup between the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks has turned the Bay Area into a rolling red carpet.All week, artists, actors, billionaire owners and reality stars have been bouncing between Pier 48, Union Square, Daly City and Levi’s Stadium, setting up one of the most crowded celebrity Super Bowls in years.The headline act is halftime star Bad Bunny. Fresh off a historic Album of the Year win, he told reporters he wants to bring ""a lot of my culture"" to the Apple Music Super Bowl LX Halftime Show, while keeping the setlist under wraps.Cardi B is everywhere this week. She is headlining Michael Rubin’s Fanatics party and is rumored, per multiple reports, to be a candidate to join Bad Bunny for “I Like It” on the halftime stage. Her boyfriend, Patriots wide receiver Stefon Diggs, has already gone viral after stepping off the plane in San Francisco with a black Birkin bag, faux fur jacket and matching boots.Around the Bay, the A-list has been busy. The San Francisco Chronicle and other outlets have already spotted:On the 'expected' side, celebrity lists from Newsweek, TIME and others have circled Ben Affleck, Jeff Bezos, Kim Kardashian, Barack Obama and Jon Hamm as likely faces in suites at Levi’s.Affleck is back in Super Bowl ad rotations. Bezos remains glued to any game tied to franchise movement. Kardashian family members are tied to Fanatics promos and charity bets. Hamm has already hosted NFL Honors and fronted a Ritz campaign this week.Add in Russell Wilson and Ciara in North Beach, reality stars like Maura Higgins and U.K. influencers at sponsor events, plus NFL legends from Michael Irvin to Deion Sanders around fan fests, and the guest list looks closer to an awards show than a football game.The NFL has confirmed a tight, staged music lineup for Super Bowl LX. Reports from CBS News, league releases, and Apple Music have locked in:Bad Bunny will become the first native Spanish speaker to headline the Super Bowl halftime show. He is not cashing a monster performance check, though. As reported previously with past headliners, halftime acts are paid only a small union rate while the NFL and Apple Music cover the massive production bill. The real payoff is the global audience and the spike in streams, sales and ticket demand that usually follows.The choice has drawn backlash in some political circles, especially after Bad Bunny said “ICE out” at the Grammys. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell has repeatedly backed the pick, calling him ""one of the leading and most popular entertainers in the world"" and stressing that the league wants artists who can use the stage to bring people together.Super Bowl LX kicks off Sunday, Feb. 8, at 6:30 p.m. ET on NBC, with streaming available on Peacock. Pregame coverage rolls straight into Green Day’s opening performance and the national anthem.Bad Bunny’s halftime show will hit the stage between the second and third quarters, with Apple Music and the NFL pushing full behind-the-scenes and replay content across social platforms after the live performance.Seattle did it again. For the second time in franchise history, the Seahawks are Super Bowl champions after a 29-13 win over the New England Patriots in Super Bowl LX.Seattle’s “Dark Side” defense set the tone all night, hammering Patriots QB Drake Maye with six sacks and forcing three turnovers. Derick Hall sparked the takeaway party with a third-quarter strip sack, then Uchenna Nwosu and Julian Love sealed it with fourth-quarter interceptions.Kenneth Walker III earned Super Bowl MVP and carried the offense with 135 rushing yards on 5.0 a pop. Sam Darnold stayed clean, finishing 19-of-38 for 202 yards and a touchdown without a turnover. New England’s lone push came on a 35-yard Mack Hollins TD that made it 19-7, but the Patriots never got closer after the next pair of picks.","Super Bowl LX kicks off Sunday, Feb. 8, at 6:30 p.m. ET on NBC, with streaming available on Peacock.

Game day temperatures and wind conditions at Levi’s Stadium

Assessing the risk of rain or snow disruptions in the Super Bowl venue

Santa Clara welcomes Super Bowl LX on Sunday, February 8, 2026, and at least as much concern will be around the weather as the play on the field. The Bay Area is expected to be pretty calm initially in the morning, and early forecasts indicate fans heading to Levi’s Stadium will find very mild and mostly quiet conditions. Noting mild temperatures for the time of year, light winds, and a very low chance of rain in the hours before kick-off, meteorologists are predicting favorable conditions.There is never a sure thing in long-range outlooks, but as of right now, graphs show a stable pattern settling in over Northern California for the big weekend. That's encouraging news for players, fans, and the thousands expected to attend outdoor tailgates and festivities. However, February weather can be fickle, and forecasters were keeping an eye on more Pacific storm systems that could impact the area in the days leading up to the game.The weather for the championship matchup in Santa Clara should be pleasant, making it a good day for fans in attendance. Forecast guidance has afternoon highs around the mid-60s Fahrenheit, which is just about normal for early February here in the South Bay.Temperatures will slowly drop down to the upper-40s and low-50s by the end of the evening and the sunset, so light jackets or sweatshirts will be needed for anyone sticking around through the final whistle.The weather also won't be a dominant factor, as the winds aren't expected to be a significant factor. For today, light breezes are expected to remain below 10mph for the most part. Cohorts would experience little effect on passing games, kicking precision, or tailgates outside the building. There may be some slow-moving patchy fog in the inland valleys in the morning, but it isn't likely to last around the stadium area by kickoff, with mostly clear to partly cloudy skies for much of the event.To summarize, we can note that the current temperature of Santa Clara is roughly around 8-10°C, and the weather condition is partly sunny.As many fans are traveling to experience the Super Bowl in person, one of the questions is whether winter storms will affect your Super Bowl experience. In fact, the likelihood of snow in Santa Clara itself may be zero, as the city is at such a low elevation that freezing temperatures are almost nonexistent. It does look like rain chances on game day are also pretty low based on the current forecast pattern, with dry conditions favored through the weekend.The bigger issue is with some of the weather systems from earlier this week. When the storms are particularly strong, they can deliver drenching rainfall to the Bay Area and copious snow in the Sierra Nevada. A change in the timing of such a system could mean travel slowdowns for visitors flying into California or driving over mountain passes. But for now, forecasters say any strong storm activity will either be to the north of the region or won't arrive until after the Super Bowl has wrapped up.","The weather for the championship matchup in Santa Clara should be pleasant, making it a good day for fans in attendance.

Who Benefits More?

Thecontinue to operate with urgency in 2026, and. has become one of the most discussed names in trade conversations. The Utah Jazz only acquired the two-way big man on February 3 in a major deal with Memphis, but league chatter suggests Golden State explored serious talks before shifting focus elsewhere. Even after the deadline, the idea of a future Warriors-Jazz deal has not fully disappeared.Jackson is under contract with Utah through the 2028-29 season after signing a four-year extension worth about $205 million in 2025. His cap hit for 2025-26 sits near $35 million. Utah gave up three future first-round picks along with several rotation players to acquire him, so the team is not expected to move him unless the return is substantial. For now, he is part of a frontcourt built around Lauri Markkanen and Walker Kessler.If Golden State Warriors revisits the idea, the offer would likely center on young players and draft picks.• Jaren Jackson Jr. (F/C, 26, $35M cap hit)• John Konchar (G, 29, $6.2M, 3-and-D wing)• Jonathan Kuminga (PF, 23, projected $20M-25M, UFA after 2026)• Moses Moody (SG/SF, 23, two-way wing on $11.5M)• Brandin Podziemski (SG, 22, $3.7M, starting guard)• 2026 first-round pick (top-14 protected)• 2029 first-round pick (unprotected)The structure reflects the type of package typically required for an established two-way big in his prime.Golden State’s timeline is clear. Stephen Curry, now 37, still produces at a high level, and Draymond Green remains central to the defense. What the roster lacks is a reliable interior defender who can also space the floor.Jaren Jackson offers both.He averages about 2.2 blocks for his career and is recording roughly 1.7 blocks and 1.5 steals this season. He shoots around 34-35% from three and makes about two per game, which fits Golden State’s spacing. At 26, he also provides a bridge between the current core and the next phase of the roster.A lineup featuring Curry, Podziemski, Jimmy Butler, Green, and Jackson would add length and defensive range without sacrificing shooting.Utah Jazz invested heavily to get Jackson, so any deal would need to strengthen the roster long term.Kuminga brings scoring potential and athleticism at 23. Moody and Podziemski are young perimeter players on manageable contracts who fit a team focused on shooting and defense. Two first-round picks would help recover some of the draft capital already spent.Moving Jackson would also remove about $35 million from the payroll, giving the front office more flexibility if it decides to reshape the roster around Markkanen and Kessler.• Immediate improvement in rim protection• A frontcourt player who can shoot• A move that supports another title push• Loss of three young rotation players• Large salary commitment• Possible overlap with Kristaps Porziņģis and Quinten Post• Adds multiple young players with upside• Restores draft flexibility• Creates financial room• Gives up a rare two-way big• Risks negative reaction after his strong start, including a 22-point debut• Injury history remains a concernIf the deal is judged strictly on assets, Utah could benefit by turning one star into three young players and two first-round picks while improving financial flexibility. Jackson’s injury history adds another layer to that calculation.Also read: NBA trade rumors: Los Angeles Lakers potentially eyeing $80 million Houston Rockets star to for iconic trio with LeBron James and Luka Doncic For Golden State, the trade would be a direct bet on the present.

Super Bowl stakes rise as Stefon Diggs links Patriots victory to potential engagement with Cardi B



Super Bowl LX engagement buzz surrounding Cardi B and Stefon Diggs has added a personal edge to football’s biggest night. The question is simple and timely. Will a championship win also unlock a life changing decision for the New England Patriots wide receiver and the global rap star he has been dating for over a year?That curiosity gained traction on Monday when Stefon Diggs faced reporters ahead of Super Bowl LX. What began as routine media availability quickly shifted into relationship territory, blending pop culture with playoff pressure. Diggs did not dodge the moment. Instead, he leaned into it with a grin and just enough honesty to keep fans guessing.The speculation started when a reporter asked Diggs if Cardi B would be “getting her ring” should the Patriots lift the Lombardi Trophy. Diggs paused, smiled, and replied, “It’s on the agenda, maybe, right? Right?” He then grounded the moment with competitive focus, adding, “I gotta get mine first.” The message was clear. Football comes first, but the conversation is not off limits.The relationship itself has unfolded under constant public attention. Cardi B and Diggs were first seen together in February 2025, according to TMZ. By May, their appearance courtside at a New York Knicks game fueled dating chatter. In June, Cardi confirmed the romance with a yacht photo on Instagram, later deleted but never forgotten by fans.Rumors swirled again in summer when Diggs vanished from her feed. Those whispers ended in September during a CBS Mornings interview, where Cardi confirmed they were still together and shared bigger news. “I’m excited, I’m happy. I feel like I’m in a good space,” she said. “I feel very strong, I feel very powerful that I’m doing all this work — but I’m doing all this work while I’m creating a baby.”She later expanded on their shared mindset. “I feel like we’re really great and one of the best at what we do, and me and him think the same way — like, ‘Yeah, we’re one of the greatest, but what’s next?’ We have to do it again, all the time. We’re never comfortable, we just wanna keep doing it.”Their child arrived in November, marking a fresh chapter. “Starting over is never easy but it’s been so worth it!” Cardi B wrote on Instagram. “I brought new music and a new album to the world! A new baby into my world.”For Diggs, Super Bowl LX already represents a career milestone after stops in Minnesota, Buffalo, and Houston before joining New England in 2025. Whether it also becomes a personal turning point remains unanswered. Sunday night may deliver more than one ring, or it may simply set the stage for what comes next.","New England Patriots wide receiver Stefon Diggs has been dating rapper Cardi B for over a year.

Is the Avengers: Doomsday trailer going to be featured at Super Bowl LX? Here’s what we know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/is-the-avengers-doomsday-trailer-going-to-be-featured-at-super-bowl-lx-heres-what-we-know/articleshow/128075815.cms,"Marvel Studios will reportedly skip Super Bowl 2026, ending a 16-year tradition of debuting MCU trailers during the big game. That means fans should not expect new footage from Avengers: Doomsday or other 2026 projects. Rising ad costs and recent teaser releases may have influenced the decision, marking a notable shift in Marvel’s long-standing Super Bowl marketing strategy.

Why Marvel is sitting out Super Bowl LX

Marvel Studios has quietly stepped away from one of its most reliable marketing stages. After dominating Super Bowl ad breaks for over a decade, the studio will reportedly skip Super Bowl LX in 2026. That decision means fans hoping for a first big-screen tease of Avengers: Doomsday during the NFL’s biggest night may be left staring at their screens in disappointment.For 16 years, Marvel turned the Super Bowl into a launchpad for its cinematic universe. From early Iron Man spots to massive ensemble reveals, the franchise made the big game part of its promotional DNA. Now, with several high-profile projects lined up for 2026, the absence feels louder than ever.According to industry reports, Marvel Studios won't show any new movies or Disney+ series during the broadcast in 2026. That includes highly anticipated titles like Avengers: Doomsday, Spider-Man: Brand New Day, and streaming hits that are coming back. The break shows that the studio is changing its strategy, since it used to see the Super Bowl as very important.One major factor may be cost. A 30-second Super Bowl commercial now reportedly sits near the $10 million mark, a sharp jump from previous years.For a film like Avengers: Doomsday, which is scheduled for release on May 01, 2026, the studio may feel its recent marketing push already built enough early momentum. December and January delivered multiple teasers, giving fans plenty to dissect..The bigger surprise is Spider-Man: Brand New Day. A previous Spider-Man installment debuted footage during its Super Bowl release year, so many expected history to repeat itself. Instead, Marvel appears to be saving its cards for a later reveal.Interestingly, Marvel will not be alone in its absence. DC Studios is also expected to skip the game broadcast, choosing alternative platforms for promotion.Super Bowl LX will still feature major blockbuster trailers. But for the first time in years, the Marvel logo may not flash across millions of screens on football’s biggest night. For longtime fans, that break in tradition may feel like the real headline.","Marvel Studios won't show any new movies or Disney+ series during the broadcast in 2026. That includes highly anticipated titles like Avengers: Doomsday, Spider-Man: Brand New Day, and streaming hits that are coming back. Rising ad costs and recent teaser releases may have influenced the decision, marking a notable shift in Marvel’s long-standing Super Bowl marketing strategy.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128075815,imgsize-29040,width-400,resizemode-4/128075815.jpg"
Why did Patriots star Mack Hollins arrive at Super Bowl LX in shackles and a prison uniform?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/why-did-patriots-star-mack-hollins-arrive-at-super-bowl-lx-in-shackles-and-a-prison-uniform/articleshow/128090973.cms,"Patriots wide receiver Mack Hollins stunned fans by arriving at Super Bowl LX in a prison-style uniform, shackled at the wrists and ankles, and barefoot. Known for rejecting shoes and embracing unconventional habits, Hollins says “everyone should be barefoot” and believes it strengthens the body. His bold entrance once again spotlighted his unique philosophy and unapologetic individuality.

Mack Hollins divides fans with shackled Super Bowl LX arrival at Levi’s Stadium

Mack Hollins never arrives quietly, and Super Bowl LX was no exception. As cameras lined the entrance at Levi’s Stadium, the New England Patriots wide receiver stepped out wearing maroon prison-style scrubs with “Warriors” printed across the back. His wrists and ankles were shackled. He wore a face covering. And, true to form, he was completely barefoot.The striking entrance instantly set social media buzzing. Hollins has built a reputation for bold fashion choices and an even bolder outlook on life. Yet this Super Bowl appearance felt especially theatrical. While teammates opted for tailored suits and designer sneakers, Hollins leaned fully into symbolism, performance, and personal philosophy.Hollins did not slip on shoes once he reached the field. He stayed barefoot during pregame warmups, later changing into a jersey linked to coach Mike Vrabel’s high school roots. For longtime followers, the shoeless look was not surprising. Hollins has long championed going without footwear, even in freezing temperatures.In a 2023 interview, he explained his stance clearly. He believes ""everyone should be barefoot.""Addressing hygiene concerns, he added, ""It's so funny that people look at me like that because shoes are definitely dirtier than feet.""His reasoning goes deeper than comfort. Speaking to Sports Illustrated, Hollins outlined what he sees as physical advantages. ""Strength of the foot, strength of the knee, strength of the ankle,"" he said. ""Free electrons from the body, so you feel more grounded. You're cleaner. You move faster. You strengthen the whole body, so your knee doesn't have to take so much pressure, and your ankle is more developed.""He even compared footwear to equipment. ""Shoes are a tool,"" he said. ""You wouldn't walk around with a hammer just because you might nail something every once in a while. Why walk around in shoes just because you might step on something every once in a while?""For Hollins, individuality matters. ""Going with no shoes, having wild hair, eating with my hands instead of utensils, that type of stuff, that’s not bothering anybody. That’s who I am,"" he once said. And on football’s biggest night, he made sure everyone saw exactly who that is.","Mack Hollins stunned fans by arriving at Super Bowl LX in a prison-style uniform, shackled at the wrists and ankles, and barefoot.

Mike Darnold tells students why being a proud patriotic American and dependable person defines his identity



Sam Darnold's father Mike Darnold's plumber story reveals where the Seattle Seahawks quarterback’s foundation truly comes from. While fans track Sam’s progress in the NFL, his father’s lifelong career in the skilled trades explains the values that shaped him long before draft night. At a recent Lowe’s Foundation event, Mike Darnold shared his journey as a working tradesman, offering insight into the discipline and pride that defined his family life.Mike Darnold described himself as a “medical gas plumber for nearly 30 years,” a role that placed him inside hospitals and medical facilities where precision mattered every day. He explained, “As I look back on my experience as a tradesperson, I found an extreme source of pride in providing products and services to countless hospitals and medical facilities over the years.” The statement was not about nostalgia. It was about dignity in work that often goes unseen.At the same event, he shared the habits that defined his career. He told students he took pride in “my dependability – being early, willing to stay late, doing whatever it took to finish the job right.” He then tied that ethic directly to Sam’s football path. “This mindset made me a valuable contributor for my company and customers, which became an example to both of our children, as we witnessed in Sam’s athletic career over the years,” Mike Darnold said.“Again, I wish you all the same success and rewards that I’ve experienced in the trades. It’s a journey well worth traveling.”According to People, Sam Darnold has had “unwavering support from his parents,” Michael and Chris Darnold. Mike often highlights that pride publicly, posting about community service and family moments. In January, he wrote, “I am a proud patriotic American and blessed to be a guest for Pendleton Change of Command with fellow Rotarians.”That grounding mattered as Sam’s career tested patience. Drafted third overall by the New York Jets in 2018, he faced early struggles before stops with the Panthers, 49ers, and Vikings. He signed with Seattle in March 2025 carrying experience rather than hype. Athletic roots run deep in the family. His sister Franki played college volleyball, while his mother Chris competed at Long Beach City College before becoming a middle school physical education teacher.Chris Darnold once summed up Sam’s childhood simply. “He was so naturally gifted, it was crazy,” she told Bleacher Report in 2017. “We wanted him to be a kid and try it all. What else is a childhood for? You need to discover yourself.”","Mike Darnold worked as a medical gas plumber for nearly 30 years.

George Kittle shares injury recovery details as Seahawks and Patriots chase Super Bowl history

George Kittle has no reason to cheer on Super Bowl Sunday. The San Francisco 49ers tight end is not playing, his team is out, and the two teams in the game are rivals he does not care for at all. Kittle is in San Francisco this week with his wife, Claire, for a local event. While there, he was asked about the Super Bowl being played at Levi’s Stadium. The matchup features the Seattle Seahawks and the New England Patriots and George Kittle did not hide how he felt.“She makes me watch every Super Bowl even if I’m not in it,” George Kittle said. “I might be playing video games. I don’t know. I hope both teams lose.” That short line said everything.The comment comes after a tough end to Kittle’s season. He suffered a season-ending Achilles injury during San Francisco’s 23–19 wild-card win over the Philadelphia Eagles on January 11. The 49ers later lost to the Seahawks in the divisional round, ending their playoff run. With no team to support and still recovering, Kittle is watching the biggest game of the year from the sidelines, both on the field and emotionally.The Seahawks are trying to win their second Super Bowl title. The Patriots are chasing their first championship since the Tom Brady and Bill Belichick era ended. For George Kittle, none of that matters right now. What does matter for now is his health.During Super Bowl week, Kittle was seen using crutches. On Friday, he shared a clear update on how his recovery is going while speaking on The Pat McAfee Show.“When I’m at my house, the nice thing is my trainers are coming to me right now,” George Kittle said. “That part is really convenient. I do a lot of holds and ankle work. I have a three-inch heel lift in my boot, so I can stand and just hang out. But we are not walking yet.” He explained what comes next.“I’ll be in a shoe next week and go back and forth between a shoe and a boot,” Kittle said. “I’ll be on crutches for another two to three or four weeks. Then I’ll be moving again.”Before the injury, Kittle played 11 games this season. He finished with 57 catches, 628 receiving yards, and seven touchdowns. Despite missing time, he remained a key part of the 49ers’ offense until the injury stopped everything. For now, George Kittle is focused on healing. The Super Bowl can play on without him.",George Kittle says he has no interest in Super Bowl LX as Patriots face Seahawks in epic NFL final.

Winning one Super Bowl is hard. Winning several across many seasons is even harder. Since the Super Bowl began in 1967, thousands of NFL players have suited up, but only a small group managed to win again and again.

Kim Kardashian’s recent flight to the UK reignited attention around Kim Air, her custom Gulfstream G650ER that ranks among the most expensive private jets owned by any celebrity. The trip came amid growing reports linking (now confirmed) the reality star to Formula One icon Lewis Hamilton. It has added a fresh intrigue to an already headline driven journey. While the destination sparked interest, the aircraft itself told a deeper story about scale, privacy, and precision luxury.The jet, acquired in 2022 and later transformed through an extensive redesign. The immersive customization reflects Kardashian’s taste for restraint layered with indulgence. From materials to layout, every choice points to comfort built for long haul travel.Kim Kardashian owns a Kim Air private jet, and it’s about as luxurious as you’d expect. After purchasing a Gulfstream G650ER for a reported $95 million, she invested another $55 million into a complete overhaul to achieve a jet that mirrors her signature style.Kardashian revealed the details during an episode of The Kardashians, offering rare insight into the transformation.“Usually, planes are dark with lighter leather. Mine, I had custom, all-light wood. I had a bathroom put in the front and a bathroom put in the back. Every seat has its own phone charger,” she explained. The ceilings, seats, headrests, and baggage compartments were all trimmed in cashmere.As for restrictions are concerned, Kim banned spray tans onboard after an incident involving Kendall Jenner and requires passengers to wear Skims-branded slippers before take-off. At the same time, she customizes the onboard freezer based on guest preferences.Kardashian is rumored to be in a relationship with F1 legend Lewis Hamilton. According to reports, she flew into the UK for a private weekend that included dinner, spa time, and heavy security. A source told The Sun: “It all appeared to be very romantic.

Bill Belichick’s girlfriend Jordon Hudson stuns fans after wearing provocative Robert Kraft shirt ahead of Super Bowl LX,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/bill-belichicks-girlfriend-jordon-hudson-stuns-fans-after-wearing-provocative-robert-kraft-shirt-ahead-of-super-bowl-lx/articleshow/128089748.cms,"Bill Belichick’s GF Jordon Hudson (Getty Images)

Jordon Hudson shocking shirt and why it targeted Robert Kraft



Jordon Hudson's shocking shirt became the talk of Chapel Hill on Saturday night, and the timing could not have been louder. On the eve of Super Bowl LX, Hudson drew instant attention during North Carolina’s dramatic basketball win over Duke, not for the scoreline but for a fashion choice that landed squarely in NFL territory and reopened old New England wounds.The moment mattered because it blended sports, power, and provocation in one public setting. Hudson, the 24-year-old girlfriend of Bill Belichick, appeared courtside as the Tar Heels edged their rivals, but her outfit carried a message that extended far beyond college hoops. It pointed directly at Patriots owner Robert Kraft, just hours before his franchise prepared for the biggest game of the year.The shirt Hudson wore referenced Kraft’s February 2019 arrest on two counts of soliciting prostitution at the Orchids of Asia Day Spa in Jupiter, Florida. It was not subtle. She wore an actual Orchids of Asia Day Spa T-shirt, a detail that spread quickly online once fans identified it after the game.The choice felt calculated, especially given the history involved. Belichick coached the Patriots for 24 seasons, delivered six Super Bowl titles, and exited the organization at the start of 2024. Now at North Carolina, his first season ended with a 4-8 record, but results were often overshadowed by headlines tied to Hudson’s presence.From sideline pep talks to lingering near press conferences, her actions repeatedly became talking points around the program.Those moments never fully faded. Even in the offseason, Hudson managed to pull focus again, including an appearance at the College Football Playoff National Championship Game that fueled fresh debate. Saturday night only added to that pattern, with the shirt landing one last jab before New England faced Seattle in Super Bowl LX.The irony was hard to miss. If the Patriots lift the Lombardi Trophy on Sunday, it would mark their first championship without Belichick on the sideline. Hudson’s message, intentional or not, suggested there may be little love lost between the old power structure and the new chapter.Belichick, at least, avoided becoming the story this time. He stayed alert throughout the game, a small win after earlier viral moments at UNC. Whether he and Hudson tune in to watch his former team remains unclear. Her track record suggests neutrality is not her style.","Jordon Hudson's shirt referenced Robert Kraft's arrest on prostitution charges.

NFL’s senior vice president explains how crowd exposure helps artists

Kendrick Lamar , Rihanna , Maroon 5 , and Justin Timberlake

According to WCNC’s Megan Divers, the NFL may cover artists’ travel costs, but the league continues its tradition of not paying performers for pregame and halftime shows beyond a [minimum union-mandated fee through SAG-AFTRA], usually about $1,000 per day for rehearsals and the performance.In short, pop superstars do not reportedly receive a massive paycheck for their grand performances. Sports Illustrated reported Usher received $671 for his 2024 performance and $1,800 for the rehearsal. According to the July 2025 Wrapbook story, the most recent SAG day rate for basic theatrical agreements was $1,246 a day.The Athletic reported that Bad Bunny is not getting much for headlining the Super Bowl LX halftime show, but superstars do it for exposure.“When you have an opportunity as an artist to stand on a stage and reach 250 million people at one time,” Jon Barker, the NFL’s senior vice president and global head of major events, told The Athletic’s Jayna Bardahl. “And that’s not counting the addition of social and streaming and the ability for people to go back and re-watch, I think that it is one of the most important stages in live entertainment.When they join us and become part of the halftime show, I think [artists] recognize what the halftime show is and being a part of it.And I think that resonates very strongly with the artists. That’s certainly the feedback we’ve heard year after year after years with artists.”Rihanna’s 2023 performance reportedly drew a record 121 million viewers. ELLE’s Moriel Mizrahi Finder and Alyssa Bailey reported that Rihanna’s halftime show led to a 640% boost in music sales.Rolling Stone reported that 2025 halftime headliner Kendrick Lamar saw a 430% jump in Spotify streams for “Not Like Us” and a 175% boost in overall Spotify streams after the performance.Billboard reported that Maroon 5’s 2019 halftime performance saw a 434% increase in sales, while Justin Timberlake’s 2018 Super Bowl show gained him a 534% sales boost.An NFL spokesperson told Forbes in 2016: ""We do not pay the artists. We cover expenses and production costs.""","The NFL does not pay performers for pregame and halftime shows beyond a minimum union-mandated fee through SAG-AFTRA.

Stafford’s MVP Win Defined by Heartfelt ""MVD"" Tribute from His Four Daughters

""To my four beautiful daughters... you guys are my 'why',""

The 5-Point Controversy: Was Drake Maye Robbed?

The ""Sam Monson"" Factor:

Value vs. Volume: Stafford had the ""volume"" (46 TDs), but Maye had the ""value,"" leading a rebuilding Patriots team to a 14-3 record with a significantly weaker supporting cast.

Efficiency: Maye led the league in completion percentage (72%) and passer rating (113.5).



The ""Super Bowl"" Irony: Fans were quick to point out that while Stafford was accepting a trophy, Maye was busy preparing to play in Super Bowl LX this Sunday.



Public and Celebrity Reaction: A Split Decision

The Legends: Tom Brady and Steve Young have been vocal in their support of Stafford, calling it a ""lifetime achievement"" win for a veteran who has finally earned his flowers.



The New Guard: Younger fans and analysts argue that the MVP award should go to the ""best player that year,"" not the player with the best story.

The Meme Wars: Today, February 7th, is Stafford's 38th birthday. Memes are already circulating of him ""stealing"" the trophy as a birthday gift from the voters.

On Thursday night at the NFL Honors, the league crowned Matthew Stafford as the MVP. But while the history books will record the 37-year-old Rams quarterback as the 2025 NFL MVP, the night was defined by a razor-thin voting margin and a surprise video that reminded everyone why he’s really playing.Before Stafford took the stage to accept his trophy, the room went quiet for a surprise video. In a clip that has since racked up millions of views, Stafford’s four daughters—Chandler, Sawyer, Hunter, and Tyler surprised their dad with a homemade tribute.They didn't talk about his league-leading 4,707 passing yards or his 46 touchdowns. Instead, they crowned him their ""MVD""—Most Valuable Dad. Stafford was visibly moved to tears, and when he finally took the stage, he was flanked by his daughters and his wife, Kelly.Stafford told the crowd. He then used the massive platform to put retirement rumors to bed, confirming he will return for the 2026 season.Despite the sentimental celebration, a storm was brewing on social media. Stafford won the award by just 5 points (366 to 361), the closest margin in 22 years.The debate centers on a single vote. Analyst Sam Monson revealed he used his first-place vote on Justin Herbert (who wasn't even a top-5 finalist).Because Maye lost by only 5 points, that one ""renegade"" vote effectively decided the race.Patriots fans and ""advanced stats"" enthusiasts are calling it a robbery, citing the following:The reaction has been a perfect reflection of the close vote:Matthew Stafford goes into the 2026 season with a Hall of Fame lock, an MVP trophy, and a title he clearly values more: Most Valuable Dad.

Will TreVeyon Henderson play tonight against the Seattle Seahawks?



The New England Patriots head into Super Bowl LX with cautious optimism surrounding running back TreVeyon Henderson, whose health has been under quiet watch following a midgame scare earlier in the postseason. The availability of Henderson is now more attached with the unit of a team and its backfield, since the team is about to play the championship match with Seattle Seahawks.Henderson has been a consistent factor to the New England offense, providing a sense of balance to the offense through his capacity to gain yards on the ground and remain engaged as a pass catcher. As Super Bowl week unfolded, attention shifted to whether he would be fully fit in time for the biggest game of the year. The answer, at least for now, appears encouraging for Patriots fans watching closely.Yes, Henderson is expected to play tonight against the Seahawks in Super Bowl LX. TreVeyon Henderson's injury concern traces back to the Patriots’ playoff game against the Houston Texans, when he went down in the second quarter after a rushing attempt. He stayed on the field briefly as medical staff evaluated him, creating visible concern on the sideline.While the exact issue was not disclosed, Henderson was able to jog off under his own power, an immediate sign that the situation may not be serious.Since that moment, the Patriots have kept details limited, but there has been no indication of a setback during Super Bowl preparations.

“I just didn’t think”: A country legend reveals the surprising reason she never did the Super Bowl halftime show,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/i-just-didnt-think-a-country-legend-reveals-the-surprising-reason-she-never-did-the-super-bowl-halftime-show/articleshow/128071821.cms,"Dolly Parton (via Getty Images)

Dolly Parton’s comments highlight how hard it is for country stars to say yes

With Super Bowl LX almost here, the halftime show is once again as much of a topic of conversation among fans as the game itself. Bad Bunny is set to headline Sunday night, and while his global fanbase is massive, not everyone is thrilled. Online chatter has grown louder around the fact that fans miss seeing country music on the Super Bowl stage.A petition with more than 128,000 signatures is even calling for George Strait to replace Bad Bunny, showing just how passionate some viewers are about bringing the genre back. However, Dolly Parton , who has been a trailblazer in the genre, has turned down the opportunity to headline the coveted halftime show multiple times. It has been over two decades since a country singer last held the spotlight.Shania Twain was the last country headliner, performing in 2003. Since then, the halftime show has shifted heavily toward more mainstream pop, hip-hop, and global crossover acts. That does not mean country stars have not been considered along the way. In fact, Dolly Parton has revealed she was asked more than once.Parton told The Hollywood Reporter in 2023, “Oh, sure,” about being offered the Super Bowl halftime show. She further stated, “I’ve been offered that many times.I couldn’t do it because of other things, or I just didn’t think I was big enough to do it, to do that big of a production. However, the country singer performed at the 2023 NFL Thanksgiving halftime show.Parton added, “When you think about those shows, those are big, big productions. I’ve never done anything with that big of a production. I don’t know if I could have. I think at the time that’s what I was thinking.” Her statement is valid since the Super Bowl halftime show is a high-pressure spectacle watched by more people than almost any live performance on earth.Still, Parton’s hesitation surprises many fans because she has always been known for big visuals, bold style, and stage presence. She also proved she can deliver a major televised moment with her Dallas Cowboys Thanksgiving halftime appearance, which drew huge attention.The renewed push for a country halftime show is not just nostalgia, as the genre is currently one of the most dominant genres in the United States, especially with streaming growth and popularity. Whether or not she ever headlines a halftime show, Parton’s comments have now reignited the conversation.","Dolly Parton has turned down the opportunity to headline the coveted halftime show multiple times.

NEW DELHI: Nepal’s fearless performance against two-time champions England in their ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2026 opener earned admiration from across the cricketing world, including high praise from former South Africa pace great Dale Steyn.In a nail-biting contest that went down to the final ball at the Wankhede Stadium on Sunday, England held their nerve to escape with a four-run win, restricting Nepal to 180/6 in response to 184/7. Watching Nepal’s courageous chase that nearly produced a historic upset, Steyn took to social media to applaud the associate nation’s rise.“Nepal, I offer my services to you if you ever need em! Up, up and UP!,” Steyn wrote, capturing the mood of a performance that pushed the former world champions to the brink.Former India allrounder also applauded Nepal's efforts.""Huge respect to Nepal. Took on one of the best teams in the world, stayed in the fight till the very last ball and showed what belief and heart can do! This is how teams grow and this is how champions rise. The cricketing world is watching!,"" Yuvraj wrote.Chasing a challenging target, Nepal began aggressively as openers Aasif Sheikh and Kushal Bhurtel scored at over ten an over against an experienced England attack.England struck back in the Power-play with Luke Wood dismissing Aasif (9), while Will Jacks produced a brilliant return catch to remove the dangerous Bhurtel.After the early setbacks, captain Rohit Paudel and Dipendra Singh Airee steadied the innings with a historic 82-run partnership that swung momentum firmly Nepal’s way. The duo took on England’s premier spinner Adil Rashid, who conceded 42 runs without a wicket, rotating strike smartly and punishing loose deliveries.England finally found relief in the 15th over when Sam Curran deceived Dipendra with a slower ball, ending a superb 44 off 29 balls that included six fours and a six. Liam Dawson then removed Paudel for a composed 39, putting England back in control.Still, Nepal refused to fade away. Lokesh Ram launched a late assault, smashing an unbeaten 39 off just 20 balls, leaving England to defend 10 runs in the final over. Curran responded with a high-quality finish, sealing a tense victory for Harry Brook’s side.Earlier, England recovered from a shaky start through half-centuries from Jacob Bethell and Brook, before Will Jacks’ explosive 39 off 18 balls lifted them to a competitive total.Despite the loss, Nepal walked off with belief, momentum, and the backing of one of cricket’s greatest fast bowlers — a sign that their rise on the world stage is being noticed.",England beat Nepal by four runs in their ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2026 opener.

Team India lands in New Delhi for T20 World Cup match

1 - Tim Seifert’s sixth Man of the Match award in T20Is is his first in T20 World Cup. His 65 off 42 balls is his maiden fifty in T20 World Cup.



183/5 - New Zealand have recorded their highest successful chase in T20 World Cup, beating the 167-5 vs England at Abu Dhabi on Nov 10, 2021.



—Stats: Rajesh Kumar

Brief Scores:

CHENNAI: The 1-4 T20I series thrashing at the hands of India might have painted New Zealand as a vulnerable unit ahead of the T20 World Cup, but it prepared them for the real battle. On Sunday morning in the MA Chidambaram Stadium, a polished and well-rounded Black Caps team arrived in force and outmanoeuvred a sturdy Afghanistan by five wickets in the Group D encounter.Even after Gulbadin Naib’s powerful 63 (35 balls; 3x4, 4x6) and Mujeeb Ur Rahman’s ferocious double-strike in the second over of their innings, New Zealand efficiently chased down the target of 183 on a new surface where it could get difficult.This win marked New Zealand’s highest successful run chase in T20 World Cup history --surpassing their previous best of 167 against England in the 2021 semifinal — with much of the credit going to opening batter Tim Seifert’s swaggering fightback of 65 off 42 balls (7x4, 3x6) and allrounder Glenn Phillips’ audacious 42 off 25 balls (7x4, 1x6). The duo delighted the 20,000-odd Sunday crowd with a clinical batting display.After mystery spinner Mujeeb, with his subtle variations, rattled the stumps of opener Finn Allen and Rachin Ravindra off successive deliveries in the second over of the chase, Phillips thwarted the hat-trick ball and joined Seifert to restore stability. Their 74-run stand for the third wicket smartly accelerated the innings while tackling Afghanistan’s spin threat head-on.Their job was made just a bit easier by Afghanistan’s decision not to play chinaman bowler Noor Ahmad — who plies his trade in IPL for Chennai Super Kings. His Chennai experience could have been vital on these conditions, but Afghanistan coach Jonathan Trott argued that the pitch is new and it would still have been alien for Noor.“We thought the cracks would produce a bit of uneven bounce, and that proved to be the case. I think the selection was right, but we didn’t bowl well enough. The seamers, unfortunately, didn’t execute as they should have. Credit to them; they put our seamers under pressure,” Trott said after the match.Seifert, the player of the match, said the conditions were tough. “It’s always nice to start the tournament with a few runs under your belt. But the main thing is we got the win. I thought the spin actually came a little bit easier than the seam. So it went my way, it’s all about the momentum and who you’re going to target throughout the innings,” said the wicketkeeper-batter.True to his words, Seifert, during his knock, particularly took a liking to left-arm medium pacer Fazalhaq Farooqi, hitting him for five of his 10 boundaries.When captain Rashid Khan entered the attack, Phillips greeted him with back-to-back boundaries to seize control. Rashid eventually had his say, in his next over, by dismissing Phillips in his next over, but Seifert continued to anchor the chase, pulling veteran spinner Mohammad Nabi for a six over square leg to bring up his half-century before adding two eye-catching boundaries to long-off and deep mid-wicket. By the time Seifert was dismissed, he had done his job, reducing the equation to a chasable 57 off 42 balls, which New Zealand did in 17.5 overs.Afghanistan 182 for 6 (Gulbadin Naib 63; Doug Ferguson 2-40) lost to New Zealand 183 for 5 (Seifert 65, Phillips 42, Mitchell 25*, Mujeeb 2-31) by five wickets",New Zealand beat Afghanistan by five wickets in their T20 World Cup opener.

Poll Do you think the India-Pakistan match will take place as scheduled on February 15? Yes, it's likely to happen. No, it will be canceled. Unsure, depends on negotiations.

MUMBAI: The chances of an India–Pakistan clash in Colombo on February 15 in the ongoing 2026 T20 World Cup brightened on Sunday, with International Cricket Council (ICC) deputy chairman Imran Khwaja flying to Lahore for a crucial meeting with senior officials of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB).At the time of filing this report, Khwaja was locked in discussions at the Gaddafi Stadium with PCB chairman Mohsin Naqvi. Bangladesh Cricket Board president Bangladesh Cricket Board chief Aminul Islam Bulbul and PCB chief operating officer Sumair Ahmed Syed were also present.“Important meetings are underway. Hopefully, there is now a big ray of hope that the India–Pakistan match will take place as scheduled,” sources tracking developments in Pakistan told TOI.Earlier, Khwaja — who has been acting as a mediator in the highly sensitive situation — was received at Lahore airport by Amir Mir, advisor to Naqvi. The ICC official is understood to have travelled with the sole objective of salvaging the marquee India–Pakistan fixture, which carries enormous commercial value for the ICC and its member boards.Both the PCB and the International Cricket Council are keen to resolve the standoff triggered by Pakistan’s proposed boycott of the high-profile contest.The meetings in Lahore are expected to be followed by a virtual ICC Board meeting late on Sunday night. Khwaja, who represents Singapore on the ICC Board as an associate member director, is regarded as one of the governing body’s most influential figures and carries voting rights. He has been formally tasked by the ICC Board to mediate and find a way out of the impasse.Bulbul is also expected to play a role in discussions aimed at persuading Pakistan to reconsider its decision to skip the Colombo fixture.Pakistan prime minister Shehbaz Sharif had earlier said that the national team would boycott the India match in solidarity with Bangladesh, who were replaced by Scotland after refusing to travel to India for their World Cup games, citing security concerns.However, the situation may now be fluid after Sri Lanka Cricket CEO Shammi Silva wrote to Naqvi, urging the PCB to call off the boycott, warning that a no-show would also result in heavy financial losses for Sri Lanka.The ICC has meanwhile sought clarity from the PCB on how the ‘Force Majeure’ clause could be invoked to justify Pakistan’s refusal to play the match after the board cited directives from its government.With the PCB now engaging in deliberations with the ICC, momentum appears to be building towards a possible resolution.The chain of events was triggered after Bangladesh pulled out of their World Cup matches in India following pacer Mustafizur Rahman being released from the Kolkata Knight Riders squad on the instructions of the BCCI.","ICC deputy chairman Imran Khwaja flies to Lahore for talks with Pakistan Cricket Board.

CHENNAI: On the eve of their T20 World Cup campaign opener against New Zealand, Afghanistan skipper Rashid Khan said his biggest dream is to see international cricket being played on Afghan soil.“To play international cricket back home is bigger than the World Cup. For me, for the team, and for every individual, that’s something more than a dream,” Rashid had said.And for the Afghan fans who travel with the team whenever they can, it will be a moment that they have cherished all their lives. On Sunday morning here, when TOI caught up with a few passionate Afghan fans from Kabul at the MA Chidambaram Stadium gallery, they spoke about the dream that they share with their skipper. Draped in either their national attire or Afghan team jersey, they never lost their voices even though New Zealand closed in on the chase of 183.“Inshallah, ek din (one day)...It will be really great. It’s a massive dream for every cricket fan back home. We want to host India for our first international match in Afghanistan because India and we are like brothers. It’s our second favourite team in the World Cup,” Jawad Ahmadi, one of the young Afghan fans, said.Afghanistan as a country has endured a lot. But their undying love for cricket is something that helps them deal with the difficulties of life. And now, with every passing day, the Afghanistan team is looking a stronger unit — their run to the semifinals of the last T20 World Cup being a case in point. “The sport back home is growing day by day. But it will take quite some time to reach the level of India. But let me tell you, we are as crazy about cricket as you guys are. We know how to celebrate, you can take a cue from us,” Ahmadi said with a smile. “But yes, overall, small steps are being taken to develop the sport and we hope to be a big and strong team in the future.”While Rashid is the current face of Afghan cricket, former skipper Mohammad Nabi is widely regarded as its torchbearer. For the fans, it’s a healthy debate, ‘who means more for Afghan cricket’?“Rashid is our hero. Back home, everyone loves Rashid Khan and the way he keeps taking the Afghanistan flag higher in cricket is great. He has helped improve facilities and has inspired so many youngsters to take up the sport, which is just wonderful,” said Jawad.His friend Abdul, a club-level cricketer, had a different view. “I took up cricket because of Nabi. Nabi is the real hero for us; he has been there from the beginning, so we admire him a lot. The way Nabi and his generation started out without many facilities and still kept going...that’s just amazing.”","Afghanistan take on New Zealand in their opening T20 World Cup match on Sunday.

Patriots lean into white-on-white superstition for Super Bowl 60

Seahawks stay in blue as throwback debate hovers over Super Bowl 60

On Feb. 8, 2026, the New England Patriots are treating their uniforms like part of the game plan. They are the home team for Super Bowl 60 at Levi’s Stadium, but they chose to wear white-on-white against the Seattle Seahawks in Santa Clara.It is not just a clean look. It is a look loaded with history. New England has built a Super Bowl resume in white, including its previous win over Seattle, while the Seahawks return in blue with their own title past tied to the opposite color.New England could have gone with its traditional home colors. Instead, the Patriots announced on Jan. 29 that they will wear white jerseys and white pants for Super Bowl 60, a full commitment to a combination that has followed them through big wins this season and in past title games.Historically, the franchise has done its best Super Bowl work in white. Across its appearances, New England has a winning record in that color and a weaker one in its darker home looks, including multiple losses to the New York Giants in blue. The last time the Patriots faced the Seahawks on this stage, during the 2014 season, they did it in white and walked away with a 28-24 win.That pattern has carried into this year. New England has gone all white in five games this season, including last week’s 10-7 AFC Championship Game win over the Denver Broncos, stacking road victories over the New Orleans Saints, Cincinnati Bengals, Baltimore Ravens, and New York Jets in the same setup.The Super Bowl version will add the league’s LX logo and a USA 250 patch, turning the familiar road look into a commemorative one without changing the core superstition.The Patriots trust what has been working. In a one-game season, they are not about to test the luck of a new combination.On the other side, Seattle will wear its blue jerseys for this Super Bowl meeting, even though its lone title came in white in Super Bowl 48. That record alone gives the uniform matchup some edge: New England is chasing another win over Seattle in white, while the Seahawks try to rewrite their own Super Bowl history in blue.The uniforms are also sitting in the middle of a larger league debate. Players and coaches around the NFL have pushed for more freedom to use alternate and throwback jerseys in the playoffs and on the Super Bowl stage. Patriots wideout DeMario “Pop” Douglas has spoken up for New England’s classic red “Pat Patriot” look, and Seahawks cornerback Devon Witherspoon has echoed the nostalgia on Seattle’s side with vintage-inspired ideas.Those jerseys stayed in the closet this week. Current rules and limits on alternates kept Super Bowl 60 locked into standard home-and-road choices, even with fans clearly willing to spend on throwbacks and players openly saying they want them. If the NFL ever relaxes those rules, nights like this one in Santa Clara will be the testing ground.For now, the story is straightforward. Seattle will try to win in blue. New England will trust its “lucky” whites again. If the Patriots lift another Lombardi in that same color, the uniform talk around this franchise will only get louder.","The New England Patriots will wear white jerseys and white pants for Super Bowl 60.

Gloria Estefan changed the language of the halftime show

Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake changed tv forever

Kendrick Lamar and Rihanna redefined modern halftime shows

The Super Bowl halftime show has slowly turned into one of the biggest moments in global entertainment. While football remains the heart of the night, millions now watch just to see what happens during those 13 minutes on stage. As Super Bowl LX approaches with Bad Bunny set to perform, it is worth looking back at the moments that shaped how halftime shows are viewed today. These performances were not just concerts. They changed rules, broke records, and reflected culture in real time.For many years, halftime shows were led by marching bands and safe performances. That pattern broke in 1991 when New Kids on the Block became the first major pop act to headline.The show included a children’s choir and songs aimed at a family audience. It was not widely praised, but it mattered.Donnie Wahlberg later told Playboy, “I don’t know how much pride I take in the actual performance. But I take pride in the fact that we were the first ones to do it.”In 1999, Gloria Estefan made history by becoming the first Spanish-language artist to headline a Super Bowl halftime show.According to ESPN, her Miami performance blended English and Spanish and reflected the city’s culture.Years later, speaking to E! News, Estefan advised Bad Bunny ahead of his halftime moment, saying, “Enjoy every second because it really goes by so fast.”Many critics still point to Prince's 2007 as the greatest halftime show ever. Performing during heavy rain, Prince closed with “Purple Rain,” creating a moment that felt unplanned and unforgettable. The Athletic later wrote that no performer before or after has matched the impact of that night.Not every moment brought praise. In 2004, Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake were involved in a wardrobe malfunction watched by more than 140 million viewers, according to The Guardian. The incident led to stricter broadcast rules and changed how live TV was handled for years.In 2025, Kendrick Lamar delivered the most-watched halftime show ever, with 133.5 million viewers, according to Billboard.Two years earlier, Rihanna stunned fans by performing an entire set while pregnant, suspended above the field. BuzzFeed News praised the show for its calm confidence and control.","The Super Bowl halftime show has slowly turned into one of the biggest moments in global entertainment.

Boston Celtics strengthen roster with strategic Nikola Vucevic trade from Chicago Bulls

Nikola Vucevic brings experience and double-double power to Boston Celtics frontcourt

During this year's NBA trade deadline, the Boston Celtics traded a number of players, but they have also added a significant player in center. Nikola Vucevic, who will miss Wednesday's game against the Houston Rockets, has joined the team. The Bulls traded him to the Celtics, who then traded Anfernee Simons from the Celtics.The Celtics made three small trades before the 3 p.m. game after obtaining big man Nikola Vucevic and a second-round pick from the Chicago Bulls in exchange for guard Anfernee Simons. They have also sent Xavier Tillman to the Charlotte Hornets, Josh Minott to the Brooklyn Nets, and Chris Boucher to the Utah Jazz.After acquiring center Nikola Vucevic from the Chicago Bulls in exchange for guard Anfernee Simons, the Boston Celtics have added some depth to their front line for the postseason run. The Celtics acquired the talented big one day before the trade deadline, giving him a change of scenery after six seasons with the Bulls.Boston's tax burden will drop significantly as a result of the shift, from approximately $39 million to $17 million. The Celtics also have additional financial flexibility as part of the transaction, which they may use to make other deals. However, despite his Tuesday trade from Chicago to Boston, Vucevic isn't nearly ready to make his Celtics debut.Moreover, there was no mention of Vucevic in Boston's injury report that Celtics reporter Noa Dalzell issued on Friday. The omission of his name suggests that he will make his Celtics debut on Friday.The seasoned center will probably replace Neemias Queta in the starting lineup after he becomes comfortable with his new squad. Vucevic will possibly have his next opportunity to play against Miami on Friday. After this deal, Boston was a little shorthanded during Wednesday's game, but the fans could see the Celtics' newest roster in action on Friday against the Heat.Vucevic, a 35-year-old in his 15th season, is one of the most reliable double-double machines when he arrives in Boston. Vucevic has averaged 18.5 points and 10.5 rebounds a game during the past ten campaigns, officially recording double-doubles in eight of them.Vucevic is now joining his fourth franchise after playing for the Bulls, Philadelphia, and Orlando. Similar to his career averages of 17.2 points and 10.4 rebounds per game, he has averaged 16.9 points and 9.0 rebounds this season.With Xavier Tillman Sr., Luka Garza, and Neemias Queta making up Boston's center rotation, Vucevic joined a frontline that was lacking in experience. He has played in 1,020 regular-season games and 16 playoff games, including 10 with the Orlando Magic in 2018-20.Additionally, he has been with Chicago for the past five and a half seasons. He is now moving to Boston, where he will start at center right away. In 48 games this season, Vucevic has averaged 16.9 points, 9.0 rebounds, and 3.8 assists.","Boston Celtics acquired center Nikola Vucevic from the Chicago Bulls in exchange for guard Anfernee Simons.

Elevated solar activity keeps auroras visible across high-latitude regions



Solar activity continues to feed the auroral system



























How aurora maps show intensity and location



Visibility can extend far beyond the oval





Solar activity remains elevated this week, shaped largely by one persistent sunspot region and the steady stream of solar material it has released. Measurements from the US Space Weather Prediction Center show continued flare activity and a disturbed solar wind passing Earth. None of it points to extreme geomagnetic storms, but it is enough to keep the upper atmosphere active. Currently, the effects primarily manifest near the poles. NOAA describes the situation as fluid rather than dramatic. Where auroras might be visible depends on timing, darkness, and whether the sky cooperates during long winter nights across the north.Auroras are expected to stay largely confined from 5th to 7th February to high-latitude regions, including Alaska, northern Canada, Greenland, and parts of Scandinavia. These places sit under the usual auroral oval and tend to respond first when Earth’s magnetic field becomes unsettled. Even modest disturbances can produce visible light there, though nothing is guaranteed. Clear skies still matter, as does darkness. Space weather can create the necessary conditions, but cloud cover or daylight can also abruptly end the spectacle.The present pattern traces back to ongoing activity from a single dominant sunspot group.Over recent days, it has produced several strong flares and several eruptions that sent charged particles outward. Some of that material has already brushed past Earth, stirring the magnetic field slightly. The effects are mild, not the kind that trigger major storms, but enough to keep energy flowing into the upper atmosphere, where auroras take shape.Forecast maps usually show auroral activity as a green oval wrapped around Earth’s magnetic pole. That shape marks where displays are most likely. When conditions become more active, the oval brightens and can shift in colour, sometimes turning red to signal stronger intensity. The same maps also show daylight areas in lighter tones, a reminder that auroras are hidden when the Sun is up. Most viewing happens after sunset or before sunrise, in the quieter edges of night.Auroras do not always need to be overhead. When displays brighten, they can sometimes be seen from far outside the main oval, appearing low along the horizon from hundreds of kilometres away. These moments are brief and depend on many small factors coming together. For now, the activity looks steady rather than expansive, keeping most auroras anchored to far northern skies, with occasional hints rather than wide-reaching displays.","Auroras expected to stay largely confined from 5th to 7th February to high- latitude regions, including Alaska, northern Canada, Greenland, and parts of Scandinavia.
