Taylor Swift Plans To Match Outfits With Travis Kelce’s Mother Donna Kelce



Travis Kelce Might Be Facing Some Pressure To Propose To Taylor Swift



It seems like the global pop star Taylor Swift and her relationship with the NFL star, Travis Kelce , is only getting stronger. Recently, a source close to the couple revealed to the Daily Mail, that whenever Taylor attends a match of her boyfriend as he plays for his team, Taylor makes sure her outfit matches Travis’ mother, Donna Kelce ’s outfit to “ensure everything aligns.”This makes sense because Taylor and Travis’ mother Donna Kelce have many a time twinned at the stadium while they cheer on Travis and his team in the NFL, the Kansas City Chiefs . Apparently, as per the source close to the couple, this move of Taylor’s has made Travis fall in love with her more since he finds this to be a beautiful gesture. The source revealed to the Daily Mail, ""Travis has always been flattered at Taylor wearing his team's colors when she attends his games and matching with his mom is something that he finds really touching.”Last month when Taylor attended the match when the Kansas City Chiefs went against the Las Vegas Raiders, she was spotted wearing a bright red sweatshirt from Louis Vuitton along with black pants. Travis’ mother Donna Kelce wore similar black pants and a black shirt with a hint of red color. While the red color was meant for the Kansas City Chiefs, fans went into a frenzy as they spotted Taylor and Donna matching their outfits.Many fans thought this was a coincidence that they both ended up matching their outfits but it looks like Taylor made sure to plan everything beforehand so that she could match with her future mother in law - a heartwarming move by the global pop star that touched both Travis, his family and their fans.While it looks like both Travis and Taylor have impressed each other’s families, as per a report, Travis’ family wants him to pop the big question to Taylor as soon as possible. Both Taylor and Travis are currently 35 years old with Travis being older than Taylor by two months. Most of Taylor’s Hollywood and music friends are either engaged or married and it seems like the pressure is getting to Taylor and Travis.Even though fans have speculated for the longest time about their engagement, apparently there is no truth to such rumours. As per a report by Daily Mail, Travis and Taylor find such engagement rumours about themselves hilarious and want to take their own time before deciding on such a big decision. Their close friends also want the fans to calm down and want the couple to take things slowly.At this moment, both Travis and Taylor are in New York City where they are spending the holiday season and are having the time of their lives with each other. As per reports, Travis is in the $50 million that Taylor owns in New York City.Also Read: Taylor Swift is a billionaire, but the necklace she wore with Travis Kelce in NYC might not be as expensive as you'd guess","Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce's relationship is only getting stronger.

Did Lita Have Multiple Affairs with Top WWE Superstars During Her Tenure as an Active Performer?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/wwe/top-stories/did-lita-have-multiple-affairs-with-top-wwe-superstars-during-her-tenure-as-an-active-performer/articleshow/116890159.cms,"Image via Getty Images and WWE

Here is a look at multiple affairs Lita had during her WWE tenure



4) Matt Hardy



3) Edge



2) Kane



1) CM Punk



Lita was not only one of the most gifted in-ring athletes of the Squared Circle but also a highly attractive female during the early 2000s in WWE. Her amazing in-ring acumen and captivating looks captured the hearts of multiple WWE stars, both onscreen and offscreen.Lita is considered one of the biggest pioneers in the history of WWE for women. Female superstars like herself and Trish Stratus redefined wrestling during an era when women did not get meaningful opportunities. Her amazing high-flying ability and personality captivated the hearts of many fans over the years.But it was not only the fans who were mesmerised by Lita. Some of the top WWE superstars got romantically involved with Lita over the years, which led to some beautiful and even unusual relationships during her tenure.During the start of her WWE career in the early 2000s, Lita was paired with Matt and Jeff Hardy, who came to be known as ‘Team Xtreme.’ Being aligned together as a team, Matt Hardy and Lita spent a lot of time together, which led to an onscreen and offscreen relationship between the two. The two popular wrestling stars were together for years; however, in 2005, their relationship came to a turbulent end as Lita began seeing another wrestler while still being with Matt Hardy.In 2005, Lita and Matt Hardy’s relationship came to an end after it was revealed that she was dating fellow WWE superstar Adam Copeland, popularly known as Edge. This led to major tensions between Edge and Matt Hardy, which was later translated into a WWE storyline and led to Matt Hardy’s return to WWE. However, despite the real-life heat between the three, the fans applauded them for their professionalism and work ethic during the storyline.During the time Matt Hardy and Lita were together, both onscreen and offscreen, they got involved in a feud with Kane, who, in the storyline, kidnapped Lita and impregnated her with his child. This led to a match between Kane and Matt, which The Big Red Machine won and earned the right to marry Lita. The ceremony was held on RAW, and despite Matt’s attempts to stop it, Kane succeeded in forcefully marrying Lita. For the next few months, both were aligned as storyline husband and wife, until Lita turned on Kane and sided with Edge, during the time when their real-life relationship had begun.The last WWE superstar that Lita reportedly dated was CM Punk in 2009. The former WWE Women’s Champion and The Best in the World. The duo were together over different time periods in their careers but eventually went their separate ways. Despite their split, Punk and Lita continue to admire each other for their contributions to the business and as a person.Also read: Who Is Lita's husband?

Did Aaron Rodgers just ‘quit’ on the Jets? Former Jets WR torches 4-time MVP for 'taking his ball and going home',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/did-aaron-rodgers-just-quit-on-the-jets-former-jets-wr-torches-4-time-mvp-for-taking-his-ball-and-going-home/articleshow/116876052.cms,"<p>Did Aaron Rodgers just call it quits on the Jets? (Photo by Kevin Sabitus/Getty Images)<br></p>

Does Rodgers even want to be in New York anymore?

undefined

Is it time for the Jets to move on?

Aaron Rodgers pulled himself out of Sunday’s blowout loss against the Bills, and it’s not sitting well with former Jets star Keyshawn Johnson. On FS1’s Speak, Johnson unloaded on the four-time MVP, accusing him of bailing on his team when things got tough.“You decide to take your ball and go home because you wasn’t getting your way,” Johnson said. The Jets were down 33-0, and according to Rodgers, he suggested to interim head coach Jeff Ulbrich that backup Tyrod Taylor should take over. By the time Taylor stepped in, the Bills had made it 40-0. Taylor led two late touchdowns, but it was meaningless cleanup work in an already disastrous game.For Johnson, Rodgers’ move was unforgivable. “What the hell is wrong with Aaron Rodgers?” Johnson continued. “You quit on your team, man.”Was this whole barrage about just one unfortunate circumstance that could have been avoided? No, not really. To Keyshawn, it felt symbolic. Johnson compared Rodgers to San Francisco linebacker De’Vondre Campbell, who refused to play earlier this season. While others on the panel argued that staying on the sideline wasn’t the same as walking off the field, Johnson didn’t budge. “He checked out,” Johnson said. “It’s the same thing. You don’t leave your team hanging like that.”This is not about one game, it was never about that. This loss dropped the Jets to 4-12, a season already torched by turmoil, including the firing of head coach Robert Saleh and GM Joe Douglas. Rodgers had hyped up the last two weeks as an ""audition"" for next year, calling them critical despite the Jets being eliminated from playoff contention. Then… this.After the game, Rodgers wasn’t exactly reassuring. “I’m going to enjoy next week and then take some mental and physical rest,” he told reporters. Not exactly the words of someone ready to lead a rebuild.Keyshawn Johnson thinks so. “I thought he was on a mission to convince them he should come back,” Johnson said. “Based on what he did yesterday, I don’t want to be nowhere near him.”The Jets took a swing by bringing in Rodgers, banking on his leadership to change the franchise’s fortunes. Instead, they’ve got a 41-year-old QB whose actions—and interceptions—are raising more questions than answers. Whether Rodgers stays or goes, the Jets’ offseason is going to be messy. Again.","Aaron Rodgers pulled himself out of Sunday's blowout loss against the Bills. Former Jets star Keyshawn Johnson said the move was unforgivable.

Travis Hunter’s viral video from Alamo Bowl sparks outrage as he ignores a young fan while holding hands with fiancée Leanna Lenee,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/travis-hunters-viral-video-from-alamo-bowl-sparks-outrage-as-he-ignores-a-young-fan-while-holding-hands-with-fiance-leanna-lenee/articleshow/116830956.cms,"Image via Travis Hunter/Instagram

Travis Hunter Walks Hand In Hand With Leanna Lenee As He Ignores A Young Kid



Travis Hunter And His Fiancee Leanna Lenee Have Been Trolled Continuously In The Last Few Weeks



Travis Hunter Deactivates His Instagram Because of This...

Travis Hunter , the college football star and the recent recipient of the Heisman Trophy , suffered a devastating loss against the BYU Cougars at the 2024 Alamo Bowl. While this might be the end of Travis’ college football career, a video has gone viral which shows Travis was in no mood to interact with his fans after he lost to the BYU Cougars. In this video, he is seen walking out of the match venue hand in hand with his fiancee Leanna Lenee and ignoring anyone who comes his way.But what has irked fans is the way he ignored a kid who came his way. While Travis, his fiancee Leanna and his younger brother Trayvis, were getting on the escalator, a young kid ran up his way in order to probably get an autograph from Travis and get a chance to speak to him. But much to the disappointment of the kid and his fans, Travis ignored the young kid completely and did not even look his way. Fans were not happy with this reaction of his. A fan wrote, “I can’t believe he ignored the child 😢”, another fan wrote, “He can’t say hello to a kid? That’s bogus.”It might be possible that this reaction of Travis has stemmed from the fact that people trolled him and his would-be wife Leanna, mercilessly in the last few weeks. So much so that Travis had to temporarily delete his Instagram account while Leanna had to make her social media accounts private.Many people have now again blamed Leanna for the way Travis behaved with his fans after he lost to the BYU Cougars at the 2024 Alamo Bowl. A fan wrote, “His chick got him ignoring kids now a real simp”, another fan wrote, “She's locked in. 😂 Holding hands and everything.”Fans are also worried about his selection in the NFL. Even though he is a top college football athlete, the controversy around his relationship does not make a good impression on him. A fan wrote regarding this problem, “I guarantee NFL teams will view their relationship as a liability and distraction in NFL locker rooms. She really altered the entire focus of that Colorado team and Travis still acting like it’s okay.”Neither Travis nor Leanna has made any statements in public about this incident. A few days ago Travis had opened up in a podcast that the continuous hate and trolling have been “draining” him but he continued to defend his fiancee.However, recently, a video of Leanna had gone viral which was shot three years ago and showed her dancing with an unknown man “inappropriately.” This prompted Travis to completely go off his social media.The couple started dating in 2022 and are slated to get married in May 2025. However, there is still some doubts over when they began dating since Travis had mentioned jokingly that they have been dating since 2019. Both of them have not issued a statement about this.Travis and his fiancee also have a YouTube channel where they used to share glimpses of their wedding planning but they have not posted anything in the last few months.Also Read: Travis Hunter’s fiancée Leanna Lenee continues to face heavy criticism from fans after another controversial video of the couple’s tense moment goes viral","Travis Hunter lost to the BYU Cougars at the 2024 Alamo Bowl.

Fans Hopeful About Alex Anzalone’s Return As Head Coach Dan Campbell Shares A Light-Hearted Joke

Detroit Lions linebacker Alex Anzalone is getting set to return to the field as his broken arm seems to have recovered. On Sunday, Detroit will host Minnesota for the NFC North title and the No. 1 seed in the playoffs. The Lions team captain was listed as a participant in practice for the first time since fracturing his forearm during the Detroit vs Jaguars game. Head coach Dan Campbell looked pretty hopeful and even made a joke about Anzalone’s return, where he cheekily shared the test Anzalone would need to pass before returning.The Lions posted an estimated practice report, where Anzalone was listed as limited. Anzalone broke his forearm in November and was initially given a six- to eight-week timetable for recovery. Campbell said on Thursday that he's ""hopeful"" Anzalone will play this week. ""I hope so,"" he said. ""I hope so. He was at walk-through yesterday, he's going to practice today.""On Wednesday, the Lions held a non-contact walkthrough, the first session of the Week 18 game prep. Head coach Dan Campbell talked about Anzalone’s return right before the walkthrough. “He’ll be out there running around today, so we’ll see how he does,” Campbell shared. “It’s really going to be how he – tomorrow’s going to be, I think, a really big day for us to see where he’s at.”""Tomorrow's (Thursday) gonna be a really big day for us to see where he's at,"" Campbell said about the linebacker. According to ESPN's Adam Schefter, Anzalone has a ""realistic chance"" to play against the Vikings on Sunday.When asked about what Anzalone needs to do to be cleared, Campbell joked, ""He's got to be able to do a handstand.” He further added, ""He's got to be able to do a handstand press-up. And then really a version of a jumping jack on his hands.""Getting Anzalone back can be a major boost for the Lions’ struggling defense since he has been an asset for Aaron Glenn’s defense. The team has tried several replacements, including Ben Niemann, Kwon Alexander, Ezekiel Turner and Jamal Adams. In Anzalone's absence, Jack Campbell was one of many players who took up extra duties due to the many injuries within the team.Also Read: Lions fans showed their appreciation for Jared Goff with his name’s chants after win vs against the 49ers Campbell attempted to lead the defense. The first-round pick was assigned to relay Lions defensive coordinator Aaron Glenn's calls on the field.""I mean the last time I checked, it is the NFL and the most important thing is winning. You guys (reporters) will nitpick, that is your job, which I respect,"" Campbell said. ""But when you get out of there with a win and you're sitting here 14-2, you feel very fortunate. Not a lot of teams can say they've done that.”""Now, to have the opportunity to go against another 14-2 team is just amazing, so it's gonna be fun. It's just, I feel like, a testament to the organization in bringing the right guys. Guys that want to come in and be football players,” he added.","Detroit Lions linebacker Alex Anzalone is getting set to return to the field as his broken arm seems to have recovered.

CAVALIERS at LAKERS | FULL GAME HIGHLIGHTS | December 31, 2024

When and where to watch the Los Angeles Lakers vs Portland Trail Blazers game tonight (January 2, 2025)?

Los Angeles Lakers star Anthony Davis is listed as “questionable” for LA’s upcoming game against the Portland Trail Blazers. The 31-year-old is currently dealing with a left ankle sprain and there’s still no indication that he will suit up against the Trail Blazers. Davis was a part of the proceedings during the Lakers’ recent 122-110 loss against the Cavaliers.He played 37 minutes that night recording 28 points, 13 rebounds, and 4 assists. Austin Reaves also chipped in with 35 points, 10 assists, and 9 rebounds but it wasn’t enough to overcome the Cavs. However, Davis has been historically good against the Portland Trail Blazers and averages 23.5 points, 10.1 rebounds, and 2.9 assists in 36 games.These are numbers that will greatly help LA if Davis takes the floor tonight. The Lakers have recently added Dorian Finney-Smith to their lineup. While this is a solid pickup for them, it won’t translate to more wins until both LeBron James and Anthony Davis are on the floor. However, if Davis doesn’t play against the Blazers, we can expect Finney-Smith to step up in his place.The former Nets forward is averaging 10 points, 4.4 rebounds, and 1.6 assists per game, at the time of writing. He also shoots a respectable 45.4% from the field. While these numbers won’t blow anyone away, it is important to note that Finney-Smith often comes off the bench. Furthermore, having him on the floor will provide the Lakers with some much-needed range along with some energy on defense. However, they wouldn't need any of that energy if Anthony Davis was available for tonight's game. AD's size and presence in the paint would've done wonders for the Lakers against the Trail Blazers.It is also worth noting that the Trail Blazers aren’t in the best of forms at the moment and currently hold the 13th seed in the Western Conference. So even an ill-equipped Lakers team should be able to topple them. The Trail Blazers are averaging 16.5 turnovers per game and this will cost them dearly against the Lakers who are extremely quick in transition.ALSO READ: Portland Trail Blazers vs LA Lakers (01/02): Starting five, injury report, start time, game prediction, betting tips, how to watch, and more The Portland Trail Blazers will be taking a trip to Los Angeles as they prepare to play the Lakers at the Crypto.com Arena.

ESPN's Bill Barnwell has announced his NFL All-Pros picks, with quarterback Josh Allen as the final choice

Josh Allen 41 TDs 2024 Season

All-Pro is an award bestowed on the best player at each position in professional American football during a season. It is chosen by press organizations who compile an ""All-Pro team"" consisting of at least 22 players for each offensive and defensive position. These lists are limited to major leagues, usually the National Football League, but have included other major leagues in the past, such as the American Football League of the 1960s or the All-America Football Conference of the 1940s. Recently, ESPN released its All-Pro picks with only quarterback Josh Allen making the cut.The NFL regular season is almost over, and the Buffalo Bills have a big player on all-league lists. ESPN's Bill Barnwell has released his NFL All-Pros picks, and quarterback Josh Allen is the final choice. No other Buffalo Bills players were named to the first or second team.Allen, a second-team quarterback, won over Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson, according to Barnwell, who said the race was close. The All-Pro designation, though not officially sanctioned by the NFL, is considered a more prestigious honor than selections to the Pro Bowl, the NFL's annual all-star game. At least twice as many Pro Bowlers are selected as first and second team All-Pro slots combined.""Lamar Jackson has been absolutely spectacular, and Allen has been more consistent (while still, of course, occasionally looking like he's a space alien). They're both incredible. I very narrowly lean toward Allen, but I'm not ruling out changing my mind between now and next week. It's also worth noting that Allen isn't expected to play much Sunday against the Patriots -- Buffalo is locked into the 2-seed in the AFC -- while Jackson and the Ravens need to beat the Browns on Saturday to win the AFC North and clinch the 3-seed.”Debated over the best MVP between the two for this past month; experts split vote between them - Philadelphia Eagles' running back, Saquon Barkley - Cincinnati Bengals QB Joe Burrow. Experts propose that Jackson also has a stronger statistical advantage except for the teams for each having a good record overall plus Allen having scored 12 touchdown runs as apposed to three for Jackson, who has so far only netted four.Also Read: Heisman Trophy runner-up Ashton Jeanty falls short of Barry Sanders' single-season NCAA rushing record Allen's MVP case lacks Jackson's depth with Derrick Henry and Zay Flowers, while the Bills have used Allen's ""everyone eats"" attitude more often in their use of receivers and a running game that relies heavily on him and James Cook. Allen has been a vital piece for the Bills this season and should not make the All-Pro list, but no one is certain if the other players in the league feel Allen deserves the recognition.","ESPN's Bill Barnwell has announced his NFL All-Pros picks, with quarterback Josh Allen as the final choice.

The first Test between Zimbabwe and Afghanistan in Bulawayo ended in a thrilling draw on Monday, with both teams achieving record-breaking feats.Zimbabwe's first innings saw them amass a colossal 586 runs, surpassing their previous highest Test score of 563/9 against the West Indies in 2001. Afghanistan responded with an even more remarkable 699 all out, establishing their own record for the highest innings total, beating their previous best of 545/4, also achieved against Zimbabwe in 2021.The Afghan innings was highlighted by captain Hashmatullah Shahidi 's historic 246, a national record, and Rahmat Shah's 234. Together, they forged a massive 364-run third-wicket partnership, the highest in Afghanistan's Test history for any wicket. Shahidi’s 246 eclipsed his previous best of 200 against Zimbabwe in Abu Dhabi. Wicketkeeper Afsar Zazai also contributed a maiden Test century with 113 runs, further solidifying Afghanistan's dominance in their first innings.Zimbabwe's Brian Bennett, a 21-year-old spinner in only his second Test, showcased his all-around brilliance. Bennett took a career-best 5/95 in Afghanistan's innings and earlier contributed an unbeaten 110 with the bat in Zimbabwe's first innings.Afghanistan’s innings ended in a collapse, with the last six wickets falling for just 20 runs in four overs, largely due to Bennett's spin.

Zimbabwe showed resilience, with debutant Ben Curran impressing with 41 runs before a run-out, and opener Joylord Gumbie contributing 24.The second and final Test of the series begins Thursday, also in Bulawayo, with both teams eager to build on the momentum from this high-scoring encounter.For context, Sri Lanka still hold the record for the highest-ever Test innings score with 952/6 declared against India in Colombo in 1997.","The first Test between Zimbabwe and Afghanistan in Bulawayo ended in a thrilling draw on Monday.

is listed as “questionable” on the team’s injury report. So, we might not get to see him play in the starting five against the Boston Celtics. Though it is not certain if Porzingis will play, Celtics’ star player Jayson Tatum is playing as the team enters its upcoming game against the Timberwolves with significant injury concerns.Besides Kristaps Porzingis, Jaylen Brown faces a potential absence from tonight’s game between the Celtics and Timberwolves. The timing of these injuries is concerning given Brown’s possible absence tonight due to his sustained right shoulder injury.As just mentioned above, Kristaps Porzingis is currently listed as questionable with an ankle injury sustained during the 76ers game. Before exiting that matchup, Porzingis contributed 9 points, 2 rebounds, and 3 assists in 13 minutes of play.The Celtics' center court takes another hit with Jaylen Brown being ruled out due to a right shoulder injury from the game against the Toronto Raptors. While Brown has not missed a lot of games, this is an important game for the Celtics and the fans would want to see him in the starting five.The Minnesota Timberwolves also face their own injury challenges, though less impactful to their rotation. Rob Dillingham will miss his fifth straight game with a right ankle sprain, while Luka Garza remains sidelined for a seventh consecutive game due to a left ankle sprain.The Boston Celtics will probably give veteran Al Horford more playing time in order to make up for these absences, but they will also mostly rely on its key players, Jayson Tatum, Derrick White, and Jrue Holiday. Jordan Walsh and Payton Pritchard, two bench players, might be given more duties.The Celtics' anticipated starting lineup includes Derrick White at shooting guard, Jrue Holiday at point guard, Jayson Tatum at power forward, Jaylen Brown at small forward if cleared to play, and a centre replacement for the injured Porzingis.Mike Conley, Anthony Edwards, Jaden McDaniels, Julius Randle, and Rudy Gobert make up the Timberwolves' solid starting five, which is mainly untouched by their present injuries.Also read: Will Jaylen Brown play against the Minnesota Timberwolves tonight?

Taylor Swift’s Photos Have Confused Fans



Taylor Swift Is On A Break In New York City



The NFL star and the tight end of the Kansas City Chiefs , Travis Kelce ’s girlfriend, the global pop star, Taylor Swift is used to being in the headlines every day. But these recent photos of hers have sent her fans into a frenzy. Yesterday, a close friend of Taylor’s, Sonique, who is a professional designer, shared some pictures of her posing with Taylor. These pictures seemed to be from a party that the two attended.Sonique’s caption on the photos read as, “Happy New Year Twins.” Both women look stunning in the pictures; Taylor is dressed in a shimmery silver dress with stilettos. Taylor opted for a bun with fringes and completed the look with a red lip, nude makeup and red nails. Taylor’s friend, Sonique stunned in an outfit similar to Taylor’s but seemed to have skipped the red lip like Taylor.Taylor is seen also holding a red drink in her hand as she keeps posing with her friend. But what has confused fans is that many think these pictures are from the New Year’s Eve party of 2024 rather than 2023. A fan wrote, “It was last years photo not this years!”, another fan wrote, “Wait so was this last night or Dec. 31st, 2023?”However, neither Taylor nor her friend Sonique has cleared the doubts. Many fans also spoke about the drink that Taylor held in her hand and wrote, “Taylor’s loyalty to a vodka cran is unmatched, and honestly, we should all aspire to be that consistent.”While it is still unknown if these photos are from 2023 or 2024, fans seem to be very confused and are in a complete frenzy. Even many accounts of Taylor’s fandom have posted these pictures claiming it to be a picture fromNew Year’s Eve 2024 and fans dont know what to believe.The last time the global pop star was spotted was when she walked the streets of New York City, hand in hand with her boyfriend, the NFL star, Travis Kelce. She looked stunning and got everyone talking about how beautiful she looked with the expensive accessories she used to dress up.Taylor wrapped up her Eras Tour in the first week of December and has not announced any new project yet. As per reports, she is tired from being on for around a year and a half and just wants to spend time with her boyfriend and close friends. She is also planning to move in with her boyfriend in Kansas City so that she can be with him as he gears up for the Super Bowl Championship.Travis Kelce might be skipping the match against the Denver Broncos on 5th January and will be seen at the playoffs.Also Read: ""H*es make the best housewives"": Famous actor tells Travis Hunter to marry Leanna Lenee without prenup, sparking criticism","Taylor Swift's close friend, Sonique, shared some pictures of her posing with Taylor.

NEW DELHI: India lost openers KL Rahul and Yashasvi Jaiswal early after captain Jasprit Bumrah won the toss and opted to bat against Australia in overcast conditions and a grassy pitch at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Friday. Mitchell Starc dismissed KL Rahul and Yashasvi Jaiswal fell to Scott Boland. Virat Kohli arrived at the crease with India at 17/2 in 7.4 overs with the Aussies charged up.With Kohli getting dismissed caught behind the stumps throughout the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy , the Aussies had set the trap with a full slip cordon in place.Boland bowled back of a length delivery that nipped away, took the edge as Kohli pushed at it.The ball went down and Steve Smith at second slip thought he scooped it up but the ball had just grazed the turf before being taken by Marnus Labuschagne at gully.Aussies were delirious when they claimed it. But the third umpire took his time and signalled it not out and Kohli survived falling for a first ball duck.But former Australian opener and coach Justin Langer maintained that Kohli was out.7Cricket shared a post on X with Langer saying, ""From what I have seen there, that makes it more obvious to me that should have been out. Steve Smith had his fingers (underneath the ball), and you could see he was flicking the ball up, it was brilliant what he did. He had his fingers under the ball, he flicked it up deliberately and in my opinion that's out.""Former Australia captain Ricky Ponting also shared his views on the decision, ""As far as I was concerned, if (the ball) had've come out of (Smith's) hand, he wouldn't have been able to scoop it up. That's what I'm saying, I think his fingers are clearly underneath the ball ... look where his pointer figure is there, it's still underneath the ball.""Kohli, from 10 Tests and 19 innings in 2024, scored 417 runs at an average of 24.52 with one hundred and one fifty.That century by Virat was the unbeaten 100 he scored in the first Test in Perth - the match that India won by 295 runs.",India lost openers KL Rahul and Yashasvi Jaiswal early after captain Jasprit Bumrah won the toss and opted to bat against Australia.

Sydney: ""We're going to have a look at the wicket and finalise it tomorrow."" ""As I just said, we're going to have a look at the wicket and announce playing 11 tomorrow.""India head coach Gautam Gambhir responded when he was quizzed about the playing XI on eve of the fifth and final Test in Sydney.It was a typical response but what spiced up proceedings was the fact that he was categorically asked about Rohit Sharma 's participation at Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG). Not once, but twice.The response remained the same, even the words to a degree, and certainly raised quite a few eyebrows in the media room. It was Gambhir's first interaction with the media in Australia as the coach mysteriously stayed away after the pre-departure address back in November.He was back in the hot seat at a time when a lot of questions were being raised about the environment in the dressing room, knee-jerk reactions while selecting the XI and the defeat in Melbourne which came after a debatable call to benchThe No. 3 was benched to accommodate Rohit back at top of the order but it didn't work out as the Indian captain's lean patch continued and India were outplayed in the Boxing Day Test.Gambhir was constantly asked about the transition, discussions with senior players and he maintained that ""Indian cricket is in safe hands"" while emphasising the importance of ""honesty"".There was a lot of straight talk during the interaction which lasted a little over ten minutes but it was the sequence of events which followed that added to intrigue of India's last practice session of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy .Moments after finishing the presser, Gambhir engaged in a long conversation with Jasprit Bumrah near the change room as the rest of the lot played foot-volley. Once the warm-up was complete, the head coach made his way to the ground and had a chat with Shubman Gill, who was doing fielding drills at that time with coach T Dilip and Washington Sundar. A short chat was followed by a fist pump, pat on the back and soon Bumrah joined and gave Gill a handshake.The youngster, who was dropped for the Boxing Day Test, continued with more close-in catching drills as the likes of Virat Kohli, Rishabh Pant, KL Rahul, Nitish K Reddy and Yashasvi Jaiswal did some slip-catching. All this while Rohit stood away from the group and didn't participate in the catching drills, which he was very active in before the Melbourne fixture, and was one of the last players to leave the ground as rest of the batters made their way to the nets.Kohli, KL Rahul, Yashasvi Jaiswal and Ravindra Jadeja got the session underway and Rohit, still in his training shorts and sweatshirt, had a long chat with Washington Sundar outside the dressing room.Sundar left and then it was Gill's turn to speak to the skipper and this time they had Bumrah for company too. When the mini-conference was over, all players were sweating it out but Rohit was nowhere to be seen.Kohli, Jaiswal, KL, Jadeja and now Gill too were swapping nets as they continued to face the likes of Sundar, Reddy, Prasidh Krishna, Harshit Rana and a lot of side-arm.The action continued before Rohit finally made an appearance and stood in a corner chatting with video analyst Hari before starting a long, light-hearted chat with Bumrah. The seamer had a ball in his hand and the two cracked plenty of jokes but Rohit didn't look in the mood to have a hit.Players started to leave the area and Rohit exited too, adding to the curiosity of the travelling media contingent. He, however, returned in a few minutes with the batting gear on and had a small hit before India wrapped up their final session of the tour.It wasn't a usual net session as Rohit remains very chatty in the middle and has never stood in a corner, away from all the action. Thursday, however, was different and felt different. Even as the public announcer practiced the names of skippers of the two teams in the main ground, Rohit gave enough hints that he wasn't going to be one for the New Year Test. He has been for quite some time now and it wasn't a surprise that he has been dropped for the final game of the series.All signs in the nets pointed in only one direction and that was Rohit making way for Gill. The coach maintained that the call will be taken on the morning of the match but Rohit's last Test in whites has certainly happened at the Melbourne Cricket Ground and like most stalwarts, he signed off without a farewell match.","India head coach Gautam Gambhir was quizzed about the playing XI on eve of the fifth and final Test in Sydney.

Dallas Mavericks

P.J. Washington's injury leaves a big hole in Mavericks' lineup



Thefaced another tough injury setback during Wednesday's game against the Houston Rockets . Forward P.J. Washington hurt his right knee and was ruled out for the second half. It's not clear when Washington's knee injury happened. However, forward Maxi Kleber replaced him in Dallas' starting lineup after halftime. The Mavericks' PR team also announced on X that Washington would ""not return.""P.J. Washington finished with six points, three rebounds, one assist, and one block on 3-for-8 shooting (37.5%) in 16 minutes. Making $15.5 million this season, the sixth-year forward has been one of Dallas' best two-way players, often taking on tough defensive tasks. In his first 26 games, he averaged 12.8 points, 7.5 rebounds, 2.2 assists, 1.2 steals, 1.1 blocks, and 1.7 three-pointers per game, shooting 44.6% overall and 39.8% from three.In addition to Washington's absence, the Mavericks are also missing their top player, superstar guard Luka Doncic . The five-time All-Star hurt his left calf during the team’s 105-99 home loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves on Christmas Day. After the injury, Doncic was given a one-month timeline before his first re-evaluation. So, with Washington now injured, Dallas could be without two starters for the foreseeable future.Dallas entered Wednesday's game in fourth place (20-13) in the crowded Western Conference. However, they have struggled without P.J. Washington. The Mavericks have gone just 1-6 through seven games with Washington sidelined and 19-7 with him available. The team has been rumored to be looking to trade its 2025 first-round draft pick for roster help and has been linked to several top wings. So, with both Washington and Doncic injured, these setbacks might speed up that process.Dallas will next host the league-leading Cleveland Cavaliers (29-4) on Friday. The team should have an update on Washington’s return timeline by then.Also read: Mavericks’ P.J.

India XI:

NEW DELHI: In keeping with what TimesofIndia.com had reported a day prior, instead of Rohit Sharma it was Jasprit Bumrah who came for the toss against Australia for the fifth Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Friday.Bumrah won the toss in overcast conditions and a grassy pitch and opted to bat first.India made two changes in their playing XI from the last Test with Shubman Gill replacing Rohit Sharma and Prasidh Krishna coming in for Akash Deep.After winning the toss, Bumrah said, ""We are looking to bat first. We have played some good cricket. The last match was exciting. The grass doesn't look spicy. We always have learnt to digest defeats. We will look forward to this.""On being asked by Ravi Shastri about Rohit Sharma, Bumrah said, ""Our captain has shown leadership, he has opted to rest. It shows the unity we have. We have two changes. Rohit has opted out and Prasidh comes in for the injured Akash Deep.""Rohit made the call after scoring 31 runs in five innings across three Tests and looked like a pale shadow of himself in those innings, struggling to execute even his bread and butter shots including the trademark front pull.Rohit had a dreadful 2024 in Test cricket. In 14 Tests and 26 innings, Rohit scored 619 runs at an average of 24.76, hitting two centuries and a half-century.Both of these hundreds - a 131 in Rajkot and a 103 in Dharamsala - came against England.Rohit's last Test fifty came in the second innings of the first Test against New Zealand - a series that India lost 0-3, the first time that India lost three straight Tests at home.With scores of 3, 6, 10, 3 and 9 from five innings on this tour, Rohit has scored 31 runs at an average of 6.2 - the lowest batting average for a touring captain in a Test series in Australia (minimum five innings).Not just that, Rohit's average of 6.2 is the second lowest average for a top order (1-6) batter in a Test series in Australia (minimum 100 balls).Yashasvi Jaiswal, KL Rahul, Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli , Rishabh Pant(w), Ravindra Jadeja Nitish Kumar Reddy, Washington Sundar, Jasprit Bumrah(c), Prasidh Krishna, Mohammed Siraj","Jasprit Bumrah wins toss and opts to bat first against Australia.

Cowboys' Mike McCarthy Shares Honest Perspective on Future Amid Week 18 Matchup



It's been a tough year, yet again for Jerry Jones' Dallas Cowboys . And finally Cowboys ' 2024 season comes to an end on Sunday, Week 18, against the Washington Commanders. Also, this game could also mark the end of head coach Mike McCarthy 's tenure with the team. And he is aware of this situation.The Cowboys kicked off the 2024 season without an extension for McCarthy, indicating that he was coaching for his future. There were injuries that had the team struggling, yet the failure to meet expectations and secure a playoff spot adds more pressure on McCarthy. Still, he kept a motivated and competitive team until their postseason hopes started fading.Addressing reporters on Thursday, McCarthy openly acknowledged the reality of his situation, stating, “I won a Super Bowl in that home locker room at AT&T Stadium. So, I have a very strong emotional attachment that it hits me every time I walk in there and every time I walk out. So, yeah, I’m definitely aware of it.”A record of 49-34 in five seasons, including 1-3 in the playoffs, illustrates the mixed bag that has characterized McCarthy's tenures. And yet, the prospect of another division title- or another postseason failure-looms large over the entire Cowboys coaching staff, including McCarthy, as their contracts are all about to run out, leaving the future of the franchise uncertain.Cowboys owner Jerry Jones has not publicly committed to McCarthy’s return, but his recent comments suggest a degree of satisfaction with the head coach. During a radio appearance on 105.3 The Fan, Jones remarked, “Well, I feel good about Mike McCarthy, and the main thing is that I like that job that he's done. It's unfortunate we're having the year we had, but I feel good about Mike.” While Jones’ words are far from a vote of confidence, they leave the door open for McCarthy’s potential return.Also Read: ""It means a lot to me"": Playoff-ready Bills to bench most starters, but Josh Allen insists showing up still matters It could be possible that the last game in week 18 may not carve an imprint on McCarthy's legacy in Dallas, but it is certainly a major juncture. Whether he stays or transfers, McCarthy's emotional tie to the team and his ability to navigate a difficult year with demeanor will certainly not escape attention. For the Cowboys, they are headed to the Commanders, and McCarthy is still with the mindset of finishing well that this year may, in fact, be the end of the arc.","Dallas Cowboys' 2024 season comes to an end on Sunday, Week 18, against the Washington Commanders.

Gautam Gambhir on India XI for SCG Test, dressing room unity and more

As reported by Timesofindia.com on the eve of the Sydney Test , India captain Rohit Sharma was dropped from the playing eleven for the series-decider against Australia, which began on Friday.Rohit, who had scored just 31 runs in five innings of this Border Gavaskar Trophy (BGT) was replaced by Shubman Gill, while KL Rahul returned to the opening slot alongside Yashasvi Jaiswal. But what surprised former India batter turned commentator Sanjay Manjrekar was the fact that the official reason for Rohit's exclusion was not discussed during the chat with India's stand-in captain, Jasprit Bumrah, at the toss.But contrary to Manjrekar's view, stand-in skipper Jasprit Bumrah did speak about it at the toss. ""Our skipper has opted to rest. It shows the unity we have,"" the fast bowler said.However, Manjrekar said it was ""mysterious"" of former India coach Ravi Shastri, who conducted the toss, to not ask about the situation around Rohit.""Very mysterious from Ravi,"" Manjrekar said on Star Sports. ""I was amazed. I don't understand this cloak and dagger thing in Indian cricket. This is the issue with Indian cricket culture. We are just secretive in our operation. Rohit Sharma is someone who has played 62 Test matches.""We have to share with the fans who have made cricket the great game that it is in India. When they see Bumrah walking out (for the toss), the first thought in their minds is what happened to Rohit Sharma? Has he opted out? Has he been dropped? I was amazed that at the toss he (Bumrah) wasn't asked. I have done the toss a few times. That would have been the first question after asking him what are you doing (decision to bat or bowl).""Manjrekar said it's difficult to believe Rohit being 'rested' for a match that will decide if India retain the Border Gavaskar Trophy (BGT) and is also crucial to the team's thin chances of qualifying for the World Test Championship final.Australia, who lead the five-Test series 2-1, need a win or a draw to reclaim the BGT for the first time since 2014.""I believe the official word is that he has opted to rest. Will fans accept that? This is the guy who didn't play in the first Test, didn't play domestic cricket before the New Zealand series. If anyone needs rest, it is the (stand-in) captain (Bumrah) who is playing this Test,"" Manjrekar added.""That is the issue that I have with Indian cricket culture. We have some brilliant cricketers and the fans follow them passionately. We just don't give them facts as much as they deserve by this very mysterious and secretive operation around some important matters.""","India captain Rohit Sharma was dropped from the playing eleven for the series- decider against Australia.

As the match ended, cricket memes went viral on social media platforms. Here are some of the viral memes that just capture the emotion/sadness of Indian Cricket fans.

Record number of spectators

Australia clinched a thrilling 184-run victory over India in a dramatic final session of the fourth Test in Melbourne, taking a 2-1 lead in the five-match series. India, needing 340 to win, collapsed to 155 all out, losing their last seven wickets for just 34 runs in 20.3 overs. India appeared to be heading for a draw after Yashasvi Jaiswal (84) and Rishabh Pant (30) steered them to 112-3 at tea.However, Pant's dismissal, attempting a six off Travis Head, triggered a batting collapse.Controversy arose with Jaiswal's dismissal. Initially given not out to a caught-behind appeal, the TV umpire overturned the decision based on visual evidence of the ball changing direction, despite the absence of audible noise. Jasprit Bumrah was exceptional for India, taking 5-57 in the second innings and nine wickets in the match. He had reduced Australia to 91-6 at one stage, a lead of less than 200.The match set a record attendance for cricket in Australia, with 373,591 spectators. Head described the atmosphere as inspiring and hailed the match as one of the best he has been involved in. India now needs to win the final Test in Sydney to level the series and retain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy .","Australia beat India by 184 runs in the fourth Test in Melbourne.

NEW DELHI: Just as the MCG Test had its share of drama, the SCG Test delivered a moment of high tension when a contentious umpiring decision went in favour of India’s star batter Virat Kohli . The drama unfolded in the 8th over when Kohli survived a golden duck on his very first delivery.After dismissing Yashasvi Jaiswal earlier in the over, Scott Boland nearly claimed his second wicket with a well-directed delivery that found Kohli’s outside edge. The ball flew toward second slip, where Steve Smith dived to his right, scooping it toward Marnus Labuschagne at gully.However, replays revealed the ball had brushed the ground after rolling off Smith’s fingers—a detail spotted by TV umpire Joel Wilson , who ruled Kohli not out.The Indian dressing room watched the drama unfold on the big screen, with Rohit Sharma , who had been excluded from the playing XI, visibly tense.Once the decision came through in Kohli’s favour, Rohit finally sat back, appearing more at ease.Rohit scored 31 runs in five innings across three Tests.Last year Rohit guided India to a much-awaited T20 World Cup title.","Virat Kohli survives a golden duck on his very first delivery.

Another controversy erupted early on the first morning of the fifth Test between India and Australia in Sydney when a relay catch involving Steve Smith and Marnus Labuschagne off Virat Kohli 's bat was ruled by the third umpire as not legitimate.With Indian openers KL Rahul (4) and Yashasvi Jaiswal (10) dismissed early, India were 17 for 2 when Kohli came in to bat and edged the first ball he faced from Scott Boland to the slips, where the Aussie players claimed the relay catch between Smith and Labuschagne.Diving low to his right, Smith believed to have got his fingers underneath the ball before lobbing it in the air for Labuschagne to complete the catch. The decision was referred by the on-field umpires for review, and the third umpire ruled that the ball grazed the ground before Smith lobbed it back up.Talking to Fox Cricket at the lunch break, Smith said he has no doubt that it was a clean catch, but they have to accept the decision taken by the match officials.""Did you get your hand underneath that ball?"" former England player turned commentator Isa Guha asked Smith?""100%, no denying it whatsoever. But the umpires made the decision, and we move on,"" replied Smith.After replays were shown on the giant screen and the third umpire announced his view, Kohli was seen shaking his head with a wry smile on his face.India went to lunch at a shaky 57 for 3, losing Shubman Gill (20) off the last ball delivered by off-spinner Nathan Lyon before the break, leaving Kohli on the crease at 20 not out. He was joined by Rishabh Pant post lunch.Earlier, India left captain Rohit Sharma out of the eleven, with Jasprit Bumrah doing the leadership duty and chose to bat first after winning the toss.India made two changes to their team.

KOHLI IN ONGOING BGT:

NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli ’s struggles against deliveries outside the off-stump have become a glaring issue in the series, further denting the confidence of India’s star batter.During the SCG Test , Kohli’s lean patch with the bat continued as he fell to another outside-off delivery, this time from Scott Boland.Kohli managed 17 runs off 69 balls, marking the longest innings of his Test career without hitting a boundary. Boland bowled with precision, consistently targeting the corridor outside off and eventually induced an edge from Kohli.The catch was a stunner, as Beau Webster dived to his left to complete a brilliant grab, sending Kohli back to the pavilion.This marked the fourth time Boland has dismissed Kohli in Test cricket, with all four dismissals involving catches by the wicketkeeper or in the slip cordon.Kohli’s performance in the series has been below par, accumulating just 184 runs in 8 innings at an average of 26.29.Perth Test: 5 and 100*Adelaide Test: 7 and 11Brisbane Test: 3Melbourne Test: 36 and 5Sydney Test: 17 and Yet to bat",Virat Kohli dismissed by Scott Boland for 17 runs in SCG Test.

IND vs AUS: Rohit Sharma dropped! Exclusive visuals of his last session with India Test team

The Australian cricket team erupted in joy after what seemed to be an astonishing team catch off Virat Kohli ’s first ball on the opening day of the fifth Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground.However, third umpire Joel Wilson ruled it not out.Kohli edged the ball to Steve Smith in the slips, who dived low to his right and managed to pop the ball up, allowing Marnus Labuschagne to take the catch.Despite this, the decision was overturned by Wilson, as it appeared that the ball had grazed the ground after Smith’s attempt.This ruling has sparked considerable debate among fans and experts alike.Former Australia opener and coach Justin Langer believes Kohli was out. “From what I have seen there, that makes it more obvious to me that should have been out. Steve Smith had his fingers (underneath the ball), and you could see he was flicking the ball up, it was brilliant what he did,” he said on 7 Cricket.“He had his fingers under the ball, he flicked it up deliberately and in my opinion that’s out.”Ricky Ponting agreed with Langer.“As far as I was concerned, if (the ball) had’ve come out of (Smith’s) hand, he wouldn’t have been able to scoop it up,” he said on 7 Cricket.“I think his fingers are clearly underneath the ball … look where his pointer figure is there, it’s still underneath the ball.”Former Test umpire Simon Taufel on Channel 7 explained why the Virat Kohli first-ball review was hard to judge.“I think you described it very well when you said that depending upon which side of the fence you sit on you could probably build a case for either decision to be given,” he said.“Listening to Joel Wilson’s language there, where he said the fingers were underneath the ball and then he’s seen it roll on to the ground, by his own language he is telling us that he believes he’s seeing that ball on the ground.“So, there are two things that the TV umpire here is looking for. One is fingers underneath the ball. He was satisfied there. But then he believes through those pictures that he’s clearly seen the ball on the ground.“And here’s the challenge, slowing it right down with slow-mo. Play it at real speed and it looks pretty good.“I can certainly understand what the third umpire’s done there. He believes he’s seen the ball on the ground and called it way he’s seen it. Normally the ICC protocol on fair catches is if you see the fingers underneath the ball, that’s good to maintain a fair catch.“But here’s the problem: the on-field umpire’s no longer have the soft signal and make the decision, it’s purely in the hands of the television umpire now.”Mark Waugh, in commentary for Fox, also felt it was out.“Virat Kohli will breath a huge sigh of relief, Australian fans will feel they’ve been robbed, Indian fans (it’s) desperate relief,” Isa Guha said on Fox Cricket.Mark Waugh believes the finger was underneath the ball when it touched the turf.“It would’ve been a great catch … I think it was … he’s not happy,” he said.“You see his right finger just underneath it … I think he’s got away with one there Kohli.”Former Australian greater Allan Border was unsure. “Those ones looks so close, it’s hard to tell,” he said.Ex-India allrounder Irfan Pathan said Kohli was rightly given not out.“Virat Kohli was not out which was rightly called NOT OUT. will explain during the break,” Pathan wrote on X.","Virat Kohli edged the ball to Steve Smith in the slips, who dived low to his right and managed to pop the ball up, allowing Marnus Labuschagne to take the catch.

Why R Ashwin retirement was a last minute surprise for Ravindra Jadeja

The Indian cricket team is currently navigating a period of transition in Test matches. This shift became apparent after the third Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy when R Ashwin unexpectedly announced his retirement from international cricket.Ashwin participated in the second Test but opted for immediate retirement, returning home the day after the third Test at the Gabba in Brisbane.This abrupt decision sparked discussions regarding the team management's approach to the esteemed spinner. Anil Kumble , another Indian cricket legend, expressed his annoyance with the way it was handled.In acolumn, Kumble shared his belief that Ashwin deserved a more fitting farewell. He felt a structured plan for Ashwin's exit should have been in place.""Players who have contributed for such a long period deserve a grand farewell. They need to be sat down and offered an appropriate plan on how you want them to leave the game. I was very disappointed with the way Ashwin left,"" wrote Ashwin in his column.""Many cricketers in the past missed out on a farewell, too. The kind of benchmarks he has set won’t be easy for anyone to live up to. He served Indian cricket with distinction.""Ashwin retired as India's second-highest wicket-taker in Test matches, trailing only Kumble himself. Kumble finished his career with 619 wickets, while Ashwin had 537.Kumble revealed he had encouraged Ashwin to aim for 600 wickets and subsequently 619. He believed Ashwin had the potential to achieve these milestones.""I remember telling Ashwin he should get to 600 when he crossed the 500 mark — and then 619. The way he was going, he had a very good chance. He didn’t have a great series against New Zealand, but that was one in 14 years.""Kumble was left equally ""perplexed"" by the team management's decision over the years to not use him in overseas conditions.""Unfortunately, the team management did not consistently select Ashwin to play in England, South Africa, and Australia, which has always perplexed me. With Ravindra Jadeja bowling in tandem, India could have had these two in every match. Ashwin has consistently picked wickets on every surface he has played on. So to typecast him as a spinner, mostly in subcontinent conditions, is not fair,"" wrote Kumble.Ashwin's performance against New Zealand was unusually lacklustre, managing only nine wickets in three Test matches. This series marked India's first-ever whitewash defeat in a three-Test home series.It was also India's first Test series loss at home since 2012. This series underscored the changing dynamics within the Indian Test cricket landscape.","R Ashwin unexpectedly announced his retirement from international cricket.

NEW DELHI: Zimbabwe's experienced campaigner Sikandar Raza and young talent Newman Nyamhuri on Thursday claimed three wickets apiece, restricting Afghanistan to 157 runs on Day 1 of the second Test in Bulawayo.Following a four-hour delay due to wet conditions at Queens Sports Club, Zimbabwe reached 6-0 at the close of play.Skipper Craig Ervine 's decision to field first after winning the toss proved advantageous, particularly after his bowlers struggled in the previous drawn Test, where they conceded 699 runs in the first innings.The strategy proved successful as Raza (3-30) and Nyamhuri (3-42) delivered impressive performances, each securing crucial Afghan wickets.""Given the conditions, I was convinced bowling first was the way to go.

Rashid Khan 's quick 25 suggested a potential recovery before he was caught by Brian Bennett at deep point following a poor shot selection.With Afghanistan struggling at 125-8, a final wicket partnership of 27 runs between Zia-ur-Rehman (8 not out) and Fareed Ahmad (17) helped improve their total.",Sikandar Raza and Newman Nyamhuri take three wickets each on Day 1 of second Test.

NEW DELHI: India skipper Rohit Sharma has been dropped from the final Border-Gavaskar Trophy Test which starts from January 3 in Sydney.Amid a woeful run with the bat, the tough call on Rohit has been taken by the team management, as reported by TimesofIndia.com , and young Shubman Gill, in all likeliness, will replace the India captain in the playing XI for the Pink Test.With just 31 runs in five innings in the ongoing BGT, Rohit averaged a horrendous 6.20 and was really struggling with the bat.But Rohit's struggle has not only been limited to his outings Down Under.In the previous India vs New Zealand series at home, Rohit performed terribly as well, scoring a mere 91 runs in three Tests.Amid Rohit's run rut, the team too struggled as India suffered an unprecedented 0-3 whitewash against the BlackCaps. In the BGT as well, India currently trails 2-1.Throughout India's recent poor showings, Rohit maintained that India batters performed poorly. But recently Rohit has also taken personal responsibility, saying he has indeed under-performed with the bat.Here's a look at what Rohit has said recently in his pressers, starting with the New Zealand series:""I am hurting a little bit because I made that call (on wrongly accessing the pitch). We found ourselves in a situation where we got bowled out for 46 runs. As a captain, it definitely hurts to see that number.""Though in 365 days, you will make two or three bad calls. That is absolutely fine, I guess.""""The challenge that was thrown at us, we didn't respond well. Sometimes you make the right call, sometimes you don't. I was on the other side of it this time around,""""It was a bad day for us. But we have played many such matches before.""""I do not doubt anyone's ability. I won't do much postmortem of this, but batters must come with their plans and trust on the plans like New Zealand batters showed.""It's disappointing. It's not what we expected. We got to give credit to New Zealand as they played better than us. We failed to respond to those challenges.""I didn't think we batted well enough to get runs on the board. You've got to pick 20 wickets to win, yes, but batters have to put runs on the board.""Something like this will be a very low point of my career and I take full responsibility for it.""Yes absolutely (bitter pill to swallow). Losing a series, a Test match, is never easy... something that is not easily digestible. We didn't play our best cricket. New Zealand played better throughout the series. There were a lot of mistakes we did,"" Rohit said at the post-match presentation ceremony.""The first two Tests we did not put enough runs in the first innings. This game we got the 30 runs (28) lead and the target was chaseable.""We failed as a unit. When you are chasing a target like that, you want runs on the board. That was in my mind and it did not come of. When it does not come off it does not look great.""I go in with certain plans and those did not come off this series. We did not play our best cricket in these conditions and are facing the result of that.""""I was not at my best as captain in leading the team as well as with the bat also. Collectively as a unit we failed to perform,"" the India skipper said.""The way he (KL Rahul) has batted outside India, he deserves it. I will bat somewhere in the middle. It was a fairly simple decision. Personally, it wasn’t easy but for the team, it was an easy decision to make.""Maybe in the future, things will be different. I don't know. Based on what has happened and what KL Rahul has shown outside of India, he probably deserves that place at this point in time. It is something that has brought us success in the first Test.""You have that one big partnership with Jaiswal on the other side, and it probably won us the Test match. When you come here, in a place like Perth, and you get 500 runs or so, it’s such a massive tick in the box,"" he elaborated.""Disappointing week for us, we didn't play well enough to win the game and Australia played better than us.""We knew it was going to be challenging with the pink ball. Like I said, Australia was better than us.""We are quite looking forward to it (Gabba Test), there's not much time in between as well. We want to go out there and think about what we did right in Perth and what we did last time when we were.""I have not batted well. There's no harm in accepting that. But I know what's in my mind, how I'm preparing myself. All those boxes are very much ticked. It's just about spending as much time as possible, which I'm pretty sure I'm just there.""As long as my mind, my body, my feet are moving well, I'm pretty happy with how things are panning out for me. Sometimes those numbers can tell you that it's been a while since he's got big runs.""But for a person like me, it's all about how I feel in my mind, what kind of prep I'm having before each game, and how I'm feeling about myself. That's the most important thing. And I'm feeling good about myself, to be honest. Runs are obviously not showing that, but inside it's a different feeling,"" he said.""A lot of the things I am trying to do are not falling in the place that I would want to.""Mentally, look, it is disturbing without a doubt if you've come here and you want to try to do successfully what you are supposed to.""But as of now that is where it is and there are things that we as a team need to look at, and I personally need to look at as well.""We will see what happens. There is still a game to go.","India skipper Rohit Sharma has been dropped from the final Border-Gavaskar Trophy Test which starts from January 3 in Sydney.

NEW DELHI: The upcoming Sydney Test against Australia is a crucial match for Team India, as their chances of reaching the ICC World Test Championship (WTC) final hinge on the outcome.South Africa's narrow two-wicket win against Pakistan in Centurion confirmed their place as the first team to qualify for the WTC final, scheduled at Lord's next June.With only one spot remaining, India, Australia, and Sri Lanka are in contention, but the dynamics are stacked against India after recent setbacks.Australia’s emphatic 184-run win over India at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) was a significant blow to India’s aspirations. The defeat saw India drop to third place on the WTC standings , with their win percentage slipping to 52.78—well behind Australia and South Africa.This was India’s first defeat to significantly shift qualification out of their control in this WTC cycle. A victory at Sydney is non-negotiable for India to keep their hopes alive.Winning at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) would elevate India’s win percentage to 55.26, keeping them in the hunt for the final berth.However, India would also need favourable results from Australia’s two-Test series against Sri Lanka.Specifically, India would hope for Australia to fail to secure a win, as any Australian victory against Sri Lanka would end India’s hopes, regardless of India’s performance at the SCG.Australia, meanwhile, can secure their spot with a win at the SCG. This would raise their win percentage to an unassailable 57, locking them in for the WTC final regardless of Sri Lanka's performance.Even if the SCG Test results in a draw, Australia’s chances remain strong, requiring only a single drawn match in their series against Sri Lanka to edge out both India and Sri Lanka.For India, the stakes are monumental. Failure to win at Sydney would see them eliminated from contention, marking a disappointing end to their WTC campaign. Amid the high stakes and growing tensions, India have decided to drop Rohit Sharma for the fifth and final test of the series, as reported by TimesofIndia.com.With their destiny tethered to results beyond their control, the Sydney Test appears to be nothing short of make-or-break for India.","India's chances of reaching the ICC World Test Championship final hinge on the outcome of the Sydney Test against Australia.

Former Indian cricketer Madan Lal has shared his views on Rohit Sharma 's captaincy and the team's performance, highlighting the need for a collective effort against a strong opponent like Australia.""As a team, you have to perform. You're playing against Australia, not Sri Lanka. You have to seize the moment. And Jasprit Bumrah is the only bowler taking wickets. The rest of them, they're taking wickets too, but not breaking through at the right moments,"" he told IANS.""Like, if you see… Mohammed Siraj took wickets. But the thing is, when did he take those wickets? When 400 runs had already been scored, or 300 runs, or 250, or 400 runs,"" he added.Jasprit Bumrah's performance has been a highlight for India in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy . He currently leads the wicket-takers list with 30 wickets at an average of 12.83.Bumrah recently achieved the milestone of 200 Test wickets in Australia, becoming the fastest Indian pacer to do so. His 71 wickets in 2024 place him fifth on the list of most Test wickets by an Indian bowler in a calendar year.""When Bumrah is getting wickets, the bowler at the other end also needs to strike. Akash Deep took one or two wickets, but someone needs to bowl consistently. The only one consistently getting wickets is Jasprit. You need support from the other end too, and at the right time,"" he added.India faces a must-win situation in the Sydney Test to maintain their chances of reaching the World Test Championship Final . They also need Australia to lose at least one of their two Tests against Sri Lanka to secure their spot at Lord's in June.Madan Lal offered advice to the Indian team ahead of the crucial Sydney Test, emphasising the importance of staying calm and giving their best effort, despite the challenging conditions in Australia.""Don't panic. Believe in yourself. You have a good team with you, and you have a good bowling unit. You should come back strongly. It's a team game, not an individual game here. They are very, very experienced players, mature players, and they know their job.""He encouraged the team to avoid panic and believe in their abilities. He reminded them that they are a capable side with experienced players who understand their roles.""They need to do it with confidence. That's what I say. There is nothing to worry about. You are playing in Australia, at their home ground. You need to perform twice as well, because Australia is very strong at home, just like we are strong at our home.""Lal reiterated the importance of playing with confidence and recognising the strength of the Australian team at home. He compared it to India's dominance on home turf.""Whatever the team management decides, whatever the captain decides, you need to be in a good frame of mind when playing the Test match. Because being 2-1 down, if you win this Test match, you are worthy to square the series. That is very good, and I am sure they will do it.""",Former Indian cricketer Madan Lal has shared his views on Rohit Sharma's captaincy and the team's performance.

India's likely XI vs Australia for SCG Test

READ ALSO:

NEW DELHI: As reported by TimesofIndia.com, Team India are set to approach the final Test in Sydney without Rohit Sharma at the helm following a challenging run of form.His prolonged struggles with the bat, compounded by back-to-back defeats against New Zealand and Australia in the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy (BGT), appears to have led to this omission.Despite experimenting with various batting positions, Rohit has been unable to revive his faltering Test career. The numbers tell a sobering story. In 2024, his performance fell well short of the high standards he once set. Averaging only 24.76 across 26 innings, his contributions include just two centuries and two half-centuries.In India’s last five Test defeats, Rohit's performance has nosedived, with his average plummeting to a mere 11.20 across 10 innings.His recent outings hint at a troubling pattern of inconsistency, yielding scores of 2 and 52, 0 and 8, along with a series of single-digit dismissals during the ongoing Australian tour.With India set to take the field at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) on Friday without Rohit Sharma, here's a glimpse at how Team India could shape up against Australia:Rahul and Yashasvi Jaiswal have been the bright spots for India in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. While Jaiswal's consistency at the top has been crucial, Rahul had to adjust to the No. 3 spot after Rohit Sharma opted to open at MCG, a position where he struggled to make a significant impact.With Rohit’s omission for the SCG Test, Rahul is set to reclaim his preferred opening slot, offering him a fresh opportunity to make a stronger impression.After being dropped for the fourth Test, Shubman Gill will likely return to the playing XI following an intense training session on the eve of the SCG Test.Meanwhile, Virat Kohli, despite his underwhelming form as well, is expected to retain his spot in the lineup. The same holds true for Rishabh Pant, whose shot-selection during the series has drawn significant criticism but who continues to be backed for his match-winning potential.Team India are expected to stick with the trio of Nitish Reddy, Ravindra Jadeja, and Washington Sundar for the SCG Test. After R Ashwin's retirement, the spin-bowling all-rounder department has felt his absence, but Sundar's recent form has provided some relief.Alongside Sundar, Jadeja's consistent bowling performances have ensured his place in the XI, despite his struggles with the bat. Nitish Reddy also seems certain to feature again, rounding out India's balanced all-round combination.Jasprit Bumrah, in the absence of Rohit, will captain the team. It rekindles the memories of his remarkable captaincy in the Perth Test, where his leadership and fiery bowling secured India an early 1-0 lead in the series.Mohammed Siraj, having taken 16 wickets, is already third on the list of top wicket-takers in BGT. However, whether India choose to go with Harshit Rana or Prasidh Krishna in the Team India XI is anyone's guess.Yashasvi Jaiswal, KL Rahul, Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Rishabh Pant, Nitish Reddy, Ravindra Jadeja, Washington Sundar, Harshit Rana / Prasidh Krishna, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Siraj","Rohit Sharma dropped for final Test against Australia at Sydney Cricket Ground.

The timeless Liverpool and Manchester United rivalry now seems one-sided,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/epl/top-stories/the-timeless-liverpool-and-manchester-united-rivalry-now-seems-one-sided/articleshow/116888751.cms,"Manchester United's Bruno Fernandes (AP Photo)

Liverpool and Manchester United , once English football's fiercest rivals, face each other at Anfield on Sunday. The two teams are currently on very different trajectories.Liverpool is at the top of both the Premier League and the Champions League . They aim to match Manchester United's record of 20 Premier League titles, and potentially achieve even more. In the last seven years, Liverpool has only lost once to United in the Premier League. Their most recent encounter was a 3-0 victory for Liverpool at Old Trafford in September.Manchester United finds itself closer to the relegation zone than the top of the table. This season has been another difficult one, marked by the departure of a manager and sporting director, and the sidelining of a key player.The growing disparity between the two clubs is stark. Liverpool is vying for a quadruple of trophies, while Manchester United is battling to avoid relegation. This begs the question: how did two of England's most successful teams end up on such divergent paths?Manchester United's decline has been evident since their record 20th title win in 2013, Alex Ferguson's final season as manager. The club hasn't come close to winning the league since his retirement. Ruben Amorim is the sixth permanent manager appointed in the past eleven years.David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, Jose Mourinho, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, and Erik ten Hag have all been unable to achieve consistent success at United. The constant managerial changes have hindered the club's progress, leading to frequent shifts in direction.Amorim has quickly grasped the scale of the challenge, having overseen six defeats in his last eight games. He acknowledged the possibility of a relegation battle this week.“It is a possibility,” he said. “We have to be clear with our fans.”While Manchester United has struggled to replace a legendary manager, Liverpool's transition appears to have been seamless.Arne Slot took on the challenging task of succeeding Jürgen Klopp at the end of the last season. He has since propelled the team to new heights.Klopp achieved significant success at Anfield, winning a complete set of trophies. His only obstacle to further Premier League titles was Pep Guardiola's Manchester City.Under Slot, Liverpool currently leads the Premier League by six points with a game in hand. They also hold a three-point lead in the Champions League and have reached the semi-finals of the English League Cup.Slot may have benefited from Manchester City's decline this season. However, Liverpool's record of 14 wins from 18 league games is impressive in any season.Manchester United has spent billions on player transfers, yet costly mistakes have outnumbered successful acquisitions.High-profile signings like Angel di Maria, Alexis Sanchez, Paul Pogba, Casemiro, and Jadon Sancho have failed to meet expectations. Recent additions, including Joshua Zirkzee and Matthijs de Ligt, have also struggled.If Amorim wants to bring in new players in January, he might have to sell some existing ones. Marcus Rashford, recently dropped from the team, could be a valuable asset to generate funds.In contrast, Liverpool has been one of the most astute operators in the transfer market in recent years. Their significant expenditures have generally been wise, with players like Virgil van Dijk and Alisson becoming key figures in their trophy wins. Mohamed Salah and Andy Robertson were acquired for relatively modest fees.Under the ownership of Fenway Sports Group (FSG), the American conglomerate that also owns the Boston Red Sox, Liverpool has regained its prominence in English and European football, ending a 30-year wait for a Premier League title.Klopp's appointment was crucial to this success, but so was the contribution of sporting director Michael Edwards. Edwards played a key role in numerous successful transfers. He left in 2022 but has returned as FSG's chief executive of football and has helped to manage the transition to Slot.Manchester United's American owners, the Glazer family, have faced consistent fan protests since their leveraged buyout of the club in 2005.Last year, British billionaire Jim Ratcliffe made a minority investment in the club, which generated some optimism. He took charge of the club's football operations, but things haven't gone as planned.Erik ten Hag was dismissed just months after signing a contract extension, and sporting director Dan Ashworth left after less than six months. The signings made during Ratcliffe's first summer transfer window also appear questionable, with United currently 14th in the league, just seven points above the relegation zone.Liverpool is having an excellent season, but significant challenges remain.Mohamed Salah, Virgil van Dijk, and Trent Alexander-Arnold's contracts expire at the end of this season. Salah and Van Dijk are in their thirties, and there's disagreement over the length of the contracts Liverpool is willing to offer them. Alexander-Arnold has reportedly attracted interest from Real Madrid.Amorim's immediate priority is to improve Manchester United's performance. In the long term, his current squad seems ill-suited to his preferred playing style.","Liverpool and Manchester United are once English football's fiercest rivals. The two teams are currently on very different trajectories. Liverpool is vying for a quadruple of trophies, while Manchester United is battling to avoid relegation. This begs the question: how did two of England's most successful teams end up on such divergent paths?","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116888933,imgsize-37908,width-400,resizemode-4/116888933.jpg"
