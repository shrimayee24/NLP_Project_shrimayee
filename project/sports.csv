Why people kill their partners

The silent suffering of men

NEW DELHI: It begins as it always does. A random look over a room, that brief moment when eyes connect and all else disappears. Late-night texts, words with promises. The romantic whispers of ""forever"" in the night, visions of futures together, lives intertwined. But sometimes, forever isn’t enough. Sometimes, forever ends in a zipped-up body bag - some chopped, some torched, some frozen.Across India, 2025 has seen a gruesome string of murders where wives and their lovers are allegedly turning executioners, transforming homes into horror scenes.In Meerut, Saurabh Rajput was chopped, stuffed in a blue plastic drum, and buried in cement. His wife and her lover reportedly watched him die.In Bijnor, a man was strangled, his wife pinned him down, and her lover crushed his throat. Reason? He didn’t want to move.In Auraiya, two weeks into marriage, the husband was lured, ambushed, and dumped like trash.In Jaipur, a man was burned alive. Flesh melted, and smoke choked the room. His crime? Questioning infidelity.In Korba, a woman confessed to stabbing her husband multiple times.She claimed abuse, but the scene was soaked in rage—blood on walls, a body left in fury.These murders echo an earlier case in Delhi, where Shraddha Walkar’s dismembered remains were found stuffed in a fridge by her live-in partner. A similar horror played out months later in Munirka, where a woman’s body was chopped up and left to rot by her partner.There’s no one pattern, no clear trigger. But there’s always a simmer. A slow erosion. A point where love curdles into control, affection turns into obsession, and murder feels like the only exit.""People are not coming in time to seek advice and help. By the time they do, it's often too late,"" mental wellness experts said unequivocally.They have seen the breakdown happen up close - from honeymoon to homicide.“There is rising infidelity, emotional neglect, and extramarital affairs. By the time couples come for therapy, the relationship has deteriorated to a point of no return,” said Dr Sameer Malhotra, head of mental health and behavioral sciences at Max Healthcare.It’s no longer just women who are speaking up. “Many men come in crying. Some attempt suicide. Some are completely broken, manipulated, or threatened with legal action. They’re unable to function at work, having emotional breakdowns in the office.”And when people choose to kill others, it's not necessarily on the spur of the moment. Sometimes it's horrifyingly deliberate.“For some, the cause is longstanding anger, frustration, and neglect. For others, it’s sadism, psychopathic traits, control, and domination. There’s a complete lack of remorse,” Dr Malhotra said.Experts collectively testified, when someone kills a partner and hides the body, it reflects emotional coldness and the need to erase the person. These acts are not just about fear—they’re about complete annihilation. They said the person might be involved in careful planning — how to dispose of the body, stuff it in a bag, burn it beyond recognition. These aren’t crimes of passion anymore. It’s a calculation.Rashi Sahai, a clinical psychologist, Max Super Specialty Hospital, is seeing the same pattern emerge.""Such killings are often the product of unresolved trauma, emotional neglect, or a broken sense of self. It's not spontaneous. It builds. And then it shatters,"" she said.Sahai listed the red flags. Four D's that nearly always appear prior to it being too late:But even when they're apparent, few take them seriously.Dr Kriti Bhargava, a clinical psychologist, said what drives someone to commit violence is disturbingly simple: “Punishment is immediate. It offers instant gratification. Walking away takes emotional maturity, and most don’t have it.”For many people, violence appears as justice. Particularly when they feel control is slipping.“A wife asserting independence, or a husband cheating, it shakes their core. It becomes about humiliation. Retaliation.”Men and women kill differently, Dr Bhargava explained. Generally, not always, ""Men tend to kill for power, for entitlement, and for humiliation. Women kill when they are threatened, desperate, or have suffered years of abuse.""And yet, society largely overlooks the male victims — men emotionally battered, manipulated, or shattered behind closed doors.Dr Malhotra is adamant: “Rights come with responsibilities. Men are suffering in silence, and that silence is exploding.”So what can be done?""Couples should be counselled, yes,"" said Sahai, ""but it must be supportive, not punitive. Otherwise, it won't work.""""We need to teach people emotional control, conflict resolution, not merely math and science,"" said Dr Malhotra. “There’s a vacuum of coping skills.”Love's not meant to be lethal. But in Indian homes across this country, too often it's becoming a risky game. A game where defeat in an argument might equal the loss of life.“People don’t listen anymore. They don’t try to understand. Relationships are transactional now, not emotional,” Dr Malhotra said.The question is no longer why someone was killed. It’s why no one saw it coming.","Murders in India are on the rise due to lack of emotional control and communication. Unresolved trauma and prolonged neglect are the main reasons behind the violence. The four D's - danger, deviation, distress and deviation - are the red flags that nearly always appear before violence.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121491287,imgsize-3968547,width-400,resizemode-4/121491287.jpg"
John Tavares' uncertain future with Maple Leafs as free agency looms and changes mount,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/john-tavares-uncertain-future-with-maple-leafs-as-free-agency-looms-and-changes-mount/articleshow/121500451.cms,"The Toronto Maple Leafs face a defining offseason, with John Tavares' future uncertain (Image via AP)

Maple Leafs leave the door open for John Tavares, but change may be inevitable

A major pay cut may be the only path to staying in blue and white







As the Toronto Maple Leafs enter one of their most defining offseasons in recent memory, the focus is shifting squarely onto the status of captain John Tavares. With several key players heading into free agency, the franchise faces a crucial crossroads, and decisions made this summer could reshape the team for years to come.General manager Brad Treliving has confirmed that the team is still considering bringing back the veteran forward. However, he remained tight-lipped when pressed about the specifics of potential contract offers, saying only that “the door is open” regarding John Tavares’ return.The 34-year-old Tavares has expressed a strong desire to stay in Toronto, a city where he’s served as captain since 2019. But in the world of NHL free agency, loyalty often takes a backseat to business — and there are legitimate questions about whether the Leafs are ready to keep that door open long-term.Tavares' performance declined this past season, particularly in the playoffs, where his production lagged when it mattered most. After another early postseason exit — this time in Game 7 of the second round against the Florida Panthers — frustration from both fans and front office staff has reached a boiling point.Tavares is coming off a massive $11 million annual salary, a contract that once symbolized the Maple Leafs' championship aspirations.If he is to stay, a pay cut will likely be necessary. With other stars like Mitch Marner also in contract limbo, every dollar counts.Treliving’s comment leaves the possibility open, but Toronto may decide that a new direction is necessary. “The door is open,” he said — but it's clear that both the organization and the player must compromise for that door to remain open.With a roster packed with talent but no deep playoff runs to show for it, the Leafs are staring down the reality that this group may have peaked. Whether John Tavares is part of the solution or a symbol of what needs to change is the looming question.","The Toronto Maple Leafs face one of their most defining offseasons in recent memory.

"""Typical man"": Josh Allen sparks curiosity among fans with bizarre golf bag ahead of wedding to Hailee Steinfeld",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/typical-man-josh-allen-sparks-curiosity-among-fans-with-bizarre-golf-bag-ahead-of-wedding-to-hailee-steinfeld/articleshow/121501572.cms,"Josh Allen's mysterious bag in wedding week photo with Hailee Steinfeld fuels wild fan theories (Getty Images)

What’s in the bag? Josh Allen’s odd accessory steals spotlight in Hailee Steinfeld wedding buzz







The buzz around the NFL this weekend isn’t about training camps, trades, or touchdowns. Instead, all eyes are on what many are calling the NFL wedding of 2025 — as Buffalo Bills quarterback and reigning NFL MVP Josh Allen prepares to marry actress and fashion icon Hailee Steinfeld . The pair, often spotted hand-in-hand in Hollywood hotspots and front-row at major fashion events, have officially transformed into one of the league’s most high-profile power couples. Now, their whirlwind romance is culminating in a lavish California wedding, drawing media attention from coast to coast.Fresh off throwing “pretty balls” to wide receiver Elijah Moore at the Bills’ offseason OTAs, Allen made a swift exit from practice to fly west — and the paparazzi were hot on his trail. He was seen arriving at the airport, dressed in casual travel gear, hauling an eye-catching Malbon golf bag and a matching nonchalance. The twist? His bag didn’t seem to hold a full set of clubs — just a single, possibly treasured putter.For most folks, that would raise eyebrows. But in Allen’s world, it might just be another day of living the dream. Considering his $330 million NFL status and his growing reputation as a passionate amateur golfer, it’s likely that he already has a full set of clubs waiting at his California estate — the very home where he and Steinfeld got engaged and reportedly spend a good portion of their time.""Typical man"" behavior, some might say — squeezing in one final round before exchanging vows. After all, Allen’s bachelor party reportedly featured exclusive golfing experiences, including a VIP appearance at Tiger Woods’ TGL event in Florida. That lone putter could either be a sentimental favorite or a fresh addition to his gear, but it definitely hints at some pre-wedding swings — possibly his own version of calming nerves before the big day.As for Steinfeld, the Sinners star and rising fashion mogul has seamlessly blended red carpet glam with Allen’s laid-back athletic charm, and together, they’ve become a tabloid favorite. Their relationship has been defined by understated elegance, with neither shying away from the spotlight, yet both guarding their private moments with class.This weekend, however, privacy might be hard to come by. The ceremony is expected to draw an A-list guest list from both the NFL and Hollywood, as the couple celebrates their union under the California sun. It’s a collision of cleats and couture, touchdown passes and timeless romance.Whether or not Allen sneaks in one last putt before “I do,” one thing’s for sure — his next biggest highlight won’t be on a football field, but at the altar with Hailee Steinfeld.Also Read: With the NFL's deepest QB room, is it wise for the Browns to target another experienced quarterback in a trade?","Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen and Hailee Steinfeld are getting married this weekend.

A kiss gone wrong: Travis Kelce’s awkward moment leaves fans cringing

Fans weigh in: “He could do better”





Being in the spotlight comes with its fair share of pressure — just ask Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift , arguably one of the most high-profile celebrity couples in the world. From red carpet appearances to cozy getaways, every gesture they share is captured and dissected by fans and media alike. But sometimes, even the sweetest intentions can go hilariously wrong — and that’s exactly what happened during one of their recent public outings.In a moment that was likely meant to be private and tender, the Kansas City Chiefs tight end, Travis Kelce leaned in to kiss Taylor Swift on the head. However, things didn’t exactly go as planned. Taylor subtly shifted just before the kiss landed, causing Kelce to plant a smooch somewhere in her hair — and leaving him puckered up midair. The brief exchange immediately triggered a wave of secondhand embarrassment for those watching.Not exactly a touchdown moment for Kelce, but to his credit, he tried to recover quickly. He slid behind Taylor and wrapped his arms around her in a back hug — but the damage was done. Taylor didn’t react, and the moment fizzled into what many on social media are now calling an ""awkward PDA blooper.""As expected, the internet had a field day.Some fans felt the kiss mishap revealed an uncomfortable dynamic between the two, while others laughed it off as a harmless misfire. “He could do better,” one commenter wrote, echoing a sentiment that sparked debate across fan forums and TikTok videos.Despite the viral flub, the couple seems to be enjoying some quality downtime away from the spotlight. Reports suggest that Kelce and Swift are spending their offseason days at Kelce’s luxurious $20 million rental in Boca Raton, Florida, possibly with family in tow — a detail that has only fueled speculation about their deepening relationship.While Swifties were hoping for a surprise album drop at the American Music Awards — where Taylor was nominated six times — she skipped the show altogether. No new music, no public appearance, just time spent with Kelce under the Florida sun.Also Read: “Such sexism”: Barbara Walters grilled Taylor Swift on dating history in resurfaced clip as Travis Kelce romance draws fresh scrutiny Yes, the PDA might be a little clumsy at times, but that’s what makes their love story feel real — even when it doesn’t go viral for the right reasons.","Travis Kelce's attempt to kiss Taylor Swift on the head resulted in an awkward moment during a public outing.

Patrick Mahomes says Travis Kelce is working harder than ever heading into 2025 season

Travis Kelce’s unfinished business after Super Bowl loss is fueling his fire





Despite whispers that the 2025-26 season might be “the last ride” for Travis Kelce , Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes isn’t buying it — and he has good reason not to.As Kelce nears his 36th birthday, fans and analysts alike have speculated whether this season could be his swan song. After all, in NFL years, that age often signals the beginning of the end. But according to Mahomes, the future Hall of Famer isn’t showing any signs of slowing down — mentally or physically.Speaking to reporters during a recent media session, Patrick Mahomes was asked whether this year feels like Travis Kelce’s final season. His answer left little room for doubt.“If it's the last ride, you would never know,” Mahomes said. “I mean, the way he's talking about football, the way he's talking about working and trying to be even better this year than he was last year. He doesn't seem like a guy that it's his last ride, like he's tired of the job.”Mahomes added that Kelce is approaching this offseason with renewed energy, emphasizing that his body feels “better than even last year.” The tight end’s motivation, he explained, appears stronger than ever — not just for personal records, but for team success.Kelce’s own words also echo that sentiment. On the New Heights podcast he co-hosts with his brother Jason, Travis admitted that the Chiefs’ recent Super Bowl loss played a big role in his decision to return.“I think I would have thought about it more if we would have won,” Kelce said. “I feel like I owe the guys that I come into the building with a whole lot more effort and focus.”While he admitted he wasn’t at his best during the big game, that disappointment has seemingly turned into fuel for another championship run.Also Read: Did Travis Kelce nearly quit the NFL over mom Donna’s health?

NEW DELHI: India’s batting mainstays Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma, along with ace spinner Ravichandran Ashwin, have retired from Test cricket, while star pacer Mohammed Shami will miss the crucial five-match series in England due to fitness issues.All eyes are now on the Shubman Gill-led Indian side, widely regarded as one of the most inexperienced teams to tour England in recent memory.In the absence of Kohli and Rohit, India's batting line-up appears quite thin in experience. So, could the selectors consider recalling experienced campaigners like Cheteshwar Pujara or Ajinkya Rahane , who are yet to retire from the traditional format, to strengthen the top order?During a recent interview, Pujara was asked whether Gautam Gambhir had reached out to him regarding the England tour.""No, not yet,"" Pujara told Lallantop when asked, ""Have you received a phone call from Gambhir yet?""Also See: PBKS vs RCB IPL Qualifier 1 Live Score The 103-Test veteran expressed his readiness to return if given the opportunity.""I am ready.

Shubman Gill has been handed the responsibility of leading the Indian Test team through a “massive transition” period, with the dynamic Rishabh Pant appointed as his deputy for what is expected to be a stern challenge in English conditions.At just 25, Gill becomes India’s fifth youngest Test captain, following in the footsteps of Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi (21), Sachin Tendulkar (23), Kapil Dev (24), and Ravi Shastri (25). The first Test against England is scheduled to begin on June 20 in Leeds.""Last year or so we have looked at Shubman (for leadership). We are hopeful he is the guy who is going (to take the team forward). It is a high pressure job but he is a terrific player. We wish him all the best,"" said chief selector Ajit Agarkar after announcing the 18-member squad, which included no major surprises.Explaining Pant’s appointment as vice-captain, Agarkar added: ""Pant is one of our best batters in Test cricket over the last four-five years.

On Friday, when he leads the Gujarat Titans (GT) against Mumbai Indians (MI) in the Eliminator at the New PCA Stadium in Mullanpur, it will be the first time Shubman Gill will be playing at his home venue after becoming India's Test captain.Would he get sentimental or act cool about it? Deepinder Chabra, the assistant curator at the Mullanpur Stadium, keeps it crisp. ""Punjabi load nahi lete (Punjabis don't overthink),"" he tells TimesofIndia.com.Chabra, who has given almost two decades of his life to the Punjab Cricket Association (PCA) and has seen India's Test captain when he used to walk out with an oversized helmet and pads, reveals the chat the two had when GT trained at the stadium on Tuesday night.""It's a big honor for us. A cricketer from Punjab has become India's Test captain. Becoming India's Test captain is a huge deal. I told him 'now your image will be in the stadium's galleries next to the likes of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev, Sachin Tendulkar , MS Dhoni, and Virat Kohli. It's a big responsibility, Shubman.' He nodded and replied, 'Will leave no stone unturned to keep that legacy intact,'"" reveals Chabra.Gill's elevation to Test captaincy has attracted a mixed response with many former cricketers not mincing their words on the move.""He has not even secured his place in India's Test XI,"" Srikkanth had told TimesofIndia.com, after the youngster was announced India's captain.But back in Mohali, the vibe is different. Yuvraj Singh , one of Shubman's mentors, was at the Chandigarh airport on Monday to receive the prince of Indian cricket.Former India bowler and national selector Harvinder Singh is ignoring the ""outside noises"" and feels Gill was the right choice for Test captaincy.""I know there are concerns about him being captain. But these are outside noises. There was always a leadership quality in him. Even in our selection panel, we had circled Shubman as India's next captain. So, I am not surprised,"" says Harvinder.""It will be a litmus test for sure. Captaining India for the first time, that too in England. It has been a nightmare tour for many former Indian captains. But it is good. His batsmanship, his leadership, and most importantly, his character will be tested. He will come out a better cricketer at the end of the five-match series,"" adds the former cricketer who has played 3 Tests and 16 ODIs for India.With the Mullanpur venue not available, GT were training at the IS Bindra PCA Stadium in Mohali on Wednesday. The iconic venue where it all started for Gill.Watching GT batters practice in the nets is about watching a lot of Gill’s smooth stroke play. Gill, right from his age-group cricket days, has had an insatiable obsession with spending time in the nets. Spending hours facing the cricket ball is a habit his father Lakhwinder Singh drilled into a young Shubman, and he continues to follow what has worked for him.""At that age, you generally don’t see anyone batting in the nets for so long. Then there was Shubman, who had to be forced out of the nets,” says Gurkeerat Mann.""A lot of credit goes to his father who made him understand that the more he bats in the nets, the longer he will be able to bat in the match. I guess that has become a habit. He is carrying his father’s wisdom with him,” adds Mann.To end the conversation on a lighter note, Chabra reveals another unknown facet about Gill. A trait that has been lesser known to the world.""As a person, he has not changed much. Even now he bats the most in the nets. Above all, 'Munda mahool bana ke rakhta hai (The boy keeps the atmosphere very light).' I have seen him doing pranks on his teammates in his U-16 days, and nothing has changed now,"" says Chabra.Punjab all-rounder Ramandeep Singh, who has known Gill from a very young age, explains the reason behind Gill's stubbornness to bat in the nets.""You will see a different Shubman in every game. Right from a very young age, one thing that was very unique in him was that he was a quick learner. He keeps improving himself. And nets are his second home. He trains until he finds that perfection,"" says Ramandeep.Ramandeep further explains how Gill has worked on his power-hitting in recent years.""He was never a power-hitter. In T20s also, his strike rate used to hover around 120. He used to try to play along the ground. Playing aerial shots was a big no. But now see his six-hitting. It didn’t come naturally to him. He has worked on it at the nets,” says Ramandeep.We will come to know in a few hours whether India's new Test skipper will have a happy homecoming but the hopes and spirits continue to be high in Mohali - the place where it all started for the classy right-hander.","Shubman Gill will lead Gujarat Titans against Mumbai Indians at Mullanpur on Friday. Gill's elevation to Test captaincy has attracted a mixed response with many former cricketers not mincing their words. Yuvraj Singh, one of Gill's mentors, was at the Chandigarh airport on Monday to receive the prince of Indian cricket.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121502461,imgsize-75838,width-400,resizemode-4/121502461.jpg"

Tom Brady thrives post-Gisele Bündchen divorce with Italian flair





Even in retirement, Tom Brady refuses to stay off the scoreboard—on or off the field. Two years after his high-profile divorce from Gisele Bündchen, the NFL legend is rewriting his own playbook, turning heads from Venice, Italy to Las Vegas, Nevada.Tom Brady, who was recently spotted throwing footballs in the narrow streets of Venice, surrounded by a group of admiring Italian women, the NFL legend looked every bit the icon he’s always been. The seven-time Super Bowl champion seemed relaxed and energized—no pads, no stadium, just the streets of Italy and a perfect spiral. The moment felt like a metaphor for his post-NFL life: unconventional, enviable, and still centered around football.While his former partner Gisele Bündchen is forging her own path, Brady’s journey since their 2023 split has been all about reinvention. Beyond becoming the most decorated quarterback in league history, he’s now a powerful media figure and NFL investor.Brady's record-breaking $375 million contract with Fox Sports made waves, solidifying him as the highest-paid sports analyst ever. His debut as a broadcaster was on the grandest stage possible—the Super Bowl—surpassing household names like Greg Olsen and Tony Romo.But Brady’s influence isn’t limited to television. As a minority owner of the Las Vegas Raiders, he’s reportedly taken an active role in shaping the team’s future. The franchise’s recent decisions—including hiring veteran coach Pete Carroll and drafting standout running back Ashton Jeanty—have Brady’s fingerprints all over them.“Tom Brady has already hit a home run with Ashton Jeanty before he takes an NFL snap,” one source noted, hinting at the quarterback's eye for talent and leadership.Also Read: Gisele Bündchen’s $400M empire: How the supermodel rebuilt her life after divorce with Tom Brady and welcomed baby no. 3 Away from the gridiron, Tom Brady’s life has taken on a new rhythm. A single man in his 40s with no more family obligations tied to an NFL calendar, he appears to be enjoying the personal freedom he once sacrificed for football glory.Brady is the only quarterback to lead a team to a 16–0 regular season (2007), became one of four quarterbacks to defeat all 32 teams in 2021, holds the most Pro Bowl selections (15), and was named league MVP three times (2007, 2010, 2017), with his 2010 award being the first unanimous MVP.Whether strolling through Venice or navigating the boardrooms of Fox and the Raiders, Tom Brady has entered a new phase of life—one filled with power, wealth, and, perhaps for the first time, leisure.The GOAT may be off the field, but his impact on the game—and pop culture—remains as potent as ever.","Tom Brady is thriving post-divorce, showcasing his influence beyond the NFL.

Will Howard over Aaron Rodgers — the Steelers’ most polarizing decision yet







The Pittsburgh Steelers, long known for their consistency and playoff presence, are entering a critical turning point. With the 2025 NFL season approaching, the franchise has made a stunning shift at the most important position. Rather than pursue proven veteran Aaron Rodgers, the Steelers appear ready to roll with rookie Will Howard, a sixth-round pick who’s never taken a snap in the NFL.Bleacher Report recently ranked the best quarterback options for Pittsburgh, and the verdict raised eyebrows across the NFL. Will Howard topped the list ahead of Rodgers with analyst Brent Sobleski calling the rookie a “win-win” choice. According to the logic, either Howard shines unexpectedly, or the team’s struggles result in a high 2026 draft pick. For a franchise like Pittsburgh, that thinking is borderline heresy.This isn’t just a coaching decision, it’s a philosophical shift. The Steelers, once allergic to losing, now seem open to the idea if it means solving their long-term quarterback dilemma. It’s a gamble that flirts with tanking, whether the team admits it or not.Aaron Rodgers, though aging, remains one of the few quarterbacks who can elevate a roster overnight. Overlooking him in favor of an untested rookie not only risks on-field failure but could also create tension in the locker room and among the fanbase. Players want to win now. Fans expect it. Is the front office prepared for the fallout?Pittsburgh’s identity has always been about fighting, not folding.But this QB decision suggests the organization might prefer a controlled collapse over continued mediocrity.

One thing’s for sure: the Steelers aren’t just betting on a quarterback. They’re betting their legacy on him.

Parris Campbell's future in doubt after George Pickens trade



Steelers trade WR George Pickens to the Cowboys | NFL Insider breaks down what led to the move

Cowboys face tough roster decisions ahead of 2025 NFL season







The Dallas Cowboys made a big move by trading for wide receiver George Pickens this offseason. This could make their offense much stronger. But with Pickens joining the team, some players might lose their spot. One player who could be affected is Parris Campbell. Fans are wondering if Campbell will stay on the team or if the new addition means changes are coming.T he Cowboys’ trade for George Pickens isn’t just a flashy headline, it’s a decision that may force the team to restructure their wide receiver room. According to Mike Fisher of Athlon Sports, Campbell could be the odd man out when the team finalizes its 53-man roster.“Many in Cowboys Nation were desperate for a more reliable and 'explosive' second-option receiver to CeeDee,” Fisher noted. “You got your wish in the massively important - and risky - trade for George Pickens.”Campbell has quietly built a solid NFL résumé. His best year came in 2022 with the Indianapolis Colts, where he notched 63 receptions for 623 yards and three touchdowns. Overall, he’s recorded 1,117 receiving yards and six career touchdowns, a respectable output considering injury setbacks and limited roles.But in Dallas, opportunity comes with competition. With George Pickens now slotted as a top-tier option alongside CeeDee Lamb and Brandin Cooks, there may not be much room left for Campbell in the Cowboys’ offensive scheme.The Dallas Cowboys' roster is shaping up to be one of the most dynamic in the league but it could come at the cost of losing experienced contributors. Whether Campbell gets released, traded, or somehow manages to fight his way into a backup role, the impact of the George Pickens trade is undeniable.Also Read: Miami Dolphins reluctant to trade Jalen Ramsey due to his expensive contract and trade market challenges As the Cowboys push for a title, these tough calls are part of the game.

Dallas Mavericks considering multiple guard options

What this means for the Mavericks’ future





Theface a critical offseason decision after Kyrie Irving’s ACL injury left their backcourt in disarray. With Irving sidelined until at least January 2026, the team is exploring veteran options, withemerging as a top target.Kyrie Irving’s season-ending ACL injury has forced the Mavericks to reassess their guard rotation. Before the injury, Irving was a key contributor with averages of:- 24.7 points per game- 4.8 rebounds per game- 4.6 assists per gameMedical experts suggest a potential January 2026 return, but no guarantees have been made. This leaves Dallas in a tough spot, especially with Irving’s contract negotiations pending. The team must decide whether to rely on his long-term recovery or seek immediate reinforcements.The Dallas Mavericks have been linked to Chris Paul, who just completed a surprisingly durable season with the San Antonio Spurs. At 40 years old, Paul played all 82 games for the first time in his career, posting solid numbers:NBA insider Marc Stein reports that Dallas sees Chris Paul as an ideal stopgap. His leadership, playmaking, and ability to mentor younger guards make him a strong fit. Additionally, his willingness to accept a veteran minimum deal would help the Mavericks manage their salary cap.While Paul is a leading candidate, the Dallas Mavericks are also exploring other options:- Jrue Holiday (Trade Target) – A proven two-way guard who could bolster Dallas’ defense.- Lonzo Ball (Health-Dependent) – A high-risk, high-reward option if he recovers fully from his knee issues.However, Chris Paul’s durability and experience give him an edge in Dallas’ search for stability.Irving’s injury has forced the Mavericks into a contingency plan. If they sign Paul, they gain a proven floor general who can keep them competitive in the West while Irving recovers. His presence would also ease the pressure on Luka Dončić, allowing the Mavericks to remain playoff contenders.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Golden State Warriors predicted to sign $46,500,000 Dallas Mavericks big man to boost Stephen Curry's title odds The coming weeks will be crucial as Dallas weighs its options.

Strong defenses and smart offenses help Chiefs and Broncos stay in fight

The 2025 NFL season is almost here, and every fan is excited. Some teams look strong. Others still have work to do. This list is about the best all-around teams, the ones with the strongest rosters. Each team was graded by position: quarterback, defense, line, and more. The rankings also looked at injuries and off-season changes. Some good teams like the Commanders and Bengals didn’t make the list. But these ten teams stood out from top to bottom.The Philadelphia Eagles are at number one. They lost some players in free agency, but their core is still strong. Jalen Hurts is protected by a great offensive line. He also has Saquon Barkley and top receivers like A.J. Brown. Even if their defense lost names, they have enough young talent to stay strong. Their roster is deep and well-built.At number two are the Baltimore Ravens. Lamar Jackson leads an offense that added Derrick Henry. Their defense had ups and downs last season but got better at the end. Safety Kyle Hamilton is a star. The rookies they drafted on defense could play big roles. The Ravens don’t have many weak spots. If injuries stay away, they’ll be tough to beat.Third are the Detroit Lions. Talent is in abundance, even besides the new coordinators. Jared Goff had a nice season, and he still has elite weapons in Amon-Ra St. Brown and Jahmyr Gibbs. Their defense should improve as injured players return. Rookie DT Tyleik Williams adds depth. This team could take the next step if the pass rush improves.Also Read: Tom Brady And Patrick Mahomes Could Face Off In LA2028 Olympic Flag Football As NFL Legends Target Gold The Kansas City Chiefs might have lost big in the Super Bowl, but they still rank fourth. Patrick Mahomes leads a new-look offense with fresh receivers. Travis Kelce and Chris Jones still play at a high level. The defense added talent through the draft. If the new players step up, the Chiefs will stay contenders.Buffalo comes next. The Bills didn’t make this list last year, but now they do. Josh Allen is in his prime. The offense has talent at every spot. The defense took some hits, but it’s still good enough to keep games close. Special teams are a concern, but overall, this roster is loaded.The final team on this list is the Denver Broncos. Their defense is elite maybe the best in the league. Bo Nix looked good in his rookie year. Courtland Sutton and Evan Engram help him on offense. There are questions about their running backs, but the O-line is strong. If Nix grows in Year 2, the Broncos could surprise people.The 2025 NFL season has many strong teams, but only a few have the full package. From top to bottom, these 10 teams look ready. Great quarterbacks, deep defenses, and smart front offices make all the difference. Some good teams missed out, but this list shows who’s built to win now.","The 2025 NFL season has many strong teams, but only a few have the full package.

NEW DELHI: One of India's most crucial all-rounders in recent times, Ravindra Jadeja , has revealed that the two most influential figures in his cricketing journey share not just a first name, but also hail from the same state — Bihar.In a candid conversation on the podcast ‘Kutti Stories with Ash’, hosted by teammate Ravichandran Ashwin, Jadeja opened up about how both his childhood coach and his legendary mentor MS Dhoni have been central to his career.""My cricketing journey is between two Mahendras — Mahendra Singh Chauhan and Mahendra Singh Dhoni ,"" Jadeja said. ""I started playing in Jamnagar, at a ground called 'Cricket Bungalow', at the age of 8-9. My coach, who is still training at the same ground, is also from Bihar and his name is Mahendra Singh Chauhan. I have told this to Mahi bhai as well.”Jadeja recalled how Chauhan, a former police officer, laid the foundation for his athleticism and on-field agility.""He used to be a police officer, his mindset was that a sportsperson should be at the peak of his fitness. He used to believe that batting and bowling can be managed but one has to run a lot. My fitness level and fielding skills can be attributed to me running 15-20 kms around Jamnagar,"" Jadeja shared.When Ashwin asked him to describe Dhoni in a single word, Jadeja said, ""There is no one word to describe his greatness. He is on top of everyone.""Both Jadeja and Ashwin played crucial roles under Dhoni — not just for Team India, but also as key bowlers for Chennai Super Kings during the team’s IPL dominance.The discussion also touched upon Virat Kohli , India’s most successful Test captain, who recently stepped away from the longest format. Jadeja lauded Kohli’s unwavering intensity and winning mindset.""It was his positive approach — especially in Tests — the special thing about Virat is that he always wanted the team to pick 20 wickets in a Test match, so he never gives up at all. Be it a three-hour session or 45 overs left, he would still want to pick up all 10 wickets of the opposition,"" Jadeja said.Kohli walked away from Test cricket with an outstanding record — 9,230 runs in 123 matches at an average of 46.85, including 30 centuries and 31 fifties.","Ravindra Jadeja reveals MS Dhoni and Mahendra Singh Chauhan are his two most influential figures in his cricketing journey.

The real reason behind Jalen Ramsey trade deadlock







The Miami Dolphins and Jalen Ramsey saga is quickly turning into one of the most talked-about stories in the NFL. Once a key player in Miami’s defense, Ramsey now faces a turning point. His relationship with the team has become strained, and his big contract is making a trade complicated. But is Miami holding back only because of the money, or is there more to this situation that fans and experts haven’t figured out yet?Jalen Ramsey’s time in Miami is undeniably strained. Rumors swirl that his locker room relationships have soured, and the Dolphins appear ready to move on. Yet, the real obstacle isn’t just about player dynamics, it’s about the massive financial burden Ramsey’s contract places on Miami’s salary cap. The Dolphins are clear: they want to trade Ramsey but refuse to shoulder much of his guaranteed money, creating a complicated dance with potential suitors.ESPN insider Jeremy Fowler shed light on the hold-up, emphasizing that while interest in Ramsey is high, teams are wary of taking on the full financial weight of his deal. This isn’t just a minor negotiation; it’s a power play over millions in guaranteed cash. Miami’s strategy is to wait until after June 1, a date when the NFL’s salary cap rules allow them to free up significant cap space by moving Ramsey.This waiting game has frustrated many, as it delays the inevitable.A dam Schefter’s reports underline this growing impatience, noting that a trade announcement could come as soon as June but won’t be processed until the post-June 1 window opens. Meanwhile, Dolphins coach Mike McDaniel keeps a tight lip on the matter, focusing publicly on the current roster and refusing to elaborate on Ramsey’s uncertain future.Amid all this, Ramsey himself took to social media, trying to defuse fan backlash and clarify his mindset. His message was a rare glimpse into his perspective, he hasn’t lost respect for the cities and fans he’s played for, but he’s clearly ready to turn the page.Also Read: Pittsburgh Steelers risk 2025 season by choosing rookie Will Howard over Aaron Rodgers Whatever happens next, Jalen Ramsey’s Miami chapter is closing amid controversy and financial chess, setting the stage for a high-stakes move that could redefine both the player’s career and the Dolphins’ future defense.

Florida Panthers await 2025 Stanley Cup Final opponent as NHL faces Oilers bias claims,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/florida-panthers-await-2025-stanley-cup-final-opponent-as-nhl-faces-oilers-bias-claims/articleshow/121491732.cms,"Panthers await Stanley Cup Final as NHL schedule sparks Oilers vs. Stars debate (Image via: Getty Images)

When does the 2025 Stanley Cup Final start? Depends on Oilers vs. Stars Game 5



The Florida Panthers have punched their ticket to the 2025 Stanley Cup Final for the third year in a row. But as the Eastern Conference champions wait to see whether they’ll face the Edmonton Oilers or Dallas Stars, NHL fans can’t help but wonder: is the league subtly angling for a Panthers-Oilers rematch? With the Final’s start date hinging on a single game, controversy is already heating up.The start date for Game 1 of the 2025 Stanley Cup Final is still up in the air and it all depends on Thursday night’s Game 5 showdown between the Edmonton Oilers and Dallas Stars. As reported by Sportsnet’s Elliotte Friedman, if the Oilers finish the job and eliminate Dallas, the Stanley Cup Final will begin on June 4. But if the Stars push the series to Game 6, the Final won’t start until June 7.At first glance, it seems like standard scheduling. But many fans aren’t buying it, especially with the Florida Panthers already locked in as the Eastern Conference champions. The question buzzing across hockey circles now is whether the NHL is hoping for a Panthers-Oilers rematch?There’s reason to believe so. The Oilers are led by megastars Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl, two of the most recognizable names in the NHL. Their presence alone guarantees ratings. Add in the fact that Florida and Edmonton clashed in a thrilling seven-game Stanley Cup Final just last year, and you've got the kind of storyline that networks and advertisers dream of.On the other hand, the Dallas Stars, despite being a strong team with a recent Final appearance in 2020, just don’t command the same spotlight.A Dallas win would delay the Stanley Cup Final — a three-day wait that could hurt momentum and viewership.That’s why some fans are raising eyebrows. The league’s decision to link the Final's schedule directly to Edmonton's performance feels a little too convenient. Is the NHL subtly steering the narrative toward a high-revenue, high-drama repeat matchup?Also Read: Toronto Maple Leafs brace for impact; Mitch Marner contract negotiations stall before 2025 free agency Meanwhile, the Florida Panthers remain locked in and focused, knowing full well that whoever they face, McDavid's Oilers or a gritty Stars team, the pressure will be immense. But for longtime fans of the game, this is about more than just prime-time matchups and TV numbers. It’s about fairness, balance, and the soul of playoff hockey. Game 5 which could decide more than just a series airs Thursday at 8 p.m. ET / 6 p.m. MT on Sportsnet and Sportsnet+.","The Florida Panthers have punched their ticket to the 2025 Stanley Cup Final for the third year in a row.

Patrick Mahomes confident as Rashee Rice shows strong signs of recovery ahead of 2025 season





Kansas City Chiefs star Rashee Rice is making headlines as quarterback Patrick Mahomes delivers a promising injury update ahead of OTAs. With fans eager for his return, the wide receiver’s recovery progress has sparked optimism across Chiefs Kingdom. As the 2025 NFL season nears, Rice’s comeback could be a major boost to Kansas City’s offense.Rashee Rice, who suffered a season-ending knee injury in Week 4 of the 2024 season, has been the subject of much speculation regarding his recovery and return. But according to Patrick Mahomes, the rising star is already showing signs that he’s ready to return to peak form.“He looks like Rashee,” Mahomes stated. “He's running routes. He's catching the football. I don't know when we get back into the actual OTAs, how much he'll be able to do, but he's been able to do everything here, as far as running routes and everything like that.”This update comes at a crucial time for Kansas City, as the team begins Organized Team Activities (OTAs) with a revamped wide receiver unit that now includes Xavier Worthy and Hollywood Brown. Rice’s return could significantly boost the Chiefs' offense in their pursuit of a third consecutive Super Bowl title.Although Rice missed the initial OTA sessions (May 27–29), head coach Andy Reid clarified that his absence was due to illness and not related to his knee injury. Reid also highlighted Rice’s strong performance during Phase 2 of the offseason program.Before his injury, Rice was on a breakout path, registering 24 receptions for 288 yards and two touchdowns in just four games. Many analysts believed he was poised to become one of the league’s top young receivers.Also read: Why the NFL’s Olympic flag football plan could be a national embarrassment With the next media viewing window on June 4, fans and analysts alike will be closely watching Rice’s return.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

Delhi Results 2025: 'LinkedIn Lessons' from Brand BJP's win and Brand AAP's loss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-results-2025-linkedin-lessons-from-brand-bjps-win-and-brand-aaps-loss/articleshow/118066797.cms,"AAP: From Disruptor to Establishment to Decline



AAP was the ultimate political startup—the kind that raises Series A, B, and C funding at record speed, becomes a unicorn, and then implodes under its own weight. It was supposed to be the alternative to traditional politics, the fresh face in a crowded market, a party that rejected caste, religion, and dynasty-driven politics.

But somewhere along the way, it stopped being a startup and started behaving like an old-school corporate giant—bloated, bureaucratic, and overconfident.

1) From Lean & Agile to Bureaucratic & Slow

AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach—the political equivalent of a D2C brand shaking up a legacy market.

Over time, it became centralized and top-heavy, with decision-making confined to a handful of leaders. MLAs became inaccessible, the leadership became distant, and ground-level mobilization weakened. No succession planning. Kejriwal remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force.

remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force. The result? Voters saw it as just another party, not the disruptor it once was.

2) A Reputation Built on Ethics, Lost to Scandals

AAP built its brand on fighting corruption—but its own leadership got embroiled in one of the biggest scandals of its time, the liquor policy scam.

Manish Sisodia, Sanjay Singh, and even Kejriwal himself faced corruption allegations, undoing years of anti-corruption positioning.

The Sheesh Mahal controversy—where Kejriwal’s residence was allegedly renovated with ₹45 crore of taxpayer money—completely shattered the “humble leader” narrative.

AAP’s response? Defensive, aggressive, and dismissive. Instead of damage control, it doubled down on denial—a classic PR blunder.

The perception shift was swift and brutal—from “anti-corruption warriors” to just another power-hungry political entity.

3) Ignoring the Middle-Class Voter That Built Its Base

AAP was originally the party of the middle class—frustrated taxpayers who wanted clean governance and economic relief.

Over time, its focus shifted to freebies and populist policies, leaving the middle class feeling ignored.

BJP stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters.

stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters. Kejriwal’s pre-election outreach to the middle class felt forced and last-minute—while BJP had already solidified its positioning.

Takeaway ? A business (or party) that forgets its core customer will eventually lose them.

4) Blaming External Factors Instead of Owning Failures

For 10 years, AAP blamed the Centre, the LG, and opposition parties for everything.

The “victim card” was effective in the early years but wore thin by 2025—voters expected governance, not excuses.

BJP flipped this weakness into an advantage, promising that with a BJP-led government, there would be no Centre-state conflicts, leading to “seamless governance.”

The narrative changed from “AAP vs. BJP” to “AAP vs. Results.” Lesson? Leaders who constantly shift blame instead of delivering solutions lose credibility.

5) Strategic Missteps and Lack of Political Alliances

AAP contested separately from Congress, which led to a split in the anti-BJP vote.

Rahul Gandhi’s direct attacks on Kejriwal made matters worse—AAP was getting hit from both sides.

Internal conflicts weakened the party further. Atishi and Saurabh Bharadwaj were seen as Kejriwal’s successors, but there was no clear transition strategy.

BJP: A Masterclass in Strategic Adaptation

BJP’s 2025 win in Delhi was not a Modi-centric sweep but a well-calibrated organizational comeback. After a lackluster 2024 Lok Sabha performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader.

performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader. Unlike AAP, BJP adapted, restructured, and executed flawlessly.

1) Moving Beyond Modi Dependency

BJP understood that Delhi’s electorate needed a more localized approach.

Instead of making the election about Modi, it focused on governance, urban issues, and direct voter engagement.

No CM face? It didn’t matter. The party projected collective leadership instead of relying on one individual.

By decentralizing its campaign, BJP looked more stable and future-ready.

2) Adopting AAP’s Own Strategies Against It

BJP neutralized AAP’s welfare advantage—promising free electricity, continued subsidies, and additional financial support for women.

Middle-class tax reliefs were announced just before the elections, ensuring they won over voters that AAP had neglected.

The manifesto focused on real urban issues—pollution control, traffic congestion, and infrastructure—exactly what AAP had failed to address convincingly.

Lesson? The best way to beat a competitor is to adopt their strengths while exposing their weaknesses.

3) Letting Congress Do The Attacking



BJP didn’t need to attack AAP aggressively—Rahul Gandhi and Congress did that for them.

By letting AAP and Congress fight it out, BJP consolidated its voter base while the opposition split.

AAP’s credibility suffered more because the attacks came from within the anti-BJP camp.

A strategic win, without unnecessary effort.

4) A Disciplined, Focused, and Well-Executed Campaign

BJP stayed on message, focusing on corruption, governance, and economic stability.

The campaign was structured and well-planned, unlike AAP’s which seemed reactive and disorganized.

The promise to investigate AAP’s corruption cases resonated with voters, reinforcing BJP’s stance on accountability.

In business terms? BJP had a clear marketing strategy, strong brand positioning, and flawless execution.

5) Final Takeaways

Adaptability is key. BJP recalibrated after its 2024 Lok Sabha setbacks, while AAP remained stagnant.

Brand trust is fragile. AAP built its image on honesty but lost credibility due to scandals and mismanagement.

Execution matters more than rhetoric. BJP delivered a disciplined, well-structured campaign.

Leadership succession planning is critical. AAP failed to build second-line leadership, while BJP showcased organizational depth.

Voters reward governance, not excuses. After a decade in power, AAP’s blame game no longer worked.

Politics, like business, rewards those who adapt, execute, and deliver.

Ah, another election, another flood of LinkedIn wisdom posts—where every poll result is a ""case study,"" every political leader is a ""CEO,"" and every campaign is an ""MBA-level lesson in leadership."" Some call it democracy, but on LinkedIn, it’s all about business jargon and corporate analogies.So, let’s break this down the LinkedIn way.BJP, on the other hand, had a structured, disciplined campaign with clear messaging and no internal rifts. In politics and business, a divided team rarely wins.","AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach.

RCB vs PBKS, IPL 2025, Qualifier 1: Quick singles from Mullanpur





NEW DELHI: Punjab Kings’ all-out attacking strategy spectacularly misfired on Thursday as they were bundled out for a paltry 101 by Royal Challengers Bengaluru in Qualifier 1 of IPL 2025 at the Maharaja Yadavindra Singh International Stadium in Mullanpur.On a pitch where hitting through the line was far from easy, Punjab’s gamble to go hard from ball one proved costly. Their innings lasted just 14.1 overs.RCB’s pace trio of Josh Hazlewood (3/21), Bhuvneshwar Kumar (1/17), and Yash Dayal (2/26) set the tone early, before leg-spinner Suyash Sharma (3/17) ran through the middle and lower order with his deceptive googlies.Notably, this was Punjab Kings’ first playoff appearance since 2014 — but it turned into a forgettable one.RCB star Virat Kohli celebrated every wicket with wild energy, and wife Anushka Sharma , watching from the stands, was seen smiling at both Punjab’s sloppy show and Kohli’s animated reactions.The collapse began with in-form opener Priyansh Arya miscuing a cover drive off Dayal. Prabhsimran Singh (18 off 10) followed next over, edging Bhuvneshwar after two cracking boundaries.Skipper Shreyas Iyer — key to PBKS’ success this season — threw his wicket away with an ill-timed slog off Hazlewood, and fellow Aussie Josh Inglis soon fell to a short ball from the same bowler.The middle order panicked, continuing to play risky shots. Marcus Stoinis (26 off 17), Shashank Singh, and debutant Musheer Khan all fell attempting slog sweeps against Suyash’s turning deliveries.While Punjab’s batting failed miserably, they might find some hope in their league-stage win over KKR at the same venue, where they defended 111 on a similarly challenging pitch.","Punjab Kings were bowled out for 101 by Royal Challengers Bengaluru in Qualifier 1 of IPL 2025 at the Maharaja Yadavindra Singh International Stadium in Mullanpur.

Hazlewood, returning from injury, made a stunning impact, dismissing captain Iyer and Josh Inglis in quick succession.Only Marcus Stoinis showed resistance, scoring 26 off 17, before being cleaned up by Suyash Sharma — the young leg-spinner who wrecked PBKS’ middle order with 3 for 17.

Ravens cut ties with Justin Tucker amid legal troubles



The Baltimore Ravens have officially released Justin Tucker, widely regarded as the best kicker in NFL history, amid an ongoing investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct. This unexpected move has sent shockwaves through the league and among fans, dramatically reshaping the Ravens’ roster as they prepare for the new season. While head coach John Harbaugh insists the decision was purely based on football reasons, the timing and surrounding circumstances suggest a far more complicated situation behind the scenes.Justin Tucker’s release marks one of the most surprising roster moves in recent NFL history. Known for his unparalleled accuracy and clutch kicks, Tucker has been a cornerstone of Baltimore’s success for years. However, with multiple sexual misconduct allegations now under investigation by the NFL, the Ravens opted to part ways with their veteran kicker.During Organized Team Activities (OTAs), head coach John Harbaugh described the situation as “complicated” but framed the move as a necessary football decision to prepare the team for the upcoming season.“And like we said, it's multi-layered [and] it's complicated. But in the end, it all comes back to what you have to do to get ready for your team to play the first game,” Harbaugh said, emphasizing the multi-layered nature of the decision.Tucker’s on-field performance had slipped in 2024, his worst professional season to date, but it was the emerging off-field issues that appeared to accelerate Baltimore’s decision. The team’s recent selection of rookie kicker Tyler Loop in the sixth round of the 2025 NFL Draft, along with the signing of undrafted free agent John Hoyland, signaled a clear shift toward rebuilding the kicker position.Also Read: Stefon Diggs viral boat video controversy triggers major backlash, deeply impacting New England Patriots’ reputation Despite the controversy, Tucker has denied all allegations. The Ravens’ move highlights the difficult balance NFL teams must strike between managing legal challenges and maintaining competitive focus.

With participants tumbling, somersaulting, and crashing their way to the bottom, the headline “People sprint to catch a 7-pound wheel of cheese” is technically accurate, but it doesn’t quite capture the madness, tradition, and injuries that define this bizarre British spectacle. So, is it a good headline? That depends on what you’re hoping to convey.The Cheese Rolling Contest is an annual event held on Cooper’s Hill in Brockworth, Gloucestershire. Dating back at least two centuries, and possibly much longer, the race involves competitors hurtling down a 200-yard slope after a large wheel of cheese. The goal? Be the first to reach the bottom and claim the cheese as a prize. It sounds simple, but the event is notorious for its steep incline, dangerous tumbles, and frequent injuries.The hill is so steep that it's nearly impossible to stay upright. Most participants end up tumbling head over heels, colliding with each other or the ground.Gravity takes over quickly, and the cheese, reaching speeds of up to 70 mph, is almost never actually caught. Still, competitors willingly risk sprains, fractures, and concussions for a shot at glory and a round of cheese.This year, German YouTuber Tom Kopke claimed victory for the second year in a row. Shirtless and triumphant, he declared, “I risked my life for this. It’s my cheese. Back to back.” On the women’s side, Ava Sender Logan from London tumbled repeatedly but emerged victorious, saying, “It felt quite long coming down and then I hit my head. I’m fine.” Around them, spectators packed the woods and fences for a glimpse of the chaos.While the event may seem absurd to outsiders, for locals and returning participants, it’s a point of pride and cultural identity. Despite calls to regulate or cancel it over safety concerns, the contest continues to thrive, drawing international competitors and media attention. Volunteers, medics, and long-time residents treat it as an important local tradition","The Cheese Rolling Contest is an annual event held on Cooper’s Hill in Brockworth, Gloucestershire.

BUENOS AIRES: An Argentine court on Thursday declared a mistrial in the case of seven health professionals accused of negligence in the death of soccer legend Diego Maradona , the latest dramatic twist in a trial that has captivated the nation and the soccer world for more than two months.The whiplash decision comes after one of the three judges overseeing the trial stepped down over criticism surrounding her participation in a forthcoming documentary about the case.Her controversial withdrawal compelled the court to either appoint a new judge in her place or to retry the entire case from scratch.On Thursday, the judges decided the latter, effectively turning the clock back on all proceedings in the case that accuses Maradona's medical team of failing to provide adequate care for the soccer star in his final days.The judges ruled there would be a new trial, without specifying when.Julieta Makintach said that she had ""no choice"" but to resign from the case on Tuesday after the prosecutor showed a teaser-trailer for a documentary, Divine Justice, which traces the aftermath of Maradona's death at the age of 60 to the start of the trail, clearly featuring Makintach as a main protagonist.Also read: Diego Maradona trial in doubt after judge steps down Maradona, who led Argentina to the World Cup title in 1986, died on Nov. 25, 2020 on the outskirts of Buenos Aires, days after undergoing surgery for a hematoma that formed between his skull and brain.",Argentine court declares a mistrial in the case of seven health professionals accused of negligence in the death of soccer legend Diego Maradona.

Hero pedicab driver intervenes (again)

Activists say it’s only a matter of time





In a scene straight out of a period drama gone rogue, two carriage horses bolted through Central Park on Monday afternoon, causing injuries and chaos.The mayhem unfolded around 2.30 pm near the Central Park Zoo when a carriage horse named Shadow, spooked while preparing for a passenger ride, slipped out of his bridle and took off first into city traffic near 59th Street, then veering back into the park, where he crashed into a line of parked pedicabs.As Shadow’s panic spread, a second horse joined the runaway. Though neither carriage had passengers at the time, the high-speed stampede injured multiple people, including a driver with a broken wrist, another reportedly kicked in the head, and a third with a broken hand.A quick-thinking pedicab driver, who had also helped stop a runaway horse just a week earlier, once again became an unlikely Central Park cowboy. He pedalled into the chaos to intercept Shadow’s carriage but was kicked during the commotion and suffered a leg injury.“Thankfully, I was not killed. It was too scary,” the heroic driver told The Post, declining to give his name. His pedicab was flipped in the effort, and after helping secure the runaway horse, he even gave Shadow’s injured driver a ride to Mount Sinai West hospital.The incident, the second in just over a week, has reignited the long-running battle between animal rights activists and the city’s carriage horse industry. At a rally outside City Hall on Wednesday, NYCLASS executive director Edita Birnkrant called the event “a miracle” that no one was killed but warned, “The luck is going to run out.”Protesters staged a dramatic demonstration by dousing themselves in fake blood to demand a ban on the “deadly and dangerous” industry. Birnkrant claimed such incidents, ranging from crashes to collapses, have been far too common.","Two carriage horses bolted through Central Park on Monday afternoon, causing injuries and chaos.

BCCI settlement: Supreme Court to hear Byju's insolvency appeals,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/bcci-settlement-supreme-court-to-hear-byjus-insolvency-appeals/articleshow/121498349.cms,"Representative image (Picture credit: IANS)

BENGALURU: The Supreme Court has admitted two appeals in the ongoing insolvency proceedings of Think & Learn, the parent entity of Byju's. The appeals were filed by the company's promoters and cricket body BCCI. The apex court has scheduled the next hearing for July 21.The cases stem from the insolvency application filed by the BCCI, which alleged unpaid dues from Byju's, a former Team India sponsor. However, both BCCI and Byju's claimed that a Rs 158-crore settlement was reached and executed before the constitution of the committee of creditors (CoC). The promoters are seeking withdrawal of the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) based on this pre-CoC agreement.Senior advocate KK Venugopal, appearing for the Byju's promoters, argued that the BCCI settlement was ""fully agreed upon, paid, and formally communicated to the interim resolution professional well before the CoC was constituted."" Supporting the plea, senior counsel Guru Krishna Kumar told the court that the company's US assets are at risk, alleging that the resolution professional withdrew American legal proceedings initiated by Think & Learn against its lenders.The promoters' legal challenge comes after the NCLAT refused to allow the insolvency withdrawal, citing the formation of CoC.The dispute adds a fresh layer to the legal troubles surrounding Byju's, which has been under intense scrutiny from regulators, creditors, and investors over the past year. The July 21 hearing could determine whether Byju's can exit the insolvency process based on the timing and validity of the BCCI settlement.","The Supreme Court has admitted two appeals in the ongoing insolvency proceedings of Think & Learn, the parent entity of Byju's.
