Why Dallas Might Move On from PJ Washington

What PJ Washington Brings to the Table

Thehave been searching for the right move to solidify their roster—and Dallas’ draft-night fortune may have just handed them the perfect opportunity. After the Mavericks landed Duke phenom Cooper Flagg with the No. 1 overall pick, their frontcourt is suddenly overflowing with talent, potentially making key contributor PJ Washington expendable. According to Blue Man Hoop’s Tyler Watts, the Warriors, who desperately need size, defensive versatility, and reliable secondary scoring, this could be the ideal trade target to push them back into title contention.Washington, who played a crucial role in Dallas’ 2024 NBA Finals run, now finds himself in a logjam behind Flagg, Anthony Davis, Dereck Lively II, and Daniel Gafford. With the Mavericks likely looking to consolidate talent, Golden State should pounce—because the 26-year-old forward checks every box the Warriors need filled.Watts laid out the reasoning behind this potential move: ""The Golden State Warriors should trade for PJ Washington after the Cooper Flagg selection created a frontcourt logjam for the Mavericks. Dallas has Dereck Lively II locked in at the five with Anthony Davis at the four. That means playing Flagg at the three. The Mavs have Washington and Daniel Gafford behind them. All five players want significant minutes, and Dallas only has so many available in the frontcourt."" (H/t: Sporting News)- Defensive Flexibility: At 6’7”, he can guard multiple positions and even operate as a small-ball center.- Offensive Reliability: He shoots efficiently (45.3% FG, 38.1% 3PT) and thrives in catch-and-shoot situations.- Playoff Experience: His contributions were key in Dallas’ deep playoff run last season.The Golden State Warriors struggled with two major issues last season:1. Lack of Size: Their frontcourt was often outmatched against bigger teams.2. Scoring Beyond Curry: Secondary scoring options were inconsistent.While the Jimmy Butler trade improved their roster, adding Washington could be the final piece to elevate them back into title contention.Despite his strong season, PJ Washington had a rough finale, going scoreless in 27 minutes during Dallas’ Play-In loss to Memphis. However, his overall production (career-second-best numbers) makes him a valuable trade asset.With Flagg joining an already stacked frontcourt featuring Lively, Davis, and Gafford, Dallas may prioritize consolidating talent rather than keeping Washington as a reserve.- Efficient Offense: Excels in spot-up threes, closeout drives, and rim finishes.- Defensive Toughness: Switchable defender who can handle one-on-one matchups.- Championship Pedigree: Played a major role in a Finals-bound team.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Golden State Warriors predicted to sign $18,001,011 Charlotte Hornets rookie to bolster squad around Stephen Curry and Jimmy Butler and improve title odds The Warriors need one more reliable piece to compete at the highest level.

From NHL starter to unrestricted free agent after serious criminal charges

Once viewed as the future of goaltending in Philadelphia, Carter Hart’s NHL career has taken a dramatic turn amid serious criminal allegations tied to the 2018 Hockey Canada sexual assault scandal. A former standout with the Everett Silvertips and one of Canada’s brightest young stars between the pipes, Hart now finds himself at the center of one of hockey’s most controversial and troubling stories.Born in Sherwood Park, Alberta, Hart was introduced to sports psychology by age 10 and was known for his sharp focus and calm demeanor on the ice.

Known for his vision training, quiet intensity, and technical discipline, he was often compared to Montreal Canadiens legend Carey Price—his childhood idol.Everything changed in early 2024. Hart was placed on indefinite leave by the Flyers in January, with the team citing ""personal reasons."" Days later, London, Ontario police named Hart as one of five players ordered to surrender and face charges related to an alleged sexual assault involving members of Canada’s 2018 World Junior team.On February 5, Hart was officially charged with one count of sexual assault. The allegations stem from an incident that has rocked Hockey Canada and led to national outcry, mass resignations, and suspended funding from the federal government.In the wake of the charges, the Flyers declined to extend a qualifying offer to Hart, making him an unrestricted free agent. He has not returned to professional play since.Also Read: Hockey Canada sexual assault trial timeline: Inside the scandal threatening to change Canadian sports forever As court proceedings unfold, the once-celebrated netminder remains one of the most controversial figures in Canadian hockey—a cautionary tale about how a promising career can unravel amid serious off-ice allegations.","Carter Hart is a rising Canadian goaltender with a reputation for mental toughness and poise.

Kansas City Chiefs advised to target Jalen Ramsey in offseason trade

Should Dolphins KEEP Jalen Ramsey⁉️ + What team has BEST chance to WIN 1st Super Bowl? 🏆| NFL Live

Why Jalen Ramsey is the perfect fit for Chiefs' Super Bowl game plan

The Kansas City Chiefs are entering the 2025 NFL season without the usual championship banner to raise. After falling to the Philadelphia Eagles in February’s Super Bowl, the team faces tough questions about roster depth. Now, one analyst believes a bold trade for Dolphins cornerback Jalen Ramsey could reignite Kansas City’s Super Bowl push.Despite having Patrick Mahomes under center, the Chiefs were outclassed by the Eagles’ star-studded roster in Super Bowl LVIII. With most of their cap tied up in Mahomes, Travis Kelce, and Chris Jones, adding high-end talent is tricky. Still, the team might have enough financial wiggle room to make one more splash and a blockbuster trade could be the answer.During a recent livestream, Bleacher Report’s Mitch Milani made his case: Kansas City should trade for seven-time Pro Bowl cornerback Jalen Ramsey.“(Ramsey) can do everything well,” Milani said. “He can be interchangeable with Trent McDuffie, and he could almost play safety. So just think about the scheme advantage that Jalen Ramsey would provide for the Kansas City Chiefs.”Milani noted how Ramsey’s ability to lock down elite receivers in man coverage could mirror the defensive strategy that helped Kansas City beat the 49ers in Super Bowl LIV.Jalen Ramsey isn’t just a name, he’s a proven game-changer. A three-time first-team All-Pro, Ramsey is entering his age-31 season and the final year of a $72 million contract. With trade rumors swirling and the Dolphins potentially looking to clear cap space, the time for a move is now.For the Chiefs, this is about more than filling a gap, it’s about seizing a short Super Bowl window. Ramsey’s ability to shadow No. 1 receivers, contribute in multiple coverages, and even slide into a safety role makes him a dream fit in Steve Spagnuolo’s defense.Also Read: Deion Sanders’ health concerns draw support from Pacman Jones and Travis Hunter: “God is so good” If Kansas City wants to reclaim the Lombardi Trophy, they’ll need more than Mahomes magic, they’ll need a dominant defense.

A moment of pure emotion eclipses the draft stage

Brooklyn Nets see a versatile frontcourt piece in Wolf

Danny Wolf was picked as the Brooklyn Nets’ 27th overall choice and created a buzz of emotions. But it wasn’t Danny, the towering 7-foot forward, who made headlines—it was his older brother, Jake Wolf, who took center stage. Cameras recorded Jake crying at Barclays Center, and his heartfelt reaction rapidly became a sensation online. This isn’t just about a draft pick—it represents family, hard work, and dreams coming true.The draft night wasn’t solely about Danny Wolf; it was also a significant moment for Jake Wolf, a former player from Washington University in St. Louis. As the announcer proclaimed, “Danny Wolf, Brooklyn Nets,” everything seemed to pause. Jake, surrounded by family at Barclays Center, buried his face in his hands, clearly moved to tears. Monica McNutt from ESPN even remarked during the live coverage that he was “still trying to regain his composure. ” This emotional display soon became dubbed a “generational meme,” marking his entry into viral fame.Danny Wolf’s ascent to the NBA is nothing less than motivational. A towering 7-footer from Glencoe, Illinois, he started his college journey at Yale, where he received first-team All-Ivy League accolades, was named MVP of the Ivy League tournament, and led the league in both rebounds and blocks.After making the switch to Michigan for the 2024–25 season, he played all 37 games, averaging 13.2 points, 9.7 rebounds, 3.6 assists, and 1.4 blocks per game, with an impressive shooting percentage of 49.7% from the field and 33.6% from three-point range. This stellar performance made him the Big Ten’s top rebounder and a second-team All-Big Ten selection.Brooklyn’s choice of Danny Wolf marks their fifth selection in the first round—joining a lineup of guard-oriented picks such as Russian point guard Egor Demin, French wing Nolan Traoré, UNC’s Drake Powell, and Israeli guard Ben Saraf. The front office likes his physicality, court vision and spacing of Wolf, qualities that have turned him into a modern NBA big, a player who can shoot, pass, steal rebounds and defend the rim. Being efficient in pick-and-rolling situations and handling the ball is something that makes people notice the difference, unlike other players of his size.Jake Wolf is no stranger to the competitive side of basketball. Standing tall at 6‑11, he shone at Lake Forest Academy, where he was the team captain and averaged 14 points along with 7 rebounds during his junior year. He then went on to play two seasons at Washington University (2021–2023), participating in 27 games as a freshman and starting 22 as a sophomore. His response on draft night was filled with emotion — it was personal. It captured the essence of pride, dedication, and those late nights spent on the court with Danny.Also Read: Cooper Flagg’s $63 million NBA entry sets the stage for a Dallas Mavericks era built on talent and expectations The entry of Danny Wolf in the NBA draft became a history in itself and it is the emotional and teary reaction of his brother Jake which had jolted hearts.

But, the recommendation got flatly rejected by the company.Describing the situation, she said, “No, I was trying to push the Papi agenda. And they were like, 'Yeah, we can’t do that.' And then Priest was like, ‘What about Mami?’ I was like, Okay, guess I’ll be Mami. I was really set on the Papi thing. I was like, I can be a little s**t stirrer, just be Papi this, Papi that. But they’re like, we just can’t go there. And I was like, 'Okay, I respect that.' Mami’s gonna grow on me, though.”In addition, she has also revealed how she initially hated her husband, Buddy Matthews : “I used to hate him. I think he said this when he was (on Insight). I hated him. I hated him with a passion because I loved Sway, which was a female wrestler, and he was from Melbourne. He came from the back, and he just punched Sway straight in the face. I was like, sir, how dare you? I don’t think I saw him before that, too.”Mami further stated, “I think that was my introduction to Matt Silva at the time. And he punched Sway straight in the face. And then Jimmy Scarlet jumped the barricade and chased him away. And then they had a whole feud and all that. But, yeah, I didn’t like him.”Apart from this, Ripley’s now-iconic name, which blends her real first name with a striking surname, has become a symbol of her fierce, powerhouse persona among the fans and WWE universe since she stepped into the WWE ring.

Poll What do you believe is Devon Conway's biggest strength as a cricketer? Consistency across formats Experience in multiple leagues

With your international pedigree, what advice do you share with young American cricketers in the squad?

What’s your assessment of the playing conditions and competition level in MLC?

Known for his consistency across formats, Devon Conway , the 33-year-old left-hand batter is a key member of the New Zealand cricket team. Born in Johannesburg, Conway has scored 4,675 international runs representing the Black Caps. The left-handed batter made headlines with a double century on his Test debut at Lord’s and was a vital part of New Zealand’s campaign in the 2021 T20 World Cup, where they finished as runners-up.Currently part of the Texas Super Kings squad in Major League Cricket (MLC), Conway brings with him a wealth of experience, having featured in the Indian Premier League with Chennai Super Kings, the SA20 with Joburg Super Kings, and England’s T20 Blast with Somerset.Since making his T20I debut for New Zealand in 2020, Devon Conway has featured in 50 matches, scoring 1,408 runs at an average of 38.05 and a strike rate of 127.76. A reliable presence at the top of the order, Conway has registered 10 half-centuries with a highest score of 99* and has hit 135 fours and 37 sixes in the format.In an interview with TimesofIndia.com , the 33-year-old spoke about the challenges and learning curves of playing in multiple T20 leagues around the world and how he’s using his experience to guide young American talent while pushing for a title with TSK.Playing in the three different competitions has allowed me to adapt my game to suit different surfaces. As we all know, batting on these pitches are very different in America as compared to South Africa and India. So it's a great opportunity for me to get to know different players from around the world, as well as play on different conditions to adapt my game.The thing that stood out the most to me in the cricket culture in the US is how young it is. There is interest, particularly with the youth around at the games. It's great to see that people are coming in and watching and supporting. So that's one thing I've noticed in particular in the US playing cricket.I think the team culture that we have here is great. It's driven from the top, with coach Stephen Fleming and captain Faf du Plessis. I think they allow guys to come into this environment, express themselves, enjoy their cricket, and just be a good person within this group. So we've got a great culture and we all get along really well as a group.The advice I have for the American local players in our squad is just to go out there, express yourself, have fun, try and learn from some of the senior players. We've got a vast amount of experience to talk to. Guys like Faf du Plessis, Marcus Stoinis, guys who have played a lot of cricket throughout their careers. So try and watch how they go about their business, learn from what they do well, and just enjoy the experience.I think the playing conditions are great here at the MLC. We've only played at two venues since this tournament has started, so I'm looking forward to playing in Florida as well as San Francisco. So I'm eagerly waiting to see what the conditions are like, and I think the competitiveness is fantastic. We've come short twice, and we're looking forward to trying to win that trophy this year.","Devon Conway is part of the Texas Super Kings squad in Major League Cricket.

Kylie Kelce’s unexpected postpartum red flag: The urge to cut her hair



Kylie & JWoww on Jersey Shore Duck Phone, Backflips in the Club & Eagles Autism Community | Ep. 24

Kylie Kelce is getting real about a unique and deeply personal sign that tells her something’s off during postpartum recovery and it starts with a haircut. On a recent episode of her Not Gonna Lie podcast, the mom of four revealed the emotional boundary she set with her stylist that helps her recognize when she might need help.Postpartum experiences vary for every mom, but for Kylie Kelce, there's one unusual indicator that things may not be okay: the urge to chop her hair. During a heartfelt chat with guest Jenni ""JWoww"" Farley, Kylie shared that she made a pact with her hairstylist—also her husband Jason Kelce’s barber—not to let her get the classic “mom cut.”“I told her, 'If I ever come to you and ask for a shorter haircut, I need you to, like, take me to the doctor's office,” Kylie said.Kylie, 33, who welcomed her fourth child, daughter Finnley, in March, explained that while she loves her long hair, it becomes a target when she’s overwhelmed, sleepless, and hormonal. “Grounded Kylie knew that was not for her,” she added, recognizing that extreme changes in appearance can sometimes mask deeper emotional challenges.The emotional honesty didn’t end there. Guest Jenni Farley chimed in with her own postpartum regret.“I did the mom cut, and I hated it,” she said. “You knew, like, I have long, beautiful blonde hair. I know I'm not touching this s---.”Kylie went on to acknowledge that she experienced different forms of postpartum emotions with each of her four children—Wyatt, 5, Elliotte, 4, Bennett, 2, and newborn Finnley. “It’s hard to check in with yourself in the moment,” she said.Also Read: NFL star-turned-bachelor Mel Owens sparks controversy over “Younger women only” dating rule Kylie Kelce’s honest reflection on her postpartum journey serves as a powerful reminder that mental health struggles don’t always show up in obvious ways.

"Kyle Van Noy reignites decade-old beef with Aaron Rodgers, promises payback in AFC North clash",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/kyle-van-noy-reignites-decade-old-beef-with-aaron-rodgers-promises-payback-in-afc-north-clash/articleshow/122080142.cms,"Kyle Van Noy's old grudge with Aaron Rodgers is ready to be settled this season (Getty Images)

Van Noy reignites feud with Aaron Rodgers, says it’s ‘payback time’

A decade-old slight has ignited a personal rivalry as Baltimore Ravens linebacker Kyle Van Noy aims for retribution against Aaron Rodgers, now with the Pittsburgh Steelers. Van Noy, harboring a long-standing grudge from their Detroit Lions days, views Rodgers' arrival in the AFC North as an opportunity to finally settle the score.Aaron Rodgers' trade to the Pittsburgh Steelers elicits skepticism, largely due to his age and declining performance since leaving the Packers, compounded by a forgettable stint with the New York Jets. While his ability to elevate an offense is undeniable, his recent struggles spark questions about his potential impact.Rodgers' off-season Costa Rica retreats, intended ""to help him disconnect, detox, and reinvent himself,"" sadly didn't translate to on-field success last year. The Jets, who'd placed significant hopes on him to reignite their franchise, ultimately released him. What was once seen as a potential turning point for New York proved to be ""all just a mirage—one that turned out to be extremely costly for New York.”The arrival of Aaron Rodgers in the AFC North with the Steelers sets the stage for a revived, decade-long rivalry. Kyle Van Noy, the Baltimore Ravens' Pro Bowl linebacker and last season's sack leader, is looking forward to two potential matchups in 2025, aiming to finally address an old score with the quarterback.The inception of this enduring hostility traces back to Van Noy's occupancy with the Detroit Lions. During a particularly luminous play executed by Rodgers, the quarterback uttered some words to Van Noy that left a memorable mark, a memory that has lasted to this day.Van Noy portrayed the incident, stating, ""When I was playing inside linebacker, for whatever reason the D-coordinator, who's actually the D-coordinator of the Steelers, wanted to go Cover-zero all game against Aaron Rodgers, and he caught us and we're like, 'well, we gotta run it,' ended up scoring a touchdown to Jordy Nelson. He ended up walking by and kinda tapped me on my butt, like, 'nice try,' so I gotta get him back for that. That's been there for 10 years.""Despite the lighthearted manner in which Van Noy shared this incident on NFL Network, he remains keenly aware that Rodgers, even with his age and recent dip in performance, represents a formidable offensive threat for the Steelers and a genuine challenge to the Ravens' intentions in the AFC North.Despite Aaron Rodgers' recent 5-9 record over 17 games with the Jets, Van Noy believes Rodgers' time in Pittsburgh will be brief. Van Noy also stated, ""A couple of field goals away from having a winning record, and I still feel like he's slinging the ball around. He has the confidence of anybody."" Regardless of his recent performance, the saying ""once a great, always a threat"" still applies, and the Ravens will need to be extremely careful when facing him.Also Read: Chiefs' Trey Smith exposes Travis Kelce’s behaviour, calls him crazy and psycho","Aaron Rodgers' arrival in the AFC North with the Pittsburgh Steelers sets the stage for a revived, decade-long rivalry.

Jason Kelce 's awkward yoga moment with wife Kylie Kelce goes viral

Former NFL star Jason Kelce found himself in an unanticipated scenario: a session of beach yoga in Sea Isle, primarily attended by women, managed by his wife, Kylie. Despite his witty despise for the practice, which he claims causes physical discomfort, his humorous plight resonated widely with online viewers.Jason Kelce, renowned for his eminent career as a formidable Eagles center, recently came across a novel kind of challenge, distant from the intensity of professional football. He was seen among a gathering of women on a tranquil Sea Isle beach, attempting a yoga class—an activity he openly admitted to hate. This nonchalant predicament, managed by his wife, Kylie, quickly captured an audience who found great amusement in his visibly awkward yet delightful participation.The couple's recent trip to Sea Isle initiated with Kylie's decision to embrace a calm sunrise yoga session by the ocean. Jason, much to his evident reluctance, was convinced to join. Surrounded by a collection of peaceful yogis and led by an enthusiastic instructor, the former lineman appeared distinctly out of his element, a stark disparity to his commanding presence on the gridiron.A video clip from the shoreline perfectly abbreviated the moment.Kylie, with a contagious smile, cheerfully declared, ""Here on the beach in Sea Isle with all these lovely yogis,"" while Jason, displaying a look of mild resignation, added, ""I actually hate yoga."" He went on to explain his strong hatred, stating, ""Every time I do it, I pull muscles. I just think for some reason it's bad for my body."" This candid confession graphically demonstrated his genuine lack of enthusiasm.Jason further conveyed that, antithetical to its intended purpose, yoga, which is typically affiliated with peace and serenity, actually had the opposite effect on him. ""I think the opposite of what yoga's supposed to be yoga is all about tranquility,"" he articulated, underscoring his unique struggle with the discipline. His participation inserted a refreshing blend of wit, honest emotion, and a touch of defiance into the otherwise calm gathering.Also Read: Shannon Sharpe’s ESPN return never happening, says Le Batard as Disney wants no part of rape controversy The online community rapidly reacted, with many complimenting Kylie for ""keeping him humble"" and a significant number expressing a wish to see Jason participate in an entire yoga series. For the duration, the available clips will be sufficient, but there's a strong intuition that Kylie will continue to encourage her husband to explore activities well outside his usual comfort zone.","Former NFL star Jason Kelce found himself in an unanticipated scenario: a session of beach yoga in Sea Isle, primarily attended by women, managed by his wife, Kylie.

NFL rookie quarterback Tommy DeVito is officially living the dream, he’s making $1 million this season, he’s got fans chanting his name at MetLife and he still lives with his parents in New Jersey. His mom makes his bed, does his laundry, and cooks all his meals. DeVito’s not ashamed, either. In fact, he says it’s a “no-brainer.” And fans? They’re either wildly impressed or totally confused.This isn’t a rumor. It’s straight from DeVito himself. The New Jersey native told ESPN he still lives at home in Cedar Grove because:No rent.

Oklahoma City Thunder is banking on a trait that doesn’t show up in shooting percentages

In a surprising twist on Day 2 of the 2025 NBA Draft, the Oklahoma City Thunder, who are the reigning champions, decided to take a gamble on Brooks Barnhizer, a gritty wing from Northwestern. He only managed to play 17 games last season because of a persistent foot injury, but the 6′6″ forward still averaged 17.1 points, 8.8 rebounds, 4.2 assists, 2.3 steals, and 1.1 blocks per game. This pick reflects OKC’s trust in his work ethic and defensive instincts, even though he’s coming into the league on a two-way contract.Barnhizer had some impressive stats in his senior year: across 17 games, he put up an average of 17.1 PPG, 8.8 RPG, 4.2 APG, 2.3 SPG, and 1.1 BPG, playing nearly 37 minutes each game. He also set a program record with seven straight double-doubles, placing him among the top players in the NCAA. Unfortunately, his season came to a sudden stop in January due to a recurring foot injury that kept him out for the remainder of 2024–25.OKC isn't just crunching numbers—they're counting on his defensive toughness. Barnhizer ranked in the 87th percentile defensively as per Synergy and restricted opponents to a low 0.741 points per possession.His pick-and-roll defense is even better, landing in the 92nd percentile. At 6′6″ with a 6′11″ wingspan, his quickness, timing, and anticipation make him a formidable presence—traits that Thunder GM Sam Presti and coach Mark Daigneault really appreciate.On the offensive side, Barnhizer showed efficiency with a 41.4 FG%, but he was inconsistent from three-point range, hitting only 31% and just 26.6% on catch-and-shoot opportunities. His mid-range shot and passing ability are notable—he averaged 4.2 assists per game—but he lacks that explosive speed, and his shooting technique is still a work in progress. Nevertheless, his 76% free-throw shooting indicates he has a solid touch, and the development staff in OKC could help him improve his range.Reports suggest Barnhizer is moving towards a two-way contract with the Thunder. He’ll probably share his time between OKC and the Blue in the G League, in a setup created by coach Kam Woods that reflects the NBA organization. With Thunder mainstays like Aaron Wiggins and Alex Ducas following this trajectory, Barnhizer's defensive adaptability and energy position him well in that growth framework.Also Read: NBA trade news: Los Angeles Lakers climb from No. 55 to No. 36 pick and land Adou Thiero in deal tied to Brooklyn Nets and Minnesota Timberwolves Oklahoma City’s choice of Brooks Barnhizer at No. 44 is a strategic bet on his effort, defensive intelligence, and instincts. Even though a foot injury limited his senior season—and his shooting is still uncertain—his impressive college stats and competitive spirit fit well with Thunder culture. If he develops in OKC’s program and improves his outside shooting, he might become an essential glue player. Regardless, anticipate him to battle for every minute as the season progresses.","Oklahoma City Thunder picked Northwestern's Brooks Barnhizer at No. 44 in the 2025 NBA Draft.

West Indies cricket coach Daren Sammy raised concerns about TV umpire Adrian Holdstock's decision-making during the opening Test against Australia in Barbados, following several controversial reviews on the second day of play. Sammy met with match referee Javagal Srinath on Thursday to discuss his concerns, which stemmed from Holdstock's previous officiating in the ODI series in England.Two crucial decisions particularly troubled the West Indies team. The first involved captain Roston Chase's lbw dismissal off Pat Cummins' bowling, despite what the team believed showed evidence of an inside edge. The second concerned Shai Hope's caught-behind dismissal off Beau Webster, where Alex Carey's catch was ruled clean after review.""We are just trying to find some sort of understanding as to what the process is,"" Sammy said. ""We only hope for consistency. That's all we could ask for. When there is doubt in something, just be consistent across the board.""""I have noticed, especially with this particular umpire, it's something that for me started in England. It's frustrating. I just ask for consistency in the decision-making.""Sammy specifically addressed his concerns about Holdstock's officiating. ""Yeah, look, you don't want to get yourself in a situation where you're wondering about certain umpires. Is there something against this team? But when you see decision after decision, then it raises the question. I know he's here for the series. You don't want to go in a Test match having that doubt.""""So I want to have that conversation as to the process… so we could be all clear. Because, at the end of the day, you don't want to be going into a Test match not trusting the umpires. And that's not what our team is about. So we're just looking for some clarity as to the decisions.""When questioned about filing a formal complaint, Sammy remained noncommittal, stating, ""You'll have to wait and see for that.""Regarding Chase's dismissal, which occurred during a crucial 67-run sixth-wicket partnership with Hope, Sammy noted, ""In our opinion, we saw the ball deviated onto the pad.""Sammy drew comparisons between Hope's dismissal and Travis Head's reprieve from the previous day. ""I'm just saying, judge what you see,"" Sammy said. ""If you see the same thing and one is not out, there is even more doubt on the other one than you give it out. Again, I don't know what he's seen but from the images that we've seen, the decisions are not fair enough for both teams. We're all humans. Mistakes will be made. I just want fairness. ""Australia also experienced a controversial decision when their early morning lbw appeal against Chase was denied. Mitchell Starc questioned the synchronisation between images and audio in the replays.""There's been some interesting ones,"" Starc said. ""Obviously a couple more have gone against the West Indies than us. One for us [against Chase] looked like there was a gap between the bat and the ball, it cost us 40-odd runs, but then a contentious one to then get the wicket.""""As players, you can only ask a question. We don't use the technology to make that decision. It sort of felt like, or looked like, that the Snicko and the images were out of sync to some capacity.""Starc mentioned that the Australian team believed Head's edge to Hope the previous day should have been ruled out.Sammy acknowledged the risks of commenting on match officials and discouraged his players from discussing the decisions. ""We know the rules. We know fines going all across the board,"" he said. ""I don't want them to focus on that. Yes, we're kind of shooting ourselves in the foot by dropping so many catches, but look at the Test match, [us] against our own selves, some of these decisions, and we're still in a position to win.

Canucks face critical decision as Elias Pettersson trade whispers grow louder

As the July 1 deadline looms, the Vancouver Canucks are facing mounting pressure to make a defining choice about the future of their franchise star, Elias Pettersson. Despite public statements suggesting the team is comfortable keeping him, NHL insider Chris Johnston has revealed there are “whispers” around the league that teams are quietly exploring a last-minute trade for the elite center before his no-movement clause (NMC) takes effect.Elias Pettersson signed an eight-year, $92.8 million contract with the Canucks in March 2024, locking him in through 2032. However, the NMC embedded in the deal activates on July 1, giving Vancouver a rapidly closing window to consider their options without requiring his approval.Speaking on TSN’s OverDrive, Johnston explained: “The Canucks certainly are giving off all indications that they are comfortable keeping him. That’s where they’re focused… but there are at least whispers that some teams are trying to get in and see in this last week whether they can use that window to perhaps get the player. This is really the last chance you have at a trade.”Elias Pettersson's declining performance last season—finishing with just 45 points in 64 games, a sharp drop from his 102-point output in 2022-23—has fueled debate over his long-term value.His hefty $11.5 million cap hit only adds to the complexity, making a potential trade difficult for most teams unless salary is retained or exchanged.Yet, for Vancouver, moving Pettersson could offer much-needed flexibility, especially with other roster moves and cap constraints in play. Some analysts speculate that a fresh start for both sides might be on the table, even if the Canucks aren’t openly admitting it.Once the NMC kicks in, any trade will hinge entirely on Pettersson's consent—making this week not just crucial but potentially historic for the franchise.Also Read: NHL Rumors: Blackhawks delay contract extension talks with Connor Bedard despite rising value and strong commitment Whether the Canucks pull the trigger or stay the course, one thing is clear: the Elias Pettersson saga is far from over, and the hockey world is watching closely.","Canucks face critical decision as Elias Pettersson trade whispers grow louder. NHL insider Chris Johnston has revealed there are ‘whispers’ around the league that teams are quietly exploring a last-minute trade for the elite center.

Poll Should Mohammed Siraj focus more on controlling run flow rather than solely aiming for wickets? Yes, controlling run flow is crucial No, wickets are more important

NEW DELHI: Former India spinner Ravichandran Ashwin has raised concerns over Mohammed Siraj ’s performance in the first Test against England at Headingley, Leeds, urging the pacer to focus on controlling the flow of runs rather than solely aiming for wickets. Siraj endured a tough outing, conceding runs at an economy rate of 4.05 and taking just two wickets across both innings.On a surface that offered little assistance to bowlers, Siraj gave away 122 runs in 27 overs in the first innings while claiming two wickets. His struggles continued in the second innings, where he went wicketless in 14 overs and conceded 51 runs.""My only question to Siraj is... can you dry up the run flow? You don't have to pick up wickets. But can you not give away 4-5 runs every over? If runs are being leaked, then you have to bring Bumrah back into the attack. How many dams will Bumrah be able to construct?"" Ashwin said on his YouTube channel.Jasprit Bumrah stood out as India's best bowler in England’s first innings, claiming a five-wicket haul. Prasidh Krishna also picked up three wickets but was expensive, conceding runs at an economy of 6.40.""Also, he gets tired, and his spells are pushed, and by then, partnerships are forged. Or you'd have to go with Jadeja, who has to step in and stem the flow of runs. Prasidh is playing for the first time, and he is inexperienced. So Siraj has to play the bankable role. Remember how Morne Morkel used to bowl 2/43 in 20 overs? That should be his role.In Bazball, you could go for 2/58, I guess. Siraj has to play that role, and if he is effective in it, then it would make a huge difference,"" said Ashwin.The veteran spinner further emphasized that Test cricket is as much about support roles as it is about individual brilliance.""I agree that wicket-taking is important in Test cricket. But in Test cricket, you also bowl for one another. Ishant Sharma used to do it wonderfully. He played the Morkel role very well. He would hold the pressure on one end, and would have given just 40-odd runs after an entire day's play. Of course, I am not asking Siraj to do the same, but regulate the leakage of runs,"" he added.","Former India spinner Ravichandran Ashwin has raised concerns over Mohammed Siraj ’s performance in the first Test against England at Headingley.

Harvansh Singh Pangalia's Instagram bio reads - ""Trying to do better.""A self-confessed Marvel fan, Harvansh takes inspiration from Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man 2, a 2004 movie where Peter Parker first meets the brilliant Otto Octavius. The scientist says, ""You’re Dr. Connor’s student. He tells me you’re brilliant. He also tells me you’re lazy."" Peter’s response is as simple as it is necessary: “Trying to do better. ”""There's something about that scene, that dialogue. Then they repeated the same dialogue 20 years later in 'Spider-Man: No Way Home.' The answer gives me goosebumps,"" Harvansh told TimesofIndia.com from Hove.In the practice match against Young Lions Invitational XI, the 18-year-old showcased his explosive batting prowess with a whirlwind century. Walking in at 251/7, he smashed a rapid 100 off just 52 balls, including nine sixes, propelling India to a massive total of 442/9.In the last 24 hours, Harvansh's friends and family have shared a number of reels and memes featuring him, in which he has been touted as India's next batting sensation.His videos of six-hitting are all over social media feeds.The teenager still doesn't know how he managed to play such a jaw-dropping knock.""I was struggling. The first five balls I faced, I was all at sea, failing to connect a single one. I was batting on 13 off 23 balls. I was just not able to find the gaps, and I was getting frustrated. But then something happened. Something snapped, aap keh sakte ho ki maata aa gayi (you could say I was possessed!),"" Harvansh laughed.Harvansh hails from Gandhidham, a small town in Gujarat's Rann of Kutch. Growing up, he saw his father, Damandeep Singh, and uncle, Kunwarajeet Singh, who played cricket in their town, and interestingly, both of them were wicketkeepers. Now, his family, including his father, is settled in Canada, while Harvansh stayed back in Gandhidham with his mother. Harvansh's father moved to Canada in 2017 and is a truck driver.A couple of years ago, Harvansh visited his father in Brampton. The idea was to spend some quality time with him, but he hardly got to because of his work shifts.""He gets up early at 2:30am as his shifts start at 4am; then he comes back in the evening. We hardly got time to spend with him,"" he said.""Whenever I step out to bat, I see the faces of my mother and father. One lives in Gandhidham, while the other is in Brampton. I feel so bad for my mother. She stayed back so that I could live my dream. They have sacrificed so much for me,"" Harvansh added.Harvansh has promised his father that one day he will bring him back to India. Damandeep shares the confidence in believing that his son will play for India, but like any desi father, he is trying to save money for his son's future if cricket doesn't work out.But little does Damandeep know about his son's mentality. He is determined to reunite his parents, and he feels nothing is going to come in his way.""I admire Yuvraj Singh . I adore his mentality about how he won the World Cup for the country while battling cancer,"" said Harvansh.""The sportsperson I liked the most is the late Kobe Bryant. His Mamba Mentality. No athlete can match his work ethic. He used to train for six to eight hours, which is so inspiring,"" he added.Harvansh feels that after reaching a certain level, it is not the skillset that helps an athlete but their mentality and self-belief. He vows to play Test cricket for India, and Virat Kohli's post-match interview after winning the IPL for RCB in Ahmedabad has a key role to play in it. Virat Kohli had said one can only earn respect by playing Test cricket.""Test ka naam test hai because it tests your character. I love playing four-day cricket. That's the ultimate cricket,"" he said.Harvansh's teammates Vaibhav Sooryavanshi and his India U19 captain Ayush Mhatre have already played in the IPL and have lucrative deals. Harvansh takes inspiration from the duo, but he is more focused on his own game.""They are my friends; Ayush is my best mate in the team. I am happy for them. They do inspire all of us, but everyone has a different path.""""Mera bhi time aayega (My time will come as well),"" he said.India U19 will take on England U19 in the first Youth ODI at Hove on Friday.","India U-19 cricketer Harvansh Singh scored 103 off 52 balls against England's U19 team.

“I’d love to have Joe Burrow”: Bold QB pick shocks fans as Patrick Mahomes gets snubbed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/id-love-to-have-joe-burrow-bold-qb-pick-shocks-fans-as-patrick-mahomes-gets-snubbed/articleshow/122102971.cms,"For Edelman its not about headlines- its about the right fit to run a Patriots-style offense (Image via Getty)

Why Edelman says Burrow fits the Patriots way



Gronk wants Josh Allen as QB1—and It makes total sense



In a surprising twist, Patriots legends Julian Edelman and Rob Gronkowski left Patrick Mahomes off their top quarterback picks when asked who they’d want under center in New England’s system. Despite Mahomes’ Super Bowl rings and jaw-dropping playmaking, both opted for quarterbacks they felt better fit the franchise’s identity. Their reasoning offers a glimpse into what Patriots-style football really demands.Edelman made his pick clear on the Dudes on Dudes podcast: “I’d love to have Joe Burrow.” While he praised Mahomes—“I mean, I love Mahomes”—he emphasized fit over flash. “But our offense is a little different. There’s a little more drop-back pass… I don’t want someone running as much as Mahomes on those third downs. I want them throwing because I want those third downs.”Mahomes, though dominant, doesn't align with Edelman's vision of a precise, pocket-based scheme. The Chiefs QB averaged 4.6 rushes per game in 2024, converting 25 first downs via scrambles—the second-most among all quarterbacks. Edelman’s pick underscores his belief in a traditional, pass-first Patriots setup rooted in timing and control.Rob Gronkowski took a different route, choosing a QB who mirrors his own physicality: Josh Allen. “I love him. He reminds me of myself at QB. That was a no-brainer for me. That was the first QB that popped into my head,” Gronk said. For him, Allen’s rugged style was the perfect match for his vision of dominant football.In 2024, Allen led all quarterbacks with 12 rushing touchdowns and broke 42 tackles on designed runs. Gronk’s comparison isn’t far off—he sees Allen as a fullback with an elite arm, capable of leading an offense with sheer force. It’s a pick that reflects Gronkowski’s own career—explosive, unorthodox, and powerful.Also read: “It’s sad”: Tyreek Hill’s bold Dolphins claim stuns fans as ex-Chiefs star eyes emotional AFC clash While Mahomes remains the NFL’s ultimate wildcard, Edelman and Gronk believe fit matters more than flair.

Chaos Near Obama Residence: Female Secret Service Agents in Shocking Altercation





Former US first lady Michelle Obama has once again addressed the rumours surrounding her marriage with former President Barack Obama, saying the reason behind them seldom being photographed together is simply because they’re “too old for Instagram"".“The fact that people don’t see me going out on a date with my husband sparks rumors of the end of our marriage,” 61-year-old Obama told NPR podcast host Rachel Martin.“It’s like, ‘OK, so we don’t Instagram every minute of our lives. We are 60. We’re 60, y’all,'” she said.“You just are not gonna know what we’re doing every minute of the day.”The former first lady explained that she deliberately went against expectations by choosing not to attend high-profile events, such as former President Jimmy Carter’s funeral and President Donald Trump’s inauguration, and acknowledged that she had to “own it” when her absence drew backlash and further fueled speculation about problems in her marriage.“One of the major decisions I made this year was to stay put and not attend funerals and inaugurations and all the things that I’m supposed to attend,” she said.“That was a part of me using my ambition to say, ‘Let me define what I want to do, apart from what I’m supposed to do, what the world expects of me.’ And I have to own that. Those are my choices,” she added, acknowledging that her choice to stay away had sparked criticism.“Whatever the backlash was, I had to sit in it and own it. But I didn’t regret it, you know? It’s my life now, and I can say that, now,” she said.Michelle Obama has spoken candidly about her family and marriage challenges on her podcast, IMO, which she co-hosts with her brother, Craig Robinson.She also shared how she felt the need to scale back her personal ambitions as both a working mother and the first lady.“As a working mother, I - you know, I think all of that stuff, it kind of cut my ambitions short a little bit. Because I had to make a set of decisions, ‘OK, my husband’s over here, I’ve got these kids over here. I don’t know if I can afford to be ambitious right now. So I have to take a step back,'” she said.Michelle Obama has previously responded to the rumors about her marriage, firmly stating that if they were true, she wouldn’t remain silent.Last month on a podcast ""The Diary of a CEO” Obama told the host Steven Barlett, “If I were having problems with my husband, everybody would know about it. My brother would know it. I’d be problem-solving in public.

Caitlin Clark sidelined by sudden injury as everything changes for the Indiana Fever,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/caitlin-clark-sidelined-by-sudden-injury-as-everything-changes-for-the-indiana-fever/articleshow/122103757.cms,"(Image Source - Getty Images)

Stephanie White reveals cautious day to day approach as Caitlin Clark undergoes MRI

The Indiana Fever experienced a major setback on June 26 when their star Caitlin Clark was ruled out of the game against the Los Angeles Sparks due to an unexpected left groin injury. Just two nights earlier, Clark had made headlines with a jaw-dropping fall in Seattle, and her absence has quickly shifted the team's dynamics. Now, with the Fever's offense in a precarious position and uncertainty hanging over them, everyone is questioning — how serious is this injury?During the Fever's 94–86 win over the Seattle Storm on June 24, Caitlin Clark collapsed in the closing seconds while trying to secure her position—this incident sparked immediate concern. The team updated her status on Thursday morning, confirming she would be sidelined for the Indiana vs. Sparks game due to a left groin injury. This is a tough hit for the Fever, who were sitting at a 7–7 record and depending on Clark’s all-around game to help them rise in the standings.Head Coach Stephanie White confirmed that Clark had an MRI on Wednesday night, describing her condition as ""very much a day-to-day thing.""This cautious method reflects how the Fever dealt with her earlier left quadriceps strain in May, which sidelined her for five games before she had a breakout game with 32 points against the New York Liberty on June 14. But unlike that injury, the extent of the groin strain is still uncertain—raising concerns about how long she could be out this time.The Fever's record stands at just 2–4 during Clark’s six-game absence this season, and the 85–75 loss to Los Angeles on Thursday made it obvious why: the Sparks outscored them 35–17 in the fourth quarter. Star forward Azurá Stevens put up 23 points, with Kelsey Plum adding 21. Indiana found it hard to keep their offensive flow, which shows how much Clark’s presence impacts everything from assists to spacing. To address this, the Fever recently signed Aari McDonald on a hardship contract and parted ways with veteran DeWanna Bonner, hoping to enhance their backcourt.This groin problem comes at a time when the Fever is already struggling. Clark, averaging 18.2 points, 8.9 assists, and 5.6 rebounds over nine starts this season, has been off her game from long range, sinking just 1 of 23 three-pointers in her last three games. As a former Iowa standout and the reigning Rookie of the Year, she’s dealt with leg issues before, but her erratic play only increases the stakes.Caitlin Clark's groin injury could be seen as a minor issue at first glance, but the timing and circumstances really raise some red flags. Since the MRI results haven't been revealed yet, the Fever are in a tough spot, dealing with a ""day-to-day"" situation — and they have to make adjustments on the fly without a player who has previously revolutionized their offense.Also Read: Stephen Curry celebrates Morgan Riley’s Underrated Golf Tour victory after clutch final round at Eisenhower course No matter if she comes back for Friday's game in Dallas or if this issue lasts longer, Indiana has to face the fact that Clark not being there shakes up their young team—and maybe even their hopes for the playoffs.","Caitlin Clark was ruled out of the game against the Los Angeles Sparks due to a left groin injury.

While one was growing up, one's mother often lamented that if one spent as much time poring over textbooks as one did perusing the collective works of Frederick Forsyth, one might have amounted to something worth writing about—instead of writing about worthless things. Tautologies masquerading as jokes aside, Britain, too, has long mastered the art of making its hypocrisy sound like high wit.TakeThere’s a hilarious episode where Jim Hacker and Sir Humphrey Appleby team up to pressurise adirector into pulling an embarrassing interview. Theman initially refuses—until Sir Humphrey gently reminds him that failure to cooperate might result in budget cuts and, more scandalously, the loss of seats at Wimbledon and Royal Ascot. They all then solemnly agree that while themustn’t appear to give in to government pressure, they won’t air the interview due to “security implications.”The brilliance of the scene lies in how comfortable the British—for all their lack of tastebuds—are with poking fun at the very institutions they hold dear. A taxpayer-funded broadcaster that can satirise both the government and itself without missing a beat.But—as brilliant as it is—is perhaps only thesecond greatest contribution to the literary arts.The top spot, without contest, belongs to a former Royal Air Force pilot with an eye for detail and a knack for turning geopolitical chaos into page-turning precision: Frederick Forsyth, who departed for Elysium on June 9.And here’s the kicker: Forsyth might never have become an author at all had it not been for the BBC.Fate—disguised as institutional cowardice—had to intervene so that he could stumble into his true dharma.The story goes that once his flying days were over, Forsyth joined, before moving on to the Beeb.However, disgusted by the BBC’s denial of genocide—a custom in which Albion has shown considerable promise—during the Biafra War, Forsyth quit and began covering the conflict as a freelancer.Freelancing, as every freelancer worth her salt will tell you, leads to penury.Broke, and living on a friend’s sofa he wrote the first manuscript of the book that came to be known asostensibly within only 35 days.was initially rejected because it dealt with a rather sticky subject – the attempted murder of a very much alive Charles De Gaulle – not to mention that the cold, journalistic style of writing, lack of a traditional Herculean hero, overt detailing, and a plot whose ending was preordained.The rest as they say is history.sold over 10 million copies, become the inspiration for two movies, and a race-swapped limited series, but to reduce Forsyth’s legacy tois like calling Bob Dylan merely the poet who wroteIt’s simply one arrow in a quiver full of masterpieces.Forsyth was a masterful storyteller, an author who brought a journalist’s eye-for-detail with a poet’s gift for storytelling without getting into the literary quagmire of a John Le Carre that could alienate those with more limited grasp of the King’s.In fact, today, it’s almost hard to explain to a generation that has grown up on C-Bag, Instagram reels or TikTok videos, the magic that Forsyth produced on his vintage Olympia typewriter (he used them till his death).His attention to detail was legendary and reading his novels wasn’t just a walk through a story but a tour through space-time, a history lesson more enthralling than anything in one’s textbook.Take one’s favouritewhere we move from The Battle of Britain to Vietnam to Milosevic’s Yugoslavia to an unnamed South American republic with dodgy leaders ending on the night of September 10, 2001 with a plot twist that would boggle your mind.In, we meet mercenaries with a plan that it’s almost a CliffNotes on how to carry out aon an African nation. The fact that some mercenaries actually thought they were going to carry out an actual coup bears testimony to its hyperrealism.In, we see the future of Labour politics and Leftism in Britain which will ally with any force inimical to the Western order.In, Forsyth astutely predicts the rise of a Putin-like figure whose expansionist ways will become a threat to Europe if not stopped in time. Unfortunately, Forsyth’s protagonists only exist in the pages of novels whose effete real world versions pale in comparison. Today, as the world grapples with Putin trying to increase his sphere of influence, the book reads like a prophecy.Forsyth’s protagonists are a breed apart—neither the brooding intellectualism of Le Carré’s George Smiley nor the martini-drenched bravado of Ian Fleming’s James Bond. They are men of method, mission, and moral ambiguity—shaped more by bureaucracy and battlefield scars than by tuxedos or existential crises. Take Calvin Dexter, the tunnel rat turned avenger, who channels quiet rage into legal vigilantism, or Cat Shannon, a professional mercenary with a conscience honed in Africa’s cruel geopolitics. Jason Monk, ex-CIA and emotionally flayed by betrayal, stands at the cusp of East-West collapse in Icon.Then there’s Mike Martin, the SAS ghost who reappears across Forsyth’s work—first infiltrating Iraq in, then the Taliban inPaul Devereaux, the cold, calculating CIA man in, is the closest Forsyth comes to a Bond figure—minus the glamour, doubled on ruthlessness.Even the teenage hacker Luke Jennings inis a far cry from traditional spy fiction—a vulnerable savant weaponised by Adrian Weston, a spymaster who knows the game is rigged. They’re professionals in a bureaucratic wilderness, soldiers of shadow wars and moral compromise—proof that in Forsyth’s world, heroism is about precision, not panache.And inForsyth’s memoir is a debrief confirming the many things we already know and a few we didn’t like the fact that he did covert work for MI6, had a dalliance with an East Bloc spy and was part of back-channel talks to de-nuclearise post-Apartheid South Africa.Forsyth’s memoir is not a celebrity confessional—it’s a debrief. He writes of his time as a fighter pilot, his disillusionment with journalism during Biafra, and his covert work for MI6. He describes his writing method with the same precision as his fictional operatives.You finish the book understanding that Frederick Forsyth didn’t write thrillers. He lived them. Then redacted just enough to publish. And in that, Forsyth was a journalist through and through. And maybe reading his books was far more entertaining, if not useful, than reading one’s textbooks.","Frederick Forsyth, a former Royal Air Force pilot with an eye for detail and a knack for turning geopolitical chaos into page-turning precision, died on June 9.

With participants tumbling, somersaulting, and crashing their way to the bottom, the headline “People sprint to catch a 7-pound wheel of cheese” is technically accurate, but it doesn’t quite capture the madness, tradition, and injuries that define this bizarre British spectacle. So, is it a good headline? That depends on what you’re hoping to convey.The Cheese Rolling Contest is an annual event held on Cooper’s Hill in Brockworth, Gloucestershire. Dating back at least two centuries, and possibly much longer, the race involves competitors hurtling down a 200-yard slope after a large wheel of cheese. The goal? Be the first to reach the bottom and claim the cheese as a prize. It sounds simple, but the event is notorious for its steep incline, dangerous tumbles, and frequent injuries.The hill is so steep that it's nearly impossible to stay upright. Most participants end up tumbling head over heels, colliding with each other or the ground.Gravity takes over quickly, and the cheese, reaching speeds of up to 70 mph, is almost never actually caught. Still, competitors willingly risk sprains, fractures, and concussions for a shot at glory and a round of cheese.This year, German YouTuber Tom Kopke claimed victory for the second year in a row. Shirtless and triumphant, he declared, “I risked my life for this. It’s my cheese. Back to back.” On the women’s side, Ava Sender Logan from London tumbled repeatedly but emerged victorious, saying, “It felt quite long coming down and then I hit my head. I’m fine.” Around them, spectators packed the woods and fences for a glimpse of the chaos.While the event may seem absurd to outsiders, for locals and returning participants, it’s a point of pride and cultural identity. Despite calls to regulate or cancel it over safety concerns, the contest continues to thrive, drawing international competitors and media attention. Volunteers, medics, and long-time residents treat it as an important local tradition","The Cheese Rolling Contest is an annual event held on Cooper’s Hill in Brockworth, Gloucestershire.

Poll Do you think the Indian cricket team can bounce back in the remaining Tests against England? Yes, definitely! No, I don't think so. It depends on their performance.

The moment you step out of the Birmingham bus station, plenty of cab drivers yell out, ""paaji, paaji where (brother where to?)"". From the accent, you can make out they are not from India but for them, an Indian face with a beard, wearing shorts and mid-rise sneakers is ""paaji"". A quick right towards the city and there are plenty of industrial buildings with endless graffiti. The locals call it an ""urban scruff"" and the attention to detail in some of the artwork is commendable.The Indian cricket team will be camped in the city for 12 nights and will certainly feel at home because of the ""desi"" touch, and the regular ""paaji, paaji"" calls will certainly be the comfort notes they would be looking for after losing the series opener at Headingley by five wickets. It was a game which India dominated for most periods, it was a game where five India batters scored a ton, it was a game where Jasprit Bumrah picked a five-wicket haul but it turned out to be a game where England chased down a record total to go 1-0 up in the series.Questions raised, shots fired, plenty fired back and the same old script has started to play out, as early as the first Test of the five-match series.A series where Bumrah is expected to play only three Tests and very likely to miss the second game in Birmingham to manage his workload. The Plan B's have to swiftly move into action and when they do, Shubman Gill and Co. need to get their act together for what is going to be a tough road ahead.Coach Gautam Gambhir has maintained that a winning dressing is a happy dressing room. The wins haven't come in the last few Tests - just one in the previous nine - and this is where the players need to have their arms around each other. It is understood that the camaraderie and the mood in the change room is better than what it had been in the past and senior players like KL Rahul and Ravindra Jadeja are taking the lead in keeping the youngsters comfortable.Jadeja has found a new wingman in Kuldeep Yadav for his coffee runs and KL Rahul has been spotted spending a lot of time with the youngsters. He has been taking them out for meals in the evening and continues to hang around with Karnataka boys Karun Nair and Prasidh Krishna. Gill has come across as a very personable leader and while he learns and grows on the job, the acceptance is there and it's important it stays that way.It's no secret that the changing room in Australia wasn't the best place to be and the results not going the side's way further affected the situation. India can't afford a repeat of that in England, at least from a dressing room perspective. The players need to be focussed on the job at hand, and the dressing room vibe will only help them perform to the best of their abilities in the middle.This is a very young and inexperienced Indian squad. Most are playing Test cricket for the first time in this part of the world but they showed that they have enough ammo to keep firing at the opposition. The missed the shots they should have taken, spilled the opportunities which were there for the taking but would now look to take the learnings in their stride and keep the eyes locked on the target - at the Birmingham Test where the ""paaji, paaji"" chants will make them feel like home.","The Indian cricket team will be camped in the city for 12 nights and will certainly feel at home because of the ""desi"" touch.

Poll In your opinion, was Roston Chase's LBW decision justified? Yes, it was justified No, it was not justified

Leeds to Birmingham: On the road with TOI Sports

NEW DELHI: Not one, not two, but three controversial third-umpire decisions became major talking points during the first Test between West Indies and Australia at Kensington Oval in Bridgetown, Barbados. West Indies gained the upper hand on Day 2, with Australia at 92/4 in their second innings, leading by just 82 runs. The match has been punctuated by several contentious calls from third umpire Adrian Holdstock, impacting both sides over the two days.Australia were dismissed for 180 in their first innings, with West Indies replying with 190. The contest remains delicately poised, with Travis Head and Beau Webster currently at the crease for the visitors.The string of controversies began on Day 1 when Travis Head was ruled not out, despite replays suggesting the ball had carried cleanly to the wicketkeeper off Shamar Joseph’s bowling. The third umpire, however, said there was not enough evidence to confirm a clean catch.Another questionable moment came in the first over of Day 2, when Roston Chase survived an LBW appeal off Josh Hazlewood. Despite a clear spike appearing before the ball hit the bat, the third umpire gave the benefit of doubt to Chase.Chase went on to score 44 before falling to another contentious decision. He was adjudged LBW to Pat Cummins, and although he reviewed the decision citing a visible deviation near the bat, the original verdict was upheld.""I disagree with the decision, I disagree with the technology, I thought he hit that but somehow, it's worked against Roston Chase,"" commented Ian Bishop during commentary.""I feel sorry for the officiating team there, in my view that should clearly have been not out. I apologise to the officials, but I'm in total disagreement, as he [Chase] is in bewilderment. You see a deflection, a change of direction of the ball as it approaches the bat. If you've watched the game for long enough, you can see it. If you're new to the game, maybe you don't notice it.""The controversy didn't stop there. Shai Hope was given out caught behind by Alex Carey, even though replays appeared to show the ball may have touched the ground during the catch.Australia now face the task of building a solid partnership on Day 3 to wrest back control of the match.","The first Test between West Indies and Australia continues in Bridgetown.

Spotted in Leeds! Indian Cricket Team Hits the Streets Ahead of 1st Test vs England

Endless coffee runs



The Indian cricket team left for Birmingham from Leeds in a bus on June 25. The entire squad and members of the support staff boarded the coach which was going to cover the around three-hour journey to India's next destination in the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy. Plenty of players travelled with their own pillows for the road trip. KL Rahul took this up a notch with a foldable mattress in the luggage compartment.Upon prodding, it became evident that the batter prefers to carry his own mattress for uniformity in sleep. Are there some health/fitness concerns? Not really. Most players in the squad don't like the hotel beds and Rahul's own arrangement means he doesn't have to deal with the softer hotel beds.The team reached bright and sunny Birmingham on Wednesday (June 25) afternoon. Jasprit Bumrah made a run to the grocery store nearest to the coach station for some essentials. For the rest, it was a day of settling in a luxury hotel.Right from the Champions Trophy in Dubai, head coach Gautam Gambhir and batting coach Sitanshu Kotak have been spotted together during the evening hours. Wednesday was no exception as the duo were spotted strolling around a famous spot in the city.Rest period continues and there are more player sightings in store as the second Test is still some time away.Coffee runs started in Leeds, will continue in Birmingham, move to London then to Manchester before the long summer culminates at The Oval. The players stepped out in groups for coffee in Leeds, meals and it was a regular feature before the series opener got underway at Headingley.The senior players in the setup have been regularly spotted with the youngsters during the time the team is not training or busy with the game.Even before boarding the bus to Birmingham, the likes of Kuldeep Yadav , Karun Nair, Dhruv Jurel, Yashasvi Jaiswal and fielding coach T Dilip ensured to stock up on caffeine before Rishabh Pant and Arshdeep Singh could do their magic with the beats on the bluetooth speaker.India didn't train on Wednesday, have an off day today but there is a possibility of cricketing activity resuming on Friday.",The Indian cricket team left for Birmingham from Leeds in a bus on June 25.
