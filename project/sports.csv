Shedeur Sanders slips to fourth on Browns depth chart as critics say he's collapsing under pressure,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/shedeur-sanders-slips-to-fourth-on-browns-depth-chart-as-critics-say-hes-collapsing-under-pressure/articleshow/121714728.cms,"Shedeur Sanders, once a highly touted prospect, is now battling for a spot on the Cleveland Browns (Getty Images)

From college star to NFL underdog: Shedeur Sanders’ steep fall surprises fans and analysts

Lavish lifestyle clashes with underwhelming depth chart status





Once touted as a surefire first-round pick, Shedeur Sanders now finds himself fighting for relevance on the Cleveland Browns roster. Despite an impressive college resume and an enormous social media following, the son of NFL Hall of Famer Deion Sanders is sitting as the fourth-string quarterback heading into the 2025 season—and critics are not holding back.Sanders’ fall in the NFL Draft shocked fans and analysts alike. He was projected to go shortly after Cam Ward but was ultimately passed over by 31 teams. Even the Browns, who eventually picked him in the fifth round, chose Oregon Ducks QB Dillon Gabriel two rounds earlier—making it clear Shedeur wasn’t the first choice, even within his own team.Now, he's competing in a crowded quarterback room that includes seasoned veterans Joe Flacco and Kenny Pickett, along with fellow rookie Gabriel. According to team sources, the frontrunner for QB1 is Flacco, who led the Browns to the playoffs in 2023. Meanwhile, Sanders remains on the sidelines, raising questions about whether he can live up to the hype he once carried.Off the field, Sanders continues to make headlines—not always for the right reasons. Fox Sports analyst Jason McIntyre didn’t mince words, saying, “Despite all the hype around Shedeur, he's the only Browns quarterback not training with the first team.The guy's motto is 'Be Legendary.' He's throwing these extremely lavish NFL Draft parties. And he's fourth on the depth chart—without a doubt.""The criticism isn’t just about performance; it’s about perception. Many are questioning Sanders’ commitment and focus, especially when his off-field activities seem to overshadow his current on-field struggles.Sanders isn’t without credentials. He led all Big 12 quarterbacks in completion percentage (74%) and threw for over 4,100 yards with 37 touchdowns at Colorado. Those stats earned him national recognition, but they haven’t translated into a strong NFL start—at least not yet.Also Read: $750K gone!

He’ll need to silence critics the old-fashioned way—through performance, patience, and persistence.","Shedeur Sanders is the son of NFL Hall of Famer Deion Sanders.

Wayne Gretzky sparks controversy by accusing Florida Panthers of buying success with tax loopholes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/wayne-gretzky-sparks-controversy-by-accusing-florida-panthers-of-buying-success-with-tax-loopholes/articleshow/121686110.cms,"Hockey legend Wayne Gretzky sparked debate by highlighting financial disparities in the NHL, suggesting that teams in states with no income tax, like the Florida Panthers, have an unfair advantage in attracting talent. Gretzky emphasized the allure of traditional hockey markets like Edmonton, contrasting them with the financial benefits of playing in Florida.

Wayne Gretzky, the face of hockey greatness, has ignited a fierce debate that goes beyond the ice rink—one that’s raising eyebrows across NHL circles and beyond. While appearing on The Pat McAfee Show, ""The Great One"" opened up about the financial disparities in the league, taking subtle aim at how no-state-income-tax franchises like the Florida Panthers might be gaining an upper hand in the talent war.Speaking candidly, the Great One, Wayne Gretzky stated, “Obviously Florida and Tampa Bay is a unique situation…from a financial point of view, if that’s what a player’s thinking about, obviously, but if a player’s thinking, you know, what I want to play in a hockey culture, like playing and living in the city of Edmonton, I loved it for 10 years.”Gretzky’s words struck a chord—highlighting the growing tension between market-driven decisions and hockey's traditional roots. While Florida teams like the Panthers can offer higher take-home pay due to their tax structure, cities like Edmonton offer something money can’t buy: fan intensity and legacy.The Panthers’ on-ice success, including multiple Stanley Cup Final runs, has coincided with the state’s tax-friendly policies, allowing the team to recruit and retain talent without overspending. That advantage, though legal, raises a question of fairness. Could this be undermining the NHL’s competitive balance?Wayne Gretzky didn’t directly accuse teams of exploiting the tax loophole—but his tone was clear.When discussing Edmonton, he reflected, “You leave the arena in Edmonton, you know you’ve been in a hockey game…1.3 million have watched that game and the other 200,000…the only reason they didn’t is because they were working.”In response to the buzz, Panthers head coach Paul Maurice emphasized the area’s growing sports culture and praised efforts to build community over competition. ""I think there’s room for all of us down here, certainly enough people. And I think that it’s a great thing that you have sports that are foundational—football, basketball, baseball, and then the new sport, hockey—and there’s room for everybody there. So how about we just share it? We share the spotlight. ”Maurice also lauded GM Bill Zito’s cross-sport cooperation with the Dolphins and Marlins, saying, “Bill’s been kind of involved. Best practices…our team services people get together, right, to scout out the best of things when we travel.”Also Read: “It took a toll”: Wayne Gretzky's daughter Paulina Gretzky opens up about parenting struggles, body image In the end, Wayne Gretzky’s comments have lit a fuse—pitting hockey tradition against market innovation.

Cam Skattebo's viral moment provokes criticism over NFL history blind spot



Does Cam Skattebo know ball? 🧠

A generation gap or something more?



by face





New York Giants first-year running back Cameron Skattebo became the focus of an unintended NFL tempest—nothing on the field, but for seemingly not knowing anything about the league's greatest legends. In one recent video making its rounds on the internet, Cameron Skattebo can't recognize NFL legends from their pictures, kicking off an emotional Reddit discussion in which fans toggle between anger and empathy.Cameron Skattebo, who played college football at Sacramento State Hornets and Arizona State Sun Devils before the New York Giants drafted him in the fourth round of the 2025 NFL Draft, soon found himself a topic of conversation on Reddit—but not the kind related to his athleticism.In one clip of him now circulating, Cameron Skattebo misidentifies players during a quiz segment. When presented with a picture of Calvin Johnson, better known as ‘Megatron,’ confusion set in.Redditors were both amused and frustrated. One of the top comments stated, “Not knowing Calvin is wild, but an NFL player not knowing Brett Favre is crazy ffs.”Another commenter joked, “Banish him from the league for this,” and others reluctantly empathized, one of them noting, “To be fair, though, Calvin retired when Skattebo woulda been like 13 or 14, and he wasn’t a guy who was in many commercials or broadcast booths.So it’s not thaaaat crazy with all that in mind.”""They’re so disappointed they’re almost speechless by the end lol. The joy fully sucked out of the room,"" another user said.""Well we didn’t teach him memory skills at ASU I guess,"" a fan joked.""Tbf I haven’t seen most of these guys without a helmet on,"" another defended, ""I got Colston and Megatron though.""""This dude off my draft board,"" one Reddit user said to which another replied, ""I imagine Cam needs to watch it again too. Dude looked like he got concussed 4 times during it.""A fan tried to defend Skattebo's 'ignorance' by commenting: ""Calm down guys, memory is hard. I can't even remember the last time the Buffalo Bills won a superbowl.""""As a filthy casual with incredible face blindness I feel seen,"" another added.The discussion soon escalated beyond Cameron Skattebo, with wider questions about how younger players identify with the history of the league. One commenter wrote that most players don't grow up watching the NFL but rather center on their own development or college careers. “A lot of these guys don't even follow the NFL til they get to the league. Might have been a college fan, or just doesn't watch football,” another Redditor wrote.Even fans conceded trouble identifying helmet-wearing players by face alone. “Not really. I wouldn’t recognize Joe Montana from face alone probably. I definitely wouldn’t recognize megatron from face alone. I think people here are forgetting these dudes play in helmets lol. Outside of a handful of players there’s probably not many non-Eagles I could recognize,” admitted one commenter.""I mean, not knowing Golden Tate, Kam Chancellor, and Darren Sprolesis honestly understandable,"" one more added.Nevertheless, the overall opinion was tilted towards incredulity, particularly in light of Johnson's place in NFL legend.While the NFL-Fan base in turn roasted and justified Cameron Skattebo's viral blunder, the moment highlighted something greater—the transience of fame, the changing tides of fandom across generations, and the way legacy players disappear from popular consciousness sooner than we want them to. Skattebo learned this lesson not offered in college: understanding the past can inform how you're perceived in the present.Also Read : Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce delight fans with synchronized dance at Tennessee wedding",New York Giants first-year running back Cameron Skattebo can't recognize NFL legends from their pictures.

Allen Iverson shares posts dedicated to son Isaiah Rahsaan Iverson and wife Tawanna Turner





Former NBA legend, Allen Iverson shares a heartwarming post for his son, Isaiah Rahsaan Iverson on his Instagram. The post contains photos from Isaiah’s childhood, teenage years, and graduation ceremony. Allen went on to praise him saying that he’s the true definition of what a son should be, and the way he always looks out for family is what makes him better than others. He goes on to say how proud of a father he is. However, this post came days after Allen dedicated an entire post for ex-wife, Tawanna Turner.Allen Iverson talks profoundly about his son Isaiah on his recent Instagram post. He talks about Isaiah’s qualities and how he is a son that every father will be proud of.“The true definition of a son,” says Allen as he starts the post, showing how proud he is of Isaiah.Iverson further went on to say how Isaiah takes care of his mother and siblings, and never disrespects his parents. He also went on to say that Isaiah always puts family first and takes responsibility heads on. From his post it seems after Allen and Tawanna separated, it was Isaiah who put on the ""head of the family"" tag and took good care of the family.However, this post comes days after Allen dedicated an entire post to ex-wife Tawanna Turner, with whom he shares five children, Allen Iverson II, Isaiah Rahsaan Iverson, Dream Alijha, Tiaura, and Messiah Lauren. The post had a montage of the couple’s photos from prom, early court days, and as such. Allen captioned the photo as “HER” followed by heart and crossed fingers emoticons.Allen and Tawanna tied the knot in 2001, and had a happy marriage for quite some years. However, trouble entered their married life in the form of lavish expenditures, Iverson’s questionable parenting skills, and alcohol habits. In 2013, when Iverson retired from the world of NBA, his married life also came to an end. The couple called it quits in 2013 and agreed to co-parent their kids. Their divorce made headlines back in 2013 due to all the chaos it unraveled. With Iverson being officially bankrupt and declaring in the court that he doesn't even have money for a cheeseburger to Tawanna literally pulling out $61 from her purse and giving it to the NBA legend, the couple has seen it all. Tawanna has been Iverson's rock through all ups and down, and they still remained friends after the divorce. Iverson even gave a special shoutout to Tawanna in his Hall of Fame speech in 2016.However, it seems Allen’s life turned upside down soon after his lady luck left. After retirement, Allen spent all of his fortune on expensive cars, and lavish lifestyle. Due to this, he became bankrupt by 2015. Despite getting into the Hall of Fame in 2016, life was still in shambles for Iverson. The once NBA legend was back in square one, starting from scratch.Allen was at his top during his time with the Philadelphia 76ers, when he won the MVP of the year in 2001. He also went on to win the Rookie of the Year award in 1997. During the Game 1 of NBA Finals of 2001, Iverson scored 48 points against the Los Angeles Lakers, which was a record in itself. It was during this time that Iverson was the peak of his career, after which his life took a complete 180-degree turn.However, things have started taking turn for Iverson as he recently signed a deal with Reebok and agreed to be the Vice President of basketball division for the brand. He had earlier made a lifetime deal with Reebok back in 2001, which brought him $800,000 per year. The contract also had a clause that stated Iverson will get an additional $32 million at the age of 55. Will the new role help Iverson turn the course of events or will he fall back into old habits? It remains to be seen.Also Read: Carmelo Anthony spilled beans on weirdest reason why Larry Brown suspended LeBron James, Allen Iverson, and Amar’e Stoudemire just before Olympics","NBA legend Allen Iverson shares heartfelt post on his son days after making sweet gesture towards ex-wife.

So I think that it’s mostly that, just knowing that the groundwork has been laid, and I feel good about the position that I’ve left them in. So I feel comfortable with seeing where my passions are able to take me.”LeBron James and Savannah James recently celebrated a new milestone in their second eldest son, Bryce Maximus’ life, who went on to complete his high school in Sierra Canyon.

After days of unrelenting speculation, Vanessa Bryant took to Instagram Stories on Sunday, June 1, to put the rumors to rest. Her response wasn’t a press statement or a legal warning, it was a wild meme with a big middle finger to the internet trolls. The meme featured music icon Rihanna floating in water with a snorkel mask on her head, holding a drink, and flipping her middle finger.“Me protecting my peace, not pregnant & having fun all summer,” Vanessa Bryant wrote in the caption on her response to the online trolls who spread her pregnancy rumors about five years after her husband, Kobe Bryant’s, untimely and devastating demise.It was clear, clever, and vintage Vanessa who shut down noise without saying a word about the origin of the gossip.

'Daring, Dynamic, Different': Ponting hails PBKS young guns despite final loss

Poll Will Punjab Kings bounce back stronger and win the IPL next season? Definitely I don't think so





Punjab Kings fell short of the ultimate prize in the 18th edition of the Indian Premier League by the finest of margins. PBKS lost by six runs in the IPL final to Royal Challengers Bengaluru as Rajat Patidar's RCB claimed their first-ever crown. While Punjab, led by Shreyas Iyer were also in the quest for a maiden crown, it was their rivals that prevailed. Despite the heartbreak in the final, PBKS coach Ricky Ponting attracted praise for his managerial prowess and the relationship he formed with the members of his squad.The former Australian international and legend also showered praise on his side after the defeat in the final, and took pride in the fact that the team showcased something 'different' this year. In a recent clip posted on PBKS's official X handle, the coach takes out his 'funny' side in an interaction with co-owner and Bollywood star Preity Zinta . The latter was urged to do something never seen before by the coach in response to a question regarding his alternating demeanour while representing the franchise.""How does somebody be so aggressive on the ground and as a person, but be so calm and chilled out?"", asked Zinta as she expressed her curiosity on the 50-year-old's behavior on the pitch. The former Australia skipper is know for wearing his heart on his sleeve, but also for his polite and kind nature off of it.Chuckling in response, the coach made a hilarious offer to the co-owner to debunk her assumption.

Look, I'm an aggressive natured person, especially when it's cricket time.""Ponting made headlines for his trust on skipper Shreyas Iyer, who was not retained by Kolkata Knight Riders in 2025, but was made PBKS skipper and ultimately led the franchise to their first final since 2014. Ponting then clarified that he very jolly and cheerful outside of cricket and will have a laugh with anyone regardless. However, he stressed that when it comes to his duty, he makes zero compromises.""I'll have a laugh and a joke and a coffee and a sit down with anyone and talk about anything outside of cricket time. But when it's cricket time, it's my job to bring high performance to this team.

Olympic gold medalist Imane Khelif's medical report reveals she's 'biologically male',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/olympic-gold-medalist-imane-khelifs-medical-report-reveals-shes-biologically-male/articleshow/121566346.cms,"Imane Khelif ’s medical report contradicts IOC’s official position

Controversy around the Imane Khelif’s gold medal at Paris Olympic



IOC calls findings misinformation



Response of World Boxing

Fairness and safety concerns from athletes and federations



Ongoing debate on gender and sport eligibility





A leaked medical report from the 2023 World Championships has revealed that Olympic boxing champion Imane Khelifis biologically male, according to chromosome analysis. The report, made public just days after World Boxing ordered Khelif to undergo sex testing for eligibility in future female competitions, shows she has a male XY karyotype. This revelation challenges the International Olympic Committee’s (IOC) earlier dismissal of such tests and has intensified debate over fairness and safety in women’s boxing. The findings come amid ongoing controversy surrounding Khelif’s participation in women’s events, sparking calls for stricter verification procedures in sport.The report, published on the 3 Wire Sports website, states that Khelif’s chromosome analysis is “abnormal” and confirms a male karyotype. It was conducted by Dr Lal PathLabs in New Delhi, a lab accredited by the American College of Pathologists and certified by the International Organisation for Standardisation. This directly challenges the IOC’s spokesperson Mark Adams, who had described such test results as “ad hoc” and “not legitimate” during a press conference at the Paris Olympics.The controversy surrounding Imane Khelif ’s Olympic gold medal run began as early as her first bout in Paris, where she faced Italy’s Angela Carini.Carini, an experienced and respected boxer, was visibly shaken during the match. Overwhelmed by Khelif’s strength and intensity, she appeared distressed and left the ring in tears after the fight, later telling media she had feared for her safety. The unease only deepened in the final bout, where Khelif defeated Taiwan’s Lin Yu-ting in a dominant display that many felt was physically one-sided. The power difference between the fighters drew sharp criticism, with commentators and athletes calling it “uncomfortable to watch” and likening it to watching a man beat a woman in the ring. The moment became one of the most controversial of the Paris Games, fuelling an international debate over fairness and inclusion in women’s sport.IOC president Thomas Bach dismissed the report as part of a Russian-led misinformation campaign, citing ethical and financial issues within the International Boxing Association (IBA), which conducted the tests. Despite these claims, the legitimacy of the Indian lab’s certification has increased pressure on the IOC to clarify its position and respond to questions about Khelif’s eligibility.Following the leak, World Boxing has declared that Khelif must pass mandatory chromosome testing before competing in any future female events. The 26-year-old Olympic champion, who was allowed to compete in Paris due to her female passport status, has so far not provided evidence to confirm female chromosomes. World Boxing now requires all athletes over 18 in its competitions to undergo PCR genetic testing to verify their sex, a measure introduced in response to this controversy.The case has raised serious safety and fairness concerns within the boxing community. Opponents like Italy’s Angela Carini and Mexico’s Brianda Tamara have spoken out about the physical challenges they faced competing against Khelif. Latin American federations have been particularly vocal, urging that women’s competitions be restricted to athletes assigned female at birth, in order to protect fairness and athlete safety.The Khelif controversy highlights the complex and sensitive issues surrounding transgender and intersex athletes in competitive sport. It underscores the need for clear, consistent policies that balance inclusivity with fairness and safety. As governing bodies reassess their rules, the case remains a key example of the challenges faced in maintaining the integrity of women’s sports.The ongoing debate around Imane Khelif’s case brings to light just how complex and emotionally charged the conversation about gender and eligibility in sport has become. At the heart of it are real athletes — women who train for years and step into the ring expecting fairness. Many feel blindsided and unheard when competing against opponents whose physical attributes raise legitimate concerns about safety and equality. This isn’t about exclusion, but about protecting hard-won opportunities for women in sport. Khelif’s story reminds us that governing bodies must act transparently, thoughtfully, and with empathy for all athletes involved.","Imane Khelif is biologically male, according to chromosome analysis.

“Time to drop the really big bomb:

@realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public.

Have a nice day, DJT!”

Then AB showed up and dropped the tweet of the day



“ngl trump gotta deport elon to south africa after this”





When Elon Musk threw a digital grenade at Donald Trump at 12:40 AM, accusing him of being listed in the Epstein files, the internet was already on fire. But just when you thought the situation couldn’t get any weirder, Antonio Brown, former NFL superstar, self-proclaimed ""CTE king,"" and certified Twitter menace, decided to add his flavor of chaos. And honestly, no one does it quite like AB. From unhinged memes to all-caps declarations, he turned an already wild night into a full-blown digital circus.Let’s rewind a bit. Early Friday morning, Musk shocked everyone by posting this on X:The internet had barely recovered when he followed it up with:“Mark this post for the future. The truth will come out.”No sources, no links just classic Musk cryptic chaos. Naturally, it sent political Twitter, conspiracy theorists, and meme lords into an absolute frenzy.While most athletes would stay far away from that kind of heat, Antonio Brown is not most athletes. Just 16 minutes after the post, he jumped in with this gem:That’s it. That’s the tweet.Wild, hilarious, confusing, and totally AB.NFL fans immediately recognized the signature unpredictability of the former wide receiver. Let’s not forget, this is the same guy who once walked off the field shirtless mid-game, dropped rap singles, and launched his own indoor football team. At this point, AB is like the internet’s wildcard ex, you never know when he’s going to show up, but when he does, it’s gonna be loud.Whether he’s feuding with Tom Brady, launching bizarre business ventures, or weighing in on presidential-level scandals, AB has kept himself relevant in the post-NFL era with the same playbook: chaos and timing. This latest post just proves he’s still got it, the master of the viral moment, even when the moment has nothing to do with him.And honestly, who else would see a Musk vs. Trump digital war, decide to toss in a deportation punchline and somehow make it about themselves, too?While Elon and Trump battle it out over Epstein files and internet secrets, Antonio Brown just reminded the world that no matter the topic, he will always find a way to steal the show.

Clyde Wright's Foundational Impact on Kyle Hendricks' Baseball Development

Kyle Hendricks' Career Trajectory from Chicago Cubs Star to Los Angeles Angels Milestone





Kyle Hendricks’ 100th win in the Major Leagues with the Los Angeles Angels against the Seattle Mariners on June 6, 2025, is not just a statistic. The path of this right-hander to this moment in his career highlights the effect early guidance has on an athlete’s success over many years. By hugging Clyde Wright, the coach who guided him as a child and retired with 100 wins, Hendricks reflected the importance of early guidance for any sports career. Hendricks’ 5-4 victory over the Mariners showed he has what it takes and also highlighted how strong bonds between players help baseball grow.Clyde Wright being part of Kyle Hendricks’ celebration with the Los Angeles Angels made for an incredible 23-year story. When Hendricks started with Wright’s Anaheim pitching academy at age 12, Wright was already a seasoned pitching instructor at 84.Clyde Wright ended his 10-year career in Major League Baseball with 100 wins, just like Kyle Hendricks’ current achievement. The fact that the numbers are equal in this way makes their relationship more meaningful, proving how Wright’s early encouragement of others affected their careers.Hendricks said Wright introduced him to pitching as well as encouraged his passion for baseball, making sure he remained interested in the sport.The way Kyle Hendricks reached 100 career wins shows a strong and consistent performance in different teams and at different stages of his career. In his time with the Cubs, Hendricks achieved 97 victories and was counted on to give accurate pitches, not just powerful ones. He has carried on this style in Los Angeles, and his June 6 game against the Seattle Mariners proved that he relies on strategy instead of sheer strength.Kyle Hendricks showed his tactical skills even though he gave up four runs and eight hits in six innings, with no more than two strikeouts. Even though his fastball was clocked at only 86.6 miles per hour, he handled a potential bases-loaded situation in the fifth inning and got out of it.

R-Truth will no longer be using his longtime WWE name moving forward



“Ron Killings did ask for the name change to his real name as part of his new deal as many had suspected. The advantage is that when the new deal ends he will have had TV time as Ron Killings and can then go straight to using that name on indies and for personal appearances.”





R-Truth is said to no longer be keeping his iconic ring name.The wrestling world was left shocked at the conclusion of the WWE Money in the Bank Premium Live Event. R-Truth, who a week ago had announced his exit, returned to the company following massive support from the fans. The Truth has signed on the dotted line with WWE. However, there is going to be one significant change for the former WWE United States Champion following his spectacular comeback.According to the renowned wrestling journalist, Dave Meltzer, via Figure Four Daily Update, R-Truth will be using his real name, Ron Killings, in WWE moving forward. As per the report, Truth himself asked for the name change to one final true run as a WWE veteran. Moreover, it also stated that he would have used his real name as part of the television programming in WWE. This would allow him to pursue indie bookings once his new deal ended.The report stated,R-Truth's new deal is not a typical talent deal that he had before. It has been reported that he ignored all outreach from WWE following his release. It was after WWE President Nick Khan reached out to him that Truth responded and agreed to come back to the company. The captivating WWE superstar announced a week ago that the company was not going to renew his deal.This faced a major backlash from the fans who started the 'We Want Truth' movement that was prevalent on social media and across all WWE shows. The regime listened to the audience and brought him back within a week. He made his return at Money in the Bank PLE to attack John Cena during his tag team match.

'South Africa didn't beat nobodies'

Bombay Sport Exchange Ep. 6: Harish Thawani on cricket's TV market and the watershed moments

Poll What do you think should be done to improve the WTC format? Increase the duration to four years Require all teams to play each other Adjust the points system





Reigning champions Australia face South Africa in the World Test Championship final at Lord's starting Wednesday amid a chorus of criticism over the competition's format.Wisden, cricket's 'bible', was scathing in its assessment, with editor Lawrence Booth writing in this year's edition that the WTC is a ""shambles masquerading as a showpiece"". Meanwhile, former England captain Michael Atherton said ""everyone knows the WTC in its present guise is flawed"".One fundamental problem is that political tensions mean India and Pakistan, two of cricket's leading nations, have not played a Test against each other since 2007. The nine-nation WTC is further skewed because the teams are not being required to face each other or to play the same number of matches, unlike most sports leagues.Countries are free to decide how many Tests they would like to play in the two-year qualifying cycle - something Booth wants doubled to four years, with the top nine in the rankings all playing each other, home and away, over series that last at least three Tests.Positions are calculated on the percentage of available points won by teams. South Africa have played just 12 Tests in the current cycle - all of them two-match series - compared to England's 22 - and have not played either England or Australia.South Africa also sent a third-string side to New Zealand in early 2024, and lost. It kept its best players at home to appear in its domestic T20 competition. That was a financial sign of the times, as is Cricket South Africa not scheduling any home Tests for 2025/26.South Africa reeled off six straight wins to book their place in this year's final, only for former England captain Michael Vaughan to say they had got there ""on the back of beating pretty much nobody"". But Proteas coach Shukri Conrad objected that South Africa had beaten teams who had beaten the 'Big Three' of India, Australia and England.""One of the nobodies we beat won a Test match in Australia - West Indies beat Australia in a Test match. They are not nobody,"" insisted Conrad. ""New Zealand beat India: three-zip in India. New Zealand is not a nobody. Sri Lanka won Test matches (against England and New Zealand).I don't buy this thing about us beating nobody,"" added ConradVictory in the final would be a boost to South Africa following years of hurt in ICC white-ball tournaments, with Conrad saying after qualification was secured. ""I'm never going to apologise for getting into the final. It's the biggest thing in this team's existence. It's the biggest thing for South African cricket at the moment.""One of those involved in devising the points system, speaking on condition of anonymity, told AFP: ""It's difficult to come up with a solution where everyone is happy given the barriers to an 'orthodox' table that exist, such as the India-Pakistan situation. Commercial considerations will also mean the 'Big Three' will want to play each other in five-Test series.""He added this was just as much a choice as England incurring the over-rate penalties that hampered their chances - they've yet to reach a WTC final despite the first three editions all taking place on home soil - with skipper Ben Stokes almost disdainful in his assessment of an ""utterly confusing"" format.Yet, New Zealand's win in the inaugural 2021 World Test Championship final was welcomed as a long overdue global triumph for a popular side. Australia's failure to qualify for that match was labelled a ""big missed opportunity"" by skipper Pat Cummins, who made amends with victory at in an Oval final two years ago.That India were beaten finalists in both the 2021 and 2023 WTC finals indicated there was still a place for the five-day game in world cricket's economic powerhouse, for all T20 events such as the Indian Premier League are the financial driving force.Indeed former India captain and batting star Virat Kohli, speaking after securing his long-awaited first IPL title following Royal Challengers Bengaluru's triumph in last Tuesday's final, said: ""If you want to earn respect in world cricket all over, take up Test cricket and give your heart and soul to it.""But the awkward question for cricket chiefs is whether the WTC is helping or hindering that aim.",Cricket's 'bible' slams WTC as a'shambles masquerading as a showpiece' World Test Championship final between Australia and South Africa starts Wednesday.

Even as Indiana tried to respond, the Thunder held firm. Unlike the tight Game 1, there was no late rally. The Thunder were never seriously threatened, and the noise inside Paycom Center reflected that confidence, hitting over 100 decibels throughout the night.“We used the opportunity to get better,” Gilgeous-Alexander said on ABC after the win. “We've done a really good job of that all year.” He also added, “We did some things good tonight, we did some things bad. We've gotta be able to get better and get ready for Game 3.”The Thunder got huge contributions off the bench as well.

Former Indian all-rounder Ravichandran Ashwin found himself at the center of controversy during a Tamil Nadu Premier League (TNPL) 2025 match between Dindigul Dragons and IDream Tiruppur Tamizhans on Sunday at the SNR College Cricket Ground in Coimbatore.Ashwin, captaining the Dindigul Dragons, opened the innings but was dismissed for just 18 off the bowling of his counterpart, R Sai Kishore. What followed turned the spotlight firmly on the former India star.Ashwin was adjudged LBW on the fifth ball of the fifth over, but the decision didn’t sit well with him. Convinced that the delivery had pitched outside leg stump, Ashwin immediately approached the on-field umpire — a female official named Kritika — to argue his case.The moment was captured on video and has since gone viral, showing Ashwin pointing animatedly toward the pitch, trying to explain that the ball had pitched well outside leg. The umpire, however, stood by her decision and turned away. Frustrated, Ashwin stormed off, hitting his pads forcefully with his bat.Replay footage appeared to support Ashwin’s claim, showing the ball pitching outside the leg-stump line. Fans online expressed sympathy for the 38-year-old, who is coming off a difficult IPL 2025 season with Chennai Super Kings , where he managed only seven wickets in nine matches at an average of 40.42.Ashwin's frustrations were compounded as Dindigul Dragons collapsed for just 93 in 16.2 overs. Tiruppur’s bowlers, led by Esakkimuthu (4/26), dominated proceedings.

Wayne Gretzky’s past support of Donald Trump sparks criticism—and vandalism

Fans defend The Great One and focus on his legacy





As the Edmonton Oilers chase their first Stanley Cup title since the Gretzky era, some fans are revisiting a controversy that’s been simmering in the background—Wayne Gretzky’s open ties to Donald Trump. But for many in Edmonton, politics are taking a backseat to playoff pride.Earlier this year, Wayne Gretzky found himself at the center of political backlash after appearing at Donald Trump’s inauguration alongside his wife Janet Jones. He had previously been seen socializing with Trump at Mar-a-Lago and even appeared to give a thumbs-up to Team USA as honorary captain during the 4 Nations Face-Off. The optics didn’t sit well with many Canadians—especially after Trump suggested Canada could become the “51st state” of the U.S.The fallout was swift. A petition to rename Wayne Gretzky Drive garnered over 14,000 signatures, and a statue of the hockey legend outside Rogers Place was smeared with what smelled like feces. Security fences were later added to protect the statue from further vandalism.Despite the controversy, local support for Gretzky remains strong—especially as the Oilers try to capture their sixth Stanley Cup. “Let’s forget about the past.What he did here was a lot for the city, a lot for hockey,” said Craig Hiscock, who was seen taking a photo with Gretzky’s statue ahead of Game 1.Longtime fans like Brian Foulken echoed the sentiment. “At the end of the day, (Gretzky) played here for a long time. The diehard Oilers (fans), we love him,” he said. Darren Rogers added that Gretzky’s leadership and records outweigh his political appearances: “Politics aside, that accomplishment should matter more.”Now 64, Gretzky is still learning about the new culture surrounding the game. After Edmonton’s Game 1 overtime win, he was puzzled by the team’s latest post-game tradition. “Pink Pony—is that a band or is that a song?” he asked on TNT Sports, referring to Chappell Roan’s viral hit.“It’s the new generation, Wayne,” replied Paul Bissonnette. Smiling, Gretzky responded, “I gotta get that (as) my ringtone.”Also Read: Wayne Gretzky sparks controversy by accusing Florida Panthers of buying success with tax loopholes","Fans defend The Great One and focus on his legacy as the Edmonton Oilers chase their first Stanley Cup title since the Gretzky era.

NEW DELHI: World No.1 Magnus Carlsen secured his record-extending seventh Norway Chess title in Stavanger, but not without drama. The title was ultimately decided by Indian prodigy and world champion D Gukesh’s loss to American Grandmaster Fabiano Caruana in the final round.Carlsen, who drew his final-round game against Arjun Erigaisi from an unfavourable position, finished the tournament with 16 points. Caruana took second place with 15.5, while Gukesh settled for third with 14.5. Arjun, another standout Indian performer, ended fifth with 12.5 points.Speaking after the tournament, Carlsen acknowledged the rising stature of the young Indian talents but offered a measured perspective. ""They are all very good (Gukesh and Arjun), but they still need a little bit of time to prepare,"" Carlsen told ANI. “We also have a tournament running simultaneously in Armenia, where Pragg (R Praggnanandhaa) and Aravindh Chithambaram showed very good chess.”Reflecting on his own journey through the rollercoaster tournament, Carlsen admitted, “I feel great. It is a relief to win the tournament. In the end, it was such a rollercoaster, but it is good.”One game that particularly stood out for the five-time world chess champion was his shocking loss to Gukesh earlier in the tournament — a rare moment of vulnerability that even saw Carlsen vent his frustration on the board.“It is not a positive memory, but the game that will stick out is the game against Gukesh,” he admitted.As for Gukesh, the 17-year-old's heartbreaking loss to Caruana came after a desperate bid to recover from a tough position. Running out of time, he resigned with just two seconds left on the clock and covered his face in frustration — a moment that underscored both his promise and his growing pains at the highest level.",Magnus Carlsen wins seventh Norway Chess title in Stavanger.

Poll Who do you think should open alongside Usman Khawaja in the WTC final? Marnus Labuschagne Travis Head Sam Konstas





Australian opener Usman Khawaja , 38, discussed his retirement plans ahead of the World Test Championship final against South Africa at Lord's on Wednesday. The veteran batsman, who has scored the most runs (1,422) for Australia in the ongoing WTC cycle, has taken on increased responsibility at the top of the order following David Warner's retirement in January last year. His consistent performance has been crucial for the Australian team during this period.Khawaja emphasized that he will retire gracefully when the time comes while maintaining that age is irrelevant as long as he continues to perform and enjoy the game.""To me, age is irrelevant. If I'm still enjoying my game, still training really hard, I'm still scoring runs, still contributing to the team where I can, I've still got the hunger. I don't really think of anything as different, but I'm very open,"" Khawaja told ICC Digital at Lord's.""I'm really just enjoying my cricket at the moment. Everything that has a beginning has an end. I don't know when that end will be, but for me it's all about staying in the moment, enjoying it one Test match at a time, one series at a time. And when it's time to hang up the boots, I'll gracefully do that, whatever it be,"" he added.Australia has experimented with various opening partners for Khawaja since Warner's departure, including Steve Smith, Nathan McSweeney, Travis Head, and Sam Konstas. There are speculations that Marnus Labuschagne might be promoted from his number three position to open alongside Khawaja in the final.Konstas, who performed impressively against India in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, is also training with the squad in London and remains a potential candidate for the opening position.Khawaja remains focused on his own game despite the uncertainty surrounding his opening partner. When asked if the lack of clarity affects his mindset, he responded: ""Not really, to be honest. Opening is so tough. I'm worried about how the ball is going to bowl to me and what I need to do. The opposite, whoever's opening with me is thinking exactly the same. Then we're kind of in the middle working together on how we're going to blunt out this attack. """"It doesn't really change my game too much. If anything, the change was probably a little bit quieter without Davey. But for me, it's just about what I need to do for my team and then where I need to work with my partner while I'm out there,"" he concluded.","Usman Khawaja has scored the most runs (1,422) for Australia in the ongoing WTC cycle.

From balance to brute force – How Saquon Barkley changed the playbook



Strategic pivot fueled by elite O-line and Barkley’s brilliance

Kellen Moore banks on Barkley to drive 2025 offense





The Philadelphia Eagles are set to double down on their ground-and-pound identity in the 2025 NFL season, with Saquon Barkley poised to retain a central role in the offense. Following a career-best 2024 campaign, Barkley’s dominance has prompted the team to fully commit to a run-first philosophy, anchored by one of the league’s most formidable offensive lines.The shift began mid-season in 2024, as the Eagles transitioned from a more balanced scheme to one that heavily leaned on Barkley’s explosive playmaking. The results were undeniable, Barkley finished with over 2,000 rushing yards, 13 touchdowns, and led the NFL in 10+ yard runs. His consistency and big-play ability transformed the offense’s rhythm and reliability.This organizational change was fueled by a strategic realignment. NFL analyst Greg Cosell pointed out how the franchise evolved to center its offense around Barkley’s strengths. ""That’s the way they started out a year ago... then they made an organizational decision that we need to give the ball to Saquon Barkley and have him run behind the best run-blocking O-line in football.""While Jalen Hurts remains a vital component under center, the quarterback himself acknowledged that the focus is firmly on winning, regardless of who racks up the stats.""You know it doesn't matter how we win... It's all about winning. That’s the only thing that’s gotten us to this point.""Hurts’ ability to adapt to this shift not only reflects his leadership but also underscores the team’s unified culture. With offensive coordinator Kellen Moore now at the helm, the plan is to continue building on last year’s success by keeping the ground game at the heart of the system.""Saquon is a premier running back, first and foremost. We're really excited about his ability to run the football.""Also read: Aaron Rodgers sparks controversy with bizarre anti-Bluetooth theory after signing $19.5M Steelers deal Moore’s comments reaffirm that Barkley will be the engine powering the Eagles’ offense, especially as the team looks to return to the Super Bowl with a physical, time-controlling style of play.

Alcaraz vs Sinner or Federer vs Nadal?





: Coming into the French Open final, the one question that had not been answered in the bubbling rivalry between Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner was how would they hold up with a major title on the line. They had showcased their class progressionally in the Round of 16, the quarters and the semi-finals.On Sunday, they took that up multifold with a five-hour 29-minute classic that became the longest Roland Garros final in the Open Era. A running forehand down the line winner later, it was Alcaraz who kept his flawless record in major finals alive.The Spaniard came from two sets down to win 4-6, 6-7, 6-4, 7-6, 7-6 to stage a comeback for the history books. In what transpired as the second-longest Grand Slam final since 1968, when the Open Era began, Alcaraz saved three championship points while serving at 3-5 (0-40) in the fourth set.In the decider, Alcaraz led 5-3, got broken, and needed a super tie-break to become only the third man this century - after Gustavo Kuerten and Rafael Nadal - to defend the French Open title. He also became just the third man in the Open Era - after Gaston Gaudio and Novak Djokovic - to save a championship point enroute to a Grand Slam title.The match of extremely small, razor thin margins had Sinner win 193 of the 385 total points while Alcaraz, who won his fifth Grand Slam title, had one less.""This was the most exciting match that I've played so far without a doubt,"" said Alcaraz. ""I think the match had everything.""""Today was all about believing in myself. Never doubted myself today and I tried to go for it,"" he said. ""Real champions are made in those situations,"" he added.After two hours and 12 minutes, Sinner led the match by two sets and the points breakdown by nine (82-73).As the match progressed, ticking past the four-hour mark, another powerful stat emerged. Sinner had never won a match that went past four hours (0-5). At the other end, Alcaraz had never won after losing the first two sets (0-8). One of the two were primed to end that drought with blows from the back getting fiercer and touches at the net getting silkier.You could not put this past Alcaraz who has had bad starts in major finals before only to win the tournament anyway. He trailed Novak Djokovic in the 2023 Wimbledon final and Alexander Zverev here last year.And that streak continued in Paris on Sunday as the 22-year-old banked on the crowd and his typical never-say-die attitude to reel off four straight games in the third set to relegate Sinner to his first set dropped in the tournament.Then, again, standing a point away from defeat, Alcaraz polished off five straight points to hold serve at 3-5 in the fourth set. He then broke Sinner's serve with the Italian attempting to clinch his third straight major title.The crowd vehemently supported Alcaraz as he bagged the tiebreak in the fourth set and forced a decisive fifth set. The Spaniard's racket, masquerading as a magic wand, started to produce astounding drop shots from deep with cross-court forehands landing in with plenty of zip and accuracy.In a match of unending twists, it was Sinner's turn to add some drama to the mix with Alcaraz broken at 5-4 when serving for the title. The World No. 1 picked three games in a row to overturn a 3-5 deficit into a 6-5 lead.In the 10-point tiebreak that followed, Alcaraz showed the three C's that have been passed on from his grandfather - cabeza (head), corazon (heart) and cojones (balls). He didn't shy away from referring to all three in the aftermath.""To put it to words was just happened is really difficult honestly. Two sets down against the World No. 1, with the level that he was playing. I just put my heart into it and tried to keep it going. Never gave up. I was just fighting. Point after point. In the end it was all heart,"" he said on Eurosport.""I played with my grandfather's three Cs. My grandfather is proud. After the match I played, I think I can say that (cojones),"" he added.Two weeks ago, it was Nadal who was feted on Court Philippe-Chatrier. For his 14 titles here and a jaw-dropping 112-4 win-loss record. Alcaraz was one of the thousands in attendance then, beaming, all smiles as his idol was celebrated.In a full circle moment, a fortnight later it was another Spaniard who was celebrated and feted for a trophy run. It was Alcaraz who stood atop the podium with the Coupe des Mousquetaires in tow.His trophy count in Paris may only read two, dwarfed by Nadal's superhuman tally, but the signs of a legend are there. At 22 years, 1 month and 3 days, Alcaraz has won his fifth Grand Slam title - the EXACT same age as Nadal when he achieved the same feat.There have been only 12 matches in this Alcaraz vs Sinner rivalry with the Spaniard leading by 8-4 having polished off the last five matches. The duel between them is eerily similar to that of Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal's historic tussles.Federer, who had a positive head-to-head record against much of the tour during his prime, only struggled to fend off Nadal with their rivalry finishing off at 24-16 in favour of the Spaniard.Sinner can relate with that stat. Since 2024, his win-loss record stands at 91-8. Remove Alcaraz out of that equation and it gets refreshed to 91-3. The last time the 23-year-old had a win over Alcaraz was back in September 2023.Even if the rivalry looks skewed on paper, on court, where it all matters, the margins, like on Sunday, is just a point. And we're here for it - and Carlos agrees.""This is the first match in a Grand Slam final. Hopefully not the last time,"" said Alcaraz.""Because I mean, as I said many times, every time that we face against each other, we raise our level to the top.""","Carlos Alcaraz has successfully defended his French Open crown with the win over Jannik Sinner in the final. The Spaniard came from two sets down to win 4-6 6-7, 6-4, 7-6,7-6 to stage a comeback for the history books. He also became just the third man in the Open Era - after Gaston Gaudio and Novak Djokovic - to save a championship point enroute to a Grand Slam title.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121716126,imgsize-155532,width-400,resizemode-4/121716126.jpg"

The win meant that Portugal became the first team in the history of the Nations League to win the competition twice.Ronaldo's involvement in the game was not limited to that, as he scored the all-important equalizer to pull his team back into the game, halfway through the second half.Ronaldo's goal came in the 61st minute, when a deflected cross from goal scorer Nuno Mendes fell invitingly in front of the forward who had placed himself at the far post. Beating his marker with ease, the No 7's volley found its way into the back of the net.Ronaldo was then taken off in the 88th minute owing to an injury and was replaced by PSG forward Goncalo Ramos. Ronaldo's teary-eyed reaction to winning the final has gone viral on social media, with fans pouring in messages of support and congratulations for the five-time Ballon d'Or winner.Up next, the Portuguese talisman will look to earn his side qualification for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.",Portugal beat Spain 1-0 on penalties to win the UEFA Nations League.

Cricket’s unpredictable nature was on full display during a Big Cricket League (BCL) match in Surat, Gujarat, as a rare and bizarre moment involving batter Chirag Gandhi went viral on social media. The incident, which occurred on December 15 last year during a match between UP Brij Stars and MP Tigers, left players, umpires and fans in disbelief - and laughter.The dramatic moment came when Gandhi, batting on 98, dragged a delivery from spinner Pawan Negi onto his stumps. The off-stump visibly shifted and leaned toward the middle stump, prompting the fielding side to erupt in celebration. But what happened next stunned everyone: the bail remained perfectly balanced on the stump, defying the laws of physics - and cricket.Even the on-field umpires were caught chuckling at the surreal scene as Gandhi calmly pointed to the bail still in place. The moment has since gone viral, with one fan aptly captioning it, “I’ve never seen better luck than this in cricket.”Despite this stroke of fortune, Gandhi’s team could not chase down MP Tigers’ mammoth 239-run total.UP Brij Stars finished at 168/5 in their 20 overs, with Gandhi staying unbeaten on 101 off 58 balls - a valiant knock that featured 12 fours and four sixes. His partnership of 112 runs with Aryan Kumar (42) was the only bright spot in an otherwise one-sided contest.The Yusuf Pathan-led MP Tigers dominated the game, thanks to Saket Sharma’s 101 off 52 balls and a blazing unbeaten 87 from Pawan Negi, the bowler who was denied Gandhi’s wicket in comical fashion.As the video continues to spread across cricket circles, it stands as yet another reminder: in cricket, the game truly isn’t over until the last bail falls.","Chirag Gandhi was dismissed by Pawan Negi during a Big Cricket League match in Surat, Gujarat.

Poll Which quality do you think is more important for a successful cricketer? Temperament and match awareness Power hitting and potential

Bombay Sport Exchange Ep. 6: Harish Thawani on cricket's TV market and the watershed moments





NEW DELHI: Batting legend Sunil Gavaskar has voiced strong criticism of the Indian Premier League ’s (IPL) growing tendency to prioritise raw, untested talent over consistent domestic performers.In his column for Mid-Day, Gavaskar argued that franchises must shift their scouting focus from state-level T20 leagues and U-19 tournaments to more competitive platforms like the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy.“This year’s IPL proved once again that relying on the performances of the state T20 leagues is not the way to go into the auction,” Gavaskar wrote. “It’s far better to go by the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy deeds as these games are a lot more competitive.”The former India captain also highlighted a worrying trend among younger players, suggesting that early fame and financial rewards might be affecting their motivation. “Many of the youngsters not used to so much money lose the motivation and are quite content just to be around rather than perform,” he said.Gavaskar emphasised the importance of temperament and match awareness over flashy, short-term impact. “What is needed is to see when the batting and bowling performances came,” he noted. “The runs and the wickets have to come when it matters.”He also questioned the obsession with strike rates, saying: “Some will justify scoring 15 in five deliveries as it’s a strike rate of 300, but maybe it was important that they batted another 15 deliveries and got 40 to take the team to a win.”Slamming many so-called “six hitters” who dazzled in smaller leagues but flopped on the big stage, Gavaskar concluded that “temperament and timing” must be valued as much as power and potential.","Sunil Gavaskar criticises Indian Premier League's tendency to prioritise raw, untested talent over consistent domestic performers.
