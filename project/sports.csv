‘Slavery Destroys Heritage’: PM Modi’s Big Message After Unveiling Sacred Buddha Piprahwa Relics

(Narendra Modi is the Prime Minister of India and is also the chairman of the Shree Somnath Trust)

Somnath… hearing this word instils a sense of pride in our hearts and minds. It is the eternal proclamation of India’s soul. This majestic temple is situated on the western coast of India in Gujarat, at a place called Prabhas Patan. The Dwadasha Jyotirling Stotram mentions the 12 Jyotirlings across India.The stotram begins with “Saurashtre Somnatham Ch”, symbolising the civilisational and spiritual importance of Somnath as the first Jyotirling.It is also said: Somalingam Naro Drishtva Sarvapapaih PramuchyateLabhte Phalam Manovaanchitam Mritah Svargam SamaashrayetIt means: Just the sight of Somnath Shivling ensures that a person is freed of sins, achieves their righteous desires and attains heaven after death.Tragically, this very Somnath, which drew the reverence and prayers of millions, was attacked by foreign invaders, whose agenda was demolition, not devotion.The year 2026 is significant for the Somnath Temple . It has been 1,000 years since the first attack on this great shrine. It was in Jan of 1026 that Mahmud of Ghazni attacked this temple, seeking to destroy a great symbol of faith and civilisation, through a violent and barbaric invasion.Yet, one thousand years later, the temple stands as glorious as ever because of numerous efforts to restore Somnath to its grandeur. One such milestone completes 75 years in 2026. It was during a ceremony on May 11th, 1951, in the presence of the then President of India, Dr Rajendra Prasad , that the restored temple opened its doors to devotees.The first invasion of Somnath a thousand years ago in 1026, the cruelty that was unleashed upon the people of the town and the devastation that was inflicted upon the shrine have been documented in great detail in various historical accounts.When you read them, the heart trembles. Each line carries the weight of grief, cruelty and a sorrow that refuses to fade with time.Imagine the impact it had on Bharat and the morale of the people. After all, Somnath had great spiritual significance. It was also on the coast, giving strength to a society with great economic prowess, whose sea traders and seafarers carried tales of its grandeur far and wide.Yet, I am proud to state unequivocally that the story of Somnath, a thousand years after the first attack, is not defined by destruction. It is defined by the unbreakable courage of crores of children of Bharat Mata.The medieval barbarism that began a thousand years ago in 1026 went on to ‘inspire’ others to repeatedly attack Somnath. It was the start of an attempt to enslave our people and culture. But, each time the temple was attacked, we also had great men and women who stood up to defend it and even made the ultimate sacrifice. And every single time, generation after generation, the people of our great civilisation picked themselves up, rebuilt and rejuvenated the temple. It is our privilege to have been nurtured by the same soil that has nurtured greats like Ahilyabai Holkar, who made a noble attempt to ensure devotees can pray at Somnath.In the 1890s, Swami Vivekananda visited Somnath and that experience moved him. He expressed his feelings during a lecture in Chennai in 1897 when he said, “Some of these old temples of southern India and those like Somnath of Gujarat will teach you volumes of wisdom, will give you a keener insight into the history of the race than any amount of books. Mark how these temples bear the marks of a hundred attacks and a hundred regenerations, continually destroyed and continually springing up out of the ruins, rejuvenated and strong as ever! That is the nationalmind, that is the national lifecurrent. Follow it and it leads to glory. Give it up and you die; death will be the only result, annihilation, the only effect, the moment you step beyond that life current.”The sacred duty of rebuilding the Somnath Temple after Independence came to the able hands of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. A visit during Diwali time in 1947 moved him so much that he announced that the temple will be rebuilt there. Finally, on May 11th, 1951, a grand temple in Somnath opened its doors to devotees and Dr Rajendra Prasad was present there. The great Sardar Sahib was not alive to see this historic day, but the fulfilment of his dream stood tall before the nation.The then Prime Minister, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, was not too enthused with this development. He did not want the honourable President as well as ministers to associate with this special event. He said that this event created a bad impression of India. But Dr Rajendra Prasad stood firm and the rest is history. No mention of Somnath is complete without recalling the efforts of KM Munshi, who supported Sardar Patel very effectively. His works on Somnath, including the book, ‘Somanatha: The Shrine Eternal’, are extremely informative and educative.Indeed, as the title of Munshi Ji’s book conveys, we are a civilisation that carries a sense of conviction about the eternity of spirit and of ideas. We firmly believe that that which is eternal is indestructible, as outlined in the famous Gita verse “ Nainam Chhindanti Shastraani ...”. There can be no better example of our civilisation’s indomitable spirit than Somnath, which stands gloriously, overcoming odds and struggles.It is this same spirit that is visible in our nation, one of the brightest spots of global growth, having overcome centuries of invasions and colonial loot. It is our value systems and the determination of our people that have made India the centre of global attention today. The world is seeing India with hope and optimism.They want to invest in our innovative youngsters. Ourart, culture, music and several festivals are going global. Yoga and Ayurveda are making a worldwide impact, boosting healthy living. Solutions to some of the most pressing global challenges are coming from India.Since time immemorial, Somnath has brought together people from different walks of life. Centuries ago, Kalikal Sarvagna Hemchandracharya, a respected Jain monk, came to Somnath. It is said that after praying there, he recited a verse, “ Bhavabijaankurjananaaraagaadyaah Kshayamupagataa Yasya” . It means: Salutations to That One in whom the seeds of worldly becoming are destroyed, in whom passion and all afflictions have withered away. Today, Somnath holds the same ability to awaken something profound within the mind and soul.A thousand years after the first attack in 1026, the sea at Somnath still roars with the same intensity as it did back then. The waves that wash the shores of Somnath tell a story. No matter what, just like the waves, it kept rising again and again. The aggressors of the past are now dust in the wind, their names synonymous with destruction. They are footnotes in the annals of history, while Somnath stands bright, radiating far beyond the horizon, reminding us of the eternal spirit that remained undiminished by the attack of 1026. Somnath is a song of hope that tells us that while hate and fanaticism may have the power to destroy for a moment, faith and conviction in the power of goodness have the power to create for eternity.If the Somnath Temple, which was attacked a thousand years ago and faced continuous attacks thereon, could rise again and again, then we can surely restore our great nation to the glory it embodied a thousand years ago before the invasions. With the blessings of Shree Somnath Mahadev, we move forward with a renewed resolve to build a Viksit Bharat, where civilisational wisdom guides us to work for the welfare of the whole world.Jai Somnath!","The year 2026 is significant for the Somnath Temple.

Denise DeBartolo York’s family net worth hit $8.4B on the 2025 Forbes 400

The San Francisco 49ers and Leeds United explain the York family’s money trail





Denise DeBartolo York and her family landed at No. 163 on the 2025 Forbes 400, with Forbes estimating their net worth at $8.4 billion. That figure comes from Forbes’ latest ranking, as reported Sept. 19, 2025.This is not some mystery-money story. Forbes ties the York family fortune primarily to their ownership of the San Francisco 49ers, where the family holds more than 90% of the franchise.The Forbes 400 list is basically a “you’re in or you’re out” snapshot of America’s richest. In 2025, Forbes said the 400 wealthiest Americans held $6.6 trillion combined, and you needed at least $3.8 billion to make the cut.The York family cleared that bar easily. WFMJ’s report notes the family’s wealth has climbed hard over the last decade, tracking Forbes wealth history data: $1.9 billion in 2016, $3.2 billion by 2020, and then the 2025 Forbes 400 estimate at $8.4 billion.They also landed ahead of other famous names on that same 2025 list, including Mark Cuban and Steven Spielberg, per the same report.Here’s the straight line: Edward DeBartolo Sr. bought the San Francisco 49ers for $13 million in 1977, and the family still controls the franchise today.Denise DeBartolo York took control of the 49ers in 2000. Her oldest son, Jed York, is now the team’s CEO. Forbes also lists the 49ers as the NFL’s sixth-most valuable franchise, and the team finished as the Super Bowl runner-up in 2023.Then the family pushed further into global soccer. The 49ers’ ownership arm agreed to buy the remaining 56% stake in Leeds United in 2023 after already owning 44%.The WFMJ report said the family paid more than $200 million to acquire that remaining stake.Bottom line: the Yorks aren’t climbing because of a random side hustle. Their net worth rises when their sports assets rise. And the biggest one is still the 49ers.Denise DeBartolo York and her family landed at No. 163 on the latest Forbes 400, with an estimated net worth of $8.4 billion, driven largely by their majority ownership of the San Francisco 49ers, which Forbes ranks as the National Football League’s sixth most valuable franchise. York, who took control of the team in 2000, now sees her son Jed York serving as CEO, while the family has also expanded into global soccer with their takeover of Leeds United in 2023.Their ranking places them ahead of billionaires like Mark Cuban, Stephen Spielberg, and Donald Trump, underscoring how central sports ownership has been to the York family’s growing financial power.","Denise DeBartolo York and her family landed at No. 163 on the 2025 Forbes 400, with Forbes estimating their net worth at $8.4 billion.

What’s actually confirmed about Taylor Swift’s attendance

last opportunity to play in a regular-season finale

might be a farewell moment





Whenever the Kansas City Chiefs take the field, one question somehow always pops up online before kickoff: Is Taylor Swift going to be there? With the Chiefs set to face the Raiders, fans are once again refreshing timelines, tracking private jets, and overanalyzing every rumor tied to Travis Kelce ’s biggest supporter. The matchup could mark the final NFL game of Travis Kelce’s 2025 season and possibly the end of his legendary career if he chooses to retire, making Swift’s potential attendance a bigger storyline than usual. So, what is confirmed and what’s just buzz? Here’s the latest.Here’s the important part: there is no official confirmation that Taylor Swift will be at the Chiefs-Raiders game. No statement has been made by her team, the Chiefs, or anyone directly connected to the situation. As of now, there have also been no verified sightings or confirmed reports from credible outlets saying she’s attending.Swift’s name has become a fixture in Chiefs coverage especially at Patriots and Chargers games where she’s appeared in the past and every time Travis Kelce takes the field, alternate timelines of fan speculation start trending. Now, because this Week 18 game may represent Kelce’s, fans online are especially keen to see Swift in the stands. The emotional backdrop is feeding more online theories and increased search traffic as kickoff approaches.The idea isn’t rooted in a confirmed schedule, it’s rooted in pattern recognition (Swift supports Kelce when she can) plus heightened stakes (a possible final game of his career). Rumors and fan theories are spreading on social platforms, with supporters imagining what it would mean for Swift to attend whatin his NFL journey.Even without the Taylor Swift factor, Chiefs vs. Raiders always draws attention. The rivalry brings extra intensity, and every late-season matchup carries weight for the Chiefs and their postseason momentum. Travis Kelce remains a focal point on offense, and his performances naturally keep him and his personal life in the spotlight.Whether or not Kelce retires this offseason, the emotional undertone around this game is palpable. It frames not just his potential final performance but why fans are curious about every detail including the possible presence of Swift.Also read - Hailee Steinfeld shares new pregnancy photos, shows baby bump and ‘Baby Beau’ onesie",The Kansas City Chiefs take on the Oakland Raiders in a regular-season finale.

Cardi B shares a cryptic message seemingly aiming at her boyfriend, Stefon Diggs

Stefon Diggs has refused to discuss his former private chef’s allegations in public





Stefon Diggs’ high profile romance with Cardi B seems to have hit a pause ever since the New England Patriots’ star player was accused of being physically violent towards his former private chef.While his former private chef has also dragged Cardi B into the mess, it seems the Grammy winner has a different set of strong feelings towards Stefon Diggs now.A few hours ago, the “Am I the Drama?” artist, Cardi B, took to her Instagram channel to share a cryptic message that read as, “Prayer without movement is noise”.This message of hers comes in shortly after reports of Stefon Diggs religiously praying before and after every game had sparked chaos.Many fans feel Cardi B might be hinting at how her relationship with Stefon Diggs has changed after he was accused of being physically violent towards his former private chef.However, neither Stefon Diggs nor Cardi B has responded to the speculations yet as the Grammy winner remains distant from the legal trouble.While Stefon Diggs has been accused of strangling and being physically violent towards a private chef on 2nd December, he has strongly denied the accusations.Stefon Diggs’ lawyer, David Meier, issued a statement to E! News, which read as, ""Stefon Diggs categorically denies these allegations. They are unsubstantiated, uncorroborated, and were never investigated—because they did not occur.”The statement added, “The timing and motivation for making the allegations is crystal clear they are the direct result of an employee-employer financial dispute that was not resolved to the employee's satisfaction. Stefon looks forward to establishing the truth in a court of law.""Interestingly, Stefon Diggs’ team, the New England Patriots, have also stood by him and has allowed him to participate in the playoffs.This has sparked outrage among fans as many feel that Stefon Diggs is going “unpunished”.At this point in time, Stefon Diggs has refused to discuss the matter in public as he reassures fans to be focusing on being there for his team, the New England Patriots.Also Read: Who is Aileen Lopera?

NEW DELHI: Bangladesh pacer Mustafizur Rahman has reacted to his release from the Indian Premier League (IPL) by the IPL franchise Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR).His reaction came before the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) on Sunday resolved that the national team will not travel to India for the upcoming T20 World Cup. The decision was taken at a meeting held on Sunday afternoon.The matter was discussed against the backdrop of Mustafizur Rahman’s exclusion from the IPL. BCB directors had earlier met online on Saturday night to discuss the issue.At that stage, most directors were not in favour of taking any strict step. However, following intervention from the Bangladesh government, the board reviewed its position and changed its decision.""The Board reviewed the situation in detail, taking into account developments over the last 24 hours and expressed deep concern over the overall circumstances surrounding the participation of the Bangladesh National Team in matches scheduled to be played in India,"" the BCB said in an official release.""Following a thorough assessment of the prevailing situation and the growing concerns regarding the safety and security of the Bangladesh contingent in India and considering the advice from the Bangladesh Government, the Board of Directors resolved that the Bangladesh National Team will not travel to India for the tournament under the current conditions,"" the statement added.The BCB has also requested that Bangladesh’s T20 World Cup matches be moved out of India.

Brief Scores

Desert Vipers:

MI Emirates:





Third time's a charm. Third time lucky. These are two popular sayings in the English language. It's as if the first two attempts were stumbling blocks, they were launchpads for something that was inevitable. For Desert Vipers, that was the ILT20 title on Sunday at the Dubai Cricket Stadium. Desert Vipers defeated MI Emirates (MIE) by 46 runs in a one-sided final in Dubai.They had been here, under the Ring of Fire, twice and tasted defeated both times.This time, it felt different. Desert Vipers were cut above the rest all season. The Vipers scarcely put a foot wrong, losing just two of their ten matches. Vipers asserted their dominance over MI Emirates twice in in the knockouts, cruising to a 45-run win in Qualifier 1 before outclassing them yet again in the final.When they met MIE once again in the final, they were contesting against not just a team that has triumphed in every T20 league across the world, they were facing a side that was led by a perennial champion in the form of Kieron Pollard The early signs were that things would go away from the Vipers' grasp again.Toss came out in favour of MI Emirates and they chose to field on a surface that has seen the team batting second triumph more often than the first.Andries Gous, the wicketkeeper-batter, who had scored an unbeaten 120 against MIE in the Qualifier, was out with a calf injury.Teams had on an average scored 154.66 runs when batting first at this venue this season. Dubai Capitals had produced the biggest total - 186 against the Abu Dhabi Knight Riders - and gone on to win by 83 runs.Clearly, score big and put things beyond MIE would have been the mantra for the Sam Curran-led Desert Vipers.Three boundaries in four balls in the third over showed that intent from Fakhar Zaman and Jason Roy in the third over. But a few balls later, both perished in the gap of four balls, falling to Fazalhaq Farooqi, and it brought out England's Sam Curran to the middle.Curran, who had seen the team fall short last season, had picked up the leadership duties from Lockie Ferguson. Pollard spoke about Curran's leadership in the chat before the final.“I was reading somewhere about Sam’s leadership, and that he is unbeaten as captain,” Pollard said. “Everything is leaning in his favour, which is a good thing – not just for Sam, but for future reference.”Individually, Curran had been a top performer for his side. Having scored 323 runs from 11 matches, he needed to deliver in this pressure moment, with two wickets falling in quick succession.He took his time to get going. In the first five balls, he failed to get off the mark. And once he did, he blazed four consecutive boundaries. And then there was another lull. He went 13 balls without hitting a boundary, including six dot balls. Then came another four. In the next spell of 21 balls, he hit further three boundaries. Evidently, the objective was to bide time on the low-scoring track.Romario Shepherd's errant deliveries - one full and wide, the other short on middle and off - allowed Curran to relax his arms and tonk two maximums.By the end of it all, Curran remained unbeaten on 74 from 51 balls - it wasn't a gun blazing knock by any stretch of the imagination but it had done the job for the team. From reeling at 36 for 2 in the fourth over, they had reached 182m for 4, helped in part by MIE bowling 11 wides or nearly two more overs.When he got the ball, Curran was smashed for 24 runs from two overs but his teammates had done the job for him. David Payne took 3 for 42, Naseem Shah picked 3 for 18 and Usman Tariq's tricky bowling action and variety fetched him 2 for 20.Maybe this third time lucky, third time's the charm was meant to be. MIE were chasing on the night for a sixth match in a row and had won four times. Both of the two defeats during this run came against Vipers.Curran, deservedly, will take in the applause. As the last wicket fell, he raised his hands, clapped multiple times before embracing his team as the Player of the Match, winner of the Green Belt and Red Belt for second year running.182 for 4 in 20 overs (Sam Curran 74 not out, Jason Holder 41; Fazallaq Farooqi 2/33)136 all out in 18.3 overs (Shakib Al Hasan 36; Naseem Shah 3/18, David Payne 3/42)","Desert Vipers defeated MI Emirates (MIE) by 46 runs in a one-sided final in Dubai.

Mohammed Kaif breaks silence on Mustafizur Rahman–KKR debate





NEW DELHI: Bangladesh's Mustafizur Rahman has found himself in the spotlight again. On Saturday, the left-arm pacer was released by the Indian Premier League ( IPL ) franchise Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), following a directive from the BCCI.The decision triggered a strong reaction back home, with the Bangladesh Cricket Board on Sunday announcing that the national team would not travel to India for the upcoming T20 World Cup due to security concerns.While the episode has added a political layer to the story, Mustafizur’s IPL journey extends far beyond the current controversy.Before his brief association with KKR, five IPL franchises had shown faith in the Bangladeshi pacer over the years.Mustafizur made his IPL debut in 2016 with Sunrisers Hyderabad. It turned out to be a breakthrough season.He picked up 17 wickets in 16 matches, conceding runs at an impressive economy of 6.90. His cutters and change of pace made him a key weapon, especially at the death.He returned to SRH in 2017 but featured in just one match due to fitness issues, team balance, and national team commitments.In 2018, Mumbai Indians brought him in, where he played seven games and took seven wickets.Rajasthan Royals signed him in 2021, and Mustafizur delivered another steady season.He claimed 14 wickets in 14 matches, proving his value as a reliable overseas bowler.Delhi Capitals then picked him for multiple seasons.Between 2022 and 2025, he played for DC in three different editions, having taken 13 wickets across 13 matches.His best season with Delhi came in 2025, where he picked up four wickets in just three matches at an economy of 7.90.In 2024, Chennai Super Kings trusted him with a bigger role. Mustafizur responded by taking 14 wickets in nine matches, including a four-wicket haul.Mustafizur has played 60 IPL matches across five teams, taking 65 wickets at an average of 28.44 and a strike rate of 20.9. His best figures remain 4 for 29.KKR had bought him for Rs 9.20 crore after a bidding war at the Abu Dhabi auction. However, following the BCCI’s diktat, the Shah Rukh Khan co-owned franchise released him.While the BCCI did not directly link the move to political tensions, it stated that the decision was driven by “what’s been happening all around”.","Bangladesh's Mustafizur Rahman released by IPL franchise Kolkata Knight Riders.

India ODI squad review | Iyer returns, Pant gets the nod, Shami misses out again

Poll Should more awareness be raised about meningitis and its risks? Yes, definitely Maybe No, it's well-known





Former Australian cricketer Damien Martyn has emerged from an induced coma following a serious bout of meningitis, with former teammate and close friend Adam Gilchrist describing the turnaround as nothing short of “a miracle”.The 54-year-old former batter, who played 67 Tests and 208 one-day internationals for Australia, fell critically ill late last month and was rushed to hospital on the Gold Coast, where he was diagnosed with meningitis — a potentially life-threatening inflammation of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord.Gilchrist confirmed on Sunday that Martyn has now woken from the coma and is responding strongly to treatment.“It’s been an unbelievable turn of events in the last 48 hours,” Gilchrist said. “He is now able to talk and respond to treatment. He has responded extraordinarily well since coming out of the coma to the point where his family feels it’s like some sort of miracle.”According to Gilchrist, Martyn’s condition has improved so rapidly that doctors are hopeful he can soon be moved out of the intensive care unit at Gold Coast University Hospital.“It has been so positive that they’re hopeful he will be able to move out of the ICU into another part of the hospital, which is representative of what a great recovery it’s been and how quickly it has flipped around,” he said. “He’s in good spirits and overwhelmed by the support. There is still some treatment and monitoring to go, but it’s looking positive.”Gilchrist also shared a message from Martyn’s wife Amanda, crediting the outpouring of support from across the cricketing world for aiding his recovery. “She really wants to say to everyone that she is convinced the love, goodwill and sense of care — through messages and media coverage — really helped him,” he said.Born in Darwin, Martyn made his Test debut at 21 during the 1992–93 series against the West Indies. Renowned as one of the game’s finest strokemakers, he became a key figure in Steve Waugh ’s dominant Australian side, scoring 13 Test centuries at an average of 46.37.He was part of Australia’s World Cup-winning teams in 1999 and 2003. Martyn retired during the 2006–07 Ashes series and has largely stayed out of the public eye since.","Former Australian cricketer Damien Martyn has emerged from an induced coma following a serious bout of meningitis.

Usman Khawaja's retirement speech: 'I want the journey for the next Usman Khawaja to be easier'





A frustrated Cricket Australia chief Todd Greenberg on Monday vowed to raise concerns over what he described as “archaic” bad light rules with the sport’s governing body after nearly a third of the opening day at the fifth Ashes Test was washed out. Play was halted 15 minutes before the scheduled tea break on Sunday at the Sydney Cricket Ground, with almost 50,000 fans in attendance, due to fading light, light rain and lightning protocols.No further action was possible, with stumps called an hour earlier than scheduled at 5:00 pm and the entire third session abandoned.“There's a lot of things that I get frustrated with in cricket but bad light's one of them,” Greenberg told SEN radio.“Yesterday, maybe more so than ever with a full house and millions watching on TV.“We've got to find a better way in cricket ... where we try not to come off the field when it's bad light and show a greater willingness and intent to get back on.”Under ICC regulations, play cannot resume if on-field umpires agree that light conditions are deemed “dangerous or unreasonable”. The rules also stipulate that play cannot restart until at least 30 minutes after lightning strikes in the area, a provision that left fans puzzled as action remained suspended despite improving conditions.Greenberg admitted he did not have an immediate solution but said advancements such as light towers and modern technology suggested there had to be a better approach.“What you can take from my comments is a desire to push at the global level of how we get better at these things because it felt like it wasn't good enough,” he said.“I have talked about this a bit over the years, the nuance of cricket and some of the strange and archaic rules that sit within the sport.“I'm sure there's conversations that can be had about how we can be slightly more progressive.“I sound like a broken record, but we're in the entertainment business, and so I can't think of another business that continues to walk off in front of its fans.”Former England captain Michael Vaughan also called for a change in “mindset” from match officials and administrators.“In T20 cricket you play in this. Test cricket is the one format that we do everything we possibly can to get off the pitch,” Vaughan told the BBC.“The other two formats we do everything we possibly can to get on the pitch. I just don't understand why we don't have that same mindset in Test match cricket.”","Cricket Australia chief Todd Greenberg vows to raise concerns over 'archaic' bad light rules with the sport's governing body.

Mohammed Kaif breaks silence on Mustafizur Rahman–KKR debate





DHAKA/NEW DELHI: Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) on Sunday decided that its cricket team will not travel to India for the upcoming T20 World Cup, co-hosted by Sri Lanka.In a retaliation following star Bangladesh bowler Mustafizur Rahman ’s exclusion on Saturday from the upcoming IPL, where he is contracted with Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), the BCB, following an emergency meeting Sunday afternoon, decided to formally request the ICC seeking an alternative venue outside India. It cited security concerns “under the current circumstances”, and said it is considering the advice from Bangladesh interim govt.Bangladesh were scheduled to play all four league matches of the World Cup in Mumbai and Kolkata.""The board reviewed the situation in detail, taking into account developments over the last 24 hours and expressed deep concern over the overall circumstances surrounding the participation of the Bangladesh national team in matches scheduled to be played in India,” a BCB statement said.“In light of this decision, BCB has formally requested the International Cricket Council (ICC), as the event authority, to consider relocating all of Bangladesh’s matches to a venue outside India,”, the BCB said, “The Bangladesh Cricket Board looks forward to the ICC’s understanding of the situation and an urgent response on this matter.”The decision was made “to safeguard the safety and wellbeing of Bangladeshi players, team officials, board members and other stakeholders,” the statement further added.The BCB had back-to-back meetings from Saturday night to Sunday afternoon. While their statement Sunday did not mention Rahman’s ouster from the IPL, sources said BCB posed three major concerns before the ICC: Rahman’s ouster from IPL, the current security situation in India and why decisions were taken against Bangladeshi players (in the IPL) citing security reasons.Due to the persisting diplomatic tension between India and Pakistan, ICC has already allocated all of Pakistan’s matches in Sri Lanka for the Feb 7-Mar 8 World Cup.Rahman’s removal Saturday, after the BCCI instructed KKR to release the pacer, sparked outrage in Bangladesh, with many, including sports and law adviser Asif Nazrul leading calls for the BCB not to travel to India, and to request a relocation of its matches to Sri Lanka.“I strongly condemn and protest this. As the adviser in charge of the sports ministry, I have asked the cricket control board to explain the entire matter to ICC and write to it,” Nazrul said on Saturday night.“We welcome this decision taken in the context of the radical communal policies of the Indian cricket board,” Nazrul said on Sunday.Many in Bangladesh feel that calls to drop the IPL from local television altogether could now inevitably grow.Information and broadcasting adviser Syeda Rizwana Hasan on Sunday said any decision over halting broadcast of IPL in Bangladesh would be taken after reviewing the legal basis and thoroughly examining relevant procedures.TOI has learnt that BCCI has also got into a huddle and is discussing the matter with ICC. With the T20 World Cup just about a month away, it will be a logistical nightmare to relocate the matches following Bangladesh’s decision not to travel to India.Before assuming office as ICC chairman in Dec 2024, Jay Shah, as BCCI secretary, had, in an arrangement with Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), decided that India and Pakistan teams will not tour each other. Pakistan’s cricketers last played in India during the ODI World in 2023. It will be interesting to see if Shah heeds to Bangladesh’s demands without carrying out a recce of the venues in India.It must be noted that the BCCI had not specified any reason for instructing Kolkata Knight Riders to expel Rahman. BCCI secretary Devajit Saikia had merely mentioned the move was “due to recent developments”.BCCI is still not committed to touring Bangladesh without govt approval, having already cancelled a white-ball tour last year. BCB had planned a white-ball series with India later this year in Sept. However, if BCB doesn’t relent on their demand for relocation of matches to Sri Lanka, the BCCI will lose another ICC full member nation to play bilateral cricket with.This could force ICC to rejig its future tours programme (FTP) keeping the World Test Championship in mind. It will also lead to uncertainty over staging multi-nation tournaments in the subcontinent, including the Commonwealth Games scheduled to be hosted by India in 2030.Last year, the Indian govt had released a policy where it restricted sporting ties with Pakistan to only multi-nation events in lieu of their planned bid for the 2036 Olympics. In 2024, only a junior team from Pakistan had travelled to Chennai for the South Asian Athletics. No Pakistan team has travelled to India for any event across disciplines since. Whether this latest sporting impasse between India and Bangladesh will go the IndiaPak way, time will tell.","Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) on Sunday decided that its cricket team will not travel to India for the upcoming T20 World Cup, co-hosted by Sri Lanka.

Colts officially rule out Sauce Gardner due to lingering calf injury





The Indianapolis Colts will be without one of their defensive backs in the final week of the regular season. Cornerback Sauce Gardner has officially been ruled out after dealing with a calf injury, according to the team’s latest injury report. With Week 18 approaching fast, the decision shuts the door on any last-minute return and leaves Indianapolis short-handed in the secondary as they prepare for their final game.The Colts confirmed that Sauce Gardner will not play this week after failing to recover from a calf issue that has limited him recently. Gardner was unable to practice leading up to the game, which ultimately led to the team ruling him out entirely.The injury has clearly been enough of a concern for Indianapolis to take a cautious approach. Rather than risking further aggravation, the Colts opted to keep Gardner sidelined, signaling that he was never truly close to returning for Week 18.Gardner being ruled out creates another challenge for a Colts defense that has already dealt with inconsistency throughout the season. With one less cornerback available, Indianapolis will need to rely more heavily on depth players to handle coverage responsibilities.Against a Texans offense that can stretch the field, losing a defensive back only adds pressure to the rest of the unit. The Colts will have to adjust their rotations and coverage schemes without Gardner in the lineup, especially on the outside.Gardner’s calf injury surfaced over the past few weeks and continued to limit him as the season progressed. While the team did not provide a detailed timeline, his lack of participation in practice made his Week 18 availability unlikely from the start.With the regular season nearing its end, the Colts’ decision suggests a longer-term mindset rather than pushing through a late-season injury. There was no indication of a setback during the week simply that Gardner was not healthy enough to go.With Gardner officially ruled out for Week 18, attention now turns to his recovery moving forward. The Colts have not announced a timetable for his return, and his status will likely be reevaluated once the season concludes.Also read - Jerry Jones gives sarcastic response to Micah Parsons after he claimed his name was slandered","Colts officially rule out Sauce Gardner due to lingering calf injury.

“slandering my name to Cowboys media and national media for months.”

“I wish Micah the very best,”

“I’d love to have Micah on the team. But we just couldn’t afford him. We wanted four to five players more than we did him. But he’s outstanding. I understand his sensitivity and can even understand these comments.”





The Micah Parsons breakup with the Dallas Cowboys just got a lot more personal and a lot more public. What started as a contract dispute has now turned into a full-blown war of words, with Parsons accusing team owner Jerry Jones of slandering his name and Jones responding live on Dallas radio. Instead of quietly moving on, both sides are now fighting over the story of why this relationship fell apart. And Jerry’s explanation? It’s already setting fans on fire.Micah Parsons didn’t hold back when he took to social media and accused Jerry Jones ofThe post immediately went viral, with fans reading it as a clear sign that the split between Parsons and Dallas wasn’t just about money, it was about respect.For many supporters, the accusation hit hard. Parsons wasn’t a role player. He was the face of the Cowboys defense, a game-changing star who consistently delivered. Seeing him suggest that the organization was quietly damaging his reputation added an emotional layer to an already messy exit.Jerry Jones finally responded during an appearance on 105.3 The Fan, and his comments quickly made headlines.Jones said.On the surface, Jones sounded calm and respectful. He praised Parsons’ talent and claimed to understand his emotions. But the explanation that Dallas preferred roster depth over keeping Micah was exactly what reignited the controversy.This is where things got complicated. By saying the Cowboys wanted “four to five players more” than Parsons, Jones framed the decision as purely strategic. But to many fans and possibly Micah himself that wording felt like more than a cap discussion.It wasn’t just “we couldn’t make the numbers work.” It sounded like the team valued others more than their defensive superstar. That subtle difference is why so many believe Jones’ comments actually support Micah’s claim instead of clearing the air.At this point, the relationship looks beyond repair. Jerry Jones believes he explained the business side. Micah Parsons believes his reputation was dragged on the way out. And neither side seems interested in backing down.Also read - Viral NYE video shows Tom Brady and Alix Earle getting cozy together, sparks dating rumors and age-gap chatter","The Micah Parsons breakup with the Dallas Cowboys just got a lot more personal.

NEW DELHI: A 50-year-old property dealer died after allegedly jumping from the 20th floor of Le Meridien Hotel in New Delhi's Connaught Place on Sunday afternoon.No suicide note was found at the spot or on the Lajpat Nagar resident, police said, adding that he was reportedly under considerable mental stress and suffering from depression.While an initial probe suggests that the man might have taken his own life, the cops are exploring all possible angles behind his death.Alerted by staff of the five-star hotel about the incident at 12.40 pm, police found the man lying on the ground. The preliminary enquiry revealed that he had entered the hotel and proceeded to the 20th floor. While access is controlled to other floors, this is not the case for the 20th floor because it houses a restaurant.The man had stayed at the hotel on Dec 25 and 26 last year before checking out, police found out. While reviewing Sunday's CCTV footage, they saw him moving towards the 20th floor prior to the incident, a senior officer said. However, no one saw him jumping from the building. It was after a loud thud was heard that the hotel staff rushed out and found him lying on the ground. They took him to hospital where he was declared dead.A police team visited the man's house and met his wife, who claimed she was unaware of any specific reason behind his death. During interactions with other relatives, investigators learned that the man had been involved in property business for several years, but wasn't faring well in recent times. ""We also came to know he might have been undergoing medical treatment for depression, which is being verified,"" the officer said.Police are interacting with the hotel staff to ascertain the exact sequence of events leading to the incident. They are in touch with the man's family members to gather additional information and possible clues that may help establish the circumstances behind his death.TOI reached out to the hotel authorities for a response regarding the incident, but received no reply till late at night.","A 50-year-old property dealer died after allegedly jumping from the 20th floor of Le Meridien Hotel in New Delhi's Connaught Place.

Agustina Gorzelany once again showed on Sunday what she is capable of as she helped Shrachi Bengal Tigers beat Ranchi Royals in their Women's Hockey India League encounter at Marang Gomke Jaipal Singh Astro Turf Hockey Stadium in Ranchi on Sunday.The Argentine scored her fourth goal of the tournament, once again from a penalty corner, as Bengal Tigers earned a 1-0 win. It was their fourth PC of the match and Gorzelany powered the ball down the right side and into the net. Bichu Devi Kharibam, who made a brilliant save off the earlier shot, tried to get across to it but couldn't reach it.This was Bengal Tigers' second win in regular time and they are placed second on the table with eight points from four matches. As for the Royals, they are third with six points from the same number of games.Earlier, the Royals dominated the proceedings, winning five penalty corners and making seven circle penetrations in the first quarter, but they just couldn't get the goal. While the defenders did a good job, it was their goalkeeper Jennifer Rizzo who made the difference making some splendid saves during the PCs.However, after the break it was Bengal Tigers who took control of the game and started putting pressure on the Royals defence.And they should have taken the lead had it not been for Madhuri Kindo, who once again impressed with her goalkeeping skills.On two occasions she denied Lalremsiami from scoring. Once was when she got her hands to a shot from close range that would have easily gone into the top-right corner. The other time was when the two of them were in a one-on-one situation and Kindo came out of her blocks to force Lalremsiami to change her direction and miss the target.But Royals finally succumbed to the pressure of Bengal Tigers as Gorzelany scored seven minutes into the third quarter.In the final quarter, Royals went all out in search of the equaliser, but it just did not come. With little more than two minutes left, Albela Rani Toppo did sound the board once, but it wasn't allowed and the Royals also couldn't review it because too much time had gone by.In the end, Bengal Tigers held on for the win and avenged their 0-5 defeat to the Royals earlier in the tournament. As for Royals, they will look to bounce back when they face off against Soorma Hockey Club on Monday.",Bengal Tigers beat Ranchi Royals 1-0 in Women's Hockey India League. Agustina Gorzelany scored her fourth goal of the tournament from a penalty corner. Bengal Tigers are second on the table with eight points from four matches. Royals are third with six points from the same number of games.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126344767,imgsize-33184,width-400,resizemode-4/whil.jpg"

Jay Shah’s 2036 Olympic blueprint for India: '8 Medals won’t cut it'

Poll Should the Boxing Federation of India increase support for logistical arrangements? Yes, absolutely No, they are doing fine Maybe, depends on outcomes





NEW DELHI: The country’s top boxers were left cooling their heels for hours as chaos and confusion marked the opening day of the Elite Men and Women National Boxing Championships in Greater Noida on Sunday, with the start of competition delayed by more than four hours due to what officials described as “logistical” issues.The tournament, slated to be a landmark event with the men’s and women’s national championships being staged together for the first time, was scheduled to get underway at 2 pm at Gautam Buddha University. Instead, prolonged uncertainty and poor preparedness defined the day.Even basic infrastructure was missing. Three competition rings were meant to be operational on the opening day, but only one was assembled by around 4 pm. That too had to be dismantled and reassembled after a technical fault was detected. As a result, the first of the 80 scheduled bouts — 38 in the women’s section and 42 in the men’s — finally began only at 6.30 pm. Women boxers were left waiting even longer. As of 8 pm, there was still no clarity on when their bouts would begin, with the third ring yet to be assembled and no official communication forthcoming.Sources said that the organisers could not set up the rings and other equipment overnight as the gate of the venue, Gautam Budh University in Greater Noida, was locked.“There were some communication issues, and the organisers did not know that the University gates would be closed for the night. So, they had to wait till the next day to set up everything,” a source said. A source, familiar with the matter, also said that the delay “actually” stemmed from payment-related issues. “Work only began after payment was made to the vendor,” the source added.However, Boxing Federation of India (BFI) secretary general Pramod Kumar told PTI, “The delay was because of certain logistical issues.”The prolonged wait took a visible toll on athletes. Several boxers attempted to pass the time inside the arena — some plugged into headphones, others paced the hall — as the hours ticked by without announcements.The national championships are already delayed as it was to be held in late December last year.Top Indian pugilists, including world champion Jaismine Lamboria , Olympian Nikhat Zareen and several other World Boxing Cup medallists, are in the fray. The competition, which will conclude on Jan 10, will see the men’s and women’s events being held simultaneously at the same venue, with nearly 600 boxers from across the country set to participate in 10 weight categories each in both men and women sections.Other prominent boxers, in action in the women’s section, are reigning world champion Minakshi Hooda, Tokyo Olympics bronze medallist Lovlina Borgohain and Asian Games bronze medallist Preeti Pawar. Among men, World Boxing Cup Finals gold medallists Hitesh Gulia and Sachin Siwach, silver medallist Abhinash Jamwal and World Championships silver medallist Amit Panghal are fighting for top honours.","Chaos and confusion mark opening day of Elite Men and Women National Boxing Championships in Greater Noida.

Prof Shyamapada Patra memorial lecture: Remembering a respected teacher and guide,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/prof-shyamapada-patra-memorial-lecture-remembering-a-respected-teacher-and-guide/articleshow/126344448.cms,"Jadavpur University's electrical engineering department hosted a memorial lecture for Prof Shyamapada Patra







KOLKATA: On a cold winter afternoon, reminiscences of one man spread warmth around the seminar hall at the electrical engineering department of Jadavpur University. The occasion was the Prof Shyamapada Patra Memorial Lecture, organised by the Jadavpur Electrical Engineers’ Welfare Association (JEEWA) on Wednesday, to mark his centenary which falls on June 1, 2026.Speaker after speaker, mostly ex-students, recollected how interactions with ‘Patra Saheb’, as he was fondly called, and his teaching left a lasting impact on their lives. They spoke about Prof Patra’s compassion towards fellow teachers, staff and students, and how he was meticulous in his actions and always firm in his decisions. Some of his students later became professors in the same department.Nirmalendu Chatterjee, former professor and an ex-student, said, “While tutoring students after retirement, I could remember the lessons Prof Patra taught as they were still clear before my eyes. I didn’t have to brush up on those subjects again because he taught the concepts so well.”The memorial address was delivered by Bikash Pal, professor of power systems at Imperial College London (ICL). He got his BE degree from JU in 1990. Prof Patra taught him one semester in his 4th year and guided him in his final-year project. He described Prof Patra as a bright, kind and humble man, who gave him advice on his PhD from ICL and kept contact with him through letters.Prof Pal spoke on the topic, ‘Protection for low carbon power networks: Challenges and opportunities’. He reviewed the success of existing technologies in relaying and protection of electricity supply systems and their limitations in the current context of inverter-driven power networks. He also touched upon control measures to make power swing stability and protection functions.The welcome address was given by Manik Chandra Ghosh, president of JEEWA, while Prof Madhubanti Maitra, head of department (HoD), electrical engineering, also spoke.Prof Patra joined the then College of Engineering and Technology (CET), Jadavpur, as a lecturer of electrical engineering in 1949. In 1956, he went to the UK on a scholarship for an integrated MSc & PhD course in the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (UMIST). He returned in 1959 and was promoted as a reader at CET, which had by then become a part of JU. At the time he was the only doctorate teacher in the department. At a young age, he was tasked with setting up the syllabus of the newly introduced PG course in power systems and teaching the subject-oriented papers alongside then HoD, Prof H C Guha. Under his guidance, the power systems laboratory was developed. Due to funds crunch, costly equipment was built indigenously in the lab during the period from 1962-70. In 1982, Prof Patra took up the task of writing a textbook on ‘Power System Protection’, with the help of Prof S.K. Basu and Prof Samiran Choudhuri. It was published in 1983 with a price of Rs 53. The book was of great help to students so much so that Prof Pal remembered that the title was present in the library shelf of his PhD guide in ICL. The book is now out of print. Prof Patra superannuated in 1986 but continued teaching in JU till 1991. A few months after his retirement, he was diagnosed with colon cancer and he succumbed to the disease on Oct 31, 1992.","Jadavpur University's electrical engineering department hosted a memorial lecture for Prof Shyamapada Patra.

Peyton Manning's net worth in 2026



Peyton Manning's endorsement deals





Peyton Manning never relied only on arm strength to define his career. From the moment he entered the NFL in 1998, his sharp football mind and calm leadership style made him stand out. He did not just win games. He changed how the quarterback position was played and how stars could build value beyond the field.It's been years since HOF hung up his cleats, but his financial success still shows his football career. His smart contracts, endorsements, and long-term business planning helped him turn his eminence on Sundays into a longstanding enterprise that continues to grow in 2026.At present, Peyton Manning’s net worth is $300 million, per Celebrity Net Worth. His wealth comes from his NFL salary, endorsements, and investments.Manning played 18 NFL seasons from 1998 to 2015. He spent 14 years with the Indianapolis Colts and four with the Denver Broncos. Over that span, he earned roughly $115 million in NFL salary alone. His biggest deal came in March 2012, when he signed a five-year, $96 million contract with Denver after undergoing neck surgery that ended his Colts' run.At his peak, Manning made about $18 million per year in base salary. His career accolades added value to his brand. He won two Super Bowls in February 2007 and February 2016, earned five NFL MVP awards, and made 14 Pro Bowls. He retired in March 2016 after winning Super Bowl 50 and entered the Pro Football Hall of Fame in August 2021.Even after football, Manning stayed visible. His Omaha Productions company became a major player in the media industry. In August 2023, the company sold a minority stake at a reported valuation of $750 million, boosting Manning’s long-term wealth.Endorsements played an even bigger role in building Manning’s fortune. During his playing days, he earned approximately $40 million per year from brand endorsements. In retirement, that number remains nearly $25 million annually.Manning worked with Bud Light, Buick, Gatorade, DirecTV, Papa John’s, Mastercard, Reebok, Sony, and ESPN. His Papa John’s partnership went deeper. He owned 21 franchise locations in Colorado before selling his stake in 2018.His media presence also expanded. Since September 2021, Manning and his brother Eli have hosted the ManningCast on ESPN’s Monday Night Football. The show brought a new audience and strengthened Peyton’s post-playing career value.Peyton Manning built his wealth the same way he ran an offense. He planned ahead, read situations fast, and made smart decisions. Titles and trophies made him famous. Discipline and business sense made him rich. That is how success turned into lasting wealth.Also Read: Drake Maye and wife Ann Michael’s combined net worth in 2025: Why the $1 Million figure doesn’t tell the whole story","At present, Peyton Manning’s net worth is $300 million, per Celebrity Net Worth.

Cole Van Lanen net worth: How Jacksonville’s offensive line anchor turned consistency into a career-defining extension with the team,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/cole-van-lanen-net-worth-how-jacksonvilles-offensive-line-anchor-turned-consistency-into-a-career-defining-extension-with-the-team/articleshow/126322488.cms,"Cole Van Lanen (via Getty Images)

From late-round draft pick to one of the Jaguars’ most trusted linemen





The Jacksonville Jaguars’ rise to a 12-4 record was a steady buildup, and one player who has embodied and anchored the team’s performance and stability is offensive guard Cole Van Lanen. Van Lanen’s NFL journey began without much fanfare, and it began when he was selected by the Green Bay Packers in the sixth round of the 2021 NFL Draft.His rookie contract reflected that status, a four-year deal worth $3.6 million with limited guaranteed money. He appeared in just one season for Green Bay, earning roughly $248,000, before his career took a new direction. When the Jaguars brought him in during 2022, they assumed a modest portion of his rookie contract.In the 2025 season alone, he played 15 games, logging 576 offensive snaps and remaining active in special teams situations. That reliability became a valuable asset for a team pushing toward contention. With his contract set to expire, Jacksonville avoided the risk of free agency by agreeing to a three-year, $51 million extension.According to NFL insider Ian Rapoport, the deal includes $32.5 million in guaranteed compensation and incentives that could increase the total value to $55.5 million.Negotiated by CAA Football’s RJ Gonser and Jim Denton, it represents the largest contract of Van Lanen’s career.After five NFL seasons, his net worth stood at $3.23 million (according to Salary Sport) entering 2026. That figure is expected to increase by at least $10 million almost immediately once the extension takes effect. His average annual salary will now sit at $17 million, with early seasons likely carrying higher payouts.By the end of the deal, Van Lanen’s career earnings could reach $57.5 million, or close to $62 million if incentives are met. As of Week 18, the Jaguars are set to face off against the Tennessee Titans on Sunday, January 4, 2026.Also read: Who is Jacksonville Jaguars owner Shahid Khan?

Riley Gaines backs state laws and supports female athletes speaking out







Riley Gaines has once again stepped into the national spotlight. The former collegiate swimmer announced that she plans to attend two major Supreme Court hearings that could shape the future of women’s sports in the United States. The cases focus on whether states can legally restrict transgender athletes from competing in women’s categories.Gaines said the upcoming decisions are extremely important. She believes the rulings will determine whether laws designed to protect women’s sports are constitutional. The hearings involve laws from West Virginia and Idaho. Both cases have drawn national attention and sparked strong opinions on fairness, safety, and equal opportunity in sports.Riley Gaines confirmed she will be present at the Supreme Court in two weeks for the hearings of West Virginia v. B.P.J. and Little v. Hecox. She explained that these cases will decide if states are allowed to protect women’s sports under the Constitution. Gaines also encouraged her supporters to make their voices heard by signing a related petition.The West Virginia case centers on a state law that prevents transgender girls from competing in female sports categories.A middle school athlete named Becky challenged the law, arguing that it violates constitutional rights and Title IX protections. Becky has reportedly been on medication since the start of puberty. Gaines believes the case will have a major impact on youth and school sports nationwide.The second case, Little v. Hecox, involves Idaho’s HB 500 law. This law banned transgender athletes from women’s sports. Lindsay, a transgender college student at Boise State University, was affected by the rule and challenged it in court. The Supreme Court agreed to review both cases.In addition to her legal advocacy, Gaines recently voiced strong support for San Jose State University volleyball player Brooke Slusser. In a Fox News interview, Slusser shared the emotional stress she faced after learning a transgender athlete, Blaire Flemming, was competing on her team. Gaines accused the school of failing to inform female athletes about the situation.Gaines said Slusser only spoke up after realizing she had been living with and sharing hotel rooms with a biological male during team trips. She added that Slusser eventually left school and returned home due to concerns for her safety and mental health. Gaines described the situation as abusive.Slusser later revealed that the experience deeply affected her health. She said the stress led to an eating disorder and caused her to temporarily lose her menstrual cycle. Gaines continues to argue that these stories highlight why women’s voices must be central in discussions about sports policies.Also Read: Riley Gaines slams doctors over “non-standard” gender surgeries, demands strict action",Riley Gaines will attend two Supreme Court hearings that could shape the future of women's sports in the United States.

From MCG to T20 World Cup snub: How Indian cricket let Shubman Gill down

Poll Do you support Shubman Gill's suggestion for improved preparation? Strongly agree Agree Disagree





NEW DELHI: With India suffering an embarrassing 0-2 loss at home against South Africa, TOI learnt that Test captain Shubman Gill suggested to the Indian cricket board ( BCCI ) that there should be 15-day camps before every Test series.The BCCI held informal meetings with selectors and the leadership group of the team after it was whitewashed twice in home Test series in the space of 13 months. “Gill was very clear that the team needed better preparation before going into a Test series. There was an issue with the itinerary this season where the team didn’t have much time to prepare. Gill recommended to the Board that it would be ideal if there were 15-day red-ball camps before a Test series,” a BCCI source told TOI.India went into the last home Test season 4 days after winning the Asia Cup. India played West Indies in a Test match on October 2, with players arriving from Dubai on September 29. Gill and a lot of Test specialists reached India after a whiteball tour of Australia 4 days before the first Test against South Africa in Kolkata.TOI understands that the BCCI is willing to let Gill have a greater say in drawing up plans for the team.“Gill is showing assertive qualities now. He is presenting his vision to the selectors and BCCI with a lot more clarity. It augurs well for Indian cricket as there is a need for a strong captain after Rohit Sharma. The Test and ODI teams are Gill’s. It is important for him to have a bigger say,” the source told BCCI.However, India’s choc-abloc calendar may not make it easy to plan 15-day camps every time.The BCCI source said it may have to utilise its coaching staff and facilities at the centre of excellence (CoE) in Bengaluru. “There may be instances where Gambhir will be busy with white-ball teams even as there may be a Test series approaching. The Board may use the services of CoE cricket head VVS Laxman to organise red-ball camps,” the source said.",Shubman Gill suggested to the Indian cricket board ( BCCI ) that there should be 15-day camps before every Test series.

She passionately spoke of his unwavering dedication amidst adversity, battling both racism and physical hardships to forge a better future for his family.

Trump Immigration Offensive SHOCK Reveal; Workplace Raids, Expanded Detention Incoming Next Year

Social media reactions:

Your dad and your mam are heroes Narinder I know what you mean I worked in the shipyards on the Tyne , and I’m sure they would be proud of you , your also a hero fighting against racism , I for one salute you

Good for you Narinder that your Dad was so honest and hard working.

I've said a 100 times on here... The ""Immigrants"" living near me are all bloody hard working and conscientious.

Beautifully put, and on top of that supporting extended family members as well as looking after their own families. They were hard workers, hard graft, in a tumultuous time for the country.

You don't have to prove anything Narinder. It's bloody awful that you have to give people your background, it's ridiculous. People can be so weird and downright nasty with it.





British broadcaster and television personality Narinder Kaur has called for immigrants to be given fair chances as the UK enters 2026, sharing a personal story about her father’s life and hard work.In a post on X, Kaur wrote that she normally would not share a photo and the early life of her father as a poor immigrant, but this time made an exception only to speak out against growing anti-immigrant rhetoric. “My dad came from India in the early 60s and went straight into hard labour. No help. Not a penny given. Double shifts at the steel foundry for YEARS. The kind of work that ruins your body and shortens your life. Heat, noise, pain, exhaustion—day after day. He didn’t get a choice,” she said.Kaur described how her father and uncles endured racism and hardship in the British land but survived, saving money and building a life in a foreign place. “Every shift he worked went into that shop in Newcastle. That shop didn’t come from luck, talk, or ideas. It came from steel work, double shifts and pain… Earned with his body,” she wrote, adding that the whole family contributed to the business, including Kaur and her siblings.Kaur explained that so much physical labour can take a toll on any person, and said that her parents and uncle died young because of it. “No—the generation of immigrants back then weren’t different to the new. The new immigrants ALSO are desperate to work and make a life for themselves,” she said.Kaur concluded by urging a change in how immigrants are viewed in 2026. “This narrative must change and we must give others a chance,” she said. She highlighted every instance of resilience, dedication, and contribution of immigrant families to British society.","British broadcaster and television personality Narinder Kaur has called for immigrants to be given fair chances as the UK enters 2026.

Prank turns deadly: 12-year-old dies imitating 'Squid Game' scene; probe underway,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/prank-turns-deadly-12-year-old-dies-imitating-squid-game-scene-probe-underway/articleshow/126276778.cms,"Representative file photo





A 12-year-old boy has died after attempting to replicate a scene from the South Korean Netflix series Squid Game as a prank.An inquest ruled that the boy, Sebastian Cizman, died by hanging, with reports suggesting he was trying to jokingly imitate a character who died in the same way on the show. Earlier that day, Sebastian, described as a “prankster,” had shared an image of the scene in a WhatsApp group, as reported by The Telegraph.Sebastian’s search history also showed that he had viewed a YouTube video on ‘surviving choking alone.’ His parents, Marcin and Katarzyna, described him as a happy child with no known mental health issues.The Wakefield inquest heard that the “star” schoolboy had been playing with his cousins in the garden before going inside, saying he was tired. He was later found unresponsive on the staircase by one of his cousins after his father, Marcin, returned home from work with ice cream.Despite resuscitation efforts by his parents and paramedics, Sebastian was pronounced dead at the hospital. The inquest also noted that he enjoyed making friends laugh and had previously pretended to be unconscious while play-fighting.Philip Dore, headmaster of St Wilfrid’s Catholic High School in Featherstone, described Sebastian as a popular, happy, and humorous student.Detective sergeant Paul Bayliss suggested that the boy’s “prankster nature,” interest in Squid Game, and the image on his phone offered a possible explanation for his death.“It’s hard what I’m going to say, but I hope that the loss of my child is going to help some other children to understand. And for the people that run these social media platforms to do something, to stop it from happening.How many kids have to die until they do something? My message to other parents is check your children’s phones before it is too late,” Katarzyna Cizman was quoted as saying by the Telegraph.","Sebastian Cizman, 12, died after attempting to replicate a scene from the South Korean Netflix series Squid Game as a prank.

Switzerland Bar Fire: Flame Turns Into Firestorm | How New Year 'APOCALYPSE' Left 155 Casualties





Switzerland's ski resort in town of Crans-Montana witnessed a deadly fire that ripped through a crowded bar in New Year's party and claimed at least 40 lives and left over 100 others injured, as AFP reported.As investigators begin the gruelling task of identifying the victims and trying to determine what happened, here are some of the main issues they will seek to probe.Many videos of the incident were shared on social media, showing the intensity of fire in a picturesque town's bar.One of the video shows, people stuck in bar and panicking as the exit from it was disturbed and under the expanding range of fire.In another video, a ceiling of the bar can be seen in fire and a man trying to get control over it by hitting it with a big white cloth.Another video showing people running here and there in panic the bar, getting out of staircase exit, shouting, trying to find an escape amid fire.The basement venue had only a single staircase exit, forcing panicked patrons to scramble for a way out as flames and smoke tore through the crowd. Horrified bystanders described scenes of “panic” as people tried to break the bar’s windows to escape, while others, covered in burns, stumbled onto the street.Police, firefighters and rescuers rushed to the popular ski resort, set to host the Ski World Cup from January 30, after the fire broke out in the early hours of New Year’s Day.“It was around 1:30 am (0030 GMT) when smoke was spotted coming out of Le Constellation bar at the heart of the resort,” police commander Frederic Gisler told reporters. Moments later, a witness contacted authorities. “Immediately, the red alarm, which mobilises the fire department, was triggered,” he said, adding that firefighters “quickly contained the blaze” as emergency crews treated the injured.Authorities have opened an investigation but declined to speculate on the cause. Several witness accounts broadcast by Swiss, French and Italian media suggested the fire may have ignited when sparklers, mounted on champagne bottles and held aloft by staff as part of a regular show for special orders, came too close to the ceiling.“I think there were some waitresses with champagne bottles and little sparklers. They got too close to the ceiling, and suddenly it all caught fire,” said Axel, who was inside the bar at the time, speaking to Italian outlet Local Team.Le Constellation, located on the ground floor of a residential building, has a capacity of 300 people, with room for another 40 on its terrace, according to the Crans-Montana website. Several witnesses said the basement event space, where the fire is believed to have started, was connected to the ground floor by only one staircase, which some described as “narrow”.Seventeen-year-old Bruno Martins said he arrived to meet friends only to find the bar engulfed in flames and surrounded by police. “It was total panic, people were trampling each other,” he said. At least one of his friends suffered severe burns, while others remained unaccounted for.However, Wallis chief prosecutor Beatrice Pilloud cautioned against drawing conclusions, emphasising that the investigation was ongoing. Responding to reporters, she said she had visited the scene herself. “What exactly constitutes a narrow staircase?” she asked, noting that the probe would determine whether all safety standards were met.Pilloud added that it was still “too early” to comment on whether emergency exits complied with requirements, or whether the proper procedures were followed before organising the New Year’s event.Multiple sources told AFP on Thursday that the bar’s owners, French nationals originally from Corsica, were safe, though they have been unreachable since the tragedy.","Switzerland's ski resort in town of Crans-Montana witnessed a deadly fire that ripped through a crowded bar.
