The pattern extends further north

But does dryness alone explain the scale or spread?

DEHRADUN/KULLU/SRINAGAR: For decades, forest fires in the Himalayas followed a predictable calendar. They started simmering in late spring and early summer, when rising temperatures, dry winds and accumulated leaf litter turned forests combustible. Winter, by contrast, was the season of snow, moisture and relative calm. That rhythm has been breaking for the past few years.This winter, forests across Uttarakhand - and increasingly Himachal Pradesh and Jammu & Kashmir - have been burning with an intensity and frequency that forest officials and scientists say is no longer an anomaly, but indicative of a shifting ecological pattern. ""Forest fires are part of a natural cycle, but climate variability is compressing and intensifying that cycle,"" said Amit Kumar Verma, senior scientist at Dehradun's Forest Research Institute, who is involved in a five-year study to understand shifting forest fire regimes across the country.Data from Doon-based Forest Survey of India (FSI) shows that since the onset of the winter wildfire season on Nov 1, Uttarakhand has recorded the highest number of fire alerts in the country - 1,756 - surpassing states traditionally more forest fire-prone, such as Maharashtra (1,028), Karnataka (924), Madhya Pradesh (868) and Chhattisgarh (862).While officials emphasise that not every satellite alert translates into an active forest fire, the pattern itself is difficult to dismiss.December, typically a low-fire month, emerged as the most active in the state in nearly three years.Data from Doon-based Forest Survey of India (FSI) shows that since the onset of the winter wildfire season on Nov 1, Uttarakhand has recorded the highest number of fire alerts in the country — 1,756 — surpassing states traditionally more forest fire-prone, such as Maharashtra (1,028), Karnataka (924), Madhya Pradesh (868) and Chhattisgarh (862).While officials emphasise that not every satellite alert translates into an active forest fire, the pattern itself is difficult to dismiss.Dec, typically a low-fire month, emerged as the most active in the state in nearly three years. Forest officials attribute much of the spike to extreme dryness. “We have had a completely rainless December. Moisture levels in forest floors are very low,” a senior official said. Like Uttarakhand, Himachal, too, has not received any rainfall since the first week of October last year, and snowfall has been largely absent from major apple-growing belts such as Kullu, Mandi, Shimla and Chamba. This has led to fires sparking across the state’s forests -- maximum at Shimla forest circle (62), followed by Rampur (16), Mandi (8), the Great Himalayan National Park-Kullu (6), Chamba and Kullu (4 each), and Bilaspur and Wildlife (South) circle (2 each) as per data from the state forest department.Kashmir’s forests have been enduring a harsh, snow-deficient winter too. Fires have been reported across the Valley and the Pir Panjal range, including Uri, Bandipora, Nishat and Poonch. In Dec, a forest guard died while fighting a blaze in south Kashmir’s Anantnag district, and on Jan 12, a forest fire in Poonch triggered a series of landmine explosions along the Line of Control after flames spread into mined areas in Balakote and Mendhar sectors. “There is nearly a 40% snowfall deficit after three consecutive dry winters,” said Mudasir Mehmood, DFO Awantipora. “With no soil moisture, it’s no surprise that grass becomes highly flammable.”Officials point to stubble burning in farms close to forest fringes, biomass and solid waste burning, and in some cases, villagers setting fire to forest floors to encourage fresh grass growth for cattle. Anti-forest activities — including poaching and attempts to flush wildlife from cover — are also cited by forest and wildlife experts as possible reasons.According to former Uttarakhand head of forest force Jairaj, forest fires are rarely driven by a single cause. “In high-altitude areas with valuable wildlife like musk deer, poachers sometimes light fires to corner animals during winter when they are already vulnerable. Climate change adds another layer — everything is dry, and even a small spark can escalate into a big blaze,” he said.What is compounding the situation is that traditional forest management practices have eroded. The gradual decline of grazing and community-led clearing has allowed dry grass and leaf litter to accumulate on the forest floor, creating a potent mix that can erupt into a blaze if a carelessly-thrown beedi or half-lit match comes its way. “Earlier, villagers regularly cleared jungle grass. With migration and alternative livelihoods, that practice is fading,” an official said.On the ground, residents are already feeling the impact. In Jyotirmath (formerly Joshimath), 61-year-old Sarvani Devi has been watching, with a wary eye, smoke spiralling from the forest near her house for the past few days. “If these fires spread, everything will turn to ash. That is our biggest fear. Somehow, these mountains, where we have lived all our lives, don’t feel as pleasant anymore.”","December, typically a low-fire month, emerged as the most active in the state in nearly three years.

'Communal reason for not getting work?' Remark by AR Rahman sparks outcry,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/communal-reason-for-not-getting-work-remark-by-ar-rahman-sparks-outcry/articleshow/126629332.cms,"AR Rahman

AR Rahman Responds to Ramayan Controversy, Calls Epic a Story of Values Beyond Religion

Composer A R Rahman's claims that he possibly faced instances of ""communal"" discrimination in the last eight years in Bollywood caused an outcry on Saturday. During an interview with BBC Asian Network, Rahman was asked, "". ..today there's a lot of discrimination against the Tamil community within Bollywood. What was it like in the 1990s. Did you ever face...""Before the question was completed, Rahman answered, ""Maybe I didn't get to know all this stuff. Maybe God concealed all this stuff (laughed). I never felt all those..."" before he went on to say, ""Past eight years, maybe, because the power shift has happened... people who are not creative have the power now to decide things. And this might have been a communal thing also, but not in my face. But I would hear like Chinese whispers that this happened. And they booked you and the music company went and funded the movie and got five composers. And I said, 'Oh, that's great. Rest for me'.""The answer put out verbatim suggested there was a possible communal angle to some producers preferring other musicians. The interview said “you’re very proud of the soundtrack of ‘Chhaava’ and it is a really good soundtrack, but it is a divisive film.”The composer said, “It is… I think it cashed on divisiveness. But I think the core of it is to show bravery.”Interestingly, A R Rahman said that the director insisted on him working for the project. In his words, “The director, I told him like, ‘why do you need me for this?’ He said, ‘We need only you for this’.” ‘Chhaava’, directed by Laxman Utekar, was among biggest hits of 2025.The maestro has won a clutch of National Awards for best music; more recently for ‘Kaatru Veliyidai’ (Tamil, 2017) and ‘Mom’ (Hindi, 2017) and ‘Ponniyin Selvan 1’ (Tamil, 2022).Writer-lyricist Javed Akhtar sought to play down the controversy. Speaking to IANS, Akhtar said, “People in Mumbai have great respect for him. Maybe they think he has got busy with the West (producers). Or they think he is busier with his big shows. Small producers are also scared to approach him. I don’t think there is any communal element.”Bollywood singer Shaan also said there’s unlikely to be any communal angle to the situation. He told IANS, “I have sung so much over the years, yet even I don’t get work at times. But I don’t take it personally, because it is a personal matter; everyone has their own thinking and their own preferences… Rahman saab has a signature style and he is a great composer. His number of fans hasn’t gone down, but are increasing. I don’t think there is any communal or minority angle in music. Music doesn’t work that way.”","A R Rahman was asked about discrimination against the Tamil community in Bollywood. He said, ""Maybe I didn't get to know all this stuff.

NEW DELHI: The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) and Maharashtra civic elections 2026 have marked a decisive shift in the urban political landscape. Held after a delay of nearly four years due to legal challenges and prolonged administrator rule, the elections across 27 municipal corporations and 2,869 seats were widely seen as a test of governance credibility and of existence for some.The verdict was emphatic. The BJP-led Mahayuti alliance emerged as the dominant force in urban Maharashtra, winning 25 of the 29 municipal corporations across the state. In Mumbai, the Mahayuti crossed the majority threshold in the 227-member BMC, with the BJP seizing over 89 wards alone in its favour.With this, there ended the Shiv Sena 's uninterrupted control of the civic body since 1997 and marked the BJP’s first real capture of India’s richest municipal corporation.The biggest and the obvious winner of the civic polls verdict is Devendra Fadnavis and the Bharatiya Janata Party.The BJP has won over 89 wards of the BMC on its own, compared to 82 in 2017. In key wards such as Mulund West (Ward 103), the BJP defeated the MNS by a margin exceeding 12,000 votes.The BJP has emerged as the single largest party in Navi Mumbai with 65 seats, Kalyan-Dombivli (50), Mira-Bhayandar (78), Nashik (72), Panvel (55), Pune (119), Pimpri-Chinchwad (84), Solapur (87), Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar (57), Nanded (45) and Nagpur (102).The saffron party stunned the Pawars in the Pune polls, clinching 119 seats, with Ajit Pawar-led NCP coming in distant second with 27 and its ally NCP (SP) getting three seats, while the Congress managed 15 seats.In the 151-member Nagpur civic body, the BJP held sway, getting 102, while the Congress bagged a mere 34.Nashik saw the BJP bagging 72 seats, Shiv Sena 26, Shiv Sena (UBT) 15, Congress 3 and NCP 4.The BJP's victory streak continued in Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar, where it won 57 seats, followed by Shiv Sena with 15, Congress with one, while other parties registered with the SEC, especially the AIMIM, bagged 33 seats.With the BMC’s annual budget exceeding Rs 60,000 crore, control over Mumbai’s civic machinery also enhances the BJP’s long-term institutional leverage ahead of the 2029 assembly elections.For the Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena, the civic results offered political validation.Since the 2022 split, the Shinde faction’s central challenge has been legitimacy. The civic verdict, particularly in Mumbai and Thane, strengthened its claim. The party won 399 wards and emerged as the second largest party in Maharashtra civic polls.In Mira-Bhayandar and Ulhasnagar, the Shinde faction recorded near-sweeps, reflecting voter preference for continuity in infrastructure delivery over symbolic politics.The BJP–Shiv Sena–NCP Mahayuti alliance once again sealed the victory in Maharashtra.Despite contesting separately in some cities, the alliance demonstrated effective vote transferability in Mumbai, Nashik, and Nagpur.The alliance won 1,991 of 2,869 wards across Maharashtra.With a major victory, Mahayuti showed how to converted state-level power into grassroots and civic dominance.The All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) made modest but consequential gains in Maharashtra civic elections.It won 33 seats in the Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar Municipal Corporation and bagged a total of 126 seats across Maharashtra.The improved tally in Sambhajinagar marked a clear jump from the 2015 municipal corporation elections, when the party had secured 24 seats.AIMIM also registered gains in several urban pockets across the state.The party has won 21 seats in Malegaon, 14 in Nanded Waghala, 12 in Amravati, 10 in Dhule, 8 in Solapur, and eight in Mumbai. It also secured six seats in Nagpur, three in Akola, two each in Ahilyanagar and Jalna, and five seats in Thane.While these numbers remain small, AIMIM’s presence seems to have fragmented the opposition vote, particularly hurting Congress and Shiv Sena (UBT).When the results of the Maharashtra civic elections were being tallied, one of the most unexpected stories to emerge was not about seats won or wards lost. It was about narrative currency — how a Tamil Nadu BJP leader emerged as a winner without contesting.And it all started with the 'rasmalai' controversy which begun when while campaigning in Mumbai for the BMC elections, Annamalai had said the city didn't belong to Maharashtra alone as it was an international city.The remarks triggered a sharp exchange at a joint Shiv Sena (UBT)–MNS rally in Mumbai. MNS chief Raj Thackeray took a swipe at Annamalai, mocking him as 'rasmalai' and questioning his authority to comment on Mumbai. He also raised the slogan “hatao lungi, bajao pungi”, a phrase long used derogatorily against South Indians in the city.However, Mahayuti won and BJP MPs and supporters were soon having a field on social media, posting photos of 'rasmalai' and mocking Raj Thackeray.The biggest electoral setback was suffered by Uddhav Thackeray. From over 130 BMC seats in 2017, Sena (UBT) fell to 65 seats. Even traditional strongholds such as Gorai and parts of Mahim witnessed defeats.The loss of control of the BMC is a big blow to Uddhav the Sena has always maintained its control over the civic body.His long-anticipated reunion with estranged cousin Raj Thackeray also failed to make any impact on the ground.Overall, the party managed to bag only 155 across the state.The Indian National Congress emerged as one of the biggest losers of the BMC and Maharashtra civic elections because the results exposed its near-total erosion in urban politics.In the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, Congress, which fought in alliance with Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA), bagged 24 seats, a sharp fall from its already diminished presence in 2017, when it had crossed 30. Across Maharashtra’s 27 municipal corporations, the party managed roughly 324 wards out of 2,869.The Congress, which ran a muted campaign in the run-up to the polls, managed significant victories in Bhiwandi, where it won 30 seats, Chandrapur 27, and Latur 43.In Pune, once a Congress-influenced city, the party was restricted to fewer than five seats out of 162, while in Mumbai it failed to emerge as a serious contender in most wards.In Pune, it was reduced to fewer than five seats. The party which decided to go solo after that Thackeray cousins jouned hands, failed to make any impact in BMC polls where Uddhav's Sena won 72 seats.It seems that lack of a city-specific agenda, factional infighting and minimal national leadership presence during the campaign compounded the decline.For Raj Thackeray, the civic polls reinforced a long-term downward trajectory.The leader joined hands with his cousin Uddhav to keep the BJP at bay. But the results show how he failed miserably.During the election campaign, he tried to appeal around the idea of the 'Marathi Manoos' while invoking Balasaheb Thackeray. This politics of sentiment obviously has deep roots in Maharashtra’s history.He relied on fiery speeches, symbolic gestures and cultural flashpoints to command attention, often targeting migrants, linguistic outsiders, or perceived cultural dilution in Mumbai. Unlike mass welfare or governance-driven politics, his appeal was rooted in 'Marathi asmita'.This, however, failed to resonate with the voters. The MNS failed to secure major wins, while getting only 6 of 227 wards in Mumbai.At the state level, the party managed to get only 13 of 2869 wards.Sharad Pawar emerged as one of the biggest losers of the BMC and Maharashtra civic elections as the results exposed the steady erosion of his once-formidable grip over urban and organisational politics.For decades, Pawar was seen as the master strategist of Maharashtra, capable of shaping outcomes even when not in direct power. The civic verdict punctured that perception. The NCP (Sharad Pawar faction) failed to make any meaningful impact in the BMC, getting just 1 win in Mumbai wards and remaining marginal in Pune, a city long considered central to Pawar’s political influence.His strategy to join hands with nephew Ajit Pawar for the Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad municipal elections also failed as the BJP secured victory in these bodies.Statewide, the faction’s ward tally was 36 of 2869 wards, far below expectations for a party led by a veteran of his stature.Crucially, Pawar’s traditional role as an alliance-builder also lost relevance. Fragmentation within the opposition and the rise of a dominant Mahayuti alliance reduced his ability to act as a power broker. This time, though reports suggested he wanted the Maha Vikas Agadi to fight as a unit, he failed to keep the parties together, especially after the Thackeray cousins joined hands, pushing Congress to go solo.Despite being part of Mahayuti, Ajit Pawar has emerged as one of the losers this election. During the civic poll campaigns, Ajit Pawar repeatedly hit out at his own Mahayuti allies, Eknath Shinde and Devendra Fadnavis, exposing visible faultlines within the ruling alliance.As election date approached, he finally decided to unite with his uncle Sharad Pawar to contest Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad elections as a united front.His attacks were also unusually sharp for an alliance partner, with Pawar questioning why local bodies under BJP–Shinde control still struggled with water supply, roads and urban planning. In several rallies, he projected his faction as a corrective force within the government rather than a stakeholder in its record. .The civic results however suggest the tactic backfired. Ajit Pawar’s faction underperformed in Pune and Nashik, reinforcing the perception that public sparring with allies during elections diluted his credibility and bargaining power within the Mahayuti rather than strengthening it.Eventually, the Pawar lost their strongholds, Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad, to BJP with huge margin.","The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) and Maharashtra civic elections 2026 have marked a decisive shift in the urban political landscape.

Super Bowl 2026 playoff picture, odds, date, location and halftime show



Super Bowl 2026 is almost near as the NFL postseason tightens and the championship picture sharpens. Sunday’s action delivered clarity and drama in equal measure, trimming the field and pushing the league closer to crowning its next champion. Fans now have real matchups to debate, odds to track, and dates to circle as the road to February gains momentum.New England set the tone early. The Patriots handled the Houston Texans 28-16 in the AFC Divisional Round, a composed performance that underlined their playoff experience. That win locked in an AFC Championship clash with the Denver Broncos, while the NFC picture hinges on a high stakes meeting between the Chicago Bears and Los Angeles Rams. The winner earns a trip to face the Seattle Seahawks, who continue to look like the team everyone wants to avoid.The updated Super Bowl odds reflect how tight the race has become. Seattle leads the board at +145, rewarded for its balance and late season consistency. New England sits close behind at +250, proving once again that the Patriots thrive when the margin for error disappears. The Rams follow at +315, while Denver and Chicago remain longer shots at +1000 and +1600, respectively.Beyond the matchups, the calendar now matters. The 2026 Super Bowl will be played on Sunday, February 8, with kickoff scheduled for 6:30 p.m. ET. The stage is Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, California, marking the second time the venue will host the league’s biggest night after Super Bowl 50. NBC will carry the broadcast, continuing its long standing relationship with marquee NFL events.The spectacle extends well past the game itself. This year, Bad Bunny will headline the Apple Music Halftime Show. The global star behind “DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS” is expected to take the stage shortly after the second quarter, likely between 5 and 5:30 p.m. PT. Fans are already buzzing about possible guest appearances, with names like Cardi B, J Balvin, Jennifer Lopez, and Ricky Martin circulating due to past collaborations.For those hoping to attend in person, tickets remain available but come at a premium. Packages through the NFL’s official hospitality partner, On Location, start around $7,100 per person, a reminder that as Super Bowl 2026 draws closer, access becomes as exclusive as the moment itself.","The 2026 Super Bowl will be played on Sunday, February 8, with kickoff scheduled for 6:30 p.m. ET.

Bill Belichick returns to TV as ESPN adds him to national title broadcast

Bill Belichick is back on television. Just weeks after finishing a difficult first college football season at the University of North Carolina, the 73-year-old coaching legend has landed a new role with ESPN. The network confirmed that Bill Belichick will appear on the ACC Network’s broadcast of the College Football Playoff national championship game, set to be played in South Florida at Hard Rock Stadium.The game will feature the Indiana Hoosiers against the University of Miami Hurricanes and is scheduled for a 7:30 p.m. kickoff. ESPN announced that Belichick will be part of the on-air team, marking his return to TV while he continues working as head coach of the Tar Heels in Chapel Hill.ESPN said Bill Belichick will be paired with former Miami and Georgia head coach Mark Richt for the ACC Network’s coverage.The move comes only weeks after North Carolina ended a rough season with a 4–8 record, missing both a bowl game and the expanded College Football Playoff.Belichick became North Carolina’s head coach in 2025, taking his first job at the college level after leaving the New England Patriots following the 2024 NFL season.Before going to Chapel Hill, he spent months on television. He appeared on “Monday Night Football’s ManningCast” with Peyton Manning and Eli Manning and also made regular appearances on The Pat McAfee Show.Now, Bill Belichick is mixing both worlds. He is still leading North Carolina’s rebuild, but he is also stepping back into the media spotlight.ESPN’s announcement said the move brings “one of football’s greatest minds” back to the broadcast booth.Belichick is the only head coach in NFL history to win six Super Bowls with one team. He also won two more Super Bowls as a defensive coordinator with the New York Giants.While returning to television, Bill Belichick has stayed busy on the recruiting trail. One of his biggest recent moves was bringing in quarterback Billy Edwards Jr. to Chapel Hill.ESPN’s Pete Thamel reported that Edwards chose North Carolina after being granted a medical redshirt, giving him one more year of college eligibility.Billy Edwards Jr., a Virginia native, transferred to Wisconsin in August 2025 after playing at Maryland.He later suffered a knee injury and missed the rest of the season. Now, he will compete with Gio Lopez for the Tar Heels’ starting job.He will also work under Belichick and new offensive coordinator Bobby Petrino, another longtime NFL coach.The addition matters for a North Carolina team that struggled badly. The Tar Heels beat only two Power Four teams, Syracuse and Stanford, during the 2025 season.Off the field, Belichick has also faced attention around his personal life, including heavy media focus on his relationship with Jordon Hudson.Despite the noise, sources around the program say Belichick has stayed locked in on recruiting and player development.North Carolina will next hold its spring game on April 12 at Kenan Stadium, where fans will get their first look at the new roster.","Bill Belichick will appear on the ACC Network’s broadcast of the College Football Playoff national championship game.

Rasmus Andersson trade reshapes Vegas and Calgary futures



Rasmus Andersson’s trade marks the end of a defining chapter in Calgary, and it reshapes the Western Conference race in one decisive stroke. The Flames have officially moved their longtime blue line anchor, retaining half of his contract, and sent him to the Vegas Golden Knights in a blockbuster deal that signals two franchises heading in very different directions.For Calgary, this moment felt inevitable. The organization has been listening, weighing, and waiting. With time still left before the 2026 trade deadline, the Flames finally acted, converting one of the league’s most valuable trade assets into future-focused returns. Vegas, meanwhile, doubled down on urgency. Sitting atop the Pacific Division, the Golden Knights chose certainty over patience and paid accordingly to strengthen a defense built for playoff battles.The trade package reflects how highly Andersson was valued across the league. Calgary receives veteran defenseman Zach Whitecloud, a 2027 first-round pick, a conditional 2027 second-round pick that escalates if Vegas wins the Stanley Cup, and defense prospect Abram Wiebe from the University of North Dakota. TSN’s Darren Dreger confirmed Calgary’s decision to retain 50 percent of Andersson’s salary, a move that maximized return while easing Vegas’s cap structure.At 29, Andersson leaves behind a decade-long run with the Flames, having grown from a steady defender into one of the NHL’s most productive right shots. This season alone, he has posted 30 points in 48 games, ranking 20th among defensemen, with 10 goals just shy of a career best. He now joins a Vegas roster designed to win now, even without a contract extension in place. His pending free agency adds intrigue, but Vegas is clearly betting that results will speak louder than paperwork.Boston’s role in the chase adds another layer. The Bruins explored the possibility, even gaining permission to discuss an extension, but restraint won out. Still in a re-tool phase, Boston chose not to sacrifice young talent and premium picks for what could have been a short-term rental. That decision cost them Andersson, but it reinforced a measured approach to roster building.For Vegas, the price was steep and deliberate. For Calgary, the return sets a new timeline. The Rasmus Andersson era is over, but for both teams, the consequences of this trade are only just beginning.","Rasmus Andersson has been traded from the Calgary Flames to the Vegas Golden Knights.

Jim Cornelison national anthem delivers playoff intensity at Soldier Field



Jim Cornelison's national anthem performance echoed through Soldier Field long before the first snap, setting an emotional tone that felt bigger than football. As snow-bitten air wrapped the stadium in Chicago, fans rose early, sensing that something memorable was unfolding. This was not a routine pregame moment. It was a statement, delivered in voice and presence, before the Bears and Rams collided in a high-stakes playoff night.The crowd leaned in as the opening notes rang out, and within seconds, the atmosphere shifted. Players paused. Fans sang along. Television viewers across the country felt it too. The anthem did not just open the game, it grounded it. In a city craving another deep postseason run, the moment captured pride, history, and hope in one sweeping performance.Cornelison’s appearance came ahead of a tense NFC Divisional Round clash, with the No. 2 seed Bears chasing their first conference championship appearance since 2011. Across the field stood the No. 5 seed Rams, a franchise that last tasted Super Bowl glory in 2021 and returned hungry for another shot. Both teams had battled through the wild-card round, earning their place under the bright lights of Soldier Field.Jim Cornelison has become a familiar and trusted voice in Chicago sports, and Sunday night proved why.The 61-year-old delivered “The Star-Spangled Banner” with power and control, drawing cheers that rivaled any touchdown roar. Fans later described the performance as chilling, not because of the weather, but because of its emotional weight.NBC’s national broadcast carried the rendition to millions, giving Cornelison a stage worthy of his reputation. He has sung the anthem at Bears home openers in 2011, 2016, 2019, and 2025, along with playoff games across multiple seasons. Beyond football, he remains a fixture at Chicago Blackhawks games, where he also performs “O, Canada,” and at iconic events like the Indianapolis 500.Cornelison’s reach extends well beyond stadiums. A former member of the Lyric Opera Center for American Artists, he has performed in renowned opera houses worldwide. He also serves on the board of the Illinois Patriot Education Fund and holds the title of honorary squad commander of the U.S. Air Force Band of Mid-America.","Jim Cornelison's national anthem set an emotional tone that felt bigger than football. The anthem did not just open the game, it grounded it.

“He got a side woman pregnant”: Influencer alleges Mike Tomlin’s exit is tied to pregnancy scandal during wife’s cancer fight,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/he-got-a-side-woman-pregnant-influencer-alleges-mike-tomlins-exit-is-tied-to-pregnancy-scandal-during-wifes-cancer-fight/articleshow/126663155.cms,"Mike Tomlin’s resignation from the Pittsburgh Steelers has been overshadowed by an unverified cheating rumor sparked by an influencer’s social media claims. While the allegation has gone viral online, neither Tomlin, the NFL, nor the Steelers have confirmed it. Tomlin cited reflection and gratitude in his statement, as his wife publicly expressed pride and support.

I nfl uencer’s explosive claim clouds Mike Tomlin’s Steelers departure as NFL stays silent

When Mike Tomlin stepped away from the Pittsburgh Steelers, the football world expected reflection, legacy talk, and respectful closure. Instead, the vacuum left by his silence became a breeding ground for speculation. Within hours, social media had shifted the narrative away from football and toward a deeply personal allegation that spread faster than any official explanation.The sudden nature of the exit, paired with Tomlin’s spotless public reputation, created the perfect conditions for rumor to take hold. Influencer commentary, not league statements, began shaping public perception. What followed was not confirmation, but noise. Loud, unverified, and impossible to ignore.Instagram personality Harold White ignited the controversy by repeating claims he said were circulating privately. None have been verified by NFL, the Pittsburgh Steelers, or Mike Tomlin himself. Still, the language of certainty fueled virality.""Why is there a rumor going around about the real reason that Mike Tomlin stepped down from coaching the Pittsburgh Steelers is because he got a side woman pregnant while his wife has cancer and he broke the personal conduct rule or something,"" White said.""And so they trying to keep everything hush.”“Rumor is gaining traction even down to people, they're saying that this woman was a bartender. ... People that work with her are verifying this and they saying that he paid her $3.5 million to stay quiet. I'm getting DMs, people saying this is true, that this is out of Newcastle, Pittsburgh. They have even dropped pictures, allegedly of Tomlin with this mistress.""Tomlin’s actual departure statement struck a sharply different tone. “After much thought and reflection, I have decided to step down as head coach of the Pittsburgh Steelers. This organization has been a huge part of my life for many years, and it has been an absolute honor to lead this team. I am deeply grateful to Art Rooney II and the late Ambassador Rooney for their trust and support.”After 19 seasons, a Super Bowl title, and zero losing records, Tomlin’s résumé remains untouched by scandal in official channels. His wife, Kiya Tomlin, responded with pride and gratitude, not defensiveness. That contrast matters.Until facts replace speculation, this story remains a reminder of how quickly influence can outpace truth in modern sports culture.","Mike Tomlin's resignation from the Pittsburgh Steelers has been overshadowed by an unverified cheating rumor sparked by an influencer’s social media claims.

Harshit Rana press conference: 'Team wants to groom me as an all-rounder'

Harshit Rana recently shared a light moment that perfectly captures Virat Kohli ’s playful side, taking fans back to the celebrations after India’s 2025 Champions Trophy triumph.Recalling the scenes inside the dressing room after the final, Rana said he was part of the squad but did not play the match. When he walked in after the win, he found himself meeting Anushka Sharma for the very first time.“I entered the dressing room, and Anushka Sharma was also there. I was meeting her for the first time. So I called her ‘ma’am’,” Rana said while speaking to MensXP.That, however, quickly turned into a joke at Rana’s expense. Kohli , never one to miss an opportunity for humour, immediately stepped in. “Then he told me, ‘tu ma’am kyu bol raha hai inko? Bhabhi bol inko’,” Rana recalled, laughing at the memory.Rana explained that he tried to justify himself, given it was their first interaction. “I told him that I am meeting her for the first time,” he said. Kohli was not done yet. “Then he told her that I am like that, and just some time ago I poured champagne on him, and I am calling you ma’am now.”When asked if Kohli is really as funny as he sometimes appears on camera, Rana did not hesitate. “A lot, he likes jokes a lot,” he said.Kohli has long been known for his intense and driven approach on the field, especially during his time as India’s captain, when the team reached new standards of fitness and competitiveness.But stories like these underline another side to him, a leader who enjoys keeping the dressing room atmosphere light and relaxed.Rana, meanwhile, has been steadily carving out his place among India’s emerging fast bowlers since making his international debut in 2024. After making his mark with KKR in the IPL, he was part of India’s 2025 Asia Cup-winning squad and has become a trusted option for Shubman Gill in the ongoing ODI series against New Zealand.","Harshit Rana recalls meeting Anushka Sharma for the first time after 2025 Champions Trophy win.

Stefon Diggs under fire after influencer hints at chaos during Cardi B’s childbirth

Shockwaves rippled through social media as a fresh allegation involving Stefon Diggs and Cardi B pushed their already turbulent spotlight into overdrive. The claim did not come from court filings or official statements. It came from influencer chatter.At the center of the controversy is a story tied to childbirth, legal confusion, and personal loyalty. Fans reacted swiftly, some stunned, others skeptical. The situation gained traction not because of proof, but because of how personal the accusation felt. In an era where rumors move faster than facts, silence often becomes part of the story.The controversy stems from remarks made by influencer Celina Powell, who said she learned details from Offset, Cardi B’s ex-husband. According to Powell, Diggs was present briefly during the hospital stay but became upset after learning that Offset’s name could legally appear on the birth certificate due to Cardi B’s marital status at the time. Powell alleged that Diggs left the hospital and was absent for several days afterward. None of these claims have been verified.Diggs and Cardi B have not spoken out against the allegations. Such silence has enabled speculation to thrive and more so as Diggs still continues his season with the New England Patriots under close scrutiny of the public eye.To make it even worse, Diggs is also struggling with another legal issue with a former private chef which is still pending.In the meantime, Cardi B has remained dedicated to her career including building her forthcoming tour. She retained composure in the face of adversaries and this has earned her approval among those who believe that fantasy should not ascribe her personal life.It has caused fans to be divided. There are those who call on restraint and respect, on the want of confirmation. There is an opinion that the accusations are raising great questions that should be clarified. This story is a commentary on the collision of celebrity, influence, and speculation in the moment, until the facts have been proved.","An influencer has sparked online backlash by alleging Stefon Diggs mistreated Cardi B during the birth of their child, claiming he left the hospital amid legal confusion.

What the New York Mets Gain and Weighing Risks

The New York Mets are adjusting after parting ways with a player who spent nearly a decade with the organization. With Brandon Nimmo now in Texas, the front office is focused on finding a short-term outfield option that limits spending and avoids long-term commitments.That approach has led them to Max Kepler. He is not viewed as a marquee signing but as a steady replacement. A reported one-year deal worth $7.6 million would give the Mets reliable defense and left-handed power while preserving roster flexibility.The New York Mets’ direction changed after a one-for-one trade with the Texas Rangers sent Nimmo to Texas in exchange for second baseman Marcus Semien. Nimmo waived his full no-trade clause to complete the deal, ending his eight-year, $162 million tenure in New York.Nimmo was still productive in 2025. He appeared in 143 games and hit .261 with 23 home runs and 82 RBIs. Even so, the Mets chose to address their infield and manage payroll. Semien now anchors second base, but the trade left a clear vacancy in left field.Max Kepler became a free agent after a one-year, $10 million season with Philadelphia that was limited by knee issues. His surface numbers declined, but the Mets value his defense and remaining power.In 2025, he ranked among the league’s best outfield arms and fits cleanly into a corner role.A short-term deal also matches the Mets’ plans. Prospect Carson Benge is expected to push for a larger role soon, and Max Kepler would fill the gap without blocking that path. The lower salary compared to Nimmo’s deal also leaves room to address pitching.Max Kepler would give the Mets steady corner defense, a strong throwing arm, and power against right-handed pitching at a much lower cost. His projected salary is far below Nimmo’s annual average, which helps keep the luxury tax in check.The concerns are durability and age. Kepler is in his mid-30s and coming off a down year. He also does not solve the center-field situation long term, leaving the Mets to rely on internal options.Also read: MLB trade rumors: Cincinnati Reds predicted to sign $10.2 million New York Yankees; Brady Singer key trade asset?

Jalen Williams suffers another injury setback after exiting Heat loss with hamstring issue

Thunder face mounting injury concerns as Jalen Williams and Isaiah Hartenstein remain sidelined

Due to a right hamstring strain, forward Jalen Williams will not play for the Oklahoma City Thunder against the Cleveland Cavaliers on the road on Monday. Williams was hurt in the second quarter of Oklahoma City's 122-120 road defeat to the Miami Heat on Saturday.He is classified as out for Monday's road game against Cleveland at 1:30 p.m. CST, but a date for his recovery has not yet been provided. After having their five-game winning streak ended on Saturday in Miami, Oklahoma City is trying to get back on track on Monday, but the Thunder will have a hard time getting back on track due to their injury report. OKC will probably rely on Ajay Mitchell.Jalen Williams has a right hamstring strain, according to the OKC Thunder's injury report released on Sunday. However, Williams has only appeared in 24 of Oklahoma City's 43 games this season due to injury.Midway through the second quarter of Oklahoma City's 122-120 loss to the Miami Heat on Saturday night, Williams left the game due to what the Thunder at the time described as thigh soreness.Williams had a terrible setback after missing the first 19 games of the season due to a right shooting wrist injury that necessitated two surgeries.The All-NBA forward averages 4.8 rebounds, 5.6 assists, and 16.8 points.Jalen Williams turned the corner downhill from a Chet Holmgren screen in the middle of the second quarter of a game in which he looked more like himself than at any other point this season. As the defense collapsed on him, he attempted to loft a pass to Holmgren, but it sailed out of bounds as Williams reached for the back side of his leg, hobbling the baseline and remaining on that end of the court unable to get back on defense.The 2022 lottery pick was able to gather himself under the hoop and limp to the locker room as the Oklahoma City Thunder called a timeout during the Heat's five-on-four possession. Due to pain in his right thigh, the squad decided to bench him for the second half in South Beach.Since the Thunder selected him 12th overall in the 2022 draft, the fourth-year professional, who was an All-Star last season, has averaged 18.0 points, 4.6 rebounds, 4.4 assists, and 1.4 steals per game in 239 games.Isaiah Hartenstein, the Thunder's big man, was also sidelined for the 12th consecutive game due to a calf injury. How long the reigning NBA champions will be without their all-star forward is unclear.With 16.8 points per game, Williams is third on the club. He also averages 5.6 assists, 4.8 rebounds, and 1.3 steals. Two of OKC's regular starters are now out. Due to a right soleus (calf) injury, Isaiah Hartenstein will also miss his 12th consecutive game on Monday.Darius Garland is expected to lose a lengthy amount of time for the Cavaliers due to a right great toe sprain, thus Cleveland is also short-staffed going into this game. For this midday match, Max Strus and Sam Merrill will accompany him in street attire.","Jalen Williams has a right hamstring strain, according to the OKC Thunder's injury report released on Sunday.

Nick Foles offers calm perspective that sparks hope for Broncos Country after Bo Nix injury



The Denver Broncos are approaching the AFC Championship Game under circumstances few expected just a week ago. Rookie quarterback Bo Nix suffered a season ending ankle injury in the divisional round, forcing Denver to quickly rethink its postseason approach. The loss of their starting quarterback has naturally shifted expectations and created uncertainty around the offense.With kickoff drawing closer and emotions still fresh, Broncos Country has been searching for reassurance. While the team has turned to its depth chart for answers on the field, perspective from outside the locker room has also helped steady the mood ahead of a matchup that now carries even more weight.Former NFL quarterback Nick Foles provided that perspective with a thoughtful social media message on Sunday evening. Drawing from his own experience, Foles acknowledged how difficult the moment feels for players and fans alike while pointing to a reason for cautious optimism.“Note for the Broncos and their fans: I know it has been an emotional 24 hours,” Foles tweeted. “I feel for Bo and the team, and I'm sending prayers for a strong recovery.A positive note going into the game versus the Patriots is that they struggle against backup QBs in championship-type games.”The message resonated as Foles has experienced almost the same case. In the 2017 season, he replaced an injured Carson Wentz and proceeded to bring the Philadelphia Eagles into a Super Bowl victory over New England. His post season performance is one of the most memorable performances by a backup quarterback who succeeds on the biggest stage.It is now left to Jarrett Stidham who will be making his first career postseason start. It is even more engaging with the plot when Stidham is set to confront his ex-team, the New England Patriots, in a Super Bowl bid.Denver is not requesting Stidham to re-write history overnight. Rather he will be looking at execution, being calm and being dependent on the roster around him. With the approaching AFC Championship, the words of Foles have made Broncos fans change to being shocked to believing that there is still a chance, that opportunity would arise even at the most unexpected moments.",Former NFL quarterback Nick Foles tweeted his support for the Denver Broncos. The Broncos are without starting quarterback Bo Nix for the AFC Championship Game. Jarrett Stidham will be making his first career postseason start.

Madison Beer’s big week contrasts with Justin Herbert’s playoff exit



Also read

The end of the NFL season can feel abrupt, especially for teams with playoff expectations. For the Los Angeles Chargers, that reality arrived quickly after their wild-card loss to the New England Patriots. While the defeat closed the book on another challenging year for Justin Herbert , the week unfolded very differently for someone close to him.As Herbert processed the disappointment of an early playoff exit, his girlfriend, Madison Beer, was celebrating a major career moment. The singer released her new album, Locket, on Friday, and the rollout came with a highly visible spotlight. An advertisement for the album appeared on a Times Square jumbotron in New York City, marking a milestone moment in her music career.Beer shared photos of the Times Square display on her Instagram story, pairing the photos with her song “For the Night.” The timing stood out. While Herbert’s season had just ended in frustration, Beer was enjoying one of the biggest promotional moments of her career. The Chargers’ playoff run ended with a loss to New England, despite the team making it back to the postseason. Herbert struggled to find consistency during the game and finished with 159 passing yards.Afterward, he addressed his performance honestly in his postgame comments. ""I didn't play weel enough and didn't make any plays,"" Herbert said. ""We let the defense down today.""The loss marked Herbert’s third career playoff appearance, but once again, the Chargers failed to reach the divisional round. It added to the growing pressure surrounding a quarterback who has delivered strong regular-season play but has yet to make a deep postseason run.Earlier in the week, Beer had another milestone moment when she appeared on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. The performance came just ahead of the album release and marked her debut on the late-night stage. She later shared photos and videos from the appearance on Instagram with a caption that captured her excitement. ""oh what a night! bad enough debut on @fallontonight""For the show, Beer wore an off-white halter-neck dress with a fitted silhouette and a high slit, drawing attention as she promoted her new music. Herbert and Beer confirmed their relationship publicly in October, when they were seen sharing a kiss on the sidelines before a Chargers game against Washington. Since then, Beer has regularly been spotted supporting Herbert at games, including a Week 17 appearance against the Houston Texans.As Herbert heads into another offseason focused on improvement and answers, Beer’s career continues to gain momentum.","Madison Beer released her new album, Locket, on Friday.

Nicol Delago’s breakthrough and Lindsey Vonn’s experience light up Tarvisio



Italy’s alpine ski team continues its strong run with less than three weeks left before the Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics. On Saturday, Nicol Delago delivered a landmark moment by winning her first World Cup race in the downhill on home snow in Tarvisio. The result added to the growing confidence around the Italian camp as Olympic preparations enter the final stretch.The race also underlined the remarkable form of Lindsey Vonn . At 41, the American legend finished third, securing her fifth podium in five downhill races this season. With the Olympics approaching in Italy, both Delago’s breakthrough victory and Vonn’s consistency sent a strong message to the rest of the field.Nicol Delago topped the timing sheets with a winning margin of 0.20 seconds over Germany’s Kira Weidle-Winkelmann. Lindsey Vonn followed closely, just 0.26 seconds behind the Italian. Delago had shown strong signs earlier by leading the final training session on Friday. Until now, her best World Cup results had been three second-place and two third-place finishes. Her younger sister, Nadia Delago, who won Olympic bronze in downhill at the 2022 Beijing Games, finished 10th in this race.The Tarvisio downhill returned to the World Cup calendar for the first time in 15 years. Vonn was one of only two skiers in the field with prior racing experience on the course. In her earlier appearances at Tarvisio across different disciplines, she had recorded two victories and four second-place finishes. After the race, Vonn explained that while the track itself felt unfamiliar, she clearly remembered the electric atmosphere.Talking about the race, it was quite challenging due to fog hanging over the middle section of the course, reducing visibility. Delago briefly lost control when her skis split apart in the fog but recovered quickly. She then increased her lead at every split and celebrated joyfully at the finish. Vonn posted the fastest speeds at both checkpoints, reaching 136.3 kph, but a slight detour into fresh snow cost her time.In the downhill standings, Vonn extended her lead to 144 points over Emma Aicher. She also moved up to third overall with 510 points. The Olympic downhill in Cortina is set for February 8, with a super-G scheduled in Tarvisio on Sunday.","Nicol Delago wins her first World Cup downhill on home snow in Tarvisio.

Cardi B’s post-rhinoplasty look

When Grammy-winning rapper Cardi B was spotted in a Gillette Stadium VIP suite, cheering on her boyfriend Stefon Diggs with New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, we knew something was amiss. Something was pin pointing to their shared history. But who would go back and turn the pages of history? No worries. We’ve done that for all.The “Bodak Yellow” singer was spotted dancing with the Patriots owner at a Fanatics party during Super Bowl LIII weekend in Atlanta in 2019. Cardi was scheduled to perform at Michael Rubin’s Fanatics party at the College Football Hall of Fame.The “Am I the Drama?” creator co-headlined the event with rapper Meek Mill, who partnered with Kraft on Reform Alliance, a criminal justice reform organization supported by Jay-Z and Van Jones.In a 2019 appearance on 98.5 The Sports Hub’s “Toucher and Rich” program [now, it’s Toucher & Hardy], Kraft discussed forging relationships with the hip-hop community.“Honest to goodness, I don’t force it,” Kraft said. “We live in a world where all of us have to find ways to build bridges and connect with everybody. There’s good in every situation, and you try to understand it and relate to it.That’s how you understand how the world works, when you try to keep people together to win championships, which is not easy, guys.”The Patriots had beaten the Los Angeles Rams 13-3 and won Super Bowl LIII. It was the sixth and final Super Bowl win for Tom Brady as a Patriot. He won his seventh Super Bowl as a Buccaneer. Anyway, coming back to Kraft and Cardi B. What happened at the party?Kraft danced to Cardi B’s performance on her song “Money.” Describing the dance with Offset’s ex-wife, Kraft said, “Meek Mill kept saying, ‘You gotta go out there. You gotta go out there. They don’t think you can dance.’Once someone puts you on the defensive, they don’t expect me to follow the beat, not that I had much rhythm. I don’t think most of my colleagues expect to see me Super Bowl weekend hanging with Cardi B and trying to show her a few moves.”Dov Kleiman, an NFL aggregator, shared a wholesome picture of Kraft and Cardi taken six years after their first meeting. Notable changes: The owner has reportedly lost a few pounds, while the “I Like It” singer is sporting her post-Rhinoplasty look.Diggs’ partner underwent a nose job [rhinoplasty] in 2020. She tried non-surgical nose fillers around 2018-2019, but they made her nose look longer and wider. So, she had corrective surgery in 2020 because the fillers backfired.“I always felt like I had a big nose,” Cardi said via The Glow Memo’s Michelle Villett. “Even before I was famous, I was like, ‘Damn, I’ve got my daddy’s nose.’ I was always afraid to do my nose, and I finally took the step.”Also Read: Stefon Diggs scans the stands searching for Cardi B after New England Patriots’ big 42-10 win over New York Jets",New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft and rapper Cardi B were spotted together at Super Bowl LIII.

Lamar Odom’s past struggles with addiction resurface amid renewed legal concerns

The Kardashians,

Lamar Odom, a former NBA player, is once again in the news, this time for an arrest in Las Vegas that has sparked new worries about his protracted, well-publicized struggle with addiction. After being stopped early on Saturday morning, the former NBA player was taken into custody and charged with driving while intoxicated. The issue is still being looked into.In addition, he was found guilty of two traffic infractions: illegal lane change/failure to maintain lane and exceeding the speed limit by more than 41 miles per hour. Odom appears to still be detained as of the time of publication. Notably, Odom was previously wed to Khloé Kardashian.According to TMZ, Lamar Odom was taken into custody in Las Vegas. According to arrest documents obtained by Us Weekly, Odom, 46, was taken into custody on Saturday, January 17, and charged with several offences, including speeding, driving while intoxicated, and changing lanes improperly.Before being stopped by police, Odom allegedly drove about 40 miles over the speed limit and struggled to stay in his lane, according to TMZ.Odom was being held at the Clark County Detention Centre on a $4,000 bail as of Saturday afternoon. Odom was given bail, according to jail records, and his court date is set for Tuesday, March 17.Odom has been openly discussing his battles with drinking, drug addiction, and unresolved childhood trauma for years before this incident. Odom discussed the loss of his mother at a young age in a 2019 interview, describing it as a wound that ""may never fully heal,"" but stressing that his rehabilitation made him thankful to be alive.Fans and detractors alike are once again keeping an eye on Odom as he gets ready to deal with the legal ramifications of his most recent arrest to see if this is another setback or a turning point in his continuous quest for sobriety.During and during his brief marriage to Khloé Kardashian, Odom's substance usage problems gained widespread attention. Odom has a history of substance and alcohol abuse. In 2013, he was arrested for DUI.He almost died in 2015 after overdosing on drugs at a Nevada legal brothel, which left him unconscious for several days. In order to take care of him while he recovered, Kardashian put a temporary stop to their divorce.When he regained consciousness, the former Los Angeles Lakers player claims he was shocked to see Kardashian beside his bedside. He said at the time:“It was definitely a moment of relief. I didn’t even know what had just happened,” “She played a major role in me getting my memory back. She would bring pictures of my mother and my grandmother. I kept thinking, ‘Am I paralyzed forever? Am I mute forever?' It was scary s***. Faith got me through.”Kardashian sought for divorce again after his rehabilitation, and the divorce was finalized in 2016. On a 2025 episode ofKardashian referred to Odom as ""the love of my life"" and acknowledged that their marriage had problems that were eventually irreversible, despite the fact that the couple had reconciled almost ten years after their breakup.In recent years, Odom has dedicated himself to sobriety and has even offered assistance to those who are battling addiction, such as Bam Margera, through a number of rehabilitation facilities he owns. He has even discussed his dedication to sobriety in recent years. But the arrest on Saturday creates new concerns regarding his recuperation process.","Lamar Odom, 46, was arrested in Las Vegas on Saturday morning.

Allan Donald on Virat Kohli’s legacy: Can he reach 100 centuries?

Poll What do you think is India's biggest area for improvement after the recent ODI series against New Zealand? Batting depth Bowling consistency Fielding performance Strategic decisions

NEW DELHI: India captain Shubman Gill struck a candid and reflective note after his side slumped to a 41-run defeat against New Zealand in the series-deciding ODI on Sunday, admitting that while Virat Kohli ’s batting continues to be a massive positive, the team still has “a lot of areas” that need improvement.Kohli, once again, stood tall in adversity, smashing a record-extending 54th ODI century — his 85th international hundred — but his valiant effort went in vain as India were bowled out for 296 in 46 overs while chasing a stiff target of 338 at the Holkar Stadium. New Zealand clinched the series after India had entered the contest level at 1-1.“After the first match, coming here 1-1, the way we played — a bit disappointed,” Gill said at the post-match presentation. “Lots of areas that need some improvement. There are areas we need to look back, reflect and do better.”Despite the defeat, Gill was quick to underline the positives, led, inevitably, by Kohli’s form. “The way Virat bhai is batting, that’s definitely a plus always,” the skipper said, acknowledging the senior batter’s consistency and impact even as results eluded the team.India’s chase had unravelled early at 71 for four, but Kohli revived hopes with a fighting 124 off 108 balls, laced with 10 fours and three sixes.He stitched together an 88-run stand with Nitish Kumar Reddy (53) and later added 99 runs for the seventh wicket with Harshit Rana (52), briefly keeping India in the hunt.Gill also praised Rana’s all-round contribution, particularly his batting down the order. “The way Harshit has batted in this series, batting at No. 8 is not easy, but the way he stepped up and the way our fast bowlers have bowled in this series has been pretty good,” he said.On Nitish Kumar Reddy, Gill stressed that opportunities would continue with an eye on the bigger picture. “Keeping the World Cup in mind and where it’s going to be, we want to give him opportunities and we want to give him enough overs when he’s out there and just see what kind of combinations work for us and what kind of deliveries work for him as well.”Kohli’s hundred added several milestones to his glittering career. It was his seventh ODI century against New Zealand — the most by any batter — and his 10th hundred overall against the Kiwis across formats. He also surpassed Ricky Ponting to become the leading run-scorer in ODIs at No. 3.",India captain Shubman Gill admits India have a lot of areas for improvement.

NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli’s sublime century once again underlined his enduring greatness, even though it came in a losing cause as New Zealand clinched the ODI series 2-1 with a 41-run win in the decider on Sunday. Kohli’s 108-ball 124 — his record-extending 54th ODI hundred — was the centrepiece of India’s chase, but it was not enough after the hosts were set a daunting target of 338 and eventually bowled out for 296 in 46 overs.India had slipped to 71 for four, and despite fighting half-centuries from Nitish Kumar Reddy (53) and Harshit Rana (52), the deficit proved too steep. Earlier, centuries from Daryl Mitchell (137) and Glenn Phillips (106) powered New Zealand to 337 for eight, with Zak Foulkes and Kristian Clarke sharing six wickets in India’s reply.While the series ended in disappointment for India, it proved historic for Kohli, who continues to rewrite the record books with remarkable consistency. His hundred in Indore was his seventh ODI century against New Zealand, the most by any batter against the Kiwis in the format, surpassing legends like Ricky Ponting and Virender Sehwag - six each. Overall, it was Kohli’s 10th international century against New Zealand, again the most by any batter across formats.The knock also took Kohli to 59 List-A hundreds, placing him just one shy of Sachin Tendulkar’s all-time record of 60 — a milestone firmly within reach. At home, Kohli registered his 41st international hundred on Indian soil, moving closer to Tendulkar’s record of 42.Another landmark saw Kohli go past Ricky Ponting to become the highest run-scorer at No.3 in ODI cricket, amassing 12,676 runs from that position. His century in Indore also meant Kohli has now scored hundreds at 35 different ODI venues, the most by any batter, overtaking Tendulkar.Kohli also joined a slightly unwanted list, registering his ninth ODI hundred in a losing cause, equalling Brendon Taylor and trailing only Tendulkar (14) and Chris Gayle (11). His dominance against multiple opponents remains staggering, with seven or more hundreds now against five different teams.Kohli’s record in high-pressure scenarios further underlined his stature. In bilateral ODI series deciders, he has scored 784 runs at an average of 52.26, while in 300-plus chases, his tally stands at 2,131 runs with 10 centuries.",Virat Kohli scores 124 as India lose ODI series 2-1 to New Zealand.

Graeme Smith opens up on transition in Indian cricket, T20 World Cup and more

Poll Do you think the ICC will successfully secure all visas for Pakistani-origin players in time for the T20 World Cup? Yes, absolutely! No, there will be delays.

NEW DELHI: The International Cricket Council (ICC) remains confident that Indian visas for all players, support staff and officials of Pakistani origin or nationality involved in the upcoming T20 World Cup will be arranged in time.The assurance from the global governing body comes amid heightened scrutiny over visa clearances following recent delays faced by a few players. While visas for England’s Rehan Ahmed and Adil Rashid have now been issued, the ICC has underlined that their cases are part of a wider pool of applications and that the overall process is firmly on track, according to an ESPNcricinfo report.As per the report, there are as many as 42 applications spanning multiple teams participating in the tournament, including Canada, the Netherlands, the UAE, England, Italy, Bangladesh and the USA. The list includes not just players but also members of support staff and officials.Visa delays for individuals of Pakistani origin have been a recurring issue in recent years, largely due to strained political and diplomatic relations between India and Pakistan.The matter resurfaced prominently last week after USA fast bowler Ali Khan claimed on social media that he had been denied an Indian visa.The ICC, however, has adopted a more hands-on approach this time. It is understood to be in constant communication with Indian High Commissions and Consulates across several countries to ensure applications are handled smoothly and without unnecessary hold-ups. Visas have already been issued to players and officials from the Netherlands and Canada, the report further added.Meanwhile, visa appointments for members of the UAE, USA, Italy, Bangladesh and Canada squads are scheduled to take place early next week. The ICC believes these appointments will pave the way for the remaining approvals to be completed within the stipulated timeframe.The governing body is confident that all outstanding visas will be issued by January 31. With the first matches of the T20 World Cup scheduled for February 7, the ICC maintains that there is sufficient time to resolve any remaining formalities.","ICC remains confident that Indian visas for all players, support staff and officials of Pakistani origin or nationality involved in the upcoming T20 World Cup will be arranged in time.

"Tata Mumbai Marathon: Record 65,000 runners turn city roads into running track",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/tata-mumbai-marathon-record-65000-runners-turn-city-roads-into-running-track/articleshow/126667677.cms,"





MUMBAI: On Sunday, Mumbai finally found a reason to trade its infamous traffic jams for human ones, over 65,000 pairs of feet — most in trainers, some on wheelchairs and a few bare — reclaimed the roads for the 21st edition of the Tata Mumbai Marathon (TMM). The rhythmic thrum of the participants turned the city’s streets into a record-breaking sea of sweat and ambition.This 2026 edition eclipsed all previous figures with a staggering number of participants, benefiting from a comfortable 21°C morning, and the historic addition of the Mumbai Coastal Road to the course. In 2025, the total ground runners’ turnout was 59,967.This year also saw a peak in the premiere categories, with the full marathon field growing to 14,155 runners compared to 12,167 in 2025 and approximately 11,000 in 2024. The open 10km category introduced at TMM in 2018 saw 8,729 participants.The event also showcased a remarkable spectrum of age and dedication, ranging from its youngest participants —12year-olds Devansh Kamble, Yugandhara Todkar, Shubham Balkhande, and Trisha Krishnatry — to its oldest, 94year-old Arvind A Desai in the Senior Citizens’ Run.For some, the day was a milestone of longevity. Shajan Samuel completed his 300th half marathon, walking the entire distance.“Finished my 300th half marathon exactly at the same time I finished my first half marathon,” he shared. Others, like 64-year-old Sudhir Gosar ran for their health. Completing his 10th half marathon, the retiree from Mulund noted, “The planning and facilities were better compared to last year. The clear skies and the gentle winter breeze were just perfect for running...”Anay Shrikar (27), who marked his debut, running his first-ever full marathon, observed, “The incline, even though gradual, was very palpable... while returning, it was definitely one of the harder parts.” He added that “the wind was actually refreshing on the coastal Road, especially on the return leg.” Anil Khandelwal (66), who completed his second 42km run in 3 hours 50 minutes echoed: “The coastal road had more elevations so it was a tad difficult or I would have finished sooner, but the weather was excellent. ” For Bengaluru-based marketing professional Komal (39), who completed the half marathon, the new stretch offered a different vibe, “The coastal road was a beautiful and peaceful section... much quieter and darker than the sea link, which she found enjoyable.”Pune resident Sahil Shah (34) has done eight full marathons; this was his fourth at TMM. “I am expecting my second child next month and my daughter is six years old. Today’s run was dedicated to all new fathers and working professionals...While I enjoyed the run and the weather was also lovely I did feel a little fatigued at the Peddar Road climb however, the cheers from the crowd and a refreshing can of coke helped me sail through. ”Actor Saiyami Kher who successfully completed her second Ironman 70.3 triathlon, held on July 6, 2025, in Jönköping in Sweden, also finished a decade in the city’s marathon. Running a full marathon, Kher praised the organisation and cheering crowds, but hoped that pollution levels would recede significantly for a better running experience.Zerodha founder Nithin Kamath proudly shared on his social media handle that his wife Seema ran the 10km in 57 minutes, about two and a half years after surviving cancer.While the coastal road was quiet, the rest of the city roared with support. Few from the 42km and 21km events reported a shortage of cooling and hydration stations along the coastal road, leaving many participants dehydrated.Laurenzo Moodley (45) a South African ultra-marathoner, praised the warmth of the people in his “motherland”, the organisation and described the finisher medals as some of the best he has seen. He did offer a few critiques for improvement, suggesting “splitting the events across two days (eg the 10km and 21km on Saturday and the 42km on Sunday) to reduce the ‘chaos’ of having everyone on the course at once.” He also noted that the race is not very “spectator-friendly”, pointing out that “in South Africa, there are stands for the final 2km, whereas in Mumbai, it was difficult for his cousin to find him at the finish line”.Whether it was Katelyn Quiñones, from Texas, USA, shaving 13 minutes off her previous time or Georg Stephan Dirk from Germany enjoying the new perspective of the sea breeze, the 21st edition proved that the city’s pulse beats strongest on marathon Sunday. Runners from Belgium, Scotland, Japan, Portugal, Brazil, Australia and England made the journey to Mumbai for the marathon.","Over 65,000 runners took part in the 21st edition of the Tata Mumbai Marathon (TMM) The 2026 edition eclipsed all previous figures with a staggering number of participants.

For these teams, visa appointments have already been scheduled for early next week, suggesting the process is entering its final phase.

Why Mitch Marner feels less pressure in the Vegas Golden Knights than he ever did in the Toronto Maple Leafs

Mitch Marner Finds Pavel Dorofeyev With One-Touch Pass For Power-Play Goal

Mitch Marner's first game againts Toronto Maple Leafs in a Las Vegas Golden Knights jersey was packed with feelings, though he was not the only one who wanted to see his name on the scoresheet more. He ended the game with two assists during a power play in a 6–5 overtime victory, and both assists were during the power play. He was even booed by the Toronto fans present in the arena, which was a very peculiar situation to witness on the ice in the city of blessings, and it seemed as if it was a reminder of everything that had been left behind by Marner.One of the things that really came out was that he had none of the hero’s burden. Jack Eichel netted the winner in overtime and had four points in total. Pavel Dorofeyev scored twice, Tomas Hertl got two points, and Mark Stone had one goal and two assists, which made his point streak reach 10 games. Marner was part of the game; however, he was not the one to bring the night noise as he was in Toronto.In Toronto, there was pressure on Marner all the time. After defeats or playoff exits, the questions almost always returned to his production and his contract.That pressure does not exist in Vegas. Marner is currently the Golden Knights’ highest-paid player, yet he is not the only star on the team, and that depth acts like a barrier.Through the participation in 46 matches, Marner is the sixth-best goal scorer of the team with 5 goals. That kind of stat line would’ve caused an uproar in Toronto, especially after signing a massive long-term deal. In Vegas, it hardly registers since the team keeps winning. In fact, Marner was held pointless and finished minus-1 against San Jose last week, and the Golden Knights still won 7–2.Mitch Marner's situation offers a parallel to Phil Kessel's move from Toronto to Pittsburgh; however, the new, reduced role provided greater team success and personal satisfaction. Marner has mainly contributed to the team while being on the power play, where his superior vision has also brought others success. By his standards, it's been a good, not great season, but on this roster, that is more than enough.Marner no longer has to bear the burden of being the franchise's face. He may find the sharing of the spotlight in Vegas to be just what he needs to rediscover his joy in playing and winning, too.Also Read: Trevor Zegras Net Worth Timeline (2016–2026): From career growth to salary, endorsements, and more","Mitch Marner's first game againts Toronto Maple Leafs in a Las Vegas Golden Knights jersey was packed with feelings.

Allen Iverson’s ultimate financial safety net

The divorce settlement bifurcated Iverson’s trust fund



What is Allen Iverson doing now?



In the high-stakes world of NBA contracts, there are flashy max deals, and then there is the absolute masterclass in foresight known as the Allen Iverson Life Line. While he was busy breaking ankles and redefining league culture in the early 2000s, Allen Iverson’s team was quietly securing a financial legacy that would outlast his playing years by decades.It is one of the most legendary financial savings stories in sports history, and as Iverson, but as he inches closer to his mid-50s, it turns out he’s about to execute the greatest fast-break in the history of sports business: a $32 million trust fund courtesy of Reebok.Back in 2001, when Iverson was at his peak with the 2000-01 MVP award, he wrote history as the shortest player (6’0”) ever to win it. The same year, he also signed the ultimate financial safety net with Reebok. Taking into consideration his reputation as a lavish spender, Iverson’s agent and Reebok structured this unique lifetime contract that would support him in his post-league life.The deal included a yearly stipend in which Reebok will pay Iverson $800,000 every year for life. A lump sum trust fund of $32 million was set aside, but Iverson couldn’t touch it until he turned 55 years old. This year, on June 7th, Iverson will turn 51, and after 4 more years, in 2030, he can finally access this money.In a game of fate, Iverson lost his entire trust fund to his wife, Tawana Turner, after violating their postnuptial agreement. But Turner, instead of taking the entire check, decided to leave 50% with Iverson that saved him from financial ruin. When the fund finally matures in 2030, Iverson will likely walk away with $16 million, while the other $16 million goes to his ex-wife.Iverson’s career and life have given him some hard lessons about money. When his financial struggles hit the headlines, the world was shocked because this was the man who once ruled the NBA.In an interview in 2025, AI sat down and talked about how popularity and money had people circling him at one point, but with depleting finances, the circle became smaller and smaller.He said, “Just because you love somebody don't mean they love you the same way,"" he said. ""I made so many mistakes trusting people that you think supposed to love you. I'm not talking about friends that you grew up with … I'm talking about even family. Money is really the root of all evil.""In late 2023, Allen Iverson was appointed as the vice president of basketball in Reebok with Shaquille O’Neal as its president. This move wasn't just ceremonial, it brought Iverson back into the fold to help relaunch the brand's basketball category for the 2025-2026 season. He also published a memoir in 2025, Misunderstood, that dived deep into his upbringing, childhood, basketball, and becoming a cultural icon.Also read: The 21-year old Anthony Black announced himself to Europe with a poster dunk in Berlin","Allen Iverson signed a lifetime contract with Reebok in 2001.

Thackerays lose control of BMC: What's next for Uddhav and his Sena,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/thackerays-lose-control-of-bmc-whats-next-for-uddhav-and-his-sena/articleshow/126584774.cms,"Mumbai And Pune Verdict Shake Thackeray And Pawar Dynasties As Legacy Politics Faces Reality Check

NEW DELHI: The last bastion of the Thackerays has been breached. The BJP-led Mahayuti has ended the decades-old dominance of the Thackerays in the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). Even the “Brhamastra” of reunion, of cousins Uddhav and Raj. failed to help them retain control of the cash-rich civic body.For Uddhav Thackeray , this was a do-or-die electoral battle. After losing his government, his party, his symbol, it was important for Uddhav not to lose control over the BMC. While Uddhav’s Shiv Sena UBT did put up a strong fight, in the end it was not enough. On the other hand, Raj Thackeray ’s MNS, which has failed to make any significant electoral impact in the state since it was formed, failed yet again. As the results show, there were few takers for Raj Thackeray’s extreme anti-Marathi aggression.So, where do the Thackerays go from here? Will the Thackeray cousins continue with their alliance for future elections in the state? Or will Uddhav chart his own path once again?After the assembly elections in 2019, Uddhav had parted ways with his long-time ally - the BJP and joined hands with Sharad Pawar’s NCP and the Congress to form the MVA government in the state. However, his government could last only for around two and a half years. A revolt in the party by Eknath Shinde saw Uddhav lose his government, party and even the bow and arrow symbol.Uddhav’s decision to join hands with the Congress was a bold political decision given his father Bal Thackeray’s very strong views against the grand-old party. The BJP and the Shinde Sena have used Uddhav’s Congress association to not just corner him but also question his Hindutva commitment.Ahead of the BMC elections , Uddhav once again changed tracks - this time choosing his estranged cousin Raj Thackeray over the Congress for the make or break civic polls. The much-hyped reunion of the cousins became the talking point during the civic elections. Together they raised the Marathi Manoos pitch with aggression. However, in the end it was not enough to secure them a victory.What is also a worry for Uddhav Thackeray is the encouraging performance of Shinde’s Shiv Sena. Eknath Shinde has made impressive gains since he broke ranks with Uddhav. He has proved, election after election, that his Shiv Sena has wider acceptance in Maharashtra compared to the Uddhav Sena. With the BJP firmly behind him as of now, Shinde is the biggest threat to Uddhav’s party and his future politics.Uddhav Thackeray has not only lost electoral battles but also the perception battle of being the real Shiv Sena. He desperately needs to reclaim the political space in Maharashtra which he has lost to Shinde Sena in the last few years.While Uddhav’s party had made it clear that it will return to MVA fold for the assembly elections, it will be interesting to see the future course of action that Uddhav and his MVA allies actually take.The Congress has made it clear that it will not be part of any coalition that has Raj Thackeray, given the hard anti-outsider stand of the MNS chief. The Congress, which contested the civic polls without its MVA allies, would be hopeful, if not happy, with the results. It is unlikely that the grand-old party will change its stand vis-a-vis Raj Thackeray. Which means that Uddhav will have to decide between the Congress and the MNS.","The BJP-led Mahayuti has ended the decades-old dominance of the Thackerays in the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation.

From Olympic gold to global business icon, Anthony Joshua's financial journey



Anthony Joshua has turned his boxing success into a legacy. From Olympic hero to global superstar, his rise over the past decade has been steady and powerful. Now, the British star is not only known for knockouts. He is also known for smart contracts, big-brand deals, and careful business moves. His net worth growth reflects consistency at the top level of sport.As of now, Anthony Joshua’s estimated net worth stands at around $150 million (per celebrity net worth). Some reports suggest it could rise closer to $200 million after his recent mega fights. His paycheques come from huge fight purses, global endorsements, and business investments. Joshua is now one of the richest boxers in the world.Anthony Joshua’s big payday journey began after his gold medal win at the 2012 London Olympics. By 2016, his professional career was booming. He won world titles and quickly became a box office star. His early title fights earned him millions and pushed his net worth into the tens of millions.The defining moment came in April 2017. Joshua defeated Wladimir Klitschko at Wembley Stadium.The fight made him a global name. It also delivered one of his first massive paydays. From that point, Joshua became a stadium fighter who could sell out any venue.Between 2017 and 2018, Joshua defended his titles against Carlos Takam, Joseph Parker, and Alexander Povetkin. Each fight brought eight-figure earnings. Sponsors followed. Brands like Under Armour, Beats by Dre, and Hugo Boss signed major deals with him.

"Nikola Jokić caught doing something no one expected in the locker room, shared by an NBA insider",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/nikola-joki-caught-doing-something-no-one-expected-in-the-locker-room-shared-by-an-nba-insider/articleshow/126591941.cms,"(Image via Facebook / @Nikola Jokić)

The locker-room video that instantly went viral after Shams shared it

Why Nikola Jokić and the Quesarito have been linked for over a decade

Some NBA storylines take years to make sense and this one is a classic example of that. Nikola Jokić finally eating a Quesarito is apparently one of them. A locker-room video shared by Shams Charania has sent NBA fans into disbelief after showing the Nuggets star casually eating the infamous Taco Bell item that has followed him since draft night. What started as a long-running internet joke has now turned into a real, viral moment and the NBA internet is having a field day with it.In the clip circulated by Shams, Jokić is seen in the locker room calmly eating a Quesarito, showing no concern for the cultural earthquake it was about to cause online. No announcement. No dramatic reveal. Just Jokić, food in hand, doing what fans were convinced he would never do.Within minutes of being shared, the video spread online with fans reacting as if a major NBA mystery had finally been solved.To understand why this moment matters, you have to go back to the 2014 NBA Draft. Jokić was selected during a Taco Bell commercial promoting the Quesarito, a coincidence that became legendary once he turned into a two-time MVP and one of the best players in the league.Over the years, Jokić has openly said he never ate Taco Bell which only strengthened the myth. The Quesarito became shorthand for one of the strangest draft-night moments in NBA history, and fans treated the idea of Jokić actually eating one as something that would never happen.Until now.The fact that Shams Charania shared this, makes it even more fun. NBA fans are used to Shams breaking news about trades, injuries, and signings not locker-room food moments. That contrast is exactly why the internet ran with it.Part of why this resonated so strongly is because it fits Jokić perfectly. He has always been known for being low-key, uninterested in hype and unintentionally hilarious without trying to be.Seeing him finally eat the Quesarito felt like the closing chapter of an inside joke the NBA has shared for more than a decade.Also read - Ja Morant and Vince Williams Jr. seen arguing during Grizzlies Germany practice — what’s behind it?",Nikola Jokić has been linked with the Quesarito for over a decade.

India Open: World No.1 An Se-young dominates to claim women’s title; Lin Chun Yi wins men’s crown,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/badminton/india-open-world-no-1-an-se-young-dominates-to-claim-womens-title-lin-chun-yi-wins-mens-crown/articleshow/126668699.cms,"An Se Young of Korea (ANI Photo)

Jay Shah’s 2036 Olympic blueprint for India: '8 Medals won’t cut it'

NEW DELHI: An Se-young walked into the Indira Gandhi Indoor Stadium as world No. 1. She walked out, having once again underlined why the gap between her and the rest of the women’s singles field is growing by the week.A final that promised a battle between the top two players in the world turned into a masterclass in control, precision and authority. Against China’s world No. 2 Wang Zhi Yi, the South Korean was not just better, she was operating on a different plane altogether. This was not a one-off performance. It was a continuation of a trend.Over the last year or so, An has begun to dominate women’s singles in a manner rarely seen in modern badminton. Opponents no longer look for ways to beat her; they look for ways to survive her. In Delhi, she didn’t merely win the India Open Super 750. She owned it.The men’s singles title was won by Chinese Taipei’s Lin Chun Yi, who defeated Indonesia’s Jonatan Christie 21-10, 21-18. Lin, who arrived in India carrying a muscle strain from the Malaysia Open, produced a fearless attacking display, using his lefthanded angles and pace to keep Jonatan under pressure throughout.China’s top seeds Liu Sheng Shu and Tan Ning won the women’s doubles title, Thailand’s Dechapol Puavaranukroh and Supissara Paewsampran clinched the mixed doubles crown, while China’s Liang Wei Keng and Wang Chang emerged champions in men’s doubles.The stands on Sunday were dotted with school children, many of them chanting loudly for the Korean star. “An Se-young! An Se-young!” rang out across the hall, along with excited cries of “Korea, Korea!” and “Kya khel rahi hai!” as rallies repeatedly ended on her terms.The defending champion needed just 43 minutes to dismantle Wang 21-13, 21-11 and claim her second title of the season, following last week’s Malaysia Open Super 1000 crown — also at Wang’s expense.From the opening exchanges, An looked in complete command. She glided across the court, taking the shuttle early, stretching Wang into uncomfortable corners and constantly pushing her onto the back foot. She surged to a 7-1 lead in the opening game and soon made it 15-9. Wang briefly closed the gap to 13-15, but An simply shifted gears, rattling off six straight points to seal the game with ruthless efficiency.The second game followed a similar pattern. An built a steady 11-7 advantage, never appearing rushed or unsettled. An’s calm authority ensured there was no late twist, as she wrapped up the contest with ease. “I’m really glad I won. The last two weeks have been very tiring, but I’m a winner and I’m very happy,” An said, while acknowledging the sizeable crowd. She attributed her sustained success to an attacking mindset. “Every player tries their best to beat me, and I also try my best not to lose. I focus on attacking and giving my best.”","An Se-young beats China's Wang Zhi Yi to win India Open Super 750 title. Defending champion An needed just 43 minutes to dismantle Wang 21-13, 21-11.
