Brandon Aiyuk could be the star Patrick Mahomes needs

Patrick Mahomes has been waiting for a big-play receiver





The Kansas City Chiefs might be planning something big before the 2025 NFL season begins. On June 16, 2025, reports started coming out that the team could go after San Francisco 49ers wide receiver Brandon Aiyuk. He’s looking for a long-term deal, possibly worth $23 million per year. Such a move could potentially create a lot of avenues for the Kansas City Chiefs' offense and give quarterback Patrick Mahomes another powerful weapon. Nothing is done yet, but each day is bringing this closer. Fans are enjoying what will emerge next.Brandon Aiyuk, 26, was a big part of the San Francisco 49ers' offense, compiling a 2023 season where he notched 75 catches, 1,342 yards, and 7 touchdowns in his statistically best season as a professional. Brandon Aiyuk is fast, trustworthy, and consistently finds ways to beat defenders — in other words, he's the type of option Patrick Mahomes could use more of. The Kansas City Chiefs have not had a true top wide receiver since Tyreek Hill left town.On June 16, 2025, Brandon Aiyuk posted a short video on TikTok saying, “They don’t want me back,” referring to the 49ers. That same day, ESPN’s Adam Schefter said on NFL Live, “If Brandon Aiyuk is truly available, the Chiefs will absolutely be in the mix.”Brandon Aiyuk is in the final year of his rookie contract, with a $14 million option. He wants a raise — close to $23 million a year. If the Kansas City Chiefs want to help Patrick Mahomes even more, this could be their chance. According to The Athletic, the team still has around $25 million in cap space. That gives them enough room to make the deal work if they want to.This offseason, Patrick Mahomes has been training in Missouri with a young group of wide receivers. Most of them are still learning, and while they’ve shown potential, none of them have the star power that Brandon Aiyuk brings.A player like Brandon Aiyuk could alleviate pressure on Patrick Mahomes, and make the Kansas City Chiefs’ offense much more dynamic. Training camp will start towards the end of July 2025. If a deal ever occurs before that, the team could go into the season with a brand new weapon ready to go.Also Read: San Francisco 49ers GM John Lynch Breaks Silence On Brandon Aiyuk’s Return After ACL And MCL Tear Against Kansas City Chiefs","Brandon Aiyuk, 26, was a big part of the San Francisco 49ers' offense, compiling a 2023 season where he notched 75 catches, 1,342 yards, and 7 touchdowns.

NHL Trade rumor: Mitch Marner’s Toronto Maple Leafs teammates believe NHL star will sign with Western Conference team soon,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/mitch-marners-toronto-maple-leafs-teammates-believe-nhl-star-will-sign-with-western-conference-team-soon/articleshow/121888831.cms,"Mitch Marner meets the media of Toronto maybe for the last time (Credit: Getty Image)

Why Toronto Maple Leafs star Mitch Marner needs a clean NHL break



A Blizzard of Goals Puts Florida a Win Away From Glory | 32 Thoughts

Top NHL teams in the Western Conference could pursue Mitch Marner







The NHL offseason buzz is centered on Toronto Maple Leafs forward Mitch Marner, and his teammates may have already revealed the biggest clue. Several Leafs players reportedly believe Marner’s next destination lies out West, away from the pressure cooker of Toronto and the emotional ties to the Eastern Conference.As NHL insider Elliotte Friedman recently shared, the belief in the Leafs locker room is that Marner wants a full reset, and a Western Conference team would offer just that. While the Carolina Hurricanes have shown interest, Friedman downplayed their chances, pointing instead to a desire for a clean break and long-term distance from his current team.Since entering the league, Mitch Marner has carried both the hopes and frustrations of Toronto Maple Leafs fans. Postseason disappointments and salary cap debates have often overshadowed a skilled playmaker and top-line winger, Marner’s regular-season consistency.The attention and pressure from the Canadian hockey market have seemingly taken a toll. After years of scrutiny, Marner is now believed to be craving something the Leafs can no longer provide, freedom from expectations.As trade talks heat up, several NHL teams in the Western Conference are emerging as potential fits for Mitch Marner.Though no official suitors have been named, teams like the Los Angeles Kings, Vegas Golden Knights, and Seattle Kraken have cap space and a desire to bolster their top-six forward groups.Early offseason chatter linked Marner to the Boston Bruins and Florida Panthers, but remaining in the Atlantic Division now appears unlikely. Facing the Maple Leafs multiple times each season while still in the Eastern spotlight runs counter to Marner’s apparent desire to fade from that narrative.Read more: Trade news: Blackhawks send Victor Söderström to Bruins for Ryan Mast and a draft pick According to teammate insight and league reports, this is about more than hockey. Mitch Marner wants control over his next chapter, and that next chapter seems destined to begin far from Toronto, in the quieter lanes of the NHL’s Western frontier. Don’t be surprised if talks stretch deep into the summer. Marner’s $10.9 million cap hit means any deal will require strategic balancing from both sides.In the meantime, fan opinion remains divided. Some still believe Marner deserves more time, while others see his exit as a necessary evolution for the franchise. Mitch Marner’s future with the Maple Leafs seems increasingly uncertain as trade rumors intensify. A move to the Western Conference could offer the reset he’s reportedly seeking. With emotional fatigue setting in and pressure mounting, Marner’s next chapter may unfold far from Toronto’s spotlight.","Toronto Maple Leafs forward Mitch Marner is reportedly looking for a clean break.

Josh Allen breaks silence on controversial Tush Push after NFL rule talks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/josh-allen-breaks-silence-on-controversial-tush-push-after-nfl-rule-talks/articleshow/121916060.cms,"Josh Allen breaks silence on controversial Tush Push after NFL rule talks (Image via Getty)

Josh Allen shares his thoughts about the Tush Push ban during a sports interview

Josh Allen’s comments add more heat to the debate in the 2025 NFL season





The Tush Push play has become one of the most talked-about moves in the NFL. It gained fame through the Philadelphia Eagles, who used it with great success. Other teams, including the Buffalo Bills, have also tried it. Not everyone, however, concurs on whether it should still be in the game. Some coaches believe it is too dangerous. One team even voted to ban it. But now, quarterback Josh Allen has spoken out with a clear opinion—and it might surprise fans of the Buffalo Bills.In a new interview with Sports Illustrated published on June 14, 2025, Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen spoke about the ongoing debate over the Tush Push. The talk happened after the NFL meeting in May 2025, where teams voted on whether to ban the play. The Buffalo Bills voted yes to ban it. Head coach Sean McDermott said it was risky and could lead to injuries.But Josh Allen had a different view. He told Sports Illustrated, “If you can’t stop it, keep running it.” He said that only a few teams, like the Philadelphia Eagles, do the play really well because they practice often and have the right players for it.Josh Allen also added, “Just because some teams do it better doesn’t mean others can’t try.If you don’t like it, my advice is to stop it.” He said he would follow any rule changes, but for now, if it’s allowed, teams should be free to use it.The Buffalo Bills used the Tush Push last season during important games. They tried it in the AFC Championship game against the Kansas City Chiefs. But it didn’t work well then—the Kansas City Chiefs stopped it. That loss may be one reason why coach McDermott supported banning the play this offseason.Still, Josh Allen seems open to using it again in the 2025 season if it stays legal. His words gave fans and experts something to talk about, especially since his coach feels the opposite.For now, the Tush Push remains part of the game, and Josh Allen seems ready to keep pushing forward—literally.Also Read: ""I would absolutely love to"": Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen willing to lead Team USA in 2028 flag football debut","Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen spoke out about the Tush Push in an interview with Sports Illustrated.

Shaunie Henderson does a cover-up on her family tattoo





Tattoos are personal for most people. Some let a patchwork stay on their body for the rest of their lives, while some evolve and change the designs on their body according to the changes in their lives. And looks like NBA legend Shaquille O'Neal's ex-wife, Shaunie Henderson, belongs to the second group of people, as she was recently seen changing a piece of ink on her body that once meant the world to her. Is it her way of letting the past go or something else? Let's find out.Shaquille O'Neal and Shaunie Henderson got married back in 2002, and share four children - Shareef, Amirah, Shaqir, and Me’arah. Shaq also has a daughter from a previous relationship and adopted Shaunie's son Myles from hers. They had it all, and their love was evident in the way they stood by each other. But like all good things, this came to an end when Shaunie filed for divorce in 2009.Before things took a turn though, Shaq and his wife both got tattoos to commemorate their family. Shaq got the names of his ex-wife Shaunie, and two of their sons—Myles and Shareef, tattooed on his right wrist, and the names of his daughters—Taahirah, Amirah, and Me’Arah, tattooed on his left wrist.Shaunie, too, had a beautiful tattoo on her back - a butterfly sitting on a flower, where the petals had the names of all her children written in them.And while Shaq and Shaunie maintain a very amicable relationship as co-parents, looks like the latter is ready to move on from the past a little bit. She got married to Pastor Keion Henderson in May 2022 and now, recently, was seen doing a cover-up ink on the butterfly tattoo on her back. The previous design is gone, and in its place, there is a vibrant and colorful floral piece.Shaunie is still a very dedicated mother to all her children, which is pretty evident with how much time she spends with them, but what does the cover-up mean? Maybe it's just her way of bringing a new change into something old. After all, a tattoo is not proof of how much she loves all her kids.Also Read: “People will always talk”- NBA legend Shaquille O’Neal speaks out after wild gossip","Shaunie Henderson got married to Shaquille O'Neal back in 2002.

""Durant is on an expiring $54.7 million deal for 2025-26, and the Suns have made clear to six-to-eight seriously interested teams that they will make the best deal for the franchise – even outside of his preferred list of Miami, San Antonio and Houston.""





Kevin Durant has multiple trade options this summer. From the San Antonio Spurs making a buzz to even rumors of the Golden State Warriors knocking at his door, the NBA veteran could go anywhere. But the real question is - Will it be for the right reasons? While it is almost a done deal that he will be leaving the Phoenix Suns during the off-season, where he ends up landing is the main thing everyone wants to know. And with multiple sources saying that quite a few top teams are vying for his talents, the 36-year-old also has other things to consider.From the San Antonio Spurs to the Miami Heat to the Houston Rockets, Kevin Durant is keeping quite a few options at hand as the offseason window inches closer. He will be leaving the Phoenix Suns at the end of it, but where he ends up going is still up in the air. But according to NBA sources, chances of him landing with the Rockets or the Heats are much higher than that of the Spurs, who are also gunning for some top draft options this summer.According to Shams Charania of ESPN, while Durant has made his choices clear, whether his preferred destinations will match with what the Suns are looking for in their perfect business deal is not equated to the same.Durant apparently wanted to make a move to Houston or Miami back in February, and everyone thought that he could be transitioned into a new team, but nothing panned out, and he stayed with the Suns. Where he ends up now, once the off-season window opens, is what fans will be looking to see, as the playoff season inches closer with each day.

Andrew McCutchen exposes MLB’s new baseballs as reason for Aaron Judge ’s power drop





Yankees power hitters like Aaron Judge can be affected





The New York Yankees are going through a rough patch with their recent losing streak. While many fans are pointing fingers at the team’s performance, one baseball veteran has shared something even more surprising. His words are now making headlines. The truth may have less to do with how players are swinging and more to do with what they are swinging at. The problem could be in the baseballs themselves.Former New York Yankees outfielder Andrew McCutchen discussed on June 15, 2025 a major baseball shift few fans were aware of. He made this public in a video interview, saying that an MLB official told him the balls this season are not the same as previously.McCutchen said, “They told me the seams are higher this year. ” Higher ball seams, he said, can slow it down in flight. This implies that the ball does not travel as far when a player hits it as it used to. “Every baseball is hand-sewn; so no ball is same,” he continued.When McCutchen asked the MLB if they could fix the issue during the 2025 season, they said no. The league is still looking into it but won’t make changes right now.This comes at a time when teams like the Yankees depend on strong batters to hit home runs and score runs.Known for their potent hitters Aaron Judge and Giancarlo Stanton, the Yankees are having trouble scoring.

Some believe it’s unfair to teams built around power hitting.If what McCutchen says is true, the Yankees might need to change their game plan. Until the MLB fixes or confirms the issue, teams and fans will be watching closely.","Former New York Yankees outfielder Andrew McCutchen discussed on June 15, 2025 a major baseball shift few fans were aware of.

Acceptance of a name that would define a legacy

Panthers Win Game 5 to Take 3-2 Lead in Stanley Cup Final | NHL on TNT





Wayne Gretzky is a name synonymous with greatness in the NHL , but the origin of his famous nickname, ""The Great One,"" has a surprising twist. During a recent segment on NHL on TNT’s Face Off, Gretzky shared that his father, Walter Gretzky, was not a fan of the moniker when it first appeared during his youth hockey days.Long before Wayne Gretzky shattered NHL records, he was just a ten-year-old prodigy from Brantford, Ontario, netting an unbelievable 400 goals in a single season. A reporter from the London Free Press came to profile the young phenom. At the conclusion of the article, the journalist proposed a fitting nickname: “The Great One,” drawing inspiration from legends like “Mr. Hockey” and “The Golden Jet.”“They said, ‘We should just call him The Great One,’” Gretzky recalled. “Well, my dad tried to kill that right away — it just kept coming back.”Walter Gretzky believed such a title placed unnecessary pressure on his young son. He didn’t want Wayne to bear the weight of premature hype. But despite his father's objections, the nickname gained traction and became permanently linked to the budding superstar.Over time, the family had no choice but to embrace the label. “Finally, I just was like, ‘Well, we’re going to have to live with it,’” Gretzky admitted.And live with it he did. By the time he retired in 1999, Gretzky had not only fulfilled but exceeded the expectations that came with such a grand title. With 894 goals, 2,857 career points, and 61 NHL records, “The Great One” wasn’t just a nickname—it became his rightful legacy.Switching gears to current NHL action, Gretzky also shared his thoughts on the Edmonton Oilers' Game 5 loss to the Florida Panthers. “Right from the get-go, Florida played a really smart, intelligent road game,” he said, noting that Edmonton looked “cautious” and “on their heels” early on.Also Read: No longer Canadian: Wayne Gretzky’s Canadian identity questioned after Donald Trump friendship sparks controversy From a childhood nickname to a storied NHL career, Gretzky’s story remains one of humility, brilliance, and enduring greatness.","Wayne Gretzky's famous nickname, ""The Great One,"" originated from a profile of his youth hockey dominance.

Kuldeep Yadav hints at spin-friendly wicket ahead of England Test series

NEW DELHI: Former England spinner Graeme Swann has stirred up controversy ahead of the much-anticipated five-Test series between India and England, calling the clash a “perfect warm-up for the Ashes.”His comments, which were meant to galvanise Ben Stokes’s side, have instead drawn widespread criticism from fans and pundits who see them as a disrespectful downplay of India’s stature in world cricket.Set to begin on June 20 at Headingley, the series marks England’s return to Test action after a lacklustre World Test Championship campaign.Swann suggested the home series could serve as a confidence builder for England before their trip Down Under later this year.However, critics argue that treating a heavyweight encounter against India, ranked among the top Test sides, as mere preparation for the Ashes reflects a narrow and outdated mindset.“It's kind of a perfect warm-up for the Ashes series. India is a huge series,” Swann told Sky Sports Cricket.""Last 2-3 times, we have gone to India, and we were thoroughly outplayed. So, in our own backyard, our home turf, we need to beat India.We need to play well.“They don't have Virat Kohli or Rohit Sharma, their two superstars with the bat. Yes, they've got great players coming up instead, but we've got bowlers who exploit our conditions well. England must look to win this series. I will take 4-1, 3-2 at best. I hope we do well and get the confidence moving into the Ashes.”Following these comments, Swann faced heavy backlash on social media.India, under Shubman Gill’s leadership, have arrived in Leeds with a potent mix of emerging and experienced players. Young pacer Harshit Rana has been added to the squad, further bolstering India’s pace attack. Having previously represented India A, Rana is expected to be a valuable asset on English pitches.The Indian team had a brief tune-up in the form of an intra-squad game against India A, offering key players like KL Rahul and Yashasvi Jaiswal some much-needed match practice.As the first Test approaches, Swann’s comments continue to spark debate.

NEW DELHI: Indian fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah revealed he declined the Test captaincy role before Shubman Gill 's appointment, citing workload management concerns for the upcoming five-match England series starting June 20 at Leeds. Despite being vice-captain and a frontrunner to replace Rohit Sharma , who stepped down in May, Bumrah chose to prioritise his bowling responsibilities over leadership duties.The decision came after discussions with the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) during the Indian Premier League regarding his availability for all Test matches.""Before Rohit [Sharma] & Virat [Kohli] retired - During the IPL, I had spoken to BCCI, that I have discussed workload going forward in a five-match Test series, [and that] I have spoken to people who manage my back.

First thoughts on the start of what is being called a new era for the Indian cricket team.

Poll Do you think India can win the Test series against England without Kohli, Rohit, and Ashwin? Yes, they have strong young talent No, they will struggle without experienced players

Kuldeep Yadav hints at spin-friendly wicket ahead of England Test series

Shubman Gill is the new India Test captain. A young captain who is still work-in-progress as far as Test batting is concerned. There will be high expectations. What do you make of this both for Gill and Team India?

You were doing commentary during the last India-England Test series, in India. It was again a very high-pressure series for Shubman who was in desperate need for runs. But he responded in emphatic fashion in that series and then gave a good account of his leadership for Gujarat Titans in the IPL - not an ideal start in his first season as captain but led the side well in the 2025 edition. Anything that stood out for you?

Will he be okay as a Test batter in English conditions too?

You just mentioned how it's difficult to leave on length in England. I interviewed former England captain Graham Gooch who said it has been a very dry summer. You reckon that will have a say on the pitches which will be dished out for the series? How much will overhead conditions affect that?

Good wickets would give some breathing space to this inexperienced Indian batting line-up? By inexperienced I mean players who haven't played a lot in this part of the world. So will these pitches be better than the green carpets which have been rolled out for Team India in the past?

I think England start as slight favourites. But I think it's going to be a crackerjack of a series Nick Knight

Over 200 First Class games. 40 Test hundreds... You definitely know more than a thing or two about batting in these conditions. But I will slightly take you towards the bowling bit because you touched upon England's bowling composition. What are your thoughts on India bowlers? And the situation which they could face somewhere in the series where Jasprit Bumrah will have to sit out to manage his workload. Will it have a big impact?

Gautam Gambhir sends stern message after Bengaluru tragedy

The last time you were doing commentary for an India-England series,

Ravichandran Ashwin

was still giving it a rip. Rohit Sharma was scoring a 100. Virat Kohli was part of the Test setup, but he was on a paternity leave due to the birth of his second child. Now, cut to present 2025, three stalwarts are gone from the setup. How do you see that from the standpoint of the series being built up? What kind of hype are you seeing?

'Cricketers Aren’t Cattle... ': Harish Thawani on the IPL and Business of Indian Cricket

Ahead of the first India-England Test in Leeds from June 20, TimesofIndia.com spoke to former England batter Nick Knight who explained why there is a lot of intrigue attached to the series in absence of stalwarts Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma and R Ashwin. The former cricketer further explained what Shubman Gill needs to do to find success as a batter in this part of the world, ideal bowling combinations, the likely conditions and a lot more. Edited Excerpts:Well, you're absolutely right. Obviously, now with no Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, there's a kind of different feel, different look to the side. I think it's hugely exciting. I think if just on that point, I think if ever a time where in recent past where India would cope with the loss of two such players, I think it's now. I'm very lucky. I work a lot in India and I get to see some of these young kids that are coming through.And boy, can they play and how exciting that they are. And when you transition from being sort of young, developing talent into international cricketer of note, you look at the developmental stage of where you're at. And some of these guys, Sai Sudharsan for me, is ready to play international cricket now.I mean, international Test match cricket. Some of these guys now, they're ready to move on. So I think the timing is good and I think it's going to be a fantastic series. Do I think England start as slight favourites, by the way? Yes, I do.I do. I think England start as slight favourites. But I think it's going to be a crackerjack of a series. Absolutely. You know, exciting brand of cricket.I mean, there are such expectations and probably more so in your great country and with cricket. And what you expect of your players and the level that you expect them to play day in, day out. Realistically, you're absolutely right. You know, he's learning the trade and it's going to be a tough tour for him. But the one thing I would say with Shubman is I think he'll be fine tactically. I think he'll be fine leading the side. I think he'll be fine as a captain. The one area which none of us know the answer to really. We'll all have our opinions on it. But none of us really know how he's going to cope with the expectation he puts on himself and dealing with his own time. Dealing with his own batting.Giving himself time to be the high class player he is. When you're captain of a side, all of a sudden you have not quite so much time to prepare for yourself. And a lot of his batting skills and his batting will have been because he's had time to think about himself. Develop his own game. Understand his own game. Go into the test match knowing exactly how he's going to play.All of a sudden he's got 10 or 11 other guys that he's got to worry about. That'll be a great challenge for him, I think. Can he kind of, with the help of the coach, can he kind of section off and still have time to concern himself with his own game? And how that's going to look in the most important moments. I don't know the answer to that. I'm not sure he does right now. But he'll find that out as he goes along in this test match series.I think that's going to be pretty crucial because every side, and England will do it. You can bet your bottom dollar, England will do it. No side is more vulnerable than when its captain is feeling a little under pressure and vulnerable. That has a huge impact on the whole dressing room, right? So England will target Shubman Gill. England will try and knock him over. England will try and make him feel uncomfortable.Because they'll feel that that might have a knock-on effect with those around him. So it's a huge series for Shugman Gill. Who, by the way, I am a huge fan of. And have been for a long, long time. I remember seeing Shubman at 18, 19 in an Under-19 World Cup in New Zealand. And I went, wow, this boy can play.The thing about test match cricket, and I've been lucky enough to play it over the years, the thing is that all the stuff you just mentioned there, it tests you. It tests your resilience. It tests your ability to come back. It's not all going to be plain sailing. There are going to be moments where you question yourself. There are going to be moments where everyone questions you.There are going to be moments where you go away and say, how can I do that better? And these are sort of natural thought processes that you go in. And your reference to Shubman there, he would have gone through that endless times and will do so more in the future. It's how you bounce back from that.I think his game is in good enough order to do that regularly. The one thing, technically, you want to just make sure that his front foot doesn't come too far across a little bit sometimes, so that he's playing at balls outside or stump. He doesn't have to. But that will be a major area, I think, where England will. And that's the same with every top order player. But I think someone like Shubman, they'll look at that.In England, the thing with England and being in the top order in English conditions, you can't leave the ball on length. When you play in the Southern Hemisphere, the likes of Australia, South Africa, you can leave that ball on length because the ball's going to be going over the stumps. Here in the UK, it's a little bit more tricky to do that.You can do it sometimes, but often you can't. And so you end up getting drawn into that ball on that off-stump line because you're not sure if it's going to go over the stumps or hit the top of off-stump. And that is where you have to be really, really in tune, your head on that top of off-stump line, nice and still, so your judgment is really good.I think that's where England will look to move it back in, a little bit to Shubman Gill as well, to try and hit those pads. So he's going to be tested technically, absolutely for sure. Is he up to it? Absolutely.Big, big tick. But it's that ability to be able to focus on his game, as well as being the pressures of all that goes with being an Indian Test match captain. I wish him well. I think he's the right man for the job, by the way. I really do. I know there are a number of other options. I think he's the right man for the job. And deep down, obviously, I hope England win the series. But I really hope Shubman Gill has a series to remember.Yeah, I mean, absolutely. The thing I'd add to that is, I mean, you know, Goochy (Gooch) played some great innings at Headingley. He knows conditions there for that first Test match. I mean, I've got a Test match 100 at Headingley. There's a bit of a myth there that Headingley is a green seamer that goes all over the place, that seamers just hit a length and it goes left, it goes right. It is a little bit of a myth. And that's your point that I'm going to lead to, is the weather conditions in the UK at the moment are very good. And I think it's set fair.I mean, I'm down south here in the UK, but I think up north in Headingley, I think it's still pretty set fair. So if that's the case, the pitch is going to be pretty good. I mean, I think we'll have good surfaces. However, you know, then there's still not southern hemisphere bounce. It's not like playing in Australia where you can see a length and you can lead. There are pitches in the UK where you can do that, oval perhaps more so than others.And there are pitches, but it's not quite so commonplace. And therefore, as a batter, when you go out there, you're more lining up your head-on-off stump and you're more lining up which to play and which to lead based on the fact that it's not going to go over the stumps unless it's really short. So there are just little things there that you have to be aware of when you're playing and trying to set yourself up to be successful in the UK. KL Rahul . I'll go there. KL Rahul did it quite brilliantly at Member of the Lord's last time round. I was there. I was working on that Test. I remember sitting around that amazing media centre and watching KL Rahul leave the ball quite brilliantly outside off stump.And that really, if you're looking at any area as to why he was successful on that day, in its simplest form, it was that.Yeah. I mean, we're making an assumption that we're going to have good wickets. I mean, I think that would be the case. I don't think England would want anything else but good wickets. I mean, the way they play the game, they're going to want the surface. So, if we're to assume that that's the case, absolutely. Yeah. I mean, the other point that I would allude to on the basis of what you've just said is that they've got two or three warm-up games. I mean, these things like warm-up games, it's almost irrelevant in the world game now.Touring is not – these things don't generally happen as much as they used to. So, you know, KL Rahul got 100 opening the batting in the last game. He's got a half century. You know, Jaiswal hasn't scored big runs. I think he's got a half century. But he's been out there in the middle, in a competitive environment.He's starting to formulate his ideas. He's starting to formulate plans of how he might go about his batting. Now, all these things have got relevance come, Headingley, June the 20th.So, I think you're right. I think if it's a good pitch – I mean, it's looking, obviously, slightly more inexperienced there with India's top order. They want a good pitch. Absolutely. They also – that English bowling line-up is looking a whole lot different to what it might have looked like. Let's be honest. You know, no Joffrey Archer. No Mark Wood . No Gus Atkinson. No Ollie Stone. You know, there are four pacers there. Three or four of them might have found themselves in a front-line 11.So, things are looking a little different for India's top order than perhaps they might have done. Yeah. Now, quite naturally, the conversation has evolved a lot around the batters because no one better to speak to you than you.I mean, there is no better bowler in the world right now. There is no more impactful bowler in the world. He (Bumrah) can change a game just like that. So, clearly, the obvious answer is yes. I think where you have to go with that is just try and work out what that bowling line-up is going to look like with and without him. Now, for me, I have got quite strong views on this. We all know how England want to play. They are aggressive.They will take you on. They are much more refined, by the way, than I think they were a couple of years ago with this whole approach. They will also sit in. I think they will be quite respectful of Bumrah when he comes on. I don't think they are going to try and pelt him back over his head for 4 and 6 every ball. So, I think they will be a bit more refined.They are more refined. So, really, what the question mark for India's bowling line-up is how can they take wickets regularly? How can they knock England back? Because that is the only way they are going to stop them from scoring quickly. They bat deep. They bat big. They bat strong. So, for me, I think they have got to be really clever here how they line up as a bowling unit.There is obviously going to be a temptation to play one of Nitish and Shardul. One is slightly stronger with the bat. One is slightly stronger with the ball. That is fine. But for me, whatever you do with your bowling line-up, it has to have an aggressive intent. It has to be thinking wickets. Don't worry too much about the runs. The runs are going to come against you anyway. So, I am not against Arshdeep playing, by the way. Because I just like the variation. I like the left armer. I like the fact that when you look at England, they keep going at bowlers.They keep going strong. What does Arshdeep do as a living, day in, day out? He tries to absorb batters coming at him in T20 cricket. He has got a good bowling craft, for me. He has got a good ability to outthink and think about what the batters are doing. I like that. I think that might hold true here in this series. So, I think he is an option. Prasidh Krishna , another one. Tall, bouncy bowler.There might be conditions where he might be pretty useful. So, Siraj and Bumrah is a given. I think England, I think India have got to play sometimes four frontline bowlers. It might be that they have to attack, attack, attack with four frontline bowlers.The danger sometimes with sides when you play in England is that you go, do you know what, we will try and lengthen that batting line up a little bit. We will play someone who is good at seven and eight and who might give us a bit of both. I think with this side against England, you have got to attack at all costs. So, go with your most likely wicket tapers with the ball. And if that means slightly extending your tail a little bit, then I am afraid that is going to have to be. Last point on this, Kuldeep.I think Kuldeep is a major player. I really do think he is a major player. I think he is a major player. And if this weather stays like this, for me, then take out one of your seamers, maybe play three and play Jadeja and Kuldeep. Because Kuldeep for me holds so much of a key against England. I think he is one of the bowlers. Bumrah obviously the other. I think Kuldeep would be another. England find it hard.If Kuldeep bowls well, England will find it hard to attack him. They want to attack. If they are not quite sure which way the ball is turning, Harry Brook and the like, they are going to find that whole lot harder than a seamer who is just bowling it up and down. I think Kuldeep plays a major role here. Yeah.Yeah, I think it's a good question. And I think the best answer I can give is there's a lot of intrigue. There's a lot of interest because some of the names are slightly different. And it's like, how is this group going to do? Because I can tell you back in the UK, there was a huge amount of interest in the IPL. I mean, huge amount of following, interest. And the guys that follow cricket in this country follow the IPL in many ways.And so they know these guys. They know Shubham and Gill inside out. They know Sai Sudharsan. They've seen them play in this great tournament. And so their question is the same as, I guess, many. It's like, well, how are they going to go in a Test Match series in England when they've not really played that much, some of these guys? You know, they're fresh behind the ears.They've not played that much Test Match cricket. There's no Kohli. So there's an intrigue level, I think, about just how this young Indian side, inexperienced Indian side in many ways is going to go. There's a slightly different feel about it. I think that's the best way I can describe it. But huge amount of interest, huge amount of just wanting to see how this is all going to play out. I mean, it is one of the great series. It really is. I hope the weather conditions stay fit and fine and well so that we can get a lot of cricket.Because the word I use, the catchphrase I use, as well as others, is entertainment. We're going to be provided with a huge amount of entertainment here. It's going to be jam-packed with entertainment. If India, just to finish off your question, if India can cope with no Rohit, no Ashwin, no Kohli, I think it's now. I think a couple of years ago, I don't think they would have coped as well. Because I think some of these guys that are coming in are now ready to take on the mantle.I think a couple of years has made a big difference. And I think this India side can cause England a problem. England started as favourites, but some of these guys are seriously... I mean, we haven't mentioned Sai Sudharsan, I think he's a seriously good player.","Former England batter Nick Knight gives his thoughts on the first India-England Test in Leeds from June 20.

Shohei Ohtani reaches triple-digit heat in first inning back

Record-breaking viewership and offensive dominance





Shohei Ohtani made his long-awaited return to the mound for the Los Angeles Dodgers on Monday night at Dodger Stadium, the first time since undergoing second Tommy John surgery in August 2023. In only one inning of pitching, he reawakened a buzz across all of Major League Baseball and led to streaming records via MLB.TV. The game attracted the largest viewership mark in the history of the platform, up 28% on the previous record. With another strong outing as both a pitcher and batter, Ohtani has further established himself as baseball's most exciting two-way player.Ohtani, returning as an ""opener"" with a strict pitch count, threw 28 pitches in the first inning, including a fastball that was clocked at 100.2 mph. He surrendered two hits and one run on his way out of the game. Dodgers manager Dave Roberts clarified that this managed outing is part of a broader plan to help Ohtani slowly transition back into a normal routine for pitching. The team envisions him pitching about once every seven days as he continues to juggle his duties on the mound with his responsibilities at the plate.Ohtani's velocity on the mound brought out some oohs and aahs from the crowd and from fans around the world on Friday, as he showed command.His appearance, though brief, was an important step in his rehab process and provided an insight into how the Dodgers intended to utilize his pitching arm without putting him back on the shelf.Shohei Ohtani may not have pitched long, but Ohtani made his impact. But Monday night's game between the Dodgers and Padres turned into the highest-rated game in all of MLB.TV history. Ohtani experienced a 28% growth in day-one sales (relative to the previous record) that highlighted both Ohtani's global popularity as well as the allure of the loaded Dodgers roster.Also Read: Shohei Ohtani touches 100 mph in electric 2025 pitching debut for Dodgers On the offensive end, Ohtani had another great showing. Including a run-scoring double and an RBI single during the Dodgers' 6–3 victory against the Padres, it was the five-run fourth, a late-game barrage, that confirmed the win for the Dodgers, but Ohtani had already provided the early boost to take his team ahead and into the proper momentum.Ohtani is once again making a case for MVP, hitting .290 with 25 bombs and 11 stolen bases. That has the Dodgers' production this season, and they also lost the pump. Hopefully, his return to the mound will help not only the Dodgers but also the excitement in a league over a once-a-generation talent who keeps pushing the envelope of what is possible in baseball.","Shohei Ohtani made his long-awaited return to the mound for the Los Angeles Dodgers on Monday night. In only one inning of pitching, he reawakened a buzz across all of Major League Baseball. The game attracted the largest viewership mark in the history of the platform, up 28% on the previous record.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121915841,imgsize-1025396,width-400,resizemode-4/121915841.jpg"

Toronto Maple Leafs prepare for life without Mitch Marner







As July 1 approaches, Mitch Marner's future with the Toronto Maple Leafs appears to be slipping away. According to NHL insider Elliotte Friedman, the Maple Leafs have made attempts to engage with Marner’s camp, but so far, there has been no traction. The 27-year-old forward is expected to hit free agency without a contract extension, opening the door for rival teams.Among the teams linked to Marner, the Ottawa Senators are the most surprising name. They’re not yet in serious contention, but they have a young core and cap space that could appeal to Marner. It’s hard to imagine a former Leafs star wearing a Senators jersey, but the possibility is no longer far-fetched. Ottawa’s front office is reportedly preparing a pitch that focuses on a fresh start and leadership opportunities.The Montreal Canadiens and Calgary Flames are also reportedly in the mix, each with their pitch to offer. Montreal offers history, culture, and a massive fan base. Calgary presents a roster that needs a scoring boost, and Marner could be the centerpiece of that change.As Marner’s exit looms, the Leafs are already moving ahead with potential replacements.According to Arthur Staple, Toronto has an interest in New York Rangers forward Mika Zibanejad.

Charlotte Flair gives her take on a women's WrestleMania main event not happening again

“It was the main event of only one night [Becky v Ronda v Charlotte], now we have two nights. So it’s a big deal, like now you have two nights, two different opportunities, so that being the main event of one night was huge. Like it’ll never happen again, unless we go to one night.”





Charlotte Flair does not see a WrestleMania main event for women happening in the future.Charlotte Flair has become one of the most accomplished WWE superstars of this generation. She has claimed 14 World titles and major accolades throughout her WWE career. A huge milestone she etched in her resume was back in 2019, when she became a part of the first-ever women's main event at WrestleMania 35. Despite being a main eventer herself, Flair does not see that incredible sight recreated in the future.In a recent interview with Games with Names, Charlotte Flair spoke about women getting another chance at main eventing WrestleMania. The Queen stated that it would never happen again unless WWE reverted to a one-night format for The Show of Shows.She said,Charlotte Flair competed in the first-ever women's WrestleMania main event. It was a 'Winner Take All' triple-threat match between her, Ronda Rousey , and Becky Lynch at WrestleMania 35.Rousey walked into the match as the RAW Women's Champion, while Flair was the SmackDown Women's Champion. The trio delivered a highly captivating showdown that ended in Lynch becoming a double champion and taking her fame to unprecedented heights. This was the last Mania under the one-night era.Furthermore, two women got a chance to main event The Showcase of the Immortals under its two-day format. Two years after Lynch won the titles in grand fashion, Sasha Banks and Bianca Belair competed in the main event of Night 1 of WrestleMania 37. Moreover, it was two black women to headline the match, which made it even more significant, and saw Belair winning the match and the SmackDown Women's title.With the history etching two remarkable women's WrestleMania main events, it remains to be seen if the current crop of talent can prove Flair's statement to be wrong and achieve that same prestigious accolade.Also read: WWE RAW Results & Highlights (6/16/25): Cody Rhodes vs Jey Uso set for next week, Goldberg returns and more","Charlotte Flair was a part of the first-ever women's main event at WrestleMania 35.

With fresh energy, tough practices, and a belief that’s turning heads, Denver is no longer just rebuilding—they're coming.Albert Breer, writing for Sports Illustrated, singled out the Broncos as the top threat to Kansas City’s eight-year division dominance. Despite rising expectations for the Chargers and Raiders, it’s Sean Payton’s group in Denver that’s earned the most respect this offseason. “I think the Broncos might be emerging as the Chiefs’ top threat,” Breer wrote.The confidence isn’t just about roster upgrades—it’s about culture. “I saw the gassers they ran and the two-and-a-half-hour practice they scheduled,” Breer explained. “It’s hard for me to see a group that’s bought in the way this one is to backslide.” Denver’s 10-win 2024 season wasn’t a fluke—and the league is taking notice.Sean Payton, now entering his third season with the Broncos, emphasized the team’s mentality and standards.“I think they have a high standard of how they see themselves, and where we can be,” he was quoted as saying in the Denver Post. His coaching continuity and discipline are proving to be a catalyst for belief across the roster.Key to Denver’s rise is the defense, led by Vance Joseph, which has become a physically imposing and mentally sharp unit. On offense, rookie QB Bo Nix is surrounded with talent and guidance, positioned to make a leap. With Courtland Sutton, Marvin Mims Jr., and Javonte Williams, the pieces are quietly aligning.Meanwhile, Kansas City remains the division favorite—but cracks are forming. The offense, while potent, struggled with consistency last season, and offseason departures have tightened the margin. That leaves a narrow opening for a surging Denver team hungry for a power shift in the West.Also read: Patrick Mahomes' Super Bowl shame reignites debate — Is he still the NFL’s most feared quarterback? The NFL has already circled the Broncos-Chiefs rivalry with a Christmas Day rematch set at Arrowhead. That clash could end up deciding the division—and perhaps signaling a new AFC West era. If Breer is right, the Broncos aren’t just chasing the Chiefs anymore. They’re coming for the crown.","The Denver Broncos are on the rise, according to NFL insider Albert Breer. Breer says the Broncos are the top threat to the Chiefs' AFC West dominance. Denver’s 10-win 2024 season wasn’t a fluke, and the league is taking notice.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121922062,imgsize-79526,width-400,resizemode-4/121922062.jpg"
Fabiano Caruana takes a dig at 19-year-old Indian world champion D Gukesh - 'not scary yet',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/chess/chess-fabiano-caruana-takes-a-dig-at-19-year-old-indian-world-champion-d-gukesh-not-scary-yet/articleshow/121921962.cms,"Fabiano Caruana of USA during the first game of Norway Chess in Finansparken in Stavanger, Norway, Monday, May 26, 2025.

Poll Do you agree with Fabiano Caruana's assessment that Indian Grandmasters are 'not scary' yet? Yes, I agree. No, I disagree.





World No. 3 Fabiano Caruana has made a bold statement about 19-year-old world champion Gukesh and other Indian Grandmasters, calling them ""not scary whatsoever"" after the Norway Chess tournament.“These Indian players are very strong. I think we’ll be competing on more or less equal terms for a while. But I don’t find them scary yet. Whatsoever!” Caruana said on his C-Squared podcast.“When I play, for example, Arjun or Gukesh, I do get this feeling — not just based on this Norway Chess tournament, but across many events — that I can really outplay them significantly and get a lot of winning chances.""I don’t think they can outplay me in the same way. Although they will get winning chances, it then comes down to other factors. This is my honest opinion.""It’s not about playing them down. They can definitely outperform me in various ways. But my feeling is that in a long match, while they’re great fighters, they also give a lot of chances. And for them, it can be frustrating to play against someone who gives very few.”At the recently concluded Norway Chess tournament, Caruana defeated Gukesh on the final day, crushing the Indian teenager’s hopes of winning the title.Caruana later explained that despite Indian prodigies like Gukesh and Arjun Erigaisi performing well recently, a shift in the global chess hierarchy is unlikely in the near future as the Indians have not yet reached their full potential.“If Levon Aronian, who is 10 years older than me, is competing on equal terms with these young guys — or Hikaru, who is five years older, and still appears stronger than most of them — then why assume they’ll take over soon? Especially when Magnus is clearly stronger than all of them,” he said. Magnus Carlsen went on to win his seventh title in Stavanger, while Caruana pipped Gukesh to second place. Hikaru Nakamura finished fourth, ahead of Arjun Erigaisi.","World No. 3 Fabiano Caruana says Indian Grandmasters are 'not scary yet' Caruana defeated 19-year-old world champion Gukesh at Norway Chess tournament.

Ravi Shastri's India XI for the first Test

Yashasvi Jaiswal KL Rahul Sai Sudarshan Shubman Gill Karun Nair Rishabh Pant Ravindra Jadeja Shardul Thakur or Nitish Reddy Mohammed Siraj Jasprit Bumrah Prasidh Krishna or Arshdeep Singh





Former India Head Coach Ravi Shastri has revealed his preferred playing XI for India's upcoming first Test match against England at Headingley, starting June 20. The series marks new captain Shubman Gill's first assignment following the Test retirements of Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma, as India faces the world's second-ranked team in challenging conditions during the new World Test Championship cycle.For the opening combination, Shastri advocates for Yashasvi Jaiswal and KL Rahul to take the crease. He emphasized Rahul's experience and previous success in England as crucial factors. ""It would be Jaiswal, and with him will be KL Rahul, because I think this is a big tour for him. He's the most experienced of the batsmen,"" Shastri stated. ""He opened last time when India toured England, got a hundred, and had a good tour. So I would hope for him to open the innings.""Shastri recommended young Sai Sudarshan for the number three position, citing his impressive performances. ""Three, I'll go with the youngster, Sai Sudarshan. Whatever I've seen of him, he's very impressive. This will be good exposure for him, this tour,"" he explained.The newly appointed Test captain Shubman Gill, who has played 32 matches in his red-ball international career, will bat at number four in Shastri's lineup.For the crucial middle-order positions, the former India coach backed Karun Nair at number five and Rishabh Pant at six. He particularly praised Nair's recent performances and determination to return to the national team. ""In all probability, depending on what current form is, it'll be Karun Nair. He bats at five, it's a long time since he played for India. Six will be Pant,"" said the 63-year-old.He further elaborated on Nair's selection, saying, ""I think he has worked really hard. He's just worked his way back into the side. The number of runs he's got in first-last cricket is incredible. And I met him during an IPL game. I said, 'don't just bang the door. Just kick it down and make your way in and walk into that side'. And I think he's done just that. Just the number of runs that he's got has made the selectors look in that direction and give him a place. ""For the bowling combination, Shastri opined that Ravindra Jadeja must come in at number seven as the primary spinner, followed by three fast bowlers and an all-rounder.The former coach faces a tough choice between two fast-bowling all-rounders - Shardul Thakur and Nitish Reddy - for one spot in the team. ""I would go with three fast bowlers, plus Shardul Thakur. I know it'll be a tough one between Shardul and Nitish Reddy, but you have to see who bowls how much. If Reddy is going to give you 12, 14 overs, then he might get the nod because of his batting,"" Shastri explained.For the pace attack, Shastri proposes Mohammed Siraj and Jasprit Bumrah as certainties, with either Prasidh Krishna or Arshdeep Singh as the third option, depending on the conditions. ""And the three fast bowlers would be, I would go with Prasid Krishna, I would go with Mohammed Siraj and of course Jasprit Bumrah. In Leeds, if it's overcast and it's cloudy, there might be the temptation of going with the left-armer Ashdeep Singh as well. So it will be Prasad, Prasid Krishna/Ashdeep but the other two will be Siraj and Bumrah,"" he concluded.",Ravi Shastri names XI for India's first Test against England at Headingley.

It certainly hasn’t been easy. I’ll tell you that for free! One thing that served me well is to never be content. The more I play, the more information there is for other teams to work with in terms of modes of dismissals or weaknesses. You’ve got to find ways of combating that and make sure there isn’t a flaw that stays in your game for too long.It’s about constantly looking to evolve, finding ways of scoring off good balls, being able to rotate strike from good deliveries so it’s difficult for individual bowlers to build pressure. Doing that has given me an opportunity to stay relatively consistent, but also realistic about good and bad times. There are going to be periods when it’s tough. It’s about how you react and how quickly you can turn things around through hard work and honest reflection.Every player is different. If you’re in a five-match Test series and there’s something in your game that doesn’t sit well with you, it can be difficult. You haven’t got time to go and get two weeks off to work on that thing. There’s no breathing space unless you make a drastic change within a Test. But then you’re playing against some very high-quality players in their own conditions. And let’s not forget, a lot of people will keep mentioning how you got out!Kohli still got 100 in that first Test (in Perth), which India won.It’s all about what you can do to wrestle things back in your favour — whether it’s a change of guard or batting out of your crease or in your crease, or to try and create width by staying leg-side of the ball rather than feeling like you’ve got to make technical changes in that short span.Whenever you make a change, there could be massive pros to it and slight cons to it. You’ve got to work out if it’s worth doing each and every time. So, it’s a lot to take in and manage, but with experience and more understanding of your own game, it should be easier.I wouldn’t say it didn’t sit well with me. I struggled towards the back end in terms of results, but we had our own challenges with the amount of games we played in Covid environments and being away from families. But with that it presented a fresh start for this team and a new coach, new captain, new way of looking at playing Tests.One thing I’d say, having been captain for a long period of time, is to make sure you always stay genuine to what you believe is the right way to go about things. As soon as you start trying to play someone else’s way of cricket, it’s going to be hard to be authentic and to bring out the best version of yourself.It’s about managing your own game, trying to play for the highest reward with the lowest risk possible, for as long as possible. That’s the art of batting, clearly. Maybe, having a slightly different role within the team helped. Having someone like ‘Baz’ (McCullum) come into our environment and have a slightly different way of looking at the game opened my mind up to seeing situations differently.No. I just think the younger crop looks at things differently. Cricket across formats is always evolving. Players are always trying to find different ways to stay ahead of trends, whether that’s modes of dismissal as a batter, or if you bowl in a certain way, having as many options and skills as possible.Within Tests, teams have more modes of operation now, even in bowling attacks. There are more left-armers, more varied spinners. Guys use the crease a lot more than maybe they would have done 20 years ago. There are a lot of subtle changes the introduction of T20s has provided Test cricket.Now, even if the game is played a little bit quicker, teams try to score a little bit faster. There are passages of play which you have to manage differently.That said, even when you’re scoring quickly, you still have to be able to absorb pressure. So, there’s definitely an element of stubbornness, that willingness to be tough, to outlast the other side. But the way it looks and the way you have to use that stubbornness is slightly different to how it was 20 years ago.Tests are the pinnacle of the sport. Wherever you are, you’re faced with different challenges. In the subcontinent the ball might be spinning, there’s a different bounce. The ball itself is different. There’s heat to contend with. When you come here, it can be quite cold, can swing around, it can be green and nipping everywhere. The Dukes ball does different things. You go to Australia, again, it’s very different. Same with South Africa.The fact is you have to manage so many different factors, right over five days, and the wicket can change drastically. All of the little intricacies of the game make it, in my eyes, stand above the rest. The more we can celebrate that and protect it and showcase it to the rest of the world, the better.It’s a very difficult question to answer. Everyone has a different rate of development. Look at someone like Harry Brook — came straight into the team, duck to water.Incredible. There are other players that take a little bit longer, but it doesn’t mean they’re not going to be successful. Look at Michael Hussey , he didn’t play Test cricket till he was in his late 20s, early 30s.It’s not straightforward. It might be that someone like (Yashasvi) Jaiswal comes in and has an amazing series, like he did against the West Indies, and goes to Australia and scores a hundred. Everyone’s journey is unique, but some people just take that little bit longer.Being a selector is not something that I look forward to down the line! I can imagine, being in India, with the amount of talent and the amount of players there are to pick from, it’d be a very difficult thing to get right. To navigate through that must be a real challenge.","Joe Root talks to TOI about the changing nature of Test batsmanship.

Keon Coleman ’s raw honesty and Josh Allen ’s quiet shift in tone spark fresh tension in Buffalo



Tush Push twist – Allen goes against the vote





There’s something shifting inside the Buffalo Bills locker room. A rookie receiver is holding nothing back, the franchise quarterback is keeping expectations low, and one of the NFL’s most debated plays has divided opinions. As preseason storylines unfold, Buffalo’s internal dynamics are already making waves across the league. And at the heart of it all stands Josh Allen—more vocal, more measured, and slightly at odds with his own team.Keon Coleman, the Bills' second-round draft pick, is already making headlines—not for his performance, but his brutal self-assessment. “You want to know exactly what I see? Man, that shit trash,” he said when asked about his early days. The comment, while unfiltered, reveals a raw honesty not often seen in NFL rookies. For Buffalo fans, it’s a moment that signals both humility and hunger.Josh Allen, however, is approaching Coleman’s journey with patience rather than pressure. “I wouldn’t say I expect anything out of him, but all I can say is he is 100% taking this seriously,” Allen said in a recent Sports Illustrated interview. “He’s bigger right now.He’s faster. He’s stronger. He understands the playbook better.” The Bills QB appears more focused on chemistry than instant output.Allen also praised Coleman’s willingness to improve and communicate. “We’re still conversing about how we can be better, where certain balls will be thrown,” he added. “He’s a very hungry kid, and I think that going out there and playing the way I do, I think it’ll be a very good year for him.” The message is clear: Allen sees long-term potential taking root.Off the field, Allen has taken a surprising stance on a topic that recently dominated NFL meetings—the Tush Push. Despite the Bills being among 22 teams that voted to ban the short-yardage quarterback sneak, Allen defended the tactic. “I’m a big believer in if you can’t stop it, keep running it, right?” he said, taking a stand that contradicts team management.Allen didn’t hold back on why some teams succeed while others fail with the play. “Some teams don’t practice it enough or don’t have the guys to do it,” he explained. “Just because a couple teams do it better than others, I don’t feel like it should be banned.” His comments align with Philadelphia Eagles star Jason Kelce, who helped lead the charge to preserve the play.Also read: Josh Allen’s ex Brittany Williams glows solo after NFL star’s California wedding to Hailee Steinfeld With training camp around the corner, the spotlight on the Bills only intensifies.

Potential Trade Package

The Bigger Picture: Lakers’ Offseason Strategy





Theentered the 2025 season with high expectations after acquiring Luka Dončić to pair with LeBron James . However, their early playoff exit against the Minnesota Timberwolves exposed glaring roster flaws. Now, the front office is eyeing upgrades, and a surprising target has emerged: former Boston Celtics defensive stalwart Marcus Smart.According to Bovada, the Los Angeles Lakers hold the second-best odds (+200) to land Smart, trailing only the Sacramento Kings (+150). With Washington likely moving on from the veteran guard, Los Angeles sees an opportunity to bolster its defense and add championship experience.Despite limited playing time over the past two seasons (just 54 total games), Marcus Smart remains a proven difference-maker. His resume includes:- 2019-20 NBA All-Defensive First Team- 2021-22 Defensive Player of the Year- Key contributor to Boston’s 2022 Finals runThe Los Angeles Lakers struggled defensively last season, ranking 18th in defensive rating. Smart’s ability to guard multiple positions and disrupt opposing offenses would immediately address this weakness.As Matt John of Athlon Sports noted in the original report: ""Smart is a former Defensive Player of the Year who helped the Celtics make multiple extensive playoff runs, including a run to the NBA Finals in 2022.""While Los Angeles is a strong suitor, other teams are also in the mix:The Kings’ slightly better odds stem from their need for backcourt defense, but the Lakers’ championship pedigree could sway Smart’s decision.Washington isn’t expected to demand a hefty return for Smart, given their rebuild. The Lakers could offer:- A future second-round pick- A young prospect (e.g., Jalen Hood-Schifino)- Salary filler (e.g., Taurean Prince)This low-risk move would allow LA to retain flexibility for bigger trades while adding a proven playoff performer.Marcus Smart isn’t the only piece the Lakers need, but he fits their timeline. Here’s why:1. Defensive Upgrade – Smart’s tenacity would complement the offensive firepower of James and Dončić 2. Leadership – His experience in high-pressure games would benefit a roster with title aspirations.3. Cost-Effective – Unlike blockbuster trades, acquiring Smart wouldn’t gut the Lakers’ assets.The Los Angeles Lakers’ interest in Marcus Smart signals a pragmatic approach to roster-building. While he won’t solve all their problems, his defensive intensity and playoff pedigree make him an ideal target. If Los Angeles can outmaneuver Sacramento, this move could pay dividends in their quest for another championship.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Los Angeles Lakers Might Sign $100 Million Brooklyn Nets superstar; Backups In Store Too?

2025 highlights: Familiar faces and dramatic falls



Is it just madness or tradition





Every year on a steep hill in Gloucestershire, England, hundreds gather to chase a rolling 7-pound wheel of Double Gloucester cheese down a dangerously steep slope. Known as the Cooper’s Hill Cheese Rolling Contest, the event is chaotic, absurd, and completely thrilling. With participants tumbling, somersaulting, and crashing their way to the bottom, the headline “People sprint to catch a 7-pound wheel of cheese” is technically accurate, but it doesn’t quite capture the madness, tradition, and injuries that define this bizarre British spectacle. So, is it a good headline? That depends on what you’re hoping to convey.The Cheese Rolling Contest is an annual event held on Cooper’s Hill in Brockworth, Gloucestershire. Dating back at least two centuries, and possibly much longer, the race involves competitors hurtling down a 200-yard slope after a large wheel of cheese. The goal? Be the first to reach the bottom and claim the cheese as a prize. It sounds simple, but the event is notorious for its steep incline, dangerous tumbles, and frequent injuries.The hill is so steep that it's nearly impossible to stay upright. Most participants end up tumbling head over heels, colliding with each other or the ground.Gravity takes over quickly, and the cheese, reaching speeds of up to 70 mph, is almost never actually caught. Still, competitors willingly risk sprains, fractures, and concussions for a shot at glory and a round of cheese.This year, German YouTuber Tom Kopke claimed victory for the second year in a row. Shirtless and triumphant, he declared, “I risked my life for this. It’s my cheese. Back to back.” On the women’s side, Ava Sender Logan from London tumbled repeatedly but emerged victorious, saying, “It felt quite long coming down and then I hit my head. I’m fine.” Around them, spectators packed the woods and fences for a glimpse of the chaos.While the event may seem absurd to outsiders, for locals and returning participants, it’s a point of pride and cultural identity. Despite calls to regulate or cancel it over safety concerns, the contest continues to thrive, drawing international competitors and media attention. Volunteers, medics, and long-time residents treat it as an important local tradition","The Cheese Rolling Contest is an annual event held on Cooper’s Hill in Brockworth, Gloucestershire. The race involves competitors hurtling down a 200-yard slope after a large wheel of cheese. The goal? Be the first to reach the bottom and claim the cheese as a prize.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121438923,imgsize-2046868,width-400,resizemode-4/121438923.jpg"

Eshan Chattopadhyay, associate professor at Cornell University and David Zuckerman, professor of computer science at The University of Texas at Austin have been awarded the 2025 Gödel Prize.The prize was awarded for their research paper, “Explicit Two-Source Extractors and Resilient Functions,” which presents a landmark solution to a central open problem in randomness extraction.Originally published in 2019, the paper introduced a novel method for constructing explicit two-source extractors—mathematical tools used to generate high-quality randomness from two weakly random sources.Eshan Chattopadhyay, an Indian-origin professor, completed his PhD at The University of Texas at Austin before joining Cornell University. His research focuses on pseudorandomness, circuit complexity, and communication complexity. In 2021, he received the National Science Foundation CAREER Award.Expressing his gratitude, Chattopadhyay said, “This recognition is truly an incredible honor. The Gödel Prize has celebrated some of the most beautiful and foundational work in our field. It feels surreal—and deeply gratifying—that our paper is being placed in that category.”David Zuckerman earned his PhD from the University of California, Berkeley.

Kuldeep Yadav hints at spin-friendly wicket ahead of England Test series

Poll Will the absence of Mohammed Shami impact India's performance in the series? Yes, he is a key player. No, we have strong alternatives.





Former India head coach Ravi Shastri and bowling coach Bharat Arun revealed how Mohammed Shami 's anger over a plate of biryani during lunch led to a match-winning performance against South Africa in Johannesburg in 2018. The incident occurred on the fourth day of the final Test match when South Africa needed 223 runs with eight wickets in hand to complete a series whitewash.The hosts had already secured the series by winning the first two matches. By lunch on the fourth day, South Africa had reduced the deficit to 171 runs with seven wickets remaining.During the lunch break, Shastri noticed Shami with a large serving of biryani on his plate while walking past.""It was Johannesburg. Final day. There was enough heat in that game. That match on the last day, they needed 240, just 100 runs to get. Eight wickets in hand. It was lunchtime and as I was walking past, Shami's plate. He had a massive helping of biryani there,"" Shastri recounted onBharat Arun shared that Shastri approached Shami and questioned him about his hunger after seeing the biryani.""Ravi walked across and asked him, 'tera bhook idhar theek ho gaya kya?' (Is your stomach full after eating the biryani?)""Shami responded angrily by rejecting the plate of biryani completely.""Le le plate. Nahi chahiye biryani, bhaad main gaya biryani (Take the plate. I don't want the biryani. It can go to hell),"" Shastri recalled Shami saying.Following this exchange, Shastri advised Arun to leave Shami alone.""Ravi came to me and said, 'Woh (Shami) gussa hai, usko aise he chod doh.' (He is angry. Leave him alone). 'Agar kuch baat karna hai toh bolo, thoda wicket leke mujhe batao' (If he wants to speak, tell him to go get wickets in the middle). Being angry is one thing, but to channelise that in your bowling is another thing,"" Arun shared.The anger proved beneficial as Shami went on to deliver a remarkable performance in the final innings. He claimed a five-wicket haul, with South Africa's last seven batters managing to score only 22 runs between them.After the match concluded, Arun offered the same plate of biryani to Shami again, leading to a lighthearted moment.""Game over. He came over and Arun went and gave 'biryani le, ab jitna khaana hai, khaa le (Take the biryani, eat as much as you want). Humko hamesha gussa karao phir theek ho jaate hai (Make me angry all the time, then I become fine). Typical Shami,"" Shastri recalled.The victory marked India's second win at the Wanderers Stadium and their third overall victory on South African soil.",Former India head coach Ravi Shastri and bowling coach Bharat Arun revealed how Mohammed Shami's anger over a plate of biryani during lunch led to a match- winning performance against South Africa in 2018.

Inside Josh Allen and Hailee Steinfeld’s tropical honeymoon: First official photos spark internet swoon







After weeks of keeping fans waiting, Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen and actress-singer Hailee Steinfeld finally let the world in on their newlywed bliss. On Tuesday, Allen shared the first official photos from their tropical honeymoon, and the images radiate romance, warmth, and a sense of joy that only comes from two people madly in love.Following their lavish wedding at the picturesque San Ysidro Ranch in Santa Barbara on May 31, the couple slipped away into privacy — something that’s become a rare luxury for two public figures of their stature. Their ceremony was filled with love and laughter, as well as familiar NFL faces, including Allen’s Bills teammates and head coach Sean McDermott. While paparazzi managed to snap moments from the outdoor celebration that quickly went viral, the couple chose to keep their post-wedding life under wraps—until now.Hailee Steinfeld gave fans a subtle tease last week through her personal newsletter, Beau Society. “The next day, Josh and I ran off into the sunset to our honeymoon (more on that later?). Now we’re back, and it’s been a whole 13 days of being married, and we’ll be staying on this high forever!” she wrote, giving just a hint of their joy without revealing much.But Allen’s recent Instagram post changed that. Captioned simply “Wifey ❤️,” the MVP quarterback posted a collage featuring tropical scenes, including the couple adorned in leis — an island touch that sparked speculation about a Hawaiian getaway.While the exact location remains a mystery, fans can only imagine the paradise setting behind those beaming smiles.Hailee, on her end, complemented the narrative with her own social media tribute. She shared a collage of unseen wedding photos on June 17, cheekily captioned, “HUSBAND!” One of the images humorously teased a NSFW-looking ring shot that fans couldn’t stop talking about.In her latest newsletter entry, Steinfeld opened up more emotionally. “Over the past two weeks, random yet very specific memories have been popping back into our heads, and we’ve been blurting them out to each other, often through smiles, laughs, and tears. In no particular order, these are the moments we can’t stop thinking about.” She added, “I’m sitting here with Josh, and we’re reminiscing on the best weekend of our lives for the millionth time. ”The couple's honeymoon wasn’t just about palm trees and champagne — though there was plenty of that too. A photo revealed the newlyweds popping bubbly on a private jet, and Allen even introduced Steinfeld to one of his favorite offseason pastimes: golf. Whether she's becoming a golf fan herself remains to be seen, but the smiles suggest she’s enjoying the ride.With Josh Allen heading into the 2025 NFL season as a newly married man and Hailee balancing her booming career, the couple seems to be embracing both love and life with equal enthusiasm. And from what fans can tell, this is just the beginning of a beautiful journey.Also Read: Matthew Stafford’s wife Kelly Stafford opens up about using weed gummies to manage parenting stress with four daughters","Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen and actress-singer Hailee Steinfeld have kept their honeymoon under wraps.

Kansas City Chiefs risk sabotaging Patrick Mahomes' Super Bowl hopes by delaying $23 million Trey Smith deal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/kansas-city-chiefs-risk-sabotaging-patrick-mahomes-super-bowl-hopes-by-delaying-23-million-trey-smith-deal/articleshow/121919059.cms,"Chiefs face a July 15 deadline to secure a long-term deal with offensive guard Trey Smith (Getty Images)

The franchise tag may not be enough to keep Patrick Mahomes protected for long

A long-term deal for Trey Smith could define the Chiefs’ next chapter





As the Kansas City Chiefs prepare for another high-stakes NFL season, one name looms large in the team's offseason strategy: Trey Smith . The 25-year-old offensive guard is currently playing under a non-exclusive franchise tag worth $23.4 million. While that figure ensures Smith's short-term presence, it leaves significant uncertainty for the long-term future of both the player and the franchise.The Chiefs now face a crucial July 15 deadline to negotiate a long-term deal with Smith. If they fail, he’ll play the upcoming season under the hefty one-year tag—without any guarantee of staying beyond it.Last season’s crushing 40-22 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl LIX exposed serious flaws in the Chiefs' offensive line. Despite Patrick Mahomes’ brilliance, he was constantly under siege, struggling to make plays as the Eagles’ defense dismantled the protection unit.NFL analyst Kristopher Knox from Bleacher Report didn’t mince words when he called attention to the issue. “The Kansas City Chiefs have remained in the Super Bowl picture ever since Patrick Mahomes took over as their starting quarterback. However, offensive deficiencies loomed large during Kansas City's 40-22 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl LIX,"" Knox wrote.""The Chiefs' offensive line was particularly problematic, as the Eagles defense consistently harassed Mahomes and shut down almost everything Kansas City did offensively. ”That performance served as a wake-up call. For the Chiefs, the message is clear: Mahomes may be the engine, but without solid protection, even the most elite quarterbacks can be neutralized.Trey Smith is not just any guard. Since entering the NFL, he’s proven to be a foundational piece of Kansas City’s offensive front. Locking him into a multi-year deal would not only provide Mahomes with a trusted protector but also reinforce the team’s commitment to offensive excellence.Knox added, “Reloading the line is this year's top offseason priority. The remaining work must start with an extension for guard Trey Smith, who is currently set to play on the franchise tag. The Chiefs have until July 15 to negotiate a long-term deal with the 25-year-old, which they have planned to do since giving him the tag.”Also Read: “Still going to fear him”: Despite lowest stats of career, Travis Kelce gets fierce support from Emmanuel Acho Fans and analysts agree—relying solely on the franchise tag could backfire.
