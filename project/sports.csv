Poll What are your thoughts on Yuzvendra Chahal's choice of attire at the divorce hearing? Inappropriate and disrespectful A bold statement Completely fine, it's his choice I have no opinion on it

Yuzvendra Chahal's estranged wife, Dhanashree Verma, has finally spoken about her divorce and slammed the Indian cricketer for his attire at the divorce hearing.Chahal appeared wearing a black t-shirt with the words “Be your own sugar daddy”. The move triggered a storm on social media, with many interpreting it as a subtle dig at Dhanashree.“Divorce is not something to celebrate. It’s not a celebration; it’s something very sad and deeply emotional. People must not forget that it’s not just about the two individuals, but also about the families involved—those who genuinely love and care about you,” she said on the podcast Spill The Tea.“I also believe true grief and chaos in a marriage have to be understood and acknowledged by both parties. Marriage begins with love, but when it ends, it often ends in distrust. The day it actually happened was very emotional for me, my family, and I’m sure for everyone around us. Even though we were mentally prepared for it, when the verdict was about to be given, I broke down completely. I started howling in front of everyone,” she recalled.Dhanashree strongly criticised Chahal’s choice of t-shirt on the divorce hearing.“He walked out first, and that whole t-shirt episode unfolded. I wasn’t even aware of it at the time because I was still inside. I left through the back door because I didn’t want to face the media. I was just wearing a simple t-shirt and jeans.“I sat in my car, still trying to catch my breath. Before I even realised what had happened, people began speculating about me because of that stunt. Sitting there, I felt like, ‘It’s done. It’s dusted.’“Somewhere, I did feel bad. Why was I even crying about this? Then I thought, forget it—let’s just end this. That moment gave me the motivation to laugh and move on. It’s over,” she added.","Yuzvendra Chahal appeared wearing a black t-shirt with the words “Be your own sugar daddy’ The move triggered a storm on social media, with many interpreting it as a subtle dig at Dhanashree. “Divorce is not something to celebrate; it’s something very sad and deeply emotional,” she said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123398560,imgsize-53994,width-400,resizemode-4/123398560.jpg"

“In the law of defamation truth is a defence.”

Devin Haney, the world champion boxer, has taken his fight out of the ring and into court. According to TMZ Sports, on Wednesday in Los Angeles, Devin Haney filed a lawsuit against the mother of his baby daughter, Leena Sayed. The boxer claims Sayed tried to extort him by threatening his reputation and his rights to see his child. This comes less than two months after Sayed received a temporary restraining order against him. Haney says in the court papers that Sayed has spread “false and defamatory” stories about him, which he says are damaging his career and image. He also accused her of causing him emotional distress and is asking for damages. His lawyer, Bobby Samini, told TMZ Sports,The court filing took place on Wednesday, August 20, 2025, in Los Angeles, California. In his lawsuit, Devin Haney says Leena Sayed threatened to ruin his public image unless he gave her more money. He also claims she told him he could lose his rights to visit their daughter, named Khrome, who was born in January this year.Devin Haney’s legal team is asking the court to award him damages for what they describe as “extreme and outrageous” behavior.They also accuse Sayed of inventing claims of physical abuse. This legal action comes only weeks after Sayed told the court in her restraining order request that Haney had abused her several times over the past year and a half.One of her main claims is that in December 2024, when she was nine months pregnant, Haney allegedly pushed her, causing her to fall on her back.

Poll Do you think Vanessa Bryant handled the pregnancy rumors well? Yes, very cleverly No, she should have addressed them directly

Met Gala Surprise: Rihanna Stuns With Baby Bump Reveal, A$AP Rocky Confirms It’s Baby No 3

After days of unrelenting speculation, Vanessa Bryant took to Instagram Stories on Sunday, June 1, to put the rumors to rest. Her response wasn’t a press statement or a legal warning, it was a wild meme with a big middle finger to the internet trolls. The meme featured music icon Rihanna floating in water with a snorkel mask on her head, holding a drink, and flipping her middle finger.“Me protecting my peace, not pregnant & having fun all summer,” Vanessa Bryant wrote in the caption on her response to the online trolls who spread her pregnancy rumors about five years after her husband, Kobe Bryant ’s, untimely and devastating demise.It was clear, clever, and vintage Vanessa who shut down noise without saying a word about the origin of the gossip. No press release needed when you’ve got Rihanna energy with a direct middle finger gesture.The rumors had emerged out of nowhere, with some users pointing to photos allegedly showing a ""baby bump,"" though no timestamps or context were attached to those images. Vanessa hasn't been publicly linked to anyone romantically, and there’s been zero confirmation from her side—until now.In another Instagram Story later that evening, Vanessa shared a motivational quote that hinted at how she views the entire situation and what matters to her personally.“The only way to impress me, is by being a good person,” the quote read. “I don’t care what you have, what you wear, where you live, or what you drive. I just have deep respect for people with pure hearts and good intentions.”Adding one final touch to her trilogy of clapbacks, she posted another Rihanna meme, this one stating, “I’m not mean, I’m just not the one.”With the classic Rihanna memes, Vanessa showed that she is busy being a proud mom to her daughters while being the powerhouse of her business ventures. While she does not care about the rumor mill, her reaction explicitly showed that she is urging privacy.Recently, Renaldo Wilson, the brother of WNBA star A’ja Wilson, has spoken out after a fake photo involving (who appears to be) Celtics forward Jaylen Brown and Vanessa Bryant started spreading online.Vanessa Bryant, who shares four daughters with Kobe— Natalia, Bianka, Capri, and the late Gianna— has remained devoted to family and philanthropy. Most recently, she shared footage of a joyful family ski trip over the holidays, showing the tight-knit bond she maintains with her children.Natalia Bryant stepped into the fashion world just like her mother, officially joining IMG Models in 2021 at the age of 18. “Ever since I can remember, I wanted to model,” she shared in a statement posted by IMG on Instagram. “There is a lot to learn, but I feel this is a great opportunity for me to learn and express myself creatively.”Vanessa and Kobe Bryant tied the knot in April 2001. Tragically, in January 2020, Kobe and their 13-year-old daughter Gianna lost their lives in a helicopter crash that also killed seven others. They were headed to Kobe’s Mamba Sports Academy for a youth basketball game when the accident occurred. Kobe was 41 at the time. The loss shook the sports world and left a lasting impact on fans, friends, and loved ones across the globe. Kobe has left a huge legacy to his name as well, he is considered one the of the elite NBA superstars of all time with astounding stats, records and intense playmaking abilities. His demise created a huge void in the NBA world as fans are still mourning his untimely passing.Since their passing, she’s kept their memory alive through meaningful business ventures and charitable work. Kobe launched the Mamba Sports Foundation in 2016, aiming to support young athletes. After his death, Vanessa renamed it the Mamba & Mambacita Sports Foundation in honor of both Kobe and Gianna. Today, the foundation helps underserved boys and girls in sports, pushing forward the mission they believed in. It's her way of carrying on their legacy with purpose and heart.Vanessa Bryant’s response was indeed witty and empowering as she hinted that she deserves privacy and reminded the world that while she may be a public figure, her peace and dignity aren’t up for debate, especially not over unfounded gossip. After the viral response via memes, Vanessa has seemingly closed the chapter as she did not extend the matter any further with any other comments about it afterwards.Days after shutting down the pregnancy rumor, Vanessa Bryant made a glowing courtside appearance with her daughters at the New York Liberty vs. Chicago Sky game. The WNBA shared a sweet clip showing Vanessa alongside Natalia, 22, Bianka, 8, and Capri, 5, all smiling and waving for the camera.Later, Vanessa uploaded an image of her in a restaurant, candidly posing as she waited for the food to be arrive. Considering the dress, it appears that the photograph was shot after her recent attendance in the game.Their family moment quickly caught fans’ attention online, adding a warm highlight to the evening. It was a rare and heartwarming public outing for the Bryant family, showing their strong support for women’s basketball. It was Vanessa's first public outing since she debunked the horrendous pregnancy rumors.Recently, Vanessa honored her husband Kobe's memory with a heartfelt Instagram post on Instagram, sharing a throwback photograph of the family with the NBA legend, ""Happy Fathers Day @kobebryant 💕 You are so missed. We love you so much. #GirlDad 💕💕""Earlier this July, Vanessa Bryant added another heartfelt moment to her social media with a birthday post for her sister, Sophie. The sweet throwback photo featured Vanessa, her late husband Kobe Bryant, and Sophie together, smiling during happier times. It comes after several touching family updates, including daughter Natalia’s recent USC graduation and emotional tribute to her dad.As for her fortune, Vanessa's net worth has seen major growth over the years. While Kobe Bryant’s NBA success helped build their fortune, Vanessa carved her own path, too. She’s earned recognition as a model, businesswoman, and philanthropist, adding to her wealth through years of steady work.As of 2025, her estimated net worth is $600 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth. A large portion of that came from Kobe’s estate, after his tragic passing in 2020. At the time, Forbes valued the Lakers legend’s net worth at $600 million.Vanessa Bryant just shared a sweet throwback-inspired moment that melted hearts online. Her youngest daughter, Capri, recreated one of Kobe Bryant’s most iconic photos from 1999—wearing a cast and pajamas just like her dad did after a wrist injury. Vanessa captioned the photo, “Like father, like daughter. 💜 Capri Kobe Bryant 💜 #BabyMamba #KokoBean 💜💛🐍,” reminding fans how Kobe’s spirit lives on through their kids. From raising her children to keeping Kobe's memory alive, Vanessa has been an example of love and a remarkable parent. Also, there is no report of her seeing anyone as she remains loyal to her beloved husband Kobe, cherishing his legacy with their kids.Vanessa Bryant’s newest tribute arrives just months after she shared memories from a snowy holiday getaway with her daughters. Last December, she posted sweet moments on Instagram— showing the girls toasting marshmallows and skiing through the snow. Little Capri even shared a carousel ride with Vanessa, making the winter trip extra special.Additionally, Vanessa Bryant also grabs headlines for her friendship with several celebrities including Ciara, she often comments and likes the posts of her friends on social media. As of now, Vanessa is keeping a low profile about her personal life like always.Recently, Vanessa Bryant touched hearts with a heartfelt tribute to Kobe Bryant, joined by daughters Natalia, Bianka, and Capri during the Dodgers’ Bobblehead Night. She shared sweet photos from the emotional occasion, and her Instagram post celebrating Kobe Bryant’s legacy quickly drew an outpouring of love from fans. Certainly, Vanessa has been a proud mother with strong bonding with her kids.Recently, They partnered with @baby2baby and their Angel, @vanessabryant, to take part in a special Back-to-School Celebration for the incredible students of Ninth Street Elementary in Los Angeles. Each student received Mamba & Mambacita Sports Foundation gear along with Kobe sneakers — a perfect way to kick off the new school year and fall sports season.Also Read: Is Vanessa Bryant pregnant with her 5th child?

NEW DELHI: Indian cricket icons Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli were briefly removed from the ICC ODI batting rankings on Wednesday due to a technical glitch, despite both continuing to be active in the format.The error drew attention as Sharma had only recently climbed to the No. 2 spot in the ODI rankings last week, while Kohli was placed fourth with 736 rating points.

Minnesota relies on McCarthy-Jefferson duo to lead offensive charge



The Minnesota Vikings are entering the 2025 NFL season with a bold move, officially naming second-year quarterback J.J. McCarthy as their starter. With Sam Darnold departing in free agency, McCarthy now carries the weight of leading a team built to win immediately. The Vikings’ offensive roster is stacked with prime talent, including wide receiver Justin Jefferson, tight end T.J. Hockenson, and running back Jordan Mason, giving McCarthy a strong arsenal to launch a high-powered attack.As the Vikings focus on building chemistry, McCarthy has been working closely with Jefferson throughout training camp and preseason practices. Speaking to SiriusXM NFL Radio, the Michigan product praised Jefferson’s unique skill set and leadership on and off the field.“It’s a quarterback’s dream to have a receiver like that,” McCarthy said. “We got a lot of great guys in the room, too, but Justin’s one of one… His desire to work, his desire to be out there. He doesn’t have a cool guy personality; he’s just one of the boys. The way he moves is extremely freaky, just how he cuts in and out of routes.”McCarthy highlighted Jefferson’s speed, agility, and sideline awareness, saying his body control and stride length make him stand out from other receivers.Beyond physical ability, Jefferson’s mentality and confidence set him apart. “He has all those attributes all into one. What makes him great is just his mentality and his doglike mentality to show up every day, be the best in the world, and his confidence is through the roof,” McCarthy added.With Jefferson at 26, Hockenson at 29, and Mason at 26, the Vikings are in a position to maximize their prime offensive window. McCarthy and Jefferson are expected to form a dynamic duo for years, bridging experience with youthful talent. Minnesota’s front office is clear: this season is about competing at the highest level while establishing long-term chemistry between their quarterback and top playmakers.Also Read: Micah Parsons’ brother Terrence believes Cowboys star’s heart still belongs to Dallas amid contract drama As the 2025 season approaches, all eyes will be on McCarthy to see if he can translate his rapport with Jefferson into consistent on-field production.

In the coming time, it is possible that Gill will play in all three formats..The players who make the team win a match must not be left out. ..We have such a good team that we may win the Asia Cup .”Jaiswal has been placed on the standby list along with Prasidh Krishna, Washington Sundar, Riyan Parag and Dhruv Jurel.The Asia Cup is set to take place in the UAE from September 9 to 28, with India entering the tournament as defending champions.The squad also features Sanju Samson and Abhishek Sharma, who have built a strong reputation as an opening pair in T20Is over the past eight to ten months. However, with Gill expected to open, questions remain over Samson’s role at the top of the order.","India announce their squad for the Asia Cup 2025.

Paul Pierce tells how men should value loyalty over looks

Boston Celtics legend Paul Pierce has always been called The Truth, and now he is proving why. On his podcast this week, with co-host Azar Farideh beside him, he gave men advice that made people stop and think. He did not talk about basketball. He discussed relationships, choices, and life. His comments about women, ambition, and loyalty immediately became much discussed online and became one of the most discussed events of the day.On Tuesday, August 19, Paul Pierce joined his co-host Azar Farideh on the new episode of Truth After Dark. The show streamed online, and fans everywhere could tune in. At the 21:19 mark, Pierce paused and spoke with a serious face.“This is what I got to say today, and this has been on my mind,” Pierce said. He told men to stand tall, stay focused, and avoid being distracted. His tone was sharp. His message was simple. “Chest up, chin out, men. If you got ambition, if you are really grinding, leave these little pretty girls alone.”The clip quickly spread across social media. Fans cut short videos from the podcast and shared them on Instagram and X. Some laughed, some agreed, and some questioned the way he framed women by numbers.By the 22:57 mark of the podcast, Paul Pierce gave more details. He told men not to chase women only for looks. He said many look at Instagram and call a woman a nine or a ten. But, in his words, those ratings do not matter in real life.“Get you a five or a six,” Pierce said. “Maybe a seven. Someone who is going to put elbow into it. Someone who will be down for you 100 percent. Someone who will fight tooth and nail with you.”The 47-year-old Celtics champion explained that true value comes from women who stay when life gets hard. He said men should not just chase after beauty, but should also seek loyalty, effort, and heart. His honesty, as always, carried the same energy he showed on the court.The comments sparked fast reactions. One fan said: He Right Don’t Let These B******Fade You…2 Pac ..Can’t Fade MeOther one said: Old niggas tryna gatekeep the pretty women ain’t crazy ??Another fan said: It's crazy that it takes yall this old to realize this. I knew this was the game since I was in middle school.But no matter the views, his words reached thousands the same night. Clips continued to trend on X, and outlets like them reposted his lines.Paul Pierce, still known as “The Truth,” had once again spoken without filter. This time, it was not about basketball. It was about what he thinks men should value most in women.","Boston Celtics legend Paul Pierce has always been called The Truth, and now he is proving why.

Even though NBA 2K26 is still more than two weeks away from release, one gameplay clip has already taken center stage. Indiana Fever guard Caitlin Clark is seen flexing and celebrating by dunking over Los Angeles Lakers icon LeBron James in a promotional clip for the game that was made public on August 14. Meanwhile, a weekly podcast called Post Moves is produced by WNBA icons Candace Parker and Aliyah Boston. On their August 20 show, the duo talked about this widely shared video.There is a lot of anticipation for the NBA 2K26 game. It skyrocketed when they published a video of WNBA icon Caitlin Clark dunking over NBA legend LeBron James in a recent game ad. Furthermore, Candace Parker and Aliyah Boston discussed the trailer on Wednesday's episode of Post Moves.While both laughed during the sequence, Candace Parker jokingly stated that“LeBron’s PR team has got to get rid of that” clip, adding, “Not the King, c’mon man, you can’t do that to Bron.”They replayed the video game clip when Aliyah Boston stated that, if she were playing as the Indiana Fever in NBA 2K, she would rather play against the L.A. Lakers because of the clip of Caitlin Clark dunking on LeBron James. Candace Parker then added, ""This is wild right here!""She laughed and went on:""This is awful..

She went on to say that because of their dissimilar responsibilities and places, the comparison is unfair.

Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese are two of the league's most promising young players, but Candace feels that the never-ending argument has become pointless. The two-time MVP talked about it on Jemele Hill's show.She said:“I just think that it's like comparing apples and oranges.. Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese, it's like, what are we doing?

Caitlin Clark is reportedly hit with a bone bruise , adding to her groin injury



Indiana Fever are adjusting the roster amid mounting pressure



Caitlin Clark’s WNBA season has been anything but smooth. The Indiana Fever guard, who rarely missed a minute in college or her rookie year, is now facing her toughest stretch yet. As per a recent report, another injury has left her immediate future this season uncertain. With multiple setbacks piling up, the Fever’s playoff push is now being tested in ways few expected back in May.Caitlin Clark has not played since July 15, when she injured her right groin in the final minute of a road game at Connecticut. The setback comes after earlier issues with her left quad and left groin, making this her third soft-tissue injury of the year. She has now missed 22 games overall, including the last 13 straight, and even had to sit out the All-Star weekend in Indianapolis.Now, according to Indiana Fever beat reporter Scott Agness, Clark sustained a “very mild” bone bruise in her left ankle during an Aug. 7 workout in Phoenix. The injury will not alter her recovery schedule, as she remains sidelined while rehabbing her groin.Head coach Stephanie White admitted the team has no timetable for her return.“Until she can get into practice and until you guys see her in practice, it's really status quo,” White told reporters after Wednesday’s workout at Gainbridge Fieldhouse. The Fever are hoping she can recover in time for at least a portion of their final nine regular-season games, but nothing is guaranteed.This sudden streak of injuries is uncharted territory for the 23-year-old. Clark never missed a single game during her career at Iowa and played every contest for Indiana in 2024, a season that ended with her winning Rookie of the Year. Her durability had been one of her defining strengths, making her current absence even harder to grasp for fans.In the past two weeks alone, the team also lost three other key players to season-ending injuries, including Sophie Cunningham, who tore her MCL. Despite these setbacks, the Fever remain in sixth place at 19-16, holding on to a playoff position thanks to the depth the front office built around Clark last offseason.Her teammates insist her presence still matters, even from the sidelines. “Caitlin's still there, like that hasn't wavered,” guard Kelsey Mitchell said. “And I think even though they're not in the lineup, we still feel everyone's presence.”Clark’s frustration has been evident as well. Speaking on Sue Bird’s Bird’s Eye View podcast earlier this summer, she admitted, “I've never been through anything like this... It's been so hard.” White has echoed that caution is necessary, emphasizing that lingering muscle injuries often need the offseason to properly heal.Also Read: $6 billion-rich Mark Cuban credits one NBA insider for Dallas Mavericks’ acquisition of Kyrie Irving Clark, averaging 16.5 points and 8.8 assists per game when healthy, her relentless pace may be amplifying small strains into recurring problems.

Rashee Rice suspension twist as ESPN analyst Adam Schefter reveals why the ban may be shorter than fans feared,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/rashee-rice-suspension-twist-as-espn-analyst-adam-schefter-reveals-why-the-ban-may-be-shorter-than-fans-feared/articleshow/123412067.cms,"Rashee Rice suspension nears as NFL and NFLPA finalize the ban (Image via Getty)

Adam Schefter breaks down the NFL’s first move

CBA sets the ceiling for suspensions

NFLPA slows the process, not the league

Resolution is closer than fans think

What Rice’s suspension means for Kansas City

Rashee Rice’s name has lingered in the NFL’s disciplinary pipeline ever since his off-field crash in 2024 thrust him into a legal storm. Now, with the new season approaching, the Kansas City Chiefs wideout finds himself at the center of an intense back-and-forth between the league and the players’ union. ESPN analyst Adam Schefter has provided key updates that hint the suspension may be shorter than fans feared, shifting the spotlight from touchdowns to how many games Rice may miss when the final verdict arrives.Adam Schefter revealed that the NFL initially leaned toward an eight-game suspension for Rice, a number that quickly circulated online as speculation grew. Whispers of a harsher 10-game ban began dominating fan chatter, but Schefter pushed back, signaling that the league was already considering a lighter penalty. His update gave the first real sense of scale to the case, providing clarity after months of rumor.Central to the debate is the league’s own rulebook. Under the current Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA), suspensions in situations like Rice’s typically do not exceed six games. That precedent has become the measuring stick for both sides, creating a narrow window for negotiation. Schefter emphasized that while the NFL floated an eight-game figure, history shows that six has often been the ceiling, reshaping expectations for Chiefs fans holding their breath.Another key revelation from Schefter was the source of the delay. Contrary to popular belief, he clarified that the holdup was not from league offices dragging their feet. Instead, it was the NFL Players Association pushing for due process and carefully scrutinizing the case. “The wait isn’t on Park Avenue,” Schefter noted, referencing NFL headquarters, “it’s on the union’s side as they fight for terms within the CBA framework. ” His statement flipped the narrative, highlighting how labor rights remain deeply tied to player discipline.The timeline remains critical. With kickoff looming, both parties know a decision cannot spill too far into September. Schefter suggested that the case is “closer to the finish line than people think,” hinting that Rice will likely have clarity on his availability before the Chiefs begin defending their title push. The looming outcome is expected to be “closer to six than to three,” pointing to a middle-ground punishment — most likely five games.For the Chiefs, Rice’s fate carries both symbolic and strategic weight. His emergence in 2024 gave Patrick Mahomes another reliable weapon, and losing him for nearly half the season could bruise Kansas City’s offensive rhythm. At the same time, a shorter suspension would allow Rice to return early enough to keep the Super Bowl champions’ ambitions intact. Fans, already split between forgiveness and frustration, now wait on an announcement that could arrive any day.Rice’s case is more than a disciplinary footnote — it underscores how the NFL continues to wrestle with accountability, image, and fairness under its disciplinary code. For Schefter, the responsibility was to strip away rumor and lay out the mechanics of the process. For Rice, it is about rebuilding trust under the heaviest of spotlights. Whether five or six games, the suspension will be a reminder that the consequences of off-field choices linger long after the headlines fade.Also read: Travis Kelce’s locker room stunned and electrified as Taylor Swift turns up for Kansas City Chiefs’ Week 3 clash against Chicago Bears","Rashee Rice’s suspension is “closer to the finish line than people think,’ ESPN analyst Adam Schefter said.

Micah Parsons’ Dallas Cowboys future uncertain amid contract rumors



The Dallas Cowboys’ contract standoff with Micah Parsons continues to stir debate across the NFL, but the linebacker’s brother has stepped in with a message of reassurance for fans. While national reports suggest a split could be on the horizon, Terrence Parsons insists his brother still loves Dallas and has no desire to walk away.In the middle of swirling contract rumors, Parsons was spotted at practice this week, interacting with teammates and even sitting alongside Stephen Jones, the son of Cowboys owner Jerry Jones. Despite speculation of tension, Parsons has remained present with the team instead of holding out, a move that speaks volumes.Adding to that, Terrence Parsons posted on X after a video of his brother surfaced from Tuesday’s practice. He wrote, “I don’t think people realize how much Micah wanna be out there man.” The comment directly challenged the growing narrative that Parsons is preparing to leave the Cowboys.Longtime Cowboys insider Clarence Hill Jr. backed that sentiment, saying he does not believe Parsons wants a “divorce” from Dallas, echoing what fans have hoped to hear all offseason.Not everyone shares the same confidence. ESPN’s Adam Schefter suggested earlier this week that Parsons may not finish his career in Dallas, citing strained negotiations and ongoing uncertainty. On Unsportsmanlike, Schefter said, “There is a real possibility this could be the last year for Micah in Dallas.”That perspective has only fueled speculation about whether the Cowboys can keep their star defender long-term, or if a blockbuster move could eventually force him out of Dallas.Despite the outside noise, Parsons’ behavior tells another story. Many players in contract disputes skip practices or distance themselves from the team. Parsons, however, has continued showing up, staying engaged, and proving he wants to be part of the Cowboys’ defense this season.Also Read: San Francisco 49ers sign QB Nate Sudfeld to one-year deal, place RB Patrick Taylor on injured reserve With Terrence Parsons publicly insisting that Micah’s heart still belongs in Dallas, there’s reason for fans to believe the situation may not be as dire as some reports suggest.

Jake Paul is set to enter the ring for what could be the toughest test of his boxing journey yet. According to Ring Magazine’s Mike Coppinger, Paul will face reigning WBA lightweight champion Gervonta “Tank” Davis in an exhibition bout scheduled for November 15 at Atlanta’s State Farm Arena, streamed live on Netflix.“Jake Paul will face Gervonta Davis on Nov. 15 at Atlanta’s State Farm Arena in an exhibition on Netflix, sources confirm to @ringmagazine,” Coppinger posted on X. He added that talks for Paul to face Anthony Joshua fell through due to broadcast network issues.The weight limit for the contest remains undecided. Paul last competed at 200 pounds, while Davis holds his world title at 135 pounds. Coppinger noted that similar conditions might apply as when Floyd Mayweather fought Logan Paul in 2021: “When Floyd Mayweather faced Jake’s brother Logan in an exhibition, Mayweather couldn’t weigh more than 160 while Logan was capped at 190. Would expect some similar exhibition rules for weigh in here.”For Davis, who boasts a 30-0-1 professional record with 28 knockouts, this marks a departure from his usual competition. The 30-year-old fought to a draw with Lamont Roach Jr. in March after scoring emphatic stoppages over Ryan Garcia and Frank Martin. Facing Paul is a lucrative opportunity, though it is unlikely to enhance his legacy, especially as questions swirl about potential bouts against Shakur Stevenson or a Roach rematch.Paul, meanwhile, steps up from opponents like Julio César Chávez Jr. and ex-MMA fighters but may still face skepticism.

Who is Eberechi Eze?

Eberechi Eze is reportedly on the verge of joining Arsenal from Crystal Palace.

Arsenal are set to outmanoeuvre Tottenham Hotspur in securing Crystal Palace's Eberechi Eze for approximately £68 million, with the Gunners intensifying their interest following Kai Havertz's knee injury concern, according to reports on Wednesday in London.The 27-year-old England international, who was released by Arsenal at age 13, had been expected to join Spurs before Arsenal's late intervention matched Tottenham's proposed fee of £68 million ($91 million).Arsenal's pursuit of Eze gained momentum after Havertz experienced an injury setback, despite completing Sunday's match against Manchester United as a second-half substitute but missing Wednesday's open training session at the Emirates.Arsenal, who finished second to Liverpool in the Premier League last season, are looking to strengthen their title challenge while Spurs, despite winning the Europa League, narrowly avoided relegation with a 17th-place finish.Eze featured for 84 minutes in Palace's recent draw at Chelsea and participated in Wednesday's training ahead of their Conference League playoff against Fredrikstad.""Before Chelsea, I think many of you were surprised that Marc and Ebs started and played almost the whole game.Most of you will be surprised that they will start again tomorrow because of all the rumours. But again, they are committed,"" Palace coach Oliver Glasner stated at a pre-match press conference.""They are committed to the team, they have a contract here, they played a crucial part that we could be so successful, and they will play a crucial part as long as they are here. Because they are good, they are committed to the team, and when one of the players leave, which I don't know at the moment, then they want to leave as players who always gave 100 percent for Crystal Palace. This is what they did since they signed, and this is what we expect from them until the end of their contract, whenever this is. ""Palace captain Marc Guehi, who has also attracted interest from Liverpool, remains under contract until next year, while Eze's current deal runs until 2027.Glasner, who led Palace to Community Shield victory over Liverpool in a penalty shootout, addressed the ongoing transfer speculation.""This noise, these rumours, it's not just for three days, it's been written for weeks,"" Glasner remarked.",Eberechi Eze is reportedly on the verge of joining Arsenal from Crystal Palace. The 27-year-old England international was released by Arsenal at age 13.

Prince William & Kate Middleton's ‘Forever Home’ Dream Leaves Neighbours Homeless





Princess Anne turned 75 on August 15. To mark the day, the Prince and Princess of Wales posted a short birthday wish and shared her newly released portrait of the Princess Royal. Their message read, “Wishing Her Royal Highness The Princess Royal a very Happy 75th Birthday!”The image is part of a set released for the milestone. Shot at Gatcombe Park by John Swannell, the portrait keeps the tone formal and restrained—very Anne. Swannell has photographed her across multiple milestone birthdays, a continuity that suits the Princess Royal’s preference for understatement.There was also an earlier portrait released the week before: a two-shot of Anne with Sir Tim Laurence , taken at Windsor Castle by Chris Jackson ahead of July’s French state banquet. That image drew attention to a sleeker, pulled-back hairstyle, a look Anne also wore at the banquet with her longtime Festoon Tiara.The post from William and Kate landed during the family’s summer break, but the message stayed classic: a clear portrait, a brief line, and no long caption. It matches Anne’s public style and allows the picture to do the talking.As ever, the focus around her birthday was service. Anne is widely cited as one of the monarchy’s hardest-working royals, and official birthday coverage emphasized her decades of engagements and patronages.Family figured in the week’s imagery, too. The Windsor channels highlighted Anne and Sir Tim’s quiet partnership, as well as archival moments from her life—reminders of a career defined by duty, sport and charity more than spectacle.Why does a single post matter? It shows how the Wales household and the Princess Royal present milestones now: warm but minimal, with the visuals carrying the sentiment. For Anne, the emphasis stays on the work rather than the social-media flourish.As the summer break continues, the family is expected to spend time together in Scotland, with no indication of a large public event for the occasion. For the Princess Royal, a steady calendar and a modest celebration remain the norm—and the Waleses’ short message matched that mood.The takeaway: a milestone birthday, a clean portrait, and a brief wish from nephew and niece-in-law—small gestures that say plenty about how Princess Anne works, and how the royal family marks personal events today.","Princess Anne turned 75 on August 15.

Zara Tindall spent the weekend competing at the NAF Five Star International Hartpury Horse Trials in Gloucestershire. Beside the warm-up ring, her 11-year-old daughter Mia watched closely, smiled for photos, and reached up to stroke one of Zara’s horses. The small moments told their own story. Mia looks at home around the stables.Zara rode two familiar partners at Hartpury. She brought Showtime, known in the yard as “Cracker,” and Class Affair, nicknamed “Socks.” Between rounds, Mia stayed close, chatting with her mum and keeping an eye on the action. It was a simple family scene at a busy event.The outing fits a long family pattern. Zara is an Olympian who has spent most of her life around eventing. Her mother, Princess Anne, was the first royal to compete at the Olympics. Her late grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, was a lifelong horsewoman. Seeing Mia comfortable in that world feels natural, and it hints at a next chapter for the Tindalls’ eldest child.Crowd shots from Hartpury showed Mia following each phase and cheering from the ropes. She watched showjumping from close enough to see take-off strides and leaned forward during cross-country updates.Nothing about it felt forced. It looked like a child enjoying her mum’s sport.The event itself is a regular stop for Zara. It draws strong fields across levels and gives riders a good mid-season test. This year she balanced competition with being present for her daughter, and the cameras picked up that easy rhythm. A rider’s focus can be intense on show days. Zara still made space for quick smiles with Mia before heading back to the horsebox.There was also a small stable-side detail that fans loved. Mia reached up to pat Showtime and grinned as the horse flicked an ear toward her. Little gestures like that say more than any speech about where a child’s interests might lead. No one is mapping out her future, but comfort around horses often starts with moments like this.Zara has said before that all three of her children have been on a pony. That early exposure shows. Mia moved around the yard with confidence, giving the horses space when needed and stepping back when grooms asked. It is the kind of quiet horsemanship children pick up by being around good yards.Mother and daughter also offered a simple picture of support. When Zara finished a round, Mia was there. When the next phase approached, Mia made way so the team could work. For families who live the show circuit, that balance is familiar. It is how many young riders begin, watching first, riding later.The photos from Hartpury will add to Mia’s growing gallery of equestrian days out. For now, it is enough to see interest and joy. If she chooses to ride more in public, she will have a mother who understands the sport at the highest level and a family who know how to blend normal life with busy weekends on the road.Hartpury offered a gentle reminder of what this family values. Horses, routine, and time together. One weekend, two good horses, and a child who could not stop watching. That was the story from the rails, and it was easy to read.","Zara Tindall spent the weekend competing at the NAF Five Star International Hartpury Horse Trials in Gloucestershire.

Why are Israel’s football clubs playing in Serbia?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/why-are-israels-football-clubs-playing-in-serbia/articleshow/123421510.cms,".

Are sporting bans the answer?



Is UEFA becoming more political?



Must sporting chiefs take sides?







Though Maccabi Tel Aviv's name comes first on UEFA 's fixture list, neither they nor opponents Dinamo Kiev will be playing at home in their Europa League qualifier over successive Thursdays in August.While the clubs play domestic matches in Israel and Ukraine respectively, European football governors UEFA have deemed the countries unsafe for continental competition. As a result, the first leg on August 21 will be played in the TSC Arena in Backa Topola, Serbia, as were their previous European games this term. The team, like many other Israeli sporting clubs, has also played in Belgrade, with Serbia becoming a home away from home.Marko Begovic, an associate professor in sport management at Molde University in Norway and author of the book ""Sports Policy and Politics in the Western Balkans"" told DW there were three main reasons why Serbia ticked the necessary boxes.""Firstly, Serbia enjoys stable diplomatic relations with Israel and has a tradition of cooperation that makes such an arrangement politically viable. Second, Serbia maintains relative neutrality, exercising political ambiguity in these conflicts [the Middle East and Russia-Ukraine] and Belgrade represents a politically acceptable compromise in this regard.And the third is that Serbia possess the necessary sporting infrastructure. ""Serbia is not a member of NATO and Begovic said that, given the long-term policy aim of neutrality in international affairs, and the fact the population is much more concerned with the war between Russia and Ukraine than the one between Israel and Hamas, there are few objections to hosting Israeli teams.""If you look at the wider region, other republics of former Yugoslavia have been hosting Israeli clubs, not only in football, but in basketball as well. So it is not an issue. I would say this is part of institutional memory of the former Yugoslavia,"" he said.Part of that institutional memory is based in antipathy towards sporting sanctions for political or military actions. Yugoslavia, of which Serbia was a part, faced an almost total sporting ban in the early 1990s, which took in the Olympics, the football World Cup and all manner of other competitions.Russia is currently banned from all UEFA and FIFA tournaments but their national football team continue to play friendlies, generally against teams less hostile to their invasion of Ukraine, including a number of African sides and Serbia. The country is also banned from the Olympics, though some of their athletes compete under a neutral banner, and from a host of other international sporting competitions.Ukrainian sides like Dynamo Kiev are free to compete in most sports and will host the second leg at the Lublin Arena in Poland, with Ukraine's European club competition entrants playing at various venues across Europe.Palestine's national football team is recognized by FIFA and the athletes more broadly by the International Olympic Committee. Similarly Israel, as it stands, is still an active participant on the international sporting stage and will, for example, send a team to basketball's Eurobasket tournament that starts in September. The country sent a team to the Paris Olympics in 2024 and is to send athletes to the Winter Olympics in 2026.But a banner reading ""stop killing children, stop killing civilians"" was allowed by UEFA and held up by victims of current conflicts, including Palestinian children, at the recent UEFA Super Cup match between Paris Saint-Germain and Tottenham Hotspur in Udine, hinting at a more intense spotlight in the world's most popular sport.""For now, this is our decision. It is very difficult for me to comment on what could happen in the future,"" UEFA President Alexander Ceferin said in an interview with Slovenian public TV station Odmevi the day after the match, opening the door in the eyes of some for a potential ban. He added that the ""issue of Israel's participation in UEFA competitions is a legitimate question."" But Ceferin also re-iterated that ""in principle, I am not an advocate of not allowing athletes to compete,"" saying that the Russia ban had made little material difference.It's a position Begovic shares.""There has been a very selective approach in sanctioning and banning in sports,"" he explained. ""But either way, the [Ukraine] war is not any closer to an end. The same goes for other war zones. Banning and sanctioning sports will not bring wars to the end. Sports has a limit in that regard. I think sometimes we are expecting too much from sports.""But, for some, including the EU's sports commissioner, Glenn Micallef, allowing Israel to remain on the global sporting stage while they continue to exacerbate the dire situation in Gaza, is avoiding the issue.""When it comes to sports, I think there should be no space in sporting events for those who do not share our values,"" he told Politico, without directly naming Israel.""Sport is a tool that we use to promote peace, through which we promote human rights.""One could argue that this reading of sport's place within politics has been mostly absent in deed, if not in word, in recent years. Within the last two decades, football's World Cup has been hosted by Russia and Qatar, while Russia and China have hosted Olympic Games. In a world of significant geopolitical challenges, sporting organizations are increasingly forced into political decisions that most would rather avoid.","Maccabi Tel Aviv and Dinamo Kiev will not be playing at home in their Europa League qualifier.

A mission defined by resolve

“I dedicate this accomplishment to my country, the

UAE

, and to everyone who believes that willpower makes the impossible possible.”

Mount Elbrus: A formidable challenge

Preparation behind the summit

An inspiration for a generation





Emirati adventurer Rashid Ghanem Al Shamsi has successfully summited Mount Elbrus, Europe’s tallest mountain, enduring extreme weather conditions to raise the UAE flag at 5,642 metres above sea level.Rashid Al Shamsi’s ascent of Mount Elbrus, located in Russia’s southwestern Caucasus mountain range, came after navigating snowstorms, freezing temperatures, and rugged, icy terrain. The climb tested physical stamina and mental endurance, pushing through strong winds and challenging visibility across one of the world’s most notorious alpine environments.Al Shamsi dedicated his achievement to his country, stating:More than a physical feat, the ascent represented a symbolic journey. “The ascent was not only about reaching a geographic peak,” he added, “but also about achieving the peak of determination and resolve.”Mount Elbrus is a dormant volcano and part of the Seven Summits, a mountaineering challenge that includes the highest peak on each continent. Towering at 5,642 metres (18,510 feet), it holds the distinction of being the highest point in both Russia and Europe. Its two summits and unpredictable climate make it one of the most demanding climbs worldwide.Due to its elevation, extreme weather patterns, and terrain that shifts between ice, snowfields, and volcanic rock, Elbrus is widely regarded as a severe endurance test even for experienced mountaineers.Before attempting the climb, Al Shamsi committed several months to intense physical and logistical preparation. Training involved climbing smaller mountains and conditioning his body to withstand altitude and cold. He also undertook survival training in extreme weather and developed strategies to deal with known risks such as snowstorms and avalanches.A significant part of his readiness included studying Elbrus’s topography and weather systems in depth. His approach underlined the importance of not just courage, but also calculated planning, discipline, and adaptability in high-risk expeditions.Al Shamsi’s journey adds to a growing legacy of Emirati adventurers representing the UAE on global platforms. By reaching the highest geographical point in Europe and flying his nation’s flag there, he underscored the capability and spirit of the UAE’s youth.His achievement stands as both a national milestone and a personal triumph, reinforcing the message that focused preparation and unshakable willpower can overcome even the harshest physical and environmental barriers.","Emirati adventurer Rashid Ghanem Al Shamsi has successfully summited Mount Elbrus, Europe’s tallest mountain.

UAEFA takes a stand on referee criticism





Al Ain’s post match remarks spark controversy





Legal consequences and available alternatives





Match highlights and milestones from Al Ain vs Al Bataeh









The UAE Football Association has issued a firm directive to clubs after Al Ain FC publicly questioned refereeing decisions in their season-opening win. The Association underscored that legal steps will be taken against any party undermining match officials, marking a decisive move to safeguard the integrity of Emirati referees.The UAE Football Association (UAEFA) released a sharply worded statement warning clubs against challenging the competence or impartiality of match officials. The move follows comments made by Al Ain Football Club after their 2-1 win over Al Bataeh in the opening round of the 2024-25 ADNOC Pro League.According to the Association, any inappropriate public criticism of referees will lead to legal consequences. It emphasized that the authority for developing and overseeing the refereeing system lies solely with UAEFA and is managed through specialized committees and qualified professionals operating within structured frameworks.The statement also referenced a pattern of administrative missteps by Al Ain over the past two seasons. UAEFA said these were previously addressed with professionalism but added that it expects the club to focus on improving its internal processes and refrain from involving itself in areas outside its purview.The controversy began after Al Ain’s head coach, Vladimir Ivić, expressed frustration with the match officiating during his post-match press conference.The Serbian coach stated that his team had scored five times, with three goals disallowed. “For the first time in my career, I saw my team score five goals but the final result was 2-1. We definitely deserved more,” he said.The club also issued an official comment on its platforms, referring to “numerous controversial refereeing incidents” in the game. While affirming support for the domestic refereeing system, the club stated it “firmly rejects the continued occurrence of mistakes that could negatively affect the team’s results in domestic competitions.”In response, UAEFA criticized the tone and content of Al Ain's statements, highlighting the need for all clubs to uphold sportsmanship and show respect for the work of others in the football ecosystem.The Association confirmed that legal action will be initiated against Al Ain FC and any other individual or entity that publicly undermines match officials. It reiterated that complaints about officiating must be handled through formal channels, not public statements.As an alternative for clubs dissatisfied with domestic referees, UAEFA noted that there is an established mechanism for requesting foreign match officials. This provision, however, must be used through the proper channels and approvals.On the field, the match itself was notable beyond the controversy. Togolese striker Kodjo Fo-Doh Laba scored during first-half stoppage time, registering the 9,000th goal in ADNOC Pro League history — a significant milestone for the competition.Al Bataeh responded in the 69th minute with an equalizer from Uzbekistan international Azizjon Ganiev. However, Al Ain sealed their opening victory in the 82nd minute with a decisive header from Abdoul Karim Traoré.The match also marked the debut of Al Ain’s newly installed integrated cooling system at Hazza Bin Zayed Stadium. Over 300 air-conditioning units were operational to enhance fan comfort amid the UAE’s intense summer temperatures. Despite the off-field tensions, fans turned out in large numbers, with long queues at food outlets reflecting the growing attendance and engagement at league games.","UAE Football Association (UAEFA) issued a sharply worded statement warning clubs against challenging the competence or impartiality of match officials.

"Princess Anne's 75th birthday portrait: New hair, classic Festoon Tiara, and Sir Tim by her side",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/princess-annes-75th-birthday-portrait-new-hair-classic-festoon-tiara-and-sir-tim-by-her-side/articleshow/123234415.cms,"Chris Jackson/Getty Images for Buckingham Palace

Princess Anne is celebrating her 75th birthday with a fresh look and her signature sparkle. A new portrait released ahead of the milestone shows the Princess Royal standing alongside her husband, Vice Admiral Sir Tim Laurence. The photograph was taken before the French state banquet at Windsor Castle in July.The first thing people will notice is her hair. Anne has worn a similar bouffant style for about five decades. In this portrait she switches to a smooth chignon. It is elegant, neat, and suits the formal setting. The change is rare for her, which is why the photo drew quick attention.Tiara is the second talking point in this portrait. Anne chose the Festoon Tiara, a long-time favorite in her rotation. She received it as a gift in 1973 after christening a ship for the Worldwide Shipping Group. The design sits low and balanced, which works well with the new hair. Together they create a cleaner frame around her face.The portrait also doubles as a quiet nod to partnership. Sir Tim stands with her, as he often does at major state events. The two married in 1992 and keep a low profile. Their presence together in the birthday image sets a warm tone as family plans take shape for the coming weeks.There is context behind the timing. The palace shared the photo one week before her August 15 birthday to start the celebrations. It was shot by royal photographer Chris Jackson. He captured it at Windsor before the banquet held for the French state visit from July 8 to 10. The result is formal but relaxed, a look that fits Anne’s usual style.Fashion notes aside, the image also lands after a busy and challenging year. Anne remains one of the most active working royals by engagement count. Last year she briefly stepped back after a horse-related incident near her home. She returned to duties and later said the experience was a reminder that each day is a bonus. The new portrait, bright and composed, underlines that message without a single word.Reactions so far focus on two themes. Many like seeing a small style reset that still feels like Anne. Others appreciate the continuity of the Festoon Tiara, a piece linked to her early twenties and worn across decades. It is a simple mix of new and old. That balance is what people expect from her.As the birthday week begins, more pictures and appearances are likely. For now, one frame does the job. New hair. A classic tiara. Her husband at her side. It is a quiet portrait that still says a lot about how Anne works, dresses, and shows up for the role she has held for most of her life.","Princess Anne is celebrating her 75th birthday with a fresh look and her signature sparkle.

The question of whether Prince Andrew should be stripped of his titles has resurfaced ahead of the publication of Andrew Lownie's new biography.The book, entitled The Rise and Fall of the House of York, has been exclusively serialised by the Daily Mail following four years of research and hundreds of interviews. Lownie revealed a series of the York family's secrets, ranging from Prince Andrew's unusual sexual habits to Sarah Ferguson's association with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.""There is very little that the Royal Family can actually do when it comes to Prince Andrew,"" said Daily Mail's Editor-at-Large Richard Kay on the latest episode of ""Palace Confidential.""""He's been effectively sacked. He's the only royal prince who has been sacked from public life that I can think of. ""Short of sending him far, far away - and who would want him? - I think it's very insulting when I keep reading suggestions of sending him to the Falkland Islands. Do the people there particularly want Prince Andrew? I doubt it very much.""So it's difficult to know what to do with him. He's just going to be there. They have managed it fairly well. He doesn't have any kind of public role. ""What about stripping him of everything? Well, he was born a prince, and he was given a dukedom.""The one thing they could possibly do would be to remove the dukedom, but I think it would have to come through parliament, and I can't see any government of any shade wanting to get involved in anything like this. It would open up a real can of worms.""So far, just six per cent of readers have responded 'no' to the question. Richard stars on the hit YouTube panel show alongside Daily Mail's Diary Editor Richard Eden and Royal Editor Rebecca English.Rebecca, who has covered the royal beat for the Daily Mail since 2004, added: ""It's a hugely tricky one for them because he is there and he exists. They can't airbrush him out - he is a member of their family."" In an exclusive interview in the latest edition of the Daily Mail's royal newsletter, ""Palace Confidential"", Lownie stated he contacted over 3,000 former school contemporaries, staff, colleagues, and associates of the couple. ""Of whom 300 spoke to me,"" Lownie said.""Some on the record, but most off. ""They felt it was time to challenge the York family’s carefully curated narrative. It is difficult because there tends to be a code of silence about the royals (no one wants to be cast out of the privileged circle).""Additionally, their staff have to sign NDAs, royals are not fully subject to the Freedom of Information Act and there are strict limits on what questions MPs can ask about them in Parliament. ""I could also add the letters I received threatening to sue me, before a word of the manuscript had been seen. Charming people.""In the ""Palace Confidential"" episode, Richard Kay pointed out that within the Royal Family, there is an instinct to ""circle the wagons and protect one of their own"".He added: ""Their first response in all these cases is 'Oh, it's just the press, it's the media.' This is different. This is a graphic book written by a figure who has some substance in the writing he has done. ""You can't just brush this away."" Having covered the royal beat for more than 20 years, Richard Eden shared his views on whether Andrew should be stripped of his titles.He said: ""Certainly, what the King could do, and something that I have advocated for a long while, is strip him of his role as a Counsellor of State. ""He and Prince Harry still have the legal right to deputise for the King. That could easily be stripped from them, as well as his title of Duke of York or other things if they wanted to.""He is still in the line of succession. Yes, it would take an Act of Parliament, but that's no big deal. ""The King did it recently when he extended the list of Counsellors of State to include Princess Anne and Prince Edward. It could be done very easily indeed.""That's something which I would strongly suggest he does."" Elsewhere in the episode, the panel discussed the possibility of Prince William taking ""decisive action"" regarding aspects of the monarchy in the coming years.","Andrew Lownie's new biography, The Rise and Fall of the House of York, has been exclusively serialised by the Daily Mail. The book reveals a series of the York family's secrets, ranging from Prince Andrew's unusual sexual habits to Sarah Ferguson's association with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Daily Mail's Editor-at-Large Richard Kay said there is very little the Royal Family can actually do when it comes to Prince Andrew.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123201868,imgsize-51336,width-400,resizemode-4/123201868.jpg"
Marching in the name of legacy: Sikh regiment debate rekindled in Britain,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/marching-in-the-name-of-legacy-sikh-regiment-debate-rekindled-in-britain/articleshow/123097673.cms,"Marching in the name of legacy: Sikh regiment debate rekindled in Britain





The debate over whether there should be a Sikh Regiment in the British Armed Forces has resurfaced but the ministry of defence (MOD) insists there are no such plans.The debate was triggered after Lord Sahota asked defence minister Lord Coaker in the House of Lords on 7 July whether there was any progress of having a Sikh regiment in the British Army, given the loyalty of Sikh soldiers in both world wars. Coaker replied, “Let me consider that request from my noble friend. I am quite happy to meet him to see what more we can do to recognise the contribution of soldiers such as Sikhs.” This led to UK headlines such as ‘Minister open to British Army Sikh regiment proposal.’But MOD sources told TOI, “Over the years, there have been conversations about this, but it would breach Britain’s anti-discriminatory laws. There are no current plans for a Sikh regiment as it goes against the Equality Act. We want to do something to recognise Sikh contributions in some way, but not through a Sikh regiment.”Lord Sahota, whose grandfathers served in the British Indian army, including the 15Punjab Regiment, told TOI: “I don’t think it would go against the Equality Act.”He pointed out the British Army has had the Staffordshire regiment and currently has the Brigade of Gurkhas, the Royal Yorkshire Regiment, the Royal Welsh and Royal Regiment of Scotland and so on.“It doesn’t mean other faiths like Hindus, Muslims or Christians wouldn’t be able to serve in a Sikh Regiment. If you are in the Royal Regiment of Scotland, it doesn’t mean you have to be Scottish.”.“We are struggling to recruit ethnic minorities in this country,” he said, and so having a Sikh Regiment would give Sikhs a “reason to join.” “They would wear turbans and have beards and it would reflect Sikh heritage and values,” he said.“It would foster a better relationship with other countries such as India and South Asia as well,” he added.There are estimated to be only 200 Sikhs in the British Armed Forces currently.“People tend to go into the army if their grandfather was in it. Sikhs don’t have that role model here,” Sahota said. He said if there was a Punjab or Sikh Regiment, they would have that role model. “There are more than 700k Sikhs in the UK. I am sure quite a few would be prepared to follow in their great grandfather’s footsteps. King Charles even told a Sikh soldier he wanted to see more Sikhs in the British Army,” the Labour life peer added.India-born Sahota (74) said he plans to meet Lord Coaker after the summer recess and will take Sikhs in the British Army and MPs with him.Preet Kaur Gill MP, who has met the armed forces minister many times, to raise the issue, said: “The ministers are looking at doing something. No decision has been made. It is being looked at. There have been existing Sikh regiments in the army. It’s not anything new.”The modern Indian army has a Sikh Regiment, which continues to recruit from the Sikh community and a Punjab Regiment. The Sikh regiment is one of the most decorated regiments and traces its origins to the first Sikh battalion raised by the East India Company in 1846.But veteran army reservist Captain Jay Singh-Sohal OBE is against the idea.“Even if they did this they wouldn’t fill out a regiment with recruits - we struggle with getting young Sikhs into the military as it is. A Sikh regiment isn’t going to change this and would become massively understaffed. A single battalion regiment requires 700 plus. A Sikh regiment will fail as it won’t get 700 plus young Sikhs joining. And if the answer is to look beyond Sikhs then what’s the point of a race specific regiment?” he said.“These British Sikh politicians need to make the argument for the benefit of Sikh specific regiments in the context of the threats we face today,” Sohal added. “It’s not about harking to past glories but about practical ways in which Sikhs today can make an impact through military service. I believe Sikhs do make an impact as we serve alongside those who represent Great Britain as a whole,” Johal said.“The Sikh identity is already recognised as a strength in the British Army and protected by UK law. We don’t need special treatment. We already practice our faith in the army. A modern army is about bringing capabilities and insights from different walks of life and backgrounds to create a synergy into a whole team setting. Sikhs can contribute a lot to that. Having a Sikh specific regiment won’t motivate more youngsters to join. What would, is if they see value in soldiering or developing themselves as a leader through military experience. I challenge Preet Gill and Lord Sahota to find me 20 Sikhs willing to sign up to the British Army right now, regardless of whether we have a Sikh regiment or not. They won’t be able to do it.”Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi MP, chair of the defence committee, which scrutinises the work of the MOD, said: “Given the extraordinary history, martial traditions and sacrifices of Sikh soldiers, especially during both world wars, I have supported the establishment of a British Sikh Regiment for several years, including meetings with ministers and other activists.""""While the campaign has not achieved success thus far, we will certainly continue to make the case"", Dhesi added."," debate over whether there should be a Sikh Regiment in the British Armed Forces has resurfaced.

Harry's olive branch







Prince Harry has agreed to share his official diary with the royal family to avoid clashes in public appearances and ease ongoing tensions.The move comes after his recent trip to Angola made headlines for revisiting princess Diana’s iconic anti-landmine walk, on the same day Queen Camilla's 78th birthday portrait was released. Harry’s photos reportedly overshadowed the coverage of the Queen’s milestone, which did not go down well with the palace.According to The Mail, Harry is now open to “deconflicting” his schedule with other senior royals, including Prince William’s team at Kensington palace.Their PR teams have reportedly kept in touch since private talks began earlier this year. In fact, aides from both camps were seen meeting at a London members club earlier this month.Harry is also quietly pushing for a more personal reconnection with his father. According to royal expert Hilary Fordwich, King Charles remains “cautious and wary” of Harry’s recent efforts. She said ,“Harry misses the UK and many aspects of royal life, but his return risks more disclosures, and that worries the family,” she added.Royal biographer Tom Bower told The Mirror that Harry is “seriously worried” about being permanently shut out.“He’s afraid that once Charles is gone, William will banish him from the UK entirely,” Bower said.This fear reportedly led to a discreet meeting at the Royal Over-Seas League in London last week. Harry’s aides flew in to meet King Charles’ top communications official, Tobyn Andreae. Witnesses said the two teams chatted on the garden terrace before moving indoors. Though there was no set agenda, both sides “had things to talk about”.","Prince Harry has agreed to share his official diary with the royal family to avoid clashes in public appearances and ease ongoing tensions.

Sophie Cunningham slapped with fine for speaking out on Paige Bueckers

What was Sophie Cunningham’s TikTok controversy ?

WNBA player Sophie Cunningham is well-known for her outspoken and blunt nature in the league. She loves controversies. Days before, the Indiana Fever star was fined $500 for a TikTok video that went viral. However, her sarcastic response only felt like she was being unapologetic. Well, to some, it might seem like the situation was dropped. However, the Fever star had to pay a heavy penalty for speaking out about the “truth” as she claimed. She made a bold statement on Paige Bueckers and how the referees gave quite a preferential treatment to her. Her statement earned her yet another fine, marking the third time something like this had occurred.In a recent series of events, Indiana Fever player Sophie Cunningham faced a backlash as she was again fined for making a bold statement about Paige Bueckers. “I love Paige to death... but those refs were giving her every frickin' whistle last night... Literally you couldn't touch her... That sh*t is so annoying”, said Sophie Cunningham. She also said that she doesn’t hold anything against Paige Bueckers, but the referees were prioritizing her and playing the favoritism card.Sophie Cunningham had criticized the annoying whistle that the Wings guard Paige Bueckers had received against the Fever. On her recent podcast, she said, “I’m officially 3-for-3 on being fined by the WNBA,"" Cunningham said on her latest podcast episode. ""They didn't like my comments on Paige Bueckers. I didn't even say anything bad!” This was because she had already been fined twice earlier for her profound controversies.Sophie Cunningham is already famous for her well-known controversies, and things just keep adding up against her. Earlier in July, the Indiana Fever player was slapped with a fine of $500 for a major controversy that spread through TikTok. She had criticized the referees in a mocking tone. In that video, she was seen lip-syncing to Sabrina Carpenter’s “Manchild”, using the lyrics, “Stupid, or is it slow? Maybe it’s useless”, perfectly paring it with a hilarious caption, “@ some refs”.This video went viral on social media and sparked heated debates among the fans. Within no time, the WNBA player was fined $500. She said, “Idk why this is funny to me…like ok you got it bud! Cause there is not more important things to be worried about with our league right now”, her response dropped another bomb just at the right time.Also read: Sophie Cunningham Fined $500 by WNBA for Controversial TikTok Criticizing Referees, Sparks Debate on League Priorities","Sophie Cunningham slapped with fine for speaking out on Paige Bueckers.

NEW DELHI: World champion D Gukesh was held to a draw by American wild card Samuel Sevian, while fellow Indian R Praggnanandhaa also split the point with Uzbekistan’s Nodirbek Abdusattorov in the third round of the Sinquefield Cup.For Praggnanandhaa, it was a second consecutive draw, but enough to keep him in the leading pack of three players alongside Fabiano Caruana of the United States and overnight co-leader Levon Aronian, the Armenian-born American.Caruana produced the only decisive result of the day, defeating France’s Alireza Firouzja, who suffered his first loss of the tournament. Aronian was held by Maxime Vachier-Lagrave of France, while Wesley So (USA) and Poland’s Jan-Krzysztof Duda also drew their encounter.After three rounds in the $375,000 prize money event, Praggnanandhaa, Aronian, and Caruana share the lead with two points apiece. A half-point behind them are So, Firouzja, Vachier-Lagrave, Sevian, and Gukesh. Duda is next on one point, while Abdusattorov finally opened his account with half a point from three games.For Gukesh, the first draw of the tournament came relatively smoothly with the black pieces. Sevian opted for the Rossolimo Variation against the Sicilian Defence, but the Indian teenager was always in control.The middle game passed without major complications as pieces were exchanged regularly, leading to an inevitable drawn endgame.Praggnanandhaa, playing with black for the first time after two whites, chose the Nimzo-Indian Defence. Abdusattorov, still searching for form, was unable to make much of an impression. The game simplified into an opposite-coloured bishops ending where neither side could press for more than a draw.The highlight of the round, however, was Caruana’s clinical positional win over Firouzja. Using the Fianchetto Variation against the Nimzo, Caruana secured a spatial advantage and better piece coordination in the middle game. After steady pressure, he pushed his central passed pawn to the seventh rank to seal the victory.With Grand Chess Tour finals spots on the line later this year, Caruana acknowledged the importance of the win. The American noted that while Vachier-Lagrave is almost assured of qualification, the rest of the field is still battling for the remaining places.Results round 3: Nodirbek Abdusattorov (Uzb, 0.5) drew with R Praggnanandhaa (Ind, 2) Fabiano Caruana (Usa, 2) beat Alireza Firouzja (Fra, 1.5); Duda Jan Kryzstof (Pol, 1) drew with Wesley So (Usa, 1.5); Maxime Vachier-Lagrave (Fra, 1.5) drew with Levon Aronian (Usa, 1.5) Samuel Sevian (Usa, 1.5) drew with D Gukesh (Ind, 1.5).","World champion D Gukesh was held to a draw by American wild card Samuel Sevian.

India Asia Cup squad press conference: What Ajit Agarkar, Surya said on shocking calls

Poll Do you believe Shubman Gill will become a successful captain for India? Yes, definitely No, not likely

NEW DELHI: Renowned astrologer Greenstone Lobo has made bold predictions about Shubman Gill ’s future as a player and captain, stating that while the young opener has a “phenomenal horoscope” and will emerge as a run-machine for India, his leadership might not immediately bring major ICC trophies.Speaking in an exclusive video with TimesofIndia.com, Lobo explained:“Shubman Gill is a reigning superstar of Indian cricket. So how are his stars placed in the next 4 to 5 years? How is he going to fare as a player, as a captain for India, for his franchise is what I am going to talk about in this video. So talking about Shubman Gill, he has a phenomenal horoscope.”Lobo clarified that Gill’s exact year of birth — 1997 or 1999 — is uncertain, but regardless, his astrological chart is extremely powerful.“He could be either born in 1997 or in 1999. So sometimes whatever you see on the internet may not be true. So he has got a phenomenal chart irrespective of whichever date he is born in. And he has got all the asteroids very powerful. He has got a Pluto in grey lizard. See Pluto in grey lizard avatar belongs to a person who will overcome the biggest of challenges and become victorious.”Lobo cited Gill’s leadership in recent series wins as an early example of this.“And we have already seen the glimpse of what exactly that means. So 2-1 and series 1 was online and inspired leadership. Of course there were so many other factors but leadership of Shubman definitely played a role and he went on to make it 2-0. That was an awesome thing, right? So now the question is, did the selectors do the right thing by making him a captain? Yes, he has made it absolutely clear that yes it was the right thing. ”However, Lobo was cautious about Gill’s suitability as ODI captain in the near term.“Now the question is, will the Indian selectors, will they go on and make Shubman Gill the captain of even the ODI team? And of course he is already a designated vice captain. But can he become the captain? And also what will happen if he becomes the captain of the T20 team? It’s a big question that I am going to answer now.”He explained that historically, captains with strong planetary alignment in the 7th house — such as MS Dhoni and Rohit Sharma — succeeded in winning trophies.“See, to beat enemies in sports and that too at the highest level, then you need some extraordinary horoscope. So for example if you are looking at somebody like MS Dhoni or it can be Rohit Sharma, both of them had the strongest planet in their chart used to be in the 7th house. 7th house means beating enemies. Now the question is, does Shubman Gill have that? Okay, we don’t know his exact birth details… But he has already become a captain and he is a great player. ”Lobo believes Gill’s peak success as captain could come only after 2031.“The point is, at this point of time, whatever planetary positions are, they are largely favouring people who would be in the mid 90s. Shubman Gill is born in the late 90s… Captains born during these times will only win the major trophies. So if he becomes the ODI captain, I would say that’s not a good idea. That wouldn’t be very good for India. I am not talking about long term… Probably the 2031 World Cup would be a better time for Shubman Gill to win a major trophy. ”He even issued a plea to the selectors.“I mean, please. Okay, all the selectors, if anybody is listening. Ajit Agarkar , Gautam Gambir, please, please, please. You are only killing the chances of India to win the World Cup. It is going to be something massive… And we want the right captain. And the right captain would be… Anyone born between 93 to 94. Even 92 is also okay. Some good player, born during that time, should be made the ODI captain.”While hesitant about Gill captaining ODIs or T20Is immediately, Lobo was firm that the young star’s batting would flourish.“Because, you know, Shubman has got a phenomenal horoscope. He is going to play well. He is going to keep on playing. He is going to be rocking and he is going to do all this. He is going to pile on the runs. And what will happen is, it will put a lot of pressure on the selectors and maybe he may become the captain… He is going to be a run machine. You wouldn’t miss Virat Kohli much because this guy is there.”Lobo predicted Gill’s combination with head coach Gautam Gambhir would be particularly effective in bilateral series.“You can actually see Shubman will keep piling runs. See, on a one-on-one combat, okay, let’s say that bilateral series, you know, he is going to Australia, he is going to Siena countries. It may be difficult, but then he may create real good records there. So, his combination with Gautam Kampir is going to work wonders, especially in one-on-one battles.”However, he warned that winning ICC trophies would be a tougher task for Gill, at least in the short term.“But if you are talking about winning an ICC trophy, the ICC trophy is always a multi-team tournament, where he is going to have challenges. Probably, he can win an IPL, okay, but winning a World Cup or winning some huge ICC trophy at the highest level, something like a WTC, that’s going to be very, very difficult for Shubman. At least, not immediately. Long run, yes. After four years, yes. Immediately, the next two, three ICC trophies, okay, I just hope that selectors make the right decisions. ”","Renowned astrologer Greenstone Lobo has made bold predictions about Shubman Gill’s future as a player and captain.

Bill Gates reveals his winning answer to ‘why should we hire you’ to crack any interview,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/bill-gates-reveals-his-winning-answer-to-why-should-we-hire-you-to-crack-any-interview/articleshow/123405257.cms,"

Bill Gates answers why should we hire you?

What are your strengths and weaknesses?





Where do you see yourself in five years?



What are your salary expectations?







Bill Gates’ final advice

When it comes to cracking a job interview, even the brightest candidates often stumble on the most common questions. Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates , who has not only given interviews in his youth but also conducted countless ones as an employer, recently shared how to approach some of the trickiest questions that appear in almost every interview. Gates believes that while technical skills matter, the way candidates express their motivation, adaptability, and problem-solving abilities makes a lasting impression. His advice offers a mix of honesty, preparation, and strategic thinking that can help job seekers stand out in today’s highly competitive hiring environment.Gates emphasizes that this question isn’t about boasting but about clearly communicating your value in a way that resonates with the employer. He explains that hiring managers are not just looking for a list of accomplishments – they want to see how your skills and mindset directly align with the company’s mission and challenges. Instead of giving vague responses like “I work hard” or “I’m a team player,” Gates suggests tailoring your answer to highlight the exact strengths the employer is seeking. For example, if the role demands innovation, a candidate could describe a time when they creatively solved a difficult problem and how that approach could benefit the company.As an example, Gates himself often pointed to his coding achievements, deep passion for software, teamwork skills, and ambition when answering this question during his early career. By showcasing not only what he had already accomplished but also his enthusiasm and hunger to grow, he left interviewers convinced of his long-term potential. He advises modern candidates to take a similar approach: connect your unique skills directly to the company’s needs, show you are motivated to grow with the role, and position yourself as someone who can contribute to both short-term impact and long-term vision.According to Gates, this question is an opportunity for self-awareness rather than self-promotion. He recommends that candidates choose strengths that are relevant to the job while explaining how those qualities have produced real results in the past. On weaknesses, Gates suggests honesty balanced with growth – admitting areas of improvement while showing the steps you are taking to overcome them. This demonstrates maturity and a willingness to learn, qualities employers value highly.Bill Gates’ own answer: Gates admitted that he was not particularly skilled in marketing or sales, but he excelled in product creation and defining features. By acknowledging weaknesses without trying to disguise them, while doubling down on his true strengths, Gates showed the kind of critical self-awareness employers value.Gates points out that this question is less about predicting the future and more about revealing ambition. Employers want to see that candidates have direction and drive. He suggests aligning your career goals with the company’s growth, showing that you want to grow alongside the organization. Even if the long-term vision evolves, demonstrating that you think ahead and are motivated to build a future leaves a strong impression.On this tricky question, Gates advises candidates to strike a balance between confidence and flexibility. Being too rigid about salary can make you seem difficult to work with, while undervaluing yourself may raise doubts about your worth. Gates recommends doing prior research on industry standards and giving a reasonable range instead of a fixed number. He also stresses framing salary discussions in terms of value – how your skills and contributions justify the compensation – while showing openness to negotiation. This demonstrates professionalism and practicality, traits employers respect.For Gates, interviews are not just about answering questions but about telling a story – one that highlights your passion, your potential, and your fit with the company’s culture. He encourages candidates to prepare, practice, and remain authentic, reminding them that the goal is not perfection but connection. By framing common questions as opportunities to reveal character and ambition, Gates believes any candidate can turn a stressful interview into a powerful career breakthrough.","Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates offers advice on how to answer the most common interview questions.

India Asia Cup squad: Why Shreyas Iyer and Shubman Gill are biggest talking points

NEW DELHI: Former India opener Aakash Chopra has expressed surprise at Shreyas Iyer ’s exclusion from the reserve players list for the upcoming Asia Cup , pointing out that it doesn’t send the right message regarding his T20I future.Iyer, who piled up 604 runs at a strike rate of 175 in IPL 2025 while leading Punjab Kings to the runners-up spot, had shown marked improvement against the short ball and dominated spinners throughout the tournament. Yet, he found no place in either the 15-member squad for the Asia Cup or the five-man reserves list.The omission had earlier baffled former India assistant coach Abhishek Nayar, and now Chopra has voiced similar concerns. ""Shreyas' name is not even there in the five reserves, and that is surprising. It's understandable that you couldn't have him in the 15 as you can't play him in the XI, and you wanted lower-order batters as backup, where Shivam Dube is there, and Rinku Singh will be given another chance, which is absolutely par for the course.""However, a place could have been created in the reserve players at least, where you have kept Dhruv Jurel, Yashasvi Jaiswal and Prasidh Krishna. Shreyas’ name could have been there, but you haven't kept it there either, and that doesn't send a great signal. The clarity in front of Shreyas' name is completely not there,"" Chopra said on his YouTube channel on Wednesday.At the same time, Chopra believes Iyer’s international future is far from over and that he still has a pathway to the 2026 Men’s T20 World Cup if he maintains strong performances in ODIs.For now, Iyer’s immediate focus will be on representing West Zone in the Duleep Trophy, which marks the start of the 2025/26 domestic season.""Shreyas Iyer not being there is a big story. What more will Shreyas Iyer have to do? What more can you do than what you have already done? You had a 600-plus run IPL season, took the team to the final, scored runs in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, played Ranji, and won the Champions Trophy. That's all you can do as a human being.""This is the Asia Cup team. Don't attach the World Cup with it because there are 15 T20Is after this. The world changes in 15 T20Is. If he keeps scoring runs in ODIs, sooner or later, Shreyas Iyer will be part of the team. I have a strong feeling that Shreyas Iyer will be a part of India's T20 World Cup team,"" he added.",Former India opener Aakash Chopra has expressed surprise at Shreyas Iyer ’s exclusion from the reserve players list for the upcoming Asia Cup. Iyer piled up 604 runs at a strike rate of 175 in IPL 2025 while leading Punjab Kings to the runners-up spot. Chopra believes Iyer's international future is far from over and that he still has a pathway to the 2026 Men’s T20 World Cup.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123404197,imgsize-29990,width-400,resizemode-4/123404197.jpg"

India Asia Cup squad: Why Shreyas Iyer and Shubman Gill are biggest talking points

NEW DELHI: The announcement of India’s Asia Cup squad on Tuesday has ignited intense debate, with Ajit Agarkar and his panel facing scrutiny over the omission of proven performers like Shreyas Iyer, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Mohammed Siraj and Prasidh Krishna. One of the most polarising decisions has been the inclusion of Kolkata Knight Riders pacer Harshit Rana.Former India opener Aakash Chopra has questioned the logic behind Rana’s selection, arguing that his record does not justify a place in the 15-member squad.“Harshit Rana’s case is very interesting. His case needs to be discussed because he came as a concussion replacement for Shivam Dube once, picked up three wickets as well, and became the Player of the Match, which was brilliant, but what about before and after that?” Chopra asked on his YouTube channel.Rana’s IPL 2025 season was underwhelming, with 15 wickets at an economy rate of 10.18. Beyond that single standout international performance against England, Chopra felt the numbers painted a less convincing picture.“The last IPL was extremely ordinary. His performances have not been very good. His numbers are not flattering. It doesn’t seem like his numbers are strong enough to deserve a place in the side,” he said.Chopra also downplayed Rana’s chances of featuring prominently in the tournament. “The truth is also that he won’t get to play all matches. In fact, he might get to play even one match when Bumrah isn’t available. If he isn’t getting a chance to play, you say that whoever is sitting out doesn’t make a difference.”The former batter argued that Krishna, who won the IPL 2025 Purple Cap, and Siraj, with his recent form in England, were more deserving candidates. “You will find that Prasidh Krishna should have got a chance, or you could have thought about rewarding Mohammed Siraj, but the team has once again gone towards Harshit,” he concluded.",Aakash Chopra questions inclusion of Harshit Rana in India's Asia Cup squad. Former India opener says Rana's record does not justify a place in the 15-member squad. Chopra believes Prasidh Krishna and Mohammed Siraj are more deserving candidates.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123414672,imgsize-15958,width-400,resizemode-4/123414672.jpg"
