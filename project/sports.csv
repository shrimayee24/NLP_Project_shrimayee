I had an abdomen injury as well. I am ageing. To come into the tournament from Test cricket was difficult, I needed some time to get that bowling rhythm. But once you have committed to your franchise, you want to go through with the season,"" Ashwin said.Ashwin praised the team's bowling performance, highlighting Trent Boult 's ability to generate swing and seam movement, which played a pivotal role in their victory. He also noted the favorable bowling conditions due to the lack of dew in the second innings.""We hit the right lengths while bowling, and Trent Boult got some swing and seam movement. There wasn't much dew in the second innings, which helped,"" Ashwin commented.Acknowledging the team's recent struggles and the absence of key player Jos Buttler , who returned to England for an international series, Ashwin expressed confidence that the win would boost their morale ahead of Qualifier 2.""The team was not doing well in the past few games and we had lost our opener Jos Buttler. But this win will give us confidence ahead of the qualifier two clash,"" he added.Ashwin also highlighted the team's blend of youthful energy and experienced players as their greatest strength, praising Shimron Hetmyer and Rovman Powell for their contributions.""I think there were some exceptional shots from our boys to get that chase. Our greatest strength is the exuberance of youth and the experience we have to support that. Now that Hettie (Shimron Hetmyer) is back in, and Rovman got a few boundaries today as well. We've got Keshav sitting outside. We have the right momentum for this team going forward,"" he concluded.As RR move forward in the IPL playoffs, Ashwin's return to form and the team's regained momentum offer a promising outlook for their upcoming challenges.",Ravichandran Ashwin admits to struggling with form and fitness in first half of IPL 2024 season.

NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli has gone on record more than once that he will never play for any other team in the Indian Premier League ( IPL ) except Royal Challengers Bengaluru ( RCB ).RCB had bought Virat Kohli for a price of USD 30,000 for the 2008 IPL after he led India to victory in the 2008 U19 World Cup.In the 2008 IPL auction, Delhi Daredevils (now Capitals) had a chance to go for Kohli but they opted for Pradeep Sangwan, a left-arm pacer, to beef up their bowling unit and then RCB bought Kohli.In all these years, RCB have failed to win the IPL trophy since 2008 even though they have reached the final thrice - in 2009, 2011 and 2016, but Virat has stuck to his words and has remained loyal to the franchise.In 2008, RCB was co-owned by Vijay Mallya and ahead of the team reaching the playoffs after a remarkable turnaround, Mallya sent across his best wishes to the team and Virat.Mallya posted on X, ""When I bid for the RCB franchise and I bid for Virat, my inner instinct told me that I could not have made better choices. My inner instinct tells me that RCB have the best chance to go for the IPL Trophy. Onward and Upward. Best of luck.""After a poor start to IPL 2024, RCB won six consecutive games to qualify for the playoffs.RCB take on Rajasthan Royals in the Eliminator on Wednesday and if they win, they will play Sunrisers Hyderabad in Qualifier 2 for a spot in the final where they will meet Kolkata Knight Riders","RCB bought Virat Kohli for a price of USD 30,000 for the 2008 IPL.

BENGALURU: Amid a sea of noisy spectators in Ahmedabad on Wednesday night, Virat Kohli cut a distraught, lonely figure after Royal Challengers Bengaluru 's title hopes were again dashed on Wednesday night.Rajasthan Royals had just handed them a four-wicket defeat in the Eliminator, and 'King' Kohli, broken and disappointed, was left to ponder what might have been as he walked up to the wicket and knocked over the bails.He had done the same thing on a muggy November 19 night when Australia crushed India in the ODI World Cup final at the same venue. The gesture was, perhaps, an acceptance of finality.Kohli was in remarkable form in that World Cup, compiling 765 runs, the most in the competition. He even picked up a rare wicket.On Wednesday too, the Orange Cap sat well on Kohli's head. The 35-year-old amassed a staggering 741 runs in 15 IPL matches this season, the best by a distance. Yet his individual brilliance could not take his team over the line.The agonizing wait for a maiden IPL trophy has now stretched to 17 years. His peers, MS Dhoni and Rohit Sharma , in contrast, have lifted the cup five times each.For a decade now, Kohli has toiled for the IPL title, conjuring stirring fightbacks, leading from the front and silencing critics with his form rather than words. Yet, season after season, the dream has crumbled. As the brightest spark in RCB 's campaign this season, Kohli was uncharacteristically sedate at the beginning - which reflected in the side's poor start.Dinesh Karthik , at the back end of the batting lineup, stole the limelight. But Kohli's class and his proven ability to stay focused amid the pandemonium came through. There was serenity as he went about rediscovering his mojo.His hunger for runs mirrored an astonishing average of 61.75 at a strike rate of 154.69. His milestones included a century and five half-centuries. He also showcased another characteristic, that of a fielder par excellence.Kohli 2.0 has come across as a rare breed, a cricketer who oozes talent, class and unabashed aggression. He continues to wear his heart on his sleeve and leave people awestruck with his ability to accelerate the scoring at the optimum opportunity. He makes the 8000-plus IPL runs he has scored, since joining RCB as a rookie in the inaugural year in 2008, seem incidental.It's hard not to think of Kohli as a square peg in the wrong team, but it wasn't all gloom. He still looked at the positives. ""We began expressing ourselves, started to play for our self-respect, and then the confidence came back. The way we turned things around and qualified was truly special, something that I will always, always cherish and remember because it took a lot of character from each member of this team. It's something we can be proud of,"" he said.RCB head coach, former skipper of Zimbabwe, Andy flower was all praise for Kohli. ""The way he thinks about the game - he backs that up with an amazing level of skill, aggression and hunger - I look forward to watching him in the World Cup. I think it's amazing that he is still evolving his game,"" he said.Kohli showed there still is plenty of ammunition left in his armoury. It augurs well for India with the T20 World Cup around the corner.It is proof enough that Kohli has plenty more to give, regardless of the chatter that he is heading towards the sunset.","Virat Kohli's Royal Challengers Bengaluru were beaten by Rajasthan Royals in the IPL Eliminator on Wednesday night.

CHENNAI: A week before the start of the IPL , Ravichandran Ashwin had an evening to cherish at his very own Chepauk. A felicitation was organized by the Tamil Nadu Cricket Association for the master offie for crossing 500 Test wickets and completing 100 Tests. Ashwin got a little emotional as he spoke about what the venue has meant to him over the years.Ashwin has achieved everything as a cricketer at the Chepauk. He even bowled a match-winning spell of 3-16 against RCB in the 2011 IPL final for CSK , when he removed Chris Gayle with one that came in with the arm. But if there's one feather that he can still add to his already-decorated cap, it is an IPL title for an 'away' side at his home ground.On Friday, the 37-year-old will find out if he will get to play another final against Kolkata Knight Riders, and standing in his way is the mighty batting line-up of Sunrisers Hyderabad, led by Travis Head, Abhishek Sharma and Heinrich Klaasen. The Chepauk pitch will have something in it for the spinners and the fact that Ashwin played a game here a couple of weeks ago should give him a fair idea of how to go about it.""In that game, we got only 145 and that was a bit of a shock,"" Ashwin said on Tuesday after his match-winning spell of 2-19 against Royal Challengers Bangalore in Ahmedabad.Ashwin had an indifferent start to the IPL, but he has slowly come into his own at the back-end of the tournament. In 14 games, he has taken 9 wickets at an economy rate of 8.31, which is probably not his best. By his own admission, the off-spinner was playing with an abdomen injury, which was stopping him from giving his best in the first few games.""It has basically been a tale of two IPLs for me. In the first half of the tournament, my body couldn't move and I had an abdomen injury. I wanted to put my body on the line but wasn't always able to do it,"" Ashwin said.But as the IPL progressed, the injury healed and the pitches, too, started to get a little tired. It meant that the spinners got just a little more purchase out of the tracks, and who better than Ashwin to make the most of it.On Wednesday, against a top class RCB batting lineup high on confidence, he brought all his variations - the slower off-break, the faster off-break and the drifter - into play to stifle Virat Kohli & Co. at a crucial juncture.""When you are coming from Test matches, your body needs to get used to T20 cricket. I bowled a lot off-game also because I needed bowling time under my belt,"" Ashwin explained about his resurgence.He has also Yuzvendra Chahal, India's No. 1 T20 leggie with him, and with the Chepauk pitch affording a bit of turn, the Chennai boy may just give the home fans something to cheer about after CSK's departure from the IPL.",Ravichandran Ashwin will play in the final of the IPL on Friday.

In a thrilling contest in Texas on Thursday, Ali Khan emerged as the hero for the USA, clinching a pivotal victory in the second match of the three-game series by six runs, thereby securing the series with a 2-0 lead. Khan’s crucial three-wicket haul in the latter stages of the game was instrumental in stalling Bangladesh 's chase of 145 runs. Saurabh Netravalkar also contributed significantly, taking a vital wicket in the 19th over.The initial victory on Tuesday marked a significant milestone for the USA, being their first against a top-ten T20I team. This win not only boosted their confidence but also highlighted their readiness for the upcoming World Cup.For Bangladesh, the series has been nothing short of a debacle. Their chase faltered early, with two wickets falling in the powerplay. Despite a brief recovery through a 48-run partnership between Captain Najmul Hossain Shanto and Towhid Hridoy, the innings crumbled. Veteran Shakib Al Hasan 's efforts were in vain as Ali Khan dismissed him in the crucial 18th over, swinging the momentum back to the USA.Bangladesh's bowling was led by Rishad Hossain, who delivered his most economical T20I spell, taking two wickets for 21 runs. Mustafizur Rahman and Shoriful Islam also bagged two wickets each. For the USA, Monank Patel led the scoring with 42 runs, while Aaron Jones supported well with 35 runs, though their efforts could not capitalize on a solid start in the powerplay.The chase saw the USA's bowlers make early inroads. Netravalkar's early dismissal of Soumya Sarkar set the tone. Tanzid Hasan started promisingly but soon lost his wicket, adding pressure on the middle order. The Bangladeshis faced a mix-up leading to Shanto's run-out, followed by quick dismissals of Hridoy and Mahmudullah.Ali Khan's late resurgence in the game was pivotal. After narrowly surviving a run-out, Shakib managed two boundaries but eventually succumbed to Khan, triggering a collapse. Khan's consistent bowling in the final overs ensured no comeback from the Bangladesh tailenders, sealing a historic win for the USA.The match also highlighted strong performances during the first half, with USA's openers, Taylor and Monank, building a solid foundation. Despite losing wickets immediately after the powerplay, USA managed a competitive score, thanks in part to a resilient partnership between Monank and Jones.Major League Cricket (MLC) in the USA is an ambitious endeavor to popularize the sport in a region where it has traditionally been overshadowed by more dominant sports like basketball, baseball, and football. Established with the vision of tapping into the large and growing cricket-loving expatriate community and introducing Americans to the sport, MLC has fostered a robust cricketing ecosystem.MLC has invested in world-class facilities and engaged with global cricketing talents to promote cricket in America.The initiative reflects a broader ambition to not only enhance the level of competitive cricket in the USA but also to make it a key player on the international stage, as evidenced by the country co-hosting the T20 World Cup.Minor League Cricket (MiLC) in America plays a critical role in promoting the sport across the country. Launched as a developmental cricket league, MiLC serves as a feeder system to Major League Cricket, nurturing local talent and providing a structured pathway for emerging players to progress to higher levels of competition. By focusing on local engagement and talent development, MiLC ensures a sustainable growth model for cricket in the U.S.The league operates by harnessing the enthusiasm of local communities, often involving a significant number of expatriates from cricket-loving nations.

How RR deal with Travi-Shek

Yuzi-Ashwin factor

SRH's fifth-bowler issue

CHENNAI: It's the point of no return now. After the roller-coaster of the last two months, Rajasthan Royals and Sunrisers Hyderabad will fight it out at the MA Chidambaram Stadium on Friday night for a place in the IPL final against Kolkata Knight Riders With CSK exiting in the league stage, the madness and the clamour for tickets that's normally attached to an IPL game in the city isn't there, but that doesn't mean the fans won't turn up. While SRH have a following in the city due to the obvious southern India connect, Chennai boy Ravichandran Ashwin's presence in the Rajasthan Royals team will surely make many root for the 2008 champions.It can be noted that probably the best match of this IPL was played between the two sides on May 2, when SRH won by one run and started a three-week winless streak for RR. That streak was finally snapped in Ahmedabad on Wednesday with a morale-boosting win against Royal Challengers Bengaluru.It's to be seen if Sanju Samson 's side can build on that momentum as SRH try to regroup themselves after the loss to KKR at the Narendra Modi Stadium a day before. TOI takes a look at what could be the deciding factors in this battle of equals...The Travis Head-Abhishek Sharma duo has taken this IPL by storm. The duo's no fear approach has often taken games away from opposition in the powerplay itself. But in the last two games, Head was dismissed for 0, left-arm swing bowlers Arshdeep Singh and Mitchell Starc dismissing him with balls swinging in.RR also have Kiwi left-armer Trent Boult in their lineup and Samson would surely unleash him to get the destructive Head out of the way early. If Royals win this match-up, they will definitely have the upper-hand and then they will bank on the experience of their spinners-R Ashwin and Yuzvendra Chahal-to deal with the Abhishek threat on a pitch which should have something for the spinners.There's absolutely no denying that this is the best spin attack of this IPL. While leggie Chahal is an absolute master of T20 cricket and has made the Indian team for the T20 World Cup on the basis of performances in this IPL, Ashwin is a modern-day great.While Ashwin's ability to take the ball away from the left-handers with his beautiful drift could be crucial in powerplay, Yuzi has to come into his own against the likes of Heinrich Klaasen. The South African is a feared hitter of spin in the middle-overs and the Yuzi-Klaasen duel has to be one of the highlights of this clash.Sunrisers, in their last couple of games, have gone in with four specialist bowlers with spin and medium-pace allrounders Shahbaz Ahmed and Nitish Reddy sharing the fifth bowler's slot. It is diametrically opposite to the RR formula, which is to bank on five top-quality bowlers to do the job.It will be interesting to see if SRH stick to the approach in this age of 'Impact Sub' in a game as crucial as this. If they do, one can be rest assured RR batters will wait for these four overs to try and take the game away from Pat Cummins ' boys.","Rajasthan Royals and Sunrisers Hyderabad will fight it out at the MA Chidambaram Stadium on Friday night for a place in the IPL final. The best match of this IPL was played on May 2, when SRH won by one run and started a three-week winless streak for RR.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110378697,imgsize-44432,width-400,resizemode-4/110378697.jpg"

You need to have that fear because unless, if I don't have fear, I can never be brave. I can never be courageous, you know. So I always felt that fear is important, that the pressure is important because that helps me take the right decision, keeping everything in mind. If I have fear, you know, a lot of people talk about I'm fearless.""If you are fearless, then you will be reckless. Because if I don't have fear, I won't respect the normal thing. If I don't have fear of height let's say nothing. So, it hardly matters when I am walking on the road, when I am walking on the rope, you know. So I felt all these things are important for the development of an individual,"" Dhoni said.Dhoni, who led CSK to a record five Indian Premier League titles, stepped down as the skipper before the start of the ongoing season, handing the responsibilities toRuturaj Gaikwad , who led the team to a fifth place finish.Speculations have been rife that this could be Dhoni's final season in the tournament but CSK CEO Kasi Viswanathan said that it was completely up to the former India captain to take a final call on his future. Viswanathan also said he is 'very, very hopeful' of Dhoni featuring in IPL 2025 as a player.""I do not know. It is a question which only MS can answer. The question for us, we have always respected the decisions taken by MS. We have left it to him,"" he said to a question on CSK's YouTube channel.""As all of you know, he has always taken his decisions and announced them at the appropriate time. We do expect that we will get a decision as and when he decides.""But we are very, very hopeful that he will be available for CSK the next year. That is the view and expectations of the fans and mine.""Dhoni, who underwent surgery to treat a knee injury issue last year, scored 161 runs in 73 balls at a strike rate of 220.55 this season. He was also good behind the stumps.A mega IPL auction has been scheduled later in the year and if Dhoni continues, CSK will undoubtedly be retaining him.However, the number of players allowed to be retained still needs clarity.Viswanathan said that discussions are yet to take place on the same with the BCCI.""It is too early because we have still not heard from BCCI on the kind of retentions which are going to be part of the next cycle of auction.""So we are expecting that the BCCI would discuss with all franchise owners before they take a decision on retention.""","MS Dhoni says fear and pressure are important for development of an individual.

However, the US batsmen capitalized on the opportunities to set a target of 144/6. Monank Patel led from the front with 42 runs off 38 balls, including four fours and one six. Aaron Jones contributed 35 runs from 34 balls, and Steven Taylor added 31 runs from 28 balls.

Three would have been enough. I do not think we will ever play four spinners in a game. Ravindra Jadeja will play. Maybe Kuldeep Yadav and Yuzvendra Chahal will play with him.

There is a reason for four spinners which I am not going to say now but I wanted four spinners for sure and three seamers and Hardik being fourth,"" Rohit said in a press conference earlier this month.Notably, despite having four spinners in the squad, India still doesn't possess an off-spinner in their talented pool of players.Washington Sundar and Ravichandran Ashwin were the two available options to pick from the off-spin department. But India decided to go against the option due to both players lacking game time.The Men in Blue will begin their T20 World Cup campaign against Ireland on June 5, at the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium, New York, followed by the marquee clash against Pakistan on June 09 at the same venue.

NEW DELHI: Royal Challengers Bengaluru 's loss in the Eliminator clash on Wednesday against Rajasthan Royals ended their dream second half run as they crashed out of IPL 2024 .Unable to defend a par 172, the defeat in the knock-out game halted RCB 's six-match winning streak.Although RCB did claw back in game for a brief period when scratchy Royals lost quick wickets mid-way in chase but a composed Riyan Parag and later Rovman Powell ensured that their side crossed the finish line with an over to spare.And with the game slipping away from RCB's grasp towards the end, team's star Virat Kohli was visibly angry as he was seen mumbling and smashing bottle while fielding at the fence.In a viral video, Kohli's frustrated avatar came to the fore when Yash Dayal was hit for consecutive boundaries in the 17th over of Royals' chase. In the video, Kohli can be seen complaining to fellow RCB player and support staff as Dayal leaked boundaries.Royals ended RCB's roller coaster run with a scrappy four-wicket win in the Eliminator.After their bowlers had done their part well to keep RCB to 172 for 8, RR batters stuttered in the middle overs to allow RCB back into the contest which remained hung in balance for the majority of the second half, but the 2008 winners eventually got home with an over to spare.Chasing 173, Rajasthan ended with 174 for 6 as Powell (16 not out) provided the finishing touches in a tense finish.",Royal Challengers Bengaluru crashed out of IPL 2024.

With West Indies co-hosting the tournament Parthiv thought that India should field Kuldeep, Jade and Chahal in the playing XI.""The conditions are favourable for the spinners, especially the West Indies one and the installed pitch at the USA will support spinners when the ball gets 4 to 5 over old. So, I think going with four spin options is a very good decision until and unless it backfires. I am really confident of Chahal’s comeback with the way he has bowled and Kuldeep has always been magnificent,"" he added.When asked whom he wants to see in the wicket-keeper option Parthiv with no doubt said, ""Sanju Samson should be the first choice wicketkeeper for India.

NEW DELHI: After recovering from an unusual injury this month, world number one Novak Djokovic is looking to gain some experience before defending his championship at Roland Garros this week at the Geneva Open.Djokovic hasn't won a title in 2024 and has had a difficult season.The 24-time Grand Slam champion lost to Casper Ruud in the Monte Carlo semifinals, which started a less than ideal preparation for the French Open .Two days after being struck in the head by a fan's water bottle while signing autographs, he decided not to play in the Madrid Open and instead lost in the Italian Open's third round.The Serbian told reporters on Tuesday that ""the head is good,"" despite saying he felt off after his 6-2 6-3 loss to Alejandro Tabilo . Everything is good. After more than a week of training, I feel great.""I've dedicated quite a bit of time with my new fitness coach to build the endurance, to build physical strength and capabilities that I need in order to play a best-of-five Grand Slam on the physically most demanding surface, which is clay.""So, hopefully, I'm going to get more than one match here in Geneva, that's the goal and then let's see what happens in Paris.""On Wednesday, Djokovic will play his opening match in Geneva against Yannick Hanfmann of Germany, who earlier in the event defeated three-time Grand Slam champion Andy Murray .""The reason why I chose to come and play is because I feel like, at this moment, there is no better practice for me than match play,"" Djokovic said.""I feel like I need more matches, even if it's one match, two matches, three, four hopefully. It's good for me, because that's the way for me to try to find that kind of form that I need for Roland Garros.""",World number one Novak Djokovic is looking to gain some experience before defending his championship at Roland Garros this week.

NEW DELHI: Rafael Nadal , the 14-time French Open champion, has been struggling with fitness issues as he approaches the end of his illustrious career. However, Novak Djokovic , the world number one, believes that Nadal remains the favorite to win the upcoming French Open.Djokovic, who is currently preparing for the tournament at the Geneva Open , acknowledged that Nadal faces increasing competition from younger players.Nevertheless, he emphasized that as long as the Spaniard is in the draw, he cannot be discounted.The Serbian star's comments highlight the immense respect and admiration he has for Nadal's achievements and abilities on the clay courts of Roland Garros .""This year is more open,"" French Open defending champion Djokovic told reporters at the Parc des Eaux-Vives grounds in Geneva.""Casper Ruud is surely one of the five players who are candidates to win. You have Alexander Zverev, Andrey Rublev, Stefanos Tsitsipas -- all the players who won a major tournament on this surface this year.""But when you talk about Roland-Garros and Nadal is there, he is always the biggest favourite for me.""After everything he has done on the courts at Roland-Garros, it's normal, respectfully, to put him as the biggest favourite.""Obviously it's a little different with his level of play. But it's Roland-Garros, and it's Nadal.""After that, maybe me, if I feel good, if I play well. At Roland-Garros, and all the Grand Slams, I am a bit of a different player.""Djokovic, on the cusp of his 37th birthday on Wednesday, made a last-minute decision to participate in the Geneva tournament by accepting a wild card entry.His aim is to reverse a concerning decline in his performance as he prepares to defend his title at the French Open, which commences next week.The Swiss clay court event, featuring a compact draw of 28 players, acts as the ultimate preparation for the prestigious Grand Slam tournament.Djokovic, who holds an impressive record of 24 Grand Slam titles, is facing an unusual situation this year. He will enter the French Open without having secured a single title in the season, a first since 2018. However, a victory in Geneva could change that narrative.While time has caught up with 37-year-old Nadal, Djokovic said he was hungry to keep playing at the top.""I'm searching for my highest possible level,"" he said.""It's not an obligation. It's truly my desire, my feeling, my passion, my love for tennis. That's the most important. I'm seeking to stay connected with that feeling.""Djokovic said he knew Geneva well as he has cousins in the Swiss city, though he has never played at the Geneva Tennis Club before.""At this moment, there is no better practice for me than match play. So I feel like I need more matches,"" he said.""That's the way for me to try to find the kind of form that I need for Roland-Garros.""Djokovic was at the Stade de Geneve on Monday to witness Young Boys winning a 17th Swiss football championship with a 1-0 victory over hosts Servette -- a team the Serb has a long-standing fondness for.Djokovic said one of his cousins was set to marry a Servette player -- French midfielder Timothe Cognat, according to Swiss media.Djokovic's best friend, and best man at his wedding, was defender Neven Markovic, who played for Servette from 2013 to 2015.""That's why I'm supporting the club,"" Djokovic said, jovially adding that Markovic could perhaps best be categorised as a ""very physical player"".""I'm not a football expert -- but he's a crazy guy,"" he said.",Novak Djokovic believes Rafael Nadal is the favorite to win the French Open.

NEW DELHI: The highly anticipated possibility of another match between Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic vanished on Tuesday as Murray exited the Geneva Open , marking his comeback from an ankle injury.Murray, playing on a wild card, was trailing 7-5, 4-1 against Yannick Hanfmann when a thunderstorm interrupted play at Parc des Eaux-Vives on Monday. Resuming on Tuesday, the German world number 85 swiftly concluded the match, taking the second set 6-2 in just over 10 minutes.Since Friday's draw, tennis enthusiasts had hoped for what could have been the final encounter between two members of the legendary Big Four—Djokovic, Murray, Rafael Nadal, and the retired Roger Federer—who have dominated men’s tennis for the past two decades.Instead, Hanfmann will face world number one Djokovic in the second round on Wednesday.Currently ranked 75th, the 37-year-old Murray, who plays with a metal hip, has indicated he may retire from competitive tennis within a few months. Nadal, similarly beset by injuries, is also nearing the end of his career and is uncertain about participating in the upcoming French Open .The Geneva match marked Murray’s first tour-level appearance since he injured tendons in his left ankle in Miami in March. The 28-man Swiss clay court tournament is a crucial preparation event for the French Open, the year’s second Grand Slam.Djokovic, who turns 37 on Wednesday, entered Geneva with a wild card to address a concerning slump in form ahead of defending his French Open title next week. The 24-time Grand Slam champion risks arriving in Paris without a title this season for the first time since 2018 unless he wins in Geneva.The Geneva draw also features Casper Ruud, the Norwegian world number seven, and other top 20 players such as Taylor Fritz , Ben Shelton, and Sebastian Baez .Murray and Djokovic last faced each other in the 2017 Doha final, where the Serbian emerged victorious.Murray, a former world number one and three-time Grand Slam champion, won the US Open in 2012 and Wimbledon in 2013 and 2016, with 11 Grand Slam final appearances. He also secured Olympic singles titles in 2012 and 2016.","Novak Djokovic will face Yannick Hanfmann in the second round of Geneva Open.

NEW DELHI: Rafael Nadal , the 14-time French Open champion, returned to Roland Garros to practice and assess his readiness for the upcoming tournament.The 37-year-old Spaniard arrived in the late afternoon with his coach, Carlos Moya, and a few sparring partners at the main stadium, Court Philippe Chatrier, which was open to the public.Approximately 6,000 fans were present at the stadium, enthusiastically cheering as Nadal stepped onto the court.The practice session lasted around an hour and a half, after which Nadal signed several autographs before exiting through a doorway leading to the locker rooms.The training session allowed Nadal to familiarize himself with the red clay at Roland Garros, as he hasn't played a match there in two years, and to evaluate his physical condition. Nadal has been recovering from a hip injury that required surgery and has caused him to miss most of the 2023 season, as well as dealing with issues related to a hip muscle and an abdominal muscle.Nadal's recent loss to Hubert Hurkacz at the Italian Open, with a score of 6-1, 6-3, left him uncertain about his readiness for the French Open. ""Let's see what's going on, how I feel myself mentally tomorrow, after tomorrow, and in one week,"" Nadal said in Rome. ""If I feel ready, I (am) going to try to be there and fight for the things that I have been fighting (for) the last 15 years, (even) if now (that) seems impossible.""As of Monday, Nadal had not yet announced his decision regarding his participation in the French Open. This is expected to be his final season on tour, making this potentially his last appearance at a tournament he has won more times than any other tennis player has won any Grand Slam title. Nadal won the French Open in 2022, securing his 22nd major championship overall, which is second only to Novak Djokovic 's 24. He missed the French Open last year due to his hip injury.","Rafael Nadal returns to Roland Garros to practice and assess his readiness for the French Open.
