‘All we want is a peaceful settlement’

‘

Politics is not permanent

’

NEW DELHI: Siddaramaiah and his deputy DK Shivakumar had two breakfasts together within a week, but the deadlock over the Karnataka chief ministerial post does not seem likely to end soon.The second round of the ""breakfast diplomacy"" at the deputy chief minister's residence drew a blank yet again, after both Siddaramaiah and DKS left the decision to the party high command.""When the high command says,"" Siddaramaiah responded when asked when Shivakumar would become the chief minister.""So far, there is no communication from the high command on the timeline for any decision on the matter. If they (high command) call us, we will definitely go and meet them. Tomorrow, I will be meeting AICC General Secretary K C Venugopal at a function where both of us are invited,"" he added.Both Congress leaders also put up a united front. The chief minister asserted that there are no differences between him and his deputy, adding that they are running the government like “brothers” and will continue to do so in the future as well.Meanwhile, home minister G Parameshwar, another name in the fray for the CM post, acknowledged the stir and called for a “peaceful settlement.”""It's a good thing that our leaders are getting together again for breakfast. All we want is a peaceful settlement of whatever has happened over the month or so. As suggested by the high command, they are meeting for the second time. All the issues are settled. It is just reciprocal, nothing else,"" Parameshwar said.Additionally, hours after meeting DKS, Siddaramaiah added to the speculation as he was heard saying “politics is not permanent” during an informal conversation with Congress MLA Belur Gopal.Though the context of the conversation — the video of which has gone viral — is unclear, it is being linked to CM change talks in the state.""Whatever has to happen, let it happen. Is politics my father's property? Politics is not permanent,"" Siddaramaiah can be heard telling Gopal Krishna, MLA from Sagara, as they emerged from inside Vidhana Soudha.This comes after the first breakfast between Siddaramaiah and DKS. The outreach comes after the Congress high command nudged both leaders to present a united front ahead of the Belagavi legislature session starting December 8.Earlier, as soon as the Congress government in Karnataka completed its halfway mark on November 20, reports quoting Congress sources suggested that MLAs and MLCs from Shivakumar’s faction had camped in Delhi to push the party high command to make him the next chief minister.DK Shivakumar added to the speculation after he claimed there had indeed been “a confidential understanding on leadership transition among five-six leaders” soon after Congress won a landslide in the 2023 elections.The deputy chief minister made the first reference to the power pact but stopped short of divulging more details. “This is confidential. I don’t want to speak publicly on this,” he said.",Both Siddaramaiah and DKS left the decision to the party high command.

"Parry wanted to quit crime, so Lawrence had him killed: Kin",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/parry-wanted-to-quit-crime-so-lawrence-had-him-killed-kin/articleshow/125727464.cms,"ANI photo

CHANDIGARH: A day after Inderpreet Singh, alias Parry, a one-time trusted aide of gangster Lawrence Bishnoi, was gunned down on a Chandigarh street, two audio clips, purportedly of Goldy Brar, Lawrence’s rival, were released Tuesday containing a threat to kill Lawrence to avenge the murder, intensifying fears of a gang war.While police are verifying the authenticity of the audios, Parry’s family says he was murdered because he wanted to quit crime. “He was acquitted in eight of the 12 cases against him. He got married on Nov 13 and wanted to start life afresh, leaving the life of crime behind. But the Lawrence gang was not happy with his decision. Parry’s unwillingness to be associated with Lawrence or any other gangster was the main reason behind his murder,” said a relative.“We are affluent. We don’t need his crime money,” added another relative.“Losing her newly-married son has sent Parry’s mother into a state of shock,” said Harneet Singh, Parry’s brother, an ASI with Punjab police. Parry’s father retired as a Punjab police inspector.Talking to TOI over the phone, Parry’s brother said Lawrence was a frequent visitor to their house, and would often stay overnight. Mourning his brother, he said, “My mother would feed Lawrence like a son and he repaid her love by killing Parry.”Recounting his last few hours, Parry’s kin said that on the day of the murder, he left to drop his bride somewhere around 4pm. When he returned, he received a call from one of his friends and left home again. He met some friends at a club in Sector 26 and that is when he received a call from Lawrence, who called him to the nearby timber market to discuss a “personal issue” and said his associates will accompany him, said his family. When he reached the designated spot, he was shot dead, they said.It tallies with what the audio clips say. A voice purportedly of Goldy claims Lawrence called Parry on the phone on Monday, congratulated him on his wedding and said he needed to discuss a personal matter. “He asked Parry to come to a place in Sector 26, saying some of his gang members would meet him there and it would be safe to talk on the phone. When Parry arrived to talk, he was murdered,” he says.The voice on the ‘Goldy’ audio clip then threatens Lawrence, saying, “No one in the world can save you now.”","Inderpreet Singh, alias Parry, a one-time trusted aide of gangster Lawrence Bishnoi, was gunned down on a Chandigarh street.

The Downsides and Risks

For the Golden State Warriors

For the Dallas Mavericks

My Final Thoughts: A Trade That Makes Sense for Both

Theand Dallas Mavericks are circling what might be one of the cleaner, more logical trade ideas of the early season: a near-salary-match swap of Buddy Hield for Naji Marshall. With both teams wrestling with roster imbalances and apron complications, this framework has gained traction among analysts - and it may only take a light third-team assist to get across the finish line.This article breaks down why the move makes sense, how the trade fits financially, and what each side stands to gain.Golden State Warriors’ backcourt has become overcrowded. The offseason addition of Seth Curry, the upcoming return of De’Anthony Melton, and the emergence of younger rotation guards have pushed Buddy Hield into a diminished role. His shooting remains valuable, but his defensive liabilities and age (32) are out of sync with what Steve Kerr needs around Stephen Curry as he enters his age-37 season.The Warriors are hunting for wing depth, size, and defensive presence - something Naji Marshall brings immediately. Marshall, at 6’7”, plays with an edge that fits their small-ball identity. As Sporting News framed it, this is a chance to flip “regression for progression.”Dallas Mavericks have struggled early due to injuries and uneven spacing around Luka Dončić and Kyrie Irving. Adding Hield’s proven 40 percent career three-point shooting, currently at 35 percent, gives the Mavericks a plug-and-play floor-spacer who thrives off the ball.A reunion between Hield and Luka makes sense: catch-and-shoot gravity is the one thing that Dallas always seems to need more of. While Hield’s defense remains a concern, Dallas isn’t chasing him to guard wings, they want him to stretch the floor and revive an offense that has sputtered at times.The finances are straightforward, which is rare in today’s apron-heavy NBA. Both players make around $9 million, creating a clean match.The only obstacle is the apron. Both teams are close enough to the line that a harmless third-team salary dump could be required—but nothing involving picks or additional rotation players.This is why analysts consider the deal both realistic and low-friction.Early 2025-26 numbers paint a clear contrast between the two players’ current trajectories.• A 6’7” defensive-minded wing who fits switch-heavy schemes• Added toughness in a frontcourt that still relies heavily on Draymond Green• A more balanced roster without inflating payroll• Perimeter defense that helps mask aging legs in the core rotation• A player averaging 1.3 steals per game - something the Warriors badly need• A career 40 percent shooter who improves spacing instantly• A complementary weapon for Luka Dončić when defenses overload• A veteran scorer who can help stabilize inconsistent bench units• A temporary boost while waiting for injured wings to return• A no-risk flier on a player looking for a fresh startNo trade is perfect, and both franchises would accept certain risks.• Marshall’s 25.8 percent from deep is a real concern• Spacing around Curry and Klay Thompson could tighten• Marshall doesn’t solve their backup-center issues• Hield’s defense remains a glaring weakness• At 32, he offers less long-term upside• He could struggle to earn closing minutes in high-stakes gamesYet neither set of risks is deal-breaking - especially in December, when teams still have time to adjust.This rumored swap is not a blockbuster. It won’t dominate headlines like a superstar trade. But the best in-season moves are often the simplest, targeting needs instead of names.Also read: NBA trade rumors: Los Angeles Lakers predicted to chase $186 million Milwaukee Bucks star to form the league’s next superteam The Warriors would be trading fading shooting for live-wire defense. The Mavericks would be trading defensive grit for floor spacing. Both would be addressing immediate problems without sacrificing assets or flexibility. And in an NBA where margins matter, this is exactly the kind of understated deal that can quietly shift a season. If the teams can navigate the apron complications with a small third-team assist, this is a trade that checks every box.","Golden State Warriors’ backcourt has become overcrowded.

Justin Herbert’s gritty performance heightens momentum and fuels talk around his relationship with Madison Beer

Madison Beer brought more than star power to Sunday’s Chargers–Raiders matchup; she also got a full family celebration. While Los Angeles cruised to a 31–14 win, Beer transformed one of SoFi Stadium’s suites into an intimate birthday event for her mother, Tracie Beer. The game itself delivered plenty of excitement, but the off-field moment stole hearts online.Fans watched Madison lead a surprise complete with cupcakes, candles, and a warm sing-along of ‘Happy Birthday.’ Tracie later shared the clips on Instagram, including the touching moment Madison wrapped her mom in a tight hug. The family presence added new buzz around Beer’s growing connection with Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert Even as the suite celebrations unfolded, Justin Herbert was commanding attention with a performance defined by both efficiency and grit. The star quarterback suffered a broken left hand early in the game, fortunately, his non-throwing hand, and yet he remained on the field, completing 15 of 20 passes for 151 yards and two touchdowns.His perseverance pushed the Chargers to their eighth win, keeping them firmly in the AFC playoff race at 8–4.On Monday, Herbert underwent surgery, but both he and the team sounded confident about his availability moving forward. Offering a promising update, Herbert told reporters, ""I think they are pretty hopeful actually… It's one of those things where you stabilize it.They are hopeful, so that's a good thing."" With a primetime matchup against the Eagles on December 8 approaching, his potential return continues to be a major storyline. Off the field, Herbert’s bond with Madison Beer again became a focal point for fans. With Madison’s mother now attending games, many see it as a sign that the relationship is strengthening.The timing couldn’t be more compelling as the Chargers chase a postseason berth and prepare for a potentially decisive Week 18 showdown with the Broncos, a game that may carry major playoff weight. And if Beer is in the building again, Herbert will certainly hope the good luck continues, minus the injuries.Also read: “End of an old chapter”: Justin Herbert’s beau Madison Beer gets emotional unveiling her new era with her new album ‘Locket’","Madison Beer celebrated her mother's birthday in a suite during Sunday's Chargers-Raiders game.

Auston Matthews’ captaincy questioned as former Leafs GM hints the team elevated the wrong figure,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/auston-matthews-captaincy-questioned-as-former-leafs-gm-hints-the-team-elevated-the-wrong-figure/articleshow/125697194.cms,"Former Leafs GM slams current leadership and claims Auston Matthews was the wrong choice for captain (Getty Images)

Former Leafs boss criticizes leadership group and suggests Matthews isn’t the captain Toronto desperately needs





The Toronto Maple Leafs find themselves in a moment of uncomfortable reflection. What began as a bold shift in leadership by handing Auston Matthews the captaincy has now become a topic of pointed criticism, sparked by a former executive who feels the team lost its compass. The question drawing attention across the hockey world is simple. Did the Leafs pick the wrong captain, and are they now paying the price through uninspired play and fragile identity?Former Leafs GM Gord Stellick spoke plainly about the heart of the issue. He believes leadership and talent are not synonymous. He said, ""There's nothing wrong if your best player isn't a leader. All I can say is last year, you couldn't be more of a team guy, a classy guy, the way he (John Tavares) handled the transition, and then the leadership meant nothing, it's not even a visible thing. It's almost like an award to wear the C. "" His words echo the sentiment of many frustrated fans who now look back at that decision with uneasy hindsight.Stellick did not stop at questioning Auston Matthews as captain. He revealed who he would have chosen. ""If you would have asked me a few years ago, I would've picked Morgan Rielly. He kind of strikes me as a captain, but its an important thing being the captain, and the leadership group is important.""Rielly has longevity and presence, but like Matthews, has never quite taken command of the locker room in that commanding way a captain must.Tavares remains the quiet constant. A professional who knows when to speak, when to deliver and when to let his play do the talking. Yet the captaincy shift forced him to take a step back in title, even if not in spirit. Stellick suggested the leadership change carried symbolism more than substance, raising the concern that the Leafs valued optics over intrinsic leadership dynamics.Still, accountability now rests on the current leaders. As Stellick put it, ""At some point you got to evolve to be the real leaders, and that's where we're going to find out now, a litmus test, about a team that has no business [being] where they are right now, and can this leadership group lead them?"" That test is already underway.If Matthews and his leadership group cannot steer this franchise back to identity and resilience, then the Maple Leafs may soon find John Tavares acting as the quiet stabilizing force once more. Captain or not, his presence still commands respect, even without the C sewn onto his jersey.Also Read: Connor Bedard’s fearless statement after Ducks game shows he’s ready to change the NHL narrative","Former Leafs GM Gord Stellick says Auston Matthews is not the captain Toronto desperately needs.

Toropchenko and Snuggerud's injury impact on St. Louis Blues



The St. Louis Blues released concerning NHL injury updates on Monday, confirming that two regular forwards will be unavailable for an extended period. The timing could not be worse, with the team trying to stabilize its lineup amid mixed NHL match results over recent weeks.Injuries are part of the league’s reality, but losing two players under very different circumstances has amplified concern. One setback came during regular-season play, while the other happened entirely away from the ice, underscoring how unpredictable roster challenges can be in the NHL.Forward Alexey Toropchenko is expected to miss multiple weeks after suffering scalding burns to his legs in a home accident. The incident was confirmed as non-hockey related, and the team has provided limited details, listing him as week-to-week. Toropchenko’s physical presence and defensive responsibility had made him a reliable bottom-six option, and his absence thins the Blues’ forward depth during upcoming NHL match previews.Before the injury, Toropchenko had been regularly involved in tough minutes, including penalty-kill situations and matchups against opposing checking lines.At the same time, rookie forward Jimmy Snuggerud will be sidelined for at least six weeks after undergoing surgery on his left wrist. The young forward had reportedly been playing through discomfort before medical staff determined surgery was necessary.Snuggerud’s injury is a blow to the offensive side of the lineup. The rookie had shown steady development and contributed timely scoring. Thus, making his absence noticeable in the top-nine rotation. Losing both a developing scorer and a physical depth forward. That too, simultaneously complicates lineup balance.For now, the focus remains on recovery. If Toropchenko and Snuggerud return as expected later in the season, they could provide a timely boost. Until then, the Blues must navigate a demanding schedule. That too, without two key pieces of their forward group.Also Read: NHL Update: Brad Marchand and his family hosts Thanksgiving to comfort teammates missing home","Alexey Toropchenko suffered scalding burns to his legs in a home accident.

Why Cincinnati Makes Sense for Buxton

Astros’ Motive: Rotation Stability

Twins’ Return: Prospects to Support a Transition

Why the Deal Still Feels Unlikely

The Cincinnati Reds may be approaching the offseason with several areas to evaluate, but one need sits clearly above the rest: adding more power to a lineup that struggled to produce consistent thump. A new trade concept from MLB.com’s Anthony Castrovince puts forward a dramatic solution - one that involves making a push for Minnesota Twins star Byron Buxton through a multi-team blockbuster. It’s an idea built around the Reds’ pitching depth and the possibility of acquiring a dynamic, game-changing outfielder without diving into the expensive end of free agency.But the proposal isn’t limited to a simple two-team exchange. Castrovince outlines a three-team structure involving the Reds, Twins, and Houston Astros, each addressing a different roster priority. For Cincinnati, it’s about landing a high-impact bat. For Houston, it’s securing a mid-rotation arm. And for Minnesota, it’s about collecting a group of prospects to support their transition. The concept may be unlikely to materialize, yet it brings together several logical elements that make it worth exploring.Castrovince’s concept revolves around the Reds leveraging their pitching depth, the Astros reinforcing their rotation, and the Twins securing a wave of prospects.Here is how the deal would look based on the proposal:Buxton, who has spent his entire career with Minnesota, is seen as an ideal fit for a Reds club that has been searching for a dynamic bat. As Castrovince wrote, “Buxton would be perfect for a Reds team that could use its pitching depth to address a lineup in need.”One of the major selling points is Buxton’s contract. He is owed roughly $15 million annually for the next three seasons, a number that sits well below what top free-agent hitters will command on the open market. That affordability naturally increases his appeal across the league, though Buxton previously declared himself “a Minnesota Twin for life,” a statement that could complicate any trade discussions.Houston’s inclusion centers on adding right-hander Brady Singer, who is entering his final year of arbitration. The Astros are facing the likely departure of Framber Valdez in free agency, leaving a gap in the middle of their rotation. Singer fits both their competitive timeline and their payroll.Castrovince noted, “Singer, who is entering his final year of arbitration, does not fit a Twins team in transition but does fit an Astros team that needs an affordable mid-rotation arm.” (H/t: Sporting News)Minnesota’s role in the deal is centered on long-term roster building. The Twins would receive four prospects, two from Cincinnati and two from Houston: Tyson Lewis, Mason Neville, Walker Janek, and Cole Hrtzler. The organization is navigating a transitional phase, and a multi-prospect return aligns with their broader strategy.Even with the pieces seemingly aligned, the proposal faces a major hurdle - Buxton’s ability to veto a trade. His long-standing connection to the Twins organization and his recent comments make any potential move difficult to finalize.Also read: MLB trade rumors: New York Yankees could bag $30 million Milwaukee Brewers 2x All-Star to improve title odds ahead of deadline Castrovince admitted that this is likely a trade that never happens, though he added that the framework hits several logical points for all involved clubs.

Shedeur Sanders’ performance and mom Pilar’s unwavering support





Shedeur Sanders stepped onto the field for his first professional home start with the Cleveland Browns on Sunday against the San Francisco 49ers, and all eyes were on both him and his supportive mom, Pilar Sanders. The rookie quarterback, drafted in the fifth round despite high expectations, has already started making waves after a victory over the Las Vegas Raiders last week. Throwing for 209 yards, a touchdown, and one interception, Shedeur proved that he could rise to the occasion when given the opportunity.This week, after being named QB1 over Dillon Gabriel, Sanders balanced preparation with family support. He spent time at his mother’s home with brother Shilo, enjoying home-cooked meals and studying film before the big game. But pregame attention wasn’t reserved for his on-field performance alone. Shedeur made headlines with a self-promoting outfit from his Legendary brand, and Pilar followed suit with a bold statement fit of her own. Browns fans and media couldn’t help but notice, as she continues to turn heads with her stylish game-day ensembles.Despite the cold, mom Pilar was at the stadium to cheer her star son on in person. She previously stole the spotlight during Shedeur Sanders’ NFL debut with a custom t-shirt, and Sunday’s winter-ready look was just as memorable.On the field, Shedeur completed 16-of-25 passes for 149 yards, adding a touchdown and a seven-yard rush. While the Browns fell short against the 49ers, the young quarterback’s potential remains clear.“Very committed to working at it, doing a great job, communicating with coaches, with the players,” Browns coach Kevin Stefanski said of Sanders. “Good work week, but nothing different. I think any player, though, once you get one game under your belt, you got the next one coming. I think it can only help.”Shedeur Sanders is not only focused on proving himself on the field but is also buoyed by the confidence and style of his mom. Whether he maintains the starting role for the rest of the season remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: Pilar Sanders will be there, front and center, cheering him on every step of the way.Also Read: While Drake Maye preps quietly for Giants, wife Ann’s viral gym photo brings unexpected buzz to Patriots fans","Shedeur Sanders made his NFL debut against the San Francisco 49ers on Sunday.

Hunter Henry signed a $6 million contract when his wife Parker Elizabeth Schmidly worked as a labor and delivery nurse

Hunter Henry’s wife Parker says being an NFL wife isn’t all “glitz and glamour”



Also Read:

Parker Elizabeth Schmidly opened up to Kelly Burch of Business Insider, revealing how she balanced her demanding nursing career while her husband, Hunter Henry, sustained in the NFL spotlight. Her journey traces back to the moment she first met the New England Patriots tight end.Parker first crossed paths with Henry at the University of Arkansas, where he was a year ahead of her. As she neared the end of her nursing degree, Henry was drafted by the San Diego Chargers (now, Los Angeles Chargers) in 2016, laying the groundwork for a long-distance romance.Despite the miles between them, their bond grew stronger, leading to their marriage in 2018, the same year Parker proudly graduated as a nurse. For the next two and a half years, she found deep purpose and fulfillment working as a registered labor and delivery nurse.Henry’s career has been marked by steady value growth. He began in June 2016 with a four-year, $6.38 million deal, including nearly $4 million guaranteed and a hefty signing bonus of $2.38 million.By March 2020, he secured a lucrative one-year franchise tag with the Chargers, worth over $10 million.The following year, he landed a three-year, $37.5 million contract with the Patriots, and in March 2024, his performance earned him a $27 million extension in New England.When Hunter joined New England in 2021, Parker hesitated at the thought of leaving for Boston. But as soon as she set foot in Massachusetts, she was struck by how much the spirit of Arkansas resonated, where she and Henry had spent their childhood. The weather felt familiar, and the people proved just as steadfast.When the NFL WAG moved to Massachusetts and discovered she was expecting her son, she hung up her nurse’s scrubs. Her sense of purpose flourished from caring for patients to nurturing her growing family, now soon to include three children. Every now and then, she teases that she might just become a school nurse to keep up with her kids.Parker never misses a home game with her kids, but away games turn into a puzzle. “We can’t travel or even stay with the team, so I need to figure out our flights and accommodations,” she told Burch. No matter how late the night, the team always flies straight home, which means Hunter often walks through the door before Parker and the kids do.Parker hits the road for away games whenever Hunter plays in a city where family or friends await. Otherwise, she and her son turn every away match into a cozy ritual at home. Since he naps from 1 to 3 PM each day, they strike a deal: if the game starts early, he gets to catch the second half after his nap.Parker laughs at the fascination with NFL wives and girlfriends, seeing herself and others as regular people simply “trying to wake up and get through the week.” The “glitz and glam” of being an NFL WAG quickly fades away when “you’re handling the mental load of running a home, getting the kids to school, and packing lunches.”During football season, the tight end is entirely in the dark about the daily happenings at home. With no family nearby, Parker depends on hired help to keep things running smoothly in the house. She even uses a Skylight Calendar, allowing the tight end to catch a glimpse of his son at preschool on special occasions.Now that Parker’s son is older, he eagerly tracks Hunter’s schedule, wanting to know where Daddy is traveling, when he’ll return, and the timing of every game. The calendar helps him bridge the distance and feel his father’s presence even when the tight end is away.",Hunter Henry signed a $6 million contract when his wife Parker Elizabeth Schmidly worked as a labor and delivery nurse.

NHL trade rumors: Elliotte Friedman reports rising interest in Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen as Sabres weigh major goalie move,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/nhl-trade-rumors-elliotte-friedman-reports-rising-interest-in-ukko-pekka-luukkonen-as-sabres-weigh-major-goalie-move/articleshow/125720333.cms,"Trade buzz grows as Sabres weigh next move with Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen (Image via: Getty Images)

Why Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen is Sabres’ most talked-about trade option



Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen Hits Head Off Post After Collision with Jonatan Berggren

The Buffalo Sabres are facing a growing problem in their goaltending situation, and it has pushed Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen into the middle of trade speculation. What began as an attempt to manage three goalies has turned into one of the biggest issues around the team, with long gaps between starts and shaky performances becoming harder to ignore.As the situation drags on, NHL insiders are paying close attention. Elliotte Friedman has pointed to Luukkonen as the main name to watch, especially with the young goalie wanting more consistent playing time. With the Sabres struggling to find a steady rotation, the question is now how long they can wait before making a decision.Since returning to the lineup, Luukkonen has been part of a three-goalie setup with Alex Lyon and Colten Ellis. Instead of helping the team, this plan has led to long breaks between starts for each goalie. Lyon’s recent five-goal outing against the New Jersey Devils after nearly two weeks without playing showed how difficult it is for any goalie to stay sharp under this system.That inconsistency has fueled the trade buzz. On The FAN Hockey Show, Elliotte Friedman said Luukkonen is the goalie attracting the most interest, noting that he wants more chances and has shown enough upside for teams to take notice.While he had a rough game against the Pittsburgh Penguins, he quickly bounced back by stopping 23 of 24 shots against the Winnipeg Jets.Despite injury concerns and uneven stretches, Luukkonen still carries the strongest trade value. Ellis has looked good but is still inexperienced, while Lyon fits better as a reliable backup rather than a full-time starter. Trading Luukkonen would also help open the door for top prospect Devon Levi to take a real step toward earning NHL minutes next season.Pierre LeBrun recently reported that the Sabres are not pushing hard to move him right now. Even so, with interest rising around the league and the rotation failing to settle, the pressure on Buffalo’s front office continues to build. A decision on Luukkonen’s future may be unavoidable as the team looks for stability and a clearer long-term plan in net.Also Read: NHL Update: 2018 Canadian World Junior players back in the game after sexual assault trial acquittal","Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen has been part of a three-goalie setup with Alex Lyon and Colten Ellis.

Gianni Infantino’s net worth and the major football projects he has championed

Also read:

FIFA president Gianni Infantino has landed back in the news, not because of a tournament announcement, but because of a very public shoutout from Donald Trump in Riyadh. During Trump’s busy visit to Saudi Arabia, he introduced Infantino to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman inside the Royal Court and was seen on camera calling him “an excellent guy,” even joking about how good he looked.Infantino, a Swiss-Italian lawyer who rose from working at UEFA to becoming FIFA president in 2016, has only strengthened his position since, winning re-elections in 2019 and 2023. His time in charge has brought major changes: expanded tournaments, World Cups hosted in Russia and Qatar and full support for Saudi Arabia’s successful bid for the 2034 World Cup.As of 2025, Infantino’s net worth is estimated at around 14 million dollars, a figure built from his long career within football’s governing bodies. His compensation package as FIFA president includes a multimillion-dollar salary and bonuses, placing him among the highest-earning executives in global sports. His previous roles at UEFA and years spent navigating the administrative side of football have also contributed to his overall wealth. While he does not come close to the billion-dollar empires seen in ownership circles, Infantino sits firmly in the elite tier of sports executives.Under his watch, FIFA has approved several major moves. The men’s World Cup will expand to 48 teams starting in 2026, making it the largest version in history. He oversaw the awarding of the 2030 World Cup to Spain, Portugal and Morocco, and supported Saudi Arabia’s successful bid for 2034. He has also backed new global competitions, broader development projects and long-term plans aimed at pushing football into new geographic and commercial territory.Heading through 2025, Infantino continues to operate in a space where sport, finance and international visibility overlap. His decisions carry enormous weight, and he remains one of the key figures shaping what the next era of world football will look like.Looking ahead, Infantino is pushing a new wave of projects designed to expand football even more. He is currently overseeing the build-up to the 48-team 2026 World Cup in the United States, Canada and Mexico, which is set to be the biggest tournament FIFA has ever held. He is also supporting new international club events, stronger youth development programs and long-term investment plans focused on countries where the sport is still growing.","FIFA president Gianni Infantino's net worth is estimated at around 14 million dollars.

Klay Thompson is having one of the worst statistical stretches of his career







DaBaby: Yes, he worked with Megan, but his decline in popularity came after multiple controversies unrelated to her.







Tory Lanez: His conviction came from his actions in the 2020 shooting case involving Megan.







Pardison Fontaine: His fade from the spotlight is more about industry cycles than anything Megan-related.







Klay Thompson: His rough season is well documented, but it has nothing to do with Megan.







“This is the first time that I’ve seen a victim who was shot be the one with “bad juju”

“The only real curse here is people refusing to accept responsibility and preferring conspiracy over reality.”

There’s always a new celebrity “curse” flying around the internet, but this week, Akademiks decided to nominate Megan Thee Stallion as the latest target. A clip of him claiming she carries “bad juju” around the men associated with her has gone viral, and honestly, the timelines people are stitching together online are even wilder.

Still, the internet loves patterns, especially messy ones so the conversation exploded instantly.Even though Akademiks presented these situations like a checklist, each case has its own context:Fans pointed out that Ak is mixing real-life outcomes with a dramatic narrative to push the “curse” angle.Twitter comment sections immediately filled up with reactions. Some people joked about the “Meg curse” like it’s the new “Kardashian Curse,” while others called the entire theory lazy and unfair.Many fans argued that:The only verified truth here is that Akademiks actually made this claim, and each man he listed has been publicly tied to Megan in different ways. But there is zero factual evidence connecting her to their downfalls.The “bad juju” angle is simply a viral social-media narrative, not a real pattern.Also read - Klay Thompson names his boat “SS Stallion” after Megan Thee Stallion — fans lose their minds","Akademiks, known for stirring up hip-hop drama, went on a rant accusing Megan Thee Stallion of having “bad juju” that supposedly affects the men who cross paths with her.

Taylor Swift attendance at the Kansas City Chiefs and Houston Texans game becomes the weekend’s biggest NFL question

Taylor Swift entered the Kansas City Chiefs week with a surge of momentum that has nothing to do with football. The Chiefs and Houston Texans game is getting swallowed by the pop star’s latest career milestone after Billboard confirmed her newest hit is now tied for the longest No. 1 run of her career. The timing could not be louder. Kansas City plays at home, Travis Kelce is back in the spotlight, and Taylor Swift arrives at the weekend with a chart win that shifts the entire storyline again.Taylor Swift has been promoting her latest album “The Life of a Showgirl” since Oct. 3. She has spoken publicly about making it during the tour, balancing three-show runs with midweek flights to Sweden, and recording while exhausted but creatively locked in. Her effort has translated into another wave of record breaking numbers that hit just hours before the Chiefs and Texans step on the field.Taylor Swift received confirmation on Dec. 1 that “The Fate of Ophelia” has matched “Anti-Hero” as her longest-running Billboard Hot 100 No. 1. It has now spent eight total weeks at the top of the chart. The reporting from Billboard states that this run is even more significant because holiday music has flooded the top ten. Mariah Carey , Wham, Brenda Lee and Bobby Helms all climbed into the highest positions this week, which normally pushes non-holiday songs down.Taylor Swift held her spot anyway.Billboard credits “The Fate of Ophelia” with 21.6 million streams, 62.1 million radio impressions and 25,000 copies sold in the United States between Nov. 21 and Nov. 27. The track also kept its lead on Streaming Songs, returned to No. 1 on Digital Song Sales and rose to No. 2 on Radio Songs. A Chainsmokers remix released on Nov. 25 reportedly lifted her late November numbers.She told Travis Kelce and Jason Kelce, “I wanted melodies that were so infectious that you were almost angry at it and lyrics that are just as vivid, but crisp and focused and completely intentional.”She also spoke about the toll of creating while touring. “I would be playing three shows in a row, I’d have three days off. I’d fly to Sweden, go back to the tour, and I was pretty exhausted at this point in the tour, but I was so mentally simulated and so excited to be creating.”The success of “The Fate of Ophelia” now positions Taylor Swift at the front of the conversation as the Kansas City Chiefs enter the weekend. The chart news hit before kickoff, and every major outlet reporting on it has pushed her name directly into NFL storylines again.Taylor Swift already holds multiple No. 1s from the last decade. Billboard listed “Anti-Hero,” “Blank Space,” “Cruel Summer,” “Shake It Off,” “Look What You Made Me Do,” “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,” “Fortnight,” “Is It Over Now,” “All Too Well,” “Willow,” “Cardigan” and “Bad Blood” alongside her newest hit. The update notes that Taylor Swift now has thirteen total No. 1 singles. “The Fate of Ophelia” and “Anti-Hero” are her longest leaders, both running for eight weeks.Her latest jump comes as she continues to release content connected to her tour. A new trailer for her Disney Plus docuseries features Taylor Swift delivering an emotional message during her final Eras Tour concert in Vancouver on Dec. 8, 2024. She told the crowd, “We’ve had so long to prepare for the end of this tour, and we get to play one last show for you here tonight.”She followed it with another line that previewed the tone of the upcoming series.“I want to thank every single one of you for being a part of the most thrilling chapter of my entire life to date.”Taylor Swift has attended every Kansas City Chiefs home game this season. The singer has avoided traveling for away games, but she has continued to show up quietly at Arrowhead Stadium. Elle reported on Oct. 29 that Taylor Swift has been keeping a lower profile to avoid drawing excessive attention during Travis Kelce’s season. The magazine confirmed that she has been entering the stadium without being filmed.The Kansas City Chiefs host the Houston Texans, which places Taylor Swift back in play for an appearance. Nothing official has been confirmed, but the pattern is clear. She has attended home games. She has avoided away ones. This is a home game.The next major date on Taylor Swift’s calendar is Dec. 12 when “The End of an Era” premieres on Disney Plus. The six episode series shows behind the scenes footage from her tour, including rehearsals, life on the road and on camera moments with Travis Kelce. It also includes a brand new acoustic set.Taylor Swift also released two full albums during the Eras Tour, “The Tortured Poets Department” in April 2024 and “The Life of a Showgirl” in Oct. 2025. She also re-recorded “Speak Now (Taylor’s Version)” and “1989 (Taylor’s Version)” while traveling globally for the tour. The trailer features Sabrina Carpenter, Gracie Abrams and Ed Sheeran.Her schedule is packed with release dates and promotional cycles, but none of them conflict with the Chiefs and Texans game. Given her attendance pattern, her connection to Kansas City and the timing of her chart milestone, Taylor Swift enters Sunday as the most talked about figure surrounding the matchup.",“The Fate of Ophelia’ has matched “Anti-Hero” as her longest-running Billboard Hot 100 No. 1. It has now spent eight total weeks at the top of the chart. Taylor Swift has attended every Kansas City Chiefs game this season.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125723461,imgsize-89826,width-400,resizemode-4/taylor-swift-chiefs-texans-chart-record.jpg"

Announcing the same, Shams Charania wrote on X:“Danilo Gallinari has retired from basketball after 20 professional seasons, including 16 in the NBA. The No. 6 pick in the 2008 draft out of Italy played 777 career NBA regular season games…”Over the course of his 16-year NBA career, the No. 6 choice in the 2008 draft participated in 777 regular-season games.

To those who believed in me, to all those who supported me, and to those who shared every moment with me – thank you, from the bottom of my heart.

Competitive balance Round A and Round B final order shared by MLB

Round A picks:

Cleveland Guardians

Kansas City Royals

Arizona Diamondbacks

St. Louis Cardinals

Baltimore Orioles

Pittsburgh Pirates

Colorado Rockies



Round B picks:

Milwaukee Brewers

Seattle Mariners

Detroit Tigers

Cincinnati Reds

Miami Marlins

Tampa Bay Rays

Oakland A’s

Minnesota Twins





Teams like Dylan Cease ’s Padres and Kyle Schwarber ’s Phillies may add extra picks

The 2026 MLB Draft order started to take shape on Monday, December 2, 2025, when Major League Baseball shared the full list of Competitive Balance Round A and Round B picks. The top six spots will still depend on the MLB Draft Lottery that will be held on December 9, 2025, in Nashville, Tennessee, but teams now know where they stand in the special rounds. MLB uses a formula that mixes revenue, winning percentage, and market size to decide which clubs get these extra picks. Since 2017, these rounds have helped small-market teams stay competitive. This year, 15 teams will receive picks across the two rounds.MLB confirmed that Competitive Balance Round A will fall between first-round compensation picks and the second round, while Round B will come after the second round ends. The order is based on the 2025 regular-season standings, from best record to worst.These picks are the only Draft picks that MLB teams are allowed to trade. MLB official staff explained again on Monday that these selections cannot be taken away unless the pick has already been traded. One MLB spokesperson said, “These rounds help level the field. Clubs rely on them every year.”Some teams could get more selections once free agents who rejected qualifying offers join elsewhere.MLB rules dictate that after Round 4 the San Diego Padres will now be paid a selection since pitcher Dylan Cease signed a seven-year contract with the Toronto Blue Jays on Sunday, November 30, 2025.Other unsigned players who rejected qualifying offers including Kyle Schwarber, Ranger Suárez, Bo Bichette, Framber Valdez, Edwin Díaz, and Michael King could also cause extra picks depending on where they sign and how much they make.MLB also provided full lottery probabilities for the first six choices; the Chicago White Sox have the best chance at 27.73%.Because MLB rules preclude them this year, the Colorado Rockies, Washington Nationals, and Los Angeles Angels are not eligible.Also Read: Bo Bichette Contract Talks Hit Another Pause After Analysts Explain Major Risks Facing The Toronto Blue Jays","The 2026 MLB Draft order started to take shape on Monday, December 2, 2025, when Major League Baseball shared the full list of Competitive Balance Round A and Round B picks.

Giannis Antetokounmpo’s online activity has caused the Milwaukee Bucks to fear a possible trade

Milwaukee Bucks face rough patch despite Giannis Antetokounmpo’s return and top MVP form

On Tuesday morning, Milwaukee Bucks supporters discovered that Giannis Antetokounmpo 's social media profiles had changed significantly. Except for content from the 2021 championship, the Greek Freak has removed all posts related to the Bucks from his X and Instagram accounts.He only had photos from their NBA Finals and NBA Cup triumphs. Fans of the Bucks, who don't want to see Antetokounmpo traded to another team, naturally became alarmed over this. Giannis Antetokounmpo's most recent social media activity has also made Milwaukee fearful.Antetokounmpo appears to have also updated his bio on X to two words:""NBA athlete.""His conduct has triggered significant trade talk in Milwaukee. The Greek Freak was clearly unhappy in Milwaukee based on his remarks about prioritizing earning a championship during the offseason and his interest in joining the New York Knicks.The Bucks' 2025-26 season was expected to affect Giannis Antetokounmpo's choice about his future. The front administration tried to address its roster difficulties by signing Miles Turner. Thanasis Antetokounmpo, Antetokounmpo's brother, was also signed to a one-year contract.But given how the Bucks have performed this season, they may be close to losing their star player. This season, they are ranked 11th in the Eastern Conference with a 9-13 record. Furthermore, Antetokounmpo has to accomplish even more on both ends without a second star.Despite Giannis' MVP stats, the Bucks have lost three of their last four games. The Washington Wizards were their most recent opponent. Antetokounmpo may have become frustrated after losing to the Wizards, the lowest team in the same conference.The Bucks have lost eight of their last nine games, and after their eighth consecutive setback Friday, Antetokounmpo pushed his squad to embrace a selfless approach in an effort to get things back on track.Antetokounmpo said to ESPN:""Nobody should have a personal agenda. Nobody should worry about what they want from themselves.. Worry only about winning mentality, winning mindset. The more we can win the games, the more everything takes care of itself.""Meanwhile, as of yet, no trade request has been made.Giannis has repeatedly pledged his allegiance to Milwaukee. He wanted to keep with the Bucks and continue to win as part of the organization that first believed in him back when he was a teenager who was still tremendously raw as a basketball player.But in each of the past three seasons, the Bucks departed the playoffs in the first round. They're currently having their worst run in a long time. Milwaukee has lost eight of its last nine games.It doesn't even matter that Antetokounmpo has gotten back on the court from injury. The Bucks continue to have difficulties.Furthermore, Milwaukee hasn't made it past the first round of the playoffs since 2022 due to roster mismanagement and coaching dysfunction, which is an impressive accomplishment. Even Giannis himself hasn't said anything as of yet.Also read: Giannis Antetokounmpo celebrates EuroBasket bronze as Kostas Antetokounmpo faces uncertain NBA future",Giannis Antetokounmpo has removed all posts related to the Milwaukee Bucks from his X and Instagram accounts.

Asmongold reacts to Twitch ad issues after viewer reports and dashboard check

A new controversy has erupted between creators and Twitch and it's spreading across social media after streamer Zack “Asmongold” reacted in disbelief to what he says the platform is paying him for ads on his alternate channel. A short clip from his broadcast has gone viral online, showing him going through his earnings dashboard live and questioning how ads could be running on his stream while he earns almost nothing from them. The moment struck a chord with viewers who say they have seen more ad interruptions lately without any clear explanation.Fans shared the video widely because Asmongold has long been one of the loudest voices when it comes to calling out problems on streaming platforms. This time, the frustration came from his Zackrawrr channel, where he was reviewing recent data and trying to understand why viewers were reportedly seeing ad breaks that did not appear to match his own revenue numbers. The reaction quickly turned into a larger conversation about how Twitch handles ad distribution and payments.During his December 1, 2025, stream, Asmongold pulled up a post from his subreddit in which a viewer claimed that Twitch had paused his livestream for an ad that never appeared and then asked for money to continue watching without interruptions.The viewer wrote, ""Twitch stopping stream for an ad that doesn't exist, to then ask me for money to watch stream uninterrupted.""Surprised, Asmongold clicked into his dashboard to see what was going on. As he scrolled, he read the numbers aloud, saying, ""Ad time per hour - seven seconds! Oh, my god! So, they're cutting down? Now I don't get any fking money! So, they spam ads on my channel... they're running ads on my st, and I don't even get any money. Crazy. 'You don't get (Twitch) Turbo, too?' I don't get Turbo. I don't get anything.""He then checked the revenue breakdown and reacted even more strongly. He said, ""11 cents. What do you mean, 11 cents? Zero dollars. 10 cents. Two cents. I got two pennies! Ad time per hour - seven seconds!""This moment arrived just days after another headline involving the streamer. On November 28, 2025, Asmongold told viewers he would permanently ban anyone who gifted 1,000 Twitch subscriptions to his channel, a gesture that costs $4,990.",Streamer Zack “Asmongold’s” reaction to Twitch ad interruptions has gone viral online.

What was expected to be a gradual return to the lineup has now turned into uncertainty, forcing the organization to rethink its plans on the blue line.According to reports from Maple Leafs insider Mark Masters, the veteran defenseman has left the team and traveled back to Toronto for additional testing. The club has not provided a clear timetable for his return, listing him as out indefinitely as medical staff continue evaluating the issue.This latest setback is another frustrating chapter for the Toronto Maple Leafs, who were counting on Carlo to bring stability and size to their defensive group. Since joining the lineup, the right-shot defenseman has struggled to stay healthy and has made only limited contributions on the scoresheet, appearing in just 18 games this season with two points to his name.The situation has also reignited debate around general manager Brad Treliving’s aggressive trade deadline strategy. To acquire Carlo, the Maple Leafs parted with prized prospect Fraser Minten along with a first-round and fourth-round draft pick.With injuries limiting his availability. Also, critics argue the return on investment has fallen short of expectations so far.From an on-ice perspective, Carlo’s absence leaves Toronto thinner on the blue line. That too, ahead of upcoming NHL match today scenarios and the broader NHL news roundup. The coaching staff may need to rely more heavily on younger defensemen or explore short-term lineup adjustments. While awaiting medical clarity.As the season continues, the Maple Leafs will hope that further testing brings more optimistic results. Until then, Carlo’s uncertain status remains a key storyline in ongoing NHL updates. Thus, shaping both roster decisions. Also, discussions around Toronto’s trade philosophy.Also Read: NHL Update: Brad Marchand and his family hosts Thanksgiving to comfort teammates missing home","Toronto Maple Leafs defenseman Brandon Carlo has experienced a setback in his recovery process.

Anthony Davis Delivers a Three-Word Message to His Former Coach

JJ Redick’s Challenge: Coaching Against His Former Star

Anthony Davis Faces His Old Team in a “Revenge” Matchup

The bonds between NBA players and coaches often extend beyond team changes or on-court battles. Even when careers move in different directions, genuine respect can remain intact - somethingmade clear after he faced off against his former team.Friday’s matchup between the Dallas Mavericks and the Los Angeles Lakers wasn’t just another regular-season game. For Anthony Davis, who was traded last season in one of the biggest deals of the year, it carried emotional weight. Not only was he up against the franchise he once anchored, but he was also competing against JJ Redick, the first NBA head coach he ever played under.Following the Mavericks’ loss to the Lakers, Anthony Davis was asked about Redick and his experience competing against him for the first time since the trade. His response was simple but telling: “That’s my guy.”Davis went on to explain that despite the distance and the changes, his friendship with jj Redick remains solid. The two haven’t had the chance to sit down and talk this season, but Davis recalls a brief conversation they shared in Las Vegas when their teams met earlier. According to him, both indicated interest in having a longer talk at some point.He reflected on their time together during Redick’s debut season as a head coach in 2024-25, describing it as a period where both sides were still learning each other.Davis said Redick was figuring out his coaching style and preferred systems, while he was simultaneously trying to understand the game plans and how they applied to him and the rest of the roster. He made sure to add that despite no longer playing for him, he wishes Redick “the best for sure. ”JJ Redick probably felt conflicted about the game. In his debut season under Redick, Anthony Davis was a force, averaging 25.7 points, 11.9 rebounds, 2.1 blocks, and 1.3 steals per game in 42 games. He contributed significantly to the Lakers' competitiveness prior to the trade deadline by shooting an effective 52.8% from the field.Yet on February 2, the Lakers made the blockbuster decision to send Davis to Dallas in exchange for 26-year-old superstar Luka Doncic - a move that reshaped both franchises.Naturally, Davis entered Friday’s matchup with extra motivation. But while he contributed 12 points, five rebounds, five assists, and three blocks, the Los Angeles Lakers ultimately secured a 10-point win, leaving his revenge incomplete.Also read: NBA star Josh Hart robbed as $185K jewelry heist targets New York Knicks guard in a shocking SoHo incident Still, the bigger takeaway wasn’t the final score.

J.T. Snow says Rafael Devers needs time to Settle at first base



Rafael Devers joined the San Francisco Giants on June 15 in a major trade with the Boston Red Sox. The deal sent Kyle Harrison, Jordan Hicks, James Tibbs III, and Jose Bello to Boston. After the move, the Giants placed Rafael Devers at first base, a spot he rarely played before. Now, a respected voice has shared a calm and direct opinion.On Saturday, former Giants star J.T. Snow spoke about Devers on the show Splash City Territory, hosted by F.P. Santangelo. Snow played 15 MLB seasons, won six Gold Glove Awards from 1995 to 2000, and spent most of his career with the Giants. His thoughts gave fans a better idea of what to expect from Devers at his new position. Snow watched Rafael Devers closely during his first games at first base and shared what he saw. He kept his review simple and honest. His message focused on time, patience, and steady improvement.J.T. Snow shared his full view at the 13:36 mark of the show. He said, “I thought he was good. He made a couple of mistakes early on, but he handled himself well.”Snow explained that learning first base takes time, especially for a player who spent years at third base.Snow added, “If you can play third base, then in time you can go over there and be good. I was impressed.”Snow also spoke about how people often judge too fast. He said, “We’re in such an era now where we’re so quick to judge. One game and people say, ‘Oh, the guy can’t play.’ But give people time.”Snow even joked that if fans watched only his first two games, they might have wondered if he would make it at all. Before joining the Giants, Rafael Devers mostly played third base for the Boston Red Sox.When Alex Bregman arrived in Boston, Devers moved into a designated hitter role. Reports say he was not willing to play first base for the Red Sox, which led to the move to San Francisco.During the same show, J.T. Snow also spoke about the Giants’ top prospect, Bryce Eldridge. The 21-year-old made his MLB debut in September and then had surgery in October to remove a bone spur.Snow said he has seen strong growth in Bryce Eldridge and believes he can become an everyday first baseman. If this happens, Rafael Devers may later shift into a full-time designated hitter role for the Giants.Also Read: Bo Bichette Contract Talks Hit Another Pause After Analysts Explain Major Risks Facing The Toronto Blue Jays","Rafael Devers joined the San Francisco Giants on June 15 in a major trade with the Boston Red Sox.

WNBA’s bold new pay plan offers huge salaries but comes with a risky catch for players,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/wnbas-bold-new-pay-plan-offers-huge-salaries-but-comes-with-a-risky-catch-for-players/articleshow/125724234.cms,"WNBA's recent decision sparked controversy (Image via Getty Images)

WNBA’s new season schedule could create problems with the NCAA and for new players

WNBA plans big salary increases, with top players set to earn $1 million

After more than a year of contentious back-and-forth over CBA negotiations, the WNBA has put a daring new offer on the table. This might drastically restructure player pay and perhaps vault top stars into the seven-figure salary tier.As part of a new collective bargaining agreement, the WNBA has suggested a seven-figure base maximum compensation, but there is a price. According to multiple league sources who spoke with Front Office Sports, the league has eliminated team housing from proposals made to the Women's National Basketball Players Association.The proposal, which was made public by WBB insider Khristina Williams on X, is the league's most aggressive attempt to resolve long-standing complaints over revenue sharing and compensation. The pressure is officially on now that the CBA clock has been extended until January.Williams wrote on X that a source involved with negotiations informed her that the league is proposing a revised compensation system directly related to franchise and league revenue growth. This adjustment has the potential to significantly increase future profits.The official report read:“The WNBA has proposed cutting team housing in addition to an earlier start date, according to multiple sources. The start date for training camp could be as early as mid-March, sources indicated, which would come with serious implications…”Since 2016, teams have been obligated to give players housing during the season.The league has also proposed lengthening the season, including an earlier start date that is expected to collide with the NCAA tournament and maybe other leagues such as Project B.The start date for training camp might be as early as mid-March, sources revealed. The current 44-game regular season runs from mid-May until early September. The 2025 WNBA Finals finished October 10.Meanwhile, the WNBA has declined to respond. Multiple sources have viewed the WNBA’s latest plan as directly interfering with the timing of the NCAA tournament and would see rookies arriving weeks into the season.Salary rises were the focal point of the league's most recent proposal, which was revealed on Monday. A person familiar with the negotiations claims that the league's proposal calls for a maximum base compensation of $1 million, which could rise to $1.2 million due to possible revenue-sharing gains. Additionally, multiple players per squad would be eligible to sign for this supermax base in 2026.It is anticipated that the mean salary will go beyond the mark of $500,000, with less than $225,000 being the lowest salary. The salary cap, which at present stands at $1.5 million for each team, would see an increase up to $5 million. The league’s latest proposal reportedly envisages the salary cap to increase with both league and team revenue without any targets.The new WNBA package is centered on a guaranteed $1 million base salary for max players beginning in 2026. With revenue sharing added, those earnings might approach $1.2 million. The league also wants to lift the average wage to more than $500,000, and increase the team salary cap from $1.5 million to $5 million in the first year.The cap would then increase in accordance with team and league income each year, establishing a clear financial connection between player salary and growth.Also read: Sophie Cunningham unleashes fiery criticism on WNBA commissioner Cathy Engelbert, calling for respect and real change in the league","The WNBA has put a daring new offer on the table for a new collective bargaining agreement.

While Donna revealed no further specifics about the production, her post did suggest it might be a holiday short film or sponsored cinematic campaign. Either way, fans embraced it, calling for more Donna screen time.This moment marks more than entertainment. It reflects a personal chapter for Donna Kelce. Just recently, she shared on the Not Gonna Lie podcast that she once dreamed of aviation. “I did learn how to be a pilot before I had children,” said Donna on the Not Gonna Lie podcast. “So, I actually went up and flew a plane. I did [enjoy it], but you want to have children, and it was really expensive, so I had to stop.” She chose family life, earned an MBA from Baldwin Wallace University, completed studies at Ohio University, then worked three decades in banking as the “major breadwinner in the family. ”Her appearance in The Gift Exchange is not her first on camera. She also showed up in Hallmark productions like Holiday Touchdown: A Chiefs Love Story and Christmas on Call, and called her earlier acting experience “so awesome.” Donna is also preparing for the new season of The Traitors, which adds to her growing media presence.

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has revealed his annual holiday reading list as the 2025 comes to a close. Gates has recommended five books and he believes that all these titles spark curiosity and reflection during the quieter days of the winter season. “Each of these books pulls back the curtain on how something important really works: how people find purpose later in life, how we should think about climate change, how creative industries evolve, how humans communicate,” wrote Gates.In the blog post, Gates has also explained that holidays are the perfect tome to slow down and also catch up on reading. “There’s something about the quieter days around the holidays that makes it easier to sit down with a good book,” he wrote. His list on 2025 book recommendations reflects on his fascination with how the world works and how you can start a great conversation.The book belongs to the fiction genre and its a story of an aging janitor and a wise octopus captive hime with its empathy and storytelling. “Van Pelt's story made me think about the challenge of filling the days after you stop working—and what communities can do to help older people find purpose,” said Gates.The books explains about the climate challenges. The book structures 50 big questions on climate change, nuclear power and renewables. “ I’ve followed Hannah’s work at Our World in Data for years, and her new book is one of the clearest explanations of the climate challenge I’ve read.

The book argues that progress depends not just on good ideas but on the systems that help ideas spread.","Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has revealed his annual holiday reading list as the 2025 comes to a close.

NEW DELHI: MS Dhoni 's impact at Chennai Super Kings has long been hailed for its calmness, loyalty and unmatched leadership — but former CSK star Mike Hussey has now lifted the curtain on a lesser-known side of the franchise: the off-field bonding culture built around Dhoni's open-door hospitality.In a fascinating revelation on The Overlap Cricket podcast, Hussey said Dhoni's room effectively became CSK's unofficial team lounge during every IPL season. Players drifted in and out at all hours, discussing cricket, bantering, sharing meals — and for some, unwinding with shisha.“Dhoni is just the most amazing guy. His room is available open 24 hours a day. Anyone can go up there and just sit. He has got his lounge room, players just sit around, they start talking cricket, some of them like the shisha, you know, the flavoured tobacco stuff. That is their way of socialising. Credit to Dhoni, he opens his room up — lots of players go up, they bring food up, it is fantastic,” Hussey said, offering a glimpse into the camaraderie that defined CSK's IPL dynasty.The anecdote echoes former CSK batter George Bailey 's earlier revelation that Dhoni often hosted relaxed hookah sessions to help younger players settle into the team.Bailey had said Dhoni's informal approach broke down hierarchy and helped create a sense of belonging — a trademark CSK value over the years.Hussey also shared a surprising detail about Dhoni's preparation habits: despite being one of the game's greatest wicketkeepers, he almost never practised the skill in training.“I think the only time I've seen him catch a ball was when we wanted to knock in a new pair of gloves. I've never seen him practise his keeping ever. But he bats a long, long time — he hits thousands and thousands of balls,” Hussey revealed.With Dhoni set to return for IPL 2026 after being retained by the five-time champions, stories like these underline why CSK players past and present continue to call the franchise a “family” — one built on trust, comfort and a legend whose door was literally always open.",Mike Hussey reveals MS Dhoni's open-door hospitality at Chennai Super Kings.

When will Brandon Aiyuk return to the field?

Kyle Shanahan stays hopeful as the San Francisco 49ers await progress

Brandon Aiyuk's circumstances are no longer unclear for the San Francisco 49ers. It's a stressful blend of a knee injury and a contract decision that altered his role with the team. Aiyuk suffered a tear in his ACL, MCL, and meniscus on October 20, 2024, and the subsequent rehab has kept him off the field for more than a year.There's no set date for Aiyuk's return. The 49ers have confirmed that they won't be starting his 21-day practice window during the Week 14 bye, which means there's only a slim four-week window left in the regular season before the playoffs might begin. If the team qualifies for the postseason, that timeline could be pushed back, allowing for more chances to activate him. Still, the main issue is getting medical clearance, as Aiyuk's rehab is going well but isn't at a competitive level just yet.Even with the challenges, Shanahan is still the biggest supporter of Aiyuk's comeback. While chatting on KNBR, the coach shared with host David Bonilla from 49erswebzone, “Oh, I’m definitely still hopeful. I'm not counting on it, but I'm definitely still hoping that can happen."" This statement underscores Shanahan's personal investment in Aiyuk, whom he has praised for his on-field impact and leadership potential, even amid the absences.Shanahan's optimism matches what he and receivers coach Leonard Hankerson said earlier in the offseason, praising Aiyuk's proactive rehab work during training camp.
