NEW DELHI: YouTuber-turned-boxer Jake Paul has once again stirred the combat sports world, this time by calling out MMA icon Conor McGregor for a no-holds-barred MMA fight .Fresh off his unanimous decision victory over 58-year-old Mike Tyson in an eight-round heavyweight bout at AT&T Stadium, Paul wasted no time plotting his next spectacle.On social media platform X, Paul challenged McGregor, dismissing any notions of a boxing match and proposing an open-weight MMA fight.“Just like how it used to be done. But you won’t,” Paul taunted, attempting to lure the former UFC champion into the octagon.McGregor, known for his sharp wit and meme-worthy comebacks, didn’t hold back in his response.Sharing an image of 82-year-old US Senator Mitch McConnell, McGregor quipped, ""Nakisa already rang me, lad, it's this guy next for you. Good luck pal.""The jab quickly went viral, with fans reveling in McGregor’s humor and mocking Paul’s penchant for challenging older, retired athletes.Paul, however, appears unbothered by the backlash.Claiming he earned a staggering $40 million for the Tyson fight, the 27-year-old is riding high on his growing brand and promotional company, Most Valuable Promotions.The organization’s partnership with Netflix reportedly helped the platform reach 60 million households, though not without ruffling feathers among frustrated subscribers.Critics of Paul’s antics have taken to social media to poke fun at his choice of opponents, suggesting a lineup of unlikely candidates, including Clint Eastwood, Jimmy Carter , and Robert De Niro.While the jests highlight the absurdity of Paul’s matchmaking, they also underscore his uncanny ability to generate headlines and buzz.As for McGregor, his response signals a lack of serious interest in Paul’s challenge, at least for now.Yet in the world of combat sports, where money often trumps tradition, the possibility of a blockbuster showdown remains tantalizingly alive.","YouTuber-turned-boxer Jake Paul challenges Conor McGregor for an open-weight MMA fight.

How long will Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, R Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja play?

Former India coach Ravi Shastri , who guided India to historic Test series wins on their last two tours, wants Virat Kohli to fire himself up like he has done on the previous tours Down Under and rediscover his lost touch during the coming Border Gavaskar Trophy (BGT).Holders India will defend the BGT in a five-Test series, beginning with the tour opener in Perth on November 22.Talking about how Kohli, who has been the subdued version of himself over the past few years, Shastri said Kohli ""needs to"" bring his aggression to the fore once again.""You mellow with age, don't you? But I think at the start of the Test series, you might just see (Kohli) firing again. He needs to be, I'd like to see him (like that) again,"" said Shastri, who was the coach when Kohli captained India to first ever Test series win on the Australian soil in 2018-19.Kohli has not been on the top of his game in the post-Covid era, with just two hundreds coming off his bat in the last 60 innings. Lately, in the Test series against Bangladesh and New Zealand at home before flying to Australia , Kohli aggregated just 192 runs in 10 innings.Shastri felt facing Australia in Australia might just spur the 36-year-old Kohli on and bring him back into his own, and the same goes for Australia veteran Steve Smith.""In the face, that's Kohli,"" said Shastri. ""Come Australia, he'll get his juices going. It's (about) how he starts off, and for Australia, it's with Steve Smith. These guys, don't write them off – because if they get cracking in the first two or three innings, they'll have a good series.""",Former India coach Ravi Shastri wants Virat Kohli to fire himself up in Australia.

NEW DELHI: Nathan McSweeney has been tasked to open on his Australia debut despite not being a specialist in that position but David Warner believes the young batter has got the technique and expects him to score big.The first Test of the blockbuster Border-Gavaskar Trophy begins on November 22 in Perth and debutant McSweeney is all set to share the opening responsibilities alongside Usman Khawaja Up against the likes of pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj, McSweeney has his task cut out in the debut Test series but Warner believes that it is a great time for the 25-year-old to test himself at the highest level.“Nathan McSweeney’s got a good technique (and) we know he can bat for long periods of time,” Warner told Fox Sports.“And then (there’s) Steve Smith and Marnus Labuschagne, who probably in their right mind, are overdue for some runs.“I think Marnus is really up for the series; I’m hoping that he has a big series for Australia.”“It’s a great time for him (McSweeney) to come in; it’s a big series,” Warner continued.“I think he’s got the technique (and) the patience to partner up with Uzzie to allow himself to score big.Since Warner's retirement in January this year, there has been no firm contender to partner Khawaja at the top. Steve Smith had initially stepped into the role of opener but he failed to shine and will revert to his usual No. 4 slot, behind Marnus Labuschagne.McSweeney, who usually plays at number three for his state Queensland, has now been tasked to open and Warner wants the Australian side to be patient with the youngster.“I’ve pencilled him (McSweeney) in for the highest run score this (summer), so I’m looking forward to that. I’m also looking forward to seeing how he adapts batting with someone like Usman Khawaja as well, because it’s a partnership that you have to build.“We’ve just got to be patient with all the guys that are coming through now. Uzzie is touching on 38 now as well, he’s probably got another 12 to 18 months to go.“He’s (McSweeney) 25 years of age; you’ve got to give guys a crack … it’d be exciting just to see him score some runs first (and) establish himself — but if he doesn’t, just give him some time, give him maybe two summers,” Warner added.",David Warner believes Nathan McSweeney has got the technique to open for Australia. The 25-year-old will open with Usman Khawaja in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy series.

'KL Rahul is going to unleash himself in the next three to five years'

NEW DELHI: David Warner has issued a cautionary note to Pat Cummins and the Australian team about the potential impact of Virat Kohli in the upcoming Border-Gavaskar Trophy . Despite Kohli's recent struggles in international cricket, Warner believes the Indian stalwart remains a significant threat.Over the past five years in Test cricket, the 36-year-old Kohli has managed only two centuries. His recent form includes just one fifty in his last 10 innings, and in six Test matches this year, he averages slightly above 22.As India prepare to face Australia in the opening Test in Perth on November 22, Warner urged Australia not to underestimate Kohli, emphasizing his ability to rise to the occasion.""I'm worried about Virat Kohli … but not for the reasons everyone else is. I've seen this before. People want to write Virat off after India's disastrous 3-0 Test series loss to New Zealand this month, but I'm actually worried for Australia,"" Warner expressed in his Herald Sun column.""This is the Border-Gavaskar Trophy and we know Virat always steps up in Australia and completely embraces that challenge like almost no one else who has ever visited our shores. There is no better way for him to come out and shut the critics up,"" Warner continued.Warner further stated, ""I'm genuinely worried for the Australian cricket team that he's going to come out and pile on some runs. For Australia's sake I hope he doesn't, but I think he will thrive on the fact he hasn't done so well for a while and he's got a point to prove.""""Virat is also in unchartered territory, because never before has he really ever had a form slump in his entire career. People want to marry that up with his age (he turned 36 earlier this month) and what not, but he's still a world-class player and all great players go through these dry times and come out the other side. Especially if you're as talented and determined as Kohli,"" Warner noted.""This will definitely be the last time we see Virat in Australia in Test match whites which is something we should all savour. Virat has always been the person they rely heavily on to score runs and more often than not in Australia he has proven up for the contest,"" he concluded.Kohli's record in Australia stands impressive with over 1,300 runs and six centuries in 13 Tests.",Virat Kohli has had a poor run of form in international cricket. The 36-year-old has scored just two centuries in the past five years.

Virat & Rohit’s Home Struggles: Left-Arm Spin & Lost Intent? | Beyond the Boundary Highlights

""I don't know why people were after me. I don't know why people have been questioning my technique or temperament so much.""With eyes that were holding back tears that could flood the Pacific, this was 23-year-old Virat Kohli speaking to the media in Perth in January 2012. He had just top-scored with 44 on a bouncy WACA pitch in a shambolic Indian innings of 161 on Day One of the third Test during a series that resembled a horror show for India.Kohli's emotional burst was in response to a tweet by a former cricketer who had posted on Testeve, ""Give Kohli another game just to be sure he does not belong here.""Perth showed that Kohli belonged. He top-scored with 75 in the second innings too as India were dismissed for 171 to lose by an innings and plenty during a 4-0 shellacking.Cut to 2024. The Indian great is back at the venue where he first established his credentials as a Test batter. Can the WACA, where the Team India is camping for match simulation and preparing for the opening contest of theBorder Gavaskar Trophy at the nearby Optus Stadium from Friday, be the venue for his renaissance too?A look at the Australian media, which often doesn't hesitate to play 12th man for the team, makes you believe so. India's arrival in Australia was announced with glowing full-page write-ups on Kohli in some of the leading Australian publications with Hindi and Punjabi headlines.So what if he has scored only two centuries in the last five years and his average, once a proud 55, has plummeted to 47.83?Ironically, the same media had painted him as a villain when the batter flicked the bird at a section of a raucous Sydney crowd which was giving him grief on the boundary.The prickly 23-year-old was mercilessly sledged by the Aussie players too during his maiden Test hundred in Adelaide in the fourth Test. ""To give it back verbally and then score a hundred is even better,"" he said in the presser after his 116.In the same interaction, he slammed the SCG crowd too.""Don't get drunk and abuse players."" Touche. Perth and Adelaide 2012 had given Kohli his passport to stardom. Adelaide 2014, though, was a visa to greatness. Leading India for the first time, he struck a hundred in each innings. (115, 141). The second ton was a clinic in mastering spinning conditions.It also offered fans a window into his captaincy style: ""Play to win."" India made a spirited dash at the target of 364 and fell 48 short. The crowds lapped up Kohli's spunk. The spicy duels with Mitchell Johnson , especially during his 169 in the Boxing Day Test at MCG, were peak cinema.At one point he drove Johnson straight, only to see the bowler stop the ball in his follow through and hurl it back to hit him. Kohli followed up by drilling Johnson through cover and blowing a kiss.A Kohli press conference was the place to be at after such antics. Sample this: ""There's no good reason that I should respect some people when they are not respecting me."" Or this: ""They were calling me a spoilt brat, and I said, 'That's the way I am. You guys hate me. I like that.'""More? ""I like playing against Australia because it is very hard for them to stay calm. I don't mind an argument. They don't seem to be learning the lesson.""Kohli was all passion and fire in 2014. Four years later, he married maturity with those traits. Already the world's premier attacking batter across formats, Kohli showed how much he could romance struggle in the second Test as he compiled 123 off 257 balls at the Optus in hellish batting conditions.After driving Mitchell Starc down the ground to reach three figures, he pointed to the bat, opened and closed his fist to say, 'My bat talks now.'India lost the Test but won the 2018 series 2-1. Ex-players had begun to hail Kohli as the ideal brand ambassador for Test cricket when it was being challenged by shorter formats. When Australia welcomed him again at the height of the Covid pandemic in Dec 2020, it was already announced that Kohli would play only the first Test, the pink ball D/N fixture at Adelaide.Interestingly, his favourite venue had even offered to host his wedding in 2017. Kohli produced yet another defensive classic, a solid 74 off 180 balls before a misunderstanding with Ajinkya Rahane saw him get run out and limit India's first innings total.India were infamously bowled out for 36 in the second innings to lose that Test. And though under Rahane, they won an epic series 2-1, Kohli had nothing to do with that triumph. He was in India for the birth of his first child.In the twilight of his career now, and with peers going past him in the quest for batting immortality, can Kohli summon one last effort and reclaim his aura in the land where he earned it first.Now, only if the Aussies stopped being so nice to him.","Virat Kohli is back at the venue where he first established his credentials as a Test batter. The 23-year-old has scored only two centuries in the last five years and his average, once a proud 55, has plummeted to 47.83. The WACA, where the Team India is camping for match simulation, is the venue for the opening contest of theBorder Gavaskar Trophy.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115433268,imgsize-43600,width-400,resizemode-4/115433268.jpg"

Bumrah's awkward action, deceptive pace and ability to swing the ball both ways can instil fear in the hearts of Australian batsmen, who are gearing up to face the right-arm pacer in the first Test beginning November 22 in Perth.

'HE IS EXCEPTIONAL'

If there's one player, other than Virat Kohli, who has drawn the most attention ahead of the coming Border Gavaskar Trophy (BGT) in Australia, it's India's bowling spearhead and vice-captain Jasprit Bumrah , whom 'Fox Cricket ' described as the first visiting fast bowler ""since the golden era of the West Indies in the 1970s"" to have ""struck fear into the hearts of Australians"".Not just the leader of India's attack, Bumrah has also led the revolution in the country's fast-bowling history by excelling in different countries, all formats and on varying pitches, including the tracks at home and in the subcontinent that favour the spinners. That's where his skills and contribution stand out.And when it comes to Australia, he just smacks his lips and ""tiptoes"" in to deliver those unplayable lines and lengths while swinging the ball both ways at upwards of 140kmph, with a toe-crushing yorker quietly slipped in.His 32 wickets at an average of 21.25 during India's historic back-to-back triumphs on their last two tours of Australia were central to those victories.'Fox Cricket' went knocking at the door of some of Australia's leading batters, who will be part of the five-match BGT commencing with the first Test at the Optus Stadium in Perth from November 22, to ask what it is like to face Bumrah.""Impossible"" - replied batter Travis Head when asked about his experience of batting against the Indian pacer. ""You try to feel like you're one step ahead, but it always feels like he's that next step. Any format of the game, he's incredible. He's their X-factor, he's the guy they go to every time; and more often than not, he's able to produce for them. In big moments you want big players, and I think he's their biggest.""You have got your work cut out as a batter. He's someone that's going to be difficult over summer,"" he added.Highlighting Bumrah's awkward stiff-arm delivery stride at the end of a short run-up that begins with a tip-toe walk, opening batter Usman Khawaja compared Bumrah to Mitchell Johnson.""When I first faced Bumrah, I was like, 'Oh where did that come from?'"" said Khawaja.""It comes at you a little bit quicker than you expect because of the awkwardness of his action and how he releases the ball, much like Mitchell Johnson; he had a weird action too. The ball used to come out and felt like it got to you quicker because you didn't get a look at it the whole way. Jasprit is a little bit the same, with arms going everywhere.""Australia's former captain Steve Smith has enjoyed a fair bit of success against Bumrah, but he said it's especially not easy to face him for the first few deliveries because of his ""awkward"" bowling action.""He's just awkward with the way he bowls. It's obviously very different to a lot of other people. It takes a little bit getting used to. I have played against him quite a lot now, and it still takes a couple of balls to get used to the different rhythm.""Former Australia all-rounder Shane Watson explained to 'Fox Cricket' how Bumrah manages to generate so much pace from a short run-up that does not include running at speed.""He is not reliant on run-up speed, so he is not reliant on the real physicality of running in, which is normally where a lot of fast bowlers get tired, while he just tiptoes in,"" said Watson. ""But because of his freakish co-ordination, the ball just flies out of his hand.""Watson added: ""His release point’s different as well. His release point is way in front of the crease, so it actually feels like he's bowling nearly on top of you. There's a shorter gap between the ball coming out and the ball hitting your bat.""Watson, who retired from all forms of cricket in 2020, shared his experience of facing Bumrah, when he used to rely more on deliveries swinging in.""From when I first faced him, he was only an in-swing bowler with variations of speed in T20 cricket, but now for the last number of years, he swings it both ways at speed,"" he said. ""The batters who score runs against him, they are absolutely going to be at their very best, because he's that good."" Marnus Labuschagne was the top-scorer in the last BGT played in Australia, scoring 426 runs and therefore had a fair measure of Bumrah during those eight innings four summers ago.Like some of his fellow batters in the Australia squad, Labuschagne also highlighted the element of surprising speed that Bumrah generates and then backs it up by controlling his line, length and swing to perfection.""His run-up doesn't match the speed he bowls, so you can get done by the pace a little bit if he's just skidding it through,"" said the Australian. ""He can swing the ball both ways, he can nip it, and because he's a class bowler, he's got a bouncer up his sleeve so he can use that as well to put you under pressure.""Whether he goes out-swing or in-swing, I don't think the seam moves. It's straight. To be the best in India, where they love cricket, you've got to be exceptional, and that's what he is,"" Labuschagne concluded.Bumrah will lead India in the first Test of this BGT because the designated skipper Rohit Sharma, who became a father recently, will be unavailable for the game in Perth.","Jasprit Bumrah is India's bowling spearhead and vice-captain. The right-arm pacer is the first visiting fast bowler since the golden era of the West Indies in the 1970s to have ""struck fear into the hearts of Australians"" He has taken 32 wickets at an average of 21.25 during India's historic back-to-back triumphs on their last two tours of Australia.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115433383,imgsize-39334,width-400,resizemode-4/115433383.jpg"

A tour of Australia is often the toughest challenge in world cricket, testing players with world-class opposition, rock-hard pitches, sprawling outfields, hostile crowds and an unrelenting media. Yet, some Indian players have come through the test of fire and emerged with flying colours.India's five-Test series in Australia was a forgettable 4-0 thrashing. Yet, it unearthed two stars legends. Sachin Tendulkar, an 18-year-old prodigy, announced himself with a stellar unbeaten 148 in Sydney and a brave 114 on the bouncy Perth track. His 368 runs were the highest for India in the series.Srinath bowled with pace and bounce, showing immense promise. Though his 10 wickets at 55.30 didn't reflect his impact, he displayed the raw talent that would make him India's pace spearhead.Amid a disappointing series, VVS Laxman carved out one of his finest knocks. His scintillating 167 off 198 balls at the SCG stood out for its elegance and dominance against a formidable Australian attack. It was a counter-attacking masterpiece that earned him respect from fans and foes.At just 19, Irfan Pathan made his debut in the second Test in Adelaide on the 2003-04 tour. Bowling with reverse swing and precision, he dismissed legends like Steve Waugh and Adam Gilchrist, hinting at his immense potential despite modest returns (4 wickets at 66.50).Known for his audacious strokeplay, Sehwag lit up the MCG with a swashbuckling 195 off 233 balls. Though he missed a double ton, his knock left an indelible mark, cementing his reputation as a fearless opener.Ishant Sharma, all of 19, produced one of the most memorable spells at the WACA, tormenting Ricky Ponting with pace, bounce, and relentless accuracy and eventually dismissing the Australian skipper in both innings. This fiery spell not only helped India win the Test but also changed Ishant's career trajectory.Pujara was the cornerstone of India's historic first series win in Australia. Scoring 521 at 74.42 with three centuries and facing 1258 deliveries, Pujara's marathon knocks blunted Australia's attack, frustrated bowlers and helped India achieve a landmark 2-1 victory.During the 2020-21 tour, Pujara was again his resolute self, scoring three half-centuries to play a key role in India's 2-1 triumph. Overall, the No. 3 batsman has made 993 runs in 11 Tests across three tours, facing a total of 2657 balls!In the 2011-12 tour, a young Virat Kohli stood tall amidst India's 4-0 whitewash, scoring his maiden Test hundred (116) in Adelaide. It was a gallant knock that showcased his grit and determination. By the 2013-14 series, Kohli had evolved into a leader and batting maestro. As captain, he led with intent, scoring 692 runs at 86.50, including four centuries.Touring Australia for the first time, Rishabh Pant impressed with 350 runs, including a brilliant 159* at the SCG. In 2020-21, Pant became a phenomenon. His heroic 97 in Sydney saved a Test, while his unbeaten 89 in Brisbane helped Ajinkya Rahane & Co. pull off an incredible heist - a 329-run chase on the fifth and final day as Australia lost a Test at the Gabba for the first time since 1988. India won the series 2-1.Mohammed Siraj, shouldering the pace attack amid injuries, took 13 wickets, including a five-wicket haul (5/73) in Brisbane, despite grappling with personal tragedy.Shubman Gill, making his Test debut, scored 259 runs at 51.80. While many remember Pant for the Gabba heist, Gill's 91 while opening the innings was equally crucial.","India's five-Test series in Australia was a forgettable 4-0 thrashing.

NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli 's exceptional record in Australian cricket is well-documented. In his 13 Test matches on Australian soil, he has scored 1352 runs at an impressive average of 54.08, including six centuries and four half-centuries.Interestingly, Kohli's most cherished innings came in a losing cause. His remarkable 123-run performance in Perth during the 2018-19 Border-Gavaskar Trophy , which included 13 boundaries and one six, stands as his finest achievement in Australia.The Perth cricket ground , renowned for being the world's quickest and most bouncy pitch, presents significant challenges for batsmen. This context makes Kohli's high regard for his performance at this venue quite understandable.""My best knock in Australia will definitely be my 100 at Perth. 2018-19 series that we played. I thought that was the toughest pitch that I played on in Test cricket. It was great to get a hundred on that tour,"" Kohli said in a video uploaded by the BCCI titled ""Ask the Next One"".Despite Kohli's brilliant century, India suffered a 146-run defeat in that match.The series saw India, captained by Kohli, secure victory in the first Test by 31 runs, followed by the Perth loss.They bounced back to win in Melbourne by 137 runs and drew in Sydney, clinching the four-match series 2-1.This victory marked India's first-ever Test series win on Australian territory.",Virat Kohli has scored 1352 runs at an impressive average of 54.08 in 13 Test matches on Australian soil.

NEW DELHI: Team India would be eyeing their third successive Test series win on the trot in Australia and the Aussies would be looking to go all guns blazing to stop the Indians in their bid in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy .With captain Rohit Sharma set to miss the first Test in Perth, pressure will be on rest of the Indian batters to come good in the series.And the maximum pressure undoubtedly will be on India batting mainstay and former captain Virat Kohli With 6 hundreds from 13 Tests in Australia at an average of 54.08, Kohli has a phenomenal record in Australia but has averaged merely 22.72 in six matches in 2024, the lowest in his career.Former Australia captain Michael Clarke picked Virat Kohli and flamboyant keeper-batter Rishabh Pant to play decisive roles for India to win the series in Australia.""Virat Kohli's record in Australia in phenomenal. I actually think his record is better than what it is in India. I think he's got six hundreds in 13 Tests in Australia,"" Clarke says during an interview.The 36-year-old Kohli has scored just one fifty this year - 70 against New Zealand in the second innings of the first Test at Bengaluru, while his last Test century came in July 2023 against the West Indies.With India set to play the first Test in Perth from November 22, Kohli can hope to strike form from the word go.Kohli has till now played two Tests in Perth - one at the WACA in which he scored 44 and 75 in the two innings in January 2012 which Australia won by an innings and 37 runs.The second Test that Kohli played in Perth was as captain in 2018 and he became the first batsman to score a Test hundred at the new Perth stadium as he scored his 25th Test century at the age of 30.Clarke continues, ""If India are to win this series, it has to be Virat Kohli leading run scorer with Rishabh Pant just behind.""During the fourth and final Test of India's last tour of Australia at the Gabba in January 2021, Rishabh Pant played one of the most iconic innings in Test cricket history.Pant played a fearless, match-winning knock, scoring an unbeaten 89 off 138 balls to chase down 328 runs on the fifth day as India achieved a record-breaking victory at the Gabba, a venue where Australia had been undefeated in Tests for 32 years.The innings highlighted Pant's fearless approach and unyielding belief, even under immense pressure. His aggressive mindset, combined with clever shot selection, helped India pull off one of the greatest chases in Test cricket.This was a major moment in his career and elevated his status as a cricketer who thrives in high-pressure situations and uses his attacking play style to turn games.India need to win 4 Tests in Australia to directly qualify for the World Test Championships final that is scheduled to be held at Lord's in June 2025.",Former Australia captain Michael Clarke picked Virat Kohli and Rishabh Pant to play decisive roles for India to win the series in Australia.

By Round 4, Tyson’s fatigue became evident, and Paul exploited the opportunity, landing precise body shots and controlling the pace.Heading into the final rounds with a slim 48-47 lead, Paul maintained his composure. Despite the crowd’s chants urging Tyson to mount a comeback, the 27-year-old boxer continued to dictate terms, ultimately securing a unanimous decision.

Dhruv Jurel Makes a Solid Impression With Gritty 80 vs AUS at the MCG

India opted for closed-door practice sessions in Perth ahead of the series-opening Test of the Border Gavaskar Trophy (BGT), and former Pakistan batter Basit Ali feels it shows that the Indian team isn't confident about their title-defence.India have had a strong hold on the BGT, thwarting Australia's challenge for a decade. India's reign also includes historic triumphs Down Under on their last two tours.But going into this BGT, India haven't shown consistent red-ball form and got washed out 0-3 in the home Test series against New Zealand before flying to Australia. Add to that the woeful form of their star batters Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma , the problems seem compounded.India flew to Australia without Rohit, who recently became father again, and he won't be available for the opening match of the five-Test series. The visitors canceled their official warm-up match against India 'A' to spend more time in the nets and played an intra-squad match, which were hidden from public view at the WACA stadium.Before that, wicketkeeper-batsman Dhruv Jurel, was flown to Australia early to play in the unofficial Test between India A and Australia A in Melbourne. Grabbing the opportunity, Jurel stuck in to impress with knocks of 80 and 68 in the two innings to knock at the doors of head coach Gautam Gambhir for a place in the eleven for the Perth Test.""My personal opinion is that Jurel, who is in form, should be included in the playing eleven,"" said Basit in a video on his YouTube channel. ""In Australia, whosoever is in form should be played...So what if he (usually) bats at No. 5 or 6! Push him to No. 3. He has guts, is a good player of the cut and pull shots. It might pay.""Basit added that close-door practice sessions only show that India's confidence is low.""The Indian team's confidence at the moment is down. Chhup ke toh practice kar rahe hain, maafi ke saath bolna pad raha hai (they are practising behind closed doors, sorry to say that)...The kind of preparation they should have had before the series is not there, whether you reach 12 days before or 12 months before (the tour). This is not the way. They should have played (warm-up) matches and tackled their (Australian) bowling,"" he reckoned.Before ending his views on the Indian team's readiness, Basit had a piece of advice for Virat Kohli, who hasn't been at the top of his form, especially in Test cricket.""Let me give one piece of advice. I think Khaleel (Ahmed) is there. Practice more against the left-arm (fast) bowler, especially Virat Kohli,"" he said, before adding that he is looking forward to the race between Kohli and former Australia captain Smith.""I want to see who scores more runs between Virat Kohli and Steve Smith. Will Virat score 400 runs in the series?

NEW DELHI: The forthcoming Border-Gavaskar Trophy stands as a critical series for India's head coach Gautam Gambhir . His tenure has witnessed significant setbacks, including India's first ODI series defeat to Sri Lanka in 27 years, followed by a home Test series loss to New Zealand after 12 years.The former opening batsman now faces substantial pressure ahead of the Australia series.Former India spinner Harbhajan Singh has shared his perspective on the significance of the upcoming Australian tour for Gambhir.""Ever since Gautam has become the coach, he has not gone out there to bat, neither he has gone out to bowl. Suddenly he has become the coach and the results have gone down. The entire blame is being pinned on Gautam Gambhir,"" Harbhajan told Jatin Sapru on the his YouTube channel.""He has not batted or bowled, the blame cannot be put on him. Your plan was to have turners, and the plan backfired. Knowing him, I think he has his heart in the right place. He always thinks about the team, it is way too early for us to judge him. Give him time. It is not easy to run big teams,"" he added.Harbhajan further expressed his thoughts about how the five-match series against Australia would assess Gambhir's composure.""It is difficult to run big teams, everyone takes time. If the results were fine, everyone would have said 'see, Gautam is making the team win'. The series against Australia is important, a lot of things will be tested. Gautam Gambhir who will be sitting outside, his anger and patience will be tested,"" said Harbhajan.""He cannot control anything from the outside, big players get frustrated sitting on the sidelines.

Aussie top order not in best form

Conflicted about waking up early on Friday for the start of the Border Gavaskar Trophy? You clearly have a reason after what happened over the last one month in India, when Rohit Sharma's boys were handed a 0-3 humiliation by New Zealand at home.The World Test Championship Final berth, which looked likely before the start of the season, now looks a distant dream as Australian pacers lick their lips on a spicy Perth surface, known for its tennis-ball bounce.But if you can look through the mist of disappointment, you may figure a hint of silver lining as the Indian side prepares for a response. What exactly should give the Indian cricket fan some hope ahead of this massive challenge?It's the Indian pace attack, which is one of the best in the business. In Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Siraj , Akash Deep , Prasidh Krishna and Harshit Rana , the fast bowlers have all the ingredients to do well in Australia. This lot hardly had a role to play in the New Zealand debacle as the spinners called the shots on surfaces which were a little too spin-friendly for everybody's liking.The pitches in Australia will be completely different. The crucial thing about bowling in Australia is to understand the lengths to hit. While Bumrah, arguably the best paceman in the world across formats, has all the experience, Siraj, too, is a perfect fit for the fast and bouncy tracks. If Mohammed Shami can return sometime later on in the series, it will be the icing on the cake.Bumrah had 21 wickets in the 2018-19 series win. In Brisbane in January 2021, Siraj got 5-73 in the second innings that kept India's target to manageable proportions and allowed Rishabh Pant to go for that almighty chase.""Akash Deep has shown that he can be equally effective both against right-handers and lefthanders. He should be the third pacer and if there is a little bit of help for the seamers, all three can be as good as their Aussie counterparts,"" former India paceman L Balaji, who has experience of touring Down Under, told TOI.Balaji, who was edged out by Morne Morkel for the bowling coach's job a couple of months ago, wants India to play with only four bowlers in the first Test, the fourth being Ravindra Jadeja ""You don't need more than four bowlers on a spicy surface in Australia. The batters have to give a minimum of 250 to allow the bowlers to stay in the fight and for that, a proper batter at No. 7 is necessary,"" Balaji said.That brings us to the most crucial issue, the batting frailties of India in recent times. On a pitch which had a bit of help for pacers in Bengaluru in the first Test against New Zealand, India were bowled out for 46 by the Kiwi pacers, and the Aussie team management must have taken note of that.Having said that, the Australian top-order isn't in the best of form. While Usman Khawaja, in all probability, is playing his last home series, the hosts have a new makeshift opener in Nathan McSweeney, who will be making his debut in Perth. Marnus Labuschagne and Steve Smith haven't been in great form either, while Mitchell Marsh hasn't been too much of a headache for Indian bowlers ever. That leaves the top-order with Travis Head, a real thorn in the flesh for India in recent times, and a dependable wicketkeeper-batter Alex Carey.But if we have to do a man-to-man analysis, is Carey a better bet than Pant? You can make your own calculations. Add to that the fact that this Australian team, not too long ago, lost a Test against lowly West Indies at home, that exposed all the frailties in their batting.""The Indian bowling attack is perfectly capable of keeping this Australian batting line-up to a score of below 250, especially when there is a bit of help. From there on, it can become a batters' game and the likes of Kohli, Pant, Yashasvi Jaiswal and Shubman Gill (though out of first Test with finger injury), have the capability to score big in Australia,"" Balaji said.It's not going to be easy, but then, historically, when has a tour of Australia been smooth sailing? Be it Melbourne in 1980-81, Perth in 2007-08 or Brisbane in 2020-21, India hit back really hard when the chips were truly down. The Aussies too know that this Indian lot is made of some stern mettle and they experienced that first-hand twice at home not too long ago. Will the trend continue?",India take on Australia in first Test of Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Perth. Rohit Sharma's side were beaten 0-3 by New Zealand at home. India's fast bowlers have all the ingredients to do well in Australia. Australia's top-order is not in best form.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115399180,imgsize-78458,width-400,resizemode-4/115399180.jpg"

'KL Rahul is going to unleash himself in the next three to five years'

NEW DELHI: Former India head coach Ravi Shastri has advised Team India to move past their 0-3 defeat to New Zealand and concentrate on upcoming Border-Gavaskar Trophy against Australia.The unprecedented whitewash under Rohit Sharma 's leadership marked India's first home Test series defeat in 12 years, significantly impacting their ICC World Test Championship standings position.Shastri maintains a positive outlook regarding India's prospects of qualifying for the World Test Championship Final at Lord's next year, encouraging the team to maintain an optimistic approach.""India will be smarting from that defeat in the series against New Zealand because they were caught unawares. They were a little complacent and paid the price for it. That said, this Indian team is a very proud one,"" Shastri said during the latest episode of The ICC Review.To secure a place in the World Test Championship Final, India need to win four out of five matches in Australia. Their campaign begins with the first Test in Perth on November 22.India's previous success in making strong starts during away tours is noteworthy, particularly during their 2018/19 Australian tour, where they achieved their first opening Test victory, defeating Australia by 31 runs in Adelaide, with Cheteshwar Pujara scoring a remarkable century.Shastri stressed the significance of beginning the Australia tour positively to restore momentum.""They would be hurting, and they'll want to get back on track as soon as possible. The best way to bounce back from such a series is to start another one strongly. So, the first two Tests become extremely crucial,"" he stated.The 62-year-old advised the team management to concentrate on previous achievements and take inspiration from their successful Australian tours.India achieved their first Test series victory in Australia in 2018 under Virat Kohli 's captaincy, subsequently replicating this success in 2021 despite the absence of several key players.""The key will be to ensure they start well and keep the players in a good frame of mind. That will be the coach's most important task,"" Shastri added.He highlighted the potential role of India's batsmen in establishing an early advantage.""Confidence is key. They must focus on the positives, think about what they achieved in Australia last time, and build on that. Put the New Zealand loss behind them.

Squad:

NEW DELHI: Mohammed Shami will represent Bengal in the upcoming Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy , as announced in the squad released by the Cricket Association of Bengal on Monday.Following his extended injury break, the Indian fast bowler is preparing for his second consecutive domestic competition, having recently participated in Bengal's Ranji Trophy match against Madhya Pradesh in the fifth round.During that match, Shami demonstrated his prowess by taking seven wickets, including three top-order batsmen and four lower-order players, across approximately 44 overs. He also contributed significantly with the bat, scoring 36 runs.His form is a positive sign for Team India, which is heading to Australia with a relatively inexperienced pace attack for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy series, starting next week in Perth.Shami's return to domestic cricket marked an important step in his comeback journey. He had been in sensational form during the ODI World Cup 2023, finishing as the tournament's leading wicket-taker with 24 wickets in seven matches at an average of 10.70, including three five-wicket hauls.His best performance came in the semi-final against New Zealand, where he claimed 7/57. However, after India's heartbreaking loss to Australia in the final, the team redeemed themselves with a T20 World Cup win in the Caribbean, though Shami was forced to watch from the sidelines due to injury.With his domestic cricket return, Shami will be looking to reclaim his spot in the Indian team ahead of the ICC Champions Trophy and the Indian Premier League in 2025.If included in the squad for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, Shami's experience would be invaluable, particularly given India's inexperienced pace attack. The bowling line-up features Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Siraj, and promising talents such as Harshit Rana, Prasidh Krishna, all-rounder Nitish Kumar Reddy, and Akash Deep.Shami has an impressive Test record in Australia, with 31 wickets in eight matches at an average of 32.16, including best figures of 6/56.Sudip Kumar Gharami (C), Abishek Porel (wk), Sudip Chatterjee, Shahbaz Ahmed, Karan Lal, Writtick Chatterjee, Ritwick Roy Chowdhury, Shakir Habib Gandhi (wk), Ranjot Singh Khaira, Prayas Ray Barman, Agniv Pan (wk), Pradipta Pramanik, Saksham Chaudhary, Mohammed Shami, Ishan Porel, Mohammed Kaif, Suraj Sindhu Jaiswal, Sayan Ghosh, Kanishk Seth and Soummyadip Mandal.",Mohammed Shami will represent Bengal in the upcoming Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy.

When Andrej Kramarić hit the post and Josko Gvardiol had a 62nd minute goal ruled out for offside it looked like it might not be Croatia's night.Bu Manchester City's Gvardiol got the equaliser just a few minutes later and Croatia held on to take the second quarterfinal spot from Group A1.There was little to play for in Tenerife, where Spain, top of Group A4, took on the already relegated Switzerland.Coach Luis de la Fuente offered a first start to Barcelona midfielder Marc Casado and gave debuts to Samu and Aitor Paredes in a much-changed Spain side.But it was the two Bryans, Gil and Zaragoza, who got the goals that mattered for the European champions.Pedri's first half penalty was saved but Yeremi Pino converted to put Spain ahead.Joel Monteiro equalised for Switzerland after 63 minutes but Bryan Gil got Spain back in front five minutes later.

""We've come close on a couple of occasions and the next step is for me and the other boys to win.""We have a new coach coming in March.

Argentina 's 1-2 defeat to Paraguay in the FIFA World Cup qualifier on Friday was marred by an incident, where the World Cup-winning captain Lionel Messi faced the ire of Paraguay fans, as a water bottle was thrown at him from the stands while he was taking a corner.The match got heated at half-time when Messi confronted the referee over a decision related to a tackle by Paraguay defender Omar Alderete .Five minutes after getting a yellow card in the first half, Alderete brought Messi down to foil an attack; but the referee didn't pull up Alderete for a second yellow, much to the annoyance of Argentine players.The Paraguay fans, perhaps, reacted to Messi confronting the referee.However, Alderete apologized for the action of the fans and apologised to the legend in an Instagram post.""Dear Leo Messi, I want to apologize on behalf of my country for the unfortunate incident in which someone threw a bottle at you. You are an idol for millions here and around the world"", he wrote.""This deeply disrespectful act does not represent the affection and admiration we feel for you.""Talking about the game, Argentina took the lead early with a Lautaro Martinez strike in the 11th minute. However, the home team rallied in style as Antonio Sanabria's majestic bicycle kick made it 1-1.

HYDERABAD: India head coach Marquez Manolo has not notched up a win in three matches, and he admitted his team needs ""to improve in everything"" during the international friendly against familiar opponents Malaysia on Monday.Under Manolo, who was appointed head coach in July, India has so far lost once while drawing twice. India drew against Mauritius and lost 0-3 to Syria in the Intercontinental Cup in September. The team drew with Vietnam 1-1 in its last match on October 12.If the Indian team does not get a positive result on Monday, it will end the year without a win in 11 matches. Monday's match will also be India's last before the 2027 Asian Cup Qualifiers in March next year.""Obviously, we want to win after a long time. Football is about attack, defence, transitions and set pieces. We need to improve in everything,"" Manolo said on Sunday at the pre-match press conference.""For example, people say you played a great second half in Vietnam. I say 'yes', but we still made some big mistake that almost made us lose the game. We need to work on that. The team with less mistakes usually are the one who wins the game.""We will try to play a good game with fewer mistakes than Malaysia. We know the style of Malaysia, I know the coach perfectly (well). They play good football and it will be a tough game for both teams,"" said Manolo.The two sides have faced each other 32 times and there's nothing to separate the two sides in head-to-head results. The Blue Tigers and the Harimau Malaya have won 12 matches each, while eight have ended in draws.There is also little difference in the current FIFA rankings , with India placed 125th and Malaysia 133rd.""It's a friendly game but it will be good to check the level against a Pot 2 team (Malaysia) in the qualifiers. We have gone a long time without a win, so obviously we want to win. We want to show the improvement that we've been making in every training session,"" said Manolo.The draw for the Asian Cup Qualifiers will be held on December 9. India, ranked 125, will be placed in Pot 1, while Malaysia, ranked 133, will be in Pot 2. Irrespective of the result of the Monday's game, India will maintain their position in Pot 1.Manolo said senior player and central defender Sandesh Jhingan , who is returning to action after recovering from an injury he sustained 10 months ago, is the ""most difficult Indian player to be replaced"".""You don't have these kinds of players. Not that he is Messi but because he is very important in the team, in terms of the leadership, how he performs, the character he is.""Forward Edmund Lalrindika , who accompanied Manolo in the press conference, said, ""This is our third camp with coach Manolo. He is a really great coach. The preparations have been good. Everyone is comfortable with him. I enjoy training with him. We all know what he wants from us. We're looking forward to tomorrow.""The India-Malaysia football rivalry goes back a long way -- since their first meeting in a 1957 friendly in Kuala Lumpur, which India won 3-0, until last year's Merdeka tournament semifinal clash in which Malaysia emerged 4-2 winners.Like Manolo, Malaysia head coach Pau Martí also hails from Barcelona and took charge of Harimau Malaya in July. Under him, they won the Merdeka tournament in September and lost 0-4 to New Zealand last month.Malaysia beat Laos 3-1 in a friendly in Bangkok on November 14 and arrived in India from the Thai capital late on Saturday night.""I am very excited to play against Manolo. He is a great coach with a lot of experience. We are from the same city. He coached many clubs at different levels, from the fourth tier to LaLiga. For coaches from Barcelona, Manolo is an inspiration.""He has been in India for three or four years, working with different clubs. I'm sure the Indian team will be well prepared,"" said Martí.""I believe it's very tough to play here. We expect a very difficult game. For us as a team, we have to improve our record away from home. It's been difficult to win away. So I think it will be a good challenge and opportunity for us,"" the Malaysian coach added.",India plays Malaysia in an international friendly in Hyderabad on Monday.
