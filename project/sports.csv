NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan wicketkeeper-batter Kamran Akmal has labeled India's decision to open with Virat Kohli in the T20 World Cup as a significant mistake.In India's tournament opener against Ireland, Kohli, as an opener, was dismissed cheaply, scoring just 1 run off 5 balls. Despite this, the Indian team management appears set to continue with this batting order for their crucial match against Pakistan on Sunday.Akmal expressed his disagreement with this strategy, suggesting that Kohli should be positioned at No. 3, where he can anchor the innings and guide the team through the middle overs.""I don't think the batting order is correct. Virat Kohli can take the pressure at No.3 and finish the match. That is very important for Team India. Yashasvi Jaiswal should open the batting. Kohli should come at 3. If India stick to this batting order (of Kohli) opening, then they may get stuck at some point. Kohli holds one end up and finishes off the game. I think India are making a mistake by opening with Kohli,"" Akmal said on his YouTube channel.Kohli has extensive experience as an opener for his IPL franchise, Royal Challengers Bengaluru . In the recently concluded IPL, Kohli won the Orange Cap, scoring 741 runs at a strike rate of 154.India delivered a comprehensive performance in their first match of the tournament, but their real test lies ahead against Pakistan. The Pakistan team, reeling from a shock defeat to the USA, will be eager to bounce back.""India will be confident. Bumrah bowled well, Siraj did well. Hardik Pandya also got wickets. They have three matches at the same venue, that will also be an advantage,"" Akmal noted.Akmal also criticized the quality of the pitches in New York, calling on the ICC to ensure better playing surfaces for the marquee matches. ""ICC will have to produce better pitches for big matches. Otherwise, people will go away from this World Cup,"" he warned.As India prepare for the high-stakes clash against Pakistan, all eyes will be on their batting order and whether they stick with Kohli as an opener.","Former Pakistan wicketkeeper-batter Kamran Akmal has labeled India's decision to open with Virat Kohli as a significant mistake.

NEW DELHI: When asked if the IPL auction crosses his mind, Saurabh Netravalkar simply laughs on the other end of the phone before emphatically stating, ""No,"" in a resonant baritone.Netravalkar played a pivotal role in newcomers' USA's remarkable victory over former champions Pakistan in the T20 World Cup on Thursday.""It is just one match and we have done well.The focus should be on the next game and frankly speaking, all of us in the United States of America cricket team, are trying to come to terms with our achievements.""It is yet to sink in and things you are talking about, if it happens organically, it will happen. We are still trying to digest what happened,"" the former India U-19 left-arm pacer, who made the difference with a brilliant Super Over against Pakistan, told PTI in an exclusive interview on Friday.An alumnus of prestigious Cornell University and a senior software engineer at Oracle , Netravalkar adeptly balanced academics and cricket.""I have never felt the pressure. When you love something, it is never a job for you. So when I am out there on the field, I love bowling and trying to out-think a batter. When I am coding , I love doing that and hence it never feels like work,"" the left-arm seamer, who has suddenly become the talk of the town, couldn't have put it more lucidly.""Actually, we just flew down from Dallas to New York. I will be honest that it has been quite overwhelming. I wish I could personally thank each and everyone for their lovely messages. I feel blessed,"" one could sense the gratitude in his voice.What was the strategy for the Super Over, and when did he find out he would be bowling?""It wasn't pre-decided and only after the regulation 20 overs did skipper (Monank Patel) and coach (Stuart Law) informed me about it. I am thankful to them for showing faith in me.""He then gave an insight into the US strategy.""The plan was simple that I will try and bowl wide yorkers to the right handers and try to keep it out of his range as the boundary on that side was bigger. First ball the batter shifted and didn't get a wide and second ball, he stayed rooted and connected, and then, I got a couple of wides, as I was trying for wide lines.""But I must say that 18 runs helped and all those extra runs that Harmeet (Singh) and Aaron (Jones) ran, helped. Basically, if you are defending around 20, all you need is three good balls, and the job is done. It is one of the best matches I have played.""However, Netravalkar would matter-of-factly state that while opportunities in professional cricket are improving in the US, his primary source of income remains his day job at Oracle.""The best part is that I have got very supportive bosses at Oracle and I am allowed to work remotely when I am on tour, playing for the United States.""So on match days, I am excused from work but then there are scheduled project meetings which warrants my presence and then I work my practice schedule accordingly. I would also thank US Cricket board as they also are flexible if I have meetings lined up.""His is a fascinating story.""I can tell you that when I play local matches or club games in the United States, I have often logged in for a meeting at the lunch break and people have been very accommodating.""At Oracle, they all know by now I play cricket and everyone is happy to support. I work in team Oracle text and I am primarily a coder, who works on SQL and C (programming languages),"" he said.What are the prospects of a full-time cricket career in the United States?""Well, if you have a Major League Contracts, those are good and you can have a full-time cricket career.""Minor League Cricket is also seeing an upswing but another avenue is some weekend 'Pop-Up' tournaments, basically played from Friday to Sunday in Houston, Florida where you can actually earn well.""Come June 12, and Netravalkar will be facing the Indian team and he is quite emotional about it.""I know all of them and Surya (Yadav) and myself have played together for Mumbai U15s, U-17, U-19s. It is so good to see what he has achieved and it will be nice to catch up with them. Playing against India would be truly emotional.""",Saurabh Netravalkar played a pivotal role in USA's remarkable victory over former champions Pakistan in the T20 World Cup on Thursday.

India's T20 World Cup title chances are high: Travis Head

TimesofIndia.com

NEW DELHI: India are competing in another ICC tournament, the ICC T20 World Cup 2024, just six months after their last outing (ICC ODI World Cup 2023). Led by Rohit Sharma , Team India had a significant opportunity to claim an ICC title at home last year, a feat they have not achieved since 2013. However, they lost the title clash to Australia in Ahmedabad.India had progressed to the final after winning all their group matches and the semi-final but were defeated by six wickets in the final, with Australia securing their sixth ODI World Cup title.Now, India have entered the ICC T20 World Cup, being held in the USA and West Indies, once again as one of the favourites.India began their campaign on a winning note, defeating Ireland by eight wickets at the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium in New York.Their next assignment is a high-stakes match against arch-rivals Pakistan, taking place at the same venue where India won their opening match of the tournament.Can Rohit Sharma lead India to an ICC title win this time around?Former India spinner Harbhajan Singh believes that the Men in Blue need to play as a team and a 'we mentality' can propel them to a title victory.""Rohit is not alone; it's about 'we'. If we play as a united team, thinking about collective success rather than individual achievements, then we can win. But if we only focus on personal goals, things become difficult. It's all about the 'we' mentality, and that's when things come to life,"" Harbhajan, who is a cricket expert and commentator on Star Sports Press Room, toldThe 36-year-old Rohit Sharma is determined to secure an ICC trophy that has eluded India since their ICC Champions Trophy win in 2013.India's last T20 World Cup victory came in the inaugural edition in 2007, when Mahendra Singh Dhoni led the team to a five-run win over Pakistan in the final. This remains India's only title in the tournament's history.Since their 2007 triumph, India have reached the final only once in eight editions, finishing as runners-up in the 2014 tournament in Bangladesh after losing to Sri Lanka by six wickets.""Dhoni was a new captain and he needed that support from all of us. Before matches against teams like Australia, New Zealand, and England, our core group would get together during the game to strategise for the next few overs. For example, in a match against Australia, I bowled the crucial 17th or 18th overs because if we managed to give away only 4 runs, it saved us a lot,"" Harbhajan said.""Back then, batters didn't score 25 runs in an over unlike today. The decision-making was always a team effort. When you play together as a united team, you win more competitions. Dhoni was a great listener, taking collective decisions that benefited the team. It was never about individual performances but about playing as 'we',"" the former spinner told","India are competing in another ICC tournament, the ICC T20 World Cup 2024, just six months after their last outing (ICC ODI World Cup 2023) Led by Rohit Sharma, Team India had a significant opportunity to claim an ICC title at home last year, a feat they have not achieved since 2013.

SWEATING OVER DUBE'S FORM

WILL IT GO THE DISTANCE?

NEW YORK: When the ball jumped up from a length and hit captain Rohit Sharma 's thumb during a training session, there was suddenly a sense of apprehension that a beautiful day can turn stormy. But it only proved to be a strong gust - a regular feature along the Long Island coast - as the Indian captain started batting again, preparing for the storm ahead. After all, Pakistan lie in wait on Sunday.It's the match that cricket in this part of the world has been desperately waiting for. And just the way a lot is riding on it for the promotion of the sport itself in the United States, both teams' fates are hanging in the balance as well.For India, a defeat would mean a very difficult next few days in which they will have to ensure everything falls into place. That includes the weather, because a wash-out may also lead to an early ouster. As far as Pakistan are concerned, it's a point of no return after the shock loss to hosts US in Dallas the other day.The Pakistan team had a charity dinner planned for which tables had already been booked in New York, but that was scrapped following the backlash of defeat at home. The team is in a terrible space, with nothing going right for them. India are probably the last team they would like to play in a situation like this.Add to that the familiarity factor that they are sorely lacking for New York conditions. The new pitches here have undulations, making the ball skid. There's excessive movement of the white ball due to the early starts. India have been here for the last two weeks, battling their way to familiarity, but for Pakistan, it's truly virgin territory. They landed on Thursday night, took Friday off, and had a rigorous session on Saturday, hoping that they could make a game of it.It's not the best-case scenario when the toss becomes so important in the final outcome of the game. But that's what it is at the Nassau International County Ground for now, where batting is extremely difficult in the first few overs.India have a fine batting lineup that has prepared hard for difficult circumstances like these, but the Pakistan pace quartet of Shaheen Afridi , Mohammed Amir, Haris Rauf and Naseem Shah may just become deadly if they can get to make first use of the wicket.As for India, Jasprit Bumrah is deadly on any surface, and if he bowls four overs full steam on this pitch in the morning session, the game could be over then and there.On a track like this, having more meat in the batting department is important and Shivam Dube's batting form hasn't been up to scratch. While he struggled in the practice game against Bangladesh, the southpaw didn't get time to get into the groove against Ireland in the opener.The team management spent a lot of time on his batting in the two days of practice ahead of the game.While he got a shortish stint on Friday, the Saturday practice was all about Dube. He was the only player among the 15 who turned up and worked on his technique against the short ball, batting coach Vikram Rathour giving him some serious batting tips.There is a ready-made replacement available in Yashasvi Jaiswal and he, too, got an intense batting practice session on Friday.Amid all these, for the fans coming in from near and far including the new ones who are looking to get a first feel of cricket, the hope will be to experience ‘a contest'. Both the flags will flutter in the morning breeze as neighbours, who have turned many a foreign field into great cricket venues with their intense rivalry, will look to conquer new shores.",India take on Pakistan in their first Test in New York on Sunday. Both teams' fates are hanging in the balance as well. A defeat would mean a very difficult next few days for India. A wash-out may also lead to an early ouster for Pakistan.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110829843,imgsize-131074,width-400,resizemode-4/110829843.jpg"

Things in India and Pakistan come to a standstill when it is about a game of cricket between the two estranged neighbours, and the Group A match at the T20 World Cup in New York on Sunday is no different.Besides pride and progress in the tournament at stake, an India vs Pakistan encounter is a lot about fans' emotions that go through the roof. Among crores of them are also celebrities from all walks of life on both sides of the border.Pakistan singer-actor Ali Zafar is one of them, and he chose to share his sentiments on social media with a video, talking not just about the India vs Pakistan match but also what went wrong in Pakistan's defeat against USA and how Babar Azam is failing to lead from the front.""I don't believe in criticism or criticism for the sake of criticism. I think it should be constructive...because we love our team, our nation,"" said Zafar in a video he posted on the microblogging platform 'X'.Pakistan suffered a shock 'Super Over' defeat in their opening match of the tournament against co-hosts USA, and Zafar was upset about the fact that Babar Azam chose to not put himself in the line of fire by coming out to bat in the 'Super Over'.""Looking at a captain, we want to be inspired,"" he said. ""If you are listening, Babar, a leader or captain is a leader because he leads from the front....a leader's speciality is that a leader is fearless and has no self-doubt. That is why he is a leader.""Zafar went on to mention Pakistan's ODI against Australia from the past where the Aussies needed four runs to win in the final over and captain Imran Khan came on to bowl himself and won the match for his team.""So what we expect from you, Babar, is that you go into the field with that same belief and confidence. Winning and losing is part of the game, but face it and play with fear because you are an amazing player,"" said Zafar, a leading personality from the entertainment industry in Pakistan.Of late, Pakistan management and the country's cricket board have been criticized on the aspect of players' fitness, with the heavyset Azam Khan central to that argument.Zafar concurred that it's difficult for a player or team to perform if they don't meet the fitness standards.""There are global standards for fitness, you can't survive without that. I won't take the name of the player but I think we should really focus on (fitness)...And it's not just physical fitness. The body follows the mind. So mental fitness is (also) very important. The decisions that you take in mind get manifested in your physical reality,"" he said.He also advised Pakistan cricketers to not be shy of speaking in their own language, Urdu.""We should be proud of our culture and language. It's not that you are considered 'cool' only if you talk in English. Talk freely in your own language. A translator can come and translate. Many players around the world talk in their own language with pride,"" he opined.Zafar concluded the video by wishing his team for the match against India.""Best wishes...khel lena bas (just play).""While Pakistan suffered a shock defeat against the US in their first match, India hammered Ireland by eight wickets.

NEW YORK: This is getting slightly repetitive, but the pitch talk just doesn't go away. The ICC had said that they would try to do something about the pitch for the India-Pakistan game, but the first innings of the South Africa-Netherlands game didn't give anybody any sense of confidence.Netherlands managed 103 and when Rohit was meeting the press ahead of the Pakistan game, South Africa had been reduced to 3-3.It's the same pitch that is likely to be used for the Sunday bash and the Pakistani contingent, who only had one practice session in New York before the game, is obviously worried.When a Pakistan journalist asked India captain Rohit Sharma how much of an advantage India would have going into this game, the India captain gave a cheeky reply: ""This is not our home either, yes we have played a couple of games here, but a few of our training sessions have been washed out too…and about the pitch, well even the curator doesn't know how the pitch will behave.""The teams from the subcontinent are not used to the idea of drop-in pitches and the skipper said the curator, who is an Aussie, is still trying to figure out ""how much grass to take out"".""I think both the teams will have similar opportunities and whoever plays better will win,"" Rohit added.The Pakistan team's loss in the first game to United States also came up for discussion, but the captain doesn't feel that it will make them a less dangerous opposition.""This is a format where anything can happen anywhere. In the last T20 World Cup , they lost to Zimbabwe and then went on to play the final. Here, you cannot think much about the opposition, because form doesn't take too long to come and go,"" Rohit said.The Indian skipper has been hurt a few times during this World Cup, once during the game against Ireland and once in practice on Friday. But the captain insisted that those who want to play for India, have to deal with such blows. ""It's tough, but as far as I am concerned, blows don't count for anything. You have to cross those hurdles,"" Rohit said.The skipper evoked memories of Gabba while trying to elaborate on the point: ""If you remember the Gabba Test (in January 2020), we won it because of mental toughness. These are the moments where you test yourself, all players who want to make a name for himself have to thrive in these moments,"" the skipper said.","The ICC had said that they would try to do something about the pitch for the India-Pakistan game, but the first innings of the South Africa-Netherlands game didn't give anybody any sense of confidence.

It was 13 years ago that he lifted the World Cup with India and now he has to do the job of guiding Pakistan in a T20 World Cup in which things have started to go downhill.Asked whether things look any different on the other side of the border, Kirsten smiled.“I have been in charge for 13 days, but the frenzy seems the same from both sides. It's great to be associated with both these teams,” Kirsten, who was the Gujarat Titans batting coach in the IPL, said.Could his knowledge of Indian players be an advantage for Pakistan?

Mid-off is inside the circle, and yet he bowls full and gets hit for a boundary on the last ball. You can see the captain also screamed at him.

NEW DELHI: After a respectable first-class career, some were looking for greener pastures; others were hoping for a second chance at life; and still others were just talented enough to be forced to find an obscure cricket ground on a weekend.Meet the stars of the USA's T20 World Cup debut, which shocked the cricket world by defeating Pakistan, the finalists of the previous edition, in Dallas:The team's captain, who was born in Ahmedabad, is one of the few individuals who moved to essentially pursue his cricketing career. He was awarded player of the match for his half century. In 2010, he obtained a Green Card, and in 2016, he moved permanently to New Jersey.A powerful right-hander, when he's not playing for his country, he also teaches cricket to kids living abroad three times a week and runs coaching clinics. Turf wickets were scarce in the USA at first, and Monank has participated in numerous 20- and 30-over weekend club events throughout the nation in addition to playing a lot of matting cricket.Netravalkar is the epitome of a happy union between academia and athletics. He rose to prominence following a brilliant Super Over, and before that he squared up Mohammed Rizwan with an away swinger and tricked Iftikhar Ahmed with a low sinking slow full-toss.During the 2010 World Cup in New Zealand, he faced some of the best U-19 English cricket players, including Joe Root, Jos Buttler, and Ben Stokes. Known as ""Netra"" at the time, he combined well with fellow left-arm seamer Jaydev Unadkat and Sandeep Sharma of Punjab.But just like in Mumbai, one must be the best in order to live; being good is insufficient. The academically gifted young man, who already had an engineering degree in computer science, was awarded a scholarship to study for an MS at Cornell University.But sport never left him. To establish himself, he competed at all levels of US cricket and put on a respectable performance in Major League sport's inaugural season, which featured several of the best T20 players in the world.He works as a senior technologist at Oracle's Silicon Valley division, away from cricket.As with many young talents, he lost his way, but Ian Chappell wanted him to be inducted into the Indian team after his performances in the 2012 U-19 World Cup. When he was caught by the police driving inside a train station, rumors about his lack of discipline spread quickly, and Mumbai cricket turned its back on him.As a professional, he relocated to Tripura, but he had little luck there. He made the wise decision to immigrate to the United States. Including a recent series against Bangladesh, he has been among the most reliable players since finding his groove again. With the ball in Rizwan's hands, he swiped extra runs during the Super Over.Not sure if Kenjige has heard the well-known country song ""I come from Alabama"" by Stephen C. Foster, the father of American music, but being born in that well-known Southeast, Kenjige's story as a Tamil-American is intriguing.He used to be a left-arm medium pacer before learning to spin at the age of thirteen. He had moved to Ooty with his parents when he was a young child. Kenjige's parents sent him to Bengaluru when he was eighteen years old, where he participated in the KSCA's first division league.But after realizing how difficult it was to even get into the Karnataka state side, he made the decision to return home and enrol in a bio-medical engineering program.When he went for the United States, he had given up playing cricket and had not even bothered to pack his equipment. However, a cricket ball that his mother had hidden in his suitcase changed everything. After landing a position in Washington, DC, he played squash in the evenings and learned about club cricket in New York.After that, he quit his position as a Bio-Medical officer and joined the USA's WCL Division 4 team.When Milind Kumar first arrived, everyone in the Delhi circuit scene thought he was a good talent. However, after seven years, he was reduced to a supporting role and frequently left to bat with the tail in Ranji Trophy matches. Moving to Sikkim in the Plate League and scoring over 1300 runs did not prove to be the lucky break he had hoped for.He moved to the US after COVID-19 and performed well in local competitions to secure a spot in the 15. He was an excellent fielder, even for Delhi, and Iftikhar Ahmed would have learned his lesson the hard way in the Super Over. Pakistan's aspirations were dashed by the catch, leaping forward after racing ten yards from the long-off boundary.Whether you live in India or the US, now is a great time to be a Nitish Kumar. School-going Nitish set a world record in 2011 when MS Dhoni struck that massive six-ball to win the World Cup and Virat Kohli was just starting to make waves as the next big thing. At 16 years old, Nitish played a 50-over World Cup match for Canada against Zimbabwe, becoming the youngest player to do so.His moment of glory came thirteen years ago when he hit the boundary off Haris Rauf's final delivery. As Ian Bishop would have said: ""Remember the Name, Nitish Kumar.""Jessy, who was born in New Jersey, raised in a rural Punjabi household, and is currently in his teens, has spent a considerable amount of time in the land of opportunity.He was left out of the US squad that traveled to the West Indies to compete in a domestic 50 over competition in 2015. In order to double his practice hours, Jessy left everything.Former US coach Pubudu Dassanayeke organized five first-class matches in Sri Lanka in 2016, which is where he discovered the value of perseverance. He has become an essential member of Pakistani Ali Khan's speed attack over the last few years. Without a doubt, the delivery that struck Babar Azam out was the best of his career thus far.","The stars of the USA's T20 World Cup debut, which shocked the cricket world by defeating Pakistan, the finalists of the previous edition, in Dallas.

NEW DELHI: Australian spinner Adam Zampa played a pivotal role in his team's commanding 36-run victory over England in their T20 World Cup clash at Kensington Oval.Despite missing a potential ""catch of the tournament"", Zampa's impactful bowling performance proved instrumental in securing Australia's win.ALSO SEE: T20 World Cup Schedule Chasing a challenging target, England got off to a blistering start, with captain Jos Buttler and opener Phil Salt taking the attack to the Australian bowlers.The duo amassed 73 runs in the first seven overs, putting immense pressure on the defending champions.Zampa's introduction into the attack proved to be the turning point of the match.

""I looked at the scoreboard and went, alright, it's time to stand up. So, I absolutely love those situations. We play a lot of cricket where you don't feel like that.

As the finalists of the previous edition, Pakistan will be looking to bounce back from their opening setback and make a strong statement against India in this crucial match.""It's a big game India (versus) Pakistan, there's no need for me to motivate the team anymore. They are well-motivated, they are focused for this game,"" Kirsten told the media on the eve of the match.""We have to forget about the last couple of days and just move forward, that's the only way you can deal with life. Results are results (and they) take care of themselves,"" Pakistan's limited-overs coach added.India have been stationed in New York, participating in two matches, including a warmup game against Bangladesh. On the other hand, Pakistan will be making their debut in this tournament, as they have not played any games thus far in the city.Kirsten refused to see it as an advantage to India. ""We were going to go out there and make sure we do the best that we can with our skill sets and how we can put pressure on the opposition,"" he said.""I'm not sure because I can't predict what's going to happen. I don't know whether it'll be an advantage,"" he added.Kirsten, the former coach of the Indian team during the 2011 World Cup, where India and Pakistan faced off in the semifinal at Mohali, expressed that the upcoming encounter on Sunday has a unique atmosphere surrounding it. The significance of this match differs from their previous World Cup meeting, according to Kirsten, who guided India to victory in that tournament.""I think it is a little bit different because it's not in India or Pakistan,"" he said.However, the South African coach acknowledged that he couldn't provide any additional insights since he has observed the Indian players closely during his tenure as a mentor for the Gujarat Titans in the IPL.""These players have seen enough of each other and how they play.

NEW DELHI: Indian skipper Rohit Sharma has affirmed that Rishabh Pant , the dynamic wicketkeeper-batsman, will remain a constant presence in the upper order during the ICC T20 World Cup .This strategic decision aims to disrupt the predominantly right-handed top four and capitalize on Pant's aggressive approach against spin bowlers, which Rohit believes will prove crucial as the tournament advances and shifts to the West Indies.The Nassau County International Stadium is set to witness a thrilling encounter on Sunday, as the long-standing rivals, India and Pakistan, face off in their eagerly awaited ICC T20 World Cup clash. This 'Super Sunday' promises to showcase an array of cricketing talent from both sides.India enter the match with a strong sense of self-assurance, having recently secured an impressive eight-wicket victory against Ireland. Conversely, Pakistan will be determined to bounce back from their unexpected loss to tournament co-hosts and debutants, the United States of America. The stakes are high as Pakistan seeks to overcome their setback by triumphing over their most formidable adversary in the cricketing world.Speaking about Pant's role in the team, Rohit said during the pre-match press conference, ""I had to see Pant in a few IPL games to decide where I wanted to play him during the World Cup. When I saw him during the first half of the tournament, I was really happy with his performance. With a player like him, and the ability he has, it is tough to find the right number for him. But when we have three right-handers in the start, it is nice to have him in the middle. When we move ahead in the tournament, spinners will play a big role and his counterattacking ability against spin will be important.""""With Yashasvi Jaiswal not in the playing eleven, he is that guy who can play with freedom. I have seen enough of him doing that over the years and I know what his strengths. There is a bit of weakness as well, but I want to focus on his strengths. I think he has got an all-round game, which I would like to utilise more and get him to play more balls. Besides the openers, none of the guys' positions are fixed. We want to be flexible about these positions. Some guys love certain entry points into the game and we would like to think about it,"" he added.Pant, who recently made a comeback to competitive cricket as the captain of Delhi Capitals in IPL 2024 following a severe car accident in December 2022, has been batting at number three in the warm-up match against Bangladesh and the first Group A encounter against Ireland. He scored 53 and 36* respectively in those games.Regarding the pitch at Nassau County Stadium, which has been under intense scrutiny for its inconsistent bounce and unpredictable behavior, Rohit emphasized that playing good cricket will be crucial regardless of the opposition or the pitch conditions.""You know what to expect, you have to prepare accordingly. We have spoken about it, what to do, what could be the game plan for batters and bowlers, control what we can control, which is to give your best, assess and play accordingly. There is a lot of experience in our changing room. I expect everyone to make decisions. It can go either side, but as long as you make decisions based on what you have seen in front of you, you give yourself the best chance to win. Nothing changes for us, we will try ticking all the boxes,"" he added.Regarding the contribution of their star player Virat Kohli , Rohit expressed his perspective. While acknowledging the presence of crucial players within the squad, Rohit emphasized his desire for a collective effort from all team members. He stressed the importance of everyone stepping up and making valuable contributions, rather than depending solely on the performance of one or two individuals.""Virat did not play the game against Bangladesh, did not have a first great game, but he has enough experience and training under his belt to do well, which cannot be beaten. He has played all over the world,"" added the skipper.Virat has a fine record against Pakistan in T20 WC- 308 runs in five matches at an average of 308.00 and a strike rate of 132.75, with four half-centuries and best score of 82*.On him and Rishabh sustaining some blows to their body during the Ireland clash and in the nets due to the pitch's invariable bounce, Rohit said, ""The reason why they (Indian players) are playing is because they are all mentally tough and more skilled than anyone else. When you play at the highest level, these blows do not count. In many places like South Africa, and Australia, you have to cross such hurdles. We won the test in Gabba (back in 2021) because we were mentally tough, Guys got hit in the chest, hands etc due to invariable bounce. It is not going to be easy all the time. These are the moments when you try and test yourself. I am sure all the players playing want to be in difficult conditions and thrive in them.

KOLKATA: With his hands on the hip, Sunil Chhetri stood a little distance away from the pack of his teammates in the middle of the park. He stood motionless, as if dazed, for a few seconds, his eyes blank and without expression.

A few minutes ago, Chinese referee Fu Ming had blown the whistle to seal India's goalless draw with Kuwait in their second-round fixture of the 2026 World Cup qualifiers, thus ringing the curtain on Chhetri's 19-year-old career in the Blue Tigers jersey.

Suddenly the Salt Lake Stadium stands roared into ""Chhetri, Chhteri"" chants, stirring the 39-year-old out of his trance as he was given a standing ovation He began a lap of honour around the ground. Then he broke down in tears as his teammates, coach Igor Stimac and his coaching staff members lined up to give him the guard of honour. After plethora of hugs and handshakes, he slowly walked down the tunnel, out of everyone's sight and into a new life, leaving behind a legacy Indian football has hardly experienced.

The build-up to Thursday's match was all about Chhetri's send-off. Before the kick-off, the famed Blue Pilgrims stand behind the goalpost unfurled a giant tifo, showing Chhetri holding the earth, a la Hercules. India failed to turn the occasion more memorable and meaningful for Chhetri following the stalemate but that tifo perhaps represents what Chhetri has stood for in Indian football in nearly two decades since making his senior de but against Pakistan in 2005.

He will be remembered as the defining player of his generation, someone who has transcended his sport more than any other, a reference point in Indian football in the true sense of the term.

Unlike IM Vijayan, he might not have an eye for the spectacular. Unlike Bhaichung Bhutia, he might not be a typical fox in the box. Chhetri's game has always been a fable of discipline, dedication and determination.

His goals were cheeky, audacious and brilliant - scoring from midfield to embarrassing the goalkeeper with a Panenka penalty. He made people fall in love with the game.

In a later post-match felicitation, organized by the Indian Football Association, he returned to the ground to receive accolades from the Big 3 clubs - East Bengal , Mohun Bagan and Mohammedan Sporting as well as the state government. A few former players like Vijayan, Mehtab Hossain, Alvito D'Cunha and Rahim Nabi then gave him a tight embrace one by one.

","Chhetri will be remembered as the defining player of his generation. Chhetri's game has always been a fable of discipline, dedication and determination. The 39-year-old broke down in tears as his teammates, coach Igor Stimac and his coaching staff lined up to give him the guard of honour.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110783171,imgsize-40258,width-400,resizemode-4/110783171.jpg"

Sunil Chhetri

as India fluff their lines in must-win tie against Kuwait

KOLKATA: Goodbye Sunil Chhetri. But not a welcome yet for India to a dream place in the third round of the 2026 Fifa World Cup qualifiers .India failed to give their captain a perfect farewell as Igor Stimac 's team was held to a frustrating 0-0 draw against Kuwait at the Salt Lake Stadium on Thursday. As the tearful Chhetri left the international football stage after 151 caps and 94 goals and failing to make an impact in Thursday's game, India's chances of qualifying to the next round now hang in balance.With 5 points from as many matches, and both Afghanistan (4 points from 4 games) and Kuwait (4 points from 5 games) lurking close by, the Blue Tigers now have to beat the already qualified Qatar in their own den in the final Group A fixture next Tuesday to keep hopes alive.A top-two finish in the group is the prerequisite not only for opening the door for brushing shoulders with Asia's best in the third round of World Cup qualifiers, but also guaranteeing a berth in the next edition of Asian Cup .With stakes so high, it felt like a juncture match for Igor Stimac's side. Chhetri's farewell - which drew an official attendance of 58,921 in the stands - further elevated the sense of the occasion.But India never looked in sync with the challenge in question, dishing out another frustrating performance nearly three months after losing 1-2 to Afghanistan in Guwahati and making their job more difficult now.In fact, had Gurpreet Singh Sandhu not effected a string of saves, it could have been quite embarrassing for Chhetri and his team.Stimac started with a new and bold defensive set-up, giving FC Goa left-back Jay Gupta his debut in Blue Tigers jersey and pairing up Rahul Bheke with Anwar Ali in the heart of defence in absence of injured Sandesh Jhingan.But if the Croatian coach's 4-2-3-1 formation was meant to gain early ascendancy, it failed to instil the sort of organisation and obduracy that he would have expected to characterise his backline. The result was a streak of nervy moments invading the home team's play.The match was just four minutes old when Bheke failed to intercept a pass, allowing Mohammad Abdulah to stare at the goal with a world of time and space. But Kuwait's No. 9 ended up hitting straight at Gurpreet.Relieved and reprieved, India tried to make a statement, Liston Colaco seeing his cutback cleared by Kuwait defender Hasan Alanezi for a corner and Chhetri skying an attempt way over the bar.Just when India appeared to have started to establish a more recognisable rhythm, Kuwait shook the hosts out of a false dawn, threatening to upset the applecart.",India fail to give their captain a perfect farewell as Igor Stimac's team was held to a frustrating 0-0 draw against Kuwait at the Salt Lake Stadium on Thursday.

NEW DELHI: India's 2026 FIFA World Cup Qualifier against Kuwait ended in a disappointing goalless draw, failing to provide a fitting farewell for the talismanic Sunil Chhetri in his last international match.The result leaves India in a challenging position to progress to the third round of the qualifiers, with only five points collected so far. India's final match is against Asian champions Qatar on June 11, while Kuwait, with four points, will face Afghanistan on the same day.Chhetri's international career spans an impressive 19 years, during which he scored 94 goals, making him the fourth most prolific scorer in international football, behind Portugal superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (128), Iran legend Ali Daei (108) and Argentine wizard Lionel Messi (106).This remarkable achievement is particularly noteworthy for a player from a country like India, and FIFA recognised Chhetri's legendary status upon his announcement of international retirement on May 16.Kolkata's Salt Lake Stadium, with a capacity of 68,000, was packed with fans, officials, and former players who came to bid an emotional adieu to Chhetri.His parents, Kharga and Sushila, and wife, Sonam Bhattacharya, were also in attendance. Although Chhetri's international career has come to an end, he will continue playing club football for Bengaluru FC in the Indian Super League for another two years, as per his current contract.Chhetri's debut match against Pakistan on June 12, 2005, in Quetta ended in a 1-1 draw, with the striker scoring in his first international appearance.However, he was unable to find the back of the net in his final match, which also ended in a draw, and had little impact on the game overall.Chhetri, the Indian captain, bid farewell to the national team after his 151st match, taking a lap of honour around the packed stadium with folded hands as the crowd chanted his name.Kuwait, who had previously suffered a 0-1 defeat to India at home, showed significant improvement in their performance. The first half was action-packed, with both teams creating chances but failing to find the back of the net.The crowd remained engaged, chanting ""Sunil, Sunil"" and ""Vande Mataram"" throughout the match.Kuwait's best chance in the first half came in the fourth minute when Eid Al-Rashidi set up Daham with a perfect through ball. However, Indian goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu made a crucial save to deny Mohammad Daham.India responded in the 11th minute with Liston Colaco's low cross, but Hasan Alanezi's sliding clearance prevented Chhetri from scoring his 95th goal.Debutant Jay Gupta was involved in the action, delivering a sublime low cross from the left in the 25th minute, but the Kuwait defense cleared it for a corner. India failed to capitalize on a freekick in the 28th minute, despite Poojary's impressive run and nutmeg.At the halfway mark, Thapa sent a fantastic ball into the box, which Kuwait cleared to deny Sahal Abdul Samad. The rebound fell to Liston Colaco, who fired a low strike into the side netting from a narrow angle.In the second half, Igor Stimac made changes to India's attacking lineup, introducing Rahim Ali, Brandon Fernandes, and Chheri. However, the desired result was not achieved, as Rahim failed to convert his chances.Kuwait's frustration peaked in the 74th minute when they were denied a penalty claim, leading to a confrontation between players and bench.Replays suggested a foul, but the referee deemed otherwise. Tempers flared up after a challenge on Indian debutant Edmund, resulting in a mini-brawl and yellow cards for both Edmund and Sultan Alenezi.Despite the tension, Edmund rallied the crowd's support with a free-kick opportunity, but Brandon Fernandes' poor delivery meant India's last hope for a win disappeared in the added seven minutes.Stimac handed left-back Gupta his international debut in a 4-2-3-1 formation, with Chhetri as the sole striker.

NEW DELHI: El Salvador's Marcelo Arevalo and his Croatian partner Mate Pavic triumphed in a tense final, edging out the Italian pair Simone Bolelli and Andrea Vavassori 7-5, 6-3 to win the French Open men's doubles title on Saturday.

This victory marked the first Grand Slam win for Arevalo and Pavic as a pair. Arevalo, 33, previously won the French Open men's doubles title in 2022 with Dutchman Jean-Julien Rojer. Meanwhile, the 30-year-old Pavic has now secured men's doubles titles in all four Grand Slam tournaments.

""It feels special,"" said Pavic, who has won seven Grand Slams, including three mixed doubles titles. ""I want to thank Marcelo for bringing me to the top. He knows how it is to be done.""

""Two crazy weeks, a lot of tough matches... we did it together man. I'm really happy,"" Arevalo replied.

Bolelli and Vavassori, who had reached the Australian Open final in January, broke early in the second set to go 2-1 up. But Arevalo and Pavic immediately broke back and then broke again to take a decisive 5-3 lead, ultimately winning the second set and the match.

He’ll have a chance to do that on Sunday.Carlitos or ‘Little Carlos’ would run home after school this time of the year to turn on the television and watch the French Open . The clay court championship is one of Alcaraz’ earliest memories of tennis .“I have watched a lot of matches. Rafa Nadal dominating this tournament for 14-15 years. It's unbelievable,” he said. “I wanted to put my name on that list of Spanish players who have won this tournament. Not only Rafa, but also Juan Carlos Ferrero, Carlos Moya, Alberto Costa… I want to put my name on that list, as well.”Alcaraz, who on Friday became the youngest player to reach Grand Slam finals on all three surfaces -- grass, hard court, and clay – was tooled to excel on all surfaces.Not that the 21-year-old is checking records at this point, more likely that he’s walking around the Eiffel Tower, looking at the iconic five-ring logo of the Olympic Games which was unveiled on Friday.“That is something that I don't want to think about before the final,” he said. “But obviously that means I'm playing good tennis on every surface.”“If I want to be one of the best players in the world, I have to be a good player on every surface, like -- Roger (Federer), Novak (Djokovic), Rafa, Nadal and Andy Murray. The best players in the world have had success on every surface.”The Spaniard might’ve grown up playing on clay, but he enjoys playing on hardcourts the most.“I consider myself the kind of player who can adapt very well his style in every surface. I grew up playing on clay, but I feel more comfortable playing on hard court. I just wanted to be a good player in every surface.”On Sunday, in his third major final, Alcaraz will look to stop the fourth-seeded Alexander Zverev .The 27-year-old German made his first major final in 2020 in New York, four years later, he’s in with a second chance.Zverev leads the head-to-head 5-4, but the Spaniard finished on top in their last meeting in Indian Wells. At the Australian Open in January, Zverev came through in four sets.“Sascha is playing great tennis on clay. Big serve, big shots, really solid,” Alcaraz said. “It's going to be a really interesting final. So I'll try to take the good things that I did in the previous matches and try to improve the bad things that I did against him.”.Zverev, at 27, very much the senior pro in the mix, is ready to swing. “If not now then when?” he asked.“We have had very tough battles in the past,” the German said. “It is going to be a difficult match. It is a Grand Slam final, if you're in a Grand Slam final, you deserve to be there. That goes for both of us.","Carlos Alcaraz will play Alexander Zverev in the French Open final on Sunday.

On a perfect spring evening in Paris, when the sun was sharp and the wind chilly, the world No.1 went down on Court Philippe Chatrier to celebrate, the dirt stuck on her knees. It was a squeaky-clean performance otherwise.Swiatek, who later bounced around the court, which must now seem like her backyard, climbed up to her box, reaching for her family and team. As the players waited for the presentation ceremony, the Pole held up four fingers, and recorded the moment on her phone. The four-time French Open champion was misty-eyed.On the other side of the court, Jasmine Paolini was steady in her seat. The Italian, who had never been past the second round here until this year, was putting the 6-2, 6-1 result in perspective.Paolini, aged 28 and ranked 15, is a 5 ft 4’ bundle of joy. She might not have had the weapons to trouble Swiatek, whose game is geared for clay, but the Italian has enjoyed an inspirational run here, showing what hard work and effort could do.“Congratulations Jasmine for an amazing tournament. I’m really impressed with how you’ve been playing, I think you can do so much, especially on clay...” said Swiatek, who has now won 21 straight matches at Roland-Garros, was richer by €2,400,000 on Saturday.“I want to thank my team, my family, without them I wouldn’t be here,” Swiatek said. “I love this place, I wait every year to come back here. I was almost out of the tournament in the second round (against Naoimi Osaka) so thank you for cheering me. This has been a really emotional tournament.”Paolini, who will play the doubles final on Saturday, said, “Congratulations Iga, I think to play you here is the toughest challenge in this sport. I want to thank my team, my family and everyone for believing in me. These have been the best days of my life. It has been a very intense 15 days. Today was tough, but I’m really proud of myself. Merci Boku, Paris.”Paolini, who took home €1,200,000, will make her Top-10 debut on Monday at No.7.On another surface, one that’s faster perhaps and slicker perhaps, the player field has a chance against Swiatek, but on the slow shale of Roland Garros, the 23-year-old won’t allow even a window of opportunity. She uses her topspin to flatten the challenge of her opponents. Not only can the Pole outstay, she can also outhit and outrun. A potent cocktail to go up against.The head-to-head record of the finalists best reflected the rise and rise of Swiatek.The 23-year won the only previous WTA main draw meeting against Paolini at the 2022 US Open first round.

NEW DELHI: World no.1 Iga Swiatek on Saturday defeated Italy's Jasmine Paolini in straight sets in the women's singles final to clinch her third consecutive French Open title in Paris.Top-seeded Swiatek beat Paolini 6-2, 6-1 at Court Philippe Chatrier in just 68 minutes to grab her fourth Roland Garros title.With the lop-sided win Polish Swiatek also claimed her fifth Grand Slam title.Swiatek, 23, has now won all five Grand Slam finals she has contested. Her other victory came at the 2022 US Open.Swiatek carried a 20-match French Open winning streak into the final against the 12th-seeded Paolini.Paolini was participating in a Major final for the first time at age 28.The Italian had never been past the second round at one of the four most important tennis tournaments until the Australian Open in January.Swiatek came out all guns blazing early in the contest but after narrowly missing the chance to break from 0-40 down in the second game, the top-seeded Pole made heavy weather of the next to surrender her serve, before bouncing right back.The diminutive Paolini, only the third Italian woman after Francesca Schiavone and Sara Errani to reach the Roland Garros final since the sport turned professional in 1968, went toe to toe with Swiatek from there but cracked in the sixth game.With the momentum shifting, claycourt specialist Swiatek began to dominate the exchanges from the baseline, superbly working the angles and sealing the opening set in 37 minutes after winning 20 out of 24 points since going down a break.A shell-shocked Paolini smiled and soaked up the support and applause from the crowd on the main showcourt when she won the odd point early in the next set, but her challenge faded in the afternoon sun as Swiatek broke twice to build a 4-0 lead.Swiatek, who dropped only one set throughout the tournament in a second-round epic with Naomi Osaka, won 10 successive games before Paolini got on the scoreboard, but there was to be no late comeback drama and the knockout blow was not long in coming.Swiatek closed out the victory when Paolini sent a shot long and rejoiced by dropping to her knees and pumping her fists, letting out a huge roar, before joining her entourage in the stands for another round of celebrations.","Top-seeded Swiatek beat Paolini 6-2, 6-1 at Court Philippe Chatrier in just 68 minutes to grab her fourth Roland Garros title. Polish world no.1 has now won all five Grand Slam finals she has contested.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110824381,imgsize-54454,width-400,resizemode-4/110824381.jpg"
