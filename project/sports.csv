NEW DELHI: RJD leader Rohini Acharya’s announcement that she is quitting politics, along with emotional allegations of humiliation and abuse by her own family, drew sympathy from Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) chief Chirag Paswan, who referenced his own experiences with personal crises while responding to the matter.On Saturday, Rohini declared that she was separating from both her family and the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD). A day later, she escalated her allegations, accusing her brother Tejashwi Yadav of humiliating and abusing her, claiming that the situation deteriorated to the point where “a slipper was raised to hit her.”In a post on X, she wrote, ""Yesterday, a daughter, a sister, a married woman, a mother was humiliated, abuses were hurled, shoes were raised to kill her... I didn't compromise on my self-respect, didn't give up on truth... just because of this, I had to face insults. Yesterday, a daughter left her crying parents and siblings due to helplessness... she was forced to leave her parental home... she was made an orphan... I pray that none of you ever have to walk my path, and no house should have a daughter-sister like Rohini. ""Speaking to reporters Sunday, Chirag Paswan said, ""I will not make any comments on this because I can understand the mental status when a family goes through such a difficult situation.I have also been through this.”Paswan added that political differences have never affected his personal warmth toward Lalu Prasad Yadav’s children.""We might have had political differences but I have always considered Lalu ji's family my own. Be it Tejashwi, Tej, Misa or Rohini, I have considered them my siblings,"" he said, as quoted by ANI.""I pray that this family dispute is resolved at the earliest. If there is unity in the family, a person can fight tough situations outside. The family must be going through a tough situation,"" he added.Rohini’s public fallout comes on the heels of the RJD’s dramatic electoral collapse, with the Tejashwi-led party winning just 25 of 143 seats- a loss of more than 100 seats.Her brother Tej Pratap Yadav, who himself was expelled from both the Yadav family and the RJD a few months earlier, also reacted to the developments, warning those he called “traitors” and issuing an emotional appeal to his father, Lalu Prasad Yadav.",Rohini Acharya announced that she is leaving the Rashtriya Janata Dal. She accused her brother Tejashwi Yadav of humiliating and abusing her. Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) chief Chirag Paswan said he has been through personal crises.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125374442,imgsize-1151675,width-400,resizemode-4/pic-23.jpg"

The caretaker of the house Subhash alias Surendra reportedly told the cops he had been sexually abusing and strangulating his victims before disposing of their bodies in the drain.

The Culmination

The painful truths

Investigative systems can fail, especially when constrained by corruption, negligence, or lack of urgency.

Evidence matters, but how it's collected — and whether due process is followed — can make or break a case.

Confession is a double-edged sword: powerful, but only if obtained fairly and documented properly.





NOIDA/NEW DELHI: For years, the narrow lanes of Nithari whispered the same story: children vanished, one after another, swallowed by a darkness no one could name.Inside D-5, where life seemed ordinary from the outside, investigators later uncovered fragments of a nightmare scattered through drains, courtyards and rooms that refused to give up their truth.Two decades on, Nithari remains less a crime scene and more a wound — a place where every unanswered question still walks the streets.The Nithari case remains one of country's most chilling and controversial serial-killing episodes. It centers around Bungalow D-5 in Nithari village, Noida and involves two men — the homeowner, Moninder Singh Pandher and his domestic helper, Surinder Koli The macabre tale that unfolded over years involved skeletal remains in drains, allegations of rape, murder, necrophilia, and organ trading — and a deeply flawed investigation that has haunted the judicial process for nearly two decades.The nightmare began in May 2006, when Nand Lal , father of a 22-year-old woman named Payal (also known as Deepika), reported her missing.Payal had visited Pandher’s bungalow D-5 in Sector 31, Nithari, allegedly to talk about a job for her brother — but she never returned.It was later reported that Koli had called her from a public phone booth.Despite the serious nature of the disappearance, the police response was strikingly delayed.According to a former investigator (then sub-inspector, later DSP), no FIR was registered for months.It was only after a court application under Section 156(3) of the CrPC, filed by Nand Lal, that an FIR was formally lodged on October 7, 2006 — nearly five months after Payal vanished.Things took a horrifying turn on December 29, 2006, when investigators discovered eight skeletal remains in a roadside drain next to the D-5 bungalow.This grim find, lead to the arrest of both Koli and Pandher. Within days, more bone fragments were unearthed in and around the drainage system.The discovery shook the nation and exposed the full extent of what had been a series of missing persons — children and young women — in and around Nithari.The initial investigation by the Uttar Pradesh Police came under criticism almost immediately. According to the first investigator, crucial delays had allowed the case to spiral: The FIR was filed only after months of pressure, and formal search operations began six months too late.These early lapses, he said, sowed the seeds of deeper problems.By January 10, 2007, due to mounting public outrage and the scale of the horror, the case was handed over to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).Within days, CBI teams conducted intensive searches around the bungalow and adjoining areas, recovering more human remains — skulls, bone pieces and dismembered body parts.The sheer scale of recovered remains made it difficult even for the investigators to determine how many victims there might have been.In the early months of the investigation, charge sheets were filed in 16 cases, spanning accusations of murder, rape, abduction, criminal conspiracy, destruction of evidence and more.On March 1, 2007, Koli made a highly detailed recorded confession.He reportedly admitted to murdering six children and one woman. He described luring them into the bungalow, strangling them, sexually abusing the bodies, dismembering them and discarding the remains in drains.He also made claims of cannibalism, stating that he sometimes cooked and ate flesh from the victims.The case proceeded in a special CBI court in Ghaziabad, and on February 13, 2009, both Koli and Pandher were sentenced to death in the first case.The trial court would go on to deliver verdicts over many years, across multiple hearings, more than 2,000 hearings were held during this prolonged trial.Koli was eventually convicted in 13 cases by the trial court and awarded death sentences in all, though one of these was commuted to life imprisonment.In a later case (May 2022), a special CBI court awarded him another death sentence for the rape and murder of a woman.While the trial court’s judgments were gruesome and seemed to close the case, the story was far from over.On September 11, 2009, the Allahabad high court delivered a big verdict: While upholding Koli’s death sentence, it acquitted Pandher in at least one prominent case, citing “no evidence” against him.Over time, Koli’s legal team mounted a fierce appeal. On October 16, 2023, in a landmark decision, the Allahabad high court acquitted Koli in 12 of the death-sentence cases and Pandher in two, overturning the trial court’s verdicts.The court did not mince words: It stated that the investigation had been botched up and that “basic norms of collecting evidence were brazenly violated.”A particularly scathing point in the high court’s judgment was the failure to probe possible organ trade — an angle raised by a high-level committee from the Ministry of Women and Child Development.Investigators, the court said, “opted for the easy course” by pinning blame on Koli and demonising him, instead of exploring deeper and more alarming conspiracies.The court also questioned the credibility of Koli’s confession. It noted procedural irregularities: the confession was allegedly recorded 60 days into police remand, yet there was no medical examination or independent witness.Moreover, the court highlighted contradictions in prosecution testimony about where and when the confession was made.Recovery of skeletal remains, according to the court, came from a drain outside the boundaries of Pandher’s house — not from inside, as had often been claimed.Ultimately, the court declared that the guilt of Koli and Pandher had not been proved beyond reasonable doubt, particularly because the case rested largely on circumstantial evidence.The judgment drew sharp criticism from victim families, who saw it as a deep betrayal after nearly two decades of pursuing justice.Following the high court’s 2023 acquittal, Moninder Singh Pandher was released from Luksar Jail on October 20, 2023, after spending 14 years behind bars.Surinder Koli, meanwhile, was not immediately freed — he continued to serve a life sentence in a separate conviction.But his legal fight was not over.In July 2025, the Supreme Court upheld the Allahabad HC’s acquittal of Koli in the 12 previously overturned cases. The apex court ruled that police lapses had rendered crucial evidence inadmissible.Then, on November 11, 2025, in a decisive moment, the Supreme Court accepted Koli’s curative plea (his last judicial recourse), acquitted him in the final pending case (Rimpa Haldar case) and ordered his immediate release.The man once dubbed the “Nithari killer” has now been acquitted in all major Nithari murder cases.When word of his acquittal reached his barrack, Koli had remained seated for some time, staring at the floor. Then a faint smile crossed his face. “He was relaxed, and there was a smile on his face,” a senior jail official told TOI.While Koli did give a detailed confession, the courts later scrutinised the conditions of its recording, It came long into police custody, without independent witnesses, and with no medical examination — casting shadows on its voluntariness and authenticity.Perhaps most damning was the court’s assertion that organ trade – a horrifying, but plausible, motive – was not properly probed.The investigation, according to the HC, seemed to choose the less difficult path of blaming a single man rather than confronting possible organised crime.One sacked officer, Simranjeet Kaur was arrested by the CBI in 2007 for allegedly framing false records to protect Pandher and Koli, having received payments.The mysterious death of a key witness, Jatin Sarkar, whose daughter was among the missing. His body was later found in a pond in Bengal.Parents of missing children watched as time passed with no clear answers. The high court’s 2023 acquittals were met with “dejection” by many, signaling that legal closure did not equal emotional closure.The community around Nithari, once traumatised by the gruesome revelations, still remembers the D-5 bungalow as a somber landmark.The Supreme Court’s acquittal in the 13th, and final, case against Koli left the families devastated.A 63-year-old Jhabbu Lal and his wife Sunita (60) continued seeking justice for their daughter Jyoti — one of the children who went missing in 2006 and was later found among the Nithari victims.“I had six children, and the fifth was Jyoti. She went missing in 2006,” Lal recalled, his voice shaking. “Her body was later found in the drain outside house number D5 (Moninder Pandher's bungalow where Koli worked).”Lal spent decades fighting in courts, selling valuables and even a house in Sangam Vihar, Delhi, to fund the case.Lal said, “If he didn’t commit the crime, then who did? If he is freed, that means someone else killed our children. Why was Koli kept behind bars for so many years?”Sunita Lal added, “Even after all these years, the pain hasn’t faded. Every time I pass that bungalow, it feels like I’m standing at the same place where my world ended. We never got our child back — only the memories and a lifetime of waiting for justice.”Another mother of a deceased said ""Moninder (Moninder Singh Pandher) and Surinder Koli, killed so many children. But the case is not being done anything about. Who is guilty now? Was there a ghost in that house which killed all children? They used to kill children and indulge in organ trafficking. Now they say that they are innocent. Law is letting them go; God won't.""When the Supreme Court finally granted his curative petition in November 2025 and ordered his immediate release, it marked the end of a long, fraught journey.The ruling underscored deep flaws in the original investigation: procedural lapses, contested confessions and weak evidence.Moninder Pandher, too, walked free earlier when the high court acquitted him.It was noted that during his release in October 2023, Pandher was frail, battling health issues including tuberculosis.The bungalow D-5, once infamous, now lies overgrown and decaying — a ghostly testament to the violence that took place there.Even when courts finally render a verdict, emotional justice may remain elusive for victims and their families.The Nithari killings case, is more than a crime story; it is a mirror to systemic failures, a cautionary tale about investigative hubris, and a study in how the quest for justice can stretch over decades.The courtroom battles — convictions, acquittals and final release — have reshaped public memory of D-5 bungalow.But the wounds remain: for the families who lost children, for a village scarred by horror, and for a nation forced to reckon with how easily its systems can be outpaced by darkness.","The Nithari case remains one of country's most chilling and controversial serial-killing episodes. It centers around Bungalow D-5 in Noida and involves two men — the homeowner, Moninder Singh Pandher and his domestic helper, Surinder Koli. Investigators later uncovered fragments of a nightmare scattered through drains, courtyards and rooms that refused to give up their truth.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125365659,imgsize-46652,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/-.jpg"

Insult meted out to my sister is intolerable: Tej Pratap

PATNA/NEW DELHI: RJD patriarch Lalu Prasad's daughter Rohini Acharya's outburst at her brother Tejashwi Yadav and his close associates for ""abusing"" and ""throwing"" her out of home is snowballing into a full-blown family feud and hints at increasing internal rumblings over the decisions of the party's anointed heir after its bid for office unravelled spectacularly in the assembly polls.As she dropped another bombshell on Sunday by saying she was dissed for donating her ""dirty kidney"" to Lalu and was accused of extracting crores of rupees and a Lok Sabha ticket, three of her sisters - Ragini, Chanda and Rajlakshmi - left their parents' Patna residence.Their brother Tej Pratap Yadav, disowned by his father and ousted from the party last year, spoke up against Rohini's ""humiliation"".Lalu, his younger son and political heir Tejashwi, and other family members have maintained silence, an indication of the division and conflicted emotions within. The party too has kept mum.Some party leaders suggested that differences among the siblings have long been simmering as Tejashwi took firmer control of the party and leaned on a set of advisers loyal to him to run its affairs. That arrangement has come up for questioning.But the Bihar assembly poll debacle has opened up this style of functioning to questioning. Rohini said everybody is wondering what fate has befallen RJD, a party that governed Bihar between 1990 and 2005.Tej Pratap said in a social media post, ""Yesterday's incident has shaken me. But the insult meted out to my sister is intolerable.""I tolerated whatever happened to me but her humiliation cannot be tolerated under any condition... The consequence of this injustice will be very dire.""He accused 'Jaichands' (betrayers), widely believed to be a reference to a couple of Tejashwi's close associates, including Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Yadav, of targeting the Yadav family. Appealing to Lalu, he said, ""Just one nod, and the people of Bihar will bury these Jaichands themselves. This fight is not for any party; it is for the honour of the family, the dignity of the daughter, and the self-respect of Bihar.""As the family fallout played out, TV footage showed three more daughters of Lalu's reaching Patna airport with their children to catch a flight, reportedly for Delhi. None of them spoke to the media. Incidentally, their departure came hours after Rohini advised women to ""look after your in-laws and families and take care of your children"" rather than parents.""I would tell all married women never to do anything to save their parents, and if they have a brother, they should ask him to donate his own kidney or ask his Haryanavi friend to do so,"" she said in an emotional post. She said she had committed a blunder by not obtaining permission from her husband and in-laws and not thinking about the future of her three children before donating a kidney to her father.Earlier, she alleged she was humiliated and abused, and a slipper was lifted to hit her. She said her parents, Lalu and Rabri Devi, both former CMs, were crying and blamed Sanjay Yadav and Rameez Nemat Khan, who hails from Uttar Pradesh and is said to be Tejashwi's friend, for her ""fate"".She named her brother too but directed most of her anger at his two associates.The developments followed RJD's disastrous performance in the just-held assembly elections in Bihar, in which the party could win only 25 seats after contesting 143. Tejashwi was officially projected as MGB's chief ministerial candidate.Meanwhile, the JD(U) asked Lalu to explain the developments and act. ""She is the daughter of entire Bihar, then why are you silent, Lalu ji... Please break your silence,"" JD(U) spokesperson Neeraj Kumar said.","Rohini Acharya's outburst at her brother Tejashwi Yadav and his close associates is snowballing into a full-blown family feud.

‘Misa-Priyanka Ko Dickey Mein…’: Yashwant Deshmukh’s Message to RJD–Cong After NDA’s Bihar Win

High votes, low wins: The big contradiction



Contest more seats



NDA's math clicked, MGB's math cracked



JD(U)'s comeback flipped the story



BJP grows bigger than ever



MGB slipped because allies didn't deliver



Jan Suraaj and AIMIM changed the margins



So, what really happened?



NEW DELHI: Bihar's 2025 election results threw up a story full of surprises. Tejashwi Yadav 's RJD turned out to be the party with highest vote share in the state, yet it ended up with one of its lowest seat tallies ever. On the other hand, the NDA kept the power with landslide victory, clinching over 200 seats in 243-member assembly, keeping the Mahagathbandhan far from the seat of government.RJD recorded a vote share of around 23 percent, just few decimals down from 2020, when it got 23.11 and emerged as the largest party with 75 seats. But this time, that same level of popularity translated into just 25 seats. So the striking question is: how can a party get the most votes, yet finish with so few seats?The answer lies in how votes were spread. RJD seems to have polled a large number of second-position votes. It remained popular, but not with enough concentrated support in winning zones.In simple terms, RJD got votes but not victories. This is no surprise in India's electoral mechanism of 'First Past the Post System.'RJD contested 143 seats this time, the highest among all parties across both the NDA and the Mahagathbandhan. In the 2020 assembly elections, the Lalu-led party had fielded one more candidate, contesting 144 seats.Contesting widely helped the party accumulate more total votes, contributing to the highest vote share. But losing candidates also add to vote share totals.Meanwhile, BJP and JD(U) fought on 101 seats each. They contested fewer seats but converted their votes efficiently into victories. That is why their seat count shot up, even with a lower vote share than RJD.A major turning point this election was the return of Chirag Paswan's LJP (Ram Vilas) to the NDA camp. In 2020, the LJP had hurt the NDA's chances by cutting into its votes, but this time its support helped strengthen the alliance instead of splitting it.In the previous election, LJP (RV) was unhappy with the NDA's seat-sharing formula in Bihar. Even though it was part of the alliance at the Centre, Chirag Paswan chose to go solo in the state and contested 134 seats, which ended up damaging NDA numbers—especially Nitish Kumar 's JD(U).Similarly, Upendra Kushwaha's party contested 104 seats independently in 2020, further cutting into votes that could have benefitted the NDA.This time, with both LJP (RV) and Kushwaha’s RLM back in the NDA fold, the alliance appeared far more united, organised, and prepared. The result: NDA outperformed the Mahagathbandhan by a wide margin.One of the biggest turnarounds happened in seats where RJD and JD(U) were in direct fight.In 2020, RJD dominated these contests. But in 2025, JD(U) turned the tables and won 50 out of 59, almost wiping out RJD in head-to-head battles. JD(U)'s vote share also jumped from 15.39 percent in 2020 to 19.25 percent this time, helping it win 85 seats from the tally of 43 last time.RJD simply failed to see this drastic reversal coming.The BJP crossed 89 seats, its highest tally ever in Bihar, marking a historic leap for a party that once had almost no grassroots base or ideological legacy in the state. By staying aligned for years with ""sushasan babu"" and steadily expanding its footprint, the saffron party has now grown into Bihar's biggest political force.With this mandate, the BJP has effectively redrawn the political map of Bihar. It now sits at the centre of power, holding the strongest bargaining position in the alliance. For years, Nitish Kumar played the ""big brother"" to the BJP, but for the second election in a row, the BJP has outperformed the JD(U), this time doing so with its best-ever numbers.The shift isn't just about arithmetic -- it's psychological. For decades, Bihar's political story revolved around the Lalu–Nitish axis. Today, it revolves around the BJP’s weight, influence and negotiating power.Unlike NDA, the Mahagathbandhan struggled with coordination and clarity.Congress contested on 61 seats as compared to last time's 70, but won only six. The Left parties, which surprised everyone in 2020, could not repeat their performance either. Seat-sharing disagreements and confusing ""friendly fights"" meant votes did not transfer smoothly within the alliance.The opposition was visible but not united -- and unity decides tight contests.Prashant Kishor's much-talked about startup -- Jan Suraaj did not open its account, but it made a strategic dent, in at least 35 seats, its vote share was higher than the winning margin, influencing outcomes for both alliances.Meanwhile, AIMIM repeated its strong Seemanchal performance, winning five seats with 1.85 percent of votes and signalling a shift in political thinking among Muslim voters.The traditional Muslim–Yadav (MY) vote base of the RJD showed signs of fragmentation, with Muslim voters exploring alternative platforms in multiple constituencies, leading to a near wipeout of the Mahagathbandhan in Seemanchal, barring one Congress candidate who scraped through.Mayawati's BSP also registered a presence, securing 1.62% of the total vote share with one seat in the west.RJD did not lose popularity, but lost positional advantage. It remained a strong choice for many voters but could not cross the finishing line often enough. High vote share created the impression of strength, but seats reflect actual power -- and that is where NDA towered above everyone.","RJD recorded a vote share of around 23 percent, just few decimals down from 2020. But this time, that same level of popularity translated into just 25 seats. RJD seems to have polled a large number of second-position votes, but not with enough concentrated support in winning zones.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125363704,imgsize-759459,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-99.jpg"

The tally was three for LJP-RV and one for RLM.In the MGB camp, RJD was the winner in nine of these seats while Congress won two. One seat each went to CPM, CPIML-L and IIP.Despite his amplified presence on the social media, many critics of the party had claimed that Prashant Kishor would at best be a spoiler.Some felt his upper caste identity meant he would cut into BJP's vote while others argued he would divide the anti-incumbency youth votes since he was talking about issues like migration from the state.","In 35 constituencies, the party's votes were higher than the winning margin.

‘Misa-Priyanka Ko Dickey Mein…’: Yashwant Deshmukh’s Message to RJD–Cong After NDA’s Bihar Win

NEW DELHI: Lalu Prasad Yadav 's daughter, Rohini Acharya, who announced her separation from both her family and the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) on Saturday, has now levelled fresh and explosive allegations against her brother and party leader Tejashwi Yadav . Just a day after declaring she was distancing herself, Rohini accused Tejashwi of humiliating and abusing her, claiming that matters escalated to the point where ""a slipper was raised to hit her. ""Taking to X, Rohini wrote an emotional post, stating she was forced to leave behind her aged parents, Lalu Prasad Yadav and Rabri Devi - in tears while protecting her dignity. She posted writing in Hindi, which translates to: ""Yesterday, a daughter, a sister, a married woman, a mother was humiliated, filthy abuses were hurled at her, a slipper was raised to hit her. I did not compromise on my self-respect, I did not surrender the truth, and solely because of this, I had to endure this insult. Yesterday, a daughter, out of compulsion, left behind her crying parents and sisters and came away; they tore me away from my maternal home. They left me orphaned. May none of you ever walk my path, may no family ever have a daughter-sister like Rohini.""In a second post, Rohini referred to her kidney donation to her father in 2022 while alleging that personal and offensive remarks were made about it. She wrote that she was taunted for having ""put a filthy kidney"" into her father and accused of having ""taken millions of rupees and bought a ticket"" for the transplant.She further posted, ""If there’s a son or brother in your parents’ home, then… tell your brother to get a kidney transplant from himself or his Haryanvi mates instead. ""Rohini also wrote, ""All you sisters and daughters, look after your own home and family… without a thought for your parents… with me, it was a massive sin to not look after my family or my three children, to not get permission from my husband or my in-laws before donating… which today has been branded as filthy.""A day earlier, Rohini had already shocked RJD supporters by alleging, ""I have no family. You can go and ask this to Sanjay Yadav, Rameez, and Tejashwi Yadav.

NAVI MUMBAI: Nerul police have filed an FIR against Amit Thackeray , the son of MNS chief Raj Thackeray and 70 MNS workers including office bearers for defying police prevention and forcibly unveiling the statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj in a canopy constructed by NMMC at a junction in sector -1, Nerul near Rajiv Gandhi flyover on Sunday afternoon.The accused have been booked under relevant sections of BNS for assault or criminal force against a public servant, voluntarily causing hurt to a public servant in the discharge of their duty, unlawful assembly, rioting, joint liability and mischief causing loss or damage to property along with relevant sections of Maharashtra Police Act. The accused are Amit Thackeray, chief of Maharashtra Vidyarthi Sena, Mumbai, Gajanan Kale, MNS President of Navi Mumbai City and Abhijit Desai, MNS Nerul unit chief among other MNS workers, informed Brahmanand Naikwadi, senior inspector of Nerul.Inspector Naikwadi said, ""The accused had took out a morcha without permission and gathering unlawfully assaulted the on-duty Assistant police inspector Nilesh Chavan and also created obstruction in government work by disregarding the instructions given by the police and also maliciously damaged the net installed around the statue by NMMC.""During his visit to Nerul, Amit Thackeray got annoyed after seeing that the statue of Maratha King was covered in a cloth on which dust had accumulated, as NMMC had delayed the unveiling since Feb last year.As Nerul police learnt that Amit Thackeray was going to unofficially unveil the statue, a police team from Nerul was deployed at the spot to prevent the unofficial unveiling of the statue of Maratha King. But, the MNS workers accompanying Thackeray vehemently protested defying the police prevention and forcibly reached the canopy and tore apart the cloth covering the statue after which Thackeray himself washed the statue.Gajanan Kale, MNS President of Navi Mumbai said, ""Despite repeated communication with NMMC since Feb last year demanding unveiling of the statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj at Nerul chowk built with an expenditure of around Rs 46 lakhs, the concerned civic authorities have been ignoring as probably they are waiting for appointment of CM Devendra Fadnavis. As the cloth used to cover the statue had become dirty, it was indeed desecration of the statue of Maratha king. Hence, Amit Thackeray took the lead to unveil the statue and himself washed the statue.""NMMC has released a presser stating that, the unveiling the statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj in Nerul was not done by NMMC. Actually, the construction work around the statue has not been completed yet and is in the final stages. Therefore, the ceremonial installation of the statue was to be announced soon. Unveiling the statue without taking permission from the concerned authority and without giving any prior notice is very wrong and unauthorized from the point of view of law and order.","Nerul police have filed an FIR against Amit Thackeray and 70 MNS workers.

Swifties think Taylor Swift’s ‘The Fate of Ophelia’ is aimed directly at Joe Alwyn

More coverage on NFL:





Taylor Swift’s latest track, “The Fate of Ophelia,” is sparking a fresh wave of online theories and Swifties are convinced she’s weaving real-life heartbreak into a Shakespeare-inspired narrative. The song, featured on The Life of a Showgirl, flips the tragic Ophelia storyline into one of revival, and fans immediately tie the imagery to Taylor’s emotional journey after her six-year relationship with Joe Alwyn.With lyrics that feel pointed, timing that feels deliberate, and symbolism that leans heavily into themes of rescue, rebirth, and choosing a new path, this track has become the latest cultural flashpoint as listeners dissect what Taylor may be saying between the lines.Swifties didn’t waste time pulling receipts. The lyric “dug me out of my grave” is being hailed as a symbolic nod to Travis, the man fans believe helped lift Taylor from the emotional stagnation she experienced during her long romance with Joe. And the shade? It’s there in sharpened form.When Taylor Swift sings, “All that time, I sat alone in my tower / You were just honing your powers,” listeners immediately connected it to Joe’s famously private lifestyle and his recent role in a new Hamlet film.The overlap between Ophelia, Hamlet, and Taylor’s real-life history is simply too on-the-nose for fans to ignore.What makes this moment hit even harder is how openly Taylor seems to be reclaiming her narrative. Rather than turning her breakup into bitterness, she’s framing it as the final chapter of a darker era, one that allowed her to rise stronger and choose a love that fits her world rather than hides from it. Joe, for his part, has subtly signaled he’s over the conversation, reportedly saying he’s moved on and suggesting fans do the same. But Swifties aren’t budging.For Taylor, this track feels like a mic-drop: a poetic goodbye to the past, a wink at the present, and a reminder that she’ll always turn heartbreak into art, even if some people would prefer not to be name-checked in her mythology.","Taylor Swift's new song, 'The Fate of Ophelia,' is fueling fan theories linking it to her breakup with Joe Alwyn.

Will Travis Kelce play today?

More coverage on NFL:





The Kansas City Chiefs have spent the week preparing for one of their most pivotal games of the season, and naturally, the biggest question on fans’ minds is whether Travis Kelce will be on the field when they face the surging Denver Broncos. As the Broncos sit at an impressive 8-2 and continue to gain national attention, the Chiefs know they need every offensive weapon available, especially their All-Pro tight end.Kelce has been at the center of the conversation not only for what he brings physically, but for the leadership and urgency he expressed this week on New Heights. His comments offered rare insight into how seriously Kansas City is taking this matchup and what he believes it will require to win.Yes, Travis Kelce is expected to play today, with no injury setbacks reported during the week. He has practiced fully and appears locked in mentally, bringing a sense of urgency to a matchup that could shape the AFC West race.Kelce’s own breakdown of the Broncos makes his mindset clear. When Jason Kelce joked that Kansas City should “spot ‘em seven,” the tight end didn’t hesitate to shut it down. “That’s not how that works,” he said.“Nobody in their right mind is just like, ‘Let’s spot ’em seven.’ I think we’re going to try and start fast and finish even faster. I think that’s going to be the key to the game right there.”Travis Kelce’s assessment isn’t just talk. Denver has scored first in only one of their ten games, yet they dominate late, ranking third in the NFL with 96 fourth-quarter points. Their formula revolves around resilience, slow starts, strong finishes, and a defense that has kept them competitive even when their offense cools off.He also highlighted how complete the Broncos have become under Sean Payton, saying, “I think right now the Broncos are playing so well together… They’re playing great defense. And then in those big moments, their offense keeps finding ways to win football games.”With Kelce healthy, motivated, and fully aware of Denver’s strengths, the Chiefs will lean heavily on him today. And based on his tone, he plans to set that “fast start, faster finish” standard himself.",Travis Kelce is set to play against the Denver Broncos.

Who Wins This Trade?

Final Outlook: A Potential Offseason Earthquake





The MLB offseason has taken a dramatic turn as the Toronto Blue Jays have surfaced as a projected frontrunner to acquire elite outfielder Kyle Tucker. Widely regarded as one of baseball’s most complete two-way stars, Tucker’s sudden availability has reshaped the league’s trade conversation. His blend of power hitting, defensive value, and age-advantaged upside has made him one of the most sought-after names on the market, and Toronto appears ready to pursue him with full force.What makes this rumor especially compelling is the timing. The Toronto Blue Jays enter the new season facing pressure to retool a roster that has repeatedly come close to a deep postseason run but has lacked game-changing consistency from the middle of the lineup. Kyle Tucker represents exactly the sort of megastar addition who could elevate them from fringe contender to legitimate championship threat. With the outfielder inching toward free agency and the Astros dealing with payroll constraints, the trade landscape has shifted just enough to push this blockbuster scenario closer to reality.The crux of this developing trade scenario revolves around Houston’s willingness to move Kyle Tucker before his price escalates further.His next contract is projected by many insiders to far exceed $400 million, making him one of the future highest-paid players in MLB. As Houston considers its long-term financial structure, a trade offers a chance to gain controllable young talent while avoiding a massive future commitment.Toronto, meanwhile, sees a rare opportunity to land a perennial All-Star entering his prime. The Jays have the prospect capital to make a competitive offer, but the deal would likely require them to part with top-tier farm talent or even major-league-ready contributors. The situation mirrors a previous significant trade where the Cubs secured Kyle Tucker in exchange for a major prospect haul, setting a precedent that Toronto must be prepared to match or exceed.Landing Kyle Tucker would immediately enhance Toronto’s run-producing ability. His track record - multiple seasons hitting above .280 with 23+ home runs and more than 100 RBIs when healthy - fills a major need for consistent, middle-order firepower. Beyond numbers, he brings star appeal, boosting marketability and energizing a fanbase waiting for a marquee acquisition.A move to Toronto could unlock a new chapter in Tucker’s career. He would step into a strong lineup, receive a platform in a major media market, and likely secure a record-breaking long-term deal. From both financial and competitive standpoints, the Blue Jays offer an attractive landing spot.• Major offensive upgrade with reliable power and run production.• Coverage for potential departures, including the possibility of losing Bo Bichette in the future.• Increased ticket sales, fan engagement, and brand visibility.• Significant financial flexibility ahead of Tucker’s predicted megadeal.• A youth infusion that keeps the franchise competitive without fully resetting.• Potentially higher earning power and a bigger spotlight.• Opportunity to become the face of a rising contender.• High prospect cost, which could strip future depth.• Tucker’s recent injury concerns—including the shin fracture and 2024 missed time—add risk.• Immediate decline in lineup power and overall star quality.• Risk that young players acquired may take years to develop or fail to meet expectations.• Stress of changing leagues, cities, and expectations.• Toronto’s intense baseball culture brings heightened scrutiny.In the short term, Toronto would be the clear winner if Kyle Tucker stays healthy. His age, production, and defensive ability fit perfectly into the Toronto Blue Jays’ competitive timeline. For Houston, the true verdict depends on the development of the prospects they receive. Should even one or two become impact starters, the Astros could ultimately claim the long-term win.For Tucker, the move is a win if he secures the massive contract projections tied to his name and thrives in a hitters-friendly environment with a competitive roster around him.If completed, this trade would electrify the entire league. The Toronto Blue Jays would enter the season armed with one of baseball’s most explosive outfields, the Astros would gain the pieces needed to sustain future success, and Kyle Tucker would take a major step forward in both fame and financial security. The risk is real for all parties, but the reward is equally massive.Also read: MLB trade rumors: New York Mets could land $220 million ex Houston Atros ace pitchers to anchor a championship-caliber staff The upcoming offseason promises drama, speculation, and perhaps a blockbuster move that redefines the AL landscape.

"NHL Injury Update: Charlie McAvoy out after a slapshot in the Montreal Canadiens, return timeline unclear",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/nhl-injury-update-charlie-mcavoy-out-after-a-slapshot-in-the-montreal-canadiens-return-timeline-unclear/articleshow/125366743.cms,"Charlie McAvoy (Image Via Twitter)

How serious is Charlie McAvoy’s injury, and when could he return?





Those who follow the sport of hockey closely are aware that the game situation can change rapidly, and the Boston Bruins' physical approach has been a great source of excitement in arenas all over North America for quite a long time. Players like Charlie McAvoy, not only due to their skills, but also the maximum effort and toughness they display throughout the game, become very recognizable when watching the NHL intensely. The fans of the Bruins and American hockey lovers in general are very much aware of McAvoy, the most important defender, whose being on the rink usually determines the outcome of the decisive games. The talk about the players in the team always involves McAvoy, thus making a single update about his fitness situation a matter of very high interest for not only the local supporters but also the international ones.The thrill turned into a tense moment at the Bell Centre in Montreal on Saturday. During the second period, Charlie McAvoy was hit in the face with a slapshot from Canadiens defenseman Noah Dobson. He collapsed at once, and the Bruins’ medical staff helped him off the ice. According to The Canadian Press, fellow player Nikita Zadorov was spotted trying to collect teeth that had fallen out during the incident. Bruins coach Marco Sturm said that McAvoy was being tested after the game, hoping he could travel safely with the team.Sportsnet's Elliotte Friedman later informed that McAvoy did fly back with the team, but his condition for the next game is still unclear.Charlie McAvoy was unable to play because of an upper-body injury. The management of the team declared him out before the third period, and now he is questionable for Monday’s matchup against the Carolina Hurricanes. The head athletic trainer of the Bruins, Dustin Stuck, escorted him off the ice and to Montreal's medical personnel. Players showed worries with David Pastrnak saying, “Praying for him that everything’s going to be fine. ” The previous shoulder injury McAvoy had during last season’s 4 Nations Face-Off adds to the caution surrounding his recovery. In case McAvoy is out, Henri Jokiharju is likely to be the one taking his place in the lineup. The fans, analysts, and U.S. Olympic supporters will be very dependent on the updates during the next few days, and even the league’s top defender being eligible to play will not be the same without the injury issue.The Charlie McAvoy injury has made it very hard for even the Bruins fans and the U.S. hockey supporters to breathe, and the situation perfectly illustrates the unpredictability of the sport. Still, it is not clear when the player will be back for the upcoming games, but the team will remain focused on his full recovery and on providing him a safe return to the ice. Boston and Team USA watching the world will be through McAvoy's resilience and skill, and the fans will be receiving their updates as the Bruins take on the rest of their season.More coverage on NHL","Charlie McAvoy was hit in the face with a slapshot from Canadiens defenseman Noah Dobson.

Justin Tucker faces uncertain NFL return after serving suspension





More NFL coverage





Justin Tucker’s name is back in NFL conversations, but not because of a game-winning kick. The former Baltimore Ravens star has completed his 10-game suspension and is finally eligible to return. Now the league waits to see if any team is willing to sign him after months of headlines, allegations and intense scrutiny. His return window is open, yet his future remains uncertain as front offices weigh talent against controversy.Tucker, once viewed as one of the most reliable kickers in football, is now trying to rebuild his career at a time when several teams are desperate for stability. He has served his full punishment under the NFL’s personal conduct policy, and his reinstatement clears the path for a comeback. Whether that comeback actually happens will depend on who is willing to take the risk.Justin Tucker can return to the field if he signs with a team. His 10-game suspension for violating the NFL’s personal conduct policy is complete, and he is now free to join any roster. The Ravens released him in May after allegations of sexual misconduct surfaced. Sixteen Baltimore-area massage therapists accused him of inappropriate behavior between 2012 and 2016.As the claims spread, Tucker and his wife, Amanda, denied the accusations. He said, “It devastates me to know that anyone I have worked with would not have felt respected. To anyone who has felt otherwise, I am sorry.”The NFL launched its own investigation and suspended him in June. He served the suspension as a free agent, officially becoming eligible to return on Nov. 11. Despite the controversy, NFL Network reported earlier that he had interest from several teams.Tucker’s resume is still impressive. He is a seven-time Pro Bowler and five-time All-Pro with an 89.1 percent career accuracy rate, ranking him among the best kickers in league history. He also set the 66-yard field goal record in 2021 before it was topped this season. But his final year in Baltimore raised concerns. He hit just 73.3 percent of his attempts and went 6 of 11 from 50 yards or more.Teams like the Rams, Falcons and Packers have struggled with consistency this season, making Justin Tucker a possible option despite the backlash that may follow. As the playoff push intensifies, reliability becomes priceless. That might give Tucker the opening he needs, even if the decision comes with consequences for whichever team signs him.","Justin Tucker can return to the field if he signs with a team.

‘Misa-Priyanka Ko Dickey Mein…’: Yashwant Deshmukh’s Message to RJD–Cong After NDA’s Bihar Win

Who are Sanjay Yadav and Rameez?

Mahagathbandhan's

NEW DELHI: Hours after announcing publicly that she had severed ties with her family, Lalu Prasad Yadav ’s daughter, Rohini Acharya, claimed she was ""thrown out"" by her brother, Tejashwi Yadav , and his close aides, Sanjay Yadav and Rameez. Speaking on the Rashtriya Janata Dal 's (RJD) debacle in the Bihar assembly polls, Rohini said she was ""disgraced, abused, and even hit"" when she questioned Sanjay Yadav and Rameez.""I have no family. You can go and ask this to Sanjay Yadav, Rameez, and Tejashwi Yadav. They are the ones who threw me out of the family. They don't want to take any responsibility... The whole nation is asking why the party failed like this. When you name Sanjay Yadav and Rameez, you are thrown out of the house, disgraced, abused, and even hit,"" Rohini told news agency ANI.Sanjay Yadav referred to in Acharya’s post is a close aide of her brother Tejashwi Yadav, the RJD-ledchief ministerial face in Bihar. Born in Haryana in 1984, Sanjay Yadav joined the RJD in 2012 and was sent to the Rajya Sabha by the party in 2024.Rameez, meanwhile, is reportedly an old friend of Tejashwi Yadav and comes from a political family in the neighbouring Uttar Pradesh.Earlier, taking all the blame, Rohini hit out at Sanjay Yadav for her decision and alleged that it was Sanjay Yadav and Rameez who ""asked"" her to do so.""I’m quitting politics and I’m disowning my family … This is what Sanjay Yadav and Rameez had asked me to do …nd I’m taking all the blame’s,"" she wrote on X.On Rohini's decision, BJP's Bihar chief Dilip Jaiswal said: ""Rohini Acharya has donated her kidney to save Lalu Yadav. The way Lalu Yadav's family is constantly falling apart due to one or two individuals, no one will like it. I also want to say that if a family is falling apart because of one person, it is not right.""The RJD, which was the largest party in the Mahagathbandhan, saw its tally collapse from 75 to just 25 seats -- one of its most disappointing performances since 2010. The dramatic slide, which resulted in the loss of over 100 seats to NDA allies, came despite the coalition uniting behind Tejashwi Yadav as its chief ministerial face.Overall, the Mahagathbandhan vote share and seat count fell sharply, ending below the 40-seat mark and far from government formation. In contrast, the BJP emerged as the strongest performer within the NDA, winning 89 seats, its highest-ever tally in Bihar.The JD(U), led by Nitish Kumar, secured 85 seats, while Chirag Paswan’s LJP (RV) posted an impressive strike rate by winning 19 of the 29 seats it contested. HAM won 5 seats and Upendra Kushwaha’s party claimed 4.","Lalu Prasad Yadav’s daughter, Rohini Acharya, claims she was ""thrown out"" by her brother, Tejashwi Yadav, and his close aides, Sanjay Yadav and Rameez.

How are Ty Gretzky, Sara Gretzky, and rest of the Wayne Gretzky family staying in the spotlight?







Wayne Gretzky's son, Ty Gretzky created an Instagram post that was both very emotional and very beautiful to celebrate Sara Gretzky’s birthday, and the post was immediately accepted by the fans. Rather than a plain message, Ty wrote a carousel that combined love and tenderness with nostalgia and spontaneous family cuteness, giving the relationship of Sara with their daughters—Sicily and Vienna—the first place. The tribute began with an outdoor picture of Sara on the ground with both girls on her lap, a situation that showed the softness and comfort of their daily family life. The carousel then took one through different scenes that were at the same time close and grand, echoing a year that was full of memories, and which Ty was very fond of.The post went on with seasonal pictures, one of which was taken in a holiday-decorated porch where Sara, in winter clothes, had the girls snuggled up to her. A video where she was having fun dancing with Sicily and Vienna was also shown, and this was the moment Ty emphasized in his writing, telling her to ""Never stop dancing with the girls."" He counterpoised the lively moments with quiet, warm family life scenes—like a movie theater selfie where Sara was cuddling Ty and one daughter was posing dramatically with popcorn.A dinner outing photo showed Sara assisting one of the girls in blowing out the candles on a dessert while behind them, festive lights were shining. More pictures portrayed a palm-tree-lined plaza walk, the clouds at a beach, and a hotel hallway scene behind a double stroller, reminding the public that the family's happiness spreads wherever they go.Ty and Sara, who were married in 2020 with a modern Gatsby-inspired ceremony in Brooklyn, had a baby named Sicily in 2021 and another one, Vienna, in 2023. The hockey legend’s son, Ty, is personally responsible for his coaching capacity in Gretzky Hockey School, which means he is staying involved with the development of youngsters. On the other hand, Wayne Gretzky finished a busy international tour recently, according to Canadian media. He was in Scotland and Slovakia, for instance, meeting Karen Mollica, the ambassador, and attending a leadership conference in Bratislava, where he also signed T-shirts for kids. This trip followed the 2025 Alfred Dunhill Links Championship that he attended with his son-in-law, Dustin Johnson.Ty Gretzky’s touching tribute shone the spotlight on Sara’s pivotal role in the family, but also revealed the close, worldwide rhythm of the Gretzkys. The family had a celebration full of love, connection, and memories that the fans undeniably accepted.More coverage on NHL","Wayne Gretzky's son, Ty, created an Instagram post that was both very emotional and very beautiful.

Candace Owens explains her list of “verifiable lies” told after Charlie Kirk’s assassination



Image via Candace/Podcast

She said the first lie was the story that Mikey McCoy had “blood all over him.” She said this story was made up and was told by Pastor Rob McCoy.

The second lie, she said, came from Alex Clark and Andrew Kolvet. She said they pushed a story that Charlie Kirk was a “committed evangelical” who only liked Catholic buildings. Owens said this was not true.

The third lie was a strange story that Charlie Kirk’s “strong bones” stopped a 30-06 bullet. She said Andrew Kolvet pushed this and that it made no sense.

The fourth lie, she said, was the claim that Charlie “never blinked” in his support for Israel. Candace Owens said this was not true.

For the fifth lie, she said TPUSA told people that Mikey McCoy first called his dad during the crisis. Owens said this story was also false.

The sixth lie was about Terryl Farnsworth, the AV worker. She said TPUSA claimed police told him to remove cameras. Owens said her video review shows this did not happen.

The seventh lie was the claim that Farnsworth moved SD cards because “people were stealing them.” She said this made no sense because SD cards are cheap and cameras are expensive.

The eighth lie came from Alex Clark, who said there was “no bad blood” between Ben Shapiro and Charlie Kirk. Owens said that was “propaganda.”

The ninth lie was that TPUSA’s yearly audits proved nothing odd. Candace Owens said this was misleading because Doge worked differently from normal TPUSA work.

The tenth lie was calling Mikey McCoy a “hero.” Candace Owens said this was not fair because he did not call 911 right away.





Candace Owens spoke on her podcast on November 13, 2025. She said she found ten “verifiable lies” that she believes Turning Point USA (TPUSA) told after Charlie Kirk was killed. Charlie Kirk was shot in the neck on September 10, 2025, at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah. The next day, 22-year-old Tyler James Robinson was arrested for the shooting. Owens said she will keep talking about this case because she feels she is getting “very close” to the real truth, and she believes some people at TPUSA are upset with her for this.In her show, Candace Owens said TPUSA gave wrong or confusing stories about what happened that day. She said some stories made people sound more heroic, more loyal, or more important than they really were.

Upper-body setback sidelines Seth Jarvis for Carolina Hurricanes



More coverage on NHL:





The Carolina Hurricanes experienced a concerning moment on Friday night when forward Seth Jarvis was forced to leave the game due to an upper-body setback. During a play behind the net, Jarvis was struck near the eye by teammate Andrei Svechnikov’s high stick. He did not return for the remainder of the first period, with the team listing the incident as an upper-body issue. The play was sudden and highlighted the physical intensity of NHL games, even in routine situations.Jarvis has been a key contributor for Carolina this season, entering the night with 10 goals and five assists through 16 games. At 23 years old, his offensive production has been integral to the Hurricanes’ early-season performance, and his temporary absence may affect line rotations and scoring depth. Known for his speed, vision, and scoring ability, Jarvis has emerged as one of Carolina’s most promising young forwards.Injuries involving the upper body, particularly near the eye, are taken seriously due to their potential impact on a player’s vision, mobility, and overall performance. Carolina’s coaching and medical staff are monitoring his condition closely, focusing on a cautious approach to ensure full recovery.Even a short absence can influence team dynamics, and the Hurricanes are likely to make tactical adjustments to maintain offensive balance while he recovers.The incident underscores the physical risks inherent in professional hockey, where even routine plays can have unexpected consequences. Carolina’s depth chart may need adjustments while Jarvis is unavailable, with other forwards stepping into increased responsibilities. His experience and familiarity with the team’s systems will be missed, but the organization is prepared to adapt while evaluating the full extent of his setback. Updates on Jarvis’ status are expected in the coming days as the Hurricanes’ medical team continues its assessment.Additionally, this injury could influence upcoming matchups as the Hurricanes manage their roster and line combinations. Coaching staff may adjust strategies, modify power-play and penalty-kill units, and shift responsibilities among forwards to compensate for Jarvis’ absence. Maintaining offensive consistency without Jarvis will be a priority, while ensuring he receives proper care to return at full strength.","Seth Jarvis was struck near the eye by teammate Andrei Svechnikov's high stick.

Seahawks mourn Kenny Easley: Hall of Fame safety dies at 66, cause still not public



Dialysis three times a week





A full kidney transplant in 1990





A long recovery that forced him to rebuild his life away from football





More coverage from NFL:







When news broke that Seattle Seahawks legend Kenny Easley had passed away at 66, the NFL world felt the shock instantly. Fans, former teammates, and Hall of Fame members all reacted with the same heavy silence because the Enforcer wasn’t just a player. He was a presence. And now that voice is gone.Easley died on November 14, 2025, according to confirmations from the Pro Football Hall of Fame and his family. But one crucial detail remains unknown: no cause of death has been released.And that mystery has left many revisiting the long, difficult health journey that shaped Easley’s life long after he left the field.But what we do know is this: no official source has linked his death to any past health condition. Until the family or medical authorities release more information, the cause of death remains undisclosed.This silence has left fans wondering especially because Easley had a well-documented medical history that dramatically changed the course of his life.Long before his Hall of Fame induction, Easley suffered through one of the toughest medical battles an athlete can face.In the late 1980s, he was diagnosed with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome, a severe kidney disorder that ultimately ended his NFL career at just 28 years old.At the time, it shocked the league, he was in his prime, playing at an elite level, and widely considered one of the greatest safeties of his generation.The situation grew more painful when Easley later revealed the underlying cause. In a lawsuit, he claimed that excessive ibuprofen use, a common pain-management routine in the NFL had worsened his kidney failure.His life quickly turned into a medical fight:Even after the transplant, he carried the weight of that diagnosis for decades. Easley’s medical battles didn’t stop with the kidney transplant.In 2016, he underwent triple-bypass heart surgery, another major challenge that could have easily knocked him down. But in true Kenny Easley fashion, he bounced back, showing up for Seahawks events, supporting charitable causes, and remaining a powerful voice in the Seattle community.But even then, he stayed private about his health. And that privacy continues today, with his family choosing not to release the cause of death.His death at 66 leaves behind unanswered questions, yes. But it also leaves behind an undeniable legacy, a reminder that greatness doesn’t always last long, but it always lasts loud.","Easley died on November 14, 2025, according to confirmations from the Pro Football Hall of Fame and his family.

Valtteri Bottas supports Oscar Piastri and says F1 can be “not a fair sport”





Oscar Piastri is watching his 2025 Formula 1 title hopes fade as his lead over teammate Lando Norris has fully disappeared. Earlier in the season, Oscar Piastri was ahead by 34 points. But now, in November, he is 24 points behind after a tough run of races. This swing happened after the summer break, and it has placed the young Australian under heavy pressure during an important part of the season.Lando Norris has been very strong since the break. Among his four consecutive podium finishes are major victories in Brazil and Mexico. His Mexico victory came with a substantial 30-second lead; his victory in Brazil came with a clear 10-second lead. On the other hand, Oscar Piastri hasn't stepped onto the podium since Monza, six races ago. Including Valtteri Bottas's comments, this disparity has sparked several paddock talks.Valtteri Bottas spoke about Oscar Piastri’s situation this week and showed strong support. He told 7News Adelaide that he knew the feeling well from his time racing with Lewis Hamilton at Mercedes between 2017 and 2021.Valtteri Bottas said, “I’ve been there. Been there, mate. It’s a tough sport.It’s not a fair sport. Sometimes you just deal with it. Oscar has so much time ahead of him. He has a great career ahead. Sometimes you need patience.”Valtteri Bottas also talked to CODE Sports, saying he still hopes Oscar Piastri can win the 2025 title. He said, “I am rooting for him for the title. He still has a chance.”Including the Qatar Grand Prix, which has a Sprint Race with eight bonus points, Oscar Piastri has three race weekends remaining to narrow the 24-point margin. Just 25 points behind Oscar Piastri, Max Verstappen is also battling for second in the championship.Former Haas head Guenther Steiner also offered Oscar Piastri some harsh words. He suggested Oscar Piastri quit McLaren if he is unable to return better following this year.Guenther Steiner said Oscar Piastri faced “mysterious problems” during the American races and had to change parts of his driving style.Also Read: Olympic Legend Surya Bonaly Loses All Her Medals To Las Vegas Thieves While Caring For Her Cancer-Stricken Mother Steiner said Oscar Piastri must reset over the winter or think about switching teams.The next race is the Las Vegas Grand Prix, where McLaren struggled in 2024.

New Orleans Pelicans cut ties with Willie Green after a brutal 2-10 collapse,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/new-orleans-pelicans-cut-ties-with-willie-green-after-a-brutal-2-10-collapse/articleshow/125352151.cms,"(Image Source - Getty Images)

New Orleans Pelicans front office ends Willie Green’s tenure hours after reviewing the team’s direction





The New Orleans Pelicans made a clear and firm decision when they fired Willie Green only hours after a 118-104 home loss to the Los Angeles Lakers on November 14. The move came after a start that did not meet the standards of a team coming off a 49-33 season. New Orleans opened 0-6 and became the first team in NBA history to lose three of its first six games by at least 30 points. The team also allowed 120 points or more in each of its first five games, marking the worst defensive opening in franchise history.These results left little room for interpretation. The performance level was not close to what the roster was built for, and the front office responded. Willie Green addressed the pressure earlier in the season and spoke about staying focused on the players, but the issues remained the same across multiple games. If you look at how the season went, the firing was based strictly on the on-court product and the urgent need to change direction. The Pelicans acted decisively because the stats from the early weeks supported a major adjustment.Pelicans Executive Vice President of Basketball Operations Joe Dumars delivered the news in a statement released by the team on Saturday morning. ""After careful evaluation, we have made the difficult decision to make a change at head coach,"" Dumars said in the official announcement.He added, ""I have the utmost respect for Willie Green, and I’m sincerely appreciative of his contributions to the Pelicans organization and the New Orleans community. We wish him and his family all the best in the future.""Team owner Gayle Benson backed the move in a separate statement issued the same day. ""I have tremendous admiration and respect for Willie Green, and I truly appreciate all he has done for our organization over the last few years,"" Benson said. ""This is a tough business and these are difficult decisions.""In a recent interview prior to the firing, Benson had expressed urgency about the team's direction, ""We need to improve immediately. Our roster is built for success right now."" She also reiterated her confidence in Dumars, stating, ""I really like Willie Green, but I hired Joe Dumars to assess our basketball operation. And that’s what he is doing.""Dumars had previously defended retaining Green after a disappointing 21-61 finish in the 2024-25 season, the second-worst record in franchise history for an 82-game campaign. Speaking to media in May 2025, Dumars said, ""I'm looking forward to going forward and working with Willie and to push us to success. You've got to set the bar. And that's what we're going to do."" He focused on the desired style of play, adding, ""The style of play — resilience, toughness, playing hard, never quit — that’s what we want people to see right away. ""The New Orleans Pelicans were done hoping the same approach would fix itself. Willie Green had four-plus seasons and two playoff runs, but the early problems kept repeating. Add injuries to Zion Williamson and Dejounte Murray, and the team looked stuck again. Putting James Borrego in charge is their attempt to wake the roster up before the season gets even harder to recover from.Also Read: Stephen Curry seen rocking Nike just a day after ending his Under Armour partnership in a match against San Antonio Spurs",New Orleans Pelicans front office ends Willie Green's tenure hours after reviewing the team’s direction.

As the 2026 Indian Premier League approaches, Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) enter the new season with a long history of strong squads, heavy expectations and a fan base that has remained one of the most loyal in the tournament.Their journey across seasons has swung between high-scoring spectacles, deep playoff pushes and repeated attempts to secure the league’s most elusive prize.That pursuit finally ended with their title breakthrough last season. RCB produced one of their most complete campaigns, driven by consistent top-order runs, reliable middle-overs control and a bowling group that delivered in pressure situations.Several players stood out through the year, forming the spine of the championship run and shaping the core the team now carries into 2026.Virat Kohli led the charge with 657 runs, producing eight half-centuries, that too, all in wins, and setting the tone with his aggressive approach in the powerplay. Phil Salt complemented him with rapid starts of his own, striking at 175.98 and consistently breaking open the first six overs.Rajat Patidar’s return as captain added stability, with crucial early-season half-centuries in important away wins that helped steady the side’s route to the final.Their bowling unit matched the batting group’s impact as well. Josh Hazlewood’s 22 wickets, including decisive powerplay bursts and death-overs control, turned tight games in RCB’s favour, while Krunal Pandya’s 17 wickets and late-order utility added balance.Jitesh Sharma and Romario Shepherd provided the finishing punch, delivering high-impact cameos in must-win situations. The abundance of match-winners across departments became the defining trait of RCB's campaign and the backbone of their climb to the title.The win also marked a shift in the side’s approach. After years of depending heavily on individual brilliance, RCB’s 2025 campaign was built on a collective effort, with contributions spread across departments. Their late-season surge, which carried them through the playoffs and into the final, highlighted that shift and has now become the base for their upcoming plans.The focus now shifts to building around the title-winning team. The retained core offers experience and consistency, while younger players who impressed in the previous season add depth.: Rs 16.4 crore: 8 (2 overseas)RCB, the defending champions, will have Rs 16.4 crore going into the auction, but they already have a settled playing eleven and would only look to solidify themselves by adding backups.",Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) won the IPL 2025 title.

As the 2026 Indian Premier League (IPL) approaches, Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) enter the new season with a decade’s worth of highs, lows, reinventions, heartbreaks, and historic moments behind them. Since their inception in 2013, SRH have built a reputation as one of the league’s most resilient and tactically sharp sides, known first for their world-class bowling core and, in recent years, for a fearless batting revolution that has rewritten IPL record books.Their journey through the seasons tells the story of a team constantly evolving, constantly fighting.SRH burst onto the scene in 2013 with a playoff finish and peaked in 2016, lifting their maiden IPL title under David Warner after a thrilling victory over Royal Challengers Bangalore, now Royal Challengers Bengaluru.What followed was an era of consistency, five straight playoff appearances from 2016 to 2020, including a runners-up finish in 2018. But the years after brought turbulence. Between 2021 and 2023, SRH endured some of their toughest campaigns, finishing in the bottom three each season.The turning point arrived in 2024, when Pat Cummins’s aggressive leadership and a revamped squad powered SRH to a spectacular resurgence.They shattered the all-time IPL score twice, dominated with an explosive top order, and reached the final, eventually finishing runners-up to Kolkata Knight Riders. The momentum faltered in 2025, a season marked by inconsistency, but SRH still clawed their way to a respectable 6th-place finish after a late surge.Now, heading into IPL 2026, the franchise stands at another crucial moment. With key retentions shaping the core and a blend of experience, youth, and firepower, SRH look ready to script their next chapter, one that aims to reclaim playoff stability and push once again for the title.Travis Head, Abhishek Sharma, Aniket Verma, B Smaran, Ishan Kishan, Heinrich Klaasen, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Harsh Dubey, Kamindu Mendis, Harshal Patel, Brydon Carse, Pat Cummins, Jaydev Unadkat, Eshan Malinga, Zeeshan AnsariAbhinav Manohar, Atharva Taide, Sachin Baby, Wiaan Mulder, Mohammed Shami, Smarjeet Singh, Rahul Chahar, Adam ZampaSRH will enter the auction with a purse of ₹25.5 crore and will look to strengthen their spin-bowling department.

Auction Details:





In a blockbuster trade ahead of IPL 2026, Chennai Super Kings (CSK) have acquired veteran Indian wicketkeeper-batter Sanju Samson from Rajasthan Royals (RR), while sending Men in Yellow legend Ravindra Jadeja and Sam Curran to RR. This move marks one of the biggest trade deals in IPL history.CSK Managing Director Kasi Viswanathan described the decision to part ways with Jadeja as one of the toughest the franchise has faced. “We felt the need for a top-order Indian batsman, and since not many Indian batsmen will be available at the auction, the trade window was the best option. Leaving Jaddu was extremely difficult given his contribution to CSK’s success over the years,” Viswanathan said in a video released by the team.Jadeja, who represented RR in 2008-09 and CSK from 2012 to 2025 (with brief stints at Kochi Tuskers Kerala and Gujarat Lions), leaves as CSK’s leading wicket-taker with 143 scalps in 186 matches and their highest run-getter in IPL history with 2,198 runs.CSK will have ₹43.4 crore left to spend at the IPL 2026 mega auction. They have 9 slots remaining to fill in the upcoming season. With the inclusion of Samson, their top order is settled, but they will look for middle-order batters and spinners in the auction, having let go of Jadeja and with Ashwin already retired.","Chennai Super Kings (CSK) have acquired veteran Indian wicketkeeper-batter Sanju Samson from Rajasthan Royals (RR), while sending Men in Yellow legend Ravindra Jadeja and Sam Curran to RR.

As the 2026 Indian Premier League (IPL) approaches, Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) enter another defining phase in their brief but eventful journey. Since joining the league in 2022, the franchise has experienced early playoff highs, difficult downturns, and seasons shaped by injuries, form slumps and constant rebuilding.Their campaigns have often revolved around sharp pace bowling, tactical flexibility and a core that mixed promising youth with seasoned performers. But the last season exposed significant gaps, especially in the fast-bowling group, forcing LSG back to the drawing board as they prepare for a crucial reset ahead of IPL 2026.In the previous campaign, Australia's Mitchell Marsh top scored for the the side with 627 runs in 13 matches - the joint-lowest in terms of matches played among the top 10 players with most runs last season. Surprisingly, no other player found room in the top 10, despite an explosive start from Nicholas Pooran, who ended the campaign on 524 in 14 games.Skipper Rishabh Pant , who was also the most expensive, ended the campaign with just 269 runs in 14 matches. He was brought to the side for a mammoth Rs 27 crore.LSG's bowlers were far from their best too, as no bowler found spot among the top 10 wicket takers. In fact, it was Digvesh Rathi who led the pack with 14 wickets from 13 matches.The franchise's focus will be on doing better in this department as they finalize their retentions and releases and head to the auction.LSG will go into the auction with a purse of Rs 22.9 crore, and they will look to buy an overseas pacer and backup spin-bowling all-rounders.

As the countdown to the 2026 Indian Premier League (IPL) begins, the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) arrive at the new season carrying one of the league’s most colourful and fluctuating histories, marked by iconic title wins, bold leadership calls, dramatic rebuilds and, most recently, a return to dominance.Since the league’s inception, KKR have embodied unpredictability and flair, evolving from an underperforming side in the early years to a powerhouse capable of producing match-winners across disciplines.Their transformation began with the Gautam Gambhir era, which delivered two IPL titles in 2012 and 2014, redefining the team’s culture around aggression, discipline and tactical clarity.The seasons that followed brought mixed fortunes, with playoff appearances sprinkled between rebuilding phases. From 2015 to 2020, KKR remained competitive but inconsistent, often hovering around the mid-table as they tried to rediscover their title-winning balance.A significant shift came with the emergence of a new leadership and coaching setup, laying the foundation for their remarkable 2024 campaign.That season, KKR’s powerful all-round squad, explosive batting line-up and sharp bowling attack propelled them to the IPL title, defeating Sunrisers Hyderabad in a commanding final, re-establishing the franchise as a top-tier force.The 2025 season, though filled with intense battles and flashes of brilliance, didn’t replicate the previous year’s highs. KKR experienced ups and downs throughout the tournament, but retained a strong core and continued developing young talent, finishing mid-table and setting the stage for another rebuild.Now, with IPL 2026 on the horizon, KKR enter a crucial phase. Their retention decisions reflect a balanced approach, backing proven match-winners while nurturing the next generation, as they aim to reclaim their crown and push for another deep title run.Ajinkya Rahane, Angkrish Raghuvanshi, Anukul Roy, Harshit Rana, Manish Pandey, Ramandeep Singh, Rinku Singh, Rovman Powell, Sunil Narine, Umran Malik, Vaibhav Arora, Varun ChakaravarthyAndre Russell, Venkatesh Iyer, Quinton de Kock, Moeen Ali, Anrich Nortje, Mayank Markande (traded out).KKR will have a lot of work to do at the auction and will be the busiest of all franchises.

Players Released by DC Ahead of IPL 2026 Auction







NEW DELHI: Delhi Capitals on Friday unveiled their retained and released player lists ahead of the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2026 auction, scheduled later this year. The franchise has retained 17 players from the squad that finished fifth last season.After internal reviews and discussions, the Capitals have released Mohit Sharma, Faf du Plessis, Sediqullah Atal, Jake Fraser-McGurk, Manvanth Kumar and Darshan Nalkande ahead of the upcoming edition.Core players retained include Axar Patel, KL Rahul, Kuldeep Yadav, Mitchell Starc and Tristan Stubbs. The squad has also been bolstered by the arrival of Nitish Rana, who joins DC in a trade that sees Donovan Ferreira move to Rajasthan Royals.Delhi finished fifth in IPL 2025 and failed to make it past the league stage, continuing a trend of inconsistency that has held the franchise back in recent years.With a talented squad and a history of occasional brilliance, DC will look to rebuild momentum and return to the playoffs in IPL 2026.In the 2025 season, Delhi Capitals played 14 matches, winning seven, losing six, and registering one no result. Their win percentage of 50.00% reflects a season where they showed sparks of promise but lacked the sustained dominance needed to secure a top-four finish.While the team delivered some commanding performances with both bat and ball, crucial moments in key matches cost them valuable points.A look at Delhi Capitals’ historical performance in the IPL provides a clearer picture of their fluctuating journey. The table of their year-wise standings shows a franchise with high peaks but equally deep troughs. DC made impressive runs in the early years, finishing as semi-finalists in 2008 and topping the league stage in 2009 before another semifinal exit. Their best phase came between 2019 and 2021, where they reached the playoffs twice and finished runners-up in 2020—their closest shot at a maiden IPL trophy.However, the table also reveals several disappointing seasons, particularly between 2013 and 2018, where they consistently finished in the bottom half, including last place in 2013, 2014 and 2018. Post-2021, the Capitals again slipped into inconsistency, finishing 5th, 9th and 6th between 2022 and 2024. The fifth-place finish in 2025 continued this pattern, showcasing a team capable of competing but unable to convert opportunities.Overall, the standings table highlights Delhi Capitals’ inconsistency: strong runs followed by sudden declines. Their runner-up finish in 2020 stands out as the franchise's best-ever campaign, but they have struggled to replicate that form since.Heading into IPL 2026, the Capitals will look to address these inconsistencies and build a squad capable of returning to playoff contention. With a fresh approach and renewed focus, Delhi will hope that the upcoming season marks the beginning of a stronger, more stable era.Delhi Capitals IPL 2026 Retentions: Complete Squad OverviewTristan StubbsSameer RizviKarun NairDonovan Ferreira (Trade)Nitish Rana (Trade – Rs 4.2 Cr)Jake Fraser-McGurkKL RahulAbhishek PorelALL-ROUNDERSAxar PatelAayush BadoniVicky OstwalMahipal LomrorTripuranha VijayAjay MandalManav SutharKuldeep YadavMitchell StarcMukesh KumarTushar DeshpandeT NatarajanDarshan NalkandeMohit SharmaRs 21.8 Cr8 (5 Overseas)Mohit SharmaFaf du PlessisSediqullah AtalJake Fraser-McGurkManvanth KumarDarshan NalkandeDonovan Ferreira (traded out)DC will enter the auction with Rs 21.8 crore.

AUCTION BUDGET:





As the 2026 Indian Premier League draws closer, Punjab Kings will look to bounce back from the heartbreak of the previous season and launch a renewed campaign for their maiden IPL trophy. Under the leadership of Shreyas Iyer, PBKS came agonisingly close in IPL 2025, falling just six runs short against Royal Challengers Bengaluru in a thrilling final. Despite the defeat, Punjab’s performance throughout the season reflected significant improvement and marked one of their strongest campaigns in recent years.In IPL 2025, Punjab Kings finished at the top of the points table, showcasing remarkable consistency. They won 10 of their 17 matches, with six losses and one no-result, registering an impressive win percentage of 63.64%. Their journey to the final included a confident victory over Mumbai Indians in Qualifier 2, reinforcing their status as one of the most balanced and competitive sides of the season.The 2025 squad featured a strong mix of experienced international stars and promising young Indian talent. Led by Shreyas Iyer, the squad included dynamic players like Glenn Maxwell, Marcus Stoinis, Josh Inglis and Marco Jansen, while homegrown talents such as Prabhsimran Singh, Arshdeep Singh, Harpreet Brar, Shashank Singh and Nehal Wadhera played pivotal roles.Rising names like Xavier Bartlett, Priyansh Arya, Musheer Khan and Suryansh Shedge added depth and energy to the lineup. This combination of youth and experience was one of the biggest strengths of PBKS in 2025.The franchise’s historical performance in the IPL highlights its inconsistent yet occasionally brilliant journey. As Kings XI Punjab, the team enjoyed strong seasons in 2008 and 2014, finishing as semi-finalists and runners-up respectively. However, they also endured several years at the bottom of the table. After rebranding to Punjab Kings in 2021, the team’s fortunes fluctuated but eventually surged in 2025 when they topped the league standings and finished as runners-up—signalling a resurgence under new leadership.The table of past seasons clearly reflects the team’s evolution: a mix of mid-table finishes, a few disappointing campaigns, and standout years where they looked like title contenders.

Drake Maye and the New England Patriots kept their win streak alive on Thursday night, pushing it to eight with a steady victory over the New York Jets. While Maye delivered another controlled performance on the field, it was his wife Ann who drew plenty of attention in the stands. Her outfit for the primetime matchup was far from her usual Patriots-themed style, which made fans even more curious as she revealed the story behind it.Maye threw for 281 yards, added a touchdown, and scrambled for 26 more as New England secured a 27-14 win against a struggling Jets team. The temperature at Gillette Stadium dropped into the low 40s, and that alone shaped Ann’s look. She has become a familiar presence at Patriots games, often going all-in on team colors, whether in bright red or deep New England blue. Her near-wardrobe mishap from a previous outing had already made headlines, and her growing popularity on social media, especially on her cooking TikTok, has only amplified the attention around her game-day fits.For the TNF game, Ann Maye ditched the Patriots palette and chose warmth over theme, telling fans in her TikTok video, “It’s cold, so we are working with what we got.” She followed it up with another candid line that fans immediately latched onto: “I know it’s brown and brown like has nothing to do with the Patriots, but I think it’s going to be really warm and I think it’s going to be a fun statement winter coat.”She showcased the look from the stadium, proving that practicality can still stand out. With New England now sitting at 9-2 and eyeing a playoff run that could stretch deep into January, staying warm will only get more important. Fans are already wondering what Ann might choose once true winter hits and the stakes rise even higher.Drake and Ann’s story has long been part of their charm. The couple met in middle school, both attended UNC, and even shared connections on the field through Ann’s brother Tad, who played quarterback with Maye. Their June 2025 wedding marked a new chapter, and today Ann stands as his strongest Patriots supporter, even when she leaves the team colors at home.","Drake Maye and the New England Patriots beat the New York Jets 27-14 on Thursday night.

Jack Hughes' injury puts Devils' momentum and Olympic hopes in spotlight



More NHL coverage

New Jersey Devils fans woke up to news they did not expect. Star forward Jack Hughes is out with a “non-hockey” hand injury, the team confirmed on Friday, Nov. 14. The announcement caught everyone by surprise because Hughes has been one of the brightest players in the league this season and a major reason behind New Jersey’s strong start. The team said he was still being evaluated and that “more details would be provided when they become available,” leaving the situation open to worry and speculation.Reports soon painted a clearer, yet stranger, picture. According to Sportsnet insider Elliotte Friedman, the injury happened during a team dinner on Thursday night. ESPN called it a “freak accident,” and early information suggests Hughes slipped and cut his hand. It may sound small, but the cut is serious enough to keep him out for at least one game. As odd as it seems, the dinner reportedly included Barstool Sports personality Frank “The Tank” Fleming, based on a social media post. That twist only added to the buzz around the incident.The timing of the Jack Hughes injury could not be more frustrating for New Jersey. Hughes has been electric this season, producing a team-high 10 goals and 20 points in 17 games for the Eastern Conference leaders.It is the strong comeback the team hoped for after he needed season-ending shoulder surgery last March. That injury came after he crashed into the boards, ending what had already been a disrupted stretch in which he missed 20 games in each of the previous two seasons.At 24, Hughes is entering his prime, and his play reflects that. He posted a team-record 99 points in 2022-23 and is widely considered a lock for Team USA’s Olympic roster. Any setback now raises questions not just for the Devils but also for his international plans. If the cut is deep or slow to heal, it could shift timelines the team had counted on.For now, the Devils and their fans must wait. The situation may have started as a rare accident at dinner, but its impact could linger far longer than the moment it happened.","New Jersey Devils forward Jack Hughes is out with a ‘non-hockey’ hand injury.

NHL news

The Chicago Blackhawks walked away from their overtime loss to the New Jersey Devils with more than a single point. They walked away with another reminder that Connor Bedard is growing into something rare. Even in a game where Chicago gave up three separate one-goal leads, Bedard still found a way to shape the night. His early strike set the tone and kept the Blackhawks in a fight they were never fully out of. On a roster missing Frank Nazar, Jason Dickinson, and Andre Burakovsky, his presence mattered even more.Spencer Knight also played a key role, turning away chance after chance to keep Chicago steady. But it was Bedard who delivered the first spark. He opened the scoring on a well-earned 5-on-3 advantage created through persistence, smart puck movement, and hard work along the boards. A sharp give-and-go with Teuvo Teravainen pulled Jacob Markstrom out of position long enough for Bedard to finish. It was another example of how quickly he can change a game.That goal pushed Bedard to four straight games with a goal and nine straight with at least one point. With 26 points, he now sits tied for second in league scoring alongside Leo Carlsson and Macklin Celebrini.His rise has caught national attention, but it was a comment on TNT that carried the most weight.""He's been absolutely spectacular."" Wayne Gretzky said of Bedard. ""It's such a pleasure to see because coming into this league at 18, you [have] all this pressure on you, you [have] all of this focus on you, you're not a very good team, you're a young team, you're rebuilding. He was front and center; he didn't back away from anybody or shy away from the media. For him to work as hard as he did in the off-season to come in and play at the level he's playing at now, he's earning his way onto Team Canada. ""When The Great One speaks that strongly, people listen. Gretzky went out of his way to mention Team Canada, suggesting he believes Bedard not only belongs but is carving out a clear path. With the pace he is setting, leaving him off would feel impossible.Gretzky later compared Bedard’s scoring play to a Larry Bird no-look pass, a nod to the creativity behind the goal. More eyes will be on him soon as Chicago heads into a Hockey Night in Canada matchup with the Toronto Maple Leafs, and the praise is only expected to grow.","Wayne Gretzky says Connor Bedard is ""absolutely spectacular"" Bedard has scored in four straight games and has nine in a row with at least one point.

NHL Trade Rumors: Could GM Stan Bowman push Edmonton Oilers toward a Juuse Saros deal?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/nhl-trade-rumors-could-gm-stan-bowman-push-edmonton-oilers-toward-a-juuse-saros-deal/articleshow/125333517.cms,"Could GM Stan Bowman push Edmonton Oilers toward a Juuse Saros deal? (Image Via Twitter)

Can Edmonton Oilers actually convince the Nashville Predators to trade Juuse Saros?

“Absolutely Dynamic”: 55 Minutes of Juuse Saros Saves





At the beginning of their season, the goaltending dilemma at the Edmonton Oilers turned out to be their most important story, particularly after the humiliating 9-1 loss to the Colorado Avalanche. That loss led fans and analysts to push for GM Stan Bowman to take action immediately, and now he is under a lot of pressure to consider upgrading the goaltender position. Stuart Skinner has managed to perform better recently, and so he has received some support, but the conversation concerning if Juuse Saros could be the long-term answer still reigns in the league discussions.Interest in Saros rose when Jeff Marek first floated his name as a possible target, then insiders like Allan Mitchell and Mark Spector followed up with more detailed analyses. The biggest problem is clear: Edmonton is very close to the salary cap limit, has almost no tradable players, and Saros has only just begun the first year of an eight-year contract that carries a full no-movement clause. This situation makes any trade incredibly difficult, despite the fact that most people think that Saros would quickly bring stability to the Oilers’ most vulnerable area.The first question is whether Nashville wants to discuss things.Until now, the insider's view of the situation is that the Predators are not interested in trading Juuse Saros. Allan Mitchell mentioned that any trade would see the Nashville team retaining some salary, and allowing it to take back several players, whereas, in the case of Skinner, Frank Seravalli was not sure if Saros’ recent performance could be considered an upgrade over Skinner.The Pittsburgh Penguins, meanwhile, are figuring out how their narrative is changing. Insiders, like Josh Yohe, are saying that after the team’s surprisingly good start, players like Erik Karlsson, Rickard Rakell, and Bryan Rust are no longer going to be trade candidates — at least not as long as the team stays in the playoffs. GM Kyle Dubas will not be chasing risky rentals or sacrificing future assets, which implies he is adopting a more conservative approach compared to the previous seasons.The Oilers can only have Juuse Saros in their dreams for the moment, as all indications are that this trade is unlikely to happen — at least for now. Nashville wants to keep its goalie, and Edmonton has no room under the cap, making it more probable that the latter's next step will be aiming at a backup strengthening rather than going for a spectacular blockbuster trade.More coverage on NHL","Edmonton Oilers are under a lot of pressure to consider upgrading the goaltender position.
