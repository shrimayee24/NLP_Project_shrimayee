Gujarat Titans crashed out of IPL 2025 after losing to Mumbai Indians by 20 runs in the Eliminator match at Maharaja Yadavindra Singh International Cricket Stadium in Mullanpur. The defeat triggered emotional responses from players' families in the stands, including head coach Ashish Nehra's son and captain Shubman Gill 's sister Shahneel, who were seen crying after the match.The loss marked Gujarat Titans' third consecutive defeat, following setbacks against Lucknow Super Giants and Chennai Super Kings in their final league-stage matches. Despite leading the table for most of the league stage, these losses pushed them into the Eliminator against Mumbai Indians.Mumbai Indians, led by Hardik Pandya, won the toss and chose to bat. The decision proved successful as they posted a formidable total of 228/5 in their 20 overs.Rohit Sharma and Jonny Bairstow provided Mumbai Indians with a strong start, forming an opening partnership of 84 runs. Bairstow, who joined as a replacement player for Ryan Rickelton, contributed 47 runs before being dismissed by Sai Kishore.Gujarat Titans' fielding lapses proved costly as they dropped two crucial catches of Rohit Sharma, with both Gerald Coetzee and Kusal Mendis failing to hold onto relatively straightforward opportunities.Rohit Sharma capitalised on these reprieves, scoring 81 runs off 50 deliveries, including 9 fours and 4 sixes, helping Mumbai Indians set a challenging target.In response, Gujarat Titans' chase suffered an early setback when captain Shubman Gill was dismissed in the first over. Sai Sudharsan (80) and Washington Sundar (48) mounted a resistance, but their efforts fell short against the disciplined bowling of Jasprit Bumrah and Trent Boult in the crucial final overs.The defeat's emotional impact was evident in the stands as Ashish Nehra's son was seen crying inconsolably after the final ball. Others attempted to console him as the reality of elimination set in.Similar scenes unfolded elsewhere in the stadium as Shubman Gill's sister Shahneel was also overcome with emotion and required consolation from fellow spectators.The victory advanced Mumbai Indians to Qualifier 2, where they will face Punjab Kings at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad on Sunday, June 1.The result marked a disappointing end for Gujarat Titans, who had shown promising form throughout the league stage of IPL 2025 before their late-season decline resulted in elimination.","Gujarat Titans crashed out of IPL 2025 after losing to Mumbai Indians by 20 runs in the Eliminator match.

Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce have mostly kept their date nights private after the drama that unfolded at Super Bowl LIX but the pop star also ended up the American Music Awards which has shocked fans. While Taylor Swift has remained silent on her absence, it seems like the reason is finally out in the open.Recently, as per Daily Mail, a source has revealed that, “She avoided the AMAs because she didn’t want to deal with 1000’s of questions about the Blake Lively saga.”The source also added, “it is all anyone wants to talk about and Taylor is really tired of it,"" and that she's eager ""to move on and she does not want to keep dealing with it.""While Taylor Swift has not confirmed these speculations around her absence at the popular and prestigious American Music Awards, fans were furious as many felt the AMAs were “unfair” to the pop sensation.A fan took to X and wrote, “If the @AMAs muting the crowd cheering for Taylor during the category announcements isn’t proof that these wins were heavily manipulated, I don’t know what is.""Another fan wrote, “Definitely rigged or manipulated in some way, you can’t tell me it’s not.

NEW DELHI: Mumbai Indians held their nerve better in a pressure-cooker Eliminator to outclass Gujarat Titans by 20 runs in a high-scoring IPL 2025 clash on Friday. Rohit Sharma (81 off 50) capitalised on early chances to play a pivotal knock, while Jonny Bairstow (47 off 22) made an instant impact on debut, powering MI to a commanding 228 for five in their 20 overs.After sealing a place in Qualifier 2, Player of the Match Rohit Sharma expressed pride in his side's all-round effort.""I have got only four fifties. Would have loved to score more fifties. Good day for us as a team. I do understand the importance of playing this Eliminator and going through this and taking the next step forward. Really proud of a complete team effort,"" Rohit said at the post-match presentation.""When I play the game, I try to do my best keeping everything aside. Making sure how I can do the job for the team. I had to make the most of the luck. I am glad I could do that. Get the team into a good position. It was going to be challenging with the dew coming. The bowlers held their nerves really well. To be honest, I have played those shots before in the tournament and found fielders.""Somewhere down the line you got to be lucky and today was that day for me. I got lucky as those catches were dropped.But even after that you got to play. I was focussing on keeping the momentum and tempo going. Was a good bowling effort.

The winner will meet Royal Challengers Bengaluru in the IPL 2025 final on June 3.Gujarat Titans, despite being erratic in the field and with the ball, managed to stay in the hunt thanks to a masterful knock from Sai Sudharsan (80 off 49), but eventually fell short at 208 for six, bowing out of the tournament.Ultimately, it was Mumbai who won the crucial moments to stay alive in the playoffs. Despite the heavy dew, chasing down such a mammoth total in a knockout match demanded something extraordinary — and Sudharsan nearly delivered just that before his dismissal in the 16th over tilted the contest.Bumrah’s trademark yorker accounted for Washington Sundar (48 off 24), and Richard Gleeson struck the decisive blow by dismantling Sudharsan’s stumps when the left-hander missed a scoop, turning the tide in MI’s favour.While he was at the crease, Sudharsan’s strokeplay was a sight to behold. In a match dominated by brute power, the elegant left-hander stood out, threading gaps with surgical precision and timing.With the equation down to 36 off 12 balls, and left-handers Rahul Tewatia and Sherfane Rutherford at the crease, MI debutant Gleeson was handed the final over with 24 runs needed.

Fernandes, who is currently 30 years old, scored 19 goals last season and is United’s key player. Al Hilal’s big money could tempt United to sell him to fix their finances. The club thinks every player has a price, but losing Fernandes could hurt their plans to rebuild the team.

Fans are worried but hope their captain will stay to help United get better.Manchester United’s money problems are serious, but selling Fernandes could cause trouble.

Travis Hunter and his wife, Leanna Lenee, have been through a lot and now, former NFL star Cam Newton has weighed in on the controversy that Hunter has been facing.

Jonathan Toews is back: Why the Blackhawks legend wants another shot



Why the Maple Leafs are a rumored landing spot







It’s the NHL comeback story fans didn’t know they were waiting for. Jonathan Toews — the three-time Stanley Cup champion, longtime Chicago Blackhawks captain, and one of the most respected leaders in hockey has officially signaled he’s ready to return to the ice. After two seasons away battling health issues, Toews is back in the conversation, and yes, the Toronto Maple Leafs are reportedly one of the teams on his radar. With free agency approaching on July 1, this is suddenly a headline-grabbing moment for Leafs fans and hockey followers across the league.After a decorated career in Chicago, Toews stepped away in 2023, citing struggles with Chronic Immune Response Syndrome and long COVID. It was unclear if the 36-year-old would ever lace up his skates again at the NHL level. But now, according to his agent Pat Brisson, Toews has made it clear: he’s fully committed to a return for the 2025–26 season.Brisson says he will begin taking calls from interested teams as free agency opens. That’s big news not just because Toews is a marquee name but because his return symbolizes an unfinished business on the ice.So why is Toronto even in this conversation? For starters, the Leafs need depth.With a superstar-heavy top six, the team’s bottom lines have often been where playoff series are won or lost. Adding a veteran like Toews, someone who’s been in the trenches, lifted the Cup three times, and knows how to lead in high-pressure moments could be exactly the glue Toronto’s locker room needs.It’s also worth noting that Toews wouldn’t come in as a high-scoring savior. His 2022–23 season (15 goals, 31 points) showed he’s no longer at his offensive peak, but what he brings in leadership, defensive awareness, and faceoff skill is still highly valuable. Media analysts note that Toews could be the kind of low-risk, high-upside signing that pays off in the playoffs, especially for a team desperate to break through.Also read - Winnipeg Jets lose captain Adam Lowry to hip surgery, recovery set for half a year","Chicago Blackhawks captain Jonathan Toews has officially signaled he’s ready to return to the ice.

Bryce Harper’s elbow injury: Latest updates

Phillies' strategy and Harper's impact





Philadelphia Phillies fans really want to know if their favorite player, Bryce Harper, will play tonight against the Milwaukee Brewers. The game starts at 6:45 p.m. ET at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia. Harper got hurt a few days ago, and everyone’s wondering if he’ll be back for this important game. The Phillies are doing great this season, and Harper is a big part of that. Fans can watch the game on MLB Network, NBCS-PH, or FDSWI.In Tuesday's game against the Braves, Harper was hit with a blister-fast pitch on the right elbow. Hurting very much, he had to leave the game before it ended. The news was good: X-rays showed nothing broken inside the elbow area, greatly pleasing the team and its fans. Phillies manager Rob Thomson stated that Harper's elbow remained swollen and sore through Thursday, so he was out of the lineup for the day. The club is being more cautious outright, considering Harper underwent surgery on that elbow in 2022.Yesterday, Harper's elbow started feeling better, with less swelling, but he hasn’t tried hitting a ball yet. The Phillies will decide if he can play tonight just before the game at 6:45 p.m.ET. If Harper can’t play, other players like Edmundo Sosa or Alec Bohm will take his spot. Bohm might play first base. The team hopes Harper will be back soon and won’t miss too many games. They want him to be completely healthy before he plays again.Also Read: A.J. Smith-Shawver injury update: When will the Braves rookie pitcher return after manager Brian Snitker says ""doesn't look good"" The Phillies are having an awesome season, winning 34 out of 53 games so far. They've won nine of their last ten games before playing the Brewers. Harper helps a lot, hitting .267 with eight home runs and 33 RBIs this year. If he can’t play, it might make things harder against the Brewers, who have good pitchers. Manager Rob Thomson says the team is ready, with players like J.T. Realmuto and Max Kepler able to help.Harper is tough and has come back from injuries before, like after his elbow surgery in 2023. His hitting and energy are super important for big games like tonight at Citizens Bank Park. To avoid injuries in the playoffs, the Phillies likely won’t use Harper if there is any cause for concern. The game will start airing at 6:45 p.m.","Bryce Harper was hit with a blister-fast pitch on the right elbow on Tuesday. X-rays showed nothing broken inside the elbow area.

NEW DELHI: Royal Challengers Bengaluru stormed into their first Indian Premier League final since 2016 with a comprehensive eight-wicket win over Punjab Kings in a lopsided Qualifier 1 on Thursday. Punjab’s ultra-aggressive approach proved costly as the home side was skittled out for just 101 in 14.1 overs.

India Test squad vs England: Ajit Agarkar full press conference





NEW DELHI: India’s batting mainstays Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma, along with ace spinner Ravichandran Ashwin, have retired from Test cricket, while star pacer Mohammed Shami will miss the crucial five-match series in England due to fitness issues.All eyes are now on the Shubman Gill-led Indian side, widely regarded as one of the most inexperienced teams to tour England in recent memory.In the absence of Kohli and Rohit, India's batting line-up appears quite thin in experience. So, could the selectors consider recalling experienced campaigners like Cheteshwar Pujara or Ajinkya Rahane , who are yet to retire from the traditional format, to strengthen the top order?During a recent interview, Pujara was asked whether Gautam Gambhir had reached out to him regarding the England tour.""No, not yet,"" Pujara told Lallantop when asked, ""Have you received a phone call from Gambhir yet?""Also See: MI vs GT IPL Live Score The 103-Test veteran expressed his readiness to return if given the opportunity.""I am ready. I don't know if they will take me or not. But if I get a chance, yes, it will be an honour to represent the country again. As a cricketer, you always feel that as long as you are fit, as long as you are contributing, and if I have a good performance in domestic cricket, and I am preparing well, if I get a chance, yes, I will be more than happy to be part of the team,"" Pujara said. Shubman Gill has been handed the responsibility of leading the Indian Test team through a “massive transition” period, with the dynamic Rishabh Pant appointed as his deputy for what is expected to be a stern challenge in English conditions.At just 25, Gill becomes India’s fifth youngest Test captain, following in the footsteps of Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi (21), Sachin Tendulkar (23), Kapil Dev (24), and Ravi Shastri (25). The first Test against England is scheduled to begin on June 20 in Leeds.""Last year or so we have looked at Shubman (for leadership). We are hopeful he is the guy who is going (to take the team forward). It is a high pressure job but he is a terrific player. We wish him all the best,"" said chief selector Ajit Agarkar after announcing the 18-member squad, which included no major surprises.Explaining Pant’s appointment as vice-captain, Agarkar added: ""Pant is one of our best batters in Test cricket over the last four-five years. A wicketkeeper can see the game well and that's why he is Shubman's deputy.""The squad also features maiden Test call-ups for promising left-hander B Sai Sudharsan and left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh.","Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma and Ravichandran Ashwin have retired from Test cricket.

'I don't want to be a one-season wonder': Punjab Kings' Shashank Singh





NEW DELHI: After Mumbai Indians posted a daunting total in a crucial knockout clash, Gujarat Titans would have banked on a solid start from openers Shubman Gill and Sai Sudharsan to lay the foundation for the massive chase. However, their hopes were dashed early as skipper Shubman Gill was dismissed in the very first over by MI’s strike bowler Trent Boult , delivering a significant early setback.Boult got the ball to swing in late and at pace. Pitching full on middle and leg, the delivery tempted Gill into a pre-determined hoick across the line. He missed it completely, and the ball crashed into his pads. The umpire raised his finger immediately.Hardik Pandya roared in celebration, as did Boult and the rest of the MI camp. Gill reviewed the decision, but the replays didn’t favor him, and he walked back disappointed.Following his dismissal, fans took to social media and started trolling the Gujarat Titans skipper.Earlier, Rohit Sharma capitalised on some early luck to craft a stroke-filled 81, while Jonny Bairstow made an immediate impact on his MI debut, propelling the five-time champions to a formidable 228/5 against a sloppy Gujarat Titans outfit in the IPL Eliminator.With a surface offering less grass than the one used for Qualifier 1, Mumbai chose to bat first — and their decision paid off.Gujarat Titans were listless in the field, dropping three crucial catches — two of Rohit (81 off 50) and one of Suryakumar Yadav (33 off 20) — and offered little control with the ball.Rohit, the former captain, was dropped twice during the powerplay — first by Gerald Coetzee in the deep, and then by Kusal Mendis, who had a forgettable GT debut after fumbling a straightforward take behind the stumps off Mohammed Siraj.It was Bairstow (47 off 22) who set the tone, unleashing a flurry of boundaries to give Mumbai Indians the early momentum in the powerplay. The England batter, returning to the IPL after not featuring regularly in recent seasons, carried his county form into the game, having recently hit back-to-back fifties for Yorkshire.This marked the third straight match in which Gujarat Titans conceded a total in excess of 225 — a worrying trend for the 2022 champions.",Mumbai Indians beat Gujarat Titans by eight wickets in IPL Eliminator.

Poll Can Gujarat Titans overcome Buttler’s absence in the Eliminator? Yes, Mendis can rise to the occasion No, Buttler’s impact will be hard to replace

Josh Hazlewood - we picked up momentum from Jitesh’s knock in Lucknow





The Gujarat Titans will take the field in the IPL 2025 Eliminator without one of their most reliable stars—Jos Buttler, who has returned to England for international duty.Buttler’s absence, though expected, comes as a big blow. He was central to Gujarat’s top-order dominance this season, forming a formidable trio with Shubman Gill and Sai Sudharsan. Across key matches, his ability to accelerate in the middle overs and finish games gave GT much-needed stability and aggression.With England’s summer fixtures beginning in early June, Buttler has flown back to join national camp, a development that GT had been preparing for. In his place, Sri Lankan wicketkeeper-batter Kusal Mendis has been brought into the XI. Mendis, though yet to feature prominently this season, brings international experience and strokeplay that could serve Gujarat well on an unfamiliar surface in Mullanpur.GT's warm-up sessions reflected this change—Anuj Rawat kept to the bowlers, while Kumar Kushagra, also in gloves, stood behind Rawat, suggesting a shift in roles. Correspondents on ground noted that Kusal Mendis was not sighted during warm-ups, but he is confirmed in the squad as Buttler’s replacement.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? GT will hope Mendis can slot in seamlessly, though replacing a player of Buttler’s calibre in a high-pressure knockout game is no easy task.Alongside the absence of Kagiso Rabada , who has also left for South Africa duty, Gujarat’s depth will be tested. All eyes will now be on how Shubman Gill’s men adapt to these changes against a resurgent Mumbai Indians unit.","Jos Buttler has returned to England for international duty.

Blending persona and personal values

Rey Mysterio reacts with pride





WWE Intercontinental Champion Dominik Mysterio has unveiled a striking new chest tattoo that pays tribute to his father, lucha libre legend Rey Mysterio. Shared via his Instagram Story after this week’s episode of Monday Night RAW, the ink represents more than just body art — it marks a deeper connection between the Mysterio family legacy and cultural symbolism.The tattoo, featuring skeletal-style wings under his collarbone, closely resembles the winged design that appears on Rey Mysterio’s iconic wrestling masks. It is also placed in the same location where Rey sports a chest tattoo with similar Aztec-style features, blending visual heritage with family homage.Known for his “Dirty Dom” persona, Dominik’s new tattoo appears to contrast sharply with his heel character in WWE storylines. While his on-screen behavior often involves taunting his father and generating crowd heat, this personal gesture reveals a more respectful and introspective side.The five-hour tattoo session resulted in a design that aligns with both wrestling history and Mexican tradition. In Aztec culture, eagle wings hold sacred meaning, symbolizing power, protection, and a spiritual warrior’s strength. This deeper message suggests Dominik may be embracing the cultural roots his father has long celebrated through his career.Despite their on-screen rivalry, Rey Mysterio has expressed pride in his son’s accomplishments. Speaking at the WrestleMania After Dark party in Las Vegas, Rey said, “As a father, that would give me the biggest sense of pride to see him as IC Champion… I would love nothing more than to step in and challenge him and see if he really has what it takes to beat his dad.”Rey is currently recovering from a groin injury suffered just before WrestleMania 41, while Dominik continues to build his reign as Intercontinental Champion.Speaking on the Intoxicados podcast , Dominik said he is focused on becoming a Grand Slam Champion in WWE. “Right now, I want to continue being the greatest Intercontinental Champion of all time… Hollywood, I’m sure one day, but as of right now, I’m definitely focused on putting the Mysterio name and Guerrero name on my back.”With personal tributes and professional ambition intertwining, Dominik Mysterio seems poised to carry his family’s legacy into a new chapter - inside and possibly beyond the wrestling ring.","WWE Intercontinental Champion Dominik Mysterio has unveiled a striking new chest tattoo that pays tribute to his father, lucha libre legend Rey Mysterio.

The stage was set, the stakes high, and Rohit Sharma delivered a vintage performance when it mattered most. In the IPL 2025 Eliminator against Gujarat Titans at the Mullanpur Stadium, the Mumbai Indians stalwart smashed a timely half-century, reaching two historic milestones in the process — 7000 IPL runs and 300 sixes.Rohit opened alongside Jonny Bairstow and got MI off to a dream start. The pair added 79 runs in the powerplay without loss, attacking Gujarat’s bowlers with calculated aggression. Rohit, in particular, looked sharp from the outset, mixing timing with power in an authoritative knock.The Gujarat Titans, already missing Jos Buttler and Kagiso Rabada, were left ruing their mistakes in the field. Rohit was given two lives — both dropped catches — which proved costly as he went on to complete a fluent fifty.The experienced opener showed poise and control, anchoring the innings while continuing to find boundaries with ease.The toss went MI’s way as Hardik Pandya elected to bat first, citing scoreboard pressure and a dry surface at Mullanpur.

Poll Should Gujarat Titans invest in more young players like Sai Sudharsan? Yes, youth is the future! No, experience is key.





In a night where records tumbled at the Maharaja Yadavindra Singh International Cricket Stadium, Gujarat Titans' Sai Sudharsan etched his name into history books by becoming the youngest ever to score 700 runs in a single IPL season. The 23-year-old southpaw achieved the milestone during GT’s steep run-chase of 229 against Mumbai Indians in the IPL 2025 Eliminator on Friday.While the match largely tilted in MI’s favour—with Rohit Sharma (81) and debutant Jonny Bairstow (47) powering the five-time champions to a daunting 228/5—it was Sudharsan’s calm amidst the chaos that gave GT hope. Sudharsan opened the innings with Shubman Gill , but the Titans suffered a blow when Gill fell to Trent Boult in the very first over.Sudharsan, however, stood tall amid the wreckage. He raised his half-century off just 28 balls, showcasing fluency and composure. With crisp timing and smart placement, he attempted to keep GT in the contest against an MI attack high on confidence.Earlier in the match, Sudharsan had also contributed in the field with a brilliant diving effort to dismiss Bairstow, juggling the catch into the air for Coetzee to complete. It was a rare fielding highlight in an otherwise forgettable night for GT, who dropped Rohit Sharma twice before he went on to punish them with a commanding 81.Reaching the 700-run milestone in what is only his second full IPL season, Sai joins an elite club of prolific scorers. His maturity and shot selection under pressure stood out in a crunch game where others around him faltered.Even as Gujarat’s campaign teetered under MI’s scoreboard pressure, Sai Sudharsan’s rise remained a bright spark in an otherwise disappointing night for the Titans.

The real reason behind Jalen Ramsey trade deadlock







The Miami Dolphins and Jalen Ramsey saga is quickly turning into one of the most talked-about stories in the NFL. Once a key player in Miami’s defense, Ramsey now faces a turning point. His relationship with the team has become strained, and his big contract is making a trade complicated. But is Miami holding back only because of the money, or is there more to this situation that fans and experts haven’t figured out yet?Jalen Ramsey’s time in Miami is undeniably strained. Rumors swirl that his locker room relationships have soured, and the Dolphins appear ready to move on. Yet, the real obstacle isn’t just about player dynamics, it’s about the massive financial burden Ramsey’s contract places on Miami’s salary cap. The Dolphins are clear: they want to trade Ramsey but refuse to shoulder much of his guaranteed money, creating a complicated dance with potential suitors.ESPN insider Jeremy Fowler shed light on the hold-up, emphasizing that while interest in Ramsey is high, teams are wary of taking on the full financial weight of his deal. This isn’t just a minor negotiation; it’s a power play over millions in guaranteed cash. Miami’s strategy is to wait until after June 1, a date when the NFL’s salary cap rules allow them to free up significant cap space by moving Ramsey.This waiting game has frustrated many, as it delays the inevitable.A dam Schefter’s reports underline this growing impatience, noting that a trade announcement could come as soon as June but won’t be processed until the post-June 1 window opens. Meanwhile, Dolphins coach Mike McDaniel keeps a tight lip on the matter, focusing publicly on the current roster and refusing to elaborate on Ramsey’s uncertain future.Amid all this, Ramsey himself took to social media, trying to defuse fan backlash and clarify his mindset. His message was a rare glimpse into his perspective, he hasn’t lost respect for the cities and fans he’s played for, but he’s clearly ready to turn the page.Also Read: Pittsburgh Steelers risk 2025 season by choosing rookie Will Howard over Aaron Rodgers Whatever happens next, Jalen Ramsey’s Miami chapter is closing amid controversy and financial chess, setting the stage for a high-stakes move that could redefine both the player’s career and the Dolphins’ future defense.

The footage, which quickly spread across social media, has fueled intense speculation over the nature of the substance — with many users suspecting it to be “pink cocaine,” though there is no confirmation of that claim.In the viral video, Stefon Diggs is seen chatting casually with three women who reportedly referred to him as “Daddy” before he passed around the bag of pink material. “Yikes: NFL fans are speculating that Stefon Diggs handed these three girls what looks to be pink c*caine after he asked them to call him Daddy,” one user wrote on X (formerly Twitter). Others followed suit with similar reactions, suggesting Diggs was “serving pink cocaine” and even labeling him “a football player, pimp and a drug dealer. ”Despite the wave of viral commentary, there is currently no official evidence confirming that the substance was illicit. Still, the video has created a media storm, putting both Diggs and the Patriots in a difficult position during the offseason.When asked about the situation, Patriots head coach Mike Vrabel addressed the controversy during a media session ahead of an optional team practice, which Diggs did not attend.“It’s something that we’re aware of. Obviously, we want to make great decisions on and off the field,” Vrabel said. He added that his discussions with Diggs “will remain between him I and the club.”The NFL has chosen not to comment on the situation at this time, with a league spokesperson telling the Associated Press there would be no statement regarding the video.Also Read: T.J.

Cardi B, who filed for divorce from rapper Offset last year, was reportedly also on the boat during the controversial outing.As the video continues to circulate online, all eyes are on the NFL and Diggs’ camp for an official response.","New England Patriots wide receiver Stefon Diggs is back in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons.

'I don't want to be a one-season wonder': Punjab Kings' Shashank Singh





A dramatic hit-wicket dismissal to Kusal Mendis stole the spotlight in Mullanpur as Mumbai Indians edged Gujarat Titans by 20 runs in a record-breaking IPL 2025 Eliminator that saw a staggering 436 runs scored—the most in any IPL playoff.Chasing MI’s daunting 228/5, GT’s early hopes were pinned on Mendis and Sai Sudharsan after Shubman Gill fell cheaply. The Sri Lankan looked in rhythm, hammering two sixes and a four in a brief 10-ball stay. But just as the 64-run stand with Sudharsan was blossoming, chaos struck.Facing Mitchell Santner , Mendis lost his balance attempting a forceful stroke and accidentally trod onto his stumps, getting out hit wicket for 20. The moment was surreal—GT were 67/2 in 6.2 overs and cruising—until that lapse shifted the game’s tone.Sai Sudharsan continued valiantly with his sixth fifty of the season, while Washington Sundar’s 48 kept GT in touch. But with wickets falling at regular intervals, and Sudharsan bowled in the 16th over, GT’s chase slowly unravelled.MI’s bowlers held their nerve in the death overs despite heavy dew. Debutant Richard Gleeson delivered under pressure, while Ashwani Kumar closed out the match with 24 required off the final over.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? Earlier, Rohit Sharma ’s elegant 81 and Jonny Bairstow’s explosive 47 on debut powered MI to their imposing total.

It was a night that saw Mumbai Indians flex their championship mettle once again. In a record-breaking IPL Eliminator in Mullanpur — where both teams combined for a staggering 436 runs, the highest ever in playoff history — MI held their nerve to beat Gujarat Titans by 20 runs and march into Qualifier 2.While the scoreboard lit up with sixes and boundaries, it was Mumbai’s ability to win the clutch moments that stood out. Skipper Hardik Pandya , facing his former franchise in a high-pressure knockout, was full of praise for his team’s temperament and timing.“At one point of time the game was even-stevens,” Pandya said after the win. “I thought the wicket got better in the second innings. It started to come on well, they got into rhythm and we realised we need to hold our nerves and back our boys.”He singled out Jonny Bairstow’s explosive debut knock and Rohit Sharma ’s composed 81 as pivotal. “The way Jonny batted and started... for him to make his debut for us, it's a special franchise, coming in and playing the way he played. The way Ro batted — he took his time and once he got into rhythm, it was beautiful.”Pandya also praised his bowling unit, particularly Richard Gleeson’s final over under injury duress and Jasprit Bumrah ’s clinical spell.“The way Gleeson bowled. Jassi being Jassi. Ashwani... everyone chipped in well and we held our nerves. I would've liked couple more (big hits). The little margins help. We wanted to push in batting and I think we were able to do that.”Asked when he decides to bowl Bumrah, Pandya smiled: “It's very simple. Whenever you think the game is going away, just bring him. When you have that it's a luxury. It's like Mumbai housing prices – he's that expensive.”The final overs were tense, but Pandya had it planned. “I was just watching the scoreboard and I thought if we can keep extra runs at the end, I had the bowlers to bowl it. It was important that Jassi comes and bowls that over so that the margin becomes longer (the 18th over). Very important to recover well. Looking forward to the next game.”With this victory, Mumbai Indians set up a Qualifier 2 clash against Punjab Kings in Ahmedabad on June 1.

He spoke about who he believes was the best defender and the rivalry between him and Scottie Pippen was developed. On the All The Smoke Podcast, he speaks up.He saidFurther he says,“Let me tell you how Mark Jackson changed the game, because he saw a guy named Steph Curry, and a guy by the name Clay Thomson, and Mark Jackson as a coach made it acceptable for Steph Curry and Clay to shoot from that range, people shot from the range, but people didn’t do it as part of their offensive scheme.”Much talked about rivalries were shaped by good games and brilliant results, that made the player focus on different aspects of the game. In an interview, Thomas opens about his rivalry with Scottie Pippen, despite the mutual respect they had for each other. Regarding who he believed were the best defender, Thomas named Dennis Rodman and Scottie Pippen. He said:“As a defender, he doesn’t get enough credit, when we talk about the greatest and best defenders that have ever played in the NBA, Chicago had two of them — Rodman and Scottie Pippen, Scottie was different, At his best, I may have to say that he and Rodman were the one-two best defenders to ever play the game.

Paul George on If Tyrese Haliburton Has Reached Superstar Status





The Indiana Pacers are inches closer to what could be a historic return to the NBA Finals. Now, all eyes are on their young star Tyrese Haliburton. While Indiana stumbled in Game 5 against the New York Knicks, the spotlight remains firmly on Haliburton. Philadelphia 76ers star Paul George recently delivered high praise, calling Haliburton “the face of the NBA” while asserting that Haliburton is reaching superstardom.In his recent podcast Podcast P with Paul George, Philadelphia 76ers star Paul George didn’t hold back when discussing Haliburton’s emergence as a league leader.“He's the face of the NBA,” George declared. “I've heard a lot of people critique Tyrese Haliburton. Some of it's fair, some of it's a stretch… This is his coming out party. He’s established now. This is what we expect from him on a nightly basis.”George acknowledged Haliburton’s role in the Pacers’ postseason success, including leading the team to the NBA’s first in-season tournament and showing consistent late-game heroics.“He’s been a clutch performer late in games. I think he’s got one of the highest closing percentages in the NBA,” George said.“He’s proven he’s reliable as the number one option.”Although Haliburton is primarily a pass-first point guard, George praised his versatility, “He can be your late-game scorer. He can be an isolation player… He scratched the surface of superstardom. He’s here.”But with high praise comes high expectations, and that pressure showed in Game 5. The Pacers fell flat in Madison Square Garden, losing 111-94 and allowing the Knicks to cut the series deficit to 3-2. Haliburton, who was electric in Game 4 with a triple-double, managed just 8 points in the loss.Following the game, Haliburton was not losing his mind over the loss. He urged his team to stay focused.“We’re a resilient group,” he told ESPN. “We understand what the stakes are... We’re fine. There’s no need to panic or anything.”That mindset will be crucial in Game 6, especially with analysts like Charles Barkley calling it a “must-win” for Indiana. If they lose at home, a Game 7 in New York looms.Also Read: Tyrese Haliburton vs Jalen Brunson – Who has better stats in the Eastern Conference Finals 2025?

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

CUTTACK: One look at the stands on Saturday evening at the Barabati Stadium , and one could have been forgiven for mistaking it for match day instead of match eve.The Odisha Cricket Association 's (OCA) decision to open part of the stands for fans to watch India train, for free, ahead of the crucial second ODI against England here was a hit, with the stadium nearly half full.The loudest cheers from the 20,000-plus crowd were reserved for the man who missed the first ODI in Nagpur with a sore right knee — Virat Kohli Saturday's nets, however, suggested Kohli was not going to sit out another game. One of the fittest cricketers around, the former India captain last missed a match — before the Nagpur ODI — more than three years ago, the Johannesburg Test against South Africa in Jan 2022. Fit and raring to go, the star batter was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.While England completely skipped Saturday's practice, many India players also skipped the optional session, including last-match hero Shreyas Iyer , vice-captain Shubman Gill , debutant Harshit Rana, comeback man Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said during the prematch media interaction.With a fit-again Kohli back in the playing XI, India will face a selection dilemma as they prepare to tick all the boxes ahead of the Champions Trophy and seal the series before going to Ahmedabad.Will Iyer lose his place to Kohli if the team management decides to continue with Yashasvi Jaiswal to keep the left-right opening combination going with captain Rohit Sharma ? Kotak, however, bypassed any queries on who should make way for Kohli on Sunday.""I think that's what the head coach and captain can talk about. But yes, definitely a lefty-righty combination is there. But I would say that question is not something which I would like to answer, to be very honest,"" was Kotak's diplomatic answer.Rohit's form will certainly also be a concern for the side, no matter how the management tries to brush aside any doubts regarding his continuous run of poor form. Rohit, incidentally, got out after scoring only two runs in the first ODI of this series.Rohit coming back into form will certainly be a big boost for the hosts ahead of the ICC event starting on Feb 19. The track looks a belter and could well be the right platform for the ‘Hitman' to get some much-needed runs under his belt.Meanwhile, KL Rahul is likely to get another look-in as the wicketkeeper-batter ahead of Rishabh Pant, who batted for long in the nets. However, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh bowled long spells during the practice session and could replace Shami, who might be rested to manage his workload following a long injury layoff.Although dew factor is unlikely to come into play here, batting second will be the preferred choice, as chasing teams have won 12 out of the 19 ODIs played here over the years.","Virat Kohli was the first to hit the nets and batted for nearly an hour before leaving the ground first, shouldering his cricket coffin.

Delhi Results 2025: 'LinkedIn Lessons' from Brand BJP's win and Brand AAP's loss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-results-2025-linkedin-lessons-from-brand-bjps-win-and-brand-aaps-loss/articleshow/118066797.cms,"AAP: From Disruptor to Establishment to Decline



AAP was the ultimate political startup—the kind that raises Series A, B, and C funding at record speed, becomes a unicorn, and then implodes under its own weight. It was supposed to be the alternative to traditional politics, the fresh face in a crowded market, a party that rejected caste, religion, and dynasty-driven politics.

But somewhere along the way, it stopped being a startup and started behaving like an old-school corporate giant—bloated, bureaucratic, and overconfident.

1) From Lean & Agile to Bureaucratic & Slow

AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach—the political equivalent of a D2C brand shaking up a legacy market.

Over time, it became centralized and top-heavy, with decision-making confined to a handful of leaders. MLAs became inaccessible, the leadership became distant, and ground-level mobilization weakened. No succession planning. Kejriwal remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force.

remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force. The result? Voters saw it as just another party, not the disruptor it once was.

2) A Reputation Built on Ethics, Lost to Scandals

AAP built its brand on fighting corruption—but its own leadership got embroiled in one of the biggest scandals of its time, the liquor policy scam.

Manish Sisodia, Sanjay Singh, and even Kejriwal himself faced corruption allegations, undoing years of anti-corruption positioning.

The Sheesh Mahal controversy—where Kejriwal’s residence was allegedly renovated with ₹45 crore of taxpayer money—completely shattered the “humble leader” narrative.

AAP’s response? Defensive, aggressive, and dismissive. Instead of damage control, it doubled down on denial—a classic PR blunder.

The perception shift was swift and brutal—from “anti-corruption warriors” to just another power-hungry political entity.

3) Ignoring the Middle-Class Voter That Built Its Base

AAP was originally the party of the middle class—frustrated taxpayers who wanted clean governance and economic relief.

Over time, its focus shifted to freebies and populist policies, leaving the middle class feeling ignored.

BJP stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters.

stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters. Kejriwal’s pre-election outreach to the middle class felt forced and last-minute—while BJP had already solidified its positioning.

Takeaway ? A business (or party) that forgets its core customer will eventually lose them.

4) Blaming External Factors Instead of Owning Failures

For 10 years, AAP blamed the Centre, the LG, and opposition parties for everything.

The “victim card” was effective in the early years but wore thin by 2025—voters expected governance, not excuses.

BJP flipped this weakness into an advantage, promising that with a BJP-led government, there would be no Centre-state conflicts, leading to “seamless governance.”

The narrative changed from “AAP vs. BJP” to “AAP vs. Results.” Lesson? Leaders who constantly shift blame instead of delivering solutions lose credibility.

5) Strategic Missteps and Lack of Political Alliances

AAP contested separately from Congress, which led to a split in the anti-BJP vote.

Rahul Gandhi’s direct attacks on Kejriwal made matters worse—AAP was getting hit from both sides.

Internal conflicts weakened the party further. Atishi and Saurabh Bharadwaj were seen as Kejriwal’s successors, but there was no clear transition strategy.

BJP: A Masterclass in Strategic Adaptation

BJP’s 2025 win in Delhi was not a Modi-centric sweep but a well-calibrated organizational comeback. After a lackluster 2024 Lok Sabha performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader.

performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader. Unlike AAP, BJP adapted, restructured, and executed flawlessly.

1) Moving Beyond Modi Dependency

BJP understood that Delhi’s electorate needed a more localized approach.

Instead of making the election about Modi, it focused on governance, urban issues, and direct voter engagement.

No CM face? It didn’t matter. The party projected collective leadership instead of relying on one individual.

By decentralizing its campaign, BJP looked more stable and future-ready.

2) Adopting AAP’s Own Strategies Against It

BJP neutralized AAP’s welfare advantage—promising free electricity, continued subsidies, and additional financial support for women.

Middle-class tax reliefs were announced just before the elections, ensuring they won over voters that AAP had neglected.

The manifesto focused on real urban issues—pollution control, traffic congestion, and infrastructure—exactly what AAP had failed to address convincingly.

Lesson? The best way to beat a competitor is to adopt their strengths while exposing their weaknesses.

3) Letting Congress Do The Attacking



BJP didn’t need to attack AAP aggressively—Rahul Gandhi and Congress did that for them.

By letting AAP and Congress fight it out, BJP consolidated its voter base while the opposition split.

AAP’s credibility suffered more because the attacks came from within the anti-BJP camp.

A strategic win, without unnecessary effort.

4) A Disciplined, Focused, and Well-Executed Campaign

BJP stayed on message, focusing on corruption, governance, and economic stability.

The campaign was structured and well-planned, unlike AAP’s which seemed reactive and disorganized.

The promise to investigate AAP’s corruption cases resonated with voters, reinforcing BJP’s stance on accountability.

In business terms? BJP had a clear marketing strategy, strong brand positioning, and flawless execution.

5) Final Takeaways

Adaptability is key. BJP recalibrated after its 2024 Lok Sabha setbacks, while AAP remained stagnant.

Brand trust is fragile. AAP built its image on honesty but lost credibility due to scandals and mismanagement.

Execution matters more than rhetoric. BJP delivered a disciplined, well-structured campaign.

Leadership succession planning is critical. AAP failed to build second-line leadership, while BJP showcased organizational depth.

Voters reward governance, not excuses. After a decade in power, AAP’s blame game no longer worked.

Politics, like business, rewards those who adapt, execute, and deliver.

Ah, another election, another flood of LinkedIn wisdom posts—where every poll result is a ""case study,"" every political leader is a ""CEO,"" and every campaign is an ""MBA-level lesson in leadership."" Some call it democracy, but on LinkedIn, it’s all about business jargon and corporate analogies.So, let’s break this down the LinkedIn way.BJP, on the other hand, had a structured, disciplined campaign with clear messaging and no internal rifts. In politics and business, a divided team rarely wins.","AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach.

2025 highlights: Familiar faces and dramatic falls



Is it just madness or tradition





Every year on a steep hill in Gloucestershire, England, hundreds gather to chase a rolling 7-pound wheel of Double Gloucester cheese down a dangerously steep slope. Known as the Cooper’s Hill Cheese Rolling Contest, the event is chaotic, absurd, and completely thrilling. With participants tumbling, somersaulting, and crashing their way to the bottom, the headline “People sprint to catch a 7-pound wheel of cheese” is technically accurate, but it doesn’t quite capture the madness, tradition, and injuries that define this bizarre British spectacle. So, is it a good headline? That depends on what you’re hoping to convey.The Cheese Rolling Contest is an annual event held on Cooper’s Hill in Brockworth, Gloucestershire. Dating back at least two centuries, and possibly much longer, the race involves competitors hurtling down a 200-yard slope after a large wheel of cheese. The goal? Be the first to reach the bottom and claim the cheese as a prize. It sounds simple, but the event is notorious for its steep incline, dangerous tumbles, and frequent injuries.The hill is so steep that it's nearly impossible to stay upright. Most participants end up tumbling head over heels, colliding with each other or the ground.Gravity takes over quickly, and the cheese, reaching speeds of up to 70 mph, is almost never actually caught. Still, competitors willingly risk sprains, fractures, and concussions for a shot at glory and a round of cheese.This year, German YouTuber Tom Kopke claimed victory for the second year in a row. Shirtless and triumphant, he declared, “I risked my life for this. It’s my cheese. Back to back.” On the women’s side, Ava Sender Logan from London tumbled repeatedly but emerged victorious, saying, “It felt quite long coming down and then I hit my head. I’m fine.” Around them, spectators packed the woods and fences for a glimpse of the chaos.While the event may seem absurd to outsiders, for locals and returning participants, it’s a point of pride and cultural identity. Despite calls to regulate or cancel it over safety concerns, the contest continues to thrive, drawing international competitors and media attention. Volunteers, medics, and long-time residents treat it as an important local tradition","The Cheese Rolling Contest is an annual event held on Cooper’s Hill in Brockworth, Gloucestershire.

Two promising Indian-American spellers — Sarvadnya Kadam from Bossier City, Louisiana, and Sarv Dharavane from Austin, Texas — saw their dreams of clinching the 2025 Scripps National Spelling Bee title slip away after stumbling on one word each in the high-stakes final rounds of the competition.Kadam faltered on “,” relating to a type of stingless bee, while Dharavane was undone by “,” a name for a small North American fish. Their exits briefly opened the door for Faizan Zaki, who had advanced to the 18th round with a chance to win it all.But Zaki's path to triumph nearly crumbled when he misspelled “,” a genus of flowering plants, starting it hastily with a “k.” Judge Mary Brooks rang the bell almost immediately, noting Zaki had skipped his usual process of asking questions before spelling. In a rare twist, the premature elimination of all three top contenders in the same round led to a reinstatement of both Kadam and Dharavane.The final stretch of the Bee saw an intense display of resilience and poise. Zaki, Kadam, Dharavane, Harini Murali, Brian Liu, and Aishwarya Kallakuri delivered round after round of perfect spelling, with a remarkable streak of 23 consecutive correct words before the field began to thin again under mounting pressure.Zaki, known for his composed stage presence—hands tucked in his Aeropostale hoodie pockets, long dark hair falling between his glasses and eyes, and rhythmic gestures while spelling—eventually outlasted his peers to win the championship.Zaki’s victory was particularly special—it was his fourth appearance (2019, 2023, 2024, 2025) and he became only the fifth speller ever to win the Bee the year after finishing second, a feat last accomplished in 2001. With this title, he becomes the 110th champion in the Bee’s storied history.Next year, the finals will return to Washington D.C., moving to Constitution Hall after more than a decade in Maryland.While Sarvadnya Kadam and Sarv Dharavane fell short of the trophy, their poise, linguistic mastery, and grit earned them admiration across the nation. In a contest that celebrates precision, pressure, and perseverance, these young spellers proved they’re already champions in their own right.(With inputs from USA today)","Sarvadnya Kadam and Sarv Dharavane faltered on one word each in the high-stakes final rounds of the competition.

In a heart-stopping finish to the 2025 Scripps National Spelling Bee, 13-year-old Faizan Zaki from Dallas, Texas, emerged victorious, spelling “Chaldee” correctly in the 20th round to secure the championship. However, the drama wasn’t over yet — Zaki was required by the judges to spell one more word flawlessly before being officially crowned champion, a challenge he met with confidence and without any assistance.Zaki’s win was a story of redemption. Last year, he narrowly lost in the spell-off to Bruhat Soma after rushing his final word and stumbling on the homonym of “commelina.” This time, determined to avoid a repeat, he made sure the contest didn’t go to a spell-off. “I’m really happy,” Zaki said after his triumph.The competition, held over three intense days outside Washington DC, featured some of the country’s best young spellers. Zaki’s steady composure was visible as he kept his hands tucked into the pockets of his black Aeropostale hoodie, his long dark hair falling between his eyeglasses. His trademark hand gesture — a back-and-forth motion with each letter — reappeared as he confidently asked the necessary questions and spelled each word correctly.Runner-up Sarvadnya Kadam and third-place finisher Sarv Dharavane, the youngest finalist at 11 years old and a fifth grader, impressed the crowd with their skill and poise. Dharavane, known for his relaxed demeanor, greeted the microphone with a casual “wassup” and confidently spelled his words, even uttering “here goes nothing” before a successful attempt.The competition’s tension peaked in the 18th round, when Zaki had a chance to clinch the title after Kadam and Dharavane misspelled their words. However, Zaki’s excitement got the better of him, and he began spelling before fully completing his thought process, prompting judge Mary Brooks to ring the bell, invalidating his attempt. This unexpected turn allowed Kadam and Dharavane back into the contest, prolonging the battle for the championship.Throughout the finals, the field showed incredible depth and precision. At one point, the finalists spelled 23 words consecutively without a single mistake. The pressure finally cracked for some contenders: Harini Mulari missed the last letter of “tekke,” Brian Liu stumbled on “kyah,” and Aishwarya Kallakuri faltered on “Keighley,” a town in northern England.By the final rounds, only Zaki, Kadam, and Dharavane remained standing, facing off in a test of nerves and vocabulary mastery. The six finalists demonstrated remarkable skill, delivering multiple perfect rounds even as the difficulty level escalated.The “Still-Standing Six” demonstrated incredible endurance. They included:Other notable finalists included Esha Marupudi, Oliver Halkett, and Akshaj Somisetty, with Somisetty being the first eliminated in the finals after missing a vocabulary question on the word “imbroglio.”The 2025 Scripps National Spelling Bee marked the 100th anniversary of the competition, which began in 1925 as a collaboration among newspapers to identify America’s best young spellers. While it is the 97th edition due to cancellations during World War II and the 2020 pandemic, the Bee continues to be a celebrated tradition.The contest has evolved over the years, including the addition of the “spell-off” in response to the historic eight-way tie in 2019, designed to prevent ties by testing speed and accuracy in rapid-fire spelling rounds.Winning the Bee comes with more than just the glory. Zaki will receive:All finalists receive $2,000, with tiered prizes awarded down to sixth place.This year’s Bee Week began with 243 spellers representing every U.S. state and territory, as well as international participants from Canada, the Bahamas, Germany, Ghana, Kuwait, and Nigeria. The youngest contestant was eight-year-old Zachary Teoh from Texas, while about 30% of participants were 14 years old, nearing the age limit.Scripps estimates that between 10 and 11 million children participate in local and regional Bees each year, making it a truly nationwide educational event.The final rounds were broadcast live on Scripps-owned networks including ION, Bounce, Grit, and streamed on multiple platforms. The finals began with an enthusiastic “Bear Down!” from semifinalist Yahya Ali Mohammed, setting a spirited tone.After the finals, Scripps announced that starting in 2026, the Bee would move from the Gaylord National Convention Center in Maryland back to Constitution Hall in Washington, D.C., the site of many early competitions.Faizan Zaki’s victory puts him in elite company as only the fifth speller ever to win the Bee the year after finishing second — a feat last accomplished in 2001. His steady nerves, methodical approach, and clear love for the competition suggest he will be remembered among the great champions of this historic event.","13-year-old Faizan Zaki from Dallas, Texas, emerged victorious, spelling “Chaldee” correctly in the 20th round to secure the championship. Zaki’s win was a story of redemption. Last year, he narrowly lost in the spell-off to Bruhat Soma after rushing his final word.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121510519,imgsize-985143,width-400,resizemode-4/121510519.jpg"

'I don't want to be a one-season wonder': Punjab Kings' Shashank Singh





A day after a one-sided affair in Qualifier 1, the Eliminator between Gujarat Titans (GT) and Mumbai Indians (MI) proved to be exactly what the doctor ordered at the New PCA Stadium in Mullanpur. It went down to the wire as MI defeated GT by 20 runs. MI will now take on Punjab Kings in Qualifier 2 on Sunday at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Gujarat.Rohit Sharma (81 off 50 balls; 9x4, 4x6) made the most of two reprieves offered by GT fielders as the five-time champions delivered a strong statement in the must-win match. After winning the toss, MI posted a formidable 228 for 5.Rohit was dropped twice—first by Gerald Coetzee and then by Kusal Mendis—and he made GT pay for those missed chances. In the second over, Prasidh Krishna banged one in short, and Rohit miscued a pull high into the air. Coetzee had enough time, kept his eyes on the ball, but shelled the skier. Rohit was on 4 at the time, looking to break free with a swivel pull.In the next over, Rohit dispatched two delightful boundaries off Mohammed Siraj. Siraj could’ve had the last laugh, but Mendis fumbled a thick edge behind the stumps—failing to grab it in two attempts.The fourth over completely turned the tide in MI’s favour, as Jonny Bairstow hammered 26 runs off Prasidh Krishna’s second over—featuring three sixes, including a monster hit into the second tier at Mullanpur.Making his first appearance of the season, Bairstow came out firing on all cylinders. He and Rohit forged a rollicking 84-run opening partnership, with 79 of those runs coming in the powerplay. Bairstow blazed his way to a 22-ball 47 before falling to Sai Kishore.The powerplay onslaught set the tone, and the rest of the MI batting unit kept the momentum going. Suryakumar Yadav (33 off 20 balls; 1x4, 3x6) and Tilak Varma (25 off 11; 3x6) chipped in with impactful cameos. Captain Hardik Pandya (22* off 9; 3x6) provided the finishing touches, smashing Coetzee for 22 runs in the final over.Prasidh Krishna (2/53) and Sai Kishore (2/42) took two wickets each, but most of GT’s bowlers proved expensive. However, Team India management and Test captain Shubman Gill may be concerned after Mohammed Siraj, who dismissed Tilak Varma in the 18th over, appeared to pull his hamstring later in the same over.Sai Sudharsan continues to redefine orthodoxy in T20 cricket. His classical technique offers a refreshing counter to the notion that T20 cricket is eroding traditional skills. In this IPL season, Sudharsan has shown that the two formats—Test and T20—can indeed coexist. While broadcasters may try to strip away the “cricket” from T20, players like Sudharsan keep putting it right back in.On Friday, the 23-year-old produced yet another masterclass. He scored a classy 80 off 49 balls, laced with 10 boundaries and a six. Despite his aggressive approach, Sudharsan rarely loses shape, showcasing a full range of proper cricketing shots.GT’s chase began on a poor note, with Trent Boult removing skipper Shubman Gill for just 1. But Sudharsan continued in red-hot form, hitting a six off Boult and finding support in Kusal Mendis, who launched two sixes in the same over. The duo kept the momentum going, especially as Sudharsan struck two boundaries off Richard Gleeson’s first over.Hardik Pandya brought himself on but was welcomed with two boundaries from Sudharsan and one from Mendis, who narrowly escaped a run-out at the end of the powerplay. However, Mendis was soon out in bizarre fashion—hit wicket after stepping on the stumps and falling flat on his back.Sudharsan found another able partner in Washington Sundar (48 off 24), and together they stitched an 84-run stand off just 46 balls. At that point, GT looked well on course to make Qualifier 2. But Jasprit Bumrah, the ultimate T20 cheat code, yorked Sundar to break the stand.Shortly after, Gleeson dismissed Sudharsan, effectively ending GT’s hopes. Lower-order efforts from Sherfane Rutherford (24), Rahul Tewatia (16), and Shahrukh Khan (16) weren’t enough, as MI held their nerves and marched on to the next round.",Mumbai Indians defeated Gujarat Titans by 20 runs in IPL Qualifier 2. Rohit Sharma (81) and Jonny Bairstow (47) scored centuries for MI. MI will now take on Punjab Kings in the second Qualifier on Sunday.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121523727,imgsize-84954,width-400,resizemode-4/121523727.jpg"
