LUCKNOW: Living on the fringes, facing discrimination and exclusion in a variety of ways, persons with disabilities (PwDs) are now making their voice felt, and rightly too. From guaranteed income, increased job opportunities to improved accessibility to buildings and transportation, PwDs have put forward their demands from political parties in the ongoing Lok Sabha elections to improve their quality of life.They said they are pleased that three major political parties have promised to look into their issues, but they want more parties to focus on their demands and take tangible action beyond mere words.Furthermore, they emphasize the importance of enforcing existing laws like the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act (RPwD) 2016.Speaking to TOI, Arman Ali, executive director of the National Centre for Promotion of Employment for Disabled People (NCPEDP), stressed the importance of taking action to address the needs of people with disabilities.He highlighted the necessity for health insurance coverage aligned with Ayushman Bharat and increased representation in Parliament and governance.“Although some of these demands were included in the manifestos of major parties in the 2019 LS polls, they were not fulfilled,” he said.Ali emphasised the growing political awareness and participation among disabled individuals.Amit Rawat, a visually impaired PhD student from Lucknow University, pointed out that while one major party's manifesto included promises related to housing and transportation improvements, other parties focused on care centres, increased pensions, and Braille inclusion.“There is need for tangible action beyond words. Parties must prioritise employment for disabled individuals and address implementation issues such as train seat reservations etc,” he said.Another disabled student, Ram Vijay from Shakuntala Mishra Deemed University, expressed disappointment with the parties in failure to fulfill the previous promises.He cited the example of an app called Suramya Bharat, intended to assist disabled individuals in suggesting improvements to public spaces, which has not been effectively implemented.“We face challenges when we visit govt offices, access roads and even schools, colleges. There is a need for concerted efforts from all political parties to address these issues,” he said.Shiv Prasad, an activist from Maharajganj, highlighted disparities in pension amounts across states and stressed the need for uniformity and increased support.He also pointed out the lack of clarity in provisions of the RPwD Act, emphasizing the need for representation of disabled people in politics and policymaking.Krishna Kumar, an MEd student from Shakuntala University, stressed the importance of increasing reservation for disabled individuals in education and employment.He explained that the types of disabilities covered under the act have increased significantly, necessitating a proportional increase in reservation quotas to ensure inclusivity.*Committed to continuing the provision of affordable housing prioritising persons with disabilities under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana*Accessible solutions tailored to the needs of disabled individuals*Raise pensions for disabilities under the National Social Assistance Programme from Rs 200-500 per month to Rs 1,000 pm.Expand constitutional provisions of Article 15 and 16 to prohibit discrimination based on disability and impairment, or sexual orientation.*Care centres and inclusion of Braille.*Recognise Braille script as sign language and enforce the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016.*Proposed measures such as disability budgeting, earmarking 5% allocations across ministries for the disabled, and removal of GST on aids and appliances."," persons with disabilities (PwDs) are now making their voice felt, and rightly too.

5 reasons to be bullish on wheat this year,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/5-reasons-to-be-bullish-on-wheat-this-year/articleshow/109767756.cms,"New Seed Varieties

Private Purchase Zooms

Diversifying Markets

Moving Away From Paddy

Most of the wheat has arrived in the mandis of Punjab and Haryana, the two states with the highest procurement . And by all accounts it’s a good crop , providing much needed comfort to govt and private players .The crop, which comes on the back of a good yield this year – as high as 25-26 quintals an acre in parts of Punjab (against 22 quintals or so last year) – is much watched given that silos emptied out after two years of poor harvest.Govt is grappling with the lowest level of wheat stocks in 16 years – a little over 75 lakh tonnes at the start of April against the buffer requirement of 74.6 lakh tonnes for this time of year – and globally, too, prices are under pressure.So far, govt procurement is estimated at 200 lakh tonnes, compared with 190 lakh tonnes at the same time last year. In Punjab, the prolonged winter has resulted in around 91 lakh tonnes reaching mandis so far, compared with 103 lakh tonnes at this time last year.“We are seeing the best crop in at least five-six years,” says Manjinder Singh Mann, secretary of Khanna Agricultural Produce Market Committee.In Karnal, Gyanendra Singh, director of ICAR-Indian Institute of Wheat and Barley Research, lists out multiple reasons for this year’s bumper crop, which he argues may beat govt estimates. “The area under cultivation has increased, we had a good winter, which was prolonged and there has been accelerated deployment of climate resistant varieties. Nearly 60% of the varieties were released during the last five years.” New varieties are less prone to damage by pests, something that farmers in the two states are reporting.At the FCI headquarters in Delhi, officials reckon that govt procurement could reach 310 lakh tonnes, against 262 lakh tonnes last year, based on higher purchases in most parts – from Punjab and Haryana to Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan. While Punjab is going to remain on top with purchases of over 130 lakh tonnes (121 lakh tonnes last year), Haryana is estimated to generate 70 lakh tonnes this year (against last year’s 63 lakh tonnes). FCI officials are banking on a 10-fold jump from UP to around 20 lakh tonnes as govt purchases currently are estimated at 3.4 lakh tonnes, compared with last year’s 5.6 lakh tonnes. They are also estimating a threeto four-fold increase in Rajasthan, from around 4 lakh tonnes to nearly 12-14 lakh tonnes. MP remains a source of bother, although the target is to buy around 80 lakh tonnes, compared with 71 lakh tonnes last year.But it isn’t just govt agencies that are buying whatever is reaching the mandis, private players are ramping up their stocks too.In Khanna, once the largest grain market, around 40% of the purchases may end up in private hands. In neighbouring Rajpura, which also sees robust trading, more than half the stock brought to the mandi has been purchased by flour mills, some of whom sell to big players, such as ITC, Adani and Nestle.Davinder Singh, president of the arhtia association in the APMC, estimates that of the 25 lakh bags of 50kg each, private players will this year buy around 10 lakh. Last year, they had bought 4.5 lakh of the 22 lakh bags in the mandi, and in 2022, two lakh of the 14 lakh bags.In Gharaunda and Karnal, two mandis in Haryana that TOI recently visited, private demand is strong.While private players have been present in the grain market, and their share of total purchases is rising, this year is different. “The govt does not have too much stock, so we don’t know if it will undertake open market sale this year, something it did actively last year,” said Atul Goyal, of Amar Roller Flour Mills, a large buyer from Rajpura.There is also expectation of prices rising in the coming months. Against a price of Rs 2,280 a quintal for private players at the moment, prices for June are around Rs 2,450 and may rise to Rs 3,000 by Oct, says Singh. Against procurement of just under one lakh tonnes of wheat in Khanna, in 2023, Rajpura reported purchases of over 105 lakh tonnes. One of the reasons for higher private purchases in Punjab may also have to do with state govts in MP and Rajasthan deciding to pay a bonus of Rs 125 a quintal above the Centre’s minimum support price of Rs 2,275 a quintal, resulting in some trade moving out.In any case, arhtias – the middlemen who run the show in mandis in Punjab and Haryana and were seen to be the key driver of the farmers’ protest when govt had decided to amend the farm laws – prefer private sales as they earn Rs 57 a quintal, compared with Rs 46 from govt. Besides, the payment comes on the same day, while they have to wait for the end of the season with govt procurement.For farmers in this part of the country, arhtias are the crucial link, often providing loans during marriages or emergencies. Of course, direct payment into bank accounts has meant that cash flows to the farmers within three days in Haryana and in around a week in Punjab.“The system favours us now. Now, arhtias have to ask us for money, instead of them deducting the money and paying us,” says Sukhbir Kumar, a farmer selling his produce in Gharaunda.For years, farmers from adjoining areas in Uttar Pradesh, or even distant Bihar, would see their produce sold in mandis in Haryana and Punjab. But with UP govt deciding to aggressively push procurement, Karnal is seeing fewer farmers drive past the state border.Ram Pal Singh from Shamli is one of the exceptions. He has driven past police barricades at the border to sell his 80 quintals of wheat to arhtias, settling for cash payment. “I have been coming here for more than 30 years. The mandi on our side does not have facilities like here,” he says, smoking a bidi at a tea stall as he waits for the grains to be cleaned.Ramesh Yadav from Madhepura is part of the thousands of workers who travel to Khanna every year. He has already harvested 20 quintals of wheat in his village, selling a part of it at lower than MSP. “The maize (which has also been sold below MSP) will travel to Punjab and fetch 10-15% more,” says Yadav as he breaks for lunch after spreading the wheat to dry in Khanna.“No one in this part of the country eats parmal rice that is procured. It is either distributed in the poorer states or supplied for mid-day meals or in jails,” says the secretary of one of the APMCs in Haryana.But farmers still prefer to grow paddy as the state machinery purchases it at the MSP, shielding them from price fluctuations. While Haryana govt procures some amount of mustard and sunflower seeds, it isn’t enough.“Last year, I sold maize below MSP. In my fields, I may not be able to grow urad or mung,” says Kawaljit Singh in Karnal.Standing a few metres away, Roshan Lal, who tills around 30 acres to grow wheat, paddy and potatoes, acknowledges the problem with paddy. “ I grow paddy because I get MSP. With maize the yield is good, it requires lower amount of water, fertiliser and pesticides, but I may not be able to sell it,” says Lal, who complains of low income for farmers and intends to migrate to the US in a few years to join his son in California.In Punjab the problem is even more acute as there is no govt procurement, farmers said.“The water table has gone down, now we find water at 150 feet, compared with 100 feet five years ago. I know there is a problem and it will only increase. I can try other crops such as dal, maize or mustard, provided there is assured procurement,” says Harinder Singh from Channi Majra village near Khanna.When farmers in Punjab hit the streets earlier this year, Centre had suggested it could guarantee procurement of maize, pulses and cotton for five years to farmers who diversified from paddy, a key source of pollution in north India post-Diwali due to stubble burning. The demand was, however, rejected by farmer unions.","Most of the wheat has arrived in the mandis of Punjab and Haryana, the two states with the highest procurement. The prolonged winter has resulted in around 91 lakh tonnes reaching mandis so far, compared with 103 lakh tonnes at this time last year. “We are seeing the best crop in at least five-six years,” says Manjinder Singh Mann, secretary of Khanna Agricultural Produce Market Committee.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109767792,imgsize-2239818,width-400,resizemode-4/109767792.jpg"
10 years in jail for nothing Who should pay for it?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/10-years-in-jail-for-nothing-who-should-pay-for-it/articleshow/109766946.cms,"How bad is the situation?

Worse under special laws

Trial court has key role

How much compensation?

What connects three professors — from Delhi, Kolhapur and Nagpur — to 17 residents of a village in Madhya Pradesh? All of them spent time in jail as undertrials or convicts before they were either acquitted or granted bail due to lack of evidence, with the courts questioning the cases against them.Take the case of former Delhi University professor GN Saibaba.Acquitted by the Bombay high court in March, Saibaba was convicted for Maoist activities under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) and spent nearly 10 years behind bars as an undertrial and convict.In its judgment, the high court observed that the prosecution failed to link Saibaba to any crime. “In fact, there is no evidence brought forth by the prosecution to connect the persons (Saibaba and other accused) with any actual act of terrorism which had taken place in the past or to demonstrate how the persons were directly connected with and responsible for the commission of any other act of terrorism,” the court observed.After his release, Saibaba — who is disabled — said he had developed severe medical conditions in prison, including a heart ailment. The former professor was also denied permission to attend his mother’s funeral. “The prison department and government robbed me of fulfilling my mother’s wishes in her final days,” he said.There are many other cases, not always in serious offences, where people spend years behind bars waiting to be exonerated. The term used to describe cases where a person is arrested, jailed and denied bail for extended periods of time falls under what can be categorised as “miscarriage of justice”.Experts as well as a Law Commission report point to this problem being very prevalent in the Indian criminal justice system. The price for this is almost entirely borne by the person accused, like losing prime years of one’s life and emerging with health problems acquired during incarceration.In countries like the US, and the UK, those who face wrongful prosecution are eligible to file claims for compensation , which are then evaluated. In India, courts have pointed to lack of evidence and even malicious or politically-motivated prosecutions. But those who suffer the legal process don’t even get an apology, forget compensation.According to National Crime Records Bureau data from all states for 2022, close to 75% of those in India’s 1,330 jails are undertrials.Of the 4.34 lakh undertrials in Indian prisons, almost half are aged between 18 and 30 years, their most productive years economically. A total of 3.26 lakh inmates are facing cases filed under Indian Penal Code offences. The 2022 data indicates that the overall conviction rate for offences under the IPC is about 35%.Take the case of the 17 people arrested from Mohad in Madhya Pradesh’s Burhanpur district in 2017. Their alleged crime was celebrating Pakistan’s victory in the ICC Champions Trophy final against India. Two of those aprehended were minors.They were initially accused of criminal conspiracy and promoting enmity. During some court hearings, slogans like “Desh ke gaddaron ko, goli maro salon ko” (shoot the traitors) and “atankwadiyon ko phansi do” (hang the terrorists) were shouted at them. They were in jail for more than six years as undertrials. All of them were acquitted by a district court.“After going through all the evidence, arguments and eyewitnesses, there was no proof that the accused raised slogans and burnt firecrackers,” the trial court’s judgment said.In the case of Kashmiri professor Javed Ahmed Hajam, who was teaching at a college in Maharashtra’s Kolhapur district, his ‘crime’ was posting two WhatsApp statuses in August 2022 that got him charged with promoting enmity.On August 5, his WhatsApp status said ‘Black Day Jammu & Kashmir’ to mark the abrogation of the state’s special status. On August 14, his WhatsApp status read: ‘Happy Independence Day Pakistan’.Hajam spent about a month behind bars and then fought a legal battle for nearly two years before the case was quashed by the Supreme Court. The court said everyone had a “right to be critical of the action of abrogation of Article 370 and the change of status of Jammu and Kashmir”.“If every criticism or protest of the actions of the State is to be held as an offence under Section 153A, democracy, which is an essential feature of the Constitution of India, will not survive,” the court observed.The court also made an observation about the need to educate the police machinery on the fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression.Under the stringent UAPA — where getting bail is even harder than other criminal cases — more than 24,000 people were accused in 5,027 cases registered between 2016 and 2020. Data revealed in response to a question in Rajya Sabha showed that just 212 people had been convicted in these cases, and 386 were acquitted.Justice Abhay Thipsay (retd) — who was in the Allahabad and Bombay high courts — said in many cases undertrials are not being granted bail and judges are shirking bail applications.“There is no doubt that there should be a process and it can emanate from the trial court’s judgment,” said Amit Desai, a senior Bombay high court advocate.According to Desai, the trial court is the best place to decide who can be held liable or responsible in a case where a person has been wrongly persecuted by an investigating agency or the prosecution.However, he said, some changes can be made to laws. An accused person, according to Desai, should have their rights enhanced just like the victims’ in the Criminal Procedure Code. “Balancing the rights of the victim and the accused is absolutely necessary,” he said.Sanjay Hegde, a senior advocate who mostly prac tises in the Supreme Court, also felt there should be a law to allow courts to rule on cases where the rights of the accused are completely ignored or violated during their prosecution.“There should be legislation which defines these things so that the trial courts feel empowered to make such observations or pass relevant orders,” said Hegde.The senior lawyer said cases where a person is acquitted for reasons other than wrongful prosecution shouldn’t be considered.Various suggestions about a special law to compensate victims did feature in a report submitted by the Law Commission in Aug 2018. But they have remained suggestions. The commission, headed by former Supreme Court judge Justice BS Chauhan, recommended a law to compensate victims of miscarriage of justice and special courts in every district that would decide cases quickly.Anyone acquitted by a court in a case should be able to file a claim, the report said. These special courts could have the power to direct the authorities to initiate proceedings against erring officials.The commission suggested an interim compensation between Rs 25,000 and Rs 50,000 in cases where a person spent more than six months in jail. It said the final compensation should be decided on the basis of all the losses caused to the petitioner — including loss of property, health, opportunities and family life.The report said the court should also provide petitioners with “non-pecuniary assistance” for the rehabilitation of victims.Justice Thipsay said the biggest challenge to addressing wrongful prosecutions is that society doesn’t feel very strongly about the issue. “People simply feel that if someone was wrongly prosecuted, he or she was eventually acquitted or discharged. So, that is enough,” he said. “There is no outrage, therefore the system feels that there is no need to do anything more,” he said.","Three professors and 17 residents of a village in Madhya Pradesh spent time in jail as undertrials or convicts.

Sisodia delaying trial in excise case: Court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sisodia-delaying-trial-in-excise-case-court/articleshow/109764644.cms,"NEW DELHI: While dismissing former deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia ’s second bail plea , a court rejected his contention that the proceedings in the money laundering case linked to the alleged liquor policy scam have been delayed or that the case is proceeding at a snail’s pace. The so-called delay, the court of special judge Kaveri Baweja opined, could clearly be attributable to Sisodia himself.“It is apparent that the applicant, individually and along with different accused, has been filing one or other application/making oral submissions frequently, some of them frivolous, that too on a piecemeal basis, apparently as a concerted effort for accomplishing the shared purpose of causing delay in the matter,” the judge said in the 42-page order issued on Tuesday while pronouncing that “the argument of the applicant that he has not contributed to the delay in proceedings or that the case has been proceeding at a snail’s pace, therefore, cannot be accepted”.Sisodia stated that the prosecution had assured the Supreme Court last year that the trial would conclude in six-eight months, and he was entitled to seek bail as per the apex court’s Oct 30, 2023 order if the trial was protracted and proceeded at a snail’s pace in the next three months.The court, however, said the steady progression of the case, despite the apparent attempts to slow down its progress, couldn’t by any standard be equated with a snail’s pace. “The so-called delay caused in the progression of the case is also clearly on account of reasons attributable to the applicant,” stated the order, which was made available on Wednesday.The court also rejected Sisodia’s argument seeking parity with co-accused Benoy Babu, who was released after 13 months in jail, saying there was a difference in the nature of allegations against them.Rejecting Sisodia’s contention that he should be released on bail because of the health condition of his wife, the court said his plea did not cite any medical emergency or urgent medical condition warranting his release. “The applicant in his application has mentioned that there is nobody in the family except him to support her (wife). However, this is factually incorrect as the applicant has a son who can take care of the applicant’s wife,” the judge said.“Even otherwise, from the medical record of the wife of the applicant as annexed with the application under consideration, it appears that she has been suffering from the said ailment for a long time and has also been receiving requisite medical treatment and care for the same. The application discloses no imminent or urgent need or any medical emergency warranting the release of the accused/applicant on bail for this reason,"" the court noted.Meanwhile, the court also listed 135 applications filed by different accused since April 2023 for various reasons, including requests to seek documents relied on by the prosecution, CCTV recordings of their custodial interrogation, and a request for interim bail.","Court rejects Manish Sisodia's contention that the proceedings in the money laundering case have been delayed or that the case is proceeding at a snail’s pace.

"Bengal on same page with Centre, Maha over community resources",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bengal-on-same-page-with-centre-maha-over-community-resources/articleshow/109763851.cms,"NEW DELHI: West Bengal on Wednesday walked the path taken by Union and Maharashtra govts to argue before a nine-judge Supreme Court bench that Article 39(b) of the Constitution should be interpreted to mean that material resources of the community would in certain circumstances include privately owned property to subserve the common good.Senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi, appearing for the Trinamool Congress govt, argued before a bench of CJI D Y Chandrachud and Justices Hrishikesh Roy, B V Nagarathna, S Dhulia, J B Pardiwala, Manoj Misra, R Bindal, S C Sharma and AG Masih that under the West Bengal Land Reforms Act, with its amendment, the state acquired vast tracts of privately held agricultural land and distributed it among landless farmers to ensure the mandate of the directive principles for distribution of material resources of the community to best subserve the common good.“The distribution may be piecemeal or kept in the control of a govt agency or even a private agency, so long as the benefits percolate through to the people as a common good. To illustrate, large privately owned ponds extending up to 500 acres can be acquired and put in control of a govt agency or a cooperative society so that the pond is preserved so as to subserve the common good,” Dwivedi argued.“Once the property is acquired, it indisputably becomes a material resource of the community. Upon acquisition, the private property vests in the state. All state property would be a material resource of the community, and upon acquisition, it must be distributed so as to subserve the common good,” he added.The state’s second counsel, Gopal Shankaranarayanan, argued in the same vein but suddenly changed tack to ruffle feathers by questioning the validity of SC’s five-judge bench judgment, which by three to two majority had last year declined to grant legal status to same-sex marriages.He said the constitutional court, having been convinced about discrimination faced by LGBTQIA+ community, should have moulded relief under Article 14 (right to equality). He said the majority judgment was ‘per incuriam’ as it did not heed the settled principle that in the face of discrimination, relief should be provided. He went on to argue that the same-sex marriage issue needed to be referred to a larger bench of seven judges.This drew objection from solicitor general Tushar Mehta who said this issue was unrelated to the interpretation of Article 39(b) engaging the attention of the nine-judge bench.","West Bengal walked the path taken by Union and Maharashtra govts to argue before a nine-judge Supreme Court bench.

Senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi, appearing for West Bengal, gave examples of land, water, forests and several other resources that could be acquired, even if privately owned, by the state for distribution of their benefits to the community at large.Dwivedi said, “Various expressions in these clauses of Article 39 have been used in the context of the operation of the economic system and the idea is to ensure that all the material resources are used to best subserve the common good, and to see that they do not cause common detriment.“These provisions are basically intended to operate with respect to material resources in the hands of private persons so as to ensure common good and not common detriment.”",Solicitor general Tushar Mehta said Article 39(b) indirectly admitted the limitations of the generation of the day to fully fathom the nature and character of future dynamics of economic situations the country would face.

Hindu marriage invalid without customary rituals: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hindu-marriage-invalid-without-customary-rituals-sc/articleshow/109763530.cms,"NEW DELHI: Observing that a Hindu marriage is a sacred process and not a “song and dance” and “wining and dining” event, Supreme Court has held that customary rituals and ceremonies prescribed under the Hindu Marriage Act must be assiduously, strictly and religiously followed, failing which a marriage would be declared invalid even after it has been registered.A SC bench said Section 7 of the Act lists ‘ceremonies of a Hindu marriage’, which have to be complied with for validity of the marriage and if it is not done, then the marriage is not deemed valid in the eye of the law. Section 7 says a Hindu marriage may be solemnised in accordance with the customary rites and ceremonies of either party thereto.A Hindu marriage is not an event for “song and dance”, “wining and dining” or a commercial transaction , the Supreme Court has observed and said it cannot be recognised in the “absence of a valid ceremony” under the Hindu Marriage Act. A bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and Augustine George Masih said a Hindu marriage is a ‘samskara’ and a sacrament which has to be accorded its status as an institution of great value in Indian society.In its recent order passed in the matter of two trained commercial pilots, who sought a divorce decree without performing a valid Hindu marriage ceremony, the bench urged young men and women to “think deeply about the institution of marriage even before they enter upon it and as to how sacred the said institution is, in Indian society”.“A marriage is not an event for ‘song and dance’ and ‘wining and dining’ or an occasion to demand and exchange dowry and gifts by undue pressure leading to possible initiation of criminal proceedings thereafter. A marriage is not a commercial transaction. It is a solemn foundational event celebrated so as to establish a relationship between a man and a woman who acquire the status of a husband and wife for an evolving family in future which is a basic unit of Indian society,” the bench said.Terming the marriage as sacred as it provides a lifelong, dignity-affirming, equal, consensual and healthy union of two individuals, the bench said a Hindu marriage facilitates procreation, consolidates the unit of family and solidifies the spirit of fraternity within various communities.“We deprecate the practice of young men and women seeking to acquire the status of being a husband and a wife to each other and therefore purportedly being married, in the absence of a valid marriage ceremony under the provisions of the (Hindu Marriage) Act such as in the instant case where the marriage between the parties was to take place later,” the bench said.In its April 19 order, the bench said where a Hindu marriage is not performed in accordance with the applicable rites or ceremonies such as ‘saptapadi’ (taking seven steps by the groom and the bride jointly before the sacred fire), the marriage will not be construed as a Hindu marriage.“We further observe that a Hindu marriage is a sacrament and has a sacred character. In the context of saptapadi in a Hindu marriage, according to Rig Veda, after completing the seventh step (saptapadi) the bridegroom says to his bride, ‘With seven steps we have become friends (sakha). May I attain to friendship with thee; may I not be separated from thy friendship’. A wife is considered to be half of oneself (ardhangini) but to be accepted with an identity of her own and to be a co-equal partner in the marriage,” it said. In Hindu Law , marriage is a sacrament or a ‘samskara’ and it is the foundation for a new family, the bench noted, and said, “There is nothing like a “better-half” in a marriage but the spouses are equal halves in a marriage.”Observing that with the passage of centuries and the enactment of the Act, monogamy is the only legally approved form of relationship between a husband and a wife. “The (Hindu Marriage) Act has categorically discarded polyandry and polygamy and all other such types of relationships. The intent of the Parliament is also that there should be only one form of marriage having varied rites and customs and rituals,” it said.","A Hindu marriage is not an event for “song and dance”, “wining and dining” or a commercial transaction, the Supreme Court has observed. A Hindu marriage cannot be recognised in the “absence of a valid ceremony” under the Hindu Marriage Act.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109763532,imgsize-778899,width-400,resizemode-4/109763532.jpg"
"India Inc has to deal with 1,536 Acts, 69,233 compliances: Study",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-inc-has-to-deal-with-1536-acts-69233-compliances-study/articleshow/109763236.cms,"BENGALURU: Despite attempts to improve the ease of doing business , India Inc still has to deal with numerous laws and compliances.A research paper released by TeamLease RegTech , a regulatory compliance management firm, finds there are 1,536 Acts and rules , 69,233 compliances, and 6,618 annual filings to comply with. However, each company may not have to contend with all the compliances.That varies depending on the nature of business, geographical location and reach, and employee headcount.It says that a major part of the compliances for corporates is with regard to labour. Labour accounts for 30.1% of the applicable laws and rules, 47% of the compliances, 46% of the filings, and 68% of the provisions that carry clauses for imprisonment.Govt had sought to streamline several labour laws by enacting four labour codes but has failed to implement them, citing lack of support from some states. Most economists have argued that the new labour codes should be among the first set of key reforms that the new govt should implement.The current sets of laws and regulations come with their own set of internal processes with labour consultants seen to be heavily reliant on spreadsheets for data storage and sharing, the paper said.“Currently, the digitalisation of compliance processes is limited to monitoring and administrating regulatory obligations. Automation will enable businesses to reduce both the expense of compliance and the cost of poor compliance,” the report said.TeamLease RegTech pointed out that there is a lot of redundancy and overlap in labour laws.It suggested that companies and govt should start using open APIs so that they can exchange data seamlessly with regulators. “It will allow regulators to publish updates to compliance requirements, which affected businesses can quickly ingest. In addition, using a network of RegTechs, the infrastructure will enable enterprises to complete straight-through filings. Eventually, the grid will eliminate the need to create, maintain, and submit paper documents. It will automatically detect compliance obligation delays, evasions, and leaks,” TeamLease RegTech said.However, one company may not have to contend with all the compliances.

Maldives foreign minister likely to visit India next week,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/maldives-foreign-minister-likely-to-visit-india-next-week/articleshow/109763177.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Maldives foreign minister , Moosa Zameer , is likely to visit India this month, TOI has learnt. Both sides are in touch diplomatically to finalise the dates for Zameer’s visit but official sources suggested it could happen as early as next week.If it happens, it will be the first high-level visit by either side since the Maldives’ pro-China president, Mohamed Muizzu, took office last year, defeating his India-friendly predecessor Ibrahim Solih.India’s ties with the Indian Ocean neighbour have taken repeated hits since then with Muizzu working to limit defence and security cooperation with India, most notably by asking the Indian government to pull out troops operating Indian choppers in the archipelago and by walking out of a bilateral agreement that allowed the Indian Navy to carry out hydrographic surveys in the Maldivian waters.The visit will take place in the middle of the Indian parliamentary elections, making Zameer likely the last high-profile foreign dignitary India will host during PM Narendra Modi’s second term.The visit will also come around the May 10 deadline that Male had set for India to withdraw its troops and replace them with civilians. India reluctantly acquiesced to the demand, keeping in mind the geopolitical importance of the country which is where most of the major Indian Ocean shipping routes pass through and where China has made a dramatic comeback since Muizzu occupied the top office.Muizzu chose China for his first state visit in January, becoming also the first democratically elected Maldivian president to travel to the country before visiting India. He signed a number of agreements with Beijing during his visit and another later for free defence assistance from China.The visit will also follow the Maldives parliamentary elections that saw Muizzu strengthening his hold on power, with his ruling People's National Congress (PNC) winning a super majority in Parliament . The pro-India Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) was reduced to 12 seats in the elections.Zameer may discuss with his counterpart S Jaishankar the possibility of a visit by Muizzu to India later this year. Maldivian officials had earlier claimed they had proposed a visit by Muizzu to India in November, shortly after his oath-taking. He’s also likely to seek leniency from India in the repayment of loans taken by successive Maldivian governments. Muizzu, who wants to “restore” ties with India on the basis of respect for sovereignty, had earlier urged debt relief measures from India for the repayment of “hefty” loans.The 2 countries are also likely to discuss ways to carry forward defence and security cooperation. Muizzu will see in the parliamentary polls outcome a vindication of his decision to oust Indian troops but he has said as president earlier that he will continue to pursue defence cooperation with India on the basis of mutual respect and trust. In an interview to TOI in January, he had said India will continue to play a key role in supporting the Maldives in building the operational readiness of the Maldives National Defence Force.","Moosa Zameer is likely to visit India this month, TOI has learnt.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
"Paul Auster, 'literary superstar' behind 'The New York Trilogy', dies",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/paul-auster-literary-superstar-behind-the-new-york-trilogy-dies/articleshow/109766077.cms,"NEW YORK: Paul Auster , a prolific novelist , memoirist , screenwriter and filmmaker who rose to fame in 1980s with his postmodern reanimation of the noir novel and who endured to become one of the signature New York writers of his generation, died of complications from lung cancer at his home on Tuesday. He was 77.With his hooded eyes, soulful air and leading-man looks, Auster was often described as a ""literary superstar"".Times Literary Supplement of Britain once called him ""one of America's most spectacularly inventive writers."" Though a New Jersey native, he became indelibly linked with the rhythms of his adopted city, which was a character of sorts in much of his work - particularly Brooklyn, where he settled in 1980.His reputation was anything but local, however. He took home several literary prizes in France alone. Auster, who had lived in Paris as a young man, became one of those rare American imports to be embraced by the French as a native son. ""Merely a bestselling author in these parts, Auster is a rock star in Paris,"" New York magazine observed in 2007. In Britain, his 2017 novel, ""4321"", which examined four parallel versions of the early life of its protagonist - as Auster was, a Jewish boy born in Newark in 1947 - was shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize.His career began to take flight in 1982, with his memoir ""The Invention of Solitude"", a haunting rumination on his distant relationship with his recently deceased father. His first novel, ""City of Glass"", was rejected by 17 publishers before it was published by a small press in California in 1985. The book became the first installment in his most celebrated work, ""The New York Trilogy "", three novels later packaged in a single volume. It was listed as one of the 25 most significant New York City novels of the last 100 years in T, NYT's style magazine. The trilogy, which included ""City of Glass,"" ""Ghosts"" and ""The Locked Room, was a postmodern detective saga in which names and identities blur and one protagonist is a private eye named Paul Auster.Writing six hours a day, often seven days a week, he pumped out a new book nearly annually for years. He ultimately published 34 books, accounting for shorter works that were later incorporated into larger books, including 18 novels and several acclaimed memoirs and assorted autobiographical works, along with plays, screenplays and collections of stories, essays and poems.By the 1990s, Auster had set his sights on Hollywood. He wrote several screenplays, some of which he directed. Auster co-directed 1995 ""Blue in the Face"", sprinkled with cameos by a host of stars, including Lou Reed musing on cigarettes, and Madonna delivering a saucy singing telegram. Auster would go on to write and direct ""Lulu on the Bridge"" (1998), about a jazz saxophonist whose life takes a turn when he's hit by a stray bullet at a New York club; and ""The Inner Life of Martin Frost"" (2007), about an author who retreats to a friend's country house for solitude, only to become entranced by a woman there.Auster at times expressed irritation that much of his career had been assessed in relation to ""The New York Trilogy"". ""Even so... I don't think in terms of 'best' or 'worst.' Making art isn't like competing in the Olympics, after all.""","Auster died of complications from lung cancer at his home on Tuesday.

"In jobless Canada, student dreams end in debt and drugs",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/in-jobless-canada-student-dreams-end-in-debt-and-drugs/articleshow/109742538.cms,"When the going gets tough, the young and restless look for a high elsewhere, just to stay afloat. This is the case for numerous students from various regions of India who have gone to Canada in pursuit of education and jobs. The unemployment crisis in the land they once hoped would offer prosperity and success has plunged many students into a perilous spiral of drug and alcohol abuse, alongside heightened levels of depression and a surge in therapy sessions, according to Canada-based counsellors TOI spoke with.The counsellors said students are turning to marijuana and cocaine, hallucinogenic drugs like Ecstasy, and opioids like Fentanyl as a coping mechanism against unemployment-induced stress. They reported a monthly average of five to eight cases over the past few months.One student from Badlapur in Maharashtra, currently in British Columbia’s Burnaby city for a degree in environmental science, said the realisation that even degree-holding seniors were relegated to paid-by-the-hour gig workers drove him to depression.“In my second semester, I saw seniors around me doing ad hoc jobs to get by. It stressed me out, and I started to believe I’d meet a similar fate. I started smoking, then alcohol, and eventually marijuana,” the 25-year-old said.After failing a semester, he sought professional help from a psychologist and is currently undergoing treatment. However, therapy sessions are expensive — each session ranging from Canadian $70 to $150 (Rs 4,249 to Rs 9000-odd) or more.“Earlier, addiction cases were predominantly among students from Punjab, Haryana, and Jharkhand. Now, we see students from Bengal, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Telangana reaching out for help,” said a counsellor of Indian origin practising in Richmond, British Columbia. The counsellors chose to stay anonymous to respect the patient confidentiality agreement.There are currently around 3 lakh Indian students , according to Canadian Bureau for International Education. Many of them take loans, ranging from Rs 20 lakh to Rs 40 lakh on average, to enrol in universities and colleges in Canada. But the transition from campus to corporate life appears bleak as Canada’s unemployment rate stood at 6.1% in March.Still, students find ways to fund their addiction, including deceiving family members back home or working multiple odd jobs. “My former roommate has moved in with four others in a crammed accommodation. He stopped eating either at home or outside, works multiple shifts, and rides a bicycle to faraway locations,” said a 27-year-old in Vancouver. “Drug dealers extend credit, knowing they’d come back for more.”A counsellor from Delta, British Columbia, shared the story of a patient who had moved to Richmond from a town near Kolkata in 2021.“He finished his master’s degree in June 2023. Following that, he worked at a restaurant and a convenience store to cover his expenses. The frustration of being unable to support his family back home led him to recreational drugs,” the counsellor said.His addiction swirled out of control last year. “He stopped eating, left his jobs, and began ingesting drugs regularly. His roommates reached out to his distant cousin, who brought him to me. Since Dec 2023, he has been undergoing rehab,” the counsellor said.Many students are left vulnerable to self-harm. “I’ve had suicidal thoughts over the prospect of being unable to repay my loan. I searched for a job for six months. I couldn’t get one. So, I have moved in with my distant aunt because I can’t afford rent,” said Mahima Chaudhary, a computer science student in Surrey, British Columbia. She has no addiction-related issues, but struggles with stress. “I don’t have the funds for it,” said Mahima on seeking professional help for her mental health. “So, I’m relying on therapy provided by my college counsellor.”",Many students from various regions of India have gone to Canada in pursuit of education and jobs.

But layoffs fell.Monthly job openings are down sharply from a peak of 12.2 million in March 2022 but remain at a high level. Before 2021, they'd never exceeded 8 million — a threshold they have now reached for 37 straight months.The high level of job openings reflects a surprisingly strong US labor market. When the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates in March 2022 to combat a resurgence in inflation, the higher borrowing costs were expected to tip the economy into recession and push up unemployment.Instead, even as the Fed raised its benchmark rate 11 times, the economy kept growing, companies kept hiring and unemployment stayed low, coming in under 4% for 26 straight months — longest such streak since the 1960s. Employers have added a healthy average of 276,000 jobs a month this year — up from last year's 251,000 — and Friday's April jobs report is expected to show they tacked on another 230,000 last month, down but still solid, according to a survey of forecasters by the data firm FactSet.Inflation eased, too — decelerating from a four-decade high 9.1% in June 2022 to 3.5% in March. The combination of falling inflation and enduring economic strength has raised hopes the Fed can manage a so-called soft landing —slowing the economy enough to tame inflation without causing a recession. Some economists have suggested there need be no landing at all: The economy can keep growing steadily as inflation comes down.But progress on inflation has lately stalled. On a month-to-month basis, consumer price increases haven't fallen since October. And on a year-over-year basis, they remain well above the Fed's 2% target.The Fed had signaled that it expects to reverse course and cut rates three times this year. But, given the disappointing inflation numbers, the central bank appears to be in no hurry to start: It's expected to leave rates alone at its meeting Wednesday.","US employers posted 8.5 million vacancies in March, down from 8.8 million in February and the fewest since February 2021.

Einstein Probe X-ray telescope begins observations with breakthrough discoveries,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/einstein-probe-x-ray-telescope-begins-observations-with-breakthrough-discoveries/articleshow/109753335.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Einstein Probe, a joint Chinese and European X-ray telescope mission, has commenced its journey into the cosmos, offering groundbreaking insights into the universe's most dynamic phenomena. Launched on January 9 aboard a Chinese Long March rocket, the Einstein Probe is currently stationed in orbit around Earth at an altitude of 600 kilometers (373 miles) and is undergoing a critical phase of testing and calibration.The telescope's innovative design, inspired by the eyes of lobsters, utilizes a Wide-field X-ray Telescope (WXT) to capture X-rays across a vast expanse of the sky. This lobster-eye approach enables the telescope to observe a panoramic field of view spanning over 3,600 square degrees, or approximately one-eleventh of the sky, in a single shot. Remarkably, WXT can image the entire sky in X-rays within just three orbits, a report in Space.com said.The design, which mimics the way lobsters see, features hundreds of thousands of tiny square pores linked to tubes that focus light through reflection. This unique structure allows the telescope to efficiently capture high-energy X-rays that are difficult to detect with traditional methods due to their powerful nature and tendency to pass through most materials without interaction.Since its launch, the Einstein Probe has successfully detected numerous X-ray transients, which are brief and intense flashes of X-ray light typically associated with highly energetic and transient celestial events. The first such event was captured on February 19, linked to a long gamma-ray burst from the destruction of a massive star. To date, the telescope has discovered an impressive total of 141 transients, including 127 stars unleashing X-ray flares, the Space.com report said.Complementing the WXT is the Follow-up X-ray Telescope (FXT), which provides more detailed views of specific areas or objects within WXT's broad surveillance range. FXT has been actively engaged in follow-up observations, further exploring phenomena detected by WXT. Among its notable observations are detailed images of the supernova remnant Puppis A and the giant globular cluster Omega Centauri, showcasing binary systems where material from a star is being pulled onto a neutron star or black hole.""I am delighted to see the first observations from Einstein Probe, which showcases the mission's ability to study wide expanses of the X-ray sky and quickly discover new celestial sources,"" said Carole Mundell, the European Space Agency’s Director of Science. She emphasized that the early data provide a tantalizing glimpse into the dynamic universe that the mission will further unveil.Erik Kuulkers, the Project Scientist for Einstein Probe at the European Space Agency, expressed his astonishment at the capabilities demonstrated by the instruments, even before full calibration. ""It is astounding that we could already perform a time-critical follow-up observation using the FXT instrument of a fast X-ray transient first spotted by WXT,"" he noted, highlighting the potential of the mission during its planned survey.The mission, set to officially commence its survey in June following the completion of its testing phase, marks a significant advance in X-ray astronomy. It is a collaboration involving the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the European Space Agency, the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics in Germany, and the National Centre for Space Studies in France. The Einstein Probe's discoveries are expected to greatly enrich the catalog of celestial objects for Europe's forthcoming NewAthena mission, poised to be the most powerful X-ray telescope ever built, scheduled for launch in 2037.","The Einstein Probe, a joint Chinese and European X-ray telescope mission, has commenced its journey into the cosmos.

Pakistan is now eyeing a new, longer and larger economic bailout package, but economists cautioned against the country’s continued reliance on overseas financial assistance, warning of potential dire consequences.IMF approved the immediate release of the tranche following a key meeting of the global lender’s executive board in Washington late Monday night.All board members favoured releasing the funds, except India, which abstained.Pakistan has been reeling from a severe economic crisis for more than two years, with its inflation at one point shooting up to nearly 38% and its foreign currency reserves depleted to $3bn in Feb 2023, enough to cover less than five weeks of imports.Last year, the global lender had approved a nine-month standby arrangement with Pakistan “to support its economic stabilisation programme”. The approval had allowed for an immediate disbursement of $1.2bn, with the rest phased over the programme’s duration — subject to two quarterly reviews.The IMF bailout proved important to save the country from default, the state broadcaster quoted PM Sharif as saying.Leading economist Qaiser Bengali expressed scepticism about the perceived stability, highlighting the temporary nature of the current situation and underscoring the necessity of meaningful reforms to address long-term economic challenges.“If the so-called stability was due to a rise in exports or better inflow of dollars, that would have been meaningful, but that is not happening,” Bengali said, adding that the economy cannot run on a policy of getting new loans to pay past loans.Pakistan’s external debt obligations exceed $130 billion, with concerns raised by financial experts regarding the potential inflationary impact of the country’s debt-driven approach to fiscal deficit management.","PM Shehbaz Sharif expressed optimism regarding release of IMF ’s final $1.1 billion tranche of a $3 billion bailout to the country.

"Dar's surprise elevation as deputy PM 'pre-planned', a move to 'compensate' Nawaz Sharif",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/dars-surprise-elevation-as-deputy-pm-pre-planned-a-move-to-compensate-nawaz-sharif/articleshow/109689461.cms,"NEW DELHI: The surprise elevation of Pakistan foreign minister Ishaq Dar - a close confidant of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif - as the deputy prime minister was in reality ""pre-planned' and is reportedly a move to ""compensate' the PML-N supremo for the loss of the finance portfolio, it emerged on Monday. At the age of 73, Dar, a chartered accountant and experienced politician from the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party, was named deputy prime minister by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Sunday, with the appointment taking immediate effect and until further notice.Shehbaz Sharif and Dar are currently in Saudi Arabia for the World Economic Forum's (WEF) special meeting.According to the Dawn newspaper, Dar's new appointment ""took many by surprise, but drew hardly any criticism from its allies'.Dar being ""awarded' the ""rarely filled' slot of deputy prime minister has raised many questions, the report said.The main talking point is that PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif wants to have his ""confidant' in a key position in the federal cabinet to ""compensate him for the loss of the finance portfolio', it said.The report mentioned that the action was also viewed in connection with Nawaz Sharif assuming leadership of the ruling PML-N party as its president, a position he had been deprived of after being convicted in the Panama Papers case.Dar is seen as having a close relationship with Nawaz Sharif because of the family connection through marriage, as his son is married to the elder Sharif's daughter.An insider claimed that the move to appoint Dar as deputy prime minister was ""pre-planned', the report said. During the formation of the coalition government, it was agreed that Dar would serve as the Deputy Prime Minister.However, based on a report from Geo News, the decision to appoint a four-time finance minister as the foreign minister indicates an increased focus on economics in the country's diplomacy as the financially struggling nation aims to obtain another deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and strengthen external financing from foreign capitals.Dar was the finance minister from 1998 to 1999 and then again from March to May 2008. He once more headed the finance ministry from 2013 to 2017 and later from 2022 to 2023. He additionally worked as the minister for industry and investment from February 1997 to July 1997, and also in commerce from December 1997 to October 1999.According to the report from Dawn, during Nawaz Sharif's tenure as the prime minister, Dar served as the de facto deputy prime minister, leading numerous government and parliamentary committees in the capacity of chairperson. Even though the Constitution does not include a provision for a deputy prime minister, Dar is the second legislator to assume this role.Chaudhry Parvez Elahi served as Deputy Prime Minister when the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) was in power from June 25, 2012, to June 29, 2013. During that period, his responsibilities were largely symbolic, and he was given recognition by then-President Asif Ali Zardari for his support of the government led by the PPP.Elahi is currently serving as the president of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party led by the jailed former prime minister Imran Khan, and he is in prison due to corruption allegations.Interestingly, the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), the main ally of the PML-N-led government, did not raise any objection to Dar's new appointment. The PPP Information Secretary, Faisal Karim Kundi, stated that his party had no objections to Dar's appointment as the deputy prime minister. ""It is the PM's prerogative to appoint Dar as deputy prime minister,"" he said, adding that the move was not meant as a ""message' to anyone.Meanwhile, Khan's PTI on Monday reacted strongly to Dar's appointment as the deputy prime minister, saying ""Sharifs are distributing key national posts within the family'.""The Sharif family is distributing important national posts among themselves,"" Special Assistant to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister For Information Barrister Muhammad Ali Saif said.The PTI leader criticized the federal government for appointing individuals to high-ranking positions instead of addressing the problems faced by the people as the Constitution does not provide for the position of deputy PM.Reacting to Dar's appointment, Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency (Pildat) President Ahmed Bilal Mehboob termed the PM Shehbaz Sharif-led government's move ""an extra-constitutional step that carries no substantial value'.""This just indicates intra-party tensions and competition for influence. It is not an admirable step because, at this serious juncture of our national life and the lowest point of our economic condition, we should be focusing on substantive issues rather than taking trivial and inconsequential decisions,"" The News reported quoting Mehboob.(With inputs from agencies)","Ishaq Dar, 73, was named deputy prime minister by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Sunday.

Pakistan: PM Shehbaz Sharif raises wheat procurement target amid farmer protests,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-pm-shehbaz-sharif-raises-wheat-procurement-target-amid-farmer-protests/articleshow/109664872.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has finally responded to farmer protests in his country over delays in the grain's buying process by ordering an increase in the wheat procurement target from USD 1.4 million tonnes to USD 1.8 million tonnes, Dawn reported.Further, Sharif has instructed the Pakistan Agricultural Storage and Services Corporation Limited (Passco), Pakistan's national grain procurement and storage agency, to expedite the buying process to assist growers.According to Dawn, these directives were issued by the Prime Minister before his departure for Saudi Arabia to attend the World Economic Forum meeting, as per a statement from the Prime Minister's Office (PMO).The official press release stated that decision ""a big relief"" for farmers, adding that it was taken following complaints from wheat growers.""The prime minister has taken the initiative keeping in view the problems confronting the growers regarding the sale of wheat,"" it said.In addition to raising the wheat procurement target, Sharif instructed Passco to prioritize transparency and facilitate growers, as per Dawn.A bumper crop output has been projected for this season and wheat threshing has already begun in most parts of Punjab, the largest wheat-producing province in the county.However, farmers raised complaints against the Pakistan Agricultural Storage and Services Corporation Limited that it was not purchasing wheat and flour mills were ""exploiting them"" by offering rates lower than the government-mandated support price for their crops.The Sindh and Balochistan governments have established the support price at (Pakistcurrency) PKR 4,000 per 40kg, while the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab governments have set it at PKR 3,900 per 40kg.Farmers expressed frustration as their production costs have doubled over the past year, yet they are compelled to sell their produce at last year's rates or even lower.This contentious issue has sparked heated debates in both the National and Punjab Assemblies this week.The National Assembly was told that official procurement has slowed as the caretaker government imported wheat despite having a bumper crop.National Food Security Minister Rana Tanveer admitted the decision was ""wrong"", and the prime minister has already ordered an inquiry into it.He added that the ministry would write letters to provincial governments to procure maximum wheat from the farmers.Opposition member Sheikh Waqas Akram warned the government that farmers would be on the streets soon and ""the rulers would not be able to face the brunt"".The farmers have staged protests in several areas and demanded the government increase the support price.Addressing a press conference earlier this month, the Kisan Board Pakistan president, Sardar Zafar Hussain, urged the government to procure at least five million tonnes of wheat in the current season and raise the support to PKR 5,000 per 40kg.He alleged that the government was ""deliberately delaying"" the procurement campaign because of which the prices in the open market were declining.",Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has ordered an increase in the wheat procurement target from USD 1.4 million tonnes to $1.8 million tonnes.

From spring offensive to charm offensive: The Taliban are working to woo tourists to Afghanistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/from-spring-offensive-to-charm-offensive-the-taliban-are-working-to-woo-tourists-to-afghanistan/articleshow/109713887.cms,"KABUL: Around 30 men are crammed into a Kabul classroom, part of the debut student cohort at a Taliban-run institute training tourism and hospitality professionals.It's a motley crew. One student is a model. Another is 17 and has no job history.The students vary in age, education level and professional experience. They're all men - Afghan women are banned from studying beyond sixth grade - and they don't know anything about tourism or hospitality.But they are all eager to promote a different side of Afghanistan . And the Taliban are happy to help.Afghanistan's rulers are pariahs on the global stage, largely because of their restrictions on women and girls. The economy is struggling, infrastructure is poor, and poverty is rife.And yet, foreigners are visiting the country, encouraged by the sharp drop in violence, increased flight connections with hubs like Dubai, and the bragging rights that come with vacationing in an unusual destination. The numbers aren't huge - they never were - but there's a buzz around Afghan tourism.In 2021, there were 691 foreign tourists . In 2022, that figure rose to 2,300. Last year, there were 7,000.Mohammad Saeed, the head of the Tourism Directorate in Kabul, said the biggest foreign visitor market is China because of its proximity and large population. Afghanistan also has advantages over some of its neighbors.""They've told me they don't want to go to Pakistan because it's dangerous and they get attacked. The Japanese have said this to me also,"" Saeed said. ""This is good for us.""But there are disadvantages, too.Visas are difficult and expensive to access. Many countries severed ties with Afghanistan after the Taliban returned to power, and no country recognizes them as the legitimate rulers of the country.Afghan embassies either closed or suspended their operations. There's an ongoing power struggle between Afghanistan's embassies and consulates staffed by people from the former Western-backed administration, and those under the Taliban administration's full control.Saeed concedes there are obstacles for Afghan tourism to develop but said he was working with ministries to overcome them.His ultimate aim is to have a visa on arrival for tourists, but that could be years away. There are problems with the road network, which is half-paved or non-existent in some parts of the country, and airlines largely avoid Afghan airspace.The capital Kabul has the most international flights, but no Afghan airport has direct routes with major tourist markets like China, Europe, or India.Despite the challenges, Saeed wants Afghanistan to become a tourism powerhouse, an ambition that appears to be backed by the Taliban's top leaders.""I have been sent to this department on the instructions of the elders (ministers). They must trust me because they've sent me to this important place.""The students also have aspirations. The model, Ahmed Massoud Talash, wants to learn about Afghanistan's picturesque spots for Instagram posts and its history for media appearances.Business school graduate Samir Ahmadzai wants to open a hotel but thinks he should know more about tourism and hospitality first.""They hear that Afghanistan is backwards, poverty and all about war,"" said Ahmadzai. ""We have 5,000 years of history. There should be a new page of Afghanistan.""Classes include Afghan handicrafts and anthropology basics.An unofficial subject is how to interact with foreign women and how their behavior or habits could clash with local customs and edicts. Examples might be women smoking or eating in public, to mixing freely with men who are not related to them by blood or marriage.The Taliban have imposed a dress code for women and requirements for them to have a male guardian, or mahram, when they travel. Dining alone, traveling alone, and socializing with other women in public have become harder. With gyms closed to women and beauty salons banned, there are fewer places where they can meet outside the home.In a sign that the country is preparing for more overseas visitors, the country's only five-star hotel, the Serena, has reopened its women's spa and salon for foreign females after a monthslong closure.Foreigners must show their passport to access services. Women with ""born in Afghanistan"" on their ID are barred.The restrictions on Afghan women and girls weigh on overseas travel companies, who say they try to focus on the positive aspect of cultural interactions by making donations, supporting local projects or only visiting family-run businesses.Shane Horan, the founder of Rocky Road Travel, said visiting Afghanistan should not be seen as an endorsement of any particular government or political regime.""Ultimately, the goal should be to support responsible tourism practices that contribute positively to the local economy and foster mutual respect and understanding, while also remaining cognizant of the broader political context in Afghanistan.""He said there was no input from authorities about what tour groups saw or did, and that the company worked closely with a women's rights organization in Afghanistan. A percentage of the tour cost went into supporting this organization's programs, Horan added.There are no women at the Institute of Tourism & Hotel Management. The students don't mention it. But an official at the Tourism Directorate does.""It's a heartbreaking situation,"" said the official, who wished to remain anonymous for fear of reprisals. ""Even female family members ask if they can study here. But there was a change in policy with the change in government. The women who were studying before (the takeover) never came back. They never graduated.""","Afghanistan's rulers are pariahs on the global stage, largely because of their restrictions on women and girls. The economy is struggling, infrastructure is poor, and poverty is rife. But foreigners are visiting the country, encouraged by the sharp drop in violence.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109714068,imgsize-1602274,width-400,resizemode-4/109714068.jpg"

MANILA: South and Southeast Asia braced for more extreme heat on Sunday as authorities across the region issued health warnings and residents fled to parks and air-conditioned malls for relief.A wave of exceptionally hot weather has blasted the region over the past week, sending the mercury as high as 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit) and forcing thousands of schools to tell students to stay home.The Philippines announced on Sunday the suspension of in-person classes at all public schools for two days after a record-shattering day of heat in the capital Manila.In Thailand, where at least 30 people have died of heatstroke so far this year, the meteorological department warned of ""severe conditions"" after temperatures in a northern province exceeded 44.1C (111.4F) on Saturday.And in Cambodia, Myanmar, Vietnam, India and Bangladesh, forecasters warned that temperatures could exceed 40C in the coming days as people endured searing heat and stifling humidity.""I dare not go out in the daytime.

She was happy her school was open. But I was tense,"" said Lucky Begum, whose daughter is enrolled at a state-run school in Dhaka.""The heat is too much,"" she told AFP.

To address the basic needs of the Afghan population, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs has requested a budget of USD 3.6 billion, according to Khaama Press.Last month also, the WFP had raised concerns about a significant increase in malnutrition cases, especially among women and children stating that 1.2 million women were reportedly dealing with malnutrition.According to reports from the World Food Programme, a concerning 1.2 million women are currently facing malnutrition throughout the nation. The organization highlights the worsening malnutrition crisis among children in Afghanistan through a touching video on social media.Earlier this month, the UNHCR has described the situation of human rights, specifically focusing on the rights of women and girls, as well as religious and ethnic minorities in Afghanistan, as very ""grave"" and pushed for immediate requirement for humanitarian assistance for the Afghan people to stay alive.Compounding the humanitarian crisis, reports have emerged of forced deportations of Afghan refugees from neighboring countries, including Pakistan, Iran, and Turkey. Upon their return, these refugees encounter numerous challenges, such as a lack of access to essential resources like clean water, shelter, employment opportunities, and healthcare.The humanitarian situation in Afghanistan has significantly deteriorated since August 2021.Many individuals are worried about the limitations on freedoms and human rights violations, particularly towards women, as the Taliban takes back control.The Taliban's policies, which include forbidding women from entering the workforce and from attending school, have exacerbated the already severe humanitarian situations in the nation. As a result of their exclusion from public life, these women's well-being and the general stability of Afghan society have been greatly affected.The United Nations labelled the country as a ""graveyard of girls' hopes"", as per a TOLOnews report.Another contributing factor the humanitarian problem in Afghanistan is said to be the ineffective strategies of the current government in addressing the well-being of the Afghan population.(With inputs from agencies)","The World Food Programme has been providing food and cash assistance to six million people in Afghanistan every month.

"UK to deport 5,700 migrants to Rwanda this year",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-to-deport-5700-migrants-to-rwanda-this-year/articleshow/109729814.cms,"'More to come'

LONDON: The UK expects to deport 5,700 migrants to Rwanda this year, a senior minister said Tuesday, after the government published new details on the controversial plan.The figures come days after the scheme aimed at deterring migrant arrivals on small boats from northern Europe became law following months of parliamentary wrangling .Rwanda has ""in principle"" agreed to accept 5,700 migrants already in the UK, the interior ministry revealed late Monday.Of those, 2,143 ""can be located for detention "" before being flown there, it added.Law enforcement agencies will find the remainder, Health Secretary Victoria Atkins said Tuesday when asked about the 5,700 earmarked for deportation.""The expectation is that we remove that group of people... by the end of the year,"" she told Sky News television.""If somebody doesn't report as they should do... They will be found.""Migrants who arrived in the UK between January 2022 and June last year are liable to have their asylum claims deemed inadmissible and be removed to Rwanda, the interior ministry said.More than 57,000 people arrived on small boats after trying to cross the Channel during this 18-month period, according to official statistics.The figure underlines the scale of the challenge trying to stem irregular arrivals, and the limits of the government's contentious plan to send some of them to Rwanda.Under the scheme -- set to cost UK taxpayers hundreds of millions of pounds -- their asylum claims will be examined by Kigali.If approved, they will be allowed to stay in Rwanda and not return to the UK.Rwanda, home to 13 million people in Africa's Great Lakes region, lays claim to being one of the most stable countries on the continent and has drawn praise for its modern infrastructure.But rights groups accuse veteran President Paul Kagame of ruling in a climate of fear, stifling dissent and free speech.UK lawmakers last week passed the Safety of Rwanda Bill, which compels British judges to regard the nation as a safe third country.It followed a UK Supreme Court ruling last year that said sending migrants on a one-way ticket there was illegal.The new law also gives decision-makers on asylum applications the power to disregard sections of international and domestic human rights law.UK opposition parties, UN agencies and various rights groups have criticised the flagship policy of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's Conservative government.He said last week that deportation flights are expected to begin within 10-12 weeks.Sunak is also trying to reduce what he says are ""unsustainable and unfair levels"" of regular immigration to the UK, after annual net migration -- the difference between the number of people arriving and those leaving -- topped 745,000.His government has introduced various measures, including a 47-percent hike in the minimum salary for skilled work visas and increasing the income required for some family visas, while tightening regulations for students.Home Secretary James Cleverly said Tuesday that the policies were working, hailing a near-80 percent drop in student visa applications in the first three months of the year compared to the same 2023 period.""This does not mark the end of the road in our plan to cut migration, there is more still to come,"" he said.""Ever-spiralling numbers were eroding the British people's confidence in our immigration system, burdening public services and suppressing wages.""Cleverly has said he wants to cut the annual net tally by 300,000.","The UK expects to deport 5,700 migrants to Rwanda this year, a senior minister says.

King Charles III returns to public duties with a trip to a cancer charity,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/king-charles-iii-returns-to-public-duties-with-a-trip-to-a-cancer-charity/articleshow/109724135.cms,"NEW DELHI: King Charles III will resume his public duties on Tuesday by visiting a charity that provides cancer treatment . This marks the start of his well-planned return after being sidelined for three months due to his own cancer diagnosis.The event signifies the king's initial official public appearance since February 6, when Buckingham Palace declared that he would temporarily step back from public responsibilities to concentrate on his therapy for an unspecified form of cancer.It will be the initial of multiple public appearances that Charles will make in the upcoming weeks as he gets ready to host a state visit by the emperor and empress of Japan in June.It is not clear how many of the traditional royal events of the summer, such as the king's formal birthday parade and the horse racing at Royal Ascot, Charles will be able to attend while he continues his treatment. The palace said last week that doctors were ""very encouraged' by the king's progress, but his schedule would be adjusted as needed to protect his recovery.For now, Charles has another chance on Tuesday to increase awareness about the advantages of early detection and treatment of cancer and other health issues, just as he has been doing during his illness.Charles, unlike previous royals, decided to share information about his health when he received treatment for an enlarged prostate and later when he was diagnosed with cancer. This choice helped increase awareness of these health issues.The National Health Service in England stated that the number of individuals seeking guidance on prostate issues surged by 11 times in the weeks following Charles' announcement of undergoing treatment.","King Charles III will resume his public duties on Tuesday by visiting a charity that provides cancer treatment.
