"In Karnataka, freshers lose out as 'repeaters' double",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-karnataka-freshers-lose-out-as-repeaters-double/articleshow/111527686.cms,"BENGALURU:

The number of repeat NEET-UG candidates seeking entry into medical and dental colleges in Karnataka nearly doubled from 28,064 in 2023 to 53,616, reflecting the direction provided by last year’s results when those repeating the test outperformed first-time aspirants.Of the 11,000 MBBS and BDS seats at stake in the state in 2023, repeat candidates filled 7,012.Unlike JEE for technology courses, there is no bar on the number of attempts an aspirant can make to clear NEET. Data suggests strong competition, with nearly 24 candidates for every medical seat.“Repeaters land more seats because they are dedicating more time exclusively to cracking the entrance test ,” said H Prasanna, executive director of the Karnataka Examinations Authority that oversees admission to undergraduate professional courses in the state.The number of students who registered for NEET this year included 11,111 from the 2023 batch and 10,658 who cleared their Class 12 exams in 2022. Two students from 1997, too, appeared for NEET-UG this year, along with aspirants from 1999, 2000 and 2002.Successful repeaters in NEET-UG 2023 included a candidate each from the 2007, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2014 batches. At 4,600, the highest number of repeat candidates to land MBBS or BDS seats were from the 2022 batch. Another 1,640 were from the 2021 batch.“Around 24 lakh students are vying for a lakh seats this year. Writing NEET is becoming like the civil services, and cracking it at first attempt is becoming harder each year. Many bright first-timers lose seats to those who would have spent an extra year or two preparing for the test,” said Sridhar G, founder of a coaching centre that is starting a batch exclusively for repeat candidates.","Of the 11,000 MBBS and BDS seats at stake in the state in 2023, repeat candidates filled 7,012.

"UK general election: AI candidate gets only 179 votes, finishes last",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-general-election-ai-candidate-gets-only-179-votes-finishes-last/articleshow/111508515.cms,"The very first Artificial Intelligence candidate made its debut in the UK General election but failed to impress the voters as it received only 179 votes.Businessman Steve Endacott's AI-generated avatar, AI Steve stood from Brighton Pavilion constituency. Green Party's Sian Berry defeated AI Steve with a margin of over 28,000 votes, according to the data presented by BBC.After winning the election, Berry took her X and said, ""What an incredible night. Thank you, Brighton Pavilion! And a huge thank you to all the volunteers who have worked so hard to earn every single vote we got. I can’t wait to get to Parliament so I can take your all of your voices with me and hold this new Government to account.""Endacott was an independent candidate for the Brighton Pavilion constituency in the southern seaside town. He decided to run due to his frustration with traditional politics. His company, Neural Voice, powers his AI alter ego, which is named ""AI Steve"" on the ballot papers.AI Steve was designed to engage in real-time discussions with locals on various issues including LGBTQ rights, housing, bin collection, and immigration. The AI then proposes policy ideas and asks for suggestions from the community.Earlier, the Electoral Commission, the elections watchdog, clarified that if AI Steve wins, it is Endacott who will serve as the member of parliament, not the AI version of him.Meanwhile, in the UK General elections, Labour Party won a decisive victory on Friday, ending more than a decade in opposition. This electoral success means Labour leader Keir Starmer will become prime minister later in the day.The sweeping win, achieved in Thursday's vote, ousted Conservative leader Rishi Sunak from office and presented Labour with the substantial challenge of revitalizing a stagnant economy and a dispirited nation.","Businessman Steve Endacott's AI-generated avatar, AI Steve stood from Brighton Pavilion constituency.

"Change at 10, Downing Street renews hope of FTA movement",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/change-at-10-downing-street-renews-hope-of-fta-movement/articleshow/111526683.cms,"Top Picks For You 29 new desi MPs elected to House of Commons, set new record

NEW DELHI: Keir Starmer 's election as the next British Prime Minister has renewed hopes of movement on the proposed free trade agreement , where negotiations moved slowly during Rishi Sunak's term, with the Indian side also hoping that his presence in 10, Downing Street will be a buffer against extremist elements who have been engaged in anti-India propaganda.India's relations with the Labour Party suffered a major blow in 2019 after the latter, under its previous leader Jeremy Corbyn, called for self-determination for Kashmiris and also demanded that international observers be allowed to enter the Union Territory, after India revoked J&K's special status. Starmer, however, corrected course by reaffirming commitment to the UK's official position that J&K is a bilateral issue .""Any constitutional issues in India are a matter for the Indian Parliament, and Kashmir is a bilateral issue for India and Pakistan to resolve peacefully,"" Starmer later said, participating in a meeting with Labour Friends of India .Reaching out to the Indian diaspora, with whom he wants to rebuild Labour's relations, Starmer has also assured them there's no place for Hinduphobia in the UK. As a part of his outreach, he has joined Diwali and Holi celebrations in London.""The current leadership has moved ahead but it needs to be seen if those who espoused the cause of extremists were those at the fringe and how they are reined in,"" said Yash Sinha, India's former high commissioner to the UK.After the rift, there are signs of improved ties with the Indian govt remaining in touch with Labour leaders in the run-up to the elections, with the most significant meeting taking place between external affairs minister S Jaishankar and Starmer when the former visited UK in November. Jaishankar said after the meeting that India valued the bipartisan commitment in the UK towards strengthening the relationship.Given Labour's manifesto and the emphasis on security, Sinha also expects greater cooperation on defence, cyber security and the need to keep the Indo-Pacific free and open.""The initial focus will be on domestic issues but when it comes to foreign policy, India will be right on top,"" the diplomat said. And the FTA - where 14 rounds of talks have been held so far with some ticklish issues still on the table - will be a major thrust.""We will seek a new strategic partnership with India, including a free trade agreement, as well as deepening cooperation in areas like security, education, technology and climate change,"" Starmer's party said in the manifesto.But trade experts see a tweak in the UK's negotiating strategy with business visas, social security and steeper cuts in import duty on Scotch being the focus of talks.Tariff cuts on cars and whisky are two issues on which India has not relented and is pressing hard for business visas and permits to allow more software professionals, doctors and nurses to work in the UK.""The Labour Party manifesto focuses on FTA with India and actually wants to expand the FTA to include other areas of cooperation such as new technologies, environment and security. Therefore, there is no reason to be apprehensive on this front. However, under the Scotland section, the party manifesto has references to working to achieve a significant tariff reduction in India through FTA, we hope that the proposed tariff reductions on Scotch meets their expectations. Moreover, there may be some minor tweaking in visas to professionals as well,"" said Ajay Sahai, director general at Fieo, which represents exports.India is hoping to get lower duty access for its garments and footwear, hoping to compete more favourably with competition from Bangladesh, which enjoys a massive tariff advantage due to its least developed country status.""There are two areas on which we need to keep a watch in the talks: one is the Labour Party's approach on social security. We expect a thrust on fintech and investment should intensify,"" said Sachin Chaturvedi, director general at think tank Research and Information System for Developing Countries.","Keir Starmer's election as the next British Prime Minister has renewed hopes of movement on the proposed free trade agreement.

Wanted terrorist hiding in Pak dies of 'cardiac arrest',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/wanted-terrorist-hiding-in-pak-dies-of-cardiac-arrest/articleshow/111525466.cms,"NEW DELHI/JALANDHAR: Pro-Khalistan terrorist Gajinder Singh , wanted in India and hiding in Pakistan for four decades since he hijacked a Delhi-Srinagar Indian Airlines flight in 1981, died at 73 in Lahore after purportedly suffering a cardiac arrest earlier this week.Gajinder, who co-founded the radical Sikh outfit Dal Khalsa and was an anti-India campaigner till his last days, had been put on a list of 20 most-wanted terrorists in 2002.He was cremated Thursday close to a gurdwara in the Pakistani city that harboured him, with his daughter Bikramjit Kaur lighting the pyre, Dal Khalsa functionary Kanwarpal Singh said.On Sept29, 1981, Gajinder and four terrorists hijacked flight IC 423 with 111 passengers and six crew members on board. The hijackers forced the pilots to land the plane in Lahore, from where they negotiated with former external affairs minister K Natwar Singh, who was then India's ambassador to Pakistan, for the release of Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale and several pro-Khalistan terrorists.Gajinder's gang also demanded $5,00,000, threatening to behead the pilots. The hijackers wrapped fruit in newspapers and claimed those were grenades with which they would blow up the aircraft.The hijack drama ended when Pakistani commandos entered the aircraft after diplomatic pressure from India. Although the then Pakistan govt claimed to have incarcerated the hijackers for years, pictures surfaced in 1986 showing them free. Satnam Singh and Tejinderpal Singh, the two who returned to India, were arrested, tried and acquitted.Gajinder travelled to Germany in 1996 but was barred from entering the country due to objections from India. He returned to Pakistan and stayed low for several years.

Scrapping the exam in entirety would seriously jeopardise lakhs of honest candidates…” the Centre said in its affidavit.NTA, too, has taken a similar stand, saying, “the alleged paper leak in Patna... the number of such candidates who have allegedly been helped in this manner against unlawful payment appears to be miniscule”. It further said that action had been taken against all such students and they had been arrested and their results withheld.“Cancellation of the entire examination has apparently and prima facie not arisen, hence the entire examination pan-India involving more than 23 lakh students does not require to be cancelled,” it said.“It is submitted that the present case is not a case wherein the entire examination process conducted across at 4,750 centres in 571 cities, including 14 cities abroad, has suffered systematic failures as it has not been vitiated by all pervasive factors of unfair means or paper leak etc,” it said.Referring to data analysis of results of the students who indulged in unfair means, NTA said that they did not make the mark despite irregularities and “would not be entitled for admission to medical colleges of primary importance”.As the allegations of paper leak and malpractices hit headlines, many students moved Supreme Court seeking direction to the Centre and NTA to quash the examination and conduct fresh tests. More than 100 students have filed petitions and counter petitions were also filed against re-test.","The Centre and NTA concurred that the impact of irregularities/cheating/impersonation/malpractices and paper leak was limited and confined to few centres in Patna and Godhra. “In any examination, there are competing rights that have been created whereby the interests of a large number of students who have taken the examination without adopting any alleged unfair means must not also be jeopardised,” the Centre said in its affidavit.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111526660,imgsize-68636,width-400,resizemode-4/111526660.jpg"

Suspend life term only if trial court clearly erred: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/suspend-life-term-only-if-trial-court-clearly-erred-sc/articleshow/111527417.cms,"NEW DELHI: Distinguishing incarceration for a fixed period from life sentences, the Supreme Court on Friday said constitutional courts would not suspend a convict’s life sentence unless prima facie satisfied that the judgment under appeal is unsustainable.Dealing with the plea of suspension of life sentence in a murder case in which a convict was awarded life term, a vacation bench of Justice J B Pardiwala and Ujjal Bhuyan said, “There is a fine distinction between sentence for a fixed term and life imprisonment.”“If the punishment awarded is for a fixed number of years, the appellate courts may exercise their discretion liberally to suspend the sentences pending adjudication of the convict’s appeal unless the prosecution points out exceptional circumstances to dissuade the court from suspending it,” it said.Recording the general principle of law that presumption of innocence of an accused gets obliterated upon his conviction by a trial court, the bench said, “When it is case of life sentence, the only test to be applied by the appellate court is whether there is anything palpable or apparent on the face of the record based on which the appellate court would form a prima facie opinion that the conviction is unsustainable or the convict has a good chance of succeeding in his appeal.”However, the SC said in such cases, the appellate court is not to re-appreciate evidence. The court’s order recording these observations came in a case from Gujarat. Justices Pardiwala and Bhuyan said as the HC has prima facie found the trial court to have correctly appreciated the evidence, there is little room for the SC to interfere.At this point, senior advocate Rauf Rahim argued that the man had no prior criminal antecedents and that his sentence is required to be suspended as he has to take care of his widowed daughter-in-law who has three minor children. He also informed the court that since the appeal against conviction was filed before the HC last year, there is little chance of it getting decided in the near future.Taking a humanitarian approach, the SC issued notice to Gujarat govt on the convict’s plea for suspension of sentence and posted the matter for hearing after four weeks.","Supreme Court distinguishes incarceration for fixed period from life sentences.

The indigenisation efforts have been pursued aggressively,” it added.Moreover, increasing arms exports have also contributed to the overall growth in defence production.

List of demands revealed: Andhra Pradesh CM Chandrababu Naidu and Telangana CM Revanth Reddy's priorities in talks with PM Modi in Delhi

Telangana CM Revanth Reddy and Andhra Pradesh CM N Chandrababu Naidu list demands in meeting with PM Modi. Reddy asks for defense land, coal block allocation, IIM, and housing. Naidu seeks industrial incentives, funds for projects, and criticizes neglect of key projects by previous administration.

NEW DELHI: Andhra Pradesh govt’s demand for financial assistance from the Centre, including loan restructuring , is meant to tide over a projected deficit of Rs 11,000 crore this year, with the state expecting to have a meagre surplus to deploy for development from next year.The Chandrababu Naidu govt has prepared a blueprint that seeks to revisit almost two dozen direct benefit transfer schemes started by the Jaganmohan Reddy administration and initiate a series of steps to bolster revenue, start capital works and provide assistance to the needy, sources familiar with the discussions with the Centre told TOI.Naidu held a series of meetings, including with finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, defence minister Rajnath Singh and health minister J P Nadda on Friday.“The treasury needs revenue augmentation and release of funds for capital works. The previous govt stopped critical payments and there is an enormous loan burden. It will take five-six months for us to get it in shape and restart the cycle,” said a source, adding that Andhra will pursue central schemes and some of the focus areas of TDP govt.The Naidu administration is projecting that a series of measures will help generate up to Rs 37,000 crore by the fifth year of its tenure which can be deployed for the state’s development.The TDP govt wants to use the cluster near Visakhapatnam, which is close to Odisha, and the area around Karnataka to create industrial hubs with the proposed port in Duggirajupatnam being a crucial element of the plan. Central assistance for the port was promised at the time of bifurcation of Andhra and Telangana a decade ago, but there has not been any progress.","Andhra Pradesh govt’s demand for financial assistance from the Centre, including loan restructuring, is meant to tide over a projected deficit of Rs 11,000 crore this year.

The good show in sowing can be attributed to focus on sowing of less water-consuming crops such as pulses and oilseeds .Though both the years - 2023 and 2024 - reported deficit rainfall in June, the deficit this year (11%) was bigger than the deficit (9%) last year.Nevertheless, acreage of Kharif crops as on June 28 this year was 59 lakh hectares (over 32%) more than the corresponding period of last year.Agriculture ministry ’s acreage data shows that the total sown area in the country as on June 28 was 240 lakh hectares compared to 181 lakh hectares during the same period last year.The higher acreage is mainly due to an increase in sown area of oilseeds by 26 lakh hectares and of pulses by over 14 lakh hectares. On the other hand, the acreage of the most popular Kharif crop, paddy, remained flat at 22 lakh hectares as on June 28 compared to the same period last year.“Since many areas did not receive rainfall in June, farmers preferred to opt for less water-consuming pulses (arhar) and oilseeds (soybean) over water-guzzling paddy. Such smart choices could see higher acreage this June compared to the same month last year,” said an official.Besides pulses and oilseeds, sown areas of cotton also reported higher acreage. The sown area is expected to increase further in July as there is a forecast of ‘above normal’ rainfall for the month and the deficit has already reduced from 11% on June 30 to nearly 2% on July 5.The government has also been focussing on oilseeds and pulses through various interventions including a signal to farmers by approving higher hike in minimum support price (MSP) of oilseeds and pulses compared to paddy.",The country has reported higher acreage of summer-sown Kharif crops in June compared to the corresponding period in 2023.

The loco pilots drive trains over long distances, far from home, and are often pressed into duty without adequate breaks, the sources said.This causes great stress and lapses in concentration which is a major cause of accidents, they added.This has been acknowledged by the Indian Railways in multiple reports, including the recent probe in the accident in Vishakapatnam, they further said.The loco pilots demand a weekly rest of 46 hours, which means a train driver returning home on Friday afternoon will return to duty no later than Sunday morning.The Railways Act 1989 and other rules already provide for 30+16 hours of rest per week, which is not being implemented, the sources alleged, adding that aeroplane pilots also typically get this much rest.According to the party, the loco pilots demanded that two consecutive nights of duty should be followed by one night of rest, and trains should have basic amenities for drivers.The lack of rest is caused by understaffing due to the government halting recruitment of loco pilots, the party sources claimed.""Over the past four years, the Railways Recruitment Board has not recruited even a single loco pilot despite tens of thousands of vacancies,"" a party source claimed.Gandhi assured the loco pilots that he has been consistently raising the issue of ""railways' privatisation and lack of recruitment"", the sources said, adding that the Congress leader listened to their concerns and supported their demand for adequate rest.Gandhi expressed hope that this would significantly reduce accidents.As LoP, he promised to take up their demands with the government, the sources said.Since Gandhi undertook the over 4,000 km Kanyakumari to Kashmir Bharat Jodo Yatra from September 2022 to January 2023, he has held several interactions with a cross-section of society from mechanics to farmers and labourers.Gandhi had met labourers here on Thursday and asserted that providing full rights and respect to those involved in manual labour is the mission of his life. He had met workers at Guru Tegh Bahadur Nagar in Delhi and listened to their problems. Gandhi also did manual labour with them at a construction site.Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra also shared pictures from Rahul Gandhi's interaction with loco pilots.""Loco pilots who run trains in Indian Railways work in very difficult conditions. Long distance trains, long hours of duty, no sleep, no rest, they work under stress and this also leads to accidents. There are more than three lakh vacancies in the railways. Thousands of loco pilot posts are also vacant. The BJP government is not making recruitments,"" she said in a post in Hindi on X.The pilots fear that the Modi government is doing this deliberately with the aim of privatising the railways, she claimed.""Rahul ji assured the loco pilots that he would raise their issue in Parliament as the leader of the Opposition,"" Priyanka Gandhi said.","Gandhi assured them that he would raise their issues in Parliament.

BMRCL: Silk Board Double-Decker Flyover: Commuters Demand Immediate Opening,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/double-decker-flyover-awaits-vip-launch-commuters-irked/articleshow/111443589.cms,"BENGALURU: Commuters facing daily traffic woes at Silk Board junction have one demand: Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Ltd ( BMRCL ) must open to motorists the lower deck of the rail-cum-road double-decker flyover between Ragigudda and Silk Board and three ramps at Silk Board junction without further delay.They argue that if the road infrastructure is ready, there should be no reason for delaying the opening, as formal inauguration by VIPs shouldn’t be a priority.Last year, BMRCL had to drop its plans to formally launch two stations of the Purple Line at Challaghatta and Benniganahalli after public outrage. The stations were operationalised and virtually inaugurated at a later stage.As part of Yellow Line Metro, BMRCL has built a 3km road-cum-rail flyover from Ragigudda to Silk Board. Initially, BMRCL planned to open the road infrastructure to vehicle users by the end of 2023, but the deadline was revised to May 2024 and then pushed to June. It is said the Metro authority is awaiting approval from the central and state govts, both partners in BMRCL, to set a formal opening date.While the lower deck was ready 1.5 years ago, construction of the ramps at Silk Board junction was finished recently. At present, the infrastructure is partially ready to accommodate traffic flow from Ragigudda and BTM Layout side to HSR Layout and Hosur Road. Work to ready the flyover to accommodate traffic flow in the opposite direction will take another year for completion.The alignment of the flyover passes through Jayadeva hospital junction, where the city’s tallest Metro station — providing interchange facilities for the upcoming Yellow and Pink lines — has been built. At Silk Board, BMRCL has built three ramps traversing over a flyover located at the junction. These ramps will allow motorists coming from Ragigudda and BTM Layout to reach HSR Layout (ORR side) and Electronics City (Hosur Road) without stopping at the signal.In 2016-17, BMRCL modified the design of the elevated Metro corridor to accommodate the city’s first double-decker flyover. The road infrastructure has cost Rs 449 crore.Those travelling from Jayanagar and Bannerghatta Road to Silk Board endured daily traffic snarls for years during the construction work. In 2019, BMRCL demolished the Jayadeva flyover to facilitate the work, and traffic diversions were put in place for years.Transport minister Ramalinga Reddy, who also represents BTM Layout assembly constituency, said, “As per the information I have, the road infrastructure is ready. BMRCL is waiting for consent from the ministry of housing and ministry of urban development for its formal inauguration.

Banks on alert! The Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) has cautioned banks across the nation to be vigilant against potential cyberattacks , following credible intelligence reports. Banks have been instructed to actively monitor their systems round the clock to detect any threats.In an advisory issued on June 24, the RBI said, ""In the light of credible threat intelligence received regarding potential cyberattacks, regulated entities are advised to put in place enhanced state of surveillance and resilience capabilities to guard against these threats.""According to an ET report, RBI's communication preceded a social media post suggesting that LulzSec , a group notorious for several high-profile attacks, was targeting Indian banks.The group, which was thought to have become inactive, is said to have resurfaced.Banks are required to continuously monitor network activities and server logs to identify any malicious intrusions. Additionally, they must keep a close watch on critical payment systems, including SWIFT (the messaging system for international fund transfers), card networks (facilitating card payments), and domestic real-time fund transfer frameworks such as RTGS, NEFT, and UPI.RBI has issued a reminder to banks, urging them to implement standard controls to safeguard against threats such as DDoS (distributed denial of service) attacks. These attacks involve hackers launching a coordinated assault on a bank's systems, overwhelming them with a flood of queries that hinder the processing of legitimate customer requests and transactions on the website and online services.In addition to DDoS protection, banks are required to impose restrictions on remote logins and access to critical systems. They must also conduct thorough scans of all information systems to detect viruses and malware, and ensure that the latest patches are installed after necessary testing.Also Read | RBI’s overseas gold reserves drop to 6-year low!

Typically, when there is some hint of a possible cyberattack, banks simultaneously test the efficacy of their continuity and contingency plans. It's the same this time”.The regulatory communication emphasizes the importance of banks having robust offline backup and recovery strategies in place, and testing their effectiveness.The official further stated, ""Given the numerous instances of attacks, some of which may go unreported, authorities and institutions can't take intelligence input lightly.""","The Reserve Bank of India has cautioned banks across the nation to be vigilant against potential cyberattacks.

Budget 2024 Income Tax Expectations : Ahead of the Union Budget 2024 presentation by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, the government is currently evaluating a proposal to raise the tax-deductible limit on interest income from savings accounts to Rs 25,000.This suggestion was put forward by banks during a recent meeting with key officials from the finance ministry.Banks have been advocating for deposit incentives due to increasing concerns about the widening credit-deposit ratio.""It (the suggestion) is under review, and there could be some relief for banks, which have demanded incentives to shore up deposits,"" a government official was quoted as saying in an ET report by Dheeraj Tiwari. The final decision on the proposal will be made closer to the budget announcement.Under the old tax regime, interest income up to Rs 10,000 per year from savings accounts is tax-exempt under Section 80TTA of the Income Tax Act . For senior citizens aged 60 and above, this limit is set at Rs 50,000 and includes interest income from fixed deposits under Section 80 TTB. However, these benefits were removed under the new tax regime, when it was introduced in the 2020 budget.""Both issues, including enhancement of the old limit and allowing interest income earned from savings accounts in scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) under existing regulations in the new regime, are being deliberated,"" said the person cited above, noting that banks had previously made a presentation on this matter.Also Read | Budget 2024 income tax expectations: Top 10 things FM Sitharaman should do for salaried taxpayers The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) observed in its latest Financial Stability Report that households are diversifying their financial savings, allocating more to non-banks and the capital market.The report highlighted that the growing gap is reflected in the rising credit-deposit (C-D) ratio, which peaked at 78.8% in December 2023 before moderating to 76.8% at the end of March.Recently, HDFC Bank, the country's largest private sector lender, reported a 5% sequential decline in its current account-savings account (CASA) deposits to Rs 8.63 lakh crore during the first quarter of the current financial year.","The government is evaluating a proposal to raise the tax-deductible limit on interest income from savings accounts to Rs 25,000.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.",Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class. The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

"Elon Musk argues delay in disclosing Twitter stake was 'unintentional mistake, not fraud'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/elon-musk-argues-delay-in-disclosing-twitter-stake-was-unintentional-mistake-not-fraud/articleshow/111527730.cms,"In a recent filing in Manhattan federal court , X chairman Elon Musk has requested for the dismissal of a lawsuit brought by former Twitter shareholders who allege that Musk delayed revealing his substantial ownership stake in the social media company in early 2022.Musk argued that ""all indications"" point to his delay being an unintentional mistake rather than an attempt to defraud shareholders.The proposed class action lawsuit claims that Musk and his wealth manager, Jared Birchall, were aware of the US Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) rule requiring Musk to disclose his 5% stake in Twitter by March 24, 2022. However, they waited an additional 11 days to do so.The investors argued that this delay allowed Musk to purchase more shares at lower prices, resulting in savings of over $200 million. Following Musk's disclosure of his 9.2% stake on April 4, 2022, Twitter's stock price surged by 27%.In his defense, Musk said that he had planned to disclose his Twitter stake at the end of 2022 but promptly revealed it upon realizing he had misinterpreted the SEC disclosure rule.""This is not a scheme to defraud,"" Musk said. ""All indications--including those in the pleadings--point to mistake.""Musk also refuted the investors' claim that an unnamed Morgan Stanley banker assisted in developing a trading strategy to accumulate Twitter shares without alerting the broader market.Last September, US District Judge Andrew Carter declined to dismiss an earlier version of the lawsuit, citing evidence that Musk understood the SEC disclosure and had testified about it under oath. The case, titled Oklahoma Firefighters Pension and Retirement System v Musk et al, is being heard in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York.","X chairman Elon Musk has requested for the dismissal of a lawsuit brought by former Twitter shareholders.

"Kansas' top court rejects 2 anti-abortion laws, bolstering a state right to abortion access",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/kansas-top-court-rejects-2-anti-abortion-laws-bolstering-a-state-right-to-abortion-access/articleshow/111519697.cms,"TOPEKA: Kansas ' highest court on Friday struck down state laws regulating abortion providers more strictly than other health care professionals and a ban on a common second-trimester procedure, reaffirming its stance that the state constitution protects abortion access.""We stand by our conclusion that section 1 of the Kansas Constitution Bill of Rights protects a fundamental right to personal autonomy, which includes a pregnant person's right to terminate a pregnancy,"" Justice Eric Rosen wrote for the majority in overturning the ban on a certain type of dilation and evacuation, also known as D&E.In striking down the law on clinic regulations, the panel found that the state had failed to meet ""its evidentiary burden to show the Challenged Laws further its interests in protection of maternal health and regulation of the medical profession as it relates to maternal health.""The Kansas Supreme Court 's 5-1 rulings in two separate cases signal that the state's Republican-controlled Legislature faces stricter limits on regulating abortion than GOP lawmakers thought and suggests other restrictions could fall. Lawsuits in lower state courts already are challenging restrictions on medication abortions, a ban on doctors using teleconferences to meet with patients, rules for what doctors must tell patients before an abortion and a requirement that patients wait 24 hours after receiving information about a procedure to terminate their pregnancies.Justice K.J. Wall did not participate in either ruling on Friday while Justice Caleb Stegall was the lone dissenter.In his dissenting opinion in the clinic regulations case, Stegall said the majority's actions will damage the court's legitimacy ""for years to come."" He said that the declaration that the state constitution protects a right to bodily autonomy could affect a ""massive swath"" of health and safety regulations outside abortion, including licensing requirements for barbers.""Surely the government does not have a compelling interest in who trims my beard?"" Stegall wrote. ""Let the lawsuits commence in this new target-rich environment. The majority has - perhaps unwittingly - put the entire administrative state on the chopping block of strict scrutiny.""Stegall, who was appointed by conservative Republican Gov Sam Brownback, is widely regarded as the court's most conservative member.Kansas' top court declared in a 2019 decision that abortion access is a matter of bodily autonomy and a ""fundamental"" right under the state constitution. Voters in August 2022 also decisively rejected a proposed amendment that would have explicitly declared abortion not a fundamental right and allowed state lawmakers to greatly restrict or ban it.Lawyers for the state had urged the justices to walk back the 2019 ruling and uphold the two laws, which hadn't yet been enforced because of the legal battles over them. The state's solicitor general, appointed by Republican Attorney General Kris Kobach, had argued the 2022 vote didn't matter in determining whether the laws could stand.The court disagreed and handed abortion-rights supporters a big legal victory.Kansas has become an outlier among states with Republican-controlled Legislatures since the U.S. Supreme Court issued its Dobbs decision in June 2022, allowing states to ban abortion completely. That's led to an influx of patients from states with more restrictive laws, particularly Oklahoma and Texas. The Guttmacher Institute, which supports abortion rights, projected last month that about 20,000 abortions were performed in Kansas in 2023 or 152% more than in 2020.Kansas doesn't ban most abortions until the 22nd week of pregnancy, but it requires minors obtain the written consent of their parents or a guardian. Other requirements, including the 24-hour waiting period and what a provider must tell patients, have been put on hold. A lower court is considering a challenge to them by providers.Abortion opponents argued ahead of the August 2022 vote that failing to change the state constitution would doom long-standing restrictions enacted under past GOP governors. Kansas saw a flurry of new restrictions under former Republican Gov Sam Brownback from 2011 through 2018.The health and safety rules aimed specifically at abortion providers were enacted in 2011. Supporters said they would protect women's health - though there was no evidence provided then documenting that such rules in other states led to better health outcomes. Providers said the real goal was to force them out of business.The ban on a certain type of D&E procedure performed during the second trimester was the first of its kind when it was enacted in 2015.According to state health department statistics, about 600 D&E procedures were done in Kansas in 2022, accounting for 5% of the state's total abortions. About 88% of the state's abortions occurred in the first trimester. The state has yet to release statistics for 2023.The procedure ban would have forced providers to use alternative methods that the Center for Reproductive Rights, an abortion-rights advocacy group, has said are riskier for the patient and more expensive.The 2019 ruling came in the early stages of the lawsuit over the 2015 ban. The justices kept the law on hold but sent the case back to the trial court to examine the ban further. A trial judge said the law could not stand.Three of the court's seven justices joined the court since the 2019 decision. All three were appointed by Democratic Gov Laura Kelly, a strong abortion-rights supporter, but one of the three - Wall - removed himself from the cases.","The Kansas Supreme Court's 5-1 rulings in two separate cases signal that the state's Republican-controlled Legislature faces stricter limits on regulating abortion than GOP lawmakers thought. Lawsuits in lower state courts already are challenging restrictions on medication abortions, a ban on doctors using teleconferences to meet with patients.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111519750,imgsize-1167392,width-400,resizemode-4/111519750.jpg"

Last year, she managed a winning 39-and-a-half hot dogs in 10 minutes.Sudo’s previous personal best came in 2020 when she chowed down on a whopping 48.5 dogs in the beef-eating competition.With the event's biggest star —- Joey “Jaws” Chestnut — out of the contest this year, Sudo’s result set up a possible scenario in which the women’s champ out-eats the men’s winner. Geoffrey Esper, who came second last year, also has a personal best of 51, but only ate 49 last year.Chestnut, who won 16 out of the previous 17 contests, isn't attending the competition over a sponsorship tiff. Instead, he'll compete against soldiers at a U.S. Army base in El Paso later in the day. That leaves the traditional Brooklyn event wide open for a new winner in the men's division, with eaters from around the world competing on America's Independence Day to see how many hot dogs they can eat in 10 minutes.Thousands of fans flock each year to the event held outside the original Nathan’s location in Brooklyn's Coney Island, a beachfront destination with amusement parks and a carnivalesque summer culture. ESPN is broadcasting the contest live. The men’s will begin at approximately 12:20 p.m.Competitors are coming from over a dozen states and five continents, with prospects from Brazil, Japan, the United Kingdom, South Korea, Australia and the Czech Republic vying for the coveted title and $10,000 prize money.“There's going to be a new champion,” Australian James Webb, who holds a world record for eating 70 doughnuts in eight minutes, said at a preview event in New York on Wednesday.Last year Chestnut, of Indiana, chewed his way to the title by downing 62 dogs and buns in 10 minutes. The record, which he set in 2021, is 76.“I'm going to be pushing myself,” Sudo said Wednesday. Her rival Mayoi Ebihara, from Japan, said through a translator that she would eat until she passes out, with a goal of downing 50 hot dogs.Chestnut was initially disinvited from the event over a sponsorship deal with Impossible Foods, a company that specializes in plant-based meat substitutes.Major League Eating, which organizes the Nathan’s Famous contest, has since said it walked back the ban, but Chestnut decided to spend the holiday with the troops anyway.Chestnut said he wouldn’t return to the Coney Island contest without an apology.(With agency inputs)","Miki Sudo, a Florida native, beat her beef-eating competitors by a mile at the July 4 tradition.

Ra'Ad: Pakistan Arms JF-17 Jets with Ra'ad-I Nuclear Missiles,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-arming-jf-17-jets-with-raad-nuke-missiles/articleshow/111454243.cms,"A recent image captured during rehearsals for the 2023 Pakistan Day Parade has shed light on the potential nuclear capabilities of Pakistan's JF-17 Thunder Block II aircraft. The photograph depicts a JF-17 carrying what appears to be a Ra'ad air-launched cruise missile (ALCM), marking the first public observation of this configuration.Analyzing images of a JF-17 Thunder Block II from the 2023 Pakistan Day Parade rehearsals, the Federation of American Scientists (FAS) confirmed that the fighter jet was equipped with a Ra'ad-I nuclear missile.""Notably, this was the first time such a configuration had been observed in public,"" the FAS said in its report.To determine the specific type of Ra'ad missile in the image, comparisons were made with Ra'ad-I and Ra'ad-II missiles displayed in previous Pakistan Day Parades. While the Ra'ad-II, first unveiled in 2017, was presented as having nearly double the range capability of the Ra'ad-I, external features did not clearly distinguish the two versions until 2022. The latest Ra'ad-II, displayed in 2022 and 2024, features a distinct 'x-shaped' tail fin configuration, while the missile photographed on the JF-17 more closely resembles the 'twin-tail' configuration of the Ra'ad-I, the FAS report said.Using Photoshop's Vanishing Point feature and reference measurements from the vehicles carrying the missiles, the lengths of the Ra'ad-I and Ra'ad-II were estimated to be around 4.9 meters each. The missile on the JF-17 was also measured using the aircraft's length as a reference, resulting in a similar 4.9-meter estimate. These measurements, along with the tail fin configuration, suggest that the missile observed on the JF-17 is likely the Ra'ad-I ALCM rather than the newer Ra'ad-II or the conventional anti-ship variant, Taimoor, the FAS report by Eliana Johns said.The image provides evidence that Pakistan has made significant progress in equipping its JF-17s with the capability to supplement or replace the nuclear strike role of the ageing Mirage III/Vs. However, questions remain about the deployment status of the Ra'ad systems and whether Pakistan will continue to retain a nuclear gravity bomb capability or transition to stand-off cruise missiles exclusively.These developments occur amidst an ongoing nuclear arms competition in the region, with Pakistan, India, and China pursuing advanced technologies such as multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicles (MIRVs). The heightened tensions and the development of short-range, lower-yield nuclear-capable systems by Pakistan have raised concerns about accelerated arms racing and escalation risks in a potential conflict between India and Pakistan.",A recent image captured during rehearsals for the 2023 Pakistan Day Parade has shed light on the potential nuclear capabilities of Pakistan's JF-17 Thunder Block II aircraft. The Federation of American Scientists (FAS) confirmed that the fighter jet was equipped with a Ra'ad-I nuclear missile.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111454376,imgsize-18832,width-400,resizemode-4/111454376.jpg"
'Subway guy': Popular sandwich celebrity Fogle goes from making sandwiches on TV to making them in prison,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/subway-guy-popular-sandwich-celebrity-fogle-goes-from-making-sandwiches-on-tv-to-making-them-in-prison/articleshow/111520226.cms,"In a stunning turn of events in life, a former Subway spokesperson in US has gone from promoting sandwiches on television to making them in prison. Jared Fogle , who is a convicted sex offender and still has almost five years left of his sentence, is placed under arrest at FCI Englewood , a minimum-security federal prison in Colorado, since 2016 after admitting to soliciting sex from a minor and possessing child pornography , New York Post reported.Upon his arrival at the prison, Fogle was assigned to kitchen duty, where he prepared and distributed lunches to fellow inmates. “It was kind of a joke,” said a former inmate.“The Subway guy handing out grilled cheese sandwiches. We used to laugh about it.”Fogle became the face of a highly successful Subway advertising campaign after he claimed to have lost 245 pounds by eating their sandwiches. His success led to lucrative personal appearances and endorsements.However, in 2015, authorities were tipped off about Fogle's involvement in the sexual exploitation of minors.A raid on his home uncovered approximately 400 child pornography videos. Prosecutors revealed that Fogle frequently hired escorts to facilitate access to minors as young as 14 to 15 years old.In August 2015, Fogle pleaded guilty to charges of child pornography and paying for sex with an underage girl after traveling from Indiana to New York City. He was sentenced to 15 years and 8 months in prison.In a 2021 handwritten letter obtained by the Post, Fogle admitted responsibility for his imprisonment.“I really royally screwed up to wind up where I am,” wrote the father of two. “I was selfish and entitled… All I can do is learn from my mistakes to be a better man when I get released in a few years.”Currently, Fogle is indigent, spending less than $300 a month at the prison commissary. No longer represented by his costly legal team, he spends most of his time watching TV, writing letters, or sending emails through the prison’s messaging system, according to former inmates.Over the past eight years, Fogle has held various jobs, including janitorial and groundskeeping roles.Fogle has repeatedly tried to have his sentence reduced, but his attempts have been unsuccessful. He must serve at least 85% of his sentence. The earliest he can be released is March 24, 2029, according to Federal Bureau of Prisons records.","Jared Fogle was sentenced to 15 years and 8 months in prison for soliciting sex from a minor and possessing child pornography.

That compares with $1.29 in Amsterdam, $1.23 in Paris, and $1.08 in Melbourne, according to data collected by Bloomberg.An 18% tax was applied to packaged milk as part of taxation changes approved in the national budget last week. Previously, it was tax-exempt.Before the impost, which resulted in retail prices increasing by as much as 25%, milk costs were comparable with developing countries such as Vietnam and Nigeria, said Muhammad Nasir, a spokesman for the local unit of Dutch dairy producer Royal FrieslandCampina NV.Costlier milk will add to rising inflation in the South Asian country, where wages have stagnated, eroding spending power. The increase may also worsen child health. About 40% of the nation lives in poverty.“It will deny nutrition from a population that is already suffering from malnutrition,” Nasir said in a text message. About 60% of Pakistani children under 5 years suffer anemia and 40% suffer from stunting.Pakistan raised taxes by 40%, the highest on record, in last week’s budget aimed at meeting conditions set by the International Monetary Fund for a new bailout.","Ultra-high temperature, or UHT, milk now costs 370 rupees ($1.33) a liter in supermarkets in Karachi.

Coral bleachings devastate Bali reefs as sea temperatures rise,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/coral-bleachings-devastate-bali-reefs-as-sea-temperatures-rise/articleshow/111505111.cms,"BONDALEM: Indonesian conservationist Nyoman Sugiar to has been working for 16 years to preserve coral on the reefs of Bali, but the frequency of mass coral bleachings he says is now devastating.Ninety percent of the corals Sugiarto had nurtured on the reefs near his village in Bondalem, in northern shore of Bali, lost their colour last December.""It was all white.We were shocked and of course, it also negatively affected the coral we planted. It's not just the natural ones,"" 51-year-old Sugiarto told Reuters.When Sugiarto began coral conservation projects in 2008 he was told that coral could retain the living algae which gives it colour for 10 to 20 years.Yet, the coral reefs off Bondalem were bleached in less than 10 years, he says, blaming warmer sea temperatures triggered by climate change.Coral bleaching occurs when coral expels the colourful algae living in its tissues. Without the algae the coral becomes pale and vulnerable to starvation, disease or death.In April, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said more than 54% of the reef areas in the world's oceans are experiencing bleaching-level heat stress, the fourth global bleaching event in the last three decades.Indonesia has roughly 5.1 million hectares of coral reefs and accounts for 18% of the world's total, data from the country's tourism ministry showed.Coral bleaching in Bali in late 2023 was mainly caused by rising sea temperatures caused by the El Nino phenomenon that hit Indonesia, said Marthen Welly, a marine conservation adviser at the Coral Triangle Center.Indonesia experienced the most severe dry season last year since 2019 due to the El Nino.While Indonesia's corals are more resilient and tend to recover faster, Marthen said it will not be enough to withstand the rising ocean temperature.""It's predicted that the coral bleaching will occur more often, between one or two years with the current temperature,"" he said, quoting the latest research by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and the Australian Institute of Marine Science.However, Sugiarto says he is determined to continue his campaign to conserve corals, and is advocating coral conservation to younger Indonesians and seeking funds to establish a village community to monitor illegal fishing.""We feel that we have the obligation to guard the sustainability of underwater life especially corals,"" he said.",Indonesia has roughly 5.1 million hectares of coral reefs and accounts for 18% of the world's total.

Wickremesinghe responds to critics on Sri Lanka's debt restructuring deal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/wickremesinghe-responds-to-critics-on-sri-lankas-debt-restructuring-deal/articleshow/111427573.cms,"COLMBO: Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe on Tuesday countered the Opposition's criticism of the cash-strapped country's external debt restructuring agreement with major bilateral creditors and promised to table all agreements and documents regarding debt restructuring to a parliamentary panel for scrutiny. The planned two-day debate in Parliament on the deal was, however, postponed as Opposition members protested the lack of transparency regarding the agreements reached.Dismissing the Opposition's criticism as inaccurate, Wickremesinghe argued, ""No bilateral creditor would agree to a reduction of principal amount.Instead, concessions are allowed through extended repayment periods, grace periods and lower interest rates .""The president, who also holds the portfolio as the finance minister, said the agreements with bilateral creditors include extending principal repayments until 2028, maintaining interest rates below 2.1 per cent, and extending the full debt resettlement grace period until 2043.Wickremesinghe said Sri Lanka's external debt now totals USD 37 billion, which includes USD 10.6 billion in bilateral credit and USD 11.7 billion in multilateral credit. The commercial debt is USD 14.7 billion, of which USD 12.5 billion is in sovereign bonds. The debt restructuring, he said, aims at making the debt sustainable, freeing up funds for public services.President Wickremesinghe said he would submit all agreements and documents regarding debt restructuring to the Public Finance Committee of Parliament, emphasising the need for thorough scrutiny and broad attention to the matter, his office posted on X.He said the restructuring of debt was to make it sustainable and would make way for allocating more funds for public services.""The country is now able to secure foreign loans and resume projects that had been halted midway due to lack of foreign funding,"" Wickremesinghe said.Foreign lending to Sri Lanka ceased in April 2022 when the government declared a sovereign default.Wickremesinghe acknowledged the short-term credit assistance provided by India and Bangladesh during that period. ""At that stage we were helped by two friendly nations -- India and Bangladesh -- who gave us short term credit assistance. No other country was permitted to extend long term loans,"" he said.Wickremesinghe assured that all debt restructuring agreements would be presented to Parliament once the ongoing talks with sovereign bond holders concluded.Wickremesinghe's statement was followed by the main opposition leader, Sajith Premadasa, who reiterated that the government has failed to secure the best possible deal in the debt restructuring process.","Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe promises to table all agreements and documents regarding debt restructuring to a parliamentary panel for scrutiny.

She stated that the Taliban authorities were informed that women must be included in public life, despite their refusal to sit across the table with Afghan civil society in this format.The UN-hosted meeting, which began on Sunday, is the third such gathering to be held in Qatar in just over a year, but the first to include the Taliban authorities who regained power in Afghanistan in 2021.The talks were intended to discuss increasing engagement with Afghanistan and a more coordinated response to the country, including economic issues and counter-narcotics efforts. However, the international community has struggled with its approach to the Taliban since their return to power, with no country officially recognizing their government.The Taliban refused an invitation to Doha talks in February, insisting on being the only Afghan representatives, to the exclusion of civil society groups. However, their condition was accepted in the build-up to this latest round. The United States agreed to participate in Monday's talks after receiving assurances that the talks would meaningfully discuss human rights.US representatives ""made clear that the Afghan economy cannot grow while half the population's rights are not respected"", according to State Department spokesman Vedant Patel.DiCarlo, who chaired the UN talks in the Qatari capital, expressed hope that ""there'll be new consideration"" of Taliban government policy on women in public life, including girls' education.The UN and international delegations will have the chance to meet with civil society representatives, including women's rights groups, following the close of the main meetings. However, Amnesty International chief Agnes Callamard criticized the decision to cave in to the Taliban's conditions, stating that it ""would risk legitimising their gender-based institutionalised system of oppression"".The head of the Taliban delegation, spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid, urged diplomats to ""find ways of interaction and understanding rather than confrontation"", despite ""natural"" differences in policy. He also pressed to end sanctions, saying Afghans are ""being ganged up on"".Russia, which has maintained an embassy in Kabul, hinted it could drop its own sanctions, stating that the Taliban are the de facto authorities and must be recognized as such. DiCarlo said the issue of sanctions was raised but not discussed in depth, as it is a member-state issue whether they will continue certain sanctions or not.","The Taliban refused an invitation to Doha talks in February, insisting on being the only Afghan representatives.

The formal announcement of this new alliance is expected soon. “Agreement has been signed between Nepali Congress leader Sher Bahadur Deuba and UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli overnight to form a new government. As per which Oli will lead the government for the next one and a half years and Deuba the remaining time until the election which lies three years ahead,” a senior Nepali Congress leader present at the meeting told news agency ANI.The two parties also agreed on the division of ministries. According to a UML leader, the party leading the government will not get the home ministry. Apart from the central government, the two parties also agreed on the distribution of leadership in various provinces. The CPN-UML will lead the governments in Koshi, Lumbini, and Karnali provinces, while the Congress will lead in Bagmati, Gandaki, and Far-Western provinces. The Madhesh-based parties will head the government in Madhesh Province. The UML leader confirmed, “The party who will be leading the government will not get the Home Ministry has been agreed. Apart from the union government, the CPN-UML will be forming a government in Koshi, Lumbini, and Karnali provinces while the Congress will lead the Bagmati, Gandaki and Far-Western provinces. The Madhesh-based parties will lead the government in Madhesh Province has been agreed between the two leaders.”Additionally, the new alliance has established a committee to suggest amendments to the election procedures and the constitution. The committee is led by former Chief Justice Kalyan Shrestha. The largest and second-largest parties in the parliament also drafted a constitutional amendment agreement, which states that the Vice President would be made the chairman of the National Assembly.Before signing, leaders from the Congress and UML briefed President Ram Chandra Paudel about the coalition change. During their meeting, the leaders informed the President about activating Section 76 (2) to form a new government if the incumbent Prime Minister, Prachanda, failed to take a vote of confidence after UML withdrew its support.Prachanda, who came to power after the 2022 general elections and has tested the floor of parliament four times, must now seek a new vote of confidence. There has been no immediate reaction from the Maoist Center, led by Prachanda, regarding the change in coalition. However, during Monday's cabinet meeting, Dahal assured the ministers that the current alliance would remain intact.The minister for communication and information technology Rekha Sharma, quoting Dahal, said, “The reports in the media are just rumors. We are still in dialogue with our coalition partners.” “The Prime Minister briefed us on the internal situation and dismissed external rumors. There are concerns about what will happen to this government, but there will be no changes. Some want this coalition to be short-lived, but we are determined to keep this government stable for a long time,” she added.Earlier on March 4, Prachanda revived a coalition with the CPN-UML, surprising the largest coalition partner, Nepali Congress. A new coalition, including the CPN-UML, CPN-Maoist Center, Rastriya Swatantra Party, and Janata Samajwadi Party, was initially formed. However, the Nepali Congress formally withdrew its support the following day, activating Article 100 Sub-section (2). According to this article, a Prime Minister is required to secure the threshold of 50 percent, which is 138 votes as per the present number of parliamentarians.As a result of the coalition split, the Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal also left the government and joined the opposition. Pushpa Kamal Dahal came to power in December 2022 by aligning with arch-rival CPN-UML, after previously forging an alliance with the Nepali Congress for the November 2022 election.The vote of confidence on January 10, 2023, saw extensive support for Dahal, with 268 out of 270 present parliamentarians voting in favor, marking the highest percentage in the known history of the Nepali parliament since the establishment of democracy. However, within three months, Dahal realigned with the Nepali Congress, securing a majority in the vote of confidence on March 20, 2023. In this second vote, Dahal received 172 votes out of 262 lawmakers present, with 89 votes against him, while one abstained.","The Nepali Congress and the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) ( CPN-UML ) struck a deal to form a new coalition government.
