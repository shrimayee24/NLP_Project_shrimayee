Amit Shah inspects Bru package rollout; gets feedback from Brus at their village in Tripura,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/amit-shah-inspects-bru-package-rollout-gets-feedback-from-brus-at-their-village-in-tripura/articleshow/116581163.cms,"DHALAI: “Are you receiving 35 kg rations per family….and do you check if it’s actually 35 kg?” “Have all of you received your Ayushman scheme cards?”. “Does the school in your settlement here have teachers?” Home minister Amit Shah, here on Sunday to visit a Bru village in Bruha Para, put these queries to members of the Bru-Reang community now resettled in Tripura as part a quadripartite agreement signed in 2020.The purpose was to take stock of the status of implementation of the resettlement package offered to Brus as part of the 2020 agreement among the Centre, Mizoram govt, Tripura govt and Bru-Reang organisations. The pact provided for permanent settlement and rehabilitation of 6,958 Bru-Reang families, comprising around 38,000 people, in Tripura, almost 25 years after they were displaced from Mizoram due to ethnic violence between the Mizo and Bru-Reang communities.As the interaction between the home minister and Brus saw the latter appreciating the Govt of India for keeping its promises regarding housing, free ration supplies, schools, skill building and medical care etc, Shah said: “I am happier than you all are…Prime Minister Narendra Modi too is happy that he could ensure your permanent settlement in Tripura”.The frank exchange between the home minister and Brus on Sunday also brought out a few areas with scope for improvement. Shah directed the accompanying officials to address the grievances and issues raised by the community members without any delay.For instance, a community member told Shah that the 35 kg ceiling for rations per family was falling short for her 10-member household. “Why is there one ration card for a large family? As per the criteria adopted by govt of India, should it not be 35 kg or 5 kg per person in a large household?” he asked the officials. “Where is the PDS shop in charge? Call him. This should be corrected today itself,” Shah insisted.Tripura chief minister Manik Saha later told TOI that these gaps were being suitably tackled.Similarly, when the Bru members — a riot of colours in their traditional attire — replied in the negative to the home minister’s query on whether they all had Ayushman or CM Aarogya cards, both of which entitle them to free treatment up to Rs 5 lakh, promptly came his next instruction to the officers: “Issue the remaining cards in the next 2 days”.A demand was raised by a woman community member to upgrade the school inaugurated within their relief camp, to Class 12th from Class VIII currently. As regards the demand for creating jobs for members of the community, Shah suggested that rather than waiting for jobs that are scarce, the skills and livelihood opportunities being imparted to them as part of the settlement package, should be used for self employment.He said 25 new skills have been identified in which the Bru-Reang members will be trained and can take up self-employment and livelihood opportunities. These include dairy farming that will allow them to retain the profit, floriculture, beekeeping, handicrafts and millets farming, said Shah.Asked about the status of their voting rights in Tripura, now their permanent home, the Brus happily updated Shah that they had voted in both in the Lok Sabha and assembly polls. “You must vote for BJP,” he said with a smile.For Shah, it was instant connection with the Bru settlers as he broke security protocol to freely walk into their homes, constructed over 1200 sq ft area with Rs 1.5 lakh offered under the settlement package. He inspected the Aarogya Ayushman Mandir (a local health centre), anganwadi, vegetable market, PDS shop and handicrafts outlet and talked to Brus as he went around the settlement. The resident Bru-Reang community members could be seen clicking his pictures on their mobiles and chanting ‘Bharat Mata ki Jai’.Bru resettlement colonies, as part of the 2020 agreement, have been established at a dozen locations in Tripura — spread across North Tripura, Dhalai, Gomati and South Tripura districts — out of which nine locations are on forest land and three on government land.","Home minister Amit Shah visited Bru village in Bruha Para, Tripura.

CLAT '25 admission list delayed after HC order,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/clat-25-admission-list-delayed-after-hc-order/articleshow/116579080.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Consortium of National Law Universities (NLUs) has delayed the release of first admission list for Common Law Admission Test (CLAT) 2025, originally scheduled for Dec 26, 2024. The decision follows Delhi HC's directive to revise the merit list after discrepancies were identified in the final answer key for the undergraduate examination.Candidates were informed of the delay via SMS, with the Consortium assuring them of its commitment to transparency and fairness. Legal experts are reportedly being consulted to address the implications of the revised marking scheme and its impact on rankings.This marks another instance of national-level entrance exams coming under scrutiny. Earlier this year, NEET-UG, CUET-UG and UGC-NET results were delayed amid controversies, involving technical glitches, improper evaluations, and errors in question papers.The CLAT 2025 controversy began with a writ petition that flagged errors in two questions from Set A of the exam paper. Delhi HC upheld the petitioner's claims for one question, directing that marks be awarded to all candidates who selected the correct option as determined by the court. For another question, found to contain blatant errors, the court ruled it invalid and ordered its exclusion from evaluation. Justice Jyoti Singh, while delivering the judgment, emphasised the importance of academic integrity, stating that judicial intervention was necessary to address such lapses and protect the fairness of the admission process.The petitioner also contested other questions, highlighting inconsistencies in evaluation and transparency. Although the Consortium had addressed objections to three questions during its initial review, unresolved concerns prompted the petitioner to demand a Grievance Redressal Committee. A formal representation was submitted on Dec 9, 2024, calling for a comprehensive reassessment of marks and rankings.In its message to candidates, the Consortium stated, ""We acknowledge that this development may create some uncertainty, and we assure you that the Consortium is committed to ensuring transparency and fairness in the process. Consequently, the release of the first admission list for NLUs, originally scheduled for Dec 26, is likely to be delayed.""","First admission list for Common Law Admission Test (CLAT) 2025, originally scheduled for Dec 26, 2024.

No BNS test for those who failed in IPC exam: HC to law university,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-bns-test-for-those-who-failed-in-ipc-exam-hc-to-law-university/articleshow/116578675.cms,"BENGALURU: Karnataka high court has directed Karnataka State Law University to conduct examination for repeater-students who had Indian Penal Code (IPC) as subject, and not insist on taking up Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS). Justice Suraj Govindaraj gave this direction recently while quashing the Dec 6 notification issued by the university.Two students - one from Shivamogga and the other from Bengaluru city - approached HC , challenging the notification and seeking a directive to the university to conduct the exam for IPC - not BNS - for repeaters who had failed in IPC and were reappearing for the subject.The petitioners argued that since they had studied IPC and were unsuccessful in the examination, they cannot be asked to take up the supplementary examination in BNS as they never attended any class related to the new code.On the other hand, the university claimed that with IPC repeal and implementation of BNS from July 1 this year, the examination cannot be held on the repealed code.Justice Govindaraj said the university's argument would be applicable to students who currently or in the future take up BNS as a subject. ""It cannot be expected students who studied IPC take up the examination for BNS, which has never been taught to them in the course structure,"" the judge added.","Karnataka high court quashes notification issued by Karnataka State Law University.

Crippling IAF gaps force government to set up panel for new road map,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/crippling-iaf-gaps-force-government-to-set-up-panel-for-new-road-map/articleshow/116576095.cms,"NEW DELHI: With the IAF grappling with an acute shortage of fighter aircraft as well as force-multipliers, the govt has constituted a high-level committee under defence secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh to chalk out a roadmap to plug the major operational gaps in the force.The committee will examine the IAF's overall capability development through several indigenous design and development as well as direct acquisition projects. ""Among the three Services, IAF has the most critical capability voids. The committee will submit its report by the end of Jan,"" a source said.DRDO chief Samir V Kamat, secretary (defence production) Sanjeev Kumar and IAF deputy chief Air Marshal Tejinder Singh, among others, are the members of the committee.The need to fast-track projects has been reinforced by the way the Chinese air force has deployed additional fighters, bombers, reconnaissance aircraft and drones at all its airbases facing India, like Hotan, Kashgar, Gargunsa, Shigatse, Bangda, Nyingchi and Hoping, after upgrading them with new runways, hardened shelters, fuel and ammunition storage facilities.With the IAF currently making do with just 30 fighter squadrons when 42.5 are authorised to tackle the threat from China and Pakistan, one of the major challenges before the committee will be to break the logjam over the long-pending project to manufacture 114 new 4.5-generation fighters, at an initial estimate of Rs 1.25 lakh crore, with foreign collaboration. ""Some jets will be directly acquired, while the bulk will be produced in India,"" a source said.Then, there is also the induction of indigenous Tejas Mark-1A fighters, which has taken a hit primarily because of the continuing delay in supply of engines by US major General Electric.Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) will be able to deliver only two to three Tejas Mark-1A fighters instead of 16 promised to the IAF in the 2024-25 fiscal, under the Rs 46,898 crore deal for 83 such single-engine jets inked in Feb 2021. The order for another 97 TejasMark-1A fighters for Rs 67,000 crore is also in the pipeline.Meanwhile, GE has promised to begin the deliveries of the contracted 99 GE-F404 turbofan jet engines by March 2025 now, around two years behind schedule.HAL and GE, of course, are now also conducting the final techno-commercial negotiations for co-production of the more powerful GE-F414 aero-engines in India for the planned induction of at least 108 Tejas Mark-II fighters, with 80% transfer of technology for around $1 billion.Induction of force-multipliers is also crucial. IAF, for instance, has just six IL-78 mid-air refuelers, inducted in 2003-04, when it requires at least 18 such aircraft to extend the operational range of its fighter jets.In the ""eyes in the sky"" arena, India is even behind Pakistan, let alone China. IAF has just three indigenous 'Netra' airborne early-warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft, apart from the three Israeli Phalcon AWACS inducted in 2009-11. Consequently, the plan to develop six Mark-1A and six Mark-2 versions of the Netra aircraft also needs to be fast-tracked.","The committee will examine the IAF's overall capability development through several indigenous design and development as well as direct acquisition projects.

Ayushman driving big gains in cancer treatment: Lancet,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ayushman-driving-big-gains-in-cancer-treatment-lancet/articleshow/116577359.cms,"NEW DELHI: Odds of timely initiation of treatment of cancer patients in India have gone up by nearly 36% in the past six years, a new study claimed. It credited Ayushman Bharat-PM Jan Arogya Yojana (AB-PMJAY) for this change. Treatment initiation is considered timely if it starts within 30 days of diagnosis of the disease.According to the study published in The Lancet Regional Health - Southeast Asia, which investigated treatment history of 6,695 patients undergoing cancer treatment at seven major hospitals in the country, most received treatment in 20 days. There were few instances of people getting treatment in two months from cancer diagnosis.As compared to patients who were diagnosed between 1995 and 2017, those diagnosed after 2018 had 36% higher odds of timely initiation of treatment, the study found.AB-PMJAY, a central health scheme, was launched in 2018 to provide an annual health cover of Rs 5 lakh per family for secondary and tertiary care hospitalisation to the poor and vulnerable families. Recently, govt extended the scope of the scheme to all senior citizens aged 70 years and above, regardless of their income.The study claims while access for timely treatment initiation has increased by 30% for those who are not enrolled under the health scheme, it has increased by 90% for AB-PMJAY beneficiaries.The study, led by Dr Prinja Shankar from PGIMER-Chandigarh, was funded by department of health research, health ministry. Poor education, lower socio-economic status, socio-cultural belief, gender, distance from healthcare facility, and access to appropriate financial protection such as insurance are key factors for delayed treatment, the researchers pointed out in the Lancet study. Each of these place the poor and vulnerable at a disadvantage, they added.A NHA official said AB-PMJAY has helped bridge the gap to some extent. ""Now, the poor don't have to think about the cost as they have assurance of treatment up to Rs 5 lakh,"" the official added. AB-PMJAY comprises 557 health benefits packages for cancer treatment.The Lancet study found that cancer patients who required radiotherapy faced maximum delay in the initiation of treatment. In most high-income countries, there is at least one radiotherapy unit available for every 2,50,000 people. This, on an average, would mean 4 radiotherapy machines per million population. The study said applying this factor to India would translate into requirement of 5,000 radiation therapy units when there are less than 1,000 such units, a shortfall of over 4,000 machines.The researchers have recommended that govt should increase infrastructure for radiotherapy, promote local production of quality equipment like linear accelerators and provide affordable and equitable radiation treatment by rationalising the existing health benefit packages pertaining to radiotherapy under AB-PMJAY.As unknown cancer stage has also been observed as a determinant of delayed timely initiation of treatment, so there should be more focus on increasing population coverage under screening programmes, they added.",Treatment initiation is considered timely if it starts within 30 days of diagnosis. Ayushman Bharat-PM Jan Arogya Yojana (AB-PMJAY) was launched in 2018 to provide an annual health cover of Rs 5 lakh per family.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116577401,imgsize-486241,width-400,resizemode-4/116577401.jpg"

What is the Pegasus controversy?

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Randeep Singh Surjewala on Sunday, highlighting the recent verdict by a US court in a Pegasus case, asked if the Supreme Court would carry out a further inquiry into the alleged use of software to illegally hack the devices.On Friday, a US judge ruled against Israel's NSO Group , holding it responsible for hacking WhatsApp and breaching its contract. The lawsuit accused NSO of exploiting a flaw in WhatsApp to install spyware called Pegasus. The case will now proceed to trial to determine the damages NSO must pay.Surjewala, citing the US ruling, claimed that 300 WhatsApp numbers of Indians were targeted.""The Pegasus spyware case verdict proves how 300 WhatsApp numbers of Indians were targeted in the illegal spyware racket,"" Surjewala said in a post on X.The Congress's Rajya Sabha MP further said it was time for the central government to disclose the 300 names targeted through the spyware.""Who are the two Union ministers? Who are the three opposition leaders? Who is the constitutional authority? Who are the journalists? Who are the business persons? What information was retrieved by the BJP government and agencies? How was it used - misused and to what consequence?"" the Congress leader asked.Surjewala further said: ""Will the Supreme Court take note of the judgment of the US court in Meta v/s NSO ? Will the Supreme Court proceed to make public the report of the Committee of Technical Experts on Pegasus Spyware, submitted to it in 2021-22?""The Congress leader asked if the top court, considering the US verdict, would direct Meta to submit 300 names to put Pegasus case to a conclusive end.""Will the Supreme Court now ask Meta to submit to itself the 300 names to meet the ends of justice in the Pegasus case?"" Surjewala asked.""Shouldn't Facebook (now Meta) now have a responsibility to release the names of 300 Indians targeted by Pegasus, considering WhatsApp and Facebook have the biggest subscriber base in India and they have a 'duty of care and disclosure' to its clients in India?"" he further said.The high-profile Pegasus snooping scandal brought the hot-button issue of state surveillance back into focus in India in 2021. The issue blew up after an investigation by an international media consortium under the Pegasus Project revealed that thousands of phone numbers were allegedly targeted by the Pegasus spyware created by NSO Group, an Israeli software company.Several prominent Indians, including Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, Union ministers Ashwini Vaishnaw and Pralhad Patel, poll-strategist-turned-politician Prashant Kishor, were said to be potential targets of the spyware.The issue led to multiple disruptions in Parliament sessions then, with opposition members causing a ruckus in both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha.Later, the Supreme Court said its technical expert committee, after months of forensic scrutiny, could not find Pegasus spyware in the 29 mobile phones of complainants, but detected malware in five of them.","Congress leader Randeep Singh Surjewala asked if the Supreme Court would carry out a further inquiry into the alleged use of software to illegally hack devices.

"TB patients spend up to Rs 32,000 despite free care under government schemes: Report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tb-patients-spend-up-to-rs-32000-despite-free-care-under-government-schemes-report/articleshow/116577513.cms,"NEW DELHI: A new research has revealed that a person with TB in India spends, on average, close to Rs 32,000 during treatment. While some of the costs incurred out of the patient's pocket are direct, such as those spent on diagnosis or hospitalisation, the rest are indirect, for example, costs incurred due to loss of wages.Despite free diagnosis and care under National TB Elimination Programme (NTEP), research conducted by leading experts from Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR), TB support network of WHO country office for India, and Central TB Division shows that patients incur high costs, primarily due to lost productivity and hospitalisation.The researchers measured cost of treatment of over 1,400 TB patients notified under NTEP between May 2022 and Feb 2023. Catastrophic costs were defined as expenditure on TB care being more than 20% of annual household income.According to results published in Global Health Research and Policy (GHRP) journal, the median of total costs of TB care among the study participants was Rs 32,000 (approx). ""Catastrophic costs, experienced by 45% of persons with TB, affected the poor mostly,"" the study found.Enabling early notification of TB, expanding coverage of health insurance schemes to include persons with TB, and implementing TB sensitive strategies to address social determinants of TB may significantly reduce catastrophic costs incurred by patients, the researchers pointed out.Though TB diagnosis and treatment is free of cost under NTEP, persons with TB incur loss of wages and experience loss of productivity both due to periods of absence from paid work, visits to health facilities for diagnosis, drug collection or follow-up investigations which amounts to non-direct costs.Direct costs, the researchers pointed out, are incurred mostly before diagnosis or during hospitalisation for TB diagnosis or treatment. ""Several health facility visits are made before a person with presumptive TB is diagnosed with TB, with longer pre-diagnosis period leading to higher expenditure,"" says the study.","A person with TB in India spends, on average, close to Rs 32,000 during treatment.

He said that while just 2.5% households in the state had access to drinking water before 2018, now 85% had tap water. ""Earlier, no poor person received free ration, but today, under Modi govt, 82% of the people in Tripura receive 5 kg of rice for free,"" he said.Shah, who laid the foundation stone for development projects worth Rs 668 crore in Dhalai district, said the Modi govt was covering full healthcare expenses for 80% of the people in Tripura, subject to a ceiling of Rs 5 lakh.He said Tripura was now attracting investments, with better road network and electrified households with toilets.

He said thanks to the Bru agreement helmed by the Centre with Mizoram govt, Tripura govt and Bru-Reang groups as the signatories, 40,000 people displaced from Mizoram due to ethnic violence were resettled.The Modi govt had also resettled 11 villages at a cost of Rs 900 crore, Shah said.

Forest cover of eight mountain states down in 2 years: Government report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/forest-cover-of-eight-mountain-states-down-in-2-years-government-report/articleshow/116576551.cms,"Some districts in Mizoram, J&K, HP, Karnataka saw green cover rise



DEHRADUN: The latest India State of Forest Report (ISFR), which provides an assessment of the country's green cover situation, has revealed a decline in forest cover in eight mountain states over the period between 2021 and 2023, with several northeastern states on the list.Tripura recorded the largest loss of 95.3 sq km, followed by Arunachal Pradesh (-91 sq km), Assam (-79 sq km), Manipur (-54.8 sq km), Nagaland (-51.9 sq km), Meghalaya (-30 sq km), Uttarakhand (-22 sq km) and West Bengal (-2.4 sq km). ISFR further shows that in Uttarakhand, the decline of 22.9 sq km includes forest cover of Corbett, Rajaji and Kedarnath forest divisions, among other 21 forest divisions that saw a dip in forest cover in two years.The report prepared by the Dehradun-based Forest Survey of India, while explaining the significance of forest cover for mountain districts, stated: “Forests in hill areas act as natural barriers to soil erosion and landslides as their root systems bind soil. They support biodiversity, sustain water sources and regulate microclimates. Besides providing environmental benefits, these forests impact local livelihoods and traditions.”Kumaon-based historian, environmentalist and Padma Shri awardee Shekhar Pathak, told TOI: “The Forest Policy of 1952 or The Forest (Conservation) Act of 1980 mentioned that all the mountain states should have at least 66% forest cover while other states should have 33% forests. But these laws have been diluted over the years, resulting in reduced forests in the ecologically- sensitive mountain states.”Pathak added: “In both Himalayan and Western Ghats, natural ecosystems are fragile. And due to rising extremities of climate change, rapid urbanisation of mountains and increasing calamities, in the event of natural or man-made disasters, the destruction would be manifold. A new phenomenon of urban landslides can be seen everywhere — whether it is Shimla and Nainital or Darjeeling and Gangtok.”“The entire belt of forests from Kashmir to Mizoram is uniquely sensitive alongside its fragile geological and tectonic diversity, apart from different climatic zones which thrive on forests, and need protection from felling,” Pathak cautioned. It is not all gloomy for the hill districts in the country though. Some hill districts in a few states, including Himalayan and coastal states and UTs, registered “gains in forest cover of 234 sq km”. These include Mizoram (241.7 sq km), J&K (83.5 sq km), HP (54.7 sq km), and Karnataka (54.68 sq km). Notably, the biennial report analysed forest cover across 172 mountain districts in 17 states and UTs","Tripura recorded the largest loss of 95.3 sq km, followed by Arunachal Pradesh (-91 sq km), Assam (-79 sq km) and Nagaland (-51.9 sq km).

The US government supported India's request to extradite Tahawwur Rana, a suspect in the 2008 Mumbai attacks . The government called upon the top US court to reject ""the petition for a writ of certiorari"" submitted by Rana.Rana, a Canadian citizen of Pakistani origin, recently petitioned the Supreme Court to block his extradition. The US Solicitor General, Elizabeth B. Prelogar , filed a response on December 16 urging the court to deny the petition.Rana had previously appealed his extradition in lower courts, including the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco, but was unsuccessful. ""The (India US Extradition) Treaty permits Rana's extradition,"" the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit had ruled in August.He then filed a ""petition for a writ of certiorari"" with the Supreme Court on November 13. This petition represents Rana’s final legal attempt to avoid extradition.A writ of certiorari is a request to a higher court to review a lower court's ruling. The term ""certiorari"" comes from Law Latin, meaning ""to be more fully informed.""Rana's ""petition for a writ of certiorari to review the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit"" contends that he was previously tried and cleared in the federal court of Northern District of Illinois (Chicago) regarding the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attack. His petition states, ""India now seeks to extradite him for trial on charges based on the identical conduct at issue in the Chicago case.""However, Prelogar argued that Rana is not exempt from extradition. She contends that the Indian charges against Rana are not fully identical to the charges he faced in a US federal court in Chicago. ""The government does not concede that all of the conduct on which India seeks extradition was covered by the government's prosecution in this case. For example, India's forgery charges are based in part on conduct that was not charged in the United States: petitioner's use of false information in an application to formally open a branch office of the Immigration Law Centre submitted to the Reserve Bank of India,"" she said as quoted by news agency PTI.She further explained that the prior US case against Rana, which resulted in an acquittal on some charges, does not cover all the conduct India intends to prosecute. ""It is not clear that the jury's verdict in this case - which involves conspiracy charges and was somewhat difficult to parse - means that he has been 'convicted or acquitted' on all of the specific conduct that India has charged.""","Tahawwur Rana is a suspect in the 2008 Mumbai attacks.

Did lawyers make a wrong decision in not fighting extradition?



Luigi Mangione's lead attorney Karen Friedman Agnifilo has spoken about not seeking a bail as Luigi Mangione the accused killer of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was present in a court in Manhattan Thursday after Mangione was extradited from Pennsylvania to New York. Mangione did not challenge the extradition indicating that his lawyers were prepared to fight in New York where he had been charged with first and second-degree murder.But Agnifilo did not apply for bail when Mangione was presented in the court in New York because by that time federal murder charges were imposed on her client. Agnifilo who appeared in the court relying on crutches told the court that she was blindsided by the federal charges as she never encountered something like this in her career of over three decades.Agnifilo said that Mangione was being charged with two separate crimes and the charges are very different.""These seem like two different cases,"" she said. ""The theory of the murder charge of the Manhattan DA case is terrorism and intimidating a group of people. This is stalking an individual.""""Is there one case, two cases, two investigations? Is there a joint investigation?"" Agnifilo asked Judge Kahterarine Parker. ""Frankly, I've never seen anything like that and what's happening here,"" she added. ""This is a highly unusual situation that we find ourselves in.""Mangione's next date of court appearance has been fixed on January 18, 2025.Luigi Mangione's Pennsylvania lawyer Thomas Dicky advised Mangione not to fight the extradition and to face the charges in New York. Explaining his decision, Dicky earlier said that facing the charges in New York was inevitable and hence they decided to focus on the main charges against Mangione instead of getting caught up in the procedural legalities. But at that time, Mangione's legal team did not have any idea that Mangione would be charged with federal murder.",Luigi Mangione's lawyer said she was blindsided by the spate of federal charges against her client.

""What a boy God has gifted me"" - mother Padma Kumari on Gukesh winning World Championship 2024

NEW DELHI: 18-year-old D Gukesh rewrote history by becoming the youngest World Chess Champion , dethroning China’s Ding Liren in a nerve-wracking 14-game series in Singapore.His triumph stirred waves of admiration across the globe, not just for the sheer brilliance of his gameplay but also for the unique sacrifices that shaped his meteoric rise.Central to his extraordinary journey is his mother, Padma Kumari , who candidly shared the behind-the-scenes struggles and decisions made by the family.One of the most pivotal and unconventional choices was withdrawing Gukesh from formal schooling after the 4th or 5th grade.In an interview with ChessBase India, Padma revealed, ""There are many critical moments when we doubted ourselves. I don't know how to say it exactly. Whenever he didn’t play well, we used to wonder whether we had made the right decision for him. He was very young, and it was our responsibility to make decisions for him. You know, he didn’t go to school after fourth or fifth grade.”This decision, while unconventional in the contemporary Indian setting, enabled Gukesh to focus entirely on his passion for the game.""So, in India -- or anywhere -- it’s a big decision. For any child, not studying is risky. It was a risk-taking moment, deciding whether it was appropriate to stop his studies and put him fully into chess,"" she added.""Whenever he achieved something or his rating improved, we felt happy, like we were on the right path. But as parents, whenever he didn’t do well in a tournament, we doubted ourselves—not Gukesh, but our decision. This happened many times, especially during his younger days. But as he matured, we could see how disciplined and hardworking he was. That gave us confidence. We knew he would definitely come up.""Despite the scepticism and challenges, Padma emphasized her unwavering belief in her son’s talent and hard work, coupled with a deep trust in God.“Not sending him to school was such a tough call, and even now, many people say we took a risk. You know, choosing a different path—keeping him out of school and putting him fully into chess—came with so much uncertainty. Initially, we thought we’d wait till 8th grade and then decide. But even after 9th grade, we saw him showing improvement, so we kept going. By God’s grace, everything went well,” Padma recounted.""This (seeing Gukesh become the world chess champion) is the first time I feel we made the correct decision. He wouldn’t have been able to balance both school and chess. When you focus entirely on one thing—your passion—you can definitely shine.""In a grand ceremony organized by the Tamil Nadu State Government last Tuesday, Gukesh was honored for his outstanding achievements in chess. The event, held with much fanfare, was graced by the presence of Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin, who personally felicitated the young prodigy. As a gesture of recognition and encouragement, the Chief Minister presented Gukesh with a cheque for Rs 5 crore.","18-year-old D Gukesh is youngest World Chess Champion.

However, I did not have an active executive role, nor was I involved in the day-to-day operations of the businesses. Given my demanding schedule as a professional cricketer, TV presenter, and commentator, neither did I have the time nor expertise to participate in their operations.

Buzbee’s defense: Conspiracy and smear campaign

A troubling future for Buzbee's legal career

Texas lawyer Anthony Buzbee, a prominent figure in the Lone Star State’s legal landscape, is facing serious legal and public scrutiny following a series of shocking accusations. Known for his aggressive litigation style, Buzbee is no stranger to high-profile cases. Recently, however, his name has been thrust into the limelight for far more troubling reasons.Buzbee, who has represented a host of celebrity clients and high-profile cases, is now at the center of a lawsuit filed in Manhattan Supreme Court on Thursday, where he faces accusations of deliberately transmitting a sexually transmitted disease (STD) to a woman and causing physical harm.As per the report by the New York Post, the lawsuit, filed anonymously, alleges that in 2018, Buzbee “lured” the woman into a sexual encounter while concealing the fact that he was infected with a venereal disease. According to court documents, Buzbee “manipulated” the woman into silence, offering her free legal services in exchange for her compliance and to cover up his misconduct.The woman claims that Buzbee’s actions didn’t stop there. The lawsuit further alleges that after seeing her talk to another man at a bar in New York City, Buzbee became violently possessive, smashing a glass against her face and causing two broken teeth. The woman continued her relationship with Buzbee out of shame, as he was the only sexual partner she did not feel obligated to inform about her STD test results, reported the Post.In 2021, Buzbee allegedly represented the woman, referred to as Jane Doe, in her divorce case, using the legal proceedings to further manipulate her. The suit accuses him of doctoring medical records to make it appear as if her husband, not Buzbee, had infected her with the disease, and then attempting to blackmail her husband by sending a fraudulent demand letter.These allegations come on the heels of Buzbee's involvement in yet another high-profile lawsuit—one involving music mogul Jay-Z. In October, Buzbee filed a controversial lawsuit against Jay-Z and Sean “Diddy” Combs, accusing them of sexually assaulting a 13-year-old girl at a party in 2000. Jay-Z, through his lawyer, has denied the allegations, calling the suit “full of inconsistencies.”Buzbee, in turn, has accused Jay-Z’s Roc Nation of orchestrating a smear campaign against him. He claims the entertainment company has been soliciting former clients to file lawsuits against his law firm. Buzbee filed a suit in Texas, alleging that Roc Nation is engaging in illegal tactics to manipulate individuals into bringing frivolous cases against him.As these legal battles unfold, Buzbee's reputation as a powerful attorney is now mired in controversy. While he maintains that these lawsuits are part of a larger conspiracy to damage his career, the serious nature of the allegations against him is raising questions about his future in the legal world and the long-term impact on his career.","Texas lawyer Anthony Buzbee is accused of deliberately transmitting a sexually transmitted disease (STD) to a woman and causing physical harm.

Significance of Googleyness and why it matters now?



Also Read |

The term ""Googleyness"" has been loosely used at Google for so long, originally to help screen if potential employees would ""fit in"" with Google's culture and values, but the meaning had, over time, become imprecise. In his attempt to clear up any confusion, Google CEO Sundar Pichai , in a recent company-wide forum, explained what ""Googley"" really is. He said that the term became too wide and that some straightforward understanding was needed of it for both the employees as well as the process for hiring them. This effort is to explain clearly what it actually means to embody ""Googleyness"" within the Googleyness "" has been one of the ambiguous terms that have been used in Google for a long time; it was initially meant to determine whether or not those prospective employees would fit within the company's culture and values.Its meaning however became increasingly opaque over time. This effort aims at bringing clearness to the confusion brought about by the use of the term. Google CEO Sundar Pichai recently tried to clarify what ""Googleyness"" actually meant in a company-wide forum. According to him, the term has become too broad and therefore required a more straightforward interpretation both for the employees and hiring process.Pichai articulated some key defining characteristics of what it means to be ""Googley."" Once more, these are not specifically how to fit in at some corporate culture but about how staff must handle their work and interface with the others. So, in detailed details, here's how this defines the principles set in place.At Google, the mission is the first priority. People are motivated to focus on the larger goals and vision of the company. It is supposed that every employee should work for the same purpose and contribute to making a positive impact in the world. This is not about personal success but about aligning efforts with Google's mission of organizing the world's information and making it universally accessible and useful.Google has always been innovative and focused on creating products that are genuinely useful to people. Being ""Googley"" means making things that help improve lives. It's about creating products and services that provide value, solve problems, and have a positive impact on users. Whether it is through search, Android, or Google Maps, making something helpful is central to the company's ethos.It calls for boldness, but the company encourages people to be bold with their ideas. Boldness must have responsibility. To take the risk is a part of the job and being willing to try new things; emphasis, however, is on taking responsibility for results, be they good or bad. The ""Googley"" mentality thrives under this delicate balance of dare to tackle the big challenge and responsibility.When trying to do something new in the tech world, scarce resources abound-especially for individuals trying to do something rarely done before. ""To remain scrappy"" colloquially means resourceful, flexible, and tenacious in pursuit of solving a challenge. At Google, even when one didn't have all of the resources that he/she might want, they were encouraged to be resourceful in their approach to solving problems.Known to most as a fun, open, and relaxed work culture, Google has been long characterized by this approach. However, ""Googleyness"" is much more than just having a good time-it is about hustling and pushing forward to get things done and to have fun at the same time. The core idea here is how work cannot be dull or stressful but instead be enjoyable and rewarding yet with hard work and determination.Teamwork is given utmost importance at Google. To be ""Googley"" is to work in a collaborative manner, working across different departments, and to help one another to reach the ultimate goal as a team. It gives less importance to individual performance and focuses on the team instead. According to the company, the output will always be greater if everyone gets along rather than when people go it alone.Googleyness is a word that has evolved over time. Once used to define if the candidate will ""fit in"" the company's culture, this term today is defined as having qualities of intellectual humility, love for fun, and comfort with uncertainty by Laszlo Bock, former head of human resources for Google in his 2015 book *Work Rules*. These were the qualities Google required of people to thrive in its ecosystem, but the company realized that ""Googleyness"" was not nearly as clear-cut as the company had once thought it to be.In 2019, Google significantly changed its hiring practice in order not to confuse ""Googleyness"" with ""culture fit."" That was important because the term ""culture fit"" was always criticized for killing diversity. The company wanted the workplace to be more inclusive by emphasizing adaptability, openness, and the capacity to work with diverse perspectives. It was important to make sure that the candidates were not rejected just because they did not fit a certain, narrow mold.Pichai’s recent clarification of Googleyness signals a shift from simply being ""fun-loving"" or ""easy-going"" to something deeper—about having a purpose-driven approach to work, embracing boldness, and supporting one’s team. It’s clear that being Googley today is about more than just having a great time at work or fitting into a specific mold. It’s about pushing boundaries, being flexible in the face of challenges, and making a positive difference in the world.As the tech industry and the workplace change, Google is saying clearly that ""Googleyness"" is not about shallow characteristics or being a particular kind of person. It is about building a workplace where people work with a sense of purpose, contribute meaningfully, support one another, and remain agile in a constantly changing world.The clarification on Googleyness by Sundar Pichai indicates that the company is changing toward a more purposeful, inclusive, and team-oriented work culture. The new definition of Googleyness is not just a set of rules but a mindset that employees are supposed to have. It is the concept of having work driven by a collective mission, bold ideas, collaboration, and an energy that is both purposeful and fun. No more about fitting in but rather about contributing to something bigger than yourself while enjoying the journey along the way.","Google CEO Sundar Pichai recently tried to clarify what ""Googleyness"" actually meant in a company-wide forum.

They were supposed to be in the car, but...

BENGALURU: ""A container truck going over the road divider and crashing on a car coming in the opposite direction, it was one of the most horrible accidents ever witnessed on this busy highway. Six innocent lives were snuffed out within seconds for no fault of theirs. Pulling each victim from the mangled remains of the SUV was heart-wrenching. These images are sure to haunt us for some time,"" recounted a fire service staffer at the accident spot near Nelamangala, where city-based automotive software company CEO Chandram Yegapagol and five of his family members were killed.The cause of the tragedy: A callous and mindless car driver who decided to slow down his vehicle in the middle of the road!Reconstructing the sequence of events, a Nelamangala policeman said: ""The tragedy was sparked by a thoughtless decision made by a car driver. A blue car ahead of the container truck suddenly slowed down in the middle of the road, possibly to search for a restaurant or exit. This abrupt slowdown forced the container truck driver, who was trailing the car, to brake hard. In the chaos, he lost control, causing the truck to veer across the divider and collide fatally with Chandram's Volvo SUV, which was moving in the opposite direction. The SUV was crushed beyond recognition, with the family caught in the tragic incident they couldn't have foreseen or avoided.With traffic coming to a halt, locals and fellow motorists rushed to the spot hoping to rescue the victims trapped in the SUV. Nelamangala fire station officer KN Siddavanappa said: ""Taking the container truck, which was laden with aluminium, off the car was a herculean task. The truck was so heavy it wouldn't budge an inch despite hundreds of people trying to push it to the side. Subsequently, four heavy-duty cranes had to be summoned to the spot. It took nearly three hours to lift the container.""Following this, the locals along with police tried to pull out the victims, but in vain. ""Extricating their bodies from the metal wreckage was also a big challenge, they were all dead in their seats,"" said Manjunath, a local volunteer. Based on Chandram's brother's complaint, Nelamangala traffic police registered a case against container truck driver Arif and have also launched a search for the blue car, which triggered the tragedy.Srinivasulu, an accounts manager in Chandram's company for the last five years, said: ""This is an unfortunate thing to have happened to all of us. Chandram was a very good employer. He had started the new company and we were all set to move into a new building in the next two months, the puja was also done.He told us he was taking off as he had to go to his village. His father, who was not keeping well, was discharged from hospital recently and he was eager to meet him. But fate had other designs. His death is a great loss for all of us."" Chandram had given employment to around 150 people and was planning to expand in Pune.Two family members narrowly escaped being part of the tragedy, their stories underscoring the twist of fate that spared them. Shashikanth, nephew of Chandram, recounted how close he came to being in the ill-fated SUV. ""Yesterday, Chandram uncle asked me to come home with him. We were supposed to travel together to the village today. But I couldn't get leave from work. And now, this has happened,"" he said, wiping away tears.Chandram had bought the SUV during Deepavali and this was a long trip planned. Another relative, Veena said: ""Chandram had invited me to travel with them. When I last spoke to him on the phone, he said they had crossed the city. I had planned to join them later by bus in the evening, but the accident happened and the loss of my family is unbearable.""","Chandram Yegapagol and five of his family members were killed.

Even Bill Gates will go bankrupt: Elon Musk



A deepfake video of Elon Musk endorsing a fake $20 million crypto giveaway is going viral, causing widespread confusion and concern. Sharing the video on X (formerly Twitter), DogeDesigner posted: “BREAKING: A deepfake of Elon Musk promoting a $20 million crypto giveaway is going viral.” The post further warned: “Elon Musk and his companies are NOT running any crypto giveaways. Don’t fall for scams! Stay safe.”In the video, Elon Musk can be seen saying “Here’s a surprise for everyone. I’ll be doing a $20 million crypto giveaway at Elon4u.com for one week starting on December 13.” He further adds “ If I am serious? Yes, go to Elon4u.com. It’s just a few quick steps that shouldn’t take longer than three minutes”.The Tesla CEO wrote on X that Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates might go bankrupt if Tesla becomes “the world’s most valuable company by far,” reigniting the feud over Gates’ short position against the electric vehicle giant. At present, Tesla’s market capitalization sits at $1.251 trillion, trailing far behind Apple Inc. – the world’s largest company, which leads at $3.729 trillion. For Tesla to claim the top spot, it would need to grow by nearly 200%.In the post on X, Musk wrote “If Tesla does become the world’s most valuable company by far, that short position will bankrupt even Bill Gates”. Short position here refers to a stock market strategy where an investor borrows shares of a stock they do not own, sells them on the open market, and aims to buy them back later at a lower price.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

* IT, Auto stocks shine

* Q3 results season starts

* Positive global cues

* China stocks rise

* Rupee gains

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.
