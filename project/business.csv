‘Unable to accept erosion of its dominance’: Russia slams Trump’s tariffs; hails Brics-Global South unity,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/unable-to-accept-erosion-of-its-dominance-russia-slams-trumps-tariffs-hails-brics-global-south-unity/articleshow/123109234.cms,"BRICS ‘KILL DOLLAR’ Move ‘SHOCKS’ Trump; Russia Ally China Leads Currency Revolt | Watch





Russia has accused the United States of pushing a ""neocolonial agenda"" after President Donald Trump announced substantial hike in tariffs on the global south. In a sharp rebuke, Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the move reflected Washington’s inability to cope with a shifting global order.""Sanctions and restrictions have unfortunately become a defining feature of the current historical period,"" Zakharova said in response to a media query on the US decision to tighten tariffs against countries in the Global South.""Unable to accept the erosion of its dominance in an emerging multipolar international order, Washington continues to pursue a neocolonial agenda, employing politically motivated economic pressure against those who choose an independent course on the international stage.""Zakharova asserted that no sanctions or tariff wars would stop the evolution of the international system. ""Nonetheless, we firmly believe that no tariff wars or sanctions can halt the natural course of history. We are supported by a vast number of partners, like-minded states, and allies, particularly among the countries of the Global South and, above all, within Brics, who share this perspective,"" she said.Zakharova accused the United States of violating the very principles of free trade it once championed, pointing to what she called ""politically driven protectionism and the arbitrary imposition of tariff barriers.""She named Brazil—Russia’s strategic partner in Latin America—as one of the main victims of such policies, and said these actions amount to interference in other countries' internal affairs and pose a broader threat to global economic stability.""We stand ready to deepen cooperation with them to resist unlawful unilateral sanctions and to help shape a genuinely multipolar, just, and equitable international order,” Zakharova said.Her remarks came in response to Trump’s statement on Truth Social, where he accused India of profiting from reselling Russian oil and declared that the US would “substantially raise the tariff paid by India.”India has pushed back strongly, calling the criticism ""unjustified and unreasonable."" The Ministry of External Affairs in New Delhi said that India’s imports are driven by national interest and energy security, and pointed to ongoing US and EU trade with Russia in energy and other sectors.","Russia has accused the United States of pushing a ""neocolonial agenda"" after President Donald Trump announced substantial hike in tariffs on the global south.

"'One of the worst orders': In a 1st, SC bars HC judge from hearing criminal cases",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/one-of-the-worst-orders-in-a-1st-sc-bars-hc-judge-from-hearing-criminal-cases/articleshow/123127665.cms,"SC: Passing of such absurd & erroneous orders unpardonable

NEW DELHI: Enraged by what it termed ""one of the worst and most erroneous orders we have come across"", Supreme Court has pulled up Allahabad HC's Justice Prashant Kumar for allowing criminal proceedings in a civil dispute case. Questioning Kumar's competence in deciding criminal cases, SC, in an unprecedented order, directed he shouldn't be given any criminal case for adjudication till he retires, and must be made to sit with a seasoned judge of the HC in a division bench.""The judge has not only cut a sorry figure for himself but has made a mockery of justice. We are at our wits' end to understand what's wrong with judiciary at the level of HC,"" Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan said.SC said at times ""we are left wondering whether such orders are passed on some extraneous considerations or it is sheer ignorance of law. Whatever it be, passing of such absurd and erroneous orders is unpardonable"". It said the erroneous order was not an exception as Justice Kumar had passed similarly unpardonable ones over a period of time, which left them with no option but to take the extreme step.The case pertains to sale of goods and payment between two businessmen.The seller had delivered goods worth Rs 52.34 lakh out of which he was paid Rs 47.75 lakh. As the balance amount was not paid, he lodged a criminal case, leading to the other businessman to move HC for quashing the case.While allowing criminal proceedings in the case, a single bench of Justice Kumar justified his decision, saying that the complainant would not be in a position to pursue the civil litigation as it will take years and he will have to put more money to pursue the litigation. ""To be more precise, it would seem like good money chasing bad money. If this court allows the matter to be referred to civil court on account of civil dispute between the parties, it would amount to travesty of justice and O.P. no.2 (complainant) would suffer irreparable loss and he might even not be in a position to emerge from the financial constraints to pursue the matter,"" he had said.Expressing shock over the stand taken by the judge the SC bench said, ""Is it the understanding of the high court that ultimately if the accused is convicted, the trial court would award him the balance amount? The observations recorded... are shocking. It is an extremely sad day for one and all to read the observations... It was expected of the high court to know the well-settled position of law that in cases of civil dispute a complainant cannot be permitted to resort to criminal proceedings as the same would amount to abuse of process of law.""It was expected of the HC to understand the nature of the allegations levelled in the complaint. In substance the HC has said in so many words that the criminal proceedings instituted by the complainant in a case of pure civil dispute is justified because it may take considerable time for the complainant to recover the balance amount by preferring a civil suit,"" it said.The bench quashed the order and directed that the case be reconsidered by the HC but by another judge.""The chief justice of the high court shall immediately withdraw the present criminal determination from the judge concerned. The chief justice shall make the judge concerned sit in a division bench with a seasoned senior judge of the HC. We further direct that the judge concerned shall not be assigned any criminal determination, till he demits office. If at all he is to be made to sit as a single judge, he shall not be assigned any criminal determination,"" the apex court said.","Supreme Court pulls up Allahabad HC's Justice Prashant Kumar for allowing criminal proceedings in a civil dispute case.

Finland-based thinktank exposes US double standard,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/finland-based-thinktank-exposes-us-double-standard/articleshow/123151870.cms,"NEW DELHI: European Union countries account for 23% of Russia's revenues from fossil fuel exports against India's 13% since the beginning of the Ukraine conflict, while G7+ tankers are currently transporting more than half of those barrels, data published by CREA (Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air) shows.Indian govt sources here said this further spotlighted Western hypocrisy in targeting India for securing its energy interests, while ignoring similar action by other countries. European Union has been procuring not just energy but also fertilizers, chemicals, iron, steel and transport equipment from Russia.""These figures only vindicate India's emphasis on ensuring for its citizens regular and affordable energy supplies,"" said a source on condition of anonymity.Seen in the backdrop of the US on Wednesday doubling tariff on India to 50% for ""fuelling the Russian war machine"" by buying its oil and last month's EU sanction on Indian refining entity Nayara Energy, the Finland-based independent think-tank's latest report exposes what New Delhi describes as West's ""double standard"" in singling out India.The report says Moscow has raked in EUR 923 billion (92,300 crore) so far from fossil fuel exports such as oil, natural gas, coal, refined fuels and intermediaries.Of this, EUR 212 billion (21,200 crore) came from EU countries compared with EUR 121 billion (12,100 crore) from India. China remained the top bu-yer of Russian energy with a tab of over EUR 200 billion (20,000 crore).The report points out the growing role of G7 tankers in transporting Russian oil since the EU's June sanctions. This underlines the disconnect between western policy and practice pointed out by New Delhi. ""Since Jan, the G7+ share in Russian oil transport has increased from 36% to 56%,"" it says. More than half of Russian seaborne oil exports were transported in G7+ tankers in June, reflecting a six percentage point increase over May.Use of western tanker fleet means those shipments were compliant with the price cap and other terms of the sanctions. India argues it has helped prevent a flare-up in oil prices by buying Russian oil, accounting for about 9% of daily global supply. That is also the key consideration that led the US and the EU to opt for a price cap - rather than choking off the flow with sanctions - for curbing funding for Moscow's war efforts without spooking the oil markets.Overall, however, the report does say that ""Russian fossil fuel revenues in second quarter of 2025 dropped by 18% year-on-year - lowest in a quarter since the invasion of Ukraine. This occurred despite an 8% increase in volumes exported in Q2 compared to Q1 of 2025.""Read | Trump tariffs: Exporters on edge, fear losing orders","European Union countries account for 23% of Russia's revenues from fossil fuel exports.

SC judges take exception to order against HC judge,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-judges-take-exception-to-order-against-hc-judge/articleshow/123151364.cms,"NEW DELHI: Top judges of Supreme Court have taken strong exception to the order passed on Tuesday by a bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan castigating an Allahabad high court judge for lack of knowledge in criminal law and de-rostering him from hearing criminal cases for life, and are mulling steps to remedy an unpleasant situation created in breach of repeated SC rulings.A concerned Chief Justice of India B R Gavai consulted his senior colleagues and is now discussing ways and means to remedy the order that has created difficulties for the chief justice (CJ) of one of the oldest high courts of India, at Allahabad.SC has repeatedly ruled that the CJ of an HC is the master of the roster and he alone can allocate, roster and assign cases to single, division and three-judge benches in HC and that his discretion is not amenable to judicial orders.Justices Pardiwala and Mahadevan ordered the Allahabad HC CJ to ""immediately withdraw the present criminal determination from the concerned judge"" and ""make the judge sit in a division bench with a seasoned senior judge"". They also said, ""We further direct that the concerned judge shall not be assigned any criminal determination, till he demits office"".Irrespective of the folly of the HC judge, SC, which gives primacy to principles of natural justice, passed the caustic and damaging order against the judge without giving him an opportunity to explain why he passed the impugned directive.Justices Pardiwala and Mahadevan called the HC judge's order one of the worst they had come across in their tenures as SC judges, and said, ""The judge concerned has not only cut a sorry figure for himself but has made a mockery of justice. We are at our wits' end to understand what is wrong with the Indian judiciary at the level of HC.""TOI spoke to a number of former CJIs, who too expressed concern over the manner in which the bench led by Justice Pardiwala proceeded to castigate the HC judge, stressing that errors in HC orders are not uncommon and are regularly appealed in SC.A judge's mistake in appreciating legal points or facts in a particular case cannot empower SC, while deciding appeals against an HC judgment, to castigate the judge who authored that judgment and take punitive measures like de-rostering him, which, the ex-CJIs said, was the sole prerogative of the HC CJ.Incidentally, the bench of Justices Pardiwala and Mahadevan had fixed timelines for the President and governors to grant or refuse assent to bills passed by state assemblies, while granting ""deemed approval"" to bills pending with the TN governor. The President has since sent a reference to SC seeking its opinion on whether the apex court has the power to fix timelines for her and governors when the Constitution does not provide for the same, and whether SC can use powers under Article 142 to grant deemed approval to bills.In the case of Braj Kishore Thakur vs. Union of India (1997), SC had ruled: ""Higher courts must remind themselves constantly that higher tiers are provided in the judicial hierarchy to set right errors which could possibly have crept in findings or orders of courts at the lower tiers. Such powers are certainly not for belching diatribe at judicial personages in lower cadre. It is best to remember the words of a jurist that 'a judge who has not committed any error is yet to be born'. ..""In Rajasthan vs Prakash Chand (1997), another three-judge bench said ""that the administrative control of HC vests in the chief justice alone. On the judicial side, however, he is only the first amongst equals. The CJ is the master of the roster. He alone has the prerogative to constitute benches of the court and allocate cases to the benches so constituted. The puisne judges can only do that work as is allotted to them by the chief justice or under his directions. No judge or judges can give directions to the Registry for listing any case before him or them which runs counter to the directions given by the chief justice."" This ruling was made applicable to SC by a three-judge bench's judgment in 2018.","Justices Pardiwala and Mahadevan called the HC judge's order one of the worst they had come across in their tenures as SC judges.

A dedicated helpline has also been set up to address grievances raised by boards.Going by the information shared by the ministry at the time of portal’s launch on June 6, it is estimated that there are over 9 lakh waqf properties in India. It was shared then that the central waqf portal will follow a three-tier verification system comprising the ‘maker-checker-approver’. After a mutawalli enters property details as the ‘maker’, it will be followed by validation by waqf board officials and approval by the designated govt authority after verification of records to enable its entry into the ‘Umeed’ portal.The 663 ‘makers’, who have initiated the process of uploading details, include 193 are from Odisha, 102 from Uttarakhand and 69 from Andhra Pradesh. No makers have initiated the process in Chhattisgarh, Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Mizoram, Sikkim, Goa, Ladakh and Lakshadweep.Of those who have submitted details — 27 are from Himachal Pradesh. 11 from Odisha, five from Manipur, four from Andhra Pradesh, three each from Rajasthan and Punjab, two from Uttarakhand and one each from UP, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Telangana and Delhi.“About 140 grievances/suggestions have been received from across the country as on July 28 and their resolutions have also been uploaded on the portal to help other boards to understand and handle the portal’s functioning effectively,” Rijiju said.The ministry has also advised establishment of Project Management Units (PMUs) at the Central, state/UT, Waqf board, and district levels to ensure that the details of all properties are uploaded on the Portal.","Only 69 ‘makers of waqf’ have submitted details of property on the website.

Doubtful conduct of an accused not enough for conviction: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/doubtful-conduct-of-an-accused-not-enough-for-conviction-sc/articleshow/123150746.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court has ruled that the doubtful conduct of an accused cannot be the sole criterion to convict him if there is no other evidence to prove his involvement in a crime and acquitted a murder convict who was sentenced to life imprisonment.Setting aside the trial court and high court's order of conviction, a bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan said: ""In this context, we deem it necessary to sound a note of caution. While the conduct of an accused may be a relevant fact under Section 8 of Indian Evidence Act, it cannot, by itself, serve as the sole basis for conviction, especially in a grave charge such as murder. Like any other piece of evidence, the conduct of the accused is merely one of the circumstances the court may consider, in conjunction with other direct or circumstantial evidence on record. To put it succinctly, although relevant, the accused's conduct alone cannot justify a conviction in the absence of cogent and credible supporting evidence"".The trial court and Chhattisgarh high court had relied on the conduct of the accused, who had allegedly approached the police and lodged an FIR admitting that he committed the offence, to pronounce him guilty.But the apex court said an FIR of a confessional nature lodged by an accused person is inadmissible as evidence against him, except to the extent that it shows he made a statement soon after the offence, thereby identifying him as the maker of the report, which is admissible as evidence of his conduct under the Act.""Additionally, any information furnished by him that leads to the discovery of a fact is admissible under Section 27 of the Act. However, a non-confessional FIR is admissible against the accused as an admission under Section 21 of the Act and is relevant,"" the bench said.The prosecution told the bench that the accused himself had gone to the police station and lodged the FIR and he also led the investigating officer and the panchnama witnesses to a place where he had kept the clothes worn by him during the incident. These were enough to convict him, it submitted.The bench, however, rejected the plea and said, ""The legal position, therefore, is this - a statement contained in the FIR furnished by one of the accused in the case cannot, in any manner, be used against another accused. Even against the accused who made it, the statement cannot be used if it is inculpatory in nature nor can it be used for the purpose of corroboration or contradiction unless its maker offers himself as a witness in the trial. The very limited use of it is, as an admission under Section 21 of the Act, against its maker alone, and only if the admission does not amount to a confession"".","The trial court and Chhattisgarh high court had relied on the conduct of the accused, who had allegedly approached the police and lodged an FIR admitting that he committed the offence.

KOLKATA: Calcutta high court's Jalpaiguri circuit bench has commuted the death sentence of 22-year-old Aftab Alam to life imprisonment without parole for 20 years, ruling that justice must not be ""bloodthirsty"" and punishment should focus on reform, not revenge.Aftab had been convicted of murdering his maternal uncle Mehtab during a robbery attempt at the victim's Dhupguri home in north Bengal on July 28, 2023. The trial court sentenced him to death, calling his act a ""betrayal"" against the man who had sheltered him after his father's death.But Justices Sabyasachi Bhattacharyya and Uday Kumar said in a 47-page ruling issued Aug 1 the trial court relied ""more on emotion than facts"" and failed to prove that Aftab's conduct met the ""rarest of rare"" threshold required for capital punishment. ""The recent alteration in the names of jails from 'prisons' to 'correctional homes' is for a reason,"" the bench wrote. ""It reflects the transition from the basic bloodthirsty instinct of society to take revenge to a more civilised policy. .. One should hate the offence and not the offender.""HC said Aftab had not lived with his uncle for years, having moved to New Delhi before returning to Dhupguri. ""The 'position of trust' approach cannot be applied,"" the judges wrote, adding that the trial judge's assumptions about betrayal lacked evidence.""At the time of the offence, the appellant was long gone from the shelter of his uncle and was no longer under his tutelage.""Mehtab was stabbed to death in his sleep while wife Moumita survived the attack. Aftab was joined by five alleged co-accused, all minors. The court said the killing appeared to be ""a spontaneous reaction"" rather than a premeditated act of vengeance, citing the use of Aftab's Aadhaar card to check into a hotel nearby before the robbery.Rejecting the trial court's claim that Aftab was a ""veteran criminal"", the bench said his actions showed ""unprofessionalism"" typical of immature offenders. ""Lack of remorse in gestures & postures of the accused at trial cannot be an indicator that he cannot be reformed,"" the court said.","Calcutta high court's Jalpaiguri circuit bench commuted the death sentence of 22-year-old Aftab Alam to life imprisonment without parole for 20 years.

"Tackling untouchables: IISc patents tech to deal with MLPs, textile waste",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tackling-untouchables-iisc-patents-tech-to-deal-with-mlps-textile-waste/articleshow/123150650.cms,"BENGALURU: In the global battle against waste, two streams stand out for their notorious resistance to recycling: multi-layered plastics (MLPs) and synthetic textiles. Dubbed “untouchables” in the recycling world, these materials are complex, chemically diverse, and largely destined for landfills or incineration.But a new technology developed at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) may offer a viable and scalable path forward. The breakthrough comes in the form of “SaLSO”, short for Solvent-Assisted Layer Selective Opening, a patented process created by Prof Suryasarathi Bose and his team at IISc’s department of materials engineering.Used extensively in packaging (like potato chips) for their barrier properties and durability, MLPs are nearly impossible to recycle due to their mixed composition. At the same time, synthetic textile waste from polyester-based and nylon-based clothing continues to swell landfills and leach microplastics into ecosystems.“Together, MLPs and synthetic textiles represent a mounting global challenge. MLPs alone form a market worth over $168 billion, while the textile industry generates more than 92 million tonnes of waste each year, a significant chunk of it synthetic. Recycling efforts have struggled to keep pace, hamstrung by technical and chemical limitations,” the researchers pointed out.The new patent builds on earlier work by the team — which has been reported — where SaLSO was tried on Polyurethane and Epoxy, and found to be efficient in transforming those difficult to recycle materials.In the current process that has been granted a patent, SaLSO separates the individual components of complex plastic and textile waste streams, allowing each material to be recovered and reused in high-value applications. “It’s a solution that’s not just technically impressive but also environmentally sound. It is a game-changer. We’ve developed a process that works on materials considered unrecyclable — category-7 plastics, mixed polyester textiles —and turns them into usable, upcycled products,” Bose told TOI.His co-researchers, Indranil Dey, Ashish and Siddharth, echoed the sentiment, adding that SaLSO could play a catalytic role in scaling up circular economy solutions across sectors that currently have limited recycling pathways.What makes SaLSO remarkable is its simplicity and sustainability. The process uses only seawater and bio-acids — naturally occurring and even edible chemicals — to separate polymers like polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) from complex waste matrices.The result? A recovery yield of more than 99%, achieved without toxic solvents, high temperatures, or energy-intensive steps.In lab trials, the team processed a variety of real-world waste, including snack packets with aluminum linings and flour bags, using a reactor that currently handles about 500 grams of MLP per batch. While small-scale now, the system is designed for easy scale-up to industrial capacities.The extracted polymers are not just recycled, they are upcycled. “...The feedstock produced can enhance the performance of lower-quality plastics, creating stronger, more durable materials without adding virgin polymers or fillers. And the applications go far beyond theory,” Bose added.With industrial trials in the pipeline and conversations ongoing with potential partners, IISc hopes to bring SaLSO to market soon. If widely adopted, the technology could radically expand the boundaries of what’s considered recyclable, bringing circular economy principles to industries that have long lacked them.","Multi-layered plastics (MLPs) and synthetic textiles are notoriously difficult to recycle.

Rajouri-based organisation Al-Huda Educational Trust — an alleged front for JeI’s illegal transactions — was named the fourth accused.JeI was first declared a banned organisation by Indian govt in Feb 28, 2019, for its activities against the security, integrity and sovereignty of the Union of India. On Feb 27, 2024, the prohibition for the “unlawful association” was extended for five more years under UAPA Section 3(1).According to the prosecution, Amir Mohammad Shamsi, who had earlier served as JeI’s Amir-e-Jila in Rajouri, conspired with Abdul Hamid Ganai, then Amir-e-Jamaat of the outfit, to collect funds through Al-Huda Educational Trust despite JeI having been declared a proscribed association in Feb 2019.“Witness statements and financial documents revealed that Shamsi received Rs 1.8 lakh from Mushtaq Ahmad Mir, a Pakistan-based terrorist affiliated with Hizbul Mujahideen, and disbursed Rs 1 lakh to Ganai for furtherance of separatist activities,” the prosecution informed the court.Special NIA judge Sandeep Gandotra noted that while disclosure statements recorded before executive magistrates were inadmissible, independent evidence — including statements of trustees and local donors under CrPC Section 164 — substantiated the prosecution’s case. The court held that cumulative evidence, including trust deeds, money transfers, and corroborative witness testimonies, justified the framing of charges under IPC Section 120B (criminal conspiracy) and UAPA Sections 10, 13, 20, 22C, 38, and 39.Meanwhile, proceedings under CrPC Section 512 have been initiated against fugitive accused Mir, who is believed to be operating from Pakistan.","The accused are Amir Mohammad Shamsi, Abdul Hamid Ganai and Mushtaq Ahmad Mir.

TCS Salary Hike: TCS to roll out hikes for majority of staff from Sept 1,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/tcs-to-roll-out-hikes-for-majority-of-staff-from-sept-1/articleshow/123149301.cms,"



Bengaluru: TCS, which is planning to cut 2% of its workforce—over 12,000 mid and senior employees—this year, surprised its staff by announcing salary hikes for eligible associates up to grade C3A and equivalent (freshers to mid-level), covering nearly 80% of its workforce. This comes at a time when many of its peers have either deferred salary hikes or placed them on hold.The salary hike will be effective from Sept 1, according to an internal communication sent out by CHRO Milind Lakkad and CHRO-designate K Sudeep on Wednesday. When TOI reached out to TCS, the company said, ""We can confirm that we will be issuing wage hikes to around 80% of our employees effective Sept 1, 2025.""During the April earnings presser, TCS indicated that it might have to defer its annual increments, a rare deviation from its April cycle, coinciding with clients' downbeat sentiment emerging from a slowdown and tariff-related uncertainty. Even in the June quarter earnings, Lakkad said the company has not made any decision yet regarding wage hikes. TCS's June quarter results reflected lacklustre performance attributed to weak macroeconomic conditions, cautious client sentiment, delayed decision-making, and the winding down of the BSNL deal. Its revenue for the June quarter fell 3.1% year-on-year in constant currency and 3.3% sequentially, as geopolitical uncertainties dampened demand.Last year, TCS implemented salary hikes ranging from 4.5% to 7% for its associates, with high performers receiving double-digit increases. However, the company has not disclosed the average hike in its communication. News of this year's salary increase comes amid a challenging period marked by cautious client spending and delayed decisions in key markets like the US and Europe. Nevertheless, the company remains optimistic about a turnaround, anticipating stronger demand in the second half of the year.Indian IT CEOs have adopted a cautious tone in their commentary on wage hikes. When TOI asked Infosys CEO Salil Parekh about the timelines for wage hikes, he said, ""We concluded our compensation increases for Q4 and Q1 of the last fiscal year….Now that this cycle is complete, we are beginning to evaluate the timing for the next round—as we do after every cycle. During Covid, the standard cycle was disrupted, leading to two increases over 18 months. There are no changes planned. We will stick with our existing process and announce the next cycle at the right time.""","TCS announced salary hikes for eligible associates up to grade C3A and equivalent (freshers to mid-level) This comes at a time when many of its peers have either deferred salary hikes or placed them on hold.

David Lochridge, a former employee of Oceangate, has reiterated longstanding safety concerns following the release of a US Coast Guard report that identifies significant failures by the company as the primary cause of the 2023 Titan submersible disaster.""I always hoped that what happened wouldn't happen. But I just knew if they kept carrying on the way they were going and with that deficient equipment, then there would be an incident,"" Lochridge was quoted as saying by the BBC.""There is so much that could have been done differently. From the initial design, to the build, to the operations - people were sold a lie,"" he said.OceanGate was developing a new submersible designed to take paying passengers to the site of the Titanic wreck. However, in June 2023, the vessel tragically imploded during a dive, killing all five people on board, including OceanGate CEO Stockton Rush.The whistleblower was dismissed by OceanGate in 2018 after raising concerns about safety issues related to the submersible. He had joined the company seven years prior as its director of Marine Operations.""As the director of marine operations, I'm the one responsible for everybody,"" he said, reported the BBC.""I was responsible for the safety of all Oceangate personnel and all of the passengers that were going to be coming in the sub.""As chief pilot, his duties involved planning dives and personally operating the submersible, taking passengers 3,800 meters below the surface to view the Titanic. Ensuring safety was a central part of his role.The submersible that would later be named Titan was initially developed in collaboration with the University of Washington’s Applied Physics Laboratory (APL), with plans to construct its passenger hull with carbon fibre, a material that is not used for deep-diving subs, which typically rely on titanium or steel.Despite initially trusting the expertise of the APL team, Lochridge’s confidence began to wane by mid-2016 as OceanGate ended its partnership with APL and moved the design and construction of Titan in-house.""At that point, I started asking questions… and I felt I had a duty of care to keep asking them,"" said Lochridge. ""When the carbon hull came in, it was an absolute mess,” he added, noting visible flaws in the material.Lochridge was called to a meeting with Rush and other Oceangate employees after he submitted a report listing out the issues he was seeing.""I have no desire to die. I've got a nice granddaughter. I'm going to be around. I understand this kind of risk, and I'm going into it with eyes open, and I think this is one of the safest things I will ever do,” Rush said in the meeting in response to Lochridge raising safety concerns, reports the BBC.Lochridge contacted the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), which deemed his case urgent due to public safety risks and placed him under its whistleblower protection program. OSHA forwarded concerns to the US Coast Guard in February 2018.By July 2018, OceanGate sued Lochridge and his wife, alleging breach of contract and other claims. He responded with a countersuit for unfair dismissal. But by December 2018, they decided to drop the case.OceanGate pressed ahead with its plans to reach the Titanic at full speed.","David Lochridge, a former employee of Oceangate, has reiterated longstanding safety concerns.

Japan-US trade agreement: Tokyo to import ‘very beautiful’ Ford F-150s; duties on Japanese car exports still unclear,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/japan-us-trade-agreement-tokyo-to-import-very-beautiful-ford-f-150s-duties-on-japanese-car-exports-still-unclear/articleshow/123142186.cms,"

Stay informed with the latest business news, updates on bank holidays and public holidays.



Japan is set to begin importing Ford’s hefty F-150 pickup trucks, US President Donald Trump said on Tuesday, even as questions linger over the full scope of the countries’ trade agreement.The move comes as part of a deal announced in July, under which Japanese imports will be hit with a 15% ""reciprocal"" tariff, lower than the 25% previously threatened. The new rate is due to take effect from Thursday, in line with changes affecting several other countries.In exchange, Tokyo has agreed to lift ""restrictions"" on American cars entering Japan, including a key concession to recognise US vehicle safety standards.“They're taking our cars,” Trump told CNBC in a phone interview.“They're taking the very beautiful Ford F-150, which does very well. And I'm sure we'll do very well there, and other things that do very well here will also do well there.”While Japanese carmakers export millions of vehicles to the US each year, American cars are a rare sight on Japanese roads. Ford pulled out of the Japanese market nearly ten years ago, citing weak sales, as reported by AFP.The F-150, which is 2.4 metres (96 inches) wide with mirrors, is considered too large for Japan’s narrow roads, and American models often come with steering wheels on the left-hand side, opposite to Japanese driving norms.Despite the headline agreement, several aspects of the trade deal remain unclear. A major sticking point is when the US will reduce its own tariffs on Japanese cars. Currently, these stand at 27.5%, made up of a long-standing 2.5% levy plus an additional 25% introduced under Trump. That figure is meant to drop to 15%, though a timeline has yet to be confirmed.There is also uncertainity on whether other levies on Japan will be capped at 15%, or if this would come on top of existing ones. A recent US executive order suggested that the upper limit would apply solely to the European Union, not Japan.On Tuesday, Japan's tariffs envoy Ryosei Akazawa departed for Washington on what marks his ninth trip in ongoing trade talks.“One purpose of my visit is to prompt the issuance of the president's executive order regarding tariffs on autos and auto parts as early as possible,” Akazawa said before leaving.“I have confirmed with the United States that there are no discrepancies (regarding the reciprocal tariff rates), but keeping in mind the new duties will be implemented on Thursday, I would like to provide a reminder for a thorough response beforehand,” local media quoted him as saying.Adding to the confusion, Trump claimed that Japan would be investing $550 billion into the US economy, with America retaining 90% of the profits.“That's like a signing bonus that a baseball player would get,” he told CNBC. “That's our money. It's our money to invest as we like.”However, Japanese officials have indicated the sum will mainly comprise loans and loan guarantees, rather than direct investment.","Japan set to begin importing Ford’s hefty F-150 pickup trucks, US President Donald Trump said on Tuesday. The move comes as part of a deal announced in July, under which Japanese imports will be hit with a 15% ""reciprocal"" tariff. Tokyo has agreed to lift ""restrictions"" on American cars entering Japan, including a key concession to recognise US vehicle safety standards.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123142883,imgsize-2083228,width-400,resizemode-4/123142883.jpg"

India’s exporters are reeling from a major blow after the US imposed a steep 50% tariff on most Indian goods, a move the Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO) has called “extremely shocking. ”The fresh 25% hike, signed into order by US President Donald Trump on Wednesday, is in response to New Delhi’s continued purchase of Russian oil. It adds to an existing 25% duty, bringing the total tariff to 50% on nearly all Indian exports to the US.Sectors like textiles, marine products, and leather are expected to be hit the hardest.""This move is a severe setback for Indian exports, with nearly 55% of our shipments to the US market directly affected. The 50 per cent reciprocal tariff effectively imposes a cost burden, placing our exporters at a 30–35 per cent competitive disadvantage compared to peers from countries with lesser reciprocal tariff,"" FIEO director general Ajay Sahai told PTI.He further added that several export orders have already been put on hold as international buyers reassess sourcing plans as costs continue to soar.""For a large number of MSME-led sectors, absorbing this sudden cost escalation is simply not viable.Margins are already thin, and this additional blow could force exporters to lose long-standing clients,"" Sahai said.With the new tariff structure, Indian goods now face the highest import duty level into the US, on par with Brazil.Competitor countries face significantly lower duties:Myanmar - 40%Thailand - 36%Cambodia - 36%Bangladesh - 35 %Indonesia - 32%China and Sri Lanka - both 30%Malaysia - 25 per centPhilippines - 20%Vietnam - 20%""With this high tariff, the domestic exporters will have to look for alternative markets,"" Sahai added.In the financial year 2024–25, India-US bilateral trade stood at $131.8 billion, including $86.5 billion in exports and $45.3 billion in imports.","The fresh 25% hike, signed into order by US President Donald Trump on Wednesday, is in response to New Delhi’s continued purchase of Russian oil.

As India braces for a fresh round of tariffs imposed by the United States, Mahindra Group chairman Anand Mahindra urged the country to turn the crisis into a powerful opportunity by implementing bold economic reforms.On Wednesday, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order to impose an additional 25% tariff on Indian imports, citing India's continued oil trade with Russia.The White House said these imports posed an “unusual and extraordinary threat” to the US, justifying the move on grounds of national security and foreign policy.Once implemented, the total tariff burden on Indian goods entering the US will reach 50%, effective 21 days later.The Ministry of external affairs (MEA) called the move “unfair, unjustified and unreasonable.” In a statement, it said, “The United States has in recent days targeted India's oil imports from Russia. We have already made clear our position on these issues, including the fact that our imports are based on market factors and done with the overall objective of ensuring the energy security of 1.4 billion people of India.Amid this growing trade tension, Anand Mahindra posted a detailed message on social media platform X, pointing to what he called the ""law of unintended consequences"" and urged India to shape its own positive outcomes, as other nations like those in the EU and Canada have done during periods of global friction.""The ‘law of unintended consequences’ seems to be operating stealthily in the prevailing tariff war unleashed by the US,"" he wrote. Drawing parallels with India's transformative 1991 economic reforms, he suggested that this moment could become equally significant if the right steps are taken.He proposed two major actions: radically improving ease of doing business and unlocking the potential of tourism as a foreign exchange booster.Here are the two strong steps that India should take today:Improving the ease of doing businessMahindra stressed that India needs to move beyond small, gradual reforms and build a truly efficient single-window clearance system for all investment proposals. He pointed out that while many regulatory powers lie with individual states, a group of cooperative states could come together to launch a unified national platform.“If we demonstrate speed, simplicity, and predictability, we can make India an irresistible destination for global capital in a world seeking trusted partners,” his post said.Unleashing the power of tourism as a foreign exchange engineMahindra described tourism as one of India’s most underused sources of foreign exchange and job creation. He called for a major push to speed up visa processing, improve tourist services, and develop dedicated tourism corridors around popular destinations, with guaranteed safety, cleanliness, and hygiene.“These corridors can serve as models of excellence, encouraging other regions to emulate and raise national standards.”""And a broader action agenda to build on these pillars:Liquidity & Support for MSMEs; Infrastructure Investment acceleration; A Manufacturing Push, via enhancement and expansion of the scope of PLI schemes; Rationalise import duties so that duty on manufacturing inputs are lowered and assist in improving our competitiveness,"" he stated.Ending his post with a call for self-reliance, Mahindra wrote, ""Let the unintended consequences we create be the most intentional and transformative ones of all. We cannot fault others for putting their nations first. But we should be moved to make our own nation greater than ever.""As tensions simmer between Washington and New Delhi, the coming weeks may prove critical in determining whether India can transform this pressure into progress.","US President Donald Trump signed an executive order to impose an additional 25% tariff on Indian imports, citing India's continued oil trade with Russia.

India’s Russian Oil Defiance ANGERS Trump; Delhi Gets 24-hour Ultimatum | ‘Stop Buying Now, Or…’

India’s stand on Russia crude oil trade







US President Donald Trump on Tuesday hinted at tariff actions against countries continuing to import energy from Russia, including India and China, ""in a fairly short period of time. ""While stopping short of confirming a 100% tariff, Trump said such measures were under serious consideration.""I never said a percentage, but we'll be doing quite a bit of that. We'll see what happens over the next fairly short period of time,"" Trump said at a White House press conference.""We have a meeting with Russia tomorrow. We're going to see what happens,"" he added.This comes after Trump imposed a 25% tariff and penalty on India for peocuring crude oil from Russia.On Tuesday, Trump had said that he would ‘very substantially’ raise the tariff rate on India. In an interview with CNBC, Trump said, “They're fuelling the war machine, and if they're going to do that, then I'm not going to be happy.""""India has not been a good trading partner, because they do a lot of business with us, but we don't do business with them. So we settled on 25%, but I think I'm going to raise that very substantially over the next 24 hours, because they're buying Russian oil,"" he had said in the interview.Trump had dismissed India's proposal of zero tariffs on American imports, expressing disapproval of India's role in the Ukrainian conflict through its oil trade with Russia.In the interview, Trump had criticised India's existing tariff structure as very high. ""Now, I will say this, India went from the highest tariffs ever. They will give us zero tariffs, and they're going to let us go in.

(AP)

Is the subsidy amount enough?



Bleak outlook for future







As China's population approached 1 billion in the late 1970s, the then Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping introduced the one-child policy in 1979, and China even fined parents for having more children. Four decades later, the government has turned the policy upside down and has decided to pay parents for having more children.In the last week of July, the government announced a new plan to increase the birth rate. Parents will receive an annual subsidy of 3,600 yuan (about $500) for every child until the age of three. This scheme applies to children born since January 1, 2025. Over three years, a family can get up to 10,800 yuan for each child.Beijing’s state broadcaster CCTV called this ""a major nationwide policy aimed at improving public wellbeing,"" as cited by the news agency AFP. ""It provides direct cash subsidies to families across the country, helping to reduce the burden of raising children,"" CCTV added.China’s birth rate has continued to drop, even though the one-child policy was ended nearly ten years ago. Last year, the country recorded only 9.54 million births, which is half the number in 2016, the year the one-child rule ended.China's shrinking population is also ageing fast. There were nearly 310 million people aged 60 and over in 2024.The population shrank by 1.39 million last year, and India surpassed China to become the world’s most populous country in 2023.Marriage rates in China are also very low. Many young couples are not choosing to have children because of the high cost of raising them and concerns about their careers.When asked whether the subsidy would help, one citizen, Li, told American news outlet CNN: ""The cost of raising a child is enormous, and 3,600 yuan a year is a mere drop in the bucket.""A recent study by the YuWa Population Research Institute says it costs around 538,000 yuan ($75,000) to raise a child to age 18 in China. That is over six times China’s GDP per capita. In cities like Shanghai and Beijing, the cost goes beyond 1 million yuan and 936,000 yuan respectively.""(Having kids) would only bring more hardship. I’m not a capitalist or anything, and my kid probably wouldn’t have much of a good life either,"" Li added, as cited by the CNN.China’s economy is slowing, and youth unemployment is rising. These trends are making it harder for the government to encourage people to get married and have children.In 2016, the government allowed couples to have two children, and in 2021, the limit was increased to three. But birth rates kept falling. The population has declined for three years in a row, though there was a small increase in births last year. Experts now say the decline may become worse.The new subsidy will also partially cover children under three who were born before 2025. Some parents have welcomed the policy, but according to CNN, it is unlikely to raise the fertility rate in a meaningful way.Other countries in East Asia, such as Japan and South Korea, have tried similar steps without much success.Many young people in China are dealing with high housing costs, long working hours, and job uncertainty. These problems are seen as bigger reasons why people are not having children.The irony of the shift from fining parents for unsanctioned births to subsidizing them to have more children is not lost on China’s millennials and Gen Zs, especially those who have witnessed the harsh penalties of the one-child policy firsthand, a CNN report said.Some Chinese social media users have pointed out the change in government policy. They have shared old receipts showing the fines their parents had to pay for having them or their siblings during the one-child policy.For many years, as China’s economy grew and living conditions got better, young people believed they would have a better life than their parents. However, that belief is now weakening.Today, many young people who were taught that hard work and education would lead to success are becoming discouraged. Housing prices have gone up a lot, and a university degree no longer guarantees a good job. Good job opportunities are often given to those with family connections, the CNN report said.Many feel that no matter how hard they work, they are not getting ahead in a society that is becoming more competitive. This feeling is often described by the word ""involution,"" which comes from sociology and means a self-defeating cycle of too much competition.In reaction to this, some are choosing to ""lie flat"", a term that means stepping back from trying to meet society’s expectations, including getting married and having children.(This is a top Google Trends topic.)","Parents will receive an annual subsidy of 3,600 yuan (about $500) for every child until the age of three.

Japan, who is known for its supercentenarians, has discovered a fresh longevity icon. At 114 years old, Shigeko Kagawa has earned the distinction of becoming Japan's oldest living person after her predecessor Miyoko Hiroyasu recently passed away. So, what is the secret to Shigeko Kagawa's longevity? We find out. Let's take a look...Shigeko Kagawa was born on 28 May 1911, during a period when Japan experienced profound changes. After finishing her studies at Osaka Women’s Medical College (now Kansai Medical University), she pursued medical practice during an era when women doctors remained scarce. Her life experience combined both challenges and optimism, which developed into her dedication to serve her community and deliver healthcare to others.Ms. Kagawa kickstarted her practice during her twenties, before joining the hospital staff in Osaka during World War II. She sadly remembers the complete destruction of her hometown through air raids and the tragic death of numerous people.She managed her family clinic after the war, while performing the duties of an obstetrician and gynecologist. She always remained on stand by, so she could rush to assist expectant mothers whenever they needed help with emergencies and difficult deliveries throughout the night.Ms. Kagawa dedicated herself to her clinic and community service, until age 86 when she finally retired.Ms. Kagawa chose not to slow down post retirement. In 2021 at 109 years old, Ms. Kagawa achieved the world record as the oldest Olympic torchbearer when she took part in the Tokyo Torch Relay. Through her remarkable achievement, the world media paid attention to her, while motivating everyone regardless of age. Ms. Kagawa finished her section of the relay while seated in a wheelchair, but her enthusiastic smile along with her unwavering determination made her the center of attention.Ms. Kagawa chose to live with her family in Yamatokoriyama Nara Prefecture after her retirement from her home. Every day she follows a standard schedule that includes reading newspapers, and staying informed about news, as well as practicing calligraphy and spending two days at daycare per week. Her daily routine includes consuming three small portions of nutritious food, while keeping her mind active.When asked about her secret to living such a long life, Ms. Kagawa offers a humble and lighthearted answer: “I don’t have any. I just play every day. My energy is my greatest asset. I go wherever I please while eating my preferred foods and pursuing my preferred activities. I’m free and independent”. His longevity lessons are all about sticking to the basics.Her energy comes from her active lifestyle which includes extensive walking, which she practiced before the car became widespread. The doctor used to walk extensively to visit patients since there were no modern cars like today. This practice could have contributed to her robust health and wellness. She bases her approach on these routines, while stressing that older adults need to stay involved while keeping their minds active and open to fresh encounters.The love of her family members serves as the foundation for Ms. Kagawa's happiness. She receives continuous joy through the combination of home support and her friendships with both former patients, and her existing social network. Local officials have honored her outstanding life achievements through official recognition for her dedicated service to the community. Many people find inspiration in her story, which encourages everyone to find value in the present moments regardless of their age.Also See: Longevity: Doing THIS for just one minute everyday can help with longevity! Japan is known for its longevity, with 36 million people aged 65 or older making up 29% of the nation's total population, while the country counts 95,119 centenarians as of September 2024.

Why Taylor Swift’s career is more than music—it’s a masterclass in rewriting the rules

Why Travis Kelce is the real-world echo of Taylor Swift’s philosophy

In an unexpected twist of pop culture meets science, former NASA engineer Sinéad O’Sullivan is breaking down the Taylor Swift phenomenon—through the lens of business and innovation. Her upcoming book Good Ideas and Power Moves: Ten Lessons for Success From Taylor Swift (Penguin Random House, out Sept. 9) argues that Swift’s astronomical rise wasn’t accidental—it was engineered. And according to O’Sullivan, it’s a playbook anyone can learn from, even NFL stars like Travis Kelce who are building brands far beyond the field.The book describes Swift not as a lucky pop princess, but as a “founder of her own multibillion-dollar enterprise,” who outpaces hedge funds and wields more economic influence than many politicians. “Taylor Swift’s genius is not limited to her singing and songcraft,” reads a description of the book.“As the founder of her own multibillion-dollar enterprise, she has higher returns than 99.9% of hedge funds and has built a stronger global corporation than nearly every other American conglomerate CEO. She is the only person that the U.S. Federal Reserve and European Central Bank track with precision. She has a larger impact on the economy than most economists that have ever lived and has done more for U.S.antitrust law than any sitting member of Congress. There is a lot to learn from Taylor Swift.”“Taylor’s story isn’t one of overnight success or unattainable genius,” O’Sullivan writes, according to the Washington Examiner. “It’s a story of deliberate choices, relentless hard work and an unwavering belief in the power of having agency, and of believing in herself enough to use that agency. She has shown that success, no matter how outsize, is within reach for those who are willing to take risks, learn from setbacks, and stay true to their goals. ”This isn’t just about music—it’s about mindset. By taking risks, embracing failure, and refusing to accept industry norms, Swift forged her own economy. And that, O’Sullivan argues, is a formula that transcends entertainment.Travis Kelce, Swift’s high-profile partner and NFL tight end, is no stranger to playing outside the playbook. From hosting Saturday Night Live to launching fashion lines and podcasting ventures, Kelce mirrors Swift’s strategy: diversify, dominate, and do it on your own terms. Their relationship isn’t just a media frenzy—it’s a case study in brand synergy and how two powerhouses can amplify each other’s cultural reach.Swift’s influence, it seems, is spreading far beyond pop charts. As Good Ideas and Power Moves shows, she’s not just a superstar—she’s a strategist rewriting the rules of success. And if Kelce is any indication, others are taking notes.Also Read: Are wedding bells next?

Mumbai: Western Railway conducted the most extensive fortress ticket-checking drive in Indian Railways' history at Borivli station on Tuesday, booking more than 5,100 ticketless and irregular passengers and collecting Rs 13.5 lakh in fines—the highest single-day ticket checking revenue recorded at any station.The operation was part of WR's newly launched NAMASTE Abhiyaan — short for Namrata Aur Strong Ticket Examination — which aims to curb fare evasion through surprise, high-impact enforcement drives. The crackdown at Borivli involved a deployment of 350 personnel, including 300 ticket checking staff, along with Railway Protection Force (RPF) and govt Railway Police (GRP) support.""This is the largest and most focused ticket-checking operation undertaken on Indian Railways at a single station,"" said Vineet Abhishek, chief public relations officer, WR. ""On a regular day, our suburban section sees around 2,600 cases and earns approximately Rs 8 lakh in revenue. Tuesday's drive at Borivli alone surpassed Rs 13 lakh and booked 5,192 cases — an all-time high for any single station.""Ticket checking staff usually work with shoulder bags containing hand-held terminals (HHTs) and Excess Fare Ticket (EFT) books, making it difficult to navigate overcrowded coaches and AC locals, especially during peak hours.Under NAMASTE, WR has introduced specially designed protective vests that securely hold essential devices like HHTs, EFTs, body cameras, and compact speakers for onboard announcements.""These new vests will significantly improve the mobility and safety of our ticket checking staff,"" Abhishek said. ""They allow devices to be strapped close to the body, reducing clutter and enabling better access in crowded conditions.""WR is also establishing pre-custody areas at major suburban stations to streamline the handling of ticketless or unruly passengers. These zones will operate under CCTV surveillance and follow standardised documentation protocols, reducing congestion at head ticket-checking offices and ensuring greater transparency.Abhishek added that the NAMASTE Abhiyaan will continue with more such surprise drives across key stations in Mumbai to reinforce ticket discipline and improve the overall travel experience for genuine commuters.","Western Railway conducted the most extensive ticket-checking drive in Indian Railways' history at Borivli station.

Poll Do you support the new setback regulations for buildings in Bengaluru? Yes No





BENGALURU: In a move that will significantly impact future constructions across the tech capital, the state govt has notified an amendment to zonal regulations under the Revised Master Plan (RMP) 2015. The amendment, in effect from Aug 1, lays down clear and updated setback norms for buildings across the city, particularly focusing on structures taller than 12 metres.Setback, which refers to the minimum open space required between a building and the property's boundary, has been a long-contested urban planning issue in the city, where rapid vertical growth has outpaced regulatory clarity. The new norms aim to address ambiguities by specifying setback requirements based on building height and whether a stilt floor (typically used for parking) is included.According to the new regulations, all types of buildings on a plot size of up to 4,000sqm are supposed to leave a minimum setback area of 1.5m in the front and 1m each on the sides and the rear. For buildings on a plot size of more than 4,000sqm, the minimum setback area on the front, rear, and sides is 5m. For buildings with 12 to 15 floors but without a stilt floor, the setback area mandated is 5m. However, the setback requirement increases for buildings with 15-plus floors, depending on height (see box).This codified gradation aims to ensure that taller buildings allow more open space around them, contributing to better light, ventilation, and emergency access.The amendment also throws more clarity on stilt floors. When stilt parking is provided, the height of the stilt floor shall be up to 3m, measured from floor to floor. Crucially, this floor's height will not be counted towards the building's total height, provided the overall height remains below 15m.The new regulations apply to all new constructions, including ongoing work for which plan approvals and modified plan approvals have been granted. In case of existing structures and buildings under construction, the ground floor may be converted into stilt parking and height of the stilt floor shall not be considered for computing the total height of the building. In such cases, a modified plan or sanction for alteration may be approved accordingly. However, the height of stilt floor shouldn't exceed 3m in any case,"" the final notification adds.","The state govt has notified an amendment to zonal regulations under the Revised Master Plan (RMP) 2015. The amendment, in effect from Aug 1, lays down clear and updated setback norms for buildings across the city. Setback, which refers to the minimum open space required between a building and the property's boundary, has been a long-contested urban planning issue.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123133250,imgsize-238820,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/123133250.jpg"

Tesla’s defense: distracted driving

Implications for Tesla’s Autopilot safety record



Broader consequences for Tesla’s legal exposure





A Florida jury has ordered Tesla to pay $243 million in damages to the family of a 22-year-old woman who died in a 2019 crash involving a Model S sedan equipped with Tesla’s Autopilot driver-assistance technology. The case, centered around allegations that Tesla’s Autopilot system failed to prevent the fatal collision, marks one of the largest verdicts ever against the electric vehicle giant. While Tesla argued that driver behavior caused the accident, the jury found the company partly liable for the death, amplifying concerns about the safety of Tesla’s semi-autonomous driving technology.In April 2019, George McGee was driving a 2019 Tesla Model S near Key Largo, Florida, with Autopilot engaged. McGee dropped his phone and bent down to retrieve it, diverting attention from the road. The vehicle failed to detect a parked Chevrolet Tahoe at an intersection, and McGee did not brake or steer away. The Tesla struck a couple standing nearby—22-year-old Naibel Benavides Leon, who died, and her boyfriend Dillon Angulo, who suffered severe injuries.The plaintiff’s attorneys contended that Tesla’s Autopilot was defective, focusing on its inability to detect stationary vehicles at intersections and its design limitations for controlled-access highways only.Tesla’s promotion of Autopilot as highly capable, without adequate warnings about these limits, was a critical issue.Tesla maintained that the crash was primarily the result of driver distraction and error. McGee admitted to looking for his dropped phone moments before the collision and was traveling at approximately 62 mph in a 45 mph zone. Tesla emphasized that no vehicle could have avoided the accident under those conditions and stated that their cars meet all required safety standards.This verdict arrives amidst growing scrutiny of Tesla’s Autopilot and Full Self-Driving (FSD) technologies. Critics argue the ruling highlights real safety risks associated with Tesla’s autonomous driving systems, especially outside limited highway conditions. The company’s liability in this high-profile case may lead to heightened regulatory attention and encourage further litigation related to its driver assistance technology.The $243 million verdict includes $200 million in punitive damages and $43 million in compensatory damages, with Tesla found 33% responsible for the incident. The driver was found 67% liable but is not financially responsible as he was not a defendant. Legal experts see this verdict as a pivotal precedent regarding automaker accountability for semi-autonomous driving system failures. Tesla has announced plans to appeal the decision.",A Florida jury has ordered Tesla to pay $243 million in damages to the family of a 22-year-old woman who died in a 2019 crash.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has shifted from being a futuristic concept to a rapidly evolving reality impacting every industry. With advanced machine learning models, automation systems, and AI-powered decision-making tools, tasks once performed by humans are now handled with speed and precision by algorithms. This has triggered global concern about potential job losses. Top tech leaders have issued warnings that AI will significantly disrupt the workforce. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has admitted that automation will reduce certain jobs within the company. Similarly, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated that AI will impact “everybody’s jobs” in some capacity, although he expects it to also create new opportunities. Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis predicts the most dramatic changes will occur within the next five to ten years, transforming entire job markets.When asked about the possibility of artificial general intelligence (AGI) performing all human tasks, DeepMind CEO Hassabis highlighted an important distinction:AI could analyse medical data, scans, and test results faster and more accurately than human doctors, potentially replacing or assisting in diagnosis and treatment planning.Nurses, however, provide emotional support, physical care, and human empathy that technology can’t replicate. A robotic nurse may be efficient but lacks the ability to emotionally connect with patients, a critical part of caregiving.This example shows that while AI in healthcare may replace certain intellectual tasks, professions relying on emotional intelligence will remain human-centered. This statement from Hassabis offers one of the clearest examples of how AI will alter specific professions, but not eliminate the need for human empathy and interpersonal care.According to Hassabis, the workplace of the future will integrate humans and AI collaboratively. AI will handle data-heavy, repetitive, and analytical processes, allowing humans to focus on creative problem-solving, emotional interaction, and leadership roles. This shift will require governments and industries to invest heavily in reskilling programs to prepare workers for AI-driven environments, emphasizing lifelong learning, adaptive skills, ethical AI usage, and the development of new interdisciplinary roles bridging technology, creativity, and human-centric decision-making.Andy Jassy’s remarks highlight a future where AI automation tools replace repetitive and operational tasks. Amazon already relies on robotics and intelligent software to manage logistics, inventory, and supply chain processes. Jassy believes that as these technologies mature, fewer human workers will be required for jobs like order processing and warehouse management. However, he noted that the shift doesn’t necessarily mean fewer opportunities overall but rather a need for upskilling and reskilling so employees can transition into more technology-driven roles.Jensen Huang, whose company Nvidia provides the graphics processing units (GPUs) powering modern AI systems, offered a candid view on AI’s impact:“Everybody’s jobs will be affected. Some jobs will be lost. Many jobs will be created.” Huang believes AI’s productivity gains will help industries perform tasks faster and cheaper, which may reduce demand for certain roles but open new ones focused on AI development, data analysis, and advanced engineering. He expressed hope that economic growth from AI adoption will ultimately “lift society” rather than harm it.Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind and a key architect of advanced AI systems, views AI as an additive rather than purely disruptive technology. He explained that as AI capabilities expand, new job categories will emerge—roles that use AI to enhance human output rather than replace it entirely. Historically, technological revolutions (like industrial machines or computers) displaced certain jobs but also created industries that didn’t exist before. Hassabis believes this trend will continue:“New jobs will be created that are actually better, that utilise these tools or new technologies.”AI can handle data analysis, diagnostics, and treatment recommendations faster than humans, but doctors will still oversee complex decision-making and patient care.Nursing requires emotional support, hands-on care, and human empathy—qualities that machines and robots cannot replicate effectively.He predicts massive workplace changes within 5–10 years, with some jobs disappearing and new ones emerging.Amazon CEO Andy Jassy expects automation to cut some jobs, while Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang believes AI will affect “everybody’s jobs” but also create new opportunities.Roles focused on AI development, creative problem-solving, emotional intelligence, and advanced data management are expected to increase.",Top tech leaders have issued warnings that AI will significantly disrupt the workforce.

Newlyweds Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez were recently spotted hosting Leonardo DiCaprio and his model girlfriend Vittoria Ceretti aboard their $485 million superyacht Koru . The high-profile outing took place off the coast of Ibiza, a popular celebrity hotspot and luxury summer getaway destination. Leonardo DiCaprio, known for his understated style, wore a plain white T-shirt, shorts, and his trademark baseball cap and sunglasses. Vittoria Ceretti showcased her model figure in a strapless blue top and black yoga pants. Bezos opted for tropical-printed swim trunks paired with a navy T-shirt, while Sánchez layered a printed kimono over a bikini. Their casual vacation looks perfectly captured the relaxed yet exclusive atmosphere aboard one of the world’s most extravagant and expensive private yachts, making headlines among luxury lifestyle and celebrity news followers worldwide.Bezos’s superyacht Koru, meaning “new beginnings” in Māori, represents the couple’s extravagant lifestyle and new chapter together. Built by Dutch shipbuilder Oceanco, Koru stands as the world’s tallest sailing yacht, measuring 250 feet tall with three masts exceeding 230 feet each.At 416 feet wide, the yacht features three luxury decks, multiple lounges, and ultra-modern amenities. Its construction spanned five years, costing an estimated $485 million. The yacht previously sparked controversy when plans to dismantle a historic Rotterdam bridge emerged to allow Koru’s passage, leading to widespread public protests and alternative solutions by the builders.Leonardo DiCaprio’s attendance at Bezos and Sánchez’s Venetian wedding drew backlash, with critics calling him a “hypocrite” due to his outspoken environmental activism. Social media users highlighted the contradiction between DiCaprio’s climate advocacy and the carbon-heavy nature of celebrity private jet travel, pointing out that over 90 jets reportedly flew into Venice for the wedding.Despite the criticism, DiCaprio’s friendship with Bezos remains strong, as evidenced by their repeat vacations together including last year’s luxury yacht trip in Sardinia. One of the wedding’s most surprising attendees was Sydney Sweeney, who reportedly had no close personal connection to Bezos or Sánchez. Later reports revealed that Bezos and Sánchez are investing in Sweeney’s upcoming lingerie line, explaining her presence at the event. This move demonstrates how the Bezos-Sánchez social circle extends beyond personal relationships to professional collaborations, further solidifying their influence in both business and Hollywood circles.The Bezos-Sánchez lifestyle showcases a blend of ultra-luxury living, A-list networking, and strategic business alliances. Whether it’s a $40 million Venetian wedding, a $485 million yacht, or investments in rising Hollywood talent, the couple has firmly positioned themselves at the center of celebrity culture and high society.Just weeks before their Ibiza yacht trip, Bezos and Sánchez tied the knot in an opulent $40 million wedding in Venice. The three-day celebration attracted global headlines not just for its extravagance but also for the massive celebrity turnout, including Oprah Winfrey, Orlando Bloom, and Sydney Sweeney.Despite public protests in Venice over the event’s scale, insiders revealed that the wedding was surprisingly intimate. No non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) were required for guests, allowing attendees to freely share their experiences. The bride’s $5 million diamond ring became a symbol of the wedding’s lavishness and continues to be a topic of discussion among jewelers and fans alike.","Bezos-Sánchez lifestyle showcases blend of ultra-luxury living, A-list networking, and strategic business alliances.

Tim Cook: Four new Apple stores coming to major Indian cities



Apple retail growth accelerates globally with strong focus on India and the Middle East

Apple is preparing to significantly increase its retail presence across India, marking another step in its long-term strategy to strengthen its footprint in emerging markets. During Apple’s latest earnings announcement, CEO Tim Cook confirmed plans to open multiple new Apple Stores in India before the year ends. The move comes as part of a broader global expansion plan that also includes fresh Apple retail outlets in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the launch of the Apple Store Online in Saudi Arabia. Cook highlighted that these new physical stores are a key step in improving Apple’s customer experience, product accessibility, and service reach in high-growth regions like India.“We recently launched the Apple Store online in Saudi Arabia, and we couldn’t be more excited to open new stores in the UAE and India later this year,” Cook stated. “We were also delighted to welcome customers in Japan to a new location in the heart of Osaka.”According to Apple Magazine, four new stores are scheduled to open across key metropolitan cities in India, namely Bengaluru, Mumbai, Pune, and the Delhi NCR region. These new outlets will build on Apple’s successful retail debut in India in 2023, which saw the launch of Apple BKC in Mumbai and Apple Saket in Delhi. These initial stores have quickly become major crowd-pullers, especially during new iPhone release events, and have demonstrated the value of physical retail locations in India’s fast-growing premium smartphone market.To support this retail growth, Apple has been actively hiring talent for its upcoming stores. Earlier this year, Apple Store leader John Taffe shared on LinkedIn that Apple was looking for passionate and skilled individuals to join its retail team. “Apple’s journey in India has been incredible, and we’re thrilled to continue growing in these vibrant cities. To make these new stores a success, we’re looking for passionate and talented individuals to join our team,” Taffe noted. This hiring drive highlights Apple’s commitment to not only selling products but also delivering personalised customer experiences and creating jobs within the Indian retail sector.While India remains a critical market, Apple is expanding its retail network globally. Apart from its Indian plans, the company has announced new retail locations in the UAE, including a store in Al Ain, which will add to its existing four UAE outlets (two in Abu Dhabi and two in Dubai). The Apple Store Online in Saudi Arabia further emphasizes Apple’s growing focus on the Middle East.These international retail initiatives aim to strengthen Apple’s customer reach and brand experience beyond its digital ecosystem. Apple’s global retail growth is supported by its strong financial results. In its April–June quarter (Q3), Apple reported a 13% year-over-year increase in iPhone sales, showcasing robust demand even in challenging economic conditions. This financial strength gives Apple the confidence to invest heavily in physical stores in markets like India, where premium smartphone adoption is rapidly increasing.India has emerged as one of Apple’s most important growth markets, driven by rising disposable incomes, expanding smartphone penetration, and a growing preference for premium devices. The launch of Apple BKC and Apple Saket in 2023 marked the company’s first direct retail presence in the country, and the overwhelming customer response has paved the way for more stores. Apple’s upcoming four new stores signal a long-term commitment to India, where it faces strong competition from brands like Samsung and OnePlus. However, Apple’s focus on a seamless retail experience and exclusive customer service could help it capture a larger market share in the premium category.",Apple is preparing to significantly increase its retail presence across India.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.
