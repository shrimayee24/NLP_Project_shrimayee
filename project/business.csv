Raise strength of women judges: Ex-CJI,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/raise-strength-of-women-judges-ex-cji/articleshow/123742116.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a sharp reminder to the SC Collegium and the Centre about gender diversity in constitutional courts, former CJI N V Ramana Saturday said making a noise about gender without giving proper representation to women in the constitutional courts would amount to nothing but tokenism.At a symposium at SRM School of Law, Justice Ramana said in the last 75 years, SC has had only 11 women judges, of whom three had taken oath four years ago on Aug 31, 2021, when he was the CJI. Of them twos have retired and the third one, Justice B V Nagarathna, will become first woman CJI in Sept 2027 for a very short period of 36 days. ""Our institutions must reflect our social fabric. Gender diversity and inclusivity is not tokenism. It is a necessity to enrich our perspectives with social realities. This issue needs a larger consideration. Inclusivity does not happen naturally... Bringing in inclusivity calls for concerted efforts at the highest level,"" he said.Justice Ramana highlighted how infrastructure issues had forced National Company Law Tribunal to issue a public notice on Sept 3 regarding the shutting down of three of its six courtrooms and said that during his tenure as CJI he had tried to persuade the govt and other stakeholders to create a National Judicial Infrastructure Authority to assess and supervise creation of adequate infrastructure for the three-tier justice delivery mechanism.The efforts did not fructify.The ex-CJI's plea for expeditious implementation of SC Collegium's recommendations for appointments to constitutional courts was taken forward by advocate A M Singhvi, who said for decades the HCs have been functioning with two-thirds of their sanctioned strength and the trial courts operate with four-fifths of their capacity of 25,000 judges.He said pendency of cases is directly linked to vacancy for judges in trial courts and HCs. Singhvi highlighted that govt and SC have worked out an MoP as per the law laid down by SC, which mandated govt has to expeditiously appoint candidates recommended by the SC Collegium.","Former CJI N V Ramana said making a noise about gender without giving proper representation to women in the constitutional courts would amount to nothing but tokenism.

US President Donald Trump signed an executive order that will grant tariff exemptions from Monday to trading partners who reach agreements on industrial exports.The move covers key materials such as nickel, gold, pharmaceutical compounds and chemicals, according to Reuters.Since taking office, Trump has spent his first seven months raising tariffs sharply as part of his effort to reshape the global trading system, cut US trade deficits and push partner nations into making concessions.The new directive identifies more than 45 categories of goods that will qualify for zero import tariffs from “aligned partners” who agree to framework deals reducing Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs and duties imposed under the Section 232 national security law.It also brings US tariffs into line with commitments under existing arrangements with allies including Japan and the European Union. The exemptions for countries covered by these agreements will begin at 12:01 AM EDT (0401 GMT) on Monday.In the order, Trump notes that any decision to reduce tariffs will hinge on the “scope and economic value of a trading partner’s commitments to the United States in its agreement on reciprocal trade” and broader US national interests.According to the White House, the tariff cuts apply to goods that “cannot be grown, mined, or naturally produced in the United States” or where domestic production is insufficient. Officials said the order also introduces carveouts for certain agricultural products, aircraft and parts, and non-patented pharmaceutical articles.Once a reciprocal trade deal is in place, the US trade representative, Commerce Department and customs will have authority to waive tariffs on qualifying imports without requiring a new executive order, a White House official added.The zero-tariff list includes graphite and different forms of nickel, crucial for stainless steel manufacturing and electric vehicle batteries. It also covers pharmaceutical compounds such as lidocaine, used as an anaesthetic, and reagents used in medical diagnostic testing, as per Reuters.Gold imports in multiple forms, including powders, leaf and bullion, are also exempted. Switzerland, a major supplier, has been hit by tariffs of 39% as it has not yet secured a deal with Washington.Other categories benefiting from the changes are natural graphite, neodymium magnets and LEDs. At the same time, the order scraps earlier exemptions for certain plastics and polysilicon, a material vital for solar panels.","US President Donald Trump signed an executive order that will grant tariff exemptions from Monday.

‘Crap Note’: Navarro Slams Musk After His X Post On India’s Russian Oil Purchases Gets Fact-Checked

US Official Claims India Will Backtrack On Tariff, Russian Oil, BRICS And Say Sorry To Donald Trump

""NEW DELHI: Senior White House adviser Peter Navarro on Saturday alleged that India did not purchase Russian oil before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, while reiterating his claim that New Delhi buys it solely to profiteer.In a post on X, Navarro wrote, “Wow. @elonmusk is letting propaganda into people's posts. That crap note below is just that. Crap. India buys Russia oil solely to profiteer. It didn't buy any before Russia invaded Ukraine. Indian govt spin machine moving high tilt. Stop killing Ukranians. Stop taking American jobs.”The remarks follow a post on Friday in which Navarro said: “India highest tariffs costs U.S. jobs. India buys Russian oil purely to profit/Revenues feed Russia war machine. Ukrainians/Russians die. U.S. taxpayers shell out more. India can't handle truth/spins. Leftist American fake news.”Also read: Trump aide Navarro takes fresh swipe at India over Russian oil; blames tariffs for US job losses Navarro was angered by a Community Note on X that appeared below his post, which said, “India's Russian oil purchases are for energy security, not just profit, & don't violate sanctions. While India has some tariffs, the U.S. has a trade surplus with it in services. U.S. also continues to import certain commodities from Russia which is hypocritical.”Community Notes are created by contributors on X to provide additional context to potentially misleading posts. If enough contributors from different points of view rate a note as helpful, it becomes publicly visible.Navarro has repeatedly criticised India for continuing trade with Moscow, calling the conflict “Modi’s war,” labeling the country “Kremlin’s laundromat,” and alleging it profits from the war. In an interview with Bloomberg Television last week, he said: “India is helping feed the Russian war machine. I mean Modi's war, because the road to peace runs, in part, through New Delhi.”The ministry of external affairs (MEA) rejected Navarro’s comments. Spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, “We have seen the inaccurate and misleading statements made by Navarro, and obviously, we reject them. We remain focused on the substantive agenda that our two countries have committed to, and we hope that the relationship will continue to move forward based on mutual respect and shared interests.”Earlier on Friday, White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett said that President Donald Trump and his trade team were “disappointed” with India’s continued imports of Russian crude oil but expressed hope for “positive developments.”","White House adviser Peter Navarro on Saturday alleged that India did not purchase Russian oil before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

This comes as assembly elections in states like West Bengal, Kerala, Assam, Tamil Nadu, along with Puducherry are set to take place in 2026, indicating the possibility of SIR in these states by the year-end.The intensive revision aims to identify and remove illegal foreign migrants by verifying place of birth, a step gaining importance amid crackdowns on migrants from Bangladesh and Myanmar in several states. Meanwhile, the opposition has accused the Centre of targeting Bengali-speaking people across country, calling them illegal immigrants from Bangladesh.The revision of the voters’ list in Bihar drew criticism from opposition parties, who alleged that the exercise could disenfranchise crores of eligible citizens due to lack of proper documents.The Election Commission introduced additional measures in the ongoing intensive revision of electoral rolls to address concerns over the enrollment of illegal migrants. These steps came amid opposition allegations that the poll panel has manipulated voter data to favor the ruling party.As part of the new measures, an additional declaration form has been made mandatory for certain applicants, particularly those seeking to register as voters or shift their enrollment from outside the state. Applicants are required to declare that they were born in India before July 1, 1987, and furnish supporting documents to establish their date and place of birth.For those born between July 1, 1987, and December 2, 2004, the declaration process requires submission of documents proving the date and place of birth of their parents. These safeguards, the Commission maintains, are designed to ensure that foreign nationals do not get included in the country’s voters’ list.","The Election Commission is set to meet on September 10 to discuss the preparedness of a pan-India rollout of special intensive revision (SIR) of voters' list.

The bench allowed an appeal filed by Union govt, holding that a renunciation certificate from Pakistan is indispensable and cannot be replaced by other documents.""The Citizenship Act, 1955, does not recognise dual citizenship,"" the court said. ""An individual can be treated as an Indian citizen only if recognised exclusively by the Indian state, without competing claims from any other country.""The case dates back to 2008 when the women's father Muhamed Maroof returned to India from Pakistan with govt permission.

India-UK Deal On Economic Offenders: PM Modi Pushes Starmer to Extradite Mallya, Nirav, Lalit Modi

NEW DELHI: A delegation from Britain’s crown prosecution service (CPS) recently inspected Tihar Jail in New Delhi, as part of India’s efforts to convince UK courts to clear the extradition of fugitives wanted on financial and criminal charges, reported news agency ANI.According to people familiar with the matter, the CPS team visited the high-security ward of Tihar and interacted with inmates. Indian authorities assured the delegation that international fugitives brought back to India would be housed in safe conditions and, if required, a special “enclave” could be built inside the jail to accommodate high-profile prisoners.The inspection comes against the backdrop of repeated objections raised by British courts in the past, which have rejected India’s extradition requests citing concerns about prison conditions. To address these hurdles, India has guaranteed that no accused will be subjected to illegal interrogation while in custody.Currently, 178 extradition requests by India are pending abroad, of which nearly 20 are with the United Kingdom. These include cases of arms dealers and individuals linked to Khalistani groups.Among the most high-profile cases are those of fugitive liquor baron Vijay Mallya , accused of defaulting on over Rs 9,000 crore in bank loans, and diamond merchant Nirav Modi , the prime accused in the Rs 13,800 crore Punjab National Bank fraud.Modi, arrested in London in March 2019, has already had his extradition approved by the UK High Court but continues to remain in custody.In July this year, foreign secretary Vikram Misri reiterated that the Indian government was “making the case” with British authorities to fast-track the return of fugitives. India maintains that extradited individuals will be kept under humane conditions in Tihar and other facilities, in line with international standards.",A delegation from Britain’s crown prosecution service (CPS) recently inspected Tihar Jail in New Delhi.

The report also cited an investigation by ED into a darknet-based Fentanyl syndicate in its 'best practices' section, emphasising the significance of joint investigations.The joint probe by ED and US' department of justice (DOJ), it said, had led to the dismantling of a major drug trafficking organisation which was laundering proceeds through virtual assets. Elaborating on the case, it said that in 2022, DOJ had sought assistance from the Indian govt under the Treaty on Mutual Legal Assistance in criminal matters to investigate a major drug trafficking organisation led by two brothers.The investigation, according to FATF, revealed that the brothers controlled over 8,500 bitcoins, valued at $150 million at the time, which were used for money laundering and to finance drug trafficking activities. The organisation concealed these assets and its activities through complex transactions involving cryptocurrency exchanges and dark web platforms.Responding to the US' request, ED had launched a parallel investigation focused on the organisation's financial networks and obtained key financial records uncovering transfers, through a digital payment service provider, exceeding Rs 5.5 crore to the entity.In April and May 2024, searches led to seizure of 268.2 bitcoins, worth Rs 130 crore, which were frozen, along with the provisional attachment of assets worth Rs 9.6 crore.""This case is a strong example of real-time, cross-border co-ordination between the authorities of India and the US. US officials travelled to India to assist in the investigation, including during interviews of the accused, contributing significantly to its progress,"" the report said.Additionally, home ministry has established a set of standardised guidelines for international co-operation which provide a clear and structured framework for managing incoming and outgoing MLA requests, it noted. ""By establishing a predictable and legally compliant process, the online MLA portal has enhanced India's capacity to work with foreign nations, reducing delays and miscommunication, while ensuring timely and effective responses to requests for legal assistance,"" it further said.","The Financial Action Task Force's (FATF's) latest report has appreciated the efforts of Union home ministry's online portal for Mutual Legal Assistance (MLA) The report also cited an investigation by ED into a darknet-based Fentanyl syndicate in its 'best practices' section, emphasising the significance of joint investigations.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123742191,imgsize-24638,width-400,resizemode-4/fatf.jpg"

There was a silver lining though - there were indications of a significant decline in mercury levels in Delhi during the period studied, compared with previous years.The global or natural background value of mercury in clean air is about 1.7 ng/m³ in the Northern Hemisphere and 1.3 ng/m³ in the Southern Hemisphere.The first-of-its-kind study - published recently in the journal Air Quality, Atmosphere & Health, by Springer - analysed data from 2018 to 2024 on gaseous elemental mercury, a key atmospheric pollutant. Researchers reported that Delhi's air contained, on an average, 6.9±4.2 nanograms of mercury per cubic metre (ng/m³), compared to 2.1±0.7 ng/m³ in Ahmedabad and 1.5 ±0.4 ng/m³ in Pune.This means each cubic metre of air in Delhi - roughly the amount a person breathes in an hour at rest - carries around 7 billionths of a gram of mercury on an average, compared to about 2 billionths in Ahmedabad and 1.5 billionths in Pune.Delhi's peak values were nearly 13 times higher than the global background level. The research team attributed 72%-92% of mercury in these cities to human activities. ""Seasonal and nighttime spikes were especially prominent in Delhi and Ahmedabad during winter, linked to coal use, stubble burning, and stable atmospheric conditions,"" a scientist from IITM said.""Mercury is among the top 10 chemicals of major public health concern, according to WHO. Even in small amounts, if exposure continues for 5-10 years, it can be dangerous. Long-term inhalation mainly affects the nervous system, digestive system, immune system, kidneys and lungs,"" said Gufran Beig, chair professor at National Institute of Advanced Studies, IISc.

CHANDIGARH: Devastating floods in Punjab have severely hampered the state's desperate efforts to expand its diminishing green cover. The forest and wildlife preservation department has reported the loss of 4,94,956 trees over nearly 776 hectares in the current floods - the worst in 37 years.The India State of Forest Report (ISFR) 2023 estimates the state's forest cover at 1,846 sq km, just 3.7% of its geographical area of about 50.3 lakh hectares. With nearly 83% of the land under cultivation, there is little scope for expanding forest cover.The forest department has pegged the damage at about Rs 341.3 lakh. However, officials cautioned that these are only preliminary estimates, and the figure may rise once the floodwaters recede and the full extent of destruction is assessed.A memorandum prepared by principal chief conservator of forests Dharminder Sharma for submission to the inter-ministerial central team also noted damage to 10 departmental buildings, adding another Rs 19.2 lakh in losses.

"Modi, Trump have always been good friends, says EAM",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/modi-trump-have-always-been-good-friends-says-eam/articleshow/123741793.cms,"S Jaishankar To Join BRICS Online Summit As Member Nations Unite Against Trump’s Tariff War

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi lost no time in deeply appreciating and reciprocating US President Donald Trump's sentiments, including his ""positive assessment"" of ties, suggesting this might be the moment both sides can use to turn the tide of negativity in the relationship that nosedived into the ground under Trump after scaling soaring peaks in the past 20 years.Shortly thereafter, external affairs minister S Jaishankar amplified the message by saying Modi attaches enormous importance to the partnership with the US and always had a very good personal equation with Trump. ""But the point is that we remain engaged with the US, and at this time, I can't say more than that. But that's really what I would say,"" said the minister, who will travel to New York this month to participate in the 80th UN General Assembly (UNGA) session.The development opens up the possibility of a phone call between the leaders, although diplomatic sources did not confirm if there was any such proposal yet. A bilateral meeting on the margins of the UNGA would have come in handy for seeking a reaffirmation from Trump of his commitment to the partnership, but the latest list of speakers released late on Friday suggested Jaishankar, and not Modi, would lead the Indian delegation.Also read: PM Modi reacts to Donald Trump's remarks on India-US ties amid tariff row India had in July reserved a slot for the head of govt to address the UNGA on Sept 26. It has now told the Assembly that India's national statement will be delivered at the minister-level (Jaishankar). However, should the PM change his mind, he can still travel to New York as the latest list too is only provisional.For its own sake though, India will hope Trump will stand by his latest remarks, unlike on India-Pakistan truce where he reportedly walked back his ceasefire claims, only to let loose a verbal torrent asserting he indeed ended the armed conflict between the two countries.Amid all the talk about a possible shift in India's foreign policy and global realignment, particularly after the SCO summit, the MEA has stressed India cherishes its strategic partnership with the US and wants to carry it forward on the basis of shared interests and mutual respect. However, the govt remains wary of senior Trump administration officials' unprovoked and incessant tirades against India on not just trade but a range of issues, which has seen India ending up as the favourite whipping boy of Trump's MAGA support base, and will wait to see if Trump's latest remarks will put an end to this. Apart from the strife over trade and ties with Russia, India also has to contend with Trump's courting of China, an immigration overhaul that would hurt Indian IT professionals and his dalliance with Pakistan.In quite literally an overnight shift from one extreme to another, Trump and Modi moved to quell the firestorm that has already singed the relationship as the former, hours after having declared India had been lost to China, said there was nothing to worry about in India-US ties.","US President Donald Trump said there was nothing to worry about in India-US ties.

Pan-India SIR to be announced later this month?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pan-india-sir-exercise-will-be-spread-over-a-month/articleshow/123741788.cms,"NEW DELHI: The annual summary revision of the electoral roll countrywide, with reference to Jan 1, 2026 as the qualifying date, is likely to be converted into a pan-India special intensive revision (SIR) exercise on the lines of the one in Bihar, reports Bharti Jain.A clear indication of this has come with EC convening a meeting with chief electoral officers of all states and UTs on Sept 10 to discuss modalities of the pan-India SIR exercise. The details sought include current electorate strength and that during the last SIR, qualifying date of last SIR and whether rolls from last SIR have been digitised and uploaded on the CEO's website.EC will also hear the CEOs' suggestions on any additional documents to prove citizenship and the rationalisation of polling stations (PS) to limit number of electors per PS to 1,200; and the status of appointment and training of electoral registration officers (ERO), additional EROs and booth level officers (BLOs).The pan-India SIR exercise will require electors across all states and Union Territories (UTs), barring Bihar, to fill and submit signed enumeration forms, with or without documentation as per the criteria to be laid down by EC in its pan-India SIR order expected sometime later this month or early next month.EC had declared its decision to conduct SIR in the entire country ""for the discharge of its constitutional mandate to protect the integrity of electoral rolls"" in its order dated June 24, 2025.However, it chose to start the exercise with Bihar in view of the impending assembly poll there, while announcing that the schedule for the rest of the country would be issued ""separately in due course"".Though there was speculation that SIR would follow next in the four states and a UT - Assam, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Puducherry - due for polls in April 2026, there is now ample indication that EC does not want to waste its resources or duplicate efforts with two pan-India roll revision exercises - the special summary revision that is done between Oct and Dec each year and the pan-India SIR, which can be conducted within the same timeframe.It will be interesting to see what cutoff date EC decides for other state/UT rolls, based on which the BLOs will distribute the pre-filled enumeration forms to electors through house visits. Some states like West Bengal have already stepped up the issue of documents accepted in SIR.The pan-India enumeration exercise will be spread over a month. A draft roll shall then be published and claims and objections accepted over the next one month. These will be disposed of in the following 25 days and the final rolls for all states/UTs published in early Jan 2026. Last year, the annual summary revision of rolls with reference to Jan 1, 2025, had started on October 29, 2024; however, SIR would need to start a month earlier to accommodate the enumeration phase.As in the case of SIR in Bihar, those included in the final rolls of their respective state/UT published after the last intensive revision undertaken in 2003-04 will be presumed as citizens and only need to submit their signed enumeration forms without any documents. The remaining electors, however, will need to attach documents specified by the commission to prove their eligibility as per Article 326 of the Constitution - being at least 18 years of age and a citizen of India.EC maintains that the purpose of SIR is to purify the rolls by weeding out electors who are dead, permanently shifted, enrolled at multiple places or non-citizens. The preparation of electoral roll must ensure that all eligible citizens are included and all ineligible persons excluded, as per EC officials.","EC convenes meeting with chief electoral officers of all states and UTs on Sept 10 to discuss modalities of the pan-India SIR exercise.

Of them two have retired and third one, Justice Nagarathna, will become first woman CJI in Sept 2027 for a very short period of 36 days.""Our institutions must reflect our social fabric.

Singhvi highlighted that the govt and SC have worked out an MoP as per the law laid down by SC, which mandated that the govt has to expeditiously appoint candidates recommended by SC Collegium. In case the govt returns a name with objections but the SC reiterates the candidature, then the govt has no option but to appoint that person as HC judge.","N V Ramana said making a noise about gender without giving proper representation to women in constitutional courts would amount to nothing but tokenism.

Trump’s New Message To India As Modi Hails ‘Privileged’ Ties With Putin; ‘It’s Getting Late’

US President Donald Trump on Friday said that he will always be friends with Prime Minister Narendra Modi but added that he does not like what PM Modi is doing at this particular moment.While talking to reporters at the Oval Office, Trump said that the Washington and New Delhi shares a ""very special relationship"" and adding that there is ""nothing to worry about"" in the ties between the two countries.""I always will. I'll always be friends with (PM) Modi. He's a great Prime Minister. I'll always be friends, but I just don't like what he is doing at this particular moment.

We just have moments on occasion,"" he added.Trump also responded to his earlier post on Truth Social, where he said the US had ""lost India and Russia to China.""""I've been very disappointed that India would be buying so much oil from Russia. I let them know that. We put a very big tariff on India- 50 per cent, very high tariff. I get along very well with (PM) Modi as you know. He was here couple of months ago, in fact we went to the Rose Garden and had a press conference,"" he said.This comes after Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently attended the SCO summit in China amid the ongoing tussle with US over 50% tariffs.Trump has imposed 25 per cent reciprocal tariffs on India and an additional 25 per cent for Delhi’s purchases of Russian oil.India has termed the tariffs imposed on it as “unjustified and unreasonable.”“Like any major economy, India will take all necessary measures to safeguard its national interests and economic security,” India has said.Meanwhile, on Friday, the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that most of Trump's sweeping global tariffs are unlawful.","US President Donald Trump on Friday said that he will always be friends with Prime Minister Narendra Modi but added that he does not like what PM Modi is doing at this particular moment.

India’s Surprise Strategic Game Plan For Upcoming UN General Assembly

Poll Should India prioritize trade talks with the US over participating in high-stakes meetings? Yes, prioritize trade talks No, high-stakes meetings are more important

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar will travel to New York this month for the 80th session of the UN General Assembly (UNGA) but suspense remains about PM Narendra Modi 's participation. The ministry of external affairs did not confirm who will lead the delegation.TOI had reported on July 24 that India had reserved a slot for the PM to address the UNGA on Sept 26. However, the provisional list of speakers is not always a reliable guide about who might deliver India's national statement. In the past too, the head of govt has been inscribed on the list of speakers only to later have the EAM fill in for the PM.According to sources, UNGA is not a part of PM's travel schedule for now, and things are likely to remain that way, barring a last-minute breakthrough in India's trade talks with the US leading to a proposal for a meeting with President Donald Trump . As things stand now, any such development seems unlikely.If he travels all the way to New York, the PM would ideally want to have a bilateral meeting with Trump. However, in the current circumstances, govt believes it's best to avoid a high-stakes meeting between the leaders. Jaishankar is certain to be there and will meet many of his counterparts on the margins, including Ukraine foreign minister Andrii Sybiha.Trump is also reportedly upset with Modi for not hopping over to Washington from Canada where the PM was attending the G7 summit. However, the fact that the President was hosting Pakistan army chief Asim Munir at the same time made it impossible for Modi to travel to the capital.",The ministry of external affairs did not confirm who will lead the delegation.

Diwali Gift for Consumers: Govt Slashes GST Across Sectors, Prices to Drop from Sept 22

Saurabh Agarwal is Partner, EY India and Parul Nagpal is Partner, EY India





As India gears up to celebrate Diwali, the India’s Union Government, led by a visionary Prime Minister, left no stone unturned to increase the savings for a common man through revolutionary reforms and rate rationalisation under GST. As expected, the removal of 12% and 28% slabs will pervasively benefit key business sectors including daily essentials, healthcare, consumer electronics, automobile, agriculture etc. The reforms, when given a closer look, are reflective of significant measures to boost some of the key drivers of the economy namely – Human Capital, Private Consumption, Business Investments and Government Expenditures.As GST 2.0 was dedicated to the common man, the focus on daily essentials was indeed a highlight. From exempting key products like ultra-high temperature (UHT) milk, breads, paneer etc. to bringing down the levy to a mere 5% GST rate on butter, packaged food products etc., the measures would only serve the objective of deepening the pockets of citizens for ensuring increased private spendings ahead of the festive season.The ""COMMON MAN ITEMS"" section in the Press Release highlighted the theme of rationalization, featuring household items like handbags, umbrellas, bicycles, now made subject to a concessional 5% GST.This reduction reflects a thoughtful approach rather than a forced change, as many of these goods were previously taxed at 18%, indicating a deliberate effort to ease the financial burden on consumers while maintaining certain existing tax slabs.It was also widely noted that pursuant to the announcement of GST 2.0, sectors like automobiles and consumer electronics saw a sales dip due to anticipated rate reductions. With clearer implementation timelines, these sectors are poised for revenue growth during the festive season. While luxury vehicles maintain high GST rates , the decision to limit three-wheeler GST reductions to 18% (instead of 5%) may invite re-consideration, as these vehicles serve the rural population expected to benefit from the reforms.Moving towards agriculture, the Government walked the talk which was being echoed since the fall of tariff negotiations with the US. The dedicated support for farmers was clear with the reduced GST to 5% on essential agricultural machinery and fertilizers. Simultaneously, as the pharmaceutical sector remained exempt from the US taxes, it was only fair to grant full exemptions for essential drugs and lower levies on medical devices under GST, showcasing an effort to enhance equity in domestic trade.While the services sector too went through significant changes, the critical highlight and talking point would remain the exemptions granted to the insurance industry. As part of the Union Budget 2025-26, it is noteworthy that the Government enhanced the FDI limits in the sector to 100% under automatic routes which opened the doors for increased competitiveness in the sector through foreign players. These measures, when analysed collectively, are likely to increase the affordability of insurance products in India.Shifting the focus from rate changes, it is equally critical to note the extended focus on Ease of Doing Business (EoDB) as the Government has taken noteworthy steps by way of simplifying GST registration processes, treatment of discounts which will play a critical role in the upcoming festive season. Additionally, the measures to sanction 90% accumulated ITC refunds on preliminary risk evaluation and removing levy in intermediary services has set a tone for strengthening the position of ‘Made-in-India’ goods/ services at global stage.It was indeed pleasing to see that the Government also took note of significant challenges caused to businesses owing to delayed implementation of the Appellate Tribunals despite notifying specific rules long back. Consequently, the industry would welcome the decision to operationalise Tribunals by end of September including the clarity offered for timelines for consideration of backlog appeals and hearing.On the revenue and policy front, the Government’s decision to impose higher GST rates of 40% on luxury and sin goods, such as tobacco, pan masala, aerated sugar drinks and luxury automobiles is understandable since the move discourages harmful consumption and offsets revenue losses caused by external tariff impacts, especially US trade barriers. The higher rate structure acts as an economic shock absorber consequently fortifying the domestic market against global tariff-induced uncertainty while curbing forex outflows associated with luxury imports.While the GST 2.0 effective from 22 September 2025 delivers significant relief to end consumers, it is indeed an uplifting measure of India’s GDP as well which needed a significant push considering the $30 Trillion economy dream to be achieved by 2047. It is likely that these measures would enhance Per Capita Income levels leading to increased spendings, a critical affair amidst global tariff wars. It is also noteworthy that reforms would also entail some short-term transitional challenges to businesses such as implementing anti-profiteering measures, navigating refund of accumulated credits etc. Therefore, to ensure smooth and litigation-free implementation of these reforms, the Government may need to work closely with industry bodies to achieve the defined objectives and issue appropriate clarifications, as required.","The removal of 12% and 28% slabs will pervasively benefit key business sectors including daily essentials, healthcare, consumer electronics, automobile, agriculture etc. The reforms are reflective of significant measures to boost some of the key drivers of the economy namely – Human Capital, Private Consumption, Business Investments and Government Expenditures.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123718220,imgsize-112344,width-400,resizemode-4/gst-rate-cuts.jpg"

Gmail Warning: That Urgent Security Notification from Google May Be a Trap

Eugene Ling , a former sales employee at Scale AI, has issued a public apology to his current team and employer, Mercor , after a report emerged that his ex-company is suing them. The lawsuit, filed two months after Scale AI secured a massive $14.3 billion investment from Mark Zuckerberg's Meta, accuses Ling of stealing confidential documents containing customer strategies and other proprietary information.“Just heard I’m getting sued by Scale. Last month, I left Scale to work at Mercor. I know this was frustrating for my old team, and I feel bad about that,” Ling said in a post.Ling also denies any “nefarious intent.” He stated that after leaving Scale, he asked his former employer if he could delete files from his personal drive, but was instructed not to.“When Scale reached out about some files I had in my personal drive, I asked if I could just delete them. But Scale asked that I not do anything with them, so I’m still waiting for guidance on how to resolve this. I’ve never used any of them in this role. It sounds like Scale wants to sue me and that’s up to them,” he said.“I’m really sorry to my new team at Mercor for having to deal with this,” he added.Ling’s post that came after a report by TechCrunch said that Scale AI’s lawsuit alleges that Ling ""stole more than 100 confidential documents concerning Scale’s customer strategies and other proprietary information"" and attempted to poach one of Scale’s largest clients for Mercor.Surya Midha, co-founder of Mercor, told the publication that Ling may have had possession of the documents but denied that his company had used any of the data.“We have no interest in any of Scale’s trade secrets and in fact are intentionally running our business in a different way,” Midha said. He also revealed that Mercor had reached out to Scale AI days before the lawsuit was filed, offering to have Ling destroy the files.Scale AI's lawsuit claims that the stolen documents contained data that would have allowed Mercor to serve several of its most important clients, including a major customer, referred to in the suit as ""Customer A."" Scale alleges that winning this client away would be “worth millions of dollars to Mercor.”The legal action comes just weeks after Meta's significant investment in Scale AI. Zuckerberg’s company now holds 49% of Scale AI and also hired its CEO Alexandr Wang as well as some other employees as part of the deal. Wang is now chief AI officer of Meta.","Eugene Ling, a former sales employee at Scale AI, has issued a public apology to his current team and employer, Mercor.

Larry Ellison’s billion-dollar real estate empire: From Japanese palaces to Hawaiian island mansions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/larry-ellisons-billion-dollar-real-estate-empire-from-japanese-palaces-to-hawaiian-island-mansions/articleshow/123712643.cms,"Image: Getty Images

Lanai: The crown jewel of Larry Ellison’s empire

Woodside estate: A Japanese-inspired masterpiece











Malibu’s Carbon Beach: Billionaire’s Row



Record-breaking Florida deals

Historic and international holdings





Larry Ellison, co-founder of Oracle and one of the richest men in the world, is almost as famous for his vast real estate empire as he is for building one of Silicon Valley’s most influential companies. According to Forbes, Ellison’s net worth surpasses $270 billion, and he has funneled more than $1 billion into acquiring homes, resorts, private islands, and historic estates across the globe. His portfolio spans from Hawaii’s remote island of Lanai to oceanfront Malibu mansions and palatial estates in California, Florida, and beyond. Each property is not just a luxury purchase but also a reflection of Ellison’s love for art, culture, and architecture, making his holdings some of the most unique among the billionaire class.In 2012, Ellison stunned the world by buying 98% of the Hawaiian island of Lanai for $300 million from Dole Food chairman David Murdock, as reported by Forbes. He didn’t stop there—Ellison has since invested close to half a billion dollars in the island, transforming it into both a luxury retreat and a hub for sustainability. His projects include the exclusive Sensei Retreat, which charges around $3,000 per night, Nobu Lanai restaurant, and sprawling hydroponic farms powered by renewable energy.Ellison often describes Lanai as a “laboratory for sustainability,” where experimental agriculture and wellness tourism coexist. With a private airport, pristine beaches, and luxury resorts operated by Four Seasons, Lanai has become the ultimate showcase of Ellison’s wealth and vision.Ellison’s 23-acre estate in Woodside, California, is widely considered his architectural crown jewel. Modeled after a 16th-century Japanese imperial palace, the estate cost over $200 million to design and construct, as reported by Fortune. It features an 8,000-square-foot main house, koi ponds, man-made lakes, and an authentic tea house—all designed to reflect Ellison’s fascination with Japanese culture. The home is surrounded by more than 1,000 cherry trees and maples, making it a living, seasonal work of art. The project reportedly took nearly a decade to complete and is so extensive that Ellison once joked it could be mistaken for a small village. For Ellison, this wasn’t just a residence but a personal tribute to Japanese architecture and aesthetics.Ellison is also the largest individual landowner on Malibu’s Carbon Beach, famously known as “Billionaire’s Beach.” According to The Wall Street Journal, Ellison owns at least 10 properties on this coveted stretch, valued collectively at more than $180 million. His holdings include sleek modernist mansions with private beach access and homes he rents to celebrities and high-profile figures. One of his most notable acquisitions was a $48 million estate in 2017, featuring a pool and tennis court. Carbon Beach, where homes regularly sell for over $20 million, has long been a playground for tech moguls, Hollywood stars, and financiers. Ellison’s dominance here reflects his strategy of concentrating ownership in ultra-exclusive neighborhoods, giving him unmatched privacy and prestige.Ellison has also turned his attention to Florida’s luxury coastline. In 2022, he shattered records with his purchase of a $173 million estate in Manalapan, the most expensive home ever sold in the state at the time, according to Forbes. Not stopping there, Ellison also acquired the Eau Palm Beach Resort & Spa for $277 million, cementing his presence in South Florida’s hospitality market. His total Manalapan investments exceed $450 million. Earlier, in 2021, Ellison purchased an $80 million North Palm Beach mansion, giving him one of the largest oceanfront properties in Palm Beach County. These acquisitions underscore his interest not only in trophy homes but also in entire resorts that generate long-term value and influence.Ellison’s taste for grandeur extends to historic estates and international properties. In Newport, Rhode Island, he owns the Beechwood Mansion, once home to the Astor family, which he bought for $10.5 million. According to Fortune, Ellison has spent more than $100 million restoring Beechwood to serve as a private art museum for his collection. He also owns the Cal Neva Lodge at Lake Tahoe, once co-owned by Frank Sinatra, and has holdings in San Francisco and Aspen. Internationally, Ellison has purchased properties in Japan, a country that has deeply influenced his architectural choices. His investments abroad further reflect his blend of cultural appreciation and ambition to create lasting landmarks.Ellison’s real estate strategy goes beyond luxury—it’s about vision. He often treats his properties as experimental grounds. On Lanai, he tests sustainable food production and eco-tourism. In Woodside, he celebrates Japanese culture. With Beechwood, he turns a historic estate into a private art museum. His Malibu holdings consolidate his position in one of the world’s most prestigious beaches. Unlike many billionaires who simply collect trophy properties, Ellison’s empire reflects his belief that real estate can combine art, culture, technology, and sustainability. For him, every home is not just a residence but a statement.","Larry Ellison is the co-founder of Oracle and one of the richest men in the world.

Elon Musk: Tesla’s $1 trillion package for Elon Musk could make him the world’s first trillionaire,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/teslas-1-trillion-package-for-elon-musk-could-make-him-the-worlds-first-trillionaire/articleshow/123731417.cms,"Elon Musk’s record-breaking pay plan



Targets and milestones

Raising Tesla’s market capitalization from roughly $1.1 trillion to at least $8.5 trillion.

Delivering one million autonomous “robotaxis” into commercial operation.

Deploying one million humanoid robots.

Increasing Tesla’s annual profits from $17 billion to $400 billion.

Achieving 20 million vehicle deliveries per year.

Approval & legal considerations







Elon Musk could potentially become the world’s first trillionaire under a newly proposed Tesla pay plan, which ties his compensation entirely to ambitious long-term performance milestones. The package, if fully realized, could be worth up to $1 trillion over the next decade, contingent on Tesla achieving unprecedented targets in market capitalization, vehicle deliveries, and robotics deployment. The plan relies exclusively on Tesla stock and requires Musk to remain at the company for up to 10 years to receive the full payout. Analysts describe it as the largest executive compensation in history, combining immense reward with extraordinary risk.The proposed compensation package could award Musk nearly 12% of Tesla’s total stock, approximately 423.7 million additional shares, if he meets the set targets. All compensation would be delivered in Tesla shares, with partial vesting requiring 7.5 years of continued leadership and full vesting requiring a full 10-year commitment. The ambitious nature of the plan underscores Tesla’s confidence in Musk’s leadership and its vision for exponential growth.Tesla has outlined unprecedented targets for Musk to achieve, including:These goals are widely regarded as extraordinary and challenging, pushing the boundaries of current automotive, AI, and robotics technologies.The Tesla pay plan must be approved by shareholders in a vote scheduled for November 6, 2025. Experts note that the proposal mirrors Musk’s 2018 pay plan, which faced legal hurdles, but Tesla’s relocation to Texas may help it withstand scrutiny this time. If approved, the plan could roughly double Musk’s existing Tesla stake to nearly 29%, consolidating his influence over the company’s strategic direction.Financial experts emphasizes both the extraordinary opportunity and the extreme difficulty of Musk achieving trillionaire status under this plan. Observers praise the plan as a strategic tool to secure Musk’s long-term focus at Tesla while also expressing concern over massive shareholder dilution and the feasibility of reaching such ambitious targets. If successful, the package would not only make Musk the first trillionaire in history but also fundamentally reshape executive compensation expectations in global business.","Elon Musk could potentially become the world’s first trillionaire under a newly proposed Tesla pay plan.

One even claimed to belong to a joint secretary, government of India. Officials also seized a laptop, forged Aadhaar and driving licences, beacon lights, debit cards, and visiting cards carrying high-level designations. A bag with 25 forged documents and fake passes further revealed the scale of his operations.Tripathi’s social media profiles were carefully curated to build credibility. He flaunted pictures with the governor of Assam and the Goa CM, creating the perfect aura of authority. “He cleverly exploited VIP protocols to appear genuine,” investigators said. Police are still probing whether these pictures are real or morphed.The fraud unraveled when a Lucknow businessman, after reaching out to Tripathi for official work, grew suspicious and informed a senior IAS officer.The Local Intelligence Unit (LIU) began discreet checks, leading to his arrest. DCP Crime Kamlesh Tripathi said a multi-agency probe was underway. “His emails and accounts are under cyber analysis. We’re tracking bank transactions and property trails to identify victims across states,” he said. At least half a dozen people have already come forward, alleging they were duped with promises of official favours.Even as he lived the life of a ‘fake IAS,’ Tripathi was employed as a Project Manager at ABM Knowledgeware Ltd., working on the Double Entry Accounting System project at the UP Directorate of Local Bodies.This seems to be his real identity, asper police. However, another FIR was lodged at Sushant Golf City police station for misrepresenting himself as special secretary, Urban Development Department, in social media posts.Police said his wife, a BTech graduate employed in a private firm, appeared unaware of his double life. The couple, along with their two children, lived in Lucknow, shielded by the illusion of respectability he had built. As investigations spread across multiple states, police are now piecing together how one man turned impersonation into a career, living high on deception until the mask slipped.","Saurabh Tripathi projected himself as cabinet secretary on LinkedIn and X.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.
