Watch: Guwahati submerged as heavy rain causes severe waterlogging,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/watch-guwahati-submerged-as-heavy-rain-causes-severe-waterlogging/articleshow/121544987.cms,"NEW DELHI: Incessant and heavy rainfall over the past 24 hours led to severe waterlogging in multiple parts of Guwahati on Saturday, prompting rescue efforts by the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF), Civil Defence, and local authorities. Visuals from across the city — including Beltola Survey, Juripar, and Rukminigaon — showed submerged roads and residents wading through waist-deep water.“Water started surging and entered our rooms at around 8 pm… There was no provision to cook food either as the kitchen was also inundated,” said Hemanta Kalita, a resident of Bonda, which also witnessed a fatal landslide.Several areas in Sribhumi and central Guwahati bore the brunt of urban flooding as heavy downpours battered the region. Schools, government offices, and businesses were shut in the state capital due to the deluge.Authorities suspect the rainfall was intensified by a depression over northern Bangladesh and adjoining Meghalaya. The India Meteorological Department confirmed Guwahati recorded its highest-ever May rainfall with 111 mm in the past 24 hours.At least 32 people have died across five northeastern states in related flood and landslide incidents.

"UPI ransom payment leads to kidnappers' arrest, trader's rescue",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/upi-ransom-payment-leads-to-kidnappers-arrest-traders-rescue/articleshow/121544495.cms,"Representative image

KOLKATA: In what otherwise seemed like a perfect kidnapping of a trader for ransom, the panic-stricken wife's unwitting transfer of part of the money via UPI to one of the kidnappers proved to be their Achilles' heel, landing them behind bars in Kolkata on Saturday.Five kidnappers had abducted Timir Kanti Majumder, a trader from South 24 Parganas district's Kulpi, Wednesday from near Netaji Bhavan Metro station in Kolkata, where he had gone for some bank work. They kept him captive in an 11th-floor flat of a condominium on SC Mullick Road, near Jadavpur's Sulekha area.The accused used Majumder's phone to contact his wife via WhatsApp call, demanding a ransom of Rs 10 lakh, which was later negotiated down to Rs 5 lakh. Panicked upon receiving the ransom calls, the victim's wife told the kidnappers she needed time to arrange the money. As a token amount, she sent Rs 10,000 via UPI to one of the accused, Suman Bose, police said.The UPI transaction gave police a breakthrough, leading to the arrest of all five accused within four hours of the rescue operation. ""We located Bose near Sukanta Setu. He was nabbed and questioned extensively before he led us to the flat inside the Jadavpur condo.He also helped us locate the victim,"" said an investigating officer.""The main hurdle in the investigation was locating any suspect, as neither the complainant, Majumder's wife Tapasi, nor her family could provide any leads. The suspects weren't using their own mobile phones,"" said DC Priyabrata Roy. The accused had kept their phones switched off and used the victim's device to place ransom calls over a WiFi network.Police have booked accused Sajal Bose (43), Sudip Mazumder (39), Suman Bose (51), Samir Kumar Deb (51), and Sandipan alias Chima Das (39), for kidnapping for ransom, said Joint CP (Crime) Rupesh Kumar.""It seems a dispute over financial transactions led to the trader's kidnapping. The accused claimed the victim owed them lakhs of rupees. However, the complainant denies this, saying Majumder was tricked in a business venture. What is clear is that the accused and the victim knew each other,"" said another officer.","Timir Kanti Majumder, a trader from South 24 Parganas district's Kulpi, was abducted Wednesday.

New ITR Forms FY 2024-25

New ITR Filing Deadline FY 2024-25: In a major relief to taxpayers, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has extended the deadline for filing Income Tax Returns (ITRs) for the assessment year 2025–26. Returns originally due by July 31, 2025, can now be filed until September 15, 2025.The extension comes amid significant revisions in ITR forms, ongoing system development, and the need for accurate reflection of TDS credits.""CBDT has decided to extend the due date of filing of ITRs, which are due for filing by 31st July 2025, to 15th September 2025 This extension will provide more time due to significant revisions in ITR forms, system development needs, and TDS credit reflections. This ensures a smoother and more accurate filing experience for everyone. Formal notification will follow."" Income Tax Department, Government of India posted on X.According to CBDT, the notified ITRS for AY 2025-26 have undergone structural and content revisions aimed at simplifying compliance, enhancing transparency, and enabling accurate reporting. These changes have necessitated additional time for system development, integration, and testing of the corresponding utilities.Furthermore, credits arising from TDS statements, due for filing by 31st May 2025, are expected to begin reflecting in early June, limiting the effective window for return filing in the absence of such extension.""In view of the extensive changes introduced in the notified ITRs and considering the time required for system readiness and rollout of Income Tax Return (ITR) utilities for Assessment Year (AY) 2025-26, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has decided to extend the due date for filing returns. Accordingly, to facilitate a smooth and convenient filing experience for taxpayers, it has been decided that the due date for filing of ITRS, originally due on 31st July 2025, is extended to 15th September 2025. "" CBDT release stated.A formal notification reflecting the new deadline will be issued separately, said V. Rajitha, Commissioner of Income Tax (Media & Technical Policy) and Official Spokesperson for CBDT.""This extension is expected to mitigate the concerns raised by stakeholders and provide adequate time for compliance, thereby ensuring the integrity and accuracy of the return filing process."" CBDT added.Parizad Sirwalla, Partner and Head, Global Mobility Services, Tax, KPMG in India tells TOI, “Changes in the tax law in the past year and additional disclosure as well as other updates to the tax return form for Financial Year (FY) 2024-25 have necessitated additional time for updating the technology for the tax department. This will entail revising the tax filing utility on the income tax portal as well. Hence, extending the deadline to file the income tax returns for FY 24-25 by almost one and a half months from 31 July 2025 to 15 September 2025 is in line with the expectations. This extension aims to enhance the taxpayer experience by providing requisite time to file returns once the TDS credits are appropriately reflecting in taxpayers Form 26AS and AIS/ TIS following the submission of TDS statements by employers/ deductors of TDS due by May 31, 2025.“Nonetheless, it is in the taxpayers' best interest to file their returns as soon as the filing utility is made available to avoid additional interest costs where tax payments are due or to allow department time to process the returns at the earliest where refunds are due,” she adds.Sonu Iyer, Partner and National Leader, People Advisory Services-Tax, EY India explains, “The ITR forms notified for the FY 2024-25 (AY 2025-26) incorporate the amendments introduced by the Finance Act 2024 and have enhanced reporting requirements relating to deductions being claimed, requirement to report TDS section codes, provide the bifurcation of capital gains for pre and post 23 July 2024, etc. If you recall, Finance Act 2024 has rationalized capital gains taxation on specific transactions on or after 23 July 2024. ”“Given the requirements of these new ITR forms, the e-filing utility (both online and offline) needs to be updated by the Government. Therefore, it is a very welcome move from the government to extend the ITR filing deadline from 31 July 2025 to 15 Sep 2025, allowing taxpayers the time required to comply with these enhanced reporting requirements and legislative changes,” she adds.As per CA Ashish Niraj, Partner at A S N & Company, Chartered Accountants: “This extension was very much awaited by Income Tax professionals and taxpayers, as the Income Tax portal had not yet enabled the filing of ITRs on its portal till May 27, 2025. Normally, July 31 is due date for the category of taxpayers whose accounts are not required to be audited. As the due date was approaching, professionals and taxpayers were tense about how they would prepare and file returns in such a short span of time once the portal allowed ITR filing. There were issues in fetching proper AIS data and TDS data in some cases. All these are required to be reconciled to file error-free returns. Even AIS is not getting fetched properly in many cases. Now that the ITR due date has been extended, taxpayers will get enough time to prepare returns, compare with AIS, 26AS, etc., to avoid mismatches and file them accurately. It’s really a welcome decision.”Meanwhile, the Income Tax Department has notified all seven ITR forms for AY 2025–26, incorporating structural updates and simplifications. ITR-1 (Sahaj) is meant for resident individuals with income up to Rs 50 lakh from salary, one house property, other sources (like interest), and agricultural income up to Rs 5,000. A key update now allows salaried individuals to report long-term capital gains (LTCG) up to Rs 1.25 lakh under ITR-1, which was earlier not permitted.ITR-2 applies to individuals and Hindu Undivided Families (HUFs) who do not have income from business or profession but have income from capital gains. A new requirement mandates reporting capital gains separately based on whether they arose before or after July 23, 2024, due to changes in LTCG tax treatment introduced in the 2024 Union Budget.ITR-3 is for individuals and HUFs with income from business or profession. It now features an increased reporting threshold under Schedule AL (Assets and Liabilities)—from Rs 50 lakh to Rs 1 crore—reducing compliance for middle-income taxpayers.ITR-4 (Sugam) is designed for individuals, HUFs, and firms (excluding LLPs) with total income up to Rs 50 lakh who opt for presumptive taxation under sections 44AD, 44ADA, or 44AE. It too now permits reporting of LTCG up to Rs 1.25 lakh, providing relief to small taxpayers with limited capital gains.ITR-5 is meant for firms, LLPs, AOPs, BOIs, and co-operative societies, while ITR-6 is applicable to companies, excluding those claiming exemption under section 11. Both these forms include changes in the capital gains schedule in line with the revised tax rules post-July 2024.Lastly, ITR-7 is for trusts and charitable institutions required to file returns under sections 139(4A), 139(4B), 139(4C), and 139(4D).","The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has extended the deadline for filing Income Tax Returns (ITRs) for the assessment year 2025–26. Returns originally due by July 31, 2025, can now be filed until September 15, 2025. This extension will provide more time due to significant revisions in ITR forms, system development needs, and TDS credit reflections.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121438242,imgsize-1565741,width-400,resizemode-4/121438242.jpg"

NEW DELHI: India's active Covid-19 cases have crossed the 3,000 threshold, with Kerala reporting the highest number of infections, according to data released by the Union health ministry on Saturday. The number of active cases has risen sharply from 257 on May 22 to 3,395 as of May 31. In the last 24 hours alone, 685 new cases were recorded, and four deaths were reported, one each in Delhi, Kerala, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh.Health officials maintain there is no reason for alarm. “The severity of infections is low, with most patients under home care,” an official source told news agency PTI.Dr Rajiv Behl, Director General of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said on Monday that genome sequencing from affected regions in the west and south of India confirmed that the variants driving the latest increase are all Omicron subvariants — LF.7, XFG, JN.1, and NB.1.8.1. “We should monitor and be vigilant, but there is no cause to worry,” he said.The rise in active cases is most pronounced in Kerala (1,336), followed by Maharashtra (467), Delhi (375), Gujarat (265), Karnataka (234), West Bengal (205), Tamil Nadu (185) and Uttar Pradesh (117).Delhi reported the death of a 60-year-old woman who had acute intestinal obstruction, while Karnataka reported a 63-year-old cancer patient who had co-morbidities including tuberculosis.Odisha health secretary Aswathy S urged residents not to panic, assuring that all seven patients in the state are stable and the situation remains under control. “The latest ICMR report says that the present variant does not exhibit severe symptoms, and most cases are mild,” she said.Delhi chief minister Rekha Gupta has reiterated that the city’s hospitals are well-prepared. “Nineteen patients are hospitalised in Delhi, but there is no need to worry. The government is alert,” she said. An earlier advisory instructed hospitals to ensure the availability of beds, oxygen, antibiotics, and vaccines.As active cases continue to rise in Karnataka, the state’s health and family welfare department has issued a detailed advisory aimed at preventing further spread.Healthcare workers have been directed to report all Influenza-Like Illness (ILI) and Severe Acute Respiratory Infections (SARI) cases, especially those with co-morbidities. A portion of these cases will undergo RT-PCR testing, and symptomatic individuals among vulnerable groups — including children, the elderly, and pregnant women, must be tested.The advisory also mandates the tracking of positivity rates and CT values, genome sequencing of severe cases, and sewage surveillance where applicable.With schools set to reopen in June, a separate circular instructed schools to send symptomatic children home and ensure that teachers and staff do not work while ill. “Avoid crowded or poorly ventilated areas, especially for immunocompromised individuals,” the circular said.","India's active Covid-19 cases have crossed the 3,000 threshold.

(With inputs from agencies)

India is actively engaging with manufacturers from the UK, France, and Japan to co-develop fighter jet engines, broadening its defense ties beyond the US as it faces mounting security challenges and looks to shore up its indigenous aerospace capabilities, a Bloomberg report said. Senior officials told Bloomberg that the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) will evaluate these proposals, with the aim to start the project swiftly.The countries in talks-UK’s Rolls-Royce, France’s Safran, and an undisclosed Japanese partner-are all offering technology transfers and potential co-production arrangements, according to people familiar with the matter. Rolls-Royce offered to jointly produce and transfer technology to India during a visit by senior defense ministry officials to the UK in April, while Safran is reportedly open to sharing intellectual property rights, the Bloomberg report said.India’s push to diversify its fighter jet engine partnerships signals a strategic rebalancing in its defense policy. For decades, India’s defense ties leaned heavily on Russian suppliers, with growing partnerships with the US in the past decade. However, India’s decision to explore new partners highlights a shift: an urgent focus on reliability, supply chain security, and technological self-sufficiency amid global uncertainties.Air Chief Marshal A P Singh warned at an industry event on Thursday that delays in acquiring critical weapons “pose a serious challenge to national defense readiness,” adding bluntly, “Not for a single project that I can think of that has been completed on time.” His remarks underscore why India is moving beyond a single-source approach, especially after penalties were imposed on General Electric for delivery delays on engines that power India’s locally-made Tejas light combat jets.India’s military modernization push has been a long time coming, with delays plaguing every step of the way. Singh’s remarks-“once a timeline is given… not a single project that I can think of has been completed on time”-reflect growing impatience within India’s defense establishment.State-owned Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL) has faced flak for delays in delivering Tejas Mark-1A jets, forcing the government to pivot to private sector involvement to speed things up. The new execution model for the Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA) is a radical shift, designed to harness private innovation and global expertise while ending HAL’s monopoly on fighter production.India’s ambition is to power its twin-engine fifth-generation fighter jets-currently under the AMCA project-with engines co-developed or built domestically in collaboration with global partners. The AMCA program is part of India’s larger vision to modernize its aging, largely Russian-made air force fleet and reduce dependence on foreign suppliers.Defense minister Rajnath Singh has approved a new “execution model” for the AMCA, which for the first time allows private sector firms to bid for the project alongside the HAL. Officials say the Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA), which is leading the project, will soon issue an expression of interest to domestic and international players.The project’s significance is clear: China’s rapidly advancing J-20 and rumored sixth-generation jets have raised alarm bells in Delhi. Meanwhile, Pakistan is set to acquire at least 40 Chinese J-35A fifth-generation fighters. With only 30 active fighter squadrons against an authorized strength of 42, India needs to catch up-and quickly.Michael Rubin, a South Asia analyst at the American Enterprise Institute, described India’s drive as part of a “broader effort to secure the supply chain for critical defense equipment.” He noted that the “military lesson from Ukraine’s war has been clear: self-sufficiency and reliable partnerships are paramount.”Meanwhile, Air Chief Marshal A P Singh emphasized in his CII Business Summit remarks, “We need to quickly get our act together… while design in India continues to produce results in the near future or maybe later, what is required today is required today.”India’s defense collaborations are moving from traditional vendor relationships to true joint development. Rolls-Royce, for example, offered to share cutting-edge engine technology, while Safran has expressed willingness to co-create intellectual property within India-key for India’s ambitions to be more than just an assembly hub.Japan, too, has signaled openness to deeper defense industrial ties, aligning with India’s vision of a broader Indo-Pacific security network. Defence minister Rajnath Singh held talks in May with his Japanese counterpart, exploring potential collaborations in tank and aero engine development.These moves do not indicate a cooling of India-US ties-joint manufacturing of GE’s F414 engines is still a cornerstone of Indo-US defense cooperation. But delays in that deal have prompted India to cast a wider net, underscoring that while Washington remains a top partner, India wants alternatives to hedge against risks.Indeed, India’s engagement with the UK, France, and Japan is about more than just hardware-it’s about building strategic resilience in the defense sector. A senior official involved in the negotiations said the goal is not to sideline US defense ties but “to ensure we have multiple options, as this is about national security.”India aims to finalise the AMCA’s prototype phase by developing five aircraft before moving to series production.For the first two AMCA squadrons, India will rely on the US-made GE F414 engines. But for the remaining five squadrons-over 100 jets-it wants more powerful 110-kilonewton engines built with technology partners outside the US, according to the officials.India’s broader defense transformation, its AMCA program, and its engagement with multiple global players highlight a fundamental truth: for New Delhi, defense self-reliance and resilient supply chains are no longer optional-they are non-negotiable in a rapidly changing world.","India is actively engaging with manufacturers from the UK, France, and Japan to co-develop fighter jet engines.

"New apprenticeship policy to link degrees, raise stipends",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/new-apprenticeship-policy-to-link-degrees-raise-stipends/articleshow/121544411.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Centre has proposed comprehensive reforms to revitalise the apprenticeship ecosystem. Key measures include an inflation-linked hike in stipend rates, from the current Rs 5,000-9,000 to Rs 6,800-12,300, to reduce dropout rates and attract diverse talent.The reforms also formalise Apprenticeship Embedded Degree Programmes (AEDP), enabling apprentices to earn recognised degrees alongside practical training. Additionally, the policy aims to enable global deployment of apprentices at overseas client sites and expand training delivery through digital and virtual platforms.These proposals come amid persistent structural challenges within the apprenticeship framework. An official from ministry of skill development and entrepreneurship (MSDE) said, ""The proposed stipend increase is essential to curb dropouts and make apprenticeships viable, especially in sectors like technology, manufacturing, and services where living and commuting costs can be prohibitive.""A 2022 parliamentary standing committee report recommended convergence through a unified operational and digital infrastructure.Industry participation, particularly among small and medium enterprises (SMEs), remains limited due to administrative complexity, compliance burdens, and lack of awareness. Regional disparities persist, with only 1.2% of apprentices from the North-East despite targeted benefits. Female participation, while improving, continues to lag behind overall workforce levels.Fragmentation between ministry of education and MSDE - which run National Apprenticeship Training Scheme (NATS) and Pradhan Mantri National Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme (PM-NAPS), respectively - has caused duplication and inefficiencies. ""We are developing a unified apprenticeship portal to integrate certification, data sharing, and employer outreach. This will simplify processes, reduce compliance friction, and improve access for both apprentices and employers,"" the official added.The 38th meeting of Central Apprenticeship Council, chaired by Jayant Chaudhary, minister of state (independent charge), MSDE, recently discussed these proposals and charted a forward-looking policy roadmap. The reforms include targeted inclusion measures for women, persons with disabilities (PwDs), and youth from the northeastern region (NER). The official noted: ""Expanding participation from under-represented groups, particularly from the North-East and PwDs, is a key priority. The pilot project launched in Mizoram, providing an additional Rs 1,500 monthly stipend to over 26,000 apprentices, highlights our commitment.""Formal regulation of AEDPs will allow apprentices to earn recognised degrees alongside hands-on training, strengthening the link between education and industry needs. ""Only 0.27% of India's workforce are apprentices, compared to 3% in the UK and Germany. Attrition rates remain high. Inflation-linked stipends and degree-linked apprenticeships will help reduce attrition and sustain a steady talent supply,"" said Nipun Sharma, CEO, degree apprenticeship, Team Lease. He also pointed out the low female participation, despite sectors like electronics manufacturing and smartphone assembly preferring female workers.On global deployment plan, the official said, ""Allowing apprentices to gain experience at overseas client sites will expose them to international standards and prepare them for a competitive global workforce.""","Centre has proposed comprehensive reforms to revitalise the apprenticeship ecosystem.

Spent 15% of time nixing fake news during Op Sindoor: CDS Anil Chauhan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/spent-15-of-time-nixing-fake-news-during-op-sindoor-cds/articleshow/121544057.cms,"File photo: CDS Anil Chauhan

NEW DELHI: Almost 15% of the operational time during Operation Sindoor was spent countering fake narratives and disinformation, CDS Gen Anil Chauhan said Saturday, describing the four-day hostilities with Pakistan as a ""non-contact and multi-domain"" conflict involving both kinetic and non-kinetic elements that ""exemplifies the future of war"".""During the crisis, India retained full operational clarity and autonomy, regardless of broader geopolitical currents,"" the CDS said during the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore as well as in interviews on its sidelines.India did not detect ""any unusual activity"" on the ""operational or tactical depth"" along the 3,488km Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China during this time, although Islamabad is closely allied with Beijing, he added.Moreover, while Pakistan may have leveraged Chinese commercial satellite imagery, the CDS said there is ""no proof of real-time targeting support"" provided by Beijing during Operation Sindoor.This came in the backdrop of there being no signs of de-escalation and de-induction of troops between the Indian and Chinese armies along the LAC as yet after disengagement at the two remaining face-off sites at Depsang and Demchok in eastern Ladakh last Oct.Noting that almost 80% of the equipment procured by Pakistan over the last few years has been from China, the CDS said some kind of support and maintenance from OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) would certainly have been provided during the conflict.""India, by contrast, relied on indigenous systems like Akash, achieving success through effective system networking, integrating both domestic and foreign radars into a cohesive defence structure,"" Gen Chauhan said.Politically, the CDS said, India has drawn a new redline against terrorism and proxy war emanating from Pakistan, and ""hopefully our adversary will learn lessons"" from Operation Sindoor.While cross-border hostilities have ceased with effect from 5 pm on May 10, the Indian government had made it clear it would respond ""precisely and decisively"" should there be any further terror attacks with a Pakistani imprint. ""So that has its own dynamics as far as the armed forces are concerned. It will require us to be prepared 24/7,"" he said.On the massive disinformation campaign, the CDS underlined the need for a dedicated information warfare vertical. India's strategy laid stress on fact-based communication, even at the cost of slower responses. Initially, two women officers served as spokespersons, while the senior military leadership was engaged in operations. Only after May 10, Army, IAF and Navy DGMOs briefed the media, he said.Gen Chauhan also said that cyber operations played a limited role during the conflict. While there were some denial-of-service attacks, India's air-gapped military systems remained secure. While public platforms faced minor disruptions, operational systems were unaffected, he said.","India did not detect ""any unusual activity"" on the 3,488km Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China during this time.

Pakistan violated Indus Water Treaty through terror: India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pakistan-violated-indus-water-treaty-through-terror-india/articleshow/121543028.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Pakistan violated the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) through ""unrelenting cross-border terrorism"", India said at an international forum in Tajikistan and justified its action of putting the 1960 treaty in abeyance following the Pahalgam terrorist attack.The remarks, articulated by junior environment and external affairs minister Kirti Vardhan Singh at the Glaciers' Preservation conference in Dushanbe, came on Friday after Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif, at the UN-led global forum, accused India of weaponising water.Strongly condemning Pakistan's attempt to misuse the forum by raising IWT issues, Singh said the treaty's preamble stated that it was concluded in the spirit of goodwill and friendship, and that honouring the treaty in good faith was essential, but the cross-border terrorism from Pakistan interfered with its implementation.""We are appalled at the attempt by Pakistan to misuse the forum and to bring in unwarranted references to issues which do not fall within the purview of the forum. We strongly condemned such an attempt,"" said Singh, addressing the plenary session of the conference.The minister said it was an undeniable fact that there had been fundamental changes in circumstances - technological advancements, demographic changes, climate change and the ongoing threat of cross-border terrorism - since the treaty was signed, which now required a reassessment of its obligations.His remark is in sync with a clear understanding within government quarters about the need to revise the terms of the treaty, which has long been considered loaded against the interests of India.""Pakistan, which itself is in violation of the treaty, should desist from putting the blame of the breach of the treaty on India,"" said Singh.Sharif on Friday said his country would not allow India to cross the red line by holding IWT in abeyance, accusing it of endangering millions.Referring to the theme of the conference, Singh also gave details of what signified the change in circumstances as far as the impact of climate change was concerned and emphasised that the retreat of glaciers represented not only a warning but an immediate reality with far-reaching implications for water security, biodiversity and the livelihoods of billions of people. The minister underscored that the phenomenon was accelerating, with disproportionate impacts on mountain regions such as the Himalayas.","Pakistan violated Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) through ""unrelenting cross-border terrorism,"" India says.

Valmik Thapar was tiger's most tireless advocate

JAIPUR: Valmik Thapar was 24 - fresh out of St Stephen's with a gold medal in sociology and an old boy from The Doon School. He stood at a crossroads. Life had questions, but no answers. Then the jungle found him. In Ranthambhore, 1976, he met Fateh Singh Rathore - the national park's legendary field director.""Once you've looked into the eyes of a wild tiger,"" Thapar would later write, ""you're never the same."" That encounter didn't just chart a career spanning 50 years, it ignited a cause that would redefine tiger conservation in India.On Saturday morning, a pall of silence fell across Ranthambhore's forests. Thapar, 73, died at his Delhi home after a prolonged battle with cancer. More than just a conservationist, Thapar was a man who walked with tigers - and also an author, documentarian, policy adviser and activist.But to many, Valmik Thapar was the tiger's most tireless advocate. His relationship with Rathore, bloomed into a decades-long partnership that not only saved Ranthambhore's tigers from vanishing but also seeded a national movement for big cat protection.""I met Valmik as a 10-year-old in 1976,"" said Goverdhan Singh Rathore, son of Fateh Singh. ""He was going through a difficult time and came to Ranthambhore seeking peace.""""That meeting with my father led to a friendship that lasted a lifetime. Both led a long-running crusade to save Ranthambhore and its tigers,"" he added.In 1987, Thapar founded Ranthambhore Foundation - one of the first efforts in India to integrate conservation with community uplift. Villages ringing the park became part of the mission.Healthcare, education, women's employment and traditional crafts were woven into a model that linked forest protection to human well-being. NGOs like Dastkar joined the effort, showing conservation didn't need to be a choice between people and animals.Dharmendra Khandal, a close associate and conservation biologist, recalled time in the field with reverence. ""With Valmik sir, it was not just a safari; it was a masterclass in the wild. His energy at 70 was unmatched. Even between safaris, he wouldn't rest - he would invite me home for long, intense conversations about Ranthambhore's future.""Thapar authored nearly 50 books, narrated documentaries including Land of the Tiger for BBC, and served on over 150 committees, including National Board for Wildlife.He was unafraid to call out missteps in govt policy, yet managed to win trust across political and bureaucratic divides. ""He was fearless. Today, he has laid down his armour and gone to eternal rest,"" said Balendu Singh, former honorary warden of Ranthambhore.To those who worked with him, Thapar was a visionary mentor - sharp, driven, and unyielding. ""His booming voice will echo through the valleys of Ranthambhore forever,"" said Goverdhan Singh.Even in his final days, Thapar was deep into writing a two-volume chronicle marking 50 years of Ranthambhore.Wildlife filmmaker Subbiah Nallamuthu, who chronicled India's tigers for global audiences, perhaps captured Thapar's impact best. ""He was the voice through which India's tigers first spoke to the world. Long before streaming platforms and social media, he gave the tiger a language that was poetic, political and proudly Indian. The tiger may have lost a voice, but for those who read his words, watched his films, and walked the trails he once did, that voice still echoes. ""Thapar leaves behind his wife Sanjana Kapoor, daughter of actor Shashi Kapoor, and a life spent tracking pawprints through history.","Valmik Thapar, 73, died at his Delhi home after a prolonged battle with cancer.

'Kamalesan's behaviour was against secular norms of Army'

NEW DELHI: Delhi high court has upheld the 2017 termination of an Army officer who refused to participate in regimental weekly religious parades on the grounds that he belonged to the Christian faith.Samuel Kamalesan had challenged his dismissal without pension and gratuity, and sought reinstatement in service. In a May 30 order, a division bench of Justice Navin Chawla and Justice Shalinder Kaur said: ""Our armed forces comprise personnel of all religions, castes, creeds, regions and faiths, whose sole motto is to safeguard the country from external aggressions... They are united by their uniform rather than divided by their religion, caste or region. ""Kamalesan was commissioned in Army in March 2017 as a lieutenant in the 3rd Cavalry Regiment, which comprises three squadrons of Sikh, Jat and Rajput personnel. He was made the troop leader of Squadron B, which comprises Sikh personnel.In his plea, Kamalesan stated that his regiment maintained only a mandir and a gurdwara for its religious needs and parades, and not a sarv dharm sthal, which would serve persons of all faiths.He noted that there was no church on the premises.The bench observed that while regiments in the armed forces may historically bear names associated with religion or region, it does not undermine the secular ethos of the institution or of personnel posted in these regiments.""There are also war cries which, to an outsider, may sound religious in nature; however, they serve a purely motivational function, intended to foster solidarity and unity among the troops. At the same time, the armed forces also give due respect to the religious beliefs of their personnel,"" the bench noted.HC observed that Kamalesan kept his religion above a lawful command from his superior, which was clearly an act of indiscipline. ""While, to a civilian, it may appear harsh and even sound far-fetched, the standard of discipline required for the armed forces is different,"" it said.The bench stated the termination order specifically noted that Kamalesan's undisciplined behaviour was against all secular norms of Indian Army and adversely affected the traditional camaraderie between officers and troops of the regiment.Noting that Army organised several counselling sessions for Kamalesan, the court concluded that the decision of termination was taken after careful consideration of the specific circumstances of the case and potential consequences of different courses of action.","Delhi high court has upheld the 2017 termination of an Army officer who refused to participate in regimental religious parades.

Poll Do you believe the couple deserved a refund for their unused train tickets? Yes, they should be refunded No, it was their choice

BENGALURU: A senior citizen couple from Hoodi in Whitefield took on the railways and won after being denied refund for a train journey they never made, as their reserved coach was overcrowded and inaccessible, forcing them to return home. Bengaluru Urban II additional district consumer commission has pulled up South Western Railway (SWR) for deficiency in service and ordered a full refund along with litigation costs.The case, earlier dismissed by the forum on July 1, 2023, was challenged again by the couple at the state commission. The appeal was allowed, with the state commission setting aside the earlier order and directing the forum to readmit the complaint.The story began when Purna Ramakrishna and his wife Hymavathi booked sleeper class tickets on Guwahati Express for March 29, 2022, from Krishnarajapuram (KJM) Railway Station to Vijayawada on April 13, paying Rs 892.5 for the trip. On the day of the journey, after reaching the station by auto (spending Rs 165), the couple was shocked to find their S2 coach - and the entire train - packed with passengers, making it impossible for them to board.With no railway staff around to assist, they were forced to abandon the journey and return home.Despite several representations and email follow-ups, the railways neither refunded the ticket fare nor offered any explanation or compensation. Left with no option, the elderly couple filed a consumer complaint citing service lapses.In their complaint, they said they informed the railways post-departure and expected a ticket deposit receipt (TDR) to be raised. But no TDR was filed and no refund or compensation issued.However, the railways, in its defence, denied any service deficiency, claiming that the train was not overcrowded when it arrived at the station. In their written response, railway officials acknowledged their tickets, further stating the train was fully reserved and unreserved travel was restored across the division after Covid. Therefore, they argued, the couple's claims of overcrowding by unauthorised passengers were ""false and baseless"".The railways said 134 passengers boarded from KJM on April 13 with no overcrowding complaints - except the elderly couple. Officials noted the duo didn't report any issue to the station master or RPF on duty, and no crowding was flagged by staff on board.Calling the duo's decision not to board a personal choice, the railways denied any service lapse. It also cited refund rules, saying confirmed tickets are non-refundable unless cancelled or a TDR is filed four hours before departure.However, the railways' own letter dated May 6, 2022, had admitted a spike in ticketless travel and called for issuing unreserved tickets to curb revenue loss - a point the consumer forum said backed the couple's claim.Holding the railways responsible for the couple being unable to board the crowded train during its two-minute halt at 11.53 pm at KJM, the panel said internal records can't override on-ground realities. It ruled the couple faced financial loss and mental agony due to a clear deficiency in service, especially when the full fare was collected.In March this year, the consumer commission ordered the railways to refund Rs 892.5 and pay the complainants Rs 5,000 for deficiency of service, mental agony, and Rs 3000 as litigation costs.","Purna Ramakrishna and his wife Hymavathi booked sleeper class tickets on Guwahati Express for March 29, 2022, from Krishnarajapuram (KJM) Railway Station to Vijayawada on April 13.

CHANDIGARH: The concept of ""deemed confirmation"" cannot override an employer's power to analyse work, conduct and behaviour of a probationer to ensure suitability in service, the Punjab and Haryana high court said, dismissing a petition filed by a former judicial officer of Haryana Civil Services (judicial branch).Upholding the dismissal of the petitioner, Ankur Lal, a division bench comprising Chief Justice Sheel Nagu and Justice Sumeet Goel said ""deemed confirmation"" was ""a perilous concept in service jurisprudence which has long been discarded"", since it erodes into the power of the employer to assess work, conduct and behaviour of the probationer. Besides, it would mean even a person of questionable integrity could enter judicial services, the judges added.""If deemed confirmation is brought into play, notwithstanding the adverse remarks, including that of 'integrity doubtful' based on lacklustre performance, conduct and behaviour of the petitioner, then an anomalous situation would arise where the probationer, despite being unfit for confirmation, is deemed to be confirmed. This would bring into the service a judge of doubtful integrity, whose service record is tainted with adverse remarks.This would be deleterious to the very concept of probity on which the entire judicial system stands,"" the bench said.The petitioner had sought directions to quash the recommendation dated July 23, 2012, for termination of his probationary service as civil judge (junior division). Appointed on Feb 13, 2008, Lal was placed on probation for two years, a period later extended by the high court administration.Following a complaint received from the Ferozepur Jhirka Bar Association, the then acting Chief Justice referred the matter to the administrative committee. On July 18, 2012, the committee recommended Lal's termination in view of his conduct and overall service record during his posting in Bhiwani.Lal, in his petition, argued that under Rule 7.3 of the Rules of 1951, after completing two years of probation plus an extension of one year, and in the backdrop of available vacancies in the cadre, he should have been deemed confirmed.","The Punjab and Haryana high court dismisses a petition filed by a former judicial officer.

Poll Should police procedures regarding arrests be more strictly regulated? Yes, to protect individual rights. No, current regulations are sufficient.

MUMBAI: The Bombay high court vacation bench on Friday declared the arrest of Anchor Group director Hemang Shah , 50, by Mumbai Police's Economic Offences Wing (EOW) as illegal, citing failure by police to produce him before a magistrate in 24 hours. The court ordered his immediate release from Arthur Road Jail.The vacation bench, comprising Justices Gauri Godse and Somasekhar Sundaresan, noted that chat messages between the wives of the two brothers supported Hemang Shah's claim that his arrest and continued custody were intended to recover the settlement amount in mediation between family members. The arrest was based on allegations of defrauding his elder brother, Mehul Shah, of Rs 67 crore.Hemang Shah petitioned the HC, arguing that his arrest was illegal since he was not produced before a magistrate within 24 hours as required by law. He was detained at Delhi airport at 5.30 pm on May 17 and produced in court only at 10.45 pm on May 18. The HC agreed, stating that his arrest ""without producing him before the nearest magistrate within 24 hours is completely illegal"" and infringes on fundamental rights under Article 22(2), which mandates such production.The FIR by the elder brother was lodged with Malabar Hill police station in South Mumbai at 2.14 am, and a Look Out Circular (LOC) was issued at the police station's request. The dispute, being resolved before a mediator, is between Hemang on one side and his brother and their father on the other. The FIR was filed during mediation, and Hemang, scheduled to fly to Muscat from Delhi on May 17, was apprehended at the airport due to the LOC.Police stated they arrested him on May 18 after the immigration department handed him over at 4.30 am, and then he was brought to Mumbai. Senior counsel for the elder brother-the complainant-argued that the immigration officers cannot be considered police officers, and hence his custody after being ""accosted"" at the airport was not an ""arrest"" by cops.The EOW's arrest memo states he was arrested on May 18 at 7.30 pm. The HC bench said, ""In our view, the act of the Immigration Officers to accost the petitioner or detain him on 17th May 2025 at 1730 hours is the act of arrest, and therefore the period of 24 hours as contemplated under Section 58 of BNS and Article 22(2) of the Constitution of India shall begin on 17th May 2025 at 1730 hours."""," Bombay high court declares arrest of Anchor Group director Hemang Shah as illegal.

MUMBAI: After over three decades at Kotak Mahindra Bank, Shanti Ekambaram, the group's long-serving executive and currently the bank's deputy MD, will retire on Oct 31, 2025. Her exit is the latest in a string of senior-level departures following founder Uday Kotak 's decision to step down from executive responsibilities in Sept 2023. She is one of the few women leaders who currently hold an executive position in banking.Ekambaram joined the Kotak group in 1991 and played a key role in its evolution from a financial services firm into a private sector bank. She led various businesses across investment banking, capital markets, corporate banking, treasury and consumer banking.

To strengthen the leadership team, the bank has named Paritosh Kashyap as whole-time director, subject to regulatory nod. A Kotak veteran with over 30 years at the firm, Kashyap currently heads wholesale banking. His familiarity with the institution's risk-heavy verticals is expected to bring continuity.Besides Ekambaram, another woman leader Kaku Nakhate, CEO of Bank of America, is also stepping down. A.

US-China tech tensions 'escalate'



Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has publicly praised President Donald Trump while sharply criticising the Biden administration ’s export controls on artificial intelligence (AI) chips to China, calling the policy 'a failure' that cost US companies billions. Speaking at the Computex 2025 tech conference in Taipei, Huang applauded Trump’s plan to roll back the Biden-era AI export restrictions, saying the prior policy was based on “fundamentally flawed” assumptions.“President Trump realises it’s exactly the wrong goal,” Huang said, referencing the Biden administration’s approach that blocked exports to China entirely and categorised countries into three tiers, news agency Reuters reported.Trump officials are now considering replacing that system with a global licensing regime aimed at preserving US leverage in trade talks.Under the Biden rules, Huang said Nvidia’s share of the Chinese AI market plummeted from 95% to 50%, while Chinese firms like Huawei capitalised, accelerating the country’s domestic semiconductor industry.“All in all, the export control was a failure,” Huang stated.“The assumptions that led to the AI diffusion rule have been proven to be fundamentally flawed,” he added.Despite US efforts to slow Chinese AI development, Huang noted that research there continues at scale, powered by massive domestic investment. He estimated China’s AI market could hit $50 billion in 2025—representing a critical opportunity for Nvidia, if re-entry is allowed.“The competition in China is really intense. They would love for us never to go back,” Huang added.Nvidia has already taken a $5.5 billion hit due to the chip restrictions and projects an additional $15 billion in revenue loss related to its restricted H20 AI chips . The company is now designing a version of its next-generation Blackwell chip with slower memory to comply with current rules.Earlier this week, Beijing slammed Washington for what it called “discriminatory” measures after US authorities warned firms against using Chinese chips like Huawei’s Ascend.","N Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang blasts Biden-era AI chip export policy.

NEW DELHI: Maharashtra police have launched a probe against a senior doctor in Latur for allegedly directing a colleague to ""kill"" a Covid patient during the pandemic in 2021.According to officials, the probe follows the release of an audio clip of a conversation between the accused, Dr. Shashikant Deshpande, and Dr. Shashikant Dange on social media platforms.Dr Deshpande was then posted as additional district surgeon at the Udgir Government Hospital in Latur, while Dr Dange, who was posted at a Covid-19 care centre, news agency PTI reported.In the conversation, Dr Deshpande was heard saying, ""Don't allow anyone to go inside, just kill that Dayami woman,"" To this, Dr Dange responded cautiously, noting that oxygen support had already been reduced.The patient, Kausar Fatima, wife of Dayami Ajimoddin Gaussoddin (53), had later recovered from the disease.After a complaint, the Udgir city police filed an FIR against Deshpande on May 24 under legal provisions for deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings and other offences.As per the FIR, the complainant said that in 2021, during the pandemic, his wife Kausar Fatima (then aged 41), tested positive for Covid.She was admitted as an inpatient at the government hospital in Udgir on April 15, 2021, and Covid treatment was being provided in a building opposite an eye hospital on Nanded Road, under the management of the hospital. Dr Dange was treating Covid-19 patients at that centre.The woman remained admitted there for 10 days. Around the seventh day of her admission, her husband was sitting beside Dr Dange while he was having lunch.At that moment, Dr Dange, who received a call from Dr Deshpande, placed the phone on speaker and continued the conversation regarding hospital matters.During the call, Dr Deshpande enquired about bed availability.When Dr Dange informed him that there were no vacant beds, the man claimed that he distinctly heard Dr Deshpande saying, ""Kill the Dayami patient. You're used to dealing with such people."" He also allegedly made a caste-based slur during the conversation, as per the man's complaint.The man said he was shocked, but chose to remain silent at the time since his wife was still undergoing treatment. A few days later, his wife recovered and was discharged.However, on May 2, 2025, the audio clip of the purported conversation surfaced on social media.The man said hearing the same disturbing remarks again deeply hurt him and offended his religious sentiments, especially the alleged use of derogatory caste-related comments, following which he lodged the police complaint.According to officials, Deshpande's statement has been recorded and his phone has been seized.According to inspector Dilip Gade, the police were verifying the authenticity of the audio clip.""He is out of district and will come tomorrow. After that, we will collect his mobile phone and conduct an inquiry,"" Gade said.","Dr Shashikant Deshpande allegedly directed a colleague to ""kill"" a Covid patient during the pandemic in 2021.

Jaire Alexander’s future is uncertain in Green Bay Packers

Las Vegas Raiders may consider a Jaire Alexander trade if cost is low





The NFL offseason brings many surprises. One of them includes Green Bay Packers cornerback Jaire Alexander. He is 27 years old and signed a big $84 million deal. But injuries have slowed him down. The Las Vegas Packers may not want to keep paying him. There are talks that he could be traded or cut. A new report says the Las Vegas Raiders might want him. Many fans and experts are now watching this closely. The deal could happen soon if nothing changes for the Green Bay Packers.On May 27, 2025, Cody Benjamin from CBS Sports said the Las Vegas Raiders could go after Jaire Alexander. The Green Bay Packers already asked him to change his contract. But it is not clear if he agreed. Jaire Alexander has had injuries in three of the last four seasons. He missed many games due to shoulder and back problems.In May 2022, the Green Bay Packers gave him a four-year, $84 million deal. At that time, it made him one of the top-paid players at his position. But now, the team is not sure about keeping the contract. His injuries and salary are both problems.If the Green Bay Packers cut him after June 1, they can save some money on the cap over two years.That makes it easier for the team to rebuild their defence. This is why the trade rumors are growing stronger each day.The Las Vegas Raiders made changes in March and April 2025. They signed Eric Stokes and picked Darien Porter in the draft. They also let go of Jack Jones. But the team still needs a strong slot corner. Their current group has little experience.Ian Rapoport said on May 28, 2025, on NFL Network, “The Raiders may be open to adding a veteran if the money works.”Jaire Alexander plays on the outside, not in the slot. But if he becomes a free agent and lowers his price, the Las Vegas Raiders might give him a chance. Jaire Alexander's future with the Green Bay Packers remains uncertain due to recurring injuries and a substantial cap hit. The team is reportedly considering releasing him after June 1 to save over $17 million in cap space.Also Read: “That's My Guy,” Quarterback Jordan Love Shares His Thoughts On Jaire Alexander",Jaire Alexander's future with the Green Bay Packers remains uncertain due to recurring injuries and a substantial cap hit.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Delhi Election Results 2025: Why AAP Lost,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/delhi-election-results-2025-aap-lost-reasons-arvind-kejriwal-new-delhi-manish-sisodia-bjp-modi-incumbency-corruptio-sheesh-mahal-liquor-freebies-congress-rahul/articleshow/118023276.cms,"Here are 10 reasons behind AAP's defeat:



Ten years of incumbency

Liquor scam, Sheesh Mahal dent Kejriwal's 'imandaar' image

No tie-up, Congress did strategic campaigning

Flood of freebies but no next-level of development

BJP focuses on Kejriwal, Hindutva takes back seat

BJP's latent vote

Rahul roasted Kejriwal as payback for Haryana

MCD with AAP: No excuses

Steady exodus of AAP leaders

AAP goes negative

The BJP on Saturday pulled off a major political upset by unseating the Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ) from Delhi after over 10 years. As per the latest Election Commission data, the BJP may win around 48 seats and the Kejriwal-led party may secure around 22 seats in the 70-seat Assembly.BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in a fierce contest from the New Delhi seat by a margin of 4,089 votes. Verma, 47, bagged 30,088 votes, while Kejriwal and Congress' Sandeep Dikshit got 25,999 votes and 4,568 votes.Kejriwal conceded his defeat and hoped that the BJP will fulfill all its promises.""We accept the mandate of the people with great humility. I congratulate the BJP for this victory and I hope they will fulfil all the promises for which people have voted for them,"" Kejriwal said in a video address posted on X.In the evening as the results were decalred, PM Modi kicked off his victory speech with a powerful chant of ""Yamuna Maiya ki Jai"". PM Modi declared that the people of Delhi were experiencing both relief and joy -- relief from the ""disaster"" (AAP-da governance) and joy in embracing a new era under BJP rule. ""I had written a letter to every Delhi resident, urging them to give the BJP a chance to serve in the 21st century...Today, I bow my head in gratitude to every family in Delhi for trusting us. You have given us love with an open heart, and I assure you that we will return it manifold through rapid development,"" PM Modi said.The Prime Minister also attacked the AAP over allegations of corruption against its leaders, saying that all links of such charges will be probed and those who ""looted"" money will have to return it.With the BJP set to regain control of Delhi after 27 years, what went wrong for the Aam Aadmi Party?After governing Delhi for a decade, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) faced significant anti-incumbency.While AAP achieved impressive results in health and education during its first two terms, and kept voters happy with power and water subsidies, unfulfilled promises, such as improved air quality, became major poll issues.The AAP's assertion that the BJP government at the Centre was creating roadblocks in its functioning began to be increasingly seen by voters as excuses, especially after ten years in power.The BJP's ""double engine"" promise, suggesting seamless governance between the central and state levels, appealed to voters against the backdrop of AAP's constant conflicts with the Centre. Furthermore, internal disarray within the AAP, with senior leaders facing jail time, added to the challenges of incumbency .The image of Arvind Kejriwal as an anti-corruption crusader suffered a setback due to several factors, most notably the controversy surrounding the now-scrapped liquor policy.The BJP accused the AAP government of turning Delhi into a ""city of drunkards"" with the new policy, and receiving crores in kickbacks from those who opened the vends.Probes by central agencies led to the arrest of top AAP leaders, including Arvind Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia, and Sanjay Singh. These arrests forced Sisodia to step down as deputy chief minister and kept the AAP in ""firefighting mode"", distracting from fulfilling its 2020 poll promises.Additionally, the ""Sheesh Mahal"" controversy, referring to the renovated residence of the chief minister, further dented Kejriwal's image. The BJP further highlighted a Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) report that indicated the renovation cost had increased from an initial estimate of Rs 7.91 crore to Rs 33.66 crore by completion.AAP has been synonymous with Arvind Kejriwal since its inception. Kejriwal, initially seen as an agent of change with his untucked shirt and no-nonsense demeanor, resonated with the common person.However, the anti-corruption image of Kejriwal and his party suffered irreparable damage, specially after the AAP leader's arrest in March 2024 on corruption allegations and his subsequent resignation as CM.While he was later granted bail, the leadership transition to Atishi and the circumstances surrounding Kejriwal's arrest damaged the party's image and cohesion.The absence of an alliance with the Congress party and the Congress's strategic campaigning likely contributed to the AAP's loss.In previous elections, the AAP had significantly reduced the Congress's presence in the Delhi assembly.Attempts to convince Congress workers to collaborate with AAP volunteers reportedly led to an ""existential crisis"" among them.The Congress decided to campaign aggressively against the AAP, sensing ""anger building up against the AAP"". Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra attacked the AAP in the final days of the Delhi campaign.The Congress further claimed the AAP did not want an alliance, with Kejriwal announcing all 70 candidates early on.The rise of AAP in Delhi has been congruous with the decline of the Congress. In 2013, AAP won 28 seats with a 29.49% vote share, while the Congress tally decreased to 8 seats from 43 in 2008. In 2015, Congress suffered a 15% decline in its vote share, while the AAP saw its support base rise by around 15%.While AAP's welfare schemes, such as free electricity and bus travel for women, initially garnered support, a lack of focus on infrastructure development and maintenance became a significant issue.The poor condition of roads and sewers across Delhi angered voters.Overflowing drains, potholed roads, and irregular garbage collection contributed to the party's unpopularity.The AAP's control over the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) meant it could not deflect blame for these issues onto the BJP. Voters in middle- and upper-middle-class areas were particularly affected by the deteriorating infrastructure.AAP's origins trace back to Anna Hazare’s anti-corruption movement, positioning the party as an alternative to the Congress in 2013.While AAP secured mandates in 2015 and 2020, their repeated promises and ""freebies"" seem to have lost their appeal.The promise of piped water connections for all in 2015 remains unfulfilled, as does the promise of full statehood for Delhi and the ""Rozgar Budget"" aimed at creating 20 lakh jobs.Kejriwal himself admitted that he had failed to fulfill three promises: cleaning the Yamuna, providing clean drinking water, and upgrading Delhi's roads. This acknowledgment gave the BJP an opportunity to attack the AAP, with Amit Shah mocking Kejriwal's promise to purify the Yamuna.The BJP's campaign strategy focused primarily on targeting Arvind Kejriwal and his government, rather than emphasising Hindutva, as it has often done during campainging in other state elections as well as previous Delhi polls.This approach likely resonated with a broader segment of the population, including those who may not have been inclined to support a religiously charged campaign. By focusing on issues such as corruption and governance, the BJP effectively undermined AAP's credibility and appealed to a wider range of voters.The BJP also focused on hyper-local issues such as air pollution, traffic, and public safety, and engaged with local Resident Welfare Associations. They also promoted central government schemes.The BJP also targeted specific demographics, including Purvanchalis and slum dwellers, and utilised an aggressive digital campaign with AI-enhanced content and memes targeting AAP.The BJP's consistent performance in the Lok Sabha polls in Delhi indicated a latent voter base that the party successfully mobilised this time around for the assembly elections.Despite AAP's strong performance in the assembly elections, the BJP had consistently swept Lok Sabha elections in the national capital, winning all seven seats.This pre-existing support base provided a foundation for the BJP's campaign and likely contributed to their victory.The BJP also strategically fielded Parvesh Verma, a strong Jat leader, in the New Delhi constituency, signaling their intention to win back the confidence of the Jat community, which had previously favoured AAP in Delhi elections.During the Delhi Assembly elections, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi launched strong criticisms against Arvind Kejriwal, which may have been payback for events in Haryana. Gandhi's attacks covered a range of issues, including alleged corruption, unfulfilled promises, and inaction on key issues.Like the BJP, Gandhi attacked Kejriwal over the alleged liquor scam and accused him of living in a ""Sheesh Mahal"" while engaging in corrupt practices.Gandhi said that Kejriwal made false promises, ""similar to Prime Minister Narendra Modi"", particularly regarding cleaning the Yamuna River. He also challenged Kejriwal to drink Delhi's tap water, implying it was still polluted despite promises to clean it.The Aam Aadmi Party's (AAP) win in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) in 2022 proved to be a double-edged sword, ultimately hurting the party instead of helping it. AAP had promised a cleaner city with world-class roads, but it fell short on both accounts. The MCD House was in limbo, and the Standing Committee, which controls all financial powers, was never formed. The AAP repeatedly accused the Centre of creating hurdles through the Lieutenant Governor and stalling projects.This time around, voters held the AAP accountable for the deteriorating civic infrastructure across Delhi.AAP's performance in the MCD was a letdown for the people of Delhi. The party failed to address critical issues such as clearing garbage, repairing roads, and cleaning clogged sewers. Erratic water supply and overflowing sewers that were never repaired because Rs 4,000 crore for the Delhi Jal Board was not released further hurt the party.Senior party leaders stated that the MCD functioning had collapsed under the AAP, and no work was being done, leading to frustration among councillors.The steady departure of senior leaders from AAP over time might have also weakened the party's organisational structure and public image.The exit of prominent figures like Prashant Bhushan, Yogendra Yadav, Mayank Gandhi, and Kumar Vishwas, who had dared to disagree with Arvind Kejriwal, and repeatedly accused Kejriwal of having an ""autocratic"" style of leadership.Resignation of senior leaders like Kailash Gahlot, who cited the party's focus on political agenda over fulfilling promises, along with internal challenges, signalled internal discord.The BJP had termed Gahlot's resignation a ""courageous move"".Negative campaigning by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) centered on issues like Yamuna River pollution, the Delhi Police, and the Election Commission (EC) may have affected public perception of the AAP government.In the lead up to the polls, Kejriwal accused the BJP-led Haryana government of poisoning the Yamuna River, which supplies drinking water to Delhi. He claimed that the Haryana government deliberately sent polluted waters to Delhi to create an artificial water scarcity and blame the AAP.The AAP also repeatedly levelled accusations of voter fraud and irregularities against the BJP as well as the EC.AAP alleged that the Election Commission and Delhi Police were shielding BJP workers and accused them of ""hooliganism"". Kejriwal wrote to the Chief Election Commissioner, expressing concern over the intimidation and harassment of AAP volunteers by BJP workers. The EC responded that no written complaints could be traced in most cases but assured that all registered complaints are investigated.Kejriwal further criticised the Election Commission for allegedly refusing to make Form 17C public, a document detailing the number of votes polled at each booth. AAP then launched a website, transparentelections.in, claiming to upload Form 17C data for all constituencies to present the data in an accessible format.The EC dismissed Kejriwal's claims regarding Form 17C, stating that copies had already been provided to polling agents at each booth after voting, as per Rule 49S of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961.","BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal.

US President Donald Trump is pulling back his nomination of tech billionaire Jared Isaacman to serve as Nasa administrator just days before he was set to receive a confirmation vote in the senate, said a person familiar with the decision on Saturday.The individual spoke on condition of anonymity, as they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter, says AP.Trump had announced last December during the presidential transition that Isaacman was his pick for Nasa administrator. Isaacman, founder and CEO of the payment processing company Shift4, has been closely linked to Elon Musk since he purchased his first SpaceX flight in 2021.Isaacman has flown multiple missions with SpaceX and took part in the first private spacewalk. He testified at his senate confirmation hearing on April 9, and a committee vote on his nomination had been expected soon.During his committee hearing, Isaacman distanced himself from Musk by pledging to prioritize a lunar landing if confirmed as Nasa administrator—a goal Musk had dismissed as a “distraction.”Nasa has been without a senate-confirmed administrator since January 20, when Bill Nelson stepped down.SpaceX is owned by Musk, a Trump supporter and adviser who recently stepped down from his role as head of the department of government efficiency, or DOGE.

The judge's data dilemma in the Google search case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/the-judges-data-dilemma-in-the-google-search-case/articleshow/121544315.cms,"Liz Reid, of Google, speaks about new search AI capabilities in Mountain View, Calif, on May 20, 2025.





Data played a starring role in the government's successful antitrust suit against Google accusing it of illegally protecting its monopoly in online search. Now, steps to force Google to unlock its data trove could figure prominently in a ruling on how to address the tech giant's dominance, antitrust experts say.On Friday, the federal judge overseeing the case, Amit P Mehta, heard closing arguments in federal court in Washington on what corrective measures, known as remedies, he should order to restore competition. The government's requests include forcing Google to share its search engine results and advertising data with rivals.Justice Department lawyers have repeatedly described data as ""the oxygen"" for search engines. And in his ruling against Google in August, Mehta recounted in detail how the company harvests vast amounts of data from user searches and web crawling, then stores and analyzes the data to rule the lucrative market for internet search.Google, he noted, collects nine times as much user search data every day as all its rivals combined. And as more data is fed into Google's software, the results that the search engine returns on everything from biology to bluejeans become more accurate and relevant to the person seeking information.Better search performance, in turn, attracts more users and more advertisers, Mehta wrote. It's a flywheel that steadily enhances Google's search and acts as a barrier to competition.""At every stage in the search process,"" the judge wrote, ""user data is a critical input that directly improves quality.""His decision on how to fix Google's monopoly has the potential to reshape competition on the internet, particularly as a new age of generative artificial intelligence takes off and is expected to overhaul the way people search for information online. Tech companies are racing to win consumers over with chatbots and other tools that can answer more sophisticated questions, drawing from vast pools of data.Mehta has already indicated that AI may factor into his deliberations, noting during a recent hearing the rapid development of the technology since the lawsuit went to trial in the fall of 2023.To fix Google's search monopoly, the Justice Department and the group of states that brought the case have recommended a range of sanctions, from simply prohibiting anticompetitive deals with companies that Google pays to make it the automatic search engine to forcing the company to sell off its market-leading Chrome browser.The government's data-related proposal falls somewhere in between. It includes requiring Google to share user search information and license its search index, a database of hundreds of billions of webpages scored by popularity, quality and relevance.In late April, Mehta said he looked at his job as weighing actions across a ""remedy spectrum."" At one end was a breakup order, he said, while at the minimalist end was a ban on illegal deals with browser and smartphone companies.In the middle were ""forward-looking remedies,"" he said, without elaborating on his thinking.Given the evidence in the case, a data-sharing order would be ""a conceptually appropriate remedy,"" since the exclusive deals increased Google's data advantage, said Douglas Melamed, a former senior official in the Justice Department's antitrust division and now a visiting fellow at the Stanford Law School.Still, a data-sharing project raises its own set of questions. In court testimony, Google emphasized the privacy concerns of passing user search data along to other companies.The government's data proposal also calls for access to software that uses data as an ingredient but was built by Google's engineers.""It looks like an administrative headache -- how much data, how often, and access to Google's crown jewel?"" said John Yun, an economist at the Antonin Scalia Law School at George Mason University.Google has described the government's data-sharing plan as the equivalent of a breakup -- a forced surrender of its intellectual property, allowing competitors to reverse-engineer its technology.""The proposal on data sharing is so far-reaching, so extraordinary,"" that it ""feels like de facto divestiture of search,"" Sundar Pichai , CEO of Alphabet, Google's parent company, testified in court last month.The history of forced asset sharing as a solution for monopolistic behavior is mixed. In 1956, as part of an antitrust settlement with the government, AT&T agreed to license its patents, including for transistors, the tiny switches that are the building blocks of electronic circuitry. That opened the door to an independent semiconductor industry in what became Silicon Valley.But the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which was intended to increase competition for local telephone service by mandating that companies share network capacity, didn't result in much innovation.Eventually, genuine competition emerged, but it came from mobile wireless and cable broadband companies, said Jon Nuechterlein, a telecom expert and former general counsel of the Federal Trade Commission. Landline voice service has fallen from nearly 100% of households in 1996 to about 25% today.""Outside competition emerged independent of all the regulatory churn,"" said Nuechterlein, a distinguished scholar at George Washington University's Competition Law Center.Today, AI is the big unknown in search. Chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Anthropic's Claude, the AI-powered search engine Perplexity, and others are potential Google disrupters. Google itself is investing heavily in AI-enhanced search, which Pichai recently described as ""a total reimagining of search.""While Mehta has more recently acknowledged the rapid advance of AI, his ruling in August noted that the technology had yet to overtake traditional search.""AI has not supplanted the traditional ingredients that define general search,"" he wrote. ""Importantly, generative AI has not (or, at least, not yet) eliminated or materially reduced the need for user data to deliver quality search results.""Some antitrust experts say Mehta's decision could affect search and AI.""The explosion of AI makes it even more important to have strong data-sharing remedies,"" said Gene Kimmelman, a former senior official in the Justice Department's antitrust division. ""AI and search overlap, and both ride on data.""","Google collects nine times as much user search data every day as all its rivals combined. Justice Department lawyers have repeatedly described data as ""the oxygen"" for search engines. Google has described the government's data-sharing plan as the equivalent of a breakup.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121544334,imgsize-930627,width-400,resizemode-4/121544334.jpg"

NEW YORK: The latest crime thriller gripping New York is the alleged kidnapping of a wealthy Italian man whose captors attempted to torture the crypto millionaire into giving up his bitcoin password.It began amid the backdrop of wild parties, immortalized in pop culture through films like ""The Wolf of Wall Street,"" in a posh Manhattan nightclub where the nouveau riche and flashy Wall Street bros congregate.It ended on the morning of May 23, when a man ran to a police officer near Mulberry and Prince streets in the Soho district of Manhattan.The barefoot man claimed he had just escaped a luxurious apartment where he was held captive for 17 days after entering the United States.Police arrived at the scene and arrested John Woeltz, 37, dubbed ""the crypto king of Kentucky"" by tabloids, who is facing charges of kidnapping, criminal possession of weapons, assault and unlawful imprisonment.Woeltz's 24-year-old assistant was also detained but does not face the same charges.A second man, William Duplessie, 33, who is the founder of the startup Pangea Blockchain International, turned himself in on Tuesday and was charged similarly to Woeltz.Duplessie, who originally hails from Miami, appeared in court Friday wearing a jail uniform.- Philosophy degree -According to details reported by local media, the presumed victim is Italian cryptocurrency entrepreneur Michael Valentino Teofrasto Carturan, who visited John Woeltz's rented home -- which goes for $30,000 a month -- upon arriving from Italy on May 6.Once there, Woeltz and Duplessie confiscated his electronic devices and passport, and demanded the access code to his bitcoin assets, police said.After his refusal, the two men allegedly tortured Carturan, striking him with a rifle, pointing the weapon in his face and taking him to the building's fifth floor, where they threatened to throw him out the window, local media reported.""He's a 37-year-old man with no prior criminal record. He's a college graduate with a degree in philosophy. He has been very successful in the technology world,"" Woeltz's lawyer Wayne Ervin Gosnell said during a court hearing Thursday.The defense requested Woeltz's conditional release in the state of New York in exchange for a $2 million bond.Gosnell also noted that it has been said Woeltz ""owns a private jet, he owns a helicopter. That is not true.""- Lavish lifestyle -Though Woeltz has neither a jet nor a helicopter, he leads an exceedingly lavish lifestyle, according to the New York Post and TMZ, which published racy images of the suspects partying at The Box, a New York nightclub.The Post also mentioned frequent parties at the Soho apartment that is the scene of the alleged kidnapping.In recent months, cases of kidnappings or attempted abductions in the cryptocurrency world have multiplied globally as bitcoin, the most capitalized cryptocurrency, has grown to historical peaks.For Adam Healy, CEO of Station70, a firm specializing in crypto protection, these crimes are not new -- he worked on a case years ago when an American traveling to Egypt was kidnapped for his crypto assets.""I think that the frequency and the ruthlessness is increasing,"" Healy said.In the last six to eight months, he has seen ""a significant uptick in those that are known to hold crypto or executives at crypto firms, things along those lines, getting targeted by a wide range of different criminals.""Healy attributed part of the uptick in crime to the rising price of bitcoin.""It's a bigger target,"" he said, and they are boosted by the ease with which massive payloads can be transferred with no oversight -- as long as the crypto user can log in.""Historically, if you wanted to kidnap something that was high net worth and they had, I don't know, ten million dollars in their JP Morgan account, it was kind of hard to get to,"" Healy said.""You couldn't just go to the bank and get a million dollars out.""","The alleged kidnapping of a wealthy Italian man is the latest crime thriller gripping New York.

Indian-origin man pleads guilty to marriage fraud in West Virginia; he claimed domestic violence to get green card,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/indian-origin-man-pleads-guilty-to-marriage-fraud-in-west-virginia-he-claimed-domestic-violence-to-get-green-card/articleshow/121542186.cms,"Indian man, Akaash Prakash Makwana, admits to marriage fraud in West Virginia, US.





29-year-old Aakash Prakash Makwana, an Indian citizen, has pleaded guilty to a marriage fraud which also involved identity theft -- as part of a scheme to evade US immigration laws. US Justice Department said Makwana arrived in the US on a J-1 nonimmigrant visa to work in hotel hospitality and culinary services. This visa is valid for one year and so he conspired with others to marry a US citizen to remain in the US.Makwana arrived in the US in 2019 and continued to stay even though his visa expired in 2020. In 2021, he married a US citizen for $10,000 so that he could apply for a Green card. But in doing so, he falsified a residential lease agreement to make it appear that he and the US citizen whom he married lived together and also added the US citizen's name to his bank accounts and utility bills.Makwana admitted that he committed identity theft when he included the name and signature of the residential property's manager on a false lease agreement.When this marriage scheme failed, Makwala filed a Form I-360 with the USCIS claiming that he suffered domestic violence and emotional abuse at the hands of his US citizen partner. He has now admitted that he filed the petition to continue to stay in the US while his claimed were being considered.Kalee Ann Huff, a 28-year-old US citizen, also pleaded guilty to this marriage fraud. Huff's brother-in-law Joseph Sanchez was part of the conspiracy and he also pleaded guilty. “This case reflects another unacceptable attempt to undermine our nation’s immigration laws, and the commitment of the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of West Virginia to enforce those laws to uphold public safety, national security, and the rule of law in our country,” said Acting United States Attorney Lisa G Johnston.","29-year-old Aakash Prakash Makwana, an Indian citizen, has pleaded guilty to a marriage fraud.

'He inspired me': Stranger’s TikTok helps teen worker at Burger King raise over $130K for college,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/he-inspired-me-strangers-tiktok-helps-teen-worker-at-burger-king-raise-over-130k-for-college/articleshow/121542124.cms,"



A Georgia teenager who clocked into his Burger King shift just hours after graduating high school saw his college hopes transformed, thanks to an outpouring of generosity that has raised over $130,000 (£102,000) and counting.Mykale Baker, 18, became the face of quiet determination when a stranger spotted him working at a Burger King in Dacula, Georgia, still wearing his graduation stole and medal. That moment, shared by Maria Mendoza in a TikTok video she posted “without thinking,” captured hearts online, and sparked the creation of a fundraiser called 'From Burger King to a College Dream'.The campaign had a goal of $60,000, but smashed through that target in just ten days. Fuelled by thousands of donations, most from complete strangers, the total climbed past $130,000 by Saturday afternoon.“I feel happy,” Baker told 11 Alive. “I just want to say thank you to my parents and all the people that see the good in me and believe in me, and donated all that money to me.”The teen said he had been unsure about his next steps after graduation due to financial constraints, and had hoped to attend trade school.Now, those dreams look within reach.Mendoza, who started the fundraiser, said she was struck by Baker’s kindness and work ethic, The New York Post said.“He was so kind, so polite,” she recalled. “Radiating joy, even after such a big day. His dedication and quiet strength really moved me. I felt called to do something to recognise that.”One anonymous donor left a note with their contribution, writing, “Remember, this money is for you. Not for mama, the church, or others in need. It’s an investment in your future. Invest it in yourself wisely and you’ll have much more to share with others down the road!”When Mendoza returned to the Burger King days later to share the news of the donations, Baker was overwhelmed and brought to tears.“I’m just grateful I got to do something for him,” Mendoza added. “He inspired me.”","Mykale Baker, 18, was working at Burger King in Dacula, Georgia.

More concerned about teeth than constituents: Gale Brewer faces backlash over demanding dental care for migrants,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/more-concerned-about-teeth-than-constituents-gale-brewer-faces-backlash-over-demanding-dental-care-for-migrants/articleshow/121541158.cms,"



Upper West Side councilwoman Gale Brewer is facing backlash after calling for free dental care for migrants, after she revealed already have paid up to $10,000 out of her own pocket to cover their dental expenses.The 73-year-old Democrat made the plea during a budget hearing with the NYC Health Department on May 23, where she criticised the lack of attention to migrants’ full health needs.“Is someone paying attention to all of their health needs?” she demanded. “They have a lot of health needs. Forget the dental! I’m already out $8,000–$10,000 on the dental. So who is paying attention to them?”Brewer, who earns $148,500 as a council member, later told The New Post that she has been covering the cost of procedures such as root canals and cavity fillings for several migrants, especially young people she supports personally.“I’ve been doing this kind of stuff for years, especially helping younger people,” said Brewer, who, along with her late husband Cal Snyder, fostered 35 children. “This is nothing new for me.”She also pressed acting health commissioner Dr Michelle Morse to improve awareness among migrants about the city’s existing free healthcare options. Brewer said many asylum seekers, particularly young delivery workers, are enrolled in city-funded health insurance schemes like NYC Care but have no idea how to use them.“And I assume you can’t do dental, because you can’t get dental for Americans — let alone for anybody else. They all have dental issues.”Brewer added, “I happen to know a lot of asylum seekers and support them.”“These are young guys. They’re pretty lost” she said, referring to what benefits the immigrants qualify for.However, her remarks have sparked criticism from some in her own district. Longtime Upper West Side activist Maria Danzilo accused Brewer of ignoring her constituents.“This is another example of misplaced priorities from Gale Brewer,” Danzilo said.“It’s unfortunate that Gale feels migrants’ dental problems are more important than the needs of her own constituents. What is she doing about the healthcare needs of her community? Plenty of New Yorkers also lack medical coverage.”Morse responded by promising that the Health Department would work with city hospitals to improve outreach efforts about available healthcare services under NYC Care.City law already requires all hospitals to treat emergency patients regardless of their immigration status or ability to pay. Migrants seeking asylum are eligible for Medicaid, while minors, seniors, and pregnant women can access free healthcare regardless of immigration status.The health department declined to say whether Brewer could have referred migrants to more affordable city options rather than paying out of pocket.This isn’t the first time Brewer has made headlines during budget hearings. In March, she told correction officials that the food served at Rikers Island made her sick — and suggested the city should serve inmates “farm-to-table” meals like those at high-end Manhattan restaurants.","Upper West Side councilwoman Gale Brewer is facing backlash after calling for free dental care for migrants.

200 miles of sublime pain on a Hindu pilgrimage in Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/200-miles-of-sublime-pain-on-a-hindu-pilgrimage-in-pakistan/articleshow/121544180.cms,"Pilgrims, arriving by bus, camp overnight on the desert plain in front of the Chandragup mud volcano during their journey to the Hinglaj Devi temple in the Balochistan Province of Pakistan, May 1, 2025. (NYT News Service)





HINGOL NATIONAL PARK, PAKISTAN: When Amar Faqira's 3-year-old son abruptly lost movement in his foot last year, doctors offered little hope.As panic gripped his family, Faqira made a vow - if the boy recovered, he would make a 200-mile pilgrimage through blistering plains and jagged terrain to the Hinglaj Devi temple, a site sacred to the Hindu minority in Pakistan. It is also where Pakistan's largest annual Hindu festival is held, usually in mid-April.When the child regained strength a year later, Faqira set off in late April on a seven-day walk to the temple, nestled deep in the rust-coloured mountains of the restive Balochistan . The goddess ""heard me and healed my son,"" Faqira said before the trek, as he gathered with friends and family in his neighbourhood in Karachi. ""Why shouldn't I fulfill my vow and endure a little pain?""Faqira and two companions, wearing saffron headscarves and carrying a ceremonial flag, joined thousands of others on the gruelling journey to Hinglaj Devi. Along a winding highway and sun-scorched desert paths, groups of resolute pilgrims - mostly men but also women and children - trudged beneath the unforgiving sky, in heat that reached 45Celsius. Some bore idols of the deity, and all chanted ""Jai Mata Di"" .The pilgrimage is an act of spiritual devotion as well as cultural preservation. Pakistan's Hindus number about 4.4 million and make up less than 2% of the country's population, which is more than 96% Muslim.Hindus are often treated as second-class citizens, systemically discriminated against in housing, jobs and access to govt welfare.For many, the pilgrimage to Hinglaj Devi is comparable in significance to the Haj in Islam, a once-in-a-lifetime obligation of faith. The yearning to make the journey is also strong among Hindus in India though it is very difficult for Indians to receive visas to travel to Pakistan. States bordering Pakistan have deep spiritual links to Hinglaj Devi that are rooted in traditions predating the Partition.For much of the 20th century, the Hinglaj Devi temple remained inaccessible. The pilgrimage gained momentum only in the 1990s. A transformative shift came in the early 2000s with the construction of the Makran Coastal Highway, which links the rest of Pakistan to the Chinese-operated Gwadar deep-sea port.The highway brought unprecedented access to the temple -- it became possible to make the bulk of the journey by vehicle, taking some of the sweat out of the endeavour. Still, thousands continue to make the journey by foot. They are considered the more spiritually devoted. ""The real pilgrimage is in the pain, the feeling,"" said Faqira on the fourth day of his trek.One of his two companions collapsed from heat exhaustion after walking nearly 70 miles and had to return home by bus. Faqira carried on, his feet blistered and bandaged. Each pilgrim walks with a personal vow.Minakshi, part of a group of women dressed in yellow and red, undertook the journey to ask the goddess for a son. Nearby, 60-year-old Raj Kumari was making her seventh pilgrimage, praying for her grandson's well-being. Also on the trek was a childless couple, married since 2018.Hinglaj Devi temple is one of the sites where the remains of Sati, goddess of marital devotion and longevity, fell to Earth after her self-immolation. For many of the faithful, the pilgrimage begins with a symbolic trek to a sacred mud volcano rising from the barren landscape near the Makran Coastal Highway. At the summit, devotees toss coconuts and rose petals into the bubbling crater to seek divine permission to proceed. Many also smear volcanic clay on their faces and bodies. The next stage takes pilgrims to the Hingol River for a ritual bath. From there, they continue 28 miles to the Hinglaj Devi temple, set within a natural cave.The complex houses four shrines, the most revered being the Nani Mandir. After reaching the shrines, devotees complete the pilgrimage with an arduous, hourslong trek across seven mountains, before returning to the temple to pray.","Hinglaj Devi temple is a site sacred to the Hindu minority in Pakistan.
