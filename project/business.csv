Enforcement Directorate names senior advocate accused in Religare laundering case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/enforcement-directorate-names-senior-advocate-accused-in-religare-laundering-case/articleshow/124467800.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: On June 20, after protests from lawyers representing several bar associations, ED was forced to withdraw summons issued to senior advocate Pratap Venugopal in connection with a money laundering probe against Religare's former chairperson Rashmi Saluja.Four months later, the agency has named Venugopal as one of the accused, along with Saluja, in its chargesheet filed in the Religare Enterprises case before a special court in Mumbai for his role in the alleged conspiracy in illegal allotment of employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs) of CHIL (Care Health Insurance Ltd), a subsidiary of Religare, in which Venugopal was an independent director and Saluja was non-executive chairperson.When contacted by TOI, Venugopal said he has ""no comments to offer"".Saluja, according to the chargesheet, has been described as the ""principal architect of the conspiracy"", who, in connivance with other former executives of the company Nitin Aggarwal, Nishant Singhal, Pratap Venugopal and Vaibhav Gawli, illegally acquired equity interest in CHIL through ESOPs. ED has termed the ESOPs thus acquired as ""proceeds of crime"" and has claimed that this was done to gain control of the company by subverting regulatory mechanisms.About the role of Venugopal, ED says he was then a retainer in Religare and had sought legal opinion on how to overturn rejection of allotment of ESOPs by regulator Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI). ED says, in return for his services, the lawyer was offered an independent director's post in CHIL and a remuneration of Rs 60 lakh.IRDAI had later directed CHIL to revoke or cancel any ESOPs allotted and also imposed a penalty of Rs 1 crore on CHIL for non-compliance with regulatory directions.The agency said 2.2 crore ESOPs were allotted to Saluja at an undervalued price of Rs 45.3 when the shares were at Rs 110 each. Later, the accused made office assistant Vaibhav Gawli to file an FIR against Burmans of Dabur, who had acquired 51% stake in the company, to prevent them from taking control of Religare.The summons to Venugopal and another senior advocate had generated sharp reactions from various bar associations, including joint pleas filed by SC Bar Association and SC Advocates-on-Record, senior advocates Mukul Rohatgi and Vijay Hansaria before the CJI-led bench of B R Gavai and Justice K Vinod Chandran while it was hearing a suo motu case regarding the summons.The bench had said it would frame guidelines for agencies and bar them from summoning advocates for legal opinion or advice rendered to clients facing prosecution.","Pratap Venugopal is one of the accused, along with Rashmi Saluja, in the Religare Enterprises case.

NMC data shows India added just 21 docs in a year when 80k graduated,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nmc-data-shows-india-added-just-21-docs-in-a-year-when-80k-graduated/articleshow/124467765.cms,"The health ministry recently told Parliament that the National Medical Commision (NMC) data shows there are 13,86,157 registered doctors in India, a number that is almost identical to the 13,86,136 it cited in the Lok Sabha in Aug last year. So, how could India have added just 21 doctors over the past year despite about 80,000 graduating in that period? Cross-checking the state-wise NMC data given last year with the state councils' rolls shows a glaring mismatch.Delhi had less than 31,500 doctors in NMC data, whereas state council data for 2020 showed more than 72,600. How did more than 40,000 doctors go missing in NMC's data for the city?Last year, NMC submitted that Kerala Medical Council has over 73,000 doctors registered with it. However, a Kerala council member told TOI the number is over 1 lakh, a difference of 36,000.Similarly, while NMC reported under 1.5 lakh in Tamil Nadu, the state council's figures are over 2 lakh.""This is not a clerical slip or a marginal miscalculation. It is a glaring 41,000-doctor gap between what the Delhi Medical Council (DMC) officially recorded and what union health ministry or NMC told Parliament. Placing incorrect, misleading or incomplete information before the Lok Sabha is a breach of Parliamentary privilege.It obstructs Members of Parliament from performing their duties, and as per Parliamentary procedure, such misrepresentation amounts to contempt of the House,"" said Dr Arun Kumar, national general secretary of United Doctors Front (UDF).UDF had filed an RTI asking for data on registered medical practitioners in Delhi. DMC responded that in 2014, the total number of registered voters for the council election was 57,749, and it was 72,636 for the 2020 elections. ""Only those who have renewed their registration can vote for the council election. So, 72,636 is authentic data as of 2020,"" said Dr Kumar. With a few hundred new registrations every year, this number ought to be even higher now.Huge variations between the actual registrations in state councils and what is submitted by NMC skew the calculation of the doctor-to-population ratio. In Delhi's case, NMC's data is over 66% less than DMC's count. In the case of Kerala, it is off by 33%.""For Delhi, a city with one of the highest patient inflows in the country, undercounting by 40,000 doctors distorts the entire healthcare planning process. They are planning to bring in compulsory bond in Delhi medical colleges, claiming doctor shortage. If they cannot get the Delhi data right, one can only wonder about other states,"" said Dr Kumar.In Sept 2020 NMC replaced erstwhile Medical Council of India, which was labelled corrupt and non-transparent in its functioning. However, five years later NMC has failed in its basic function of maintaining an updated medical registry crucial for decision-making.""NMC is totally defunct. Appointments are not made on time. Most posts have been lying vacant for more than a year. They don't even respond to communication from state councils. There has been no process to update their database or to bring in a system by which additions to the state councils will lead to automatic updation of NMC's registry,"" said a Kerala Council member.","The health ministry recently told Parliament that the National Medical Commision (NMC) data shows there are 13,86,157 registered doctors in India.

NEW DELHI: The landmark visit by Taliban foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi to India Friday saw India declaring it will upgrade its technical mission in Kabul to the level of embassy, while announcing a slew of projects and humanitarian gestures to advance ties with Afghanistan. External affairs minister S Jaishankar said cooperation between the 2 sides contributes to Afghanistan’s national development, as well as regional stability and resilience, as he announced a formal reopening of the embassy.Muttaqi said after the meeting that India too had agreed to receive Afghan diplomats here, although not at the ambassador level. While not a formal recognition of the regime in Kabul, the upgrade still marks a significant boost for diplomatic ties and ongoing efforts to remove hurdles in further deepening economic cooperation. India shut its embassy in Kabul after the return of the Taliban to Kabul in 2021 but, in June 2022, the government positioned a technical team in the embassy mainly to supervise distribution of humanitarian aid.In the meeting, Jaishankar underlined India’s concerns about cross-border border terrorism, including the activities of Pakistan based terror groups with possible links in Afghanistan, and Muttaqi assured him Taliban won’t allow any group to use the country against others.Without naming Pakistan, both sides unequivocally condemned all acts of terrorism emanating from regional countries in a joint statement, while underscoring the importance of promoting peace, stability, and mutual trust in the region.With the Taliban’s ties with Pakistan going into a tailspin over the activities of Tehreek-e-Taliban (TTP), Jaishankar also stressed India is fully committed to the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of Afghanistan and got the same assurance from Muttaqi.“We have a common commitment towards growth and prosperity. However, these are endangered by the shared threat of cross-border terrorism that both our nations face. We must coordinate efforts to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations,” said Jaishankar in his opening remarks, as he appreciated Taliban’s sensitivity towards India’s security concerns and the solidarity in the aftermath of the Pahalgam terrorist attack.Muttaqi also invited Indian companies to invest in the mining sector, saying this would help strengthen the bilateral trade and commercial relations. According to a joint statement, India expressed its willingness to assist the Afghan government in reconstructing residential buildings in the earthquake affected areas.The Indian side expressed concern about the plight of forcibly repatriated Afghan refugees, saying their dignity and livelihood is important and agreeing to help construct residences for them and continue providing material aid to rebuild their lives.Jaishankar said India’s longstanding development partnership with Afghanistan, which has seen more than 500 Indian projects spread across all 34 provinces of Afghanistan, stood renewed and announced the launch of 6 new projects. “As a contiguous neighbour and a well-wisher of the Afghan people, India has a deep interest in your development and progress,” said Jaishankar.There was also focus on sports, especially cricket, to advance cultural interactions with Jaishankar saying the emergence of Afghan cricketing talent had been truly impressive. He also committed to expanding avenues for Afghan students to pursue studies at Indian universities, citing more Indian visas for Afghan nationals in medical, business and student categories.The minister also announced a gift of 20 ambulances in a goodwill gesture of good, in addition to MRI and CT scan machines to Afghan hospitals and vaccines for immunization and cancer medicines.","India Restores Full Diplomatic Ties With Afghanistan, Upgrades Kabul Mission To Embassy in Big Move.

"Influx from Pakistan, Bangladesh fuelling disparity in population growth: Amit Shah",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/influx-from-pakistan-bangladesh-fuelling-disparity-in-population-growth-amit-shah/articleshow/124464900.cms,"NEW DELHI: Home minister Amit Shah on Friday said infiltration was the main reason for disparity in the rates of growth of numbers of different religious communities, and said that the changes in demography were a threat to country's culture and democratic ethos while vowing that govt would pursue a ""detect, delete and deport"" strategy against infiltrators.""In the 1951 census, Hindus constituted 84%, while Muslims constituted 9.8%. In 1971, Hindus constituted 82% and the Muslim population was 11%, while in 1991, Hindus constituted 81% and the Muslim community accounted for 12.12%, while in 1991, we accounted for 89%, and Muslims accounted for 14.2%. I'm talking about the populations of only two religions because I want to talk about infiltration,"" Shah saidDelivering the Narendra Mohan Smriti Lecture at Sahitya Shrishti Samman ceremony, the home minister said, ""The Muslim population has increased by 24.6 per cent, whereas the Hindu population has decreased by 4.5 per cent. I am telling you this because it hasn't happened because of the fertility rate. It has happened because of infiltration.""""Hindu population decreased in Pakistan and Bangladesh as many of them fled and took refuge in India. And the Muslim population that increased in India wasn't due to fertility, it was because many from the community infiltrated into the country,"" the home minister said.He asked people to recognise the consequences of infiltration to effect demographic shifts for democracy.""I want to say without hesitation that until every Indian understands these three issues, we cannot ensure safety for our country, it's culture, languages, and our independence. These three topics are interconnected,"" he stated and cited censuses from 1951, 1971, 1991, and 2011 to highlight the changing demography.Shah linked the sharp drop in Jharkhand's tribal population to similar incursions, announcing that the Modi govt's high-powered Demographic Mission would examine illegal migration's effects on religious and social fabric, population trends, and border security. He blamed ""vote-bank"" politics for infiltration, and said that it was ironic while Gujarat and Rajasthan have remained secure despite being border states, West Bengal has emerged as an epicentre of the serious threat. ""Some political parties do not see a threat to the nation in infiltrators; they only see a vote bank,"" he remarked, decrying Congress 's role in the religious partition of India as a profound error.Shah defended the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), which grants citizenship to Hindu, Sikh, Christian, and Buddhist refugees, as fulfilling a national pledge redeemed by Prime Minister Modi. ""Opposition parties spread lies about the CAA; by bringing it, Modi Ji performed atonement for decades of governance errors,"" he asserted. He emphasised that minorities persecuted on religious grounds in Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh since independence deserve sanctuary in India. Endorsing the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls, Shah argued that embedding infiltrators into voters' lists corrupts constitutional integrity. He reiterated that Muslim population growth stems from ""infiltration from Pakistan and Bangladesh and not because of fertility.""Infiltrators' inclusion in voter lists, he warned, taints the political process. ""When you are protecting infiltrators, you are polluting the spirit of the Constitution,"" Shah said, adding, ""We will follow the detect, delete and deport process for infiltrators."" He lambasted Congress: ""Outsiders will not decide who gets to vote whom in India. India's democracy will be run by Indians-not dictated by outsiders or Congress-backed lobbies. """"The opposition is against the SIR exercise because their vote banks are getting cut...It is EC's constitutional responsibility to clean the voters' list. You can go to court if you have any issues,"" he said.","Home minister Amit Shah said infiltration was the main reason for disparity in the rates of growth of numbers of different religious communities.

NEW DELHI: Bharatiya Janata Party and Janata Dal (United)-led National Democratic Alliance have a 40 per cent chance of retaining power in the upcoming Bihar election, an opinion poll by C Voter predicted on Friday.According to the poll, Rashtriya Janata Dal-led Mahagathbandhan came a close second with 38.3 per cent chance of forming the government. Meanwhile, the new entrant in Bihar politics, Prashant Kishor's Jan Suraaj, came third in the preference list with 13.3 per cent.The scenario, however, changes when it comes to the preferred choice for chief minister. RJD scion Tejashwi Yadav emerged as the most popular face, securing 36.5% support in the opinion polls.He was followed by Prashant Kishor with 23.2%, incumbent chief minister Nitish Kumar with 15.9%, and Chirag Paswan with 8.8%.When asked who can solve Bihar’s problems, 36.5% of respondents chose the Mahagathbandhan, 12.8% opted for Jan Suraaj, 34.3% preferred the NDA, while 9.4% felt that no one could.Earlier, Tejashwi promised a government job for every household in Bihar and pledged to introduce the legislation within just 20 days of taking office.""NDA government could not provide jobs to the youth in 20 years, but we will bring the Act within 20 days of coming to power and also ensure its implementation within 20 months,"" Tejashwi told reporters at his residence.This comes as parties have geared up for what the Election Commission has called the ""mother of elections.""Seat-sharing talks are in the final stages on all sides. However, constituents of the NDA and the INDIA bloc are grappling with differences over seat-sharing, with smaller allies in both camps jostling for more seats.Prashant Kishor’s Jan Suraaj party declared a list of 51 candidates on Thursday.Amid growing unease in the ruling NDA over the seat sharing, senior BJP leader and Union Minister Dharmendra Pradhan reached Patna on Friday and will hold meetings with senior party leaders.According to news agency PTI, sources in the BJP said that the seat-sharing arrangements within the NDA will be finalized in a day or two, and the party will release its first list of candidates soon after that.The JD(U), another alliance partner of the NDA, is also expected to announce its list of candidates very soon, party sources said.According to sources in the NDA, the allies — JD(U) and BJP — are likely to contest 102 and 101 seats, respectively.Union minister Chirag Paswan’s Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas), which had earlier settled for around 20–22 seats, is now asking for 45 segments, they said.In the opposition bloc, sources said the RJD is likely to contest 135–140 seats.The party has offered the Congress 50–52 seats, lower than the party’s demand for 70 assembly segments.Sources in the RJD said a meeting of senior party leaders will take place in Patna later in the day to finalize the list of its candidates.In the 2020 assembly polls, the Congress had fought 70 seats but won only 19.The other big constituent of the INDIA bloc, the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Liberation, also appeared unhappy with the reportedly 20–25 seats being offered to it.The Election Commission has announced the schedule for the Bihar Assembly elections. The 243 Assembly seats will go to the polls in two phases on November 6 and November 11, with the counting of votes scheduled to take place on November 14.The total number of electors in the final list stands at 7.42 crore, while there were 7.89 crore electors as of June 24 this year. An Election Commission press release stated that 65 lakh voters were removed from the draft list, and the number of electors in the draft list as of August 1, 2025, stood at 7.24 crore.In the 2020 assembly election, BJP contested 110 seats and won 74, securing 19.8% of the vote share with a strike rate of 43.2%. The Janata Dal (United) contested 115 seats and won 43, with a 15.7% vote share and a 33.5% strike rate. The Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) contested 7 seats, winning 4, achieving 0.9% of the vote share and a 32.9% strike rate.","BJP, Janata Dal-led Mahagathbandhan have 40% chance of retaining power.

Taliban seek opening of India-Pak border for trade with India; government to accept Taliban diplomats,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-stand-on-recognising-kabul-regime-will-be-aligned-with-international-communitys/articleshow/124465388.cms,"Taliban foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi

Afghanistan foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi backed trade through the Chabahar port route and called for opening the India-Pakistan Attari-Wagah border for trade with India. At a press conference in the Afghanistan embassy, following his meeting with external affairs minister S Jaishankar, Muttaqi also announced that the Taliban will appoint diplomats in India.Pakistan does not allow India to export to Afghanistan via the land route, and the Indian government has used the Chabahar port in Iran for trade and commerce with Afghanistan. The US, however, last month revoked the 2018 sanctions waiver that allowed India to develop the port and access Afghanistan and Central Asia, bypassing Pakistan.Muttaqi said trade is meant to benefit people and should not be mixed with politics. “Pakistan and India should open the Wagah border to facilitate trade between Afghanistan and India. It will benefit the people of all 3 countries,’’ said Muttaqi, addressing a press conference at the Afghanistan embassy for which no woman journalist was invited. He also announced the formation of a trade committee to remove obstacles in commercial ties with India.Muttaqi also reiterated Afghanistan’s position that it won’t allow the US to take control of the Bagram airbase, even as it remains open to diplomatic ties with Washington. Indian government sources later confirmed India had agreed to work with the Taliban to have their diplomats stationed here but added India’s position on formal recognition will remain broadly aligned with that of the international community.Muttaqi addressed the media with a small flag of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (IEA), Taliban’s name for the country, placed on the table. He told reporters the embassy building, which still flies the flag of the erstwhile Islamic Republic, belonged to the IEA. “The appointment of diplomats will be a step towards normalisation and further improvement of ties,” said Muttaqi. The appointment will not be at the ambassador level, in the absence of formal recognition by India. The diplomats appointed by the Taliban will be allowed to work from the embassy.Asked about women’s rights, a sticking point in the Taliban’s ties with the international community, Muttaqi said all countries have their own customs and traditions and these should be respected. He was also non-committal on whether girls or women would be allowed to travel to India for studies.""In the recent earthquake in Afghanistan, India was the first responder. Afghanistan looks at India as a close friend. Afghanistan wants relations based on mutual respect, trade and people-to-people relations. We are ready to create a consultative mechanism of understanding, which helps towards strengthening our relations,” said Muttaqi.The issue of women rights has been flagged by Indian authorities from several multilateral forums. India believes Taliban must work towards the formation of a truly inclusive government and preservation of women, children and minorities.Muttaqi also said he and Jaishankar discussed security concerns in detail. “The IEA has proven in the last four years that the territory of Afghanistan will not be used against others. And it remains committed to that policy that the territory of Afghanistan is not used to threaten others,” said Muttaqi.","Afghanistan foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi called for opening the India- Pakistan Attari-Wagah border for trade with India.

Centre in Supreme Court: In talks with J&K government on statehood restoration,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/centre-in-supreme-court-in-talks-with-jk-government-on-statehood-restoration/articleshow/124465249.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Centre on Friday informed Supreme Court that it is in consultation with the elected government of J&K - which was divided into UTs of J&K and Ladakh alongside scrapping of the contentious Article 370 on Aug 5, 2019 - on the issue of restoration of statehood without disturbing the UT status of Ladakh.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta told a bench of Chief Justice of India B R Gavai and Justice K Vinod Chandran that elections were held peacefully in the UT and an elected government is in place. However, restoration of statehood is under consideration of the Union government, which is consulting the UT government. ""The Centre will respond to the pleas for restoration of statehood to J&K in four weeks,"" he said.SC adjourned hearing on a bunch of pleas, including those filed by lecturer Zahoor Ahmed Bhat, sitting MLA Irfan Hafiz Lone, Prem Shankar Jha and Radha Kumar, who was one of the three interlocutors for J&K appointed by the UPA government's Cabinet Committee on Security in 2010.Senior advocates Gopal Sankaranarayanan, appearing for Bhat, said SC while upholding the scrapping of Article 370 had not adjudicated the constitutional validity of stripping J&K of its statehood on the promise of ""their government that it would be restored soon after elections were held to the J&K assembly."" Elections were held more than a year ago and still there is no sign of restoring statehood, which is in breach of the undertaking given by Mehta to the court.He said if the bench finds it appropriate, the issue can be referred to a five-judge bench.Mehta protested loudly at the use of ""their govt"" jibe by Sankaranarayanan and said it is ""our govt"", as much mine as theirs and every Indian's. The use of ""their govt"" shows the petitioner's mindset, he said, adding that there are several considerations, including cross-border terrorism and incidents like the Pahalgam terrorist attack, which must be considered before deciding on restoration of statehood.Senior advocate Menaka Guruswamy told SC that stripping a state of its statehood has serious consequences for federalism and informed the court that the J&K cabinet passed a resolution on Oct 18 last year advising the Lt Governor to take steps for restoration of statehood. Senior advocate Dinesh Dwivedi said the Centre has the power to dissolve a state government using powers under Article 356 to retain control but it cannot take away statehood.Another counsel appearing for Radha Kumar alleged that there has been a steep rise in suicides and unemployment in J&K after it was reduced to UT and cited a report by a team led by former judge A P Shah. Mehta said these are the people who are using SC as a forum to peddle lies to defame India in the international forum.""There has been substantial all-round development in the state and 99% of the people of J&K treat the Centre as their govt. There are certain events that have taken place, including the killing of innocent tourists by Pakistan-backed terrorists and these must be taken into consideration during a holistic review of situations to ensure national security prior to restoration of statehood,"" he said.",The Centre informed Supreme Court that it is in consultation with the elected government of J&K.

Delhi-bound AI Dreamliner diverts to Dubai; FIP seeks checks on B787s,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-bound-ai-dreamliner-diverts-to-dubai-fip-seeks-checks-on-b787s/articleshow/124457146.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: In another technical issue with one of its Dreamliners, an Air India Boeing 787 (VT-ANC) operating from Vienna to Delhi on Thursday night diverted to Dubai following a technical snag. The same aircraft subsequently took off for Delhi after its auto pilot as reset and landed at IGI Airport around noon on Friday.While AI maintains there was no safety issue with the aircraft, this is was the second instance within a week with its Dreamliners. Last Saturday (Oct 4) the ram air turbine (RAT) of an AI Dreamliner had deployed on its final approach to Birmingham. The Federation of Indian Pilots (FIP) on Friday asked the aviation ministry and the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) to “ground all B787s in light of continuous electrical problems” and also order a “special audit of AI aircraft maintenance. ” AI maintains its Boeing 787s were found to be perfectly safe to fly after each one of them was checked extensively after AI 171 crash.An AI spokesperson said the Vienna-Delhi flight was diverted due to a technical issue. “The aircraft landed safely at Dubai and underwent necessary checks. All passengers were kept informed of the delay, provided refreshments and the flight, operated by the same aircraft, departed Dubai at 8.45 am (IST) and landed in Delhi at 12.19 pm (IST).At Air India, the safety of passengers and crew remain top priority…. there was (no) electrical failure in the said aircraft. ”The DGCA is probing last Saturday’s RAT deployment. The Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) is probing the June 12 AI 171 crash of an AI Dreamliner.The FIP said in its Friday mail to govt: “Since June 16, we have reiterated that all B-787s in the country must be checked thoroughly for electrical systems. On Oct 4, RAT deployed on AI-117 while on approach to Birmingham. On October 9, AI 154 Vienna to Delhi diverted to Dubai which had major technical issues where the autopilot system suddenly failed triggering a series of technical malfunctions. The aircraft experienced failures across critical systems which included Autopilots, instrument landing system and flight control system degradation with no autoland capability. ”“The pilots could not engage the autopilots due electrical malfunctions; thus, pilots were constrained to fly manually at night and divert to Dubai. Moreover, the FD's were not available with degraded flight control systems. The aircraft landed safely at Dubai. We compliment the skill of the pilots to fly the aircraft at night safely to Dubai with limited automation/systems Two incidents of electrical malfunctions in a short span of time are indicators of poor serviceability by AI,” FIP added.Regarding last Saturday’s RAT deployment, Air India said in: “On Oct 4, 2025, the operating crew of flight AI117 from Amritsar to Birmingham, detected the deployment of RAT of the aircraft during its final approach. The crew had found all electrical and hydraulic parameters to be normal, and the aircraft landed safely at Birmingham Airport. At no point during the flight was there any loss of power or control systems. The aircraft was subsequently grounded for further inspections. Based on the conclusions from our preliminary investigations, the deployment of the RAT was neither due to a system fault nor pilot action.”“The deployment of the RAT was ‘uncommanded’, consistent with similar occurrences with other airlines in the past, as reported by Boeing. Air India had notified the Indian aviation regulator, DGCA, about the occurrence and has submitted the preliminary report to the regulator in accordance with the prescribed guidelines. The aircraft was subsequently cleared for service, and it operated from Birmingham to Delhi on 5 October. At Air India, the safety of all passengers and crew remains our foremost priority,” AI statement added.",An Air India Boeing 787 operating from Vienna to Delhi on Thursday night diverted to Dubai following a technical snag.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court appears set to allow the sale and bursting of green firecrackers in Delhi and National Capital Region for Diwali , Gurupurav and Christmas celebrations.While reserving orders on multiple pleas of firecracker manufacturers for allowing manufacture and sale of green crackers, which was supported by Centre and Haryana government, a bench of Chief Justice B R Gavai and Justice K Vinod Chandran said Friday it will pass a detailed order on Monday permitting manufacture and sale of only green crackers, which conform to standards set by NEERI and PESO.""Did the levels of pollution in 2018 (when the SC had permitted bursting of green crackers within the stipulated time window in the evening) worsen as compared to 2024 to warrant imposing a complete ban?"" the bench asked.

NEW DELHI: Union home minister Amit Shah on Friday backed the Election Commission’s SIR, and said Hindus from Pakistan and Bangladesh have rights on Indian soil while distinguishing refugees from infiltrators.“I want to ask all citizens, who should decide who becomes the prime minister or chief minister? Should anyone other than the citizens of the country have the right to decide this?” Shah asked at an event in New Delhi, reported news agency PTI.Shah said that Hindus in Pakistan were promised refuge in India under the Nehru-Liaquat Pact after partition, but the successive governments failed to honour that promise, which was finally fulfilled by the Modi government through the Citizenship Amendment Act.“Just as much right I have on the soil of this country, that much right the Hindus of Pakistan-Bangladesh have on this soil. I say this as the home minister of the country,” he said.Shah further explained that refugees come to India to save their religion, while infiltrators cross over illegally for economic reasons.“Those who have not faced religious persecution and want to come illegally for economic or other reasons are infiltrators.If anyone in the world who wants to come here is allowed, our country will become a dharamshala,” he said.The home minister also said no one should interfere with the SIR process, adding that such exercises were also held when the Congress was in power.“The opposition is opposing it because their vote banks are getting cut. It is the Election Commission’s Constitutional responsibility to clean the voters’ list. If you have any issues, you can go to court,” he said.Citing Census data, Shah said the Hindu population fell from 84% in 1951 to 79% in 2011, while the Muslim population rose from 9.8% to 14.2%.“According to the 2011 Census, the growth rate of Muslims was 24.6% and that of Hindus 16.8%. This is not because of fertility but due to infiltration,” he remarked.","Union home minister Amit Shah said Hindus from Pakistan and Bangladesh have rights on Indian soil.

NEW DELHI: India's all traditionally high-emission industries, including aluminum, cement and pulp & paper, will have to reduce the intensity of their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to meet specific targets by 2026-27 compared to a 2023-24 baseline as the govt has notified rules for the country's first legally binding emission reduction target for carbon-heavy industries.The rules, notified by the environment ministry on Oct 8, make it mandatory for 282 industrial units to reduce GHG emissions per unit of product (emission intensity) beginning 2025-26.These industrial units, spread across the country, will be liable to pay a penalty for non-compliance. The rules are notified under the compliance mechanism of the Carbon Credit Trading Scheme (CCTS), 2023.The highest number of industrial units (186) which will have to reduce GHG emission intensity (GEI) within a specified time-period belong to the cement sector, followed by pulp & paper (53), plants that use chlor-alkali process to extract certain chemicals (30), and aluminium plants (13).GEI targets (in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent) for the year 2025-26 have been calculated based on the pro-rata basis for the remaining months of the current financial year. The overall reduction till 2026-27 ranges from about 3.4% in the cement sector to about 5.8% in aluminium, 7.5% in chlor-alkali and 7.1% in pulp and paper, compared to the 2023-24 levels.In case an industrial unit fails to comply with the GEI target or fails to submit the carbon credit certificates equivalent to the shortfall for compliance, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) will impose 'environmental compensation' (penalty) for the shortfall.The penalty will be equal to twice of the average price at which the carbon credit certificate is traded during the trading cycle of that compliance year. It'll be paid within the 90 days from the day of the imposition order.According to the notification, the fund collected under the 'environmental compensation' will be maintained in a separate account and utilised for the purposes of the CCTS on the recommendation of the national steering committee for the Indian carbon market.The GEI targets are in sync with India's 'net zero' emission goal of 2070 and will contribute to meet its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDCs) - climate action targets - through the reduction or removal or avoidance of GHG emissions.","India's traditionally high-emission industries, including aluminum, cement and pulp & paper, will have to reduce the intensity of their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to meet specific targets by 2026-27.

Ranganathan has been arrested over the deaths, 20 of them in Chhindwara alone, after allegedly consuming toxic cough syrup, Coldrif, manufactured by his company.By the time the court in Chhindwara's Parasia remanded Ranganathan in 10-day police custody in the evening, he had faced hours of mob fury.In Parasia, an SIT formed to probe the deaths told court that Ranganathan's remand was essential to interrogate him about Coldrif's supply chain. Granting remand till Oct 20, the court cited security concerns and directed that Ranganathan be kept in Chhindwara district jail during questioning.Ranganathan chose to defend himself as lawyers in Parasia decided not to represent him. He told the court he was hypertensive, diabetic and claimed his company supplied medicines to five states but only MP reported adverse effects.Ranganathan has been charged with offences that include culpable homicide and drug contamination, along with sections under Drugs and Cosmetics Act.

NEW DELHI: In a surprise move, Arvind Kejriwal 's Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has announced that it will contest all 243 seats in the upcoming Bihar assembly elections, positioning itself as an alternative to both the ruling NDA and the opposition Mahagathbandhan. The decision has added an interesting variable as strategist-turned-politician Prashant Kishor ’s Jan Suraaj also debuts this time in what the Election Commission has called the ""mother of elections.""Party leaders said AAP aims to introduce its ""Delhi-Punjab model"" of governance in Bihar, focusing on education, healthcare and anti-corruption measures. The leadership believes widespread public frustration with unemployment, migration and poor infrastructure has created space for a new brand of issue-based politics in the state.""We have an approved model of growth and governance. The work done by the Aam Aadmi Party is being discussed across the country. People hailing from the Purvanchal region had contributed immensely to our victory in Delhi,"" AAP's state in-charge Ajesh Yadav said while announcing the decision.""Our national convener Arvind Kejriwal asked if they can help us form a government in Delhi, then why not in Bihar?"" he added.AAP’s move comes at a time when the opposition bloc - RJD, Congress, and Left parties - is struggling to finalise a seat-sharing formula ahead of the polls. The AAP, which earlier announced its decision to part ways from INDIA bloc in July, shortly after Delhi election debacle, has again chosen to chart an independent course in Bihar.Kejriwal's move is being widely seen as a response to the rise of Prashant Kishor, who has visited almost every corner of Bihar with an aim of grassroot expansion in the last couple of years. Prashant Kishor is promising an alternative to the traditional contest between the BJP-JD(U) and RJD-Congress that heavily depends on caste politics.AAP MP Sanjay Singh explained this: ""We have already delivered on the ground, but Prashant Kishore is making promises only. Making promises and actually implementing them on the ground are two very different things,"" Singh said.Interestingly, Prashant Kishor, as a strategist, played a pivotal role in AAP's success, especially in Delhi.

It's a formula that once worked for Kejriwal in Delhi where AAP dethroned Congress mired in corruption and anti-incumbency.The same story was repeated in Punjab where AAP defeated the two traditional parties of Congress and Shiromani Akali Dal that had ruled the state for seven decades. AAP was seen as a party offering a fresh, corruption-free alternative, building on its reputation for delivering welfare policies and good governance in Delhi.In Bihar, Kishor has been attempting a similar style of politics, and now Kejriwal’s party has entered the fray, vying for the same space. But will Kejriwal's party succeed in making inroads in a state like Bihar or will it just vanish in thin air?

"Ahead of Delhi meet, Taliban seek India’s recognition for Islamic Emirate",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ahead-of-delhi-meet-taliban-seek-indias-recognition-for-islamic-emirate/articleshow/124434189.cms,"External affairs minister S Jaishankar, left, and Afghanistan foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi

Taliban Seeks India’s Recognition For Islamic Emirate Ahead Of Muttaqi-Jaishankar Talks in Delhi

Poll Should India consider granting formal recognition to the Taliban government? Yes, it can boost bilateral ties No, caution is necessary

The Taliban are seeking an upgrade of their relationship with India in the form of diplomatic recognition, as the Afghanistan foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi meets external affairs minister S Jaishankar on Friday. Muttaqi arrived in Delhi Thursday for a 6-day visit that is expected to boost India’s fast growing economic ties and people-to-people contacts with Kabul, even without a formal recognition for the regime in Kabul.On the eve of Muttaqi’s meeting with Jaishankar here, a top Taliban leader told TOI it’s time for both governments to elevate the relationship by granting recognition to the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (IEA), the name used by the Taliban for the country.“It is the first high level visit by our foreign minister to India and is very significant. We expect it will initiate a new phase of relations between the two countries. There are a lot of areas which can be explored for mutual cooperation during this visit,” said the head of Taliban’s political office and Afghanistan’s ambassador to Qatar Suhail Shaheen.“I think it is time for leadership of both countries to raise the diplomatic level by granting recognition to IEA government and thus paving the way for bilateral cooperation and expansion of relations in various fields,” added Shaheen.The UN Security Council earlier waived a travel ban on Muttaqi to allow him to travel to India. That India was keen to host Muttaqi is a sign of growing trust in the relationship as the Taliban urge India to expand its economic footprint in the country. The visit also helps India further capitalise on the dramatic deterioration in the Taliban’s ties with Pakistan, which accuses Kabul of funding and arming the Pakistan Taliban or Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).Recognition for the Taliban, however, remains a tricky issue for India as the Indian government wants its position to be in consonance with that of the international community. That position is unlikely to change with Muttaqi’s visit. As multiple sources here told TOI, the visit is only indicative of an enhancement in bilateral relations and diplomatic engagements.As the government has said in the past, India seeks a sovereign, democratic and peaceful Afghanistan, where the interests of all sections of Afghan society including women, children and minorities are protected. Additionally, despite credible assurances by Kabul that it won’t allow Afghanistan to be used against India, the Indian government still has concerns about links between Pakistan-based terror groups and forces in Afghanistan. While several countries have accepted Taliban-appointed officials as diplomats, Russia remains the only country to have formally recognised the government in Kabul.This lack of recognition is unlikely to come in the way of India’s efforts to ramp up its ties with the Taliban as it maintains its ties are guided by historical relations and friendship with the people of Afghanistan. While India already has projects across the 34 provinces of the country, it has also committed to engaging in more development projects soon, while continuing with its ongoing humanitarian assistance programme, buoyed by the support it has received from the Taliban.Apart from Delhi, Muttaqi is also likely to travel to Agra and Deoband. He was earlier also planning to travel to Mumbai and Hyderabad but that has now been cancelled.",Amir Khan Muttaqi arrived in Delhi Thursday for a 6-day visit that is expected to boost India’s fast growing economic ties and people-to-people contacts with Kabul.

Asylum ineligibility rules



Asylum claims made more than one year after someone first arrived in Canada, after June 14, 2020, would not be referred to the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada. This would apply to anyone, including students and temporary residents, regardless of whether they left the country and returned.

Asylum claims from people who enter Canada along the US land border between ports of entry and who make a claim after 14 days would also not be considered.

If someone enters irregularly (e.g., through the U.S. border or without valid documentation), it will become harder to claim asylum.

Claimants who already have status or applications in another safe country (like the U.S.) might now be automatically ineligible.

Refugee claims will be processed faster but with stricter screening. This can reduce waiting times, but may also lead to more refusals if the evidence is weak.

Finland, regularly recognised as the world’s happiest country in the World Happiness Report, attracts global talent thanks to its outstanding quality of life, robust social welfare system, and stunning natural landscapes. For Indian citizens, obtaining permanent residency (PR) in this Nordic nation provides full rights to live and work, options for family reunification, and a route to citizenship. Recent 2025 immigration updates have simplified the process for non-EU skilled professionals, positioning Finland as an appealing destination amid labour shortages in sectors like IT, healthcare, and engineering.Finland’s permanent residency offers non-EU nationals — including Indians — the right to live and work in the country indefinitely, along with access to essential public services such as healthcare and education. It also provides the freedom to travel freely within the Schengen Area. Unlike temporary residence permits, permanent residency does not expire, though the residence card itself must be renewed every five years within the specified timeframe. However, this status should not be confused with Finnish citizenship, which comes with stricter requirements — including proof of language proficiency and a longer period of continuous residence, typically eight years.The 2025 immigration updates focus primarily on The 2025 immigration updates focus primarily on work visas and family reunification, rather than directly on permanent residency. Under the new rules, family sponsors must have lived in the country for a minimum of two years, and spouses are required to be at least 21 years old. At the same time, work permits have been simplified for specialists, with fast-track processing available for high-salary positions, which now require a monthly gross income of EUR 1,600 (around INR 1.65 lakh).To qualify, you must have continuously lived in Finland for four years under a Type A (continuous) residence permit, beginning either from your arrival in the country or from when the permit was issued. Time spent on Type B (temporary) permits for short-term work does not count toward this period. Additionally, you must have been physically present in Finland for at least two of these four years, with all absences for holidays or work abroad properly documented.The basis for your temporary permit, like employment, family ties, must still hold, for you to apply for a PR. Permanent Residence is not available to students or those on job-seeker permits. Before submitting a PR application, you must first transition to a Type A work or family-based permit.Although permanent residency doesn’t directly mandate these, obtaining the initial Type A permit typically requires financial and professional stability. For employment-based applications, candidates must either earn at least EUR 40,000 annually (around INR 41.3 lakh) or hold a recognised master’s/postgraduate degree with a minimum of two years of relevant experience. Alternatively, demonstrating C1-level proficiency in Finnish or Swedish along with three years of work experience can also strengthen eligibility.Applicants must provide a clean criminal record (police clearance from India), valid health insurance, and proof of accommodation. They should have no outstanding debts or dependence on social welfare. Any criminal history may negatively impact the approval process.Indians typically start with a temporary residence permit application from India, then apply for PR after four years while in Finland. Processing can take a long time so be flexible with your plans.Secure a job offer, university admission, or family tie. Apply online via Enter Finland or at VFS Global centres in India. Submit biometrics and documents like passport, job contract, salary proof, apostilled certificates, and police clearance.Live in Finland on your Type A permit, extending as required.Gather passport, photos, proof of residence, income/salary slips, educational certificates, trip logs (absences), and family details if applicable.Apply in Finland before your current permit expires. Use Enter Finland with Finnish ID for faster processing.Prove identity at a Migri service point Check status via Migri's Processing Time Checker. If approved, collect your biometric PR card.Rejections (e.g., due to incomplete docs) can be appealed within 30 days for a fee of approximately EUR 260. .For unemployed permit holders, a three-month grace period applies to find new work.Here are some benefits and considerations for Indians: Indians have the perks of indefinite stay, family sponsorship, Schengen travel, free education/healthcare, and a path to citizenship after eight years (with language tests). However there are some challenges that come with this. Some of the challenges are cold climate, language barriers (Finnish/Swedish), high living costs overall, which require proper preparation and adaptability for a smooth transition to life in Finland, ensuring long-term comfort and success.Also See: Sweden becomes the first country to be prescribed by doctors: Inside “The Swedish Prescription” campaign","Finland’s permanent residency offers non-EU nationals — including Indians — the right to live and work in the country indefinitely.

The app has now received attention from Mahindra Group chairman Anand Mahindra . Recently, Mahindra took to social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) to reveal that he has downloaded the Arattai app, prompting a response from Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu.

Google expands AI infrastructure and data centres

Strengthening Belgium’s digital future

AI’s potential for economic growth





US tech giant Google has announced plans to invest €5 billion ($5.8 billion) in Belgium to expand its AI infrastructure and data centre network, creating hundreds of new jobs and supporting local economic growth. The investment will focus on the company’s existing Saint-Ghislain site and the new Farciennes campus, with construction already underway. Google said the expansion will strengthen Belgium’s role in Europe’s cloud and AI sector, provide large-scale computing capacity powered by carbon-free energy, and create opportunities for local suppliers and contractors. Officials highlighted the move as a vote of confidence in Belgium’s tech ecosystem and workforce.The investment will modernise and expand Google’s network of data centres in Saint-Ghislain and Farciennes, enabling the company to handle large volumes of digital data and support advanced AI systems. These facilities are designed to operate entirely on clean energy, aligning with Google’s global goal to achieve carbon-free operations by 2030. The expansion will also support the development of new onshore wind farms in Belgium to power the centres sustainably.The project is expected to create around 300 new full-time jobs directly, while indirectly supporting approximately 15,000 additional roles through local contractors and partners. Google already works with about 150 Belgian suppliers, including 80 in Wallonia, and the expansion will further boost construction, technology, and service sector employment. Prime Minister Bart De Wever emphasized that the investment underscores Belgium’s growing importance as a digital and green technology hub.Belgium has become a key location for technology growth thanks to its reliable internet networks, stable power supply, and skilled workforce. Google Cloud already serves Belgian companies and organizations such as Odoo and UZ Leuven, helping them scale AI-based tools for healthcare, research, and business. The new investment will enhance Belgium’s competitiveness in the European cloud and AI market, attracting further international investment and innovation.A 2024 study commissioned by Google estimated that artificial intelligence could increase Belgium’s GDP by €45 to €50 billion over the next decade. Most jobs are expected to be supported or improved by AI, with only a small portion at risk of automation. By expanding AI infrastructure, Google aims to equip Belgian companies and the workforce with advanced digital tools while fostering sustainable and inclusive growth. The investment positions Belgium as a hub for next-generation AI innovation in Europe. It also signals Google’s commitment to combining technological advancement with environmental responsibility, shaping the future of digital and green growth.","Google plans to invest €5 billion ($5.8 billion) in Belgium to expand its AI infrastructure and data centre network.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Who is Letitia James?: New York Attorney General indicted months after defeating Trump in court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/i-am-fearless-new-york-attorney-general-indicted-months-after-defeating-trump-in-court-who-is-letitia-james/articleshow/124441546.cms,"FILE - New York Attorney General Letitia James (AP Photo/Bebeto Matthews, File)

'Democracy Under Siege': Ex-US Official Slams Trump's 'Enemy Within' Barb, Crackdown On Dissent

Who is Letitia James?







New York Attorney General Letitia James, who was indicted on charges of bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution, said that she is a ""fearless"" person.Calling the charges of bank fraud ""baseless,"" James referred to a civil fraud lawsuit she successfully filed against President Donald Trump and his company for alleged fraudulent business practices, which resulted in a fine of approximately $465 million being overturned by an appeals court in August.The statement also mentioned the resignation of US Attorney Erik Siebert, who departed his position after President Trump criticised him for not bringing charges against James and former FBI Director James Comey. Comey was indicted last month following the appointment of US Attorney Lindsey Halligan, Axios reported.James said, ""This is nothing more than a continuation of the president's desperate weaponization of our justice system. He is forcing federal law enforcement agencies to do his bidding, all because I did my job as the New York State Attorney General."" She continued, ""These charges are baseless, and the president's own public statements make clear that his only goal is political retribution at any cost. The president's actions are a grave violation of our Constitutional order and have drawn sharp criticism from members of both parties.Regarding Siebert, James said, ""His decision to fire a United States Attorney who refused to bring charges against me—and replace them with someone who is blindly loyal not to the law, but to the president—is antithetical to the bedrock principles of our country."" She added, ""This is the time for leaders on both sides of the aisle to speak out against this blatant perversion of our system of justice.""The Attorney General concluded, ""I stand strongly behind my office's litigation against the Trump Organization. We conducted a two-year investigation based on the facts and evidence—not politics. Judges have upheld the trial court's finding that Donald Trump, his company, and his two sons are liable for fraud.""""I am a proud woman of faith, and I know that faith and fear cannot share the same space. And so today I am not fearful, I am fearless, and as my faith teaches me, no weapon formed against me shall prosper. We will fight these baseless charges aggressively, and my office will continue to fiercely protect New Yorkers and their rights. And I will continue to do my job.""In response, Halligan stated, ""No one is above the law. The charges as alleged in this case represent intentional, criminal acts and tremendous breaches of the public's trust. The facts and the law in this case are clear.""Letitia “Tish” James is the 67th Attorney General for the state of New York. Elected in 2018, she became the first woman of colour to hold statewide office in New York and the first woman to be elected Attorney General. James brings decades of experience and a strong record of achievements to her role as a powerful and effective attorney.Prior to her current position, she was the public advocate for the City of New York. Elected in 2013, she became the first woman of colour to hold citywide office. During her tenure, her office passed more legislation than all previous public advocates combined, including a groundbreaking law that banned questions about salary history from the employment process to address the pervasive gender wage gap.Before serving as public advocate, James represented the 35th Council District in Brooklyn in the New York City Council for ten years. As a council member, she passed the Safe Housing Act, legislation that required landlords to improve living conditions for tenants in New York City’s worst buildings.Prior to her election to the City Council, James was head of the Brooklyn Regional Office of the New York State Attorney General’s Office. James began her career as a public defender at the Legal Aid Society. A proud Brooklynite, she is a graduate of Lehman College and Howard University School of Law.","New York Attorney General Letitia James was indicted on charges of bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution.

Yes, increased vigilance is needed No, current measures are sufficient

What it means for India?







After suffering major losses at home -- Muridke terror camp - during Operation Sindoor , Hafiz Saeed-led Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) has reportedly formed a covert alliance with Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP), the South Asian wing of ISIS, allegedly engineered and funded by Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI).Reports indicate the alliance aims to target Baloch people, with possible expansion to Jammu and Kashmir.A circulated video on social media shows LeT commander Rana Muhammad Ishfaq training with ISKP’s Shafiq Mengal at an undisclosed location in Balochistan.A recently surfaced photograph shows ISKP’s coordinator in Balochistan, Mir Shafiq Mengal, handing a pistol to Rana Muhammad Ashfaq, a senior LeT commander -- a symbolic gesture signalling formal coordination between the two groups under ISI patronage.Mir Shafiq Mengal has helped establish ISKP bases in Mastung and Khuzdar and reportedly led death squads against separatists. LeT’s longstanding presence in Quetta has facilitated the growing closeness between the groups.Meanwhile, this covert alliance between the two terror groups could raise serious concerns for India, as it is reportedly aimed at expanding operations in the Kashmir region, raising major security concerns.Intelligence sources say the goal is evident: to crush the Baloch insurgency, strengthen Pakistan’s control over Afghanistan’s unstable border regions, and restart terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir while maintaining plausible deniability.Observers note a worrying shift in ISKP’s propaganda magazine 'Yalgaar', which signals an expressed intent to extend operations into the Kashmir Valley, apparently coordinated and supported by Pakistan’s deep state.Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) has a long history of terror attacks on Indian soil, including 26/11 Mumbai attacks.Arun Gupta, director of VIF and former deputy NSA, said, “Pakistan is a master in proxy wars, using terrorist groups to fight insurgencies, but unintended consequences are inevitable. India must remain vigilant.”This alliance comes after India’s strong counterterror actions under Operation Sindoor, which the PM Modi-led government says is ongoing but currently paused. India had destroyed LeT’s den and headquarters in Muridke in mainland Pakistan.After the Muridke camp was destroyed by the IAF, reports have emerged that LeT is shifting to a safer location near the Afghanistan border, with Pakistan aiding its reconstruction.","Hafiz Saeed-led Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) has reportedly formed a covert alliance with Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP) ISKP is the South Asian wing of ISIS, allegedly engineered and funded by Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) The alliance aims to target Baloch people, with possible expansion to Jammu and Kashmir.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124380304,imgsize-946149,width-400,resizemode-4/ians-photo.jpg"

Focus on trade and investment





NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi and his visiting counterpart Keir Starmer discussed initiatives to double down on likely gains from the India-UK landmark trade deal in a bilateral meeting, while also focusing on efforts to deepen their cooperation in the Indo-Pacific and in areas like technology, defence co-production and security.Modi also raised the issue of anti-India activities by Khalistan separatists. While the PM himself did not bring up the issue in his media remarks after the meeting, foreign secretary Vikram Misri said later that the PM emphasised radicalism and violent extremism had no space in democratic societies and “in particular should not be allowed to use the freedoms or abuse the freedoms provided by democratic societies”. It is understood that the issue of extradition of Indian economic figities was also discussed.He also said that the PM underlined the need to move against them within the legal frameworks that are available to both sides.Modi, who announced an agreement for cooperation in military training under which IAF flying instructors will serve as trainers with the UK’s Royal Air Force, said India and the UK are natural partners as their relationship is built on the shared values of democracy, freedom, and the rule of law.“In today’s time of global uncertainty, our growing partnership stands as an important pillar of global stability and economic progress,” said Modi in a joint press statement with Starmer after their meeting.Defence, in fact, was a major focus area in the meeting with the leaders endorsing an Intent to finalize an Inter-Governmental Agreement (IGA) on cooperation in developing maritime electric propulsion systems for Indian Naval platforms. Another agreement for supply of Lightweight Multirole Missile (LMM) systems to support India’s air defence capabilities was also announced. According to a joint statement, this agreement, in the spirit of Atmanirbhar Bharat, will meet the current and future requirements of the Indian Ministry of Defence, and support a long-term collaboration on complex weapons between the two countries.Both leaders agreed to work closely in promoting reformed multilateralism, including reform of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), as Starmer reiterated UK’s long-standing support for India’s “legitimate aspirations for permanent membership in a reformed UNSC”.Modi and Starmer focused on ramping up cooperation in the Indo-Pacific too as they committed to, according to the joint statement, robust maritime security collaboration in the region, including establishment of the Regional Maritime Security Centre of Excellence (RMSCE) under the Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative (IPOI).Recalling the “historic” Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) that India concluded with the UK in July, Modi said this agreement will reduce import costs between the 2 countries, create new employment opportunities for youth, boost trade, and benefit both Indian and UK industries and consumers.He said there are immense possibilities in the technology partnership, including in critical and emerging technologies, between India and the UK. “We are working to connect the UK’s industrial expertise and R&D with India’s talent and scale. Last year, we launched the India–UK Technology Security Initiative. To connect the youth of both countries through an innovation bridge, we have taken several steps, including establishing the Connectivity and Innovation Centre and the Joint AI Research Centre,” he said.The leaders also announced the setting up of a UK – India Critical Minerals Processing and Downstream Collaboration Guild to build concrete partnerships which “strengthen and diversify critical mineral supply chains and deliver investment and growth in both nations”.“Our defense cooperation has also deepened. We are moving towards defense co-production and connecting the defense industries of both countries. Taking our defense collaboration a step further, we have signed an agreement for cooperation in military training, under which Flying Instructors from the Indian Air Force will serve as trainers with the UK’s Royal Air Force,” he said.Both leaders looked forward to an early ratification of the India–UK CETAThey welcomed the resetting of the Joint Economic and Trade Committee (JETCO) which will support the governance and utilisation of the CETAFocus on construction, infrastructure and clean energy, advanced manufacturing, defence, education, sport, culture, financial and professional business services to realise the benefits of FTABoth Prime Ministers reiterated their commitment to improving connectivity and enhancing cooperation in the aviation sector.","PM Narendra Modi and his visiting counterpart Keir Starmer discussed initiatives to double down on likely gains from the India-UK landmark trade deal.

Layers of Roman life

Anglo-Saxon and medieval insights



A marketplace built over history





Beneath the bustling heart of Leicester, England, archaeologists have unearthed a 2,000-year-old prison hidden under the city’s historic Market Place. What began as a routine excavation for urban redevelopment has turned into one of the most significant discoveries in recent UK archaeology. The dig, led by the University of Leicester Archaeological Services (ULAS), is part of a £7.5 million project by Leicester City Council to create a new market square. The team uncovered the long-lost Gainsborough Chamber—a medieval civic building first recorded in 1533, infamous for its “vile prison.” They also discovered layers of Roman and Anglo-Saxon life, artifacts, and even a Roman infant burial, offering an extraordinary window into centuries of human history lying silently beneath the modern marketplace.At the centre of the discovery is the Gainsborough Chamber, demolished around 1748 but now partially restored in the archaeological record. Historical texts describe it as a “most vile prison,” where harsh conditions likely made it infamous in medieval Leicester. Archaeologists uncovered its thick stone walls, a stone-lined well, and remnants of the dungeon, confirming the building’s architectural and civic importance.According to historian Charles Billson, a prisoner in 1533 described being chained, lying on hard planks, and receiving no comfort or company, highlighting the dungeon’s grim reputation. Gavin Speed, the lead archaeologist, emphasized that this area of Leicester had remained largely untouched until the current excavation, making the discovery even more remarkable.The excavation revealed a wealth of Roman-era remains, including a timber building later replaced by a stone structure. Artifacts such as Roman tesserae, pottery, coins, and jewellery help reconstruct daily life in ancient Leicester. A particularly poignant find was the burial of a Roman infant beneath the timber structure, likely around 1,900 years ago, providing a glimpse into family life and customs from nearly two millennia ago. The later stone building was constructed directly over the earlier timber house, showing how the city evolved over time. These findings underscore Leicester’s long-standing significance as a Roman settlement and trade hub.Beneath the medieval layers, archaeologists uncovered a thick Anglo-Saxon soil layer, shedding light on a little-understood period in Leicester’s history. Compacted pebbles, overlain by silts and successive resurfacing layers, revealed nearly 800 years of continuous market activity. Post-holes from medieval market stalls offer rare physical evidence of the city’s commercial past. Dr. Speed described the site as “like a slice through an archaeological cake,” showing how each layer represents a different generation of market activity and urban life. These discoveries reveal how Leicester’s central square continuously adapted to social and economic changes, blending Roman, Anglo-Saxon, and medieval influences across centuries.The dig confirms Leicester’s role as a historic trade centre, with layers of activity preserved beneath the modern square. The city council plans to repave the market in porphyry by the end of 2026 but hopes to display some of the archaeological finds to the public. Mayor Sir Peter Soulsby highlighted that the expertise of ULAS has revealed how the site has been used for thousands of years, from Roman settlers to Victorian traders. While shoppers walk above, centuries of human history remain hidden just below their feet, from infant burials to bustling medieval markets. This remarkable find reminds us that every step through Leicester’s marketplace is a step across two millennia of living history.","Archaeologists have unearthed a 2,000-year-old prison hidden under the city’s Market Place.
