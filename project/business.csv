Single dose of Covid-19 vaccine sufficient for already infected people: Study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/single-dose-of-covid-19-vaccine-sufficient-for-already-infected-people-study/articleshow/83513073.cms,"HYDERABAD: A single dose of Covid-19 vaccine is sufficient for an infected person as there was a greater antibody response when compared with those who have had no prior infection, according to a study released by AIG Hospitals on Monday.The city-based AIG Hospitals recently published a study conducted on 260 healthcare workers, who got vaccinated between January 16 and February 5, in the International Journal of Infectious Diseases (a peer-reviewed journal).The study was designed to assess the immunological memory response in all those patients.All patients were given the Covishield vaccine.The study also said Memory T-cell responses elicited by a single dose of vaccine were significantly higher in the previously infected group compared with those who had no prior infection.Commenting on the impact that this study can have on the overall vaccine administration strategy, Dr. D Nageshwar Reddy , Chairman, AIG Hospitals, and one of the co-authors of the study, said the results show that people who got infected with Covid-19 need not take two doses of vaccine as a single dose can develop robust antibody and memory cell response at par with two-doses for those who didnt get the infection.This will significantly help at a time when theres a shortage of vaccine in the country and more people can be covered using the saved doses, Dr Reddy said.Once the requisite number of people are vaccinated for achieving herd immunity, these patients who got infected and received only one dose can take the second dose of the vaccine, he further said.At this point, all our strategies should be directed at the widespread distribution of available vaccines and to include the maximum number of people at least with a single dose, Dr Reddy added.",There was a greater antibody response when compared with those who have had no prior infection.

Eyewear retailer Lenskart Solutions has opened its initial public offering (IPO) on Friday, aiming to raise Rs 2,150 crore through a fresh issue of shares, while promoters and existing investors will sell 12.75 crore shares via an offer for sale (OFS).The IPO will remain open till November 4 and the company is set to hit Dalal Street on November 10. Shares will be alloted to investors on November 6.Lenskart plans to utilise proceeds from the fresh issue towards setting up new company-operated, company-owned (CoCo) stores, expenditure on lease and rental agreements for these outlets, and investments in technology, cloud infrastructure, and brand marketing. The company has also earmarked funds for potential inorganic acquisitions and general corporate purposes.It has a price band of Rs 382–Rs 402 per share, and is seeking a valuation of over Rs 69,700 crore on the upper end.The entity’s grey market premium stood at Rs 70 per share, according to ET. This indicates that the company’s shares might list around Rs 472, a premium of 17.41%.SBI Securities has advised investors to “Subscribe for long term”, pointing to Lenskart’s strong business model and its leadership in a market that has major space to grow.The brokerage said listing gains may be limited, but the company’s integrated supply chain, better profitability metrics, and strong brand strength support its long-term growth.Ventura Securities has also given a “Subscribe” recommendation, describing Lenskart as a growth-led business. It cited the company’s technology-focused strategy, AI-driven customer engagement, and a store payback period of under one year, adding that profitability is expected to strengthen as the business expands into additional regions.Nirmal Bang, according to ET, acknowledged that the IPO appears expensive at first, but the valuation holds up when compared with modern retail peers such as Trent and Metro. The brokerage maintained a Subscribe (long-term) stance, referring to Lenskart’s brand strength, premium product mix, and international expansion plans.The company’s market debut follows a strong response in the anchor book. On Thursday, Lenskart garnered bids worth around Rs 68,000 crore from anchor investors, people familiar with the matter told PTI. The bid amount was nearly 10 times the total issue size of Rs 7,278 crore and close to 20 times the Rs 3,268-crore anchor allocation. Ahead of the IPO, SBI Mutual Fund invested Rs 100 crore, while Avenue Supermarts (DMart) founder Radhakishan Damani invested around Rs 90 crore.Founded in 2008, Lenskart began as an online platform in 2010 and opened its first physical store in 2013 in New Delhi. It now operates an omni-channel model, offering prescription eyewear, sunglasses, and contact lenses across metro, tier-1, and tier-2 cities, and has expanded internationally to Southeast Asia and the Middle East.The company designs, manufactures, brands, and retails eyewear through facilities in Bhiwadi and Gurugram, supported by regional hubs in Singapore and the UAE. Lenskart added 847 stores since FY23, taking its network to 2,806 outlets as of June 2025, 2,137 in India and 669 overseas.According to ET, the company’s revenue surged over 32% annually to Rs 6,652.5 crore, while EBITDA rose 93.4% to Rs 971.1 crore, with margins improving to 14.6% in FY25 from 6.9% in FY23. Lenskart posted a net profit of Rs 297.3 crore in FY25, compared to a net loss of Rs 63.8 crore in FY23, though the profit was aided by one-off gains.Lenskart holds an estimated 4–6% market share in India’s eyewear market, but faces competition in a sector that remains 77% unorganised, according to Redseer, placing the company at a combination of a large opportunity and a highly fragmented market. According to Redseer, Lenskart was the largest seller of prescription eyeglasses in India by volume in FY25.","Lenskart Solutions has opened its initial public offering (IPO) on Friday.

NEW DELHI: In a unique move, the road transport ministry has directed the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and highway builders to create their own YouTube channels and upload regular videos of highway projects at various stages of construction.Union minister Nitin Gadkari said he has ordered the installation of hoardings with QR codes on national highways. Commuters will be able to scan these codes to view details of the contractor, consultant, and government officials responsible for the stretch, including their names and contact information.Gadkari said, “Main kyu gaali khaun? The QR code will have information of the contractor, consultant, and officers who cleared the road. If a road is bad and people are complaining about it on social media, take it seriously. From A to Z in road construction, we need ownership, sincerity, and a positive approach. Roads must be good, and they must stay good.”He emphasised that if people are paying toll, they deserve international-quality roads. “Weather or poor bitumen cannot be excuses. If the surface is not comfortable, fix it — cost may increase but comfort is non-negotiable,” Gadkari said.The minister also pushed for performance audits to identify design and maintenance lapses, promote accountability, and reward quality work. “When audits are regular, transparency increases, and excuses decrease. That’s how we should work,” he said.At the same event, road transport secretary V Umashankar on Tuesday instructed NHAI to upload such project videos for public viewing and feedback. Speaking at a CII event, he said, “We often get information and updates about projects and problems from videos uploaded by independent YouTubers. Some comments also give insight into issues. We are working to make video uploading part of project contract documents.”Officials said builders already submit drone-shot videos during construction, so making them public will not be an issue. The move aims to enhance transparency, accountability, and public participation in highway projects.Gadkari said work is underway to upgrade 25,000 km of highways to four lanes and connect major ports under a ₹2 lakh crore plan, highlighting that improved connectivity is also supporting religious tourism and adventure travel. The ministry is making precast technology mandatory in highway construction to enhance quality and speed up completion.Citing the transplantation of 8,500 trees along the Dwarka Expressway, Gadkari said the government is committed to balancing infrastructure growth with environmental sustainability.He added that improved road infrastructure will help reduce logistics and fuel costs, noting that “80% of goods traffic in India moves by road, while 18% uses other modes and only 1% by air. With better highways, logistics costs are expected to come down to single digits.”Reaffirming the government’s commitment, Gadkari said the goal is to build safe, sustainable, and modern roads that boost economic activity and improve the quality of life across India.","The road transport ministry has directed the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and highway builders to create their own YouTube channels.

"India, US ink new defence framework for 10 years; aim to deepen cooperation in all domains",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-us-ink-new-defence-framework-for-10-years-aim-to-deepen-cooperation-in-all-domains/articleshow/125007676.cms,"Rajnath Singh, Pete Hegseth Sign 10-Year India-US Defence Pact To Strengthen Indo-Pacific Security

Defence to remain major pillar of relations with US: Rajnath





India and the US inked on Friday an expansive new defence framework to strengthen their strategic partnership over the next 10 years. This comes amid indications that a trade deal is also in the works to douse the raging tariff tensions between the two countries.The 'Framework for the US-India Major Defence Partnership', inked during a meeting between defence minister Rajnath Singh and his American counterpart Pete Hegseth on the sidelines of the Asean meet in Kuala Lumpur, supplants and builds on the one inked in June 2015.The 2025 framework aims to further transform the defence partnership by providing ""a unified vision and policy direction"" to deepen cooperation in all domains, including defence-industrial collaboration, military interoperability across land, air, sea, space and cyberspace, as well as maritime domain awareness, over the next 10 years.Officials told TOI that the intent is to ""recalibrate"" the partnership in line with ""a renewed consensus to effectively address the emerging security challenges and priorities in the region, including imperatives for deterrence, stability and safeguarding a free and open Indo-Pacific"".Defence and military cooperation over the last two decades has been the cornerstone of the overall bilateral ties, which have taken a major hit since President Donald Trump imposed 50% tariffs on New Delhi earlier this year and due to his continuing insistence that he had brokered the ceasefire between India and Pakistan by leveraging trade deals.The upward trajectory of the defence ties, however, was evident at the Singh-Hegseth meeting. ""The framework will usher in a new era in our already strong defence partnership. It is a signal of our growing strategic convergence and will herald a new decade of partnership. Defence will remain the major pillar of our bilateral relations,"" Singh said.Hegseth, in turn, said, ""The framework advances our defence partnership, a cornerstone for regional stability and deterrence. We're enhancing our coordination, information-sharing and tech cooperation. Our defence ties have never been stronger.""India, of course, remains concerned about the signalling by the Trump administration that its Indo-Pacific strategy to counter an aggressive China is no longer a top priority, even as de-escalation in the US-China trade war took place on Thursday.Both Singh and Hegseth, however, reiterated their commitment to a free, open and rules-bound Indo-Pacific at the meeting. While Singh said the bilateral partnership was ""critical"" to ensure the region remains free from coercion, Hegseth said the US was committed to working closely with India to ensure the same.At a separate meeting with Chinese defence minister Admiral Dong Jun, Hegseth stressed the importance of ""maintaining a balance of power in the Indo-Pacific"" while voicing concerns about China's activities in the South China Sea, around Taiwan, and vis-a-vis allies and partners of the US in the Indo-Pacific. ""US does not seek conflict. It will continue to stoutly defend its interests and ensure it has the capabilities in the region to do so,"" he posted on X.The US, of course, is eyeing more lucrative Indian defence deals, having bagged contracts worth over $25 billion since just 2007. India, for instance, is slated to receive 31 armed MQ-9B Predator high-altitude long-endurance drones, ordered from the US for $3.8 billion in Oct last year, in the 2029-30 timeframe. India is also set to order another 113 GE-F404 turbofan jet engines from US firm General Electric for $1 billion to power the indigenous Tejas Mark-1A fighters. The delivery of 99 such engines, ordered in Aug 2021 by Hindustan Aeronautics for $716 million, recently began after a two-year delay.","The 'Framework for the US-India Major Defence Partnership' builds on the one inked in June 2015.

NEW DELHI: India continues to keep close tabs on Chinese warships and spy vessels in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR), even as it gears up to host the navies of both the US and Russia, among 55 countries, at the 'Milan' maritime exercise and International Fleet Review (IFR) at Visakhapatnam in Feb.""There is a continuous presence of extra-regional powers in the IOR due to the ongoing situation.

NDA manifesto ‘blueprint for state’s progress’: PM Modi

PATNA: The NDA on Friday made a welfare and aspirational pitch in the Bihar assembly elections, countering RJD's govt job campaign with the promise of creating over one crore employment opportunities, including in govt, based on an elaborate skill census.It also sought to consolidate crucial support bases, such as extremely backward class (EBC) voters, with the alliance's joint manifesto promising a high-level committee to assess the socio-economic status of each community and steps to empower them.The allies, led by BJP and JD(U), unveiled a plan to top up the Rs 6,000 PM-KISAN support with a Rs 3,000 annual payout. Besides, there is the promise of free education ""KG to PG"", and a Panchamrit Guarantee - free electricity up to 125 units, free foodgrain, free treatment up to Rs 5 lakh, 50 lakh new houses, and pensions.NDA promised an infrastructure boost in Bihar to bring it on a par with other states through a focus on development, be it new cities - including New Patna and Sitapuram, a greenfield project near Sitamarhi - rapid rail, seven new expressways, or more airports and bringing direct international flights to four airports. A new airport near Patna and one in Bhagalpur are also planned.The manifesto, jointly released by CM Nitish Kumar, Union minister and BJP national president J P Nadda, JDU national working president Sanjay Kumar Jha, Union ministers Jitan Ram Manjhi and Chirag Paswan, and RLM chief Upendra Kushwaha, contains 25 key points.""We will build world-class medical institutions, complete construction of approved medical colleges in every district, set up modern super-specialty hospitals dedicated to children and autism and a dedicated 'centre of excellence' for identified priority sportspersons in every division,"" said deputy CM Samrat Chaudhary.In an outreach to another key constituency, the manifesto has announced assistance of up to Rs 2 lakh under the CM Mahila Rozgar Scheme for women, and vowed to create one crore 'Lakhpati Didis' along with 'Mission Crorepati'.Apart from the monthly financial assistance of Rs 2,000 to scheduled caste students pursuing higher education, the manifesto pledges financial aid of up to Rs 10 lakh for EBC youths for self-employment.The emphasis on jobs was a clear focus given the discourse around migration and failure to create employment. But unlike RJD's pitch for one govt job for every family, BJP's emphasis is on skilling and creating the platform for employment.The Rs 1 lakh crore Developed Bihar Industrial Mission, complete with 10 new industrial parks and a Rs 50 lakh crore investment target, are meant to lay the foundation. There will be emphasis on defence manufacturing, global capability centres, creating an AI hub and a tech and fintech city as the NDA seeks to ensure that there are enough jobs within the state, which also addresses concerns over migration. MSMEs were pitched as the other area of emphasis, again aimed at creating employment while also meeting the requirements of large industries.Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday described the NDA’s election manifesto for Bihar as “a blueprint for the state’s progress and aspirations”, asserting that it reflected the alliance’s resolve to turn Bihar into a developed and self-reliant state. “The NDA’s sankalp-patra for the Bihar assembly elections clearly presents our vision for an Atmanirbhar and Viksit Bihar,” Modi said.He added, “It reflects our commitment to improving the lives of farmers, youth, mothers and sisters, and all families of Bihar. The state’s double-engine govt has spared no effort for all-round development, and we are determined to accelerate these efforts further to make good governance the foundation of prosperity for every citizen.” Modi expressed confidence that “the people of Bihar will wholeheartedly support our efforts. ” The NDA manifesto promises wide-ranging welfare and infrastructure initiatives.Home minister Amit Shah echoed the PM, saying NDA under Modi and Nitish Kumar’s leadership is “committed to building a developed Bihar”. “Today, NDA has released its sankalp-patra to speed up development reaching every section of society. From heritage to high-tech innovation, Bihar is ready for a giant leap,” Shah said, adding a dedicated Flood Management Board and the ‘Flood to Fortune’ initiative would make Bihar flood-free.","NDA promises to create over one crore employment opportunities, including in govt, based on an elaborate skill census.

Perhaps the press conference was cut short to prevent him from speaking.""Also Read: Bihar elections 2025: NDA vs Mahagathbandhan manifesto war — who promised what Confident of Mahagathbandhan’s prospects in state, Tejashwi said, ""This is just 'jumla.'

People of the state want to end unemployment.""Accusing the NDA of stealing his ideas, he said, ""They copy everything.They say they will provide one crore jobs. They ask me where will I generate jobs from. They should say where will they do it from.""RJD MP and party supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav’s daughter, Misa Bharti, also hit out at the NDA’s manifesto, questioning the alliance’s job promises. ""How will they provide that (1 crore government jobs)? Where will they get the money from? When we said we would provide 10 lakh government jobs, we did.

PATNA: After decades of being the face of RJD, patriarch Lalu Prasad is ceding political space to his son Tejashwi Yadav as INDIA bloc's Bihar chief ministerial candidate takes centre stage in a poll campaign designed to recast the party's image around the heir.Lalu, still the RJD president, doesn't feature in any of the poll posters projecting Tejashwi as Bihar's ""nayak"" and promising momentous changes if he is elected CM. The ailing former CM and Union minister hasn't been seen in public either, although his wife Rabri Devi, also a former CM, did travel to Raghopur recently.So, is Lalu's health the only reason he isn't part of the campaign or has one of Bihar's most influential political figures over several decades outlived his utility?RJD sources said that Lalu receding into the background is part of a conscious attempt to neutralise the negative factors associated with the state's main opposition party. RJD's 15-year stint in govt still invites ""jungle raj"" jibes from NDA, with Lalu being painted as the central figure.Sources added that the patriarch, known for his witty asides and retorts, is still active on social media platforms, targeting his rivals with his trademark one-liners.""Lalu's name or posters featuring him provide fodder to NDA to target us. So, the party brass has cleverly planned to keep him out of poll campaign this time, focusing on Tejashwi instead,"" said an RJD functionary.In 2020, Tejashwi came close to forming govt, with only 12 seats separating the RJD-led alliance from NDA. The gap in total votes polled for both sides was 11,150.The general impression is that Tejashwi is being extra cautious this time about not wading into any controversy. He is also trying to ""give a touch of positivity to the campaign"", talking about providing jobs to every family, regularising services of contractual workers in govt departments, and ending migration.His favourite pitch? ""Just give me a chance, and I will do in 20 months what wasn't done in 20 years.""

Goodbye, Frequent FASTag Recharges! NHAI Launches Annual Pass for Rs 3,000

What is KYV?

The Process

The Pain

If recurring KYCs was not enough, there’s now a KYV that you must go through if you happen to own a vehicle. Short for know your vehicle, this new process that is supposed to sanitise your FASTag is the latest compliance burden to be thrust on Indians.What was the need? Apparently, cases of misuse of FASTags — in some cases by truck drivers who were using tags meant for cars — convinced policy-makers that they needed a nationwide firewall to prevent a bunch of delinquents from misusing FASTags.It was rolled out as a mandatory process, beginning Oct 31, 2024, that requires all FASTag users to submit images of their vehicle and registration certificate to verify that the tag is linked to the correct vehicle. A National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) initiative, KYV was notified by National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI). To prevent fraud. And if you thought this was a one-time process, you’re wrong. The verification must be repeated every three years so that the database stays always updated. Why? The possibility of misuse, and ingenious delinquents finding more ways to bend the system.A govt official explained that instances had emerged of people keeping loose FASTags in their pockets or wallets, instead of fixing them on their vehicle windshields, “leading to misuse”.“In some cases, tags issued for cars were used on trucks to pay lower toll charges. KYV will put an end to such misuse,” said another official.A source said since the main thrust of the FASTag rollout was to increase its usage so that toll collection became digitised, there may have been some laxity on the part of banks while issuing them. A KYV, said officials, will “help sanitise the system”.“Ensuring a FASTag is assigned to and affixed on the correct category of vehicle, and that it remains active, is crucial as we prepare to roll out multi-lane free flow (MLFF) system of tolling in which vehicles will neither need to stop, nor slow down as there will be no physical barriers, said a road transport ministry official.Govt aims to bring all national highways that have four or more lanes under MLFF tolling in the next 4-5 years. Therefore, according to officials, one vehicle, one tag is so important.Asked why not detect and disable fraudulent tags or penalise those using multiple tags on the same vehicle, there were no clear answers.According to the circular issued by NPCI, all FASTags need to comply with KYV norms. The process mandates linking the FASTag to the unique Vehicle Registration Number (VRN) and chassis number. FASTag issuers, meanwhile, need to follow the one-vehicle-one tag mandate and replace all tags that are more than five years old.So, anyone with a FASTag must upload their vehicle registration certificate (RC), take a picture of their vehicle from the front and upload that along with the FASTtag and vehicle registration number, besides a side image with the tag and vehicle axles. All these, mind you, must be clearly visible.Issuers need to verify this with the VAHAN database, customer mobile number, and data entered by the point-of-sale agent. FASTags without a valid KYV will get automatically deactivated.While there is great conviction among decision-makers that KYV is the right way to go, there are unpleasant surprises galore that the process is throwing up for people, from being stopped at toll plazas and being told FASTag isn’t working because of “non-compliance with KYV”, to encountering an upload process that involves multiple rounds of clicking photos and sharing documents. Adding to frustrations is its propensity to get stuck — a backend that is simply not prepared to handle such a mammoth job — and sending harried users back to square one.“I was told by a toll gate attendant that my FASTag isn’t working because KYV hasn’t been completed. So, I stopped and had to go through the entire process of taking photos and uploading documents from the toll plaza, just so I could drive on without a penalty despite having a legal and functional FASTag. Govt talks about ease of life, ease of travel, ease of business, etc. How is this ease of anything?” a Delhi resident who recently had to do a KYV at a toll plaza in NCR asked.Having seen people struggle through this, govt officials have started telling banks they should not deactivate tags without calling up customers and informing them about the KYV norm. Sources said the issuer bank, not NPCI, is involved in backend processing of KYV documents.A senior road transport ministry official admitted the process needs to be made easier for the people. Another official said that having a similar process across bank portals and a helpline to guide people could be useful.",KYV was notified by National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) to prevent fraud. The verification must be repeated every three years so that the database stays always updated.

NEW DELHI: Union home minister Amit Shah on Thursday criticised Congress MP Rahul Gandhi , alleging that Gandhi insulted the Chhath Puja festival as he is ignorant of India's culture since Italy is his ""maternal home"".Addressing multiple rallies in Bihar, Shah said the INDIA bloc will be ""wiped out"" and that voters would ""avenge"" what he called an ""insult to Chhathi Maiyya"". He also referred to an earlier incident where Congress workers in the state allegedly abused Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s mother.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had held one of his election meetings in the Muzaffarpur on Wednesday, and alleged that the PM had tried to enact a ""drama"" by planning to take a dip in the Yamuna at Delhi, on the occasion of Chhath Puja.He had alleged that Modi gave up his plans to take a dip when it came to light that the spot he had chosen was a puddle created with clean, piped water, since the Yamuna was extremely polluted and not fit for a bath.""Rahul baba has said Modi and others who worshipped Chhathi Maiyya were indulging in drama. His maternal roots are in Italy, and hence he has no idea about the country's culture,"" Shah said, as quoted by PTI. He asked voters to press the EVM button on NDA symbols ""with such rage that the tremors are felt in Italy"".The home minister accused the Congress and its allies of preventing the construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya. He said, ""thwarting for 70 years"" the construction of the temple, which he said had been a matter of struggle ""since the times of the Mughals, and continued under the British"".Shah praised the Modi government for developing a new university at Nalanda, saying ""no Bakhtiyar Khilji will be able to destroy"" it. He also mentioned an ongoing project worth about Rs 850 crore to develop Punaura Dham in Sitamarhi district, which is linked to the birthplace of Goddess Sita. ""In two years from now, you will see PM Modi performing the consecration ceremony (pran pratishtha) at Punaura Dham,"" he said.At a rally in Nalanda, Shah opened his speech with references to Chanakya and Chandragupta Maurya. He then criticised the previous RJD governments led by Lalu Prasad and Rabri Devi, saying Bihar witnessed ""over 32,000 kidnappings and 12 major massacres"" during their tenure. He said, ""Nitish Kumar ended the ‘jungle raj’... but RJD is trying to bring back ‘jungle raj’ in the state with a new face.""Shah rejected claims by Tejashwi Yadav that the NDA would take back money deposited in women’s accounts under welfare schemes. ""Nobody can dare to take that money back. RJD leaders must give up this diatribe,"" he said.The home minister said that during Nitish Kumar’s time in power, ""there has been a 20 per cent drop in murders while dacoities and kidnappings have gone down by 80 per cent"".

NEW DELHI: Govt on Thursday announced ""some Indian companies"" have got approval from China to import rare earth magnets, to be used in automotive and electronics industries.MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said licenses have been issued, which will enable access to the magnets whose procurement had been stopped after China put curbs on their sale earlier this year.MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal on Thursday confirmed that some Indian companies have received licences for importing rare earth magnets from China, while responding to questions on the matter.""As far as the question of the latest talks and relaxations that have happened between the US and China (and) as to how it is going to play into our domain, I will come back to you. We have yet to look at it. I am not aware of the technicalities... But I do confirm that Indian companies have received licenses for importing rare earths from China,"" he said.Jaiswal, however, did not give details of the companies that have received permission. Industry sources said the companies include those that supply components to the automotive and electronics industries.However, the imports come with certain restrictions. These include conditions that the magnets cannot be exported to the US, and cannot be used for defence-related industries.The curbs have impacted the production of automobiles, especially electric cars and two-wheelers with companies petitioning govt to take up the matter with China.Rare earth magnets are the strongest type of permanent magnets commercially available. Their high magnetic strength and resistance to demagnetisation make them indispensable in a range of applications, especially where weight and space are constraints.According to experts, these magnets are made primarily from rare earth elements like neodymium, praseodymium, and dysprosium - materials that allow for powerful magnetic properties essential in miniaturised and energy-efficient devices. They are typically made from alloys that contain rare earth elements. The most commonly used rare earth magnet is the neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) magnet.China is estimated to account for about 70% of global rare earth metals mining and holds nearly 90% of the world's rare earth magnet's production. One of the biggest reasons that China dominates the rare earth magnet industry is its control over the entire supply chain, including mining of rare earth ores, separation and refining of rare earth elements (a complex and environmentally sensitive process), and alloy production and magnet manufacturing.Just in the Indian auto industry alone, about 870 tonnes of rare-earth magnets are required to be imported in FY 2025-26 out of the country's estimated overall requirement of 3,600 tonnes.","MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said licenses have been issued, which will enable access to the magnets.

The Asian Arowana: Ancient fish that rules the modern aquarium



The Asian Arowana: From banned species to billion-dollar status symbol



The super red Arowana : The fiery dragon fish worth more than gold



Also Read |





For centuries, dragons have embodied prosperity, power, and mystery in Asian culture. Today, that legend lives on in the Asian arowana, famously known as the dragon fish and hailed as the world’s most expensive aquarium fish. Native to the rivers and swamps of Southeast Asia, this ancient predator moves with elegant precision, its metallic scales shimmering like coins of gold under filtered light. As highlighted by National Geographic, the arowana’s mythical resemblance to dragons has made it a potent symbol of luck and wealth across generations. Coveted by collectors, enthusiasts, and investors alike, it now commands staggering prices, often exceeding the value of gold, transforming a once humble river dweller into a living emblem of prosperity, success, and timeless prestige.The Asian arowana (Scleropages formosus) is no ordinary tropical fish. Growing up to three feet in length, it glides through the dark waters of Southeast Asia with hypnotic grace, its large, shimmering scales catching light like polished coins. Two slender barbels extend from its chin, evoking the whiskers of a dragon, a resemblance that fuels its legendary reputation as a bearer of fortune, power, and eternal protection across Asian cultures.This prehistoric species, believed to have existed since the age of dinosaurs, thrives in slow-moving rivers and peat swamps in Borneo, Malaysia, and Indonesia. Yet, it is far from a humble creature. In the modern world, an arowana can command prices as high as £250,000 per fish, a valuation that has elevated it from swamp inhabitant to luxury treasure.In the 1970s, the Asian arowana was added to the list of endangered species under CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora). The trade ban was meant to protect its dwindling numbers in the wild. Instead, it ignited a new kind of frenzy.The ban transformed the arowana from a simple food fish into an elite, forbidden object of desire. Collectors across Asia began competing for the rare, mystical “dragon fish.” Suddenly, what once sold for a few dollars in a local market became a high-stakes commodity worth tens of thousands.By the late 20th century, farms in Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia began breeding the fish legally under government licence. These operations were run like fortresses with guards, surveillance systems, and barbed wire to protect their valuable stock. Each fish was microchipped and issued an identification certificate to prove its legal, captive-bred origin. Despite such measures, black market smuggling and theft became part of the trade’s darker undercurrent.Among the many colour varieties, green, gold, and silver, the Super Red arowana reigns supreme. Found in the remote Kapuas River basin and the Lake Sentarum wetlands of Borneo, its scales shimmer in rich shades of ruby and crimson. In the right light, it appears almost aflame, like a dragon rising from the depths.This rare beauty can sell for astronomical prices. Reports claim that elite collectors, including high-ranking officials and business magnates, have spent more than £200,000 for a single fish. During international fish exhibitions, these rare specimens are transported in tanks escorted by security guards proof that even a creature of water can inspire terrestrial greed and glamour.Former Indonesian president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono was said to have owned one himself, paying around £10,000 for his prized arowana. For many, ownership signifies not just wealth, but alignment with luck, prosperity, and spiritual balance.","The Asian arowana (Scleropages formosus) is no ordinary tropical fish.

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy says that the company’s latest round of layoffs that impacted barely 14,000 people is not because of money or AI. Instead, the real reason behind Amazon job cuts is the culture, Jassy said. “The announcement that we made a few days ago was not really financially driven, and it's not even really AI-driven, not right now at least,” he said as quoted by Business Insider. “It really — it's culture.”“And if you grow as fast as we did for several years, the size of businesses, the number of people, the number of locations, the types of businesses you're in, you end up with a lot more people than what you had before, and you end up with a lot more layers,” Jassy explained.“And when that happens, Sometimes, without realizing it, you can weaken the ownership of the people that you have who are doing the actual work,” he added. “And it can lead to slowing you down.”In a blog post dated October 28, Amazon's senior vice president of people experience and technology, Beth Galetti announced that the e-commerce company is “making organizational changes across Amazon that will impact some of our teammates.”“While this will include reducing in some areas and hiring in others, it will mean an overall reduction in our corporate workforce of approximately 14,000 roles,” she said.Amazon’s latest job cuts is the company’s biggest layoff since 2022 when the company laid off 27,000 positions. Jassy’s remarks contradict what Amazon executive has been saying about the job cuts.In the blog post, Galetti explained “This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones). We’re convinced that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business.”Separately, Tapas Roy, vice president of device software and services sent a company-wide email this week saying the company is cutting roles within its OS & Services team and asked remaining workers to ""lean in on AI.""","Amazon CEO Andy Jassy says that the company’s latest round of layoffs that impacted barely 14,000 people is not because of money or AI. “The announcement that we made a few days ago was not really financially driven, and it's not even really AI-driven, not right now at least,” he said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124986273,imgsize-17580,width-400,resizemode-4/amazon-ceo-andy-jassy.jpg"

Apple iPhone sales





Apple reported a surprise fall in sales in China. However, much to investors and the company's relief, the fall has not been due to the decline in demand. Apple reportedly blamed the surprise decline in China revenue on supply disruptions. According to a report in Bloomberg, Apple has predicted that the company will return to growth in the world’s biggest smartphone arena as the iPhone 17 gains momentum. Apple CEO Tim Cook said at the earnings call, “It was basically supply constraints that drove the results.” Cook added, “We’re thrilled with what we’re seeing right now.”Apple CEO said that Apple’s store traffic is up significantly in China, and that the latest iPhones -- iPhone 17 series -- has been well received. Cook also said that Apple reached a new high for September-quarter revenue from services in China, while reiterating that the iPhone is doing very well.According to the report, China was a prominent topic during the earning conference, with analysts asking about the region multiple times. The threat of higher tariffs has disrupted global tech supply chain that’s already in flux because of longer-term decisions to diversify away from China.Apple’s total growth projection for the December quarter is between 10% and 12%. Cook, however, didn't specify how much China would contribute to that.Apple has seen stiffer competition from local brands in China. Reports suggest that Huawei Technologies took the top spot in June, as its campaign to reclaim a bigger share of the premium tier resonated with Chinese consumers. Xiaomi too is reported to have made a splash with its Xiaomi 17 series.IDC estimates that 58.6 million iPhones were sold worldwide in the July-September quarter, putting Apple second behind Samsung at 61.4 million of their Android-powered phones sold worldwide in the quarter.In a conference call with analysts, Tim Cook indicated his belief that the iPhone 17 lineup will continue to do well, predicting even more of the devices will be sold during the final three months of the year. “As we head into the holiday season with our most powerful lineup ever, I couldn’t be more excited for what’s to come,” Cook said. Apple expects its iPhone sales to increase at least 10% from last year's holiday season, according to projections provided by Apple's chief financial officer, Kevan Parekh. Total revenue is expected to rise at a similar rate.","Apple reported a surprise fall in sales in China.

CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Meta Q3 results





President Donald Trump's Big Beautiful Bill has resulted in a $16 billion hit for Mark Zuckerberg 's Meta. Meta Platforms has taken a near $16 billion one-off charge in the third quarter (Q3) related to President Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill. The company, which owns Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram, said that the bill had led the business to take a non-cash income tax charge of $15.93 billion. Meta said that excluding this, its third-quarter net income would have increased by $15.93 billion to $18.64 billion, compared with the reported net income of $2.71 billion. The expense crashed Meta's third-quarter profit.Incidentally, this is the same bill that Elon Musk and President TrumpThe implementation of Donald Trump's 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act led to “the recognition of a valuation allowance against our U.S. federal deferred tax assets, reflecting the impact of the U.S. Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax,” Meta said. Meta also said, “We expect a significant reduction in our U.S. federal cash tax payments for the remainder of 2025 and future years due to the implementation of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. ”The markets didn't seem pleased with $16 billion charge taken by Meta, as the company's stock fell sharply lower on Wall Street, though briefly.The shares fell $53.60, or 7 per cent, to $698.99 in after-hours trading on Wall Street but recovered to close at $751.67, up less than 1 per cent.“We had a strong quarter for our business and our community,” Mark Zuckerberg, Meta founder and CEO, said in announcing the results. “Meta Superintelligence Labs is off to a great start and we continue to lead the industry in AI glasses.

"Bihar polls: My age may be young, but my promise is mature, says Tejashwi Yadav",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-polls-my-age-may-be-young-but-my-promise-is-mature-says-tejashwi-yadav/articleshow/125009260.cms,"Tejashwi Yadav (ANI)

As the Bihar assembly election campaign intensifies, INDIA bloc’s chief ministerial candidate, Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, lays out his vision for development, employment and economic justice while taking aim at his political rivals.

He shares his plans to create jobs, strengthen the economy and build an inclusive Bihar with TOI’s AlokKNMishra. Excerpts:

You are the chief ministerial candidate of the INDIA bloc and have been campaigning extensively across Bihar for the past several weeks. What promises are you making to people, and what feedback are you getting?

Battle for Bihar: Raghopur Voters Ask Tough Questions to RJD's Tejashwi Yadav Ahead of Key Contest

You have pledged to provide a govt job for every family. Critics argue that this may not be financially feasible for Bihar, which does not have the financial resources to fund this. How do you plan to implement this promise?

Have you consulted experts, carried out any study or prepared a blueprint for this?

The INDIA bloc and the NDA are both contesting the election on the development plank. How is the RJD-led alliance’s development plank different from the NDA's?

Having served as deputy chief minister under Nitish Kumar, what do you think about Nitish Kumar's style of leadership and the way he runs the Government?

RJD has traditionally relied on support from the Muslim-Yadav vote base. This time, you have fielded more candidates from women, Dalits, and EBC communities. How is the RJD attempting to broaden its appeal beyond the MuslimYadav combination?

The voting patterns in recent Bihar elections indicate that a larger share of EBC, upper-caste and several groups within the Dalit community voters have favoured the NDA over the RJD

Women in Bihar have traditionally been seen as strong supporters of Nitish Kumar. What strategies is the RJD adopting to attract more women voters in this election?

Do you think the women of Bihar are going to support the INDIA bloc this time?

The NDA is contesting the election under the leadership of Nitish Kumar, but it has not yet categorically announced that Nitish will be the CM if the NDA wins. What is your view on this?

Why will the NDA not make Nitish Kumar the CM?

RJD rule in Bihar ended 20 years ago. Even now, many people say that a return of the RJD to power could bring back the ‘jungle raj’ of the past. Why do such perceptions persist even after so many years since the RJD last governed Bihar?

You have been saying that Lalu Yadav gave social justice to the people of Bihar, and you will deliver economic justice. Can you elaborate?

There have been reports of internal differences within the INDIA bloc. How have you addressed or managed these challenges?

But across 11 se

ats, the INDIA bloc partners are contesting against each other in what is being described as a friendly fight.

Congress is an important partner of the RJD-led alliance in Bihar. It won 19 seats in 2020. How do you feel it is going to perform in this election?

Did you give any suggestions to Congress when they were finalising the tickets?

There seems to be tension in your family, with your elder brother’s newly formed party (Janshakti Janata Dal) contesting the election against many RJD candidates. As his younger brother, many would expect him to support you and stand shoulder to shoulder with you in this crucial time. How do you respond to this?

Is there any possibility of the RJD again aligning with Nitish Kumar’s party JD(U) in future?

How challenging is Prashant Kishor’s Jan Suraaj for the INDIA bloc?

You are the INDIA bloc’s CM face. The VIP (Vikassheel Insaan Party) chief is the deputy chief minister face. Is there a possibility that there could be another deputy CM from the Muslim community?

We have taken an oath to make Bihar the number one state in the country and that is our ultimate objective. Our vision is to build a Bihar where no Bihari brother or sister has to migrate in search of work or opportunities. Every facility and opportunity should be available right here, in our own state. Bihar should have factories and job opportunities, as well as quality hospitals, colleges and universities.Factories should be set up, jute mills reopened, food processing units established and new IT parks and SEZs developed.Our goal is to make Bihar an educational hub so that students do not have to go to places like Kota to prepare for exams and we want to build good hospitals so that people do not have to travel outside the state for treatment. Bihar today is one of the poorest states with the lowest per capita income. We are determined to change that by ensuring that every citizen has access to education, healthcare, income, opportunities and justice – and that the govt is truly action-oriented.Bihar also has immense potential in the tourism sector – whether it is religious tourism, heritage tourism or general tourism. We want to develop this potential and promote Bihar as a major tourism destination. We want to make such a Bihar that moves ahead on the path of progress. We are getting a great response from the people who want a change in Bihar.Let the people say what they want to say. The last time, they were saying that giving 10 lakh jobs was impossible. Now, the same people – the BJP and JD(U) – have been forced to talk about jobs, and they are saying they will give one crore jobs. We have done and shown what we promised.We gave five lakh jobs – about 3.5 lakh every year during the 17 months from Aug 2022 to Jan 2024, when I served as deputy chief minister in the Grand Alliance govt. We also gave the status of Bihar govt employees to over four lakh contractual teachers in the state in Dec 2023. So, we have already done it, and soon we will turn this task – which looks impossible – into a possible one. My age may be young, but my promise is mature.We do not make any announcements without consulting the experts and without conducting the required research and study. We only make announcements that are feasible and practical. We have prepared the blueprint for it.The NDA has no development plank and no vision for Bihar. The BJP wants factories to be set up only in Gujarat – the semiconductor factory is in Gujarat, investor meetings are held there, SEZs are established there, and even the international stadium is built there.Everything is being done in Gujarat, while nothing is being done for Bihar. They have no road map or vision for Bihar. Amit Shah (union home minister) himself said that there is a dearth of land in Bihar, which is why factories and industries cannot be set up here. So, they have made it clear that they have no development plan for Bihar.At present, Nitish Kumar has been reduced to just a puppet. BJP is running the govt while Nitish Kumar is merely a figurehead – the real power lies with Narendra Modi and Amit Shah. We even have sympathy for Nitish Kumar, considering his current condition.This is the same Nitish Kumar who once snapped ties with the NDA after Narendra Modi was announced the chief of the BJP’s campaign committee for the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. He had even cancelled a dinner planned for Modi in Patna. In the past, the same Nitish Kumar returned the Rs 5 crore Koshi flood relief donation from the Narendra Modi-led Gujarat govt in 2010 when the Gujarat govt issued advertisements for it.And now, Nitish ji has, unfortunately, become a puppet and his health condition also does not allow him to run the govt effectivelyThe RJD has always been a party for everyone – inclusive since the very beginning. No govt has given as much representation in the state cabinet to upper castes as the one led by Laluji. Similarly, no other govt has matched the number of leaders from the EBC category who were made MLAs, MLCs, and given various opportunities under the govt of Laluji.It was Laluji who made Bhagwati Devi, the daughter of the Musahar community, an MP. He ensured that every section of society received respect and representation in governance. Yes, some people may have left us at times, but eventually, all of them have come back — because they know that the RJD truly belongs to everyone.In the 2020 election, the difference between the NDA and the Mahagathbandhan was only 12,000 votes, which was less than 1%. It shows that we got votes from all sections of society.The women have woken up now. The truth has come out in the open – that women were often exploited and were denied the respect and rights they truly deserved. This is why there is a growing sense of dissatisfaction among women with the Nitish govt.See, due to growing dissatisfaction among women, the Nitish govt had to give a Rs 10,000 bribe to each woman just before the elections. They realised that their support base among women was drifting away, especially after we announced the ‘Mai Bahin Maan Yojana’ for the women of Bihar, under which women in Bihar will receive Rs 2,500 per month as financial assistance to make them financially independent, and we spoke about making Jeevika Didis permanent.This has clearly panicked the NDA. That is why they are giving out Rs 10,000 in the middle of the election, and yet the Election Commission is not stopping them. What is the emergency that justifies this?Amit Shah ji and the BJP are clear that Nitish Kumar will not become the chief minister again. It is totally clear. He will meet the same fate as Shinde ji (Eknath Shinde was not reinstated as CM after the BJP won a majority in the 2024 Maharashtra assembly elections).His situation is not the same. The BJP wants to have its own chief minister in Bihar because, until now, they have never had one. They aspire for it, but that ambition will never be fulfilled.See, this is nothing but complete propaganda and a wrong perception fuelled by those opposed to the RJD. Lalu ji always gave respect to everyone and worked to ensure equality in society. Those who considered themselves superior by birth had to sit at the same level as Dalits and backward communities. This created resentment among such people. True superiority comes from one’s actions, not from birth. Lalu ji made everyone equal and upheld this principle consistently.We are living in an economic age, and people deserve economic justice. Inflation is soaring, jobs are scarce, and household expenses are rising rapidly. How are people supposed to manage their daily lives? Since Modi came to power, under the NDA govt, everything has become more expensive.Modi ji had promised to bring down inflation, but prices have risen fivefold since he took office – fuel, food, and almost everything has become costlier, while people’s incomes remain stagnant. Small and medium-scale factories are shutting down, businesses are struggling and the economy is not growing as it should. The situation worsened further after Trump imposed tariffs. Now is the time to ensure true economic justice for the people.There were no fissures in the INDIA bloc. There was no problem. It was only in the media.The friendly fight is being conducted strategically. In Jharkhand, we contested and won elections despite similar arrangements. Likewise, in Jammu & Kashmir, the INDIA bloc had friendly fights, and they emerged victorious. In Bihar, the situation is no different. We remain united and strong, contesting the elections with our full strength, and we are going to win the elections.Congress will perform much better this time. We are confident of winning more seats compared to 2020, as we have focused carefully on the winnability factor and meticulously selected our candidates.We all sit together and discuss it – the selection of candidates.That’s alright. In a democracy, everyone has the right to form their own party and contest elections. Yes, it would have been far better if the things that happened had not happened, but this is the reality, and we have to accept it.Now, the Janata Dal (United) will not survive after the elections are over. Half of the JD(U) leaders will go to the BJP and half will come to the RJD.We do not care about such things – who is coming to Bihar, who is making what party. Our only focus is to make Bihar the number one state in the country. Our fight is against unemployment.It has already been announced that there will be one more deputy CM if the INDIA bloc forms the govt. When the right time comes, the decision about it will be taken collectively by the alliance partners and an announcement will be made.","Tejashwi Prasad Yadav is the chief ministerial candidate of the INDIA bloc.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

"US govt shutdown impact: Air traffic controllers unpaid, flights delayed; staffing crunch hits key airports",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-govt-shutdown-impact-air-traffic-controllers-unpaid-flights-delayed-staffing-crunch-hits-key-airports/articleshow/125009314.cms,"FULL: ‘Dems, Drop F-bombs, Ignore Americans’: Mike Johnson’s Furious Outburst | US Shutdown Day 30

Disruptions follow chaotic night of flight cancellations

Urgent calls for Congress to end the shutdown

Industry fears holiday chaos

Budget deadlock continues





The US government shutdown has entered its second month, disrupting several sectors and heavily impacting the nation’s air travel industry. Airports across the country continue to face massive delays amid a growing shortage of air traffic controllers, many of whom have now missed their first full paycheck.The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said Friday that nearly half of the 30 busiest US airports are struggling with staffing shortages, according to Reuters.The shortage has caused significant delays at major hubs including Boston, Phoenix, San Francisco, Nashville, Houston, Dallas, and airports in the Washington D.C. area. In New York, JFK, LaGuardia, and Newark Liberty airports are facing average delays of around two hours.The crisis deepened Thursday after the FAA reported that no certified controllers were available for the evening shift at Orlando International Airport, forcing the agency to activate contingency measures. That decision created a chain reaction of delays along the East Coast, leading to a chaotic night of travel for passengers.“Currently, half of our Core 30 facilities are experiencing staffing shortages, and nearly 80 percent of air traffic controllers are absent at New York–area facilities,” the FAA said in a statement posted on X.Transportation officials and aviation unions have renewed calls for Congress to resolve the funding deadlock. Reuters, citing Fox News’ America Newsroom, reported that US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned of worsening flight disruptions.“Coming into this weekend and then the week after, I think you are going to see even more disruptions in the airspace,” Reuters quoted Duffy as saying.Nick Daniels, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, urged lawmakers to end the impasse immediately.“Congress must pass a clean continuing resolution to immediately end the government shutdown, ensure that all individuals who have not been paid during this prolonged closure receive their compensation, and then engage in bipartisan negotiations on other pressing issues facing our nation,” he said.The prolonged shutdown has raised fears of a “holiday meltdown” if the standoff continues into the Thanksgiving rush. Vice President JD Vance warned, “It could be a disaster. At that point, you’re talking about people have missed three paychecks. How many of them are not going to show up for work?”United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby said the impact is already being felt across the economy.“It’s putting stress on the economy,” he said. “It is time to pass a clean CR.”According to Reuters, more than 13,000 air traffic controllers and 50,000 Transportation Security Administration officers continue to work without pay.A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to pass a budget to fund federal agencies and programs. The current closure stems from a standoff between Republicans, who want a clean continuing resolution to reopen the government, and Democrats, who are pushing to include an extension of health insurance subsidies to prevent consumer cost hikes.As the shutdown stretches into its second month, travel disruptions are mounting — with no resolution yet in sight.","Airports across the country continue to face massive delays amid a growing shortage of air traffic controllers.

"Indian e-Passport rollout 2025: Embassy confirms no biometrics, no change in charges",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/indian-e-passport-rollout-2025-embassy-confirms-no-biometrics-no-change-in-charges/articleshow/124954371.cms,"UAE Indians Face No Extra Steps for New e-Passport / AI-generated illustration

What does the new e-passport rollout actually mean?

New e-passport = chip inside: The upgraded passport contains an electronic chip with digitised passport data to speed up immigration clearance and improve security. Applicants will be able to upload a digital, ICAO-compliant photo, signature and supporting documents through the new portal.

No extra biometrics or fees: The Indian Embassy in Abu Dhabi and the Consulate in Dubai stated explicitly that biometric collection rules and passport fees remain unchanged for applicants in the UAE. If you’ve given biometrics for a recent passport, you will not be asked again just because of the e-passport introduction.

Who issues them: The Embassy and Consulate will process applications through the Passport Seva Portal (GPSP 2.0) with support from BLS International for on-the-ground services. Missions say they can handle large volumes around 1,600 passports a day across the UAE to speed renewals and new issues.

What exactly is an Indian e-Passport?

Digital chip with encrypted security data

Improved fraud protection and identity verification

Faster processing at international airports

Globally compliant with ICAO standard

No change in services for Indians in UAE

Conclusion





Indian expats in the UAE can finally put the rumours to rest. During a press conference held on October 30, 2025 by the Embassy of India in Abu Dhabi and the Consulate General of India in Dubai, officials clarified that the rollout of India’s new chip-enabled e-passport will not involve any extra biometrics, new procedures, or fee changes for applicants in the UAE. The announcement came amid widespread speculation about additional requirements for the upgraded passport system.The e-passport looks like a regular passport but comes with a secure embedded chip containing the holder’s personal and biometric data. This upgrade enhances security and helps speed up global immigration checks, making travel simpler and safer.Key features of the e-passport include:The initiative is an important part of India’s ongoing mission to modernise travel documents, strengthen cyber-security measures, and align with global digital passport standards.For Indian residents in the UAE, the e-passport rollout will feel no different from the current process. Applicants will continue to use the same channels — including BLS centres, VFS services (where applicable), and the embassy or consulate counters, without the need for new appointments, extra document checks, or revised fees. The missions also urged the community to rely only on official updates from the Embassy or Consulate, reminding expats not to fall for misinformation circulating on social media.The clarification from the Indian Embassy in Abu Dhabi and the Consulate in Dubai has offered much-needed reassurance to the UAE’s Indian community. With no added fees, no extra biometrics, and no change in the application process, the transition to e-passports is set to be smooth and stress-free for expats. As India modernises its passport system to enhance global travel security, UAE-based applicants can continue using the same familiar services without any disruption. For now, the message is simple: nothing changes for you — just a smarter, more secure passport ahead.","The upgraded passport contains an electronic chip with digitised passport data.

November 2025 fuel prices

What’s Driving the November price Buzz?

Oil prices dropped to around $65 a barrel, raising hopes for a price cut.

Then global supply tensions and sanctions sent prices jumping again up by nearly 5% in one day.

What will become cheaper if prices drop in November?

Daily Commutes Get Cheaper: If you drive to work five days a week, your monthly fuel spend could drop by AED 15–40, depending on distance and car type. It may not feel like a jackpot but over a year, that’s a few brunches saved.

School Runs for Parents: Parents doing multiple school pick-ups and drop-offs will feel this the most. With fewer refills, you save not just dirhams… but also those “Why are we stopping for petrol again?” kid complaints.

Delivery & Ride-Hailing Services: Talabat, Deliveroo, Careem, Uber, RTA taxis, chauffeur services, all rely heavily on petrol costs. If fuel drops, operating costs drop and sometimes customers enjoy lower delivery fees or promo rides.

Business Transport & Logistics: Couriers, small business vans, carpenters, maintenance and AC technicians, all feel the heat when fuel rises. Cheaper petrol can mean:

Lower service charges Fewer fuel surcharges Better deals for customers

Weekends and Road Trips Become More Tempting: Lower fuel prices = guilt-free drives to Abu Dhabi, Fujairah, Ras Al Khaimah or Hatta. A small drop in fuel cost could shave off AED 5–15 per road trip enough to justify that karak stop.

'One Arrow, Two Targets': Indian Navy Sends Subtle Warning Message to China and Pakistan





Pakistan, heavily dependent on the waters of the Indus basin, faces a acute risk of insufficient water storage after India suspended the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) earlier this year, according to the Ecological Threat Report 2025.The report, released by the Institute for Economics and Peace, a Sydney-based independent and non-profit think tank, says the suspension gives India the ability to control the westward flow of the Indus and its tributaries into Pakistan. The move came after India decided to put the treaty in abeyance as a punitive measure following the Pakistan-sponsored Pahalgam terror attack on April 22 this year.This marks a major setback for Pakistan, whose agriculture depends 80 per cent on the Indus River system. The report highlighted that Pakistan’s dams can currently hold only about 30 days of Indus flow, leaving the country highly vulnerable to disruptions.“Pakistan lacks sufficient storage to buffer variations,” the report warned, adding, “If India were truly to cut off or significantly reduce Indus flows, Pakistan’s densely populated plains would face severe water shortages, especially in winter and dry seasons.Indeed, about 80 per cent of Pakistan’s irrigated agriculture depends on Indus basin rivers.”While India’s infrastructure limits its ability to completely stop river flows, even small disruptions could have ""disastrous"" short-term effects on Pakistan’s farm sector.In May, India carried out “reservoir flushing” operations at the Salal and Baglihar dams on the Chenab River without notifying Pakistan. This process, used to remove silt by draining reservoirs, had been restricted under the treaty due to the risk of sudden downstream changes.The impact was immediate: parts of the Chenab River in Pakistan’s Punjab ran dry for several days when India shut the dam gates and later released sediment-filled torrents upon reopening them.The Indus Waters Treaty, signed in 1960 and mediated by the World Bank, has long acted as a key tool for water-sharing and conflict resolution between the two countries. It governs the use of the Indus River and its six major tributaries -- five on the left bank and one on the right.","India suspended the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) earlier this year.

India-Bangladesh trade tensions :







Pakistan has granted Bangladesh access to Karachi Port in an effort to revitalize bilateral trade, marking a notable outcome of the 9th Pak–Bangladesh Joint Economic Commission (JEC) meeting -- the first such dialogue in two decades. The development arrives at a sensitive moment, as Dhaka’s relations with New Delhi grow increasingly strained following the fall of the Sheikh Hasina regime.According to the Pakistani news outlet Samaa TV, the port access would allow Dhaka to expand its trade network with China and Central Asian countries.According to the official statement, the two sides emphasized stronger cooperation between their national shipping lines, the news outlet reported.Pakistan’s decision to open Karachi Port to Bangladeshi vessels is expected to streamline trade routes for Dhaka, while also expanding opportunities for commercial engagement across regional and neighboring markets.Trade tensions between India and Bangladesh have been rising, with New Delhi imposing a series of restrictions on Dhaka’s exports this year. Most recently, India banned the import of select jute products and ropes from Bangladesh via all land routes, requiring shipments to be rerouted through the Nhava Sheva seaport in Maharashtra.These measures follow multiple earlier curbs that limited a wide range of Bangladeshi goods, including garments, processed foods, and jute fabrics, to seaborne entry only. India also withdrew a key transshipment facility in April, further tightening trade access and signaling a deepening strain in bilateral commercial ties.The latest trade curbs unfold amid heightened political friction, following comments made in China by Bangladesh’s interim government chief Muhammad Yunus that sparked sharp criticism across India’s political spectrum. Ties have also deteriorated over Dhaka’s inability to prevent rising violence against minorities, particularly the Hindu community.","Pakistan has granted Bangladesh access to Karachi Port in an effort to revitalize bilateral trade.

Bangladeshi generic version slashes rare disease drug’s price by 96%,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladeshi-generic-version-slashes-rare-disease-drugs-price-by-96/articleshow/124785805.cms,"Representaive image





Bangladeshi pharmaceutical company Beximco has launched a generic version of a triple combination therapy for a rare genetic disorder. US-based Vertex, which holds the patent for this therapy, charges $325,300 for a year’s treatment while the generic will slash the price by 96% to just $12,775 for adults and about $6,390 for a child per year.Patients of cystic fibrosis, a rare genetic disorder, and their families launched a community-run buyers’ club on Thursday to help patients around the world access the new generic version of the drug.Vertex’s monopoly is estimated to have generated almost $30 billion in profits over ten years just from the sale of the medicine for cystic fibrosis. A 2022 study on production costs of the medicine estimated that it could be produced for $5,700 per patient per year. Beximco is launching the generic version of the triple combination (elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor) listed as an essential medicine by the WHO . It is also launching a generic version of ivacaftor, one of the components, as the treatment consists of two tablets of the triple combination and one tablet of ivacaftor every day for adults.“This is a historic moment. We’ve watched children suffer and die while a treatment sat on the shelf, priced out of reach. Today, that changes. We’ve proven that patient power can change what billion-dollar corporations refuse to. Governments must act fast to take all the necessary steps to make this life saving drug available for every eligible patient,” said Gayle Pledger, who leads the global Right to Breathe campaign, which has been working to make this medicine accessible for cystic fibrosis patients.Cystic fibrosis disrupts mucus production in multiple organs, particularly the lungs and digestive system, leading to debilitating symptoms, such as serious chronic respiratory issues and malnutrition. Delayed diagnosis and lack of treatment contribute to an average life expectancy of less than 20 years.Tanya Takewani, mother of a child in India with cystic fibrosis, pointed out that 14 children died in 2024 waiting for treatment. “This drug has been available for more than six years. How many more children must have died in these years? There are 600 patients of cystic fibrosis identified in India. But only 50 of them get treatment under the Patient Assistance Programme. The development of a generic gives us hope,” said Takewani.Chetali Rao, a scientific researcher with Third World Network (TWN), a nonprofit that has been helping to make medicines accessible, said, “When a medicine costs more than life itself, it stops being an innovation, it becomes an exclusion. Trikafta can transform a life-threatening disease like cystic fibrosis into a manageable condition. It must be available and we were determined to find a way to make it affordable. ”This urgency drove TWN, together with patient groups Just Treatment in the UK and Right to Breathe, to approach Beximco with the proposal to develop an affordable generic alternative.","Bangladeshi pharmaceutical company Beximco has launched a generic version of a triple combination therapy for a rare genetic disorder.

A solid gold toilet is up for auction.

Guggenheim Museum in New York. (AP Photo, File)





LONDON: For sale: The world's most valuable toilet, a lavatory literally worth its weight in gold. Sotheby's announced Friday it will auction off the solid gold cistern, a sculpture by Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan entitled ""America. ""The auction house calls it an ""incisive commentary on the collision of artistic production and commodity value."" It's also a fully functional toilet, identical to one that gained global fame when it was stolen in an audacious heist from England's Blenheim Palace in 2019.The starting price at the Nov 18 auction in New York will be the price of the just over 101.2kg of gold used to make it - about $10 million.David Galperin, head of contemporary art at Sotheby's in New York, said Cattelan is ""the consummate art world provocateur."" He's also one of most successful, an artist whose work ""Comedian,"" a banana duct-taped to a wall, sold at a New York auction last year for $6.2 million. ""Him"" - Cattelan's unsettling sculpture of a kneeling Adolf Hitler - sold for $17.2 million at a Christie's auction in 2016.The artist has said ""America"" satirises excessive wealth.""Whatever you eat, a $200 lunch or a $2 hot dog, the results are the same, toilet-wise,"" he once said.Two versions of ""America"" were created in 2016. The one being sold has been owned by an unnamed collector since 2017. The other version went on display in a bathroom at the Guggenheim Museum in New York in 2016. More than 100,000 visitors queued up to - to put it delicately - interact with the work.The Guggenheim offered the work to US President Donald Trump during his first term in office after he had asked to borrow a Van Gogh painting.In 2019, it went on show at Blenheim Palace, the English country manor that was the birthplace of Winston Churchill. Within days, it was stolen by burglars who broke into the building, forcibly wrenched it from the plumbing, and fled. Two men were convicted earlier this year and jailed. The toilet has never been recovered. Investigators think it was likely broken up and melted down.Galperin is unwilling to speculate on how much ""America"" could sell for. He notes that Cattelan's duct-taped banana posed questions about ""how one assigns value to something that has, in essence, no value aside from its authorship and its conceptual idea.""'America' is in many ways the complete inverse of that. It is a perfect foil in that this work has a lot of intrinsic value in a way that most artworks do not,"" he said ""The question of the proportion of value between the raw materials and the artistic idea is very on the table here.""""America"" will go on display at Sotheby's new New York headquarters, the Breuer Building, from Nov 8 until the auction. It will be in a bathroom, and visitors will be able to see it up close and personal.At Guggenheim and Blenheim Palace, the toilet was connected to the plumbing system and visitors could book a 3-minute appointment to use it.

His lease on Royal Lodge has, to date, provided him with legal protection to continue in residence. Formal notice has now been served to surrender the lease and he will move to alternative private accommodation. These censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him. Their Majesties wish to make clear that their thoughts and utmost sympathies have been, and will remain with, the victims and survivors of any and all forms of abuse

Buckingham Palace announced that Prince Andrew would lose his prince title and vacate Royal Lodge in Windsor amid ongoing controversy over his links to paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein. The former duke agreed to surrender his remaining royal titles, including the Duke of York, earlier this month.The decision follows serious lapses in Andrew’s judgement, the palace said, although he continues to deny the accusations. It is understood he did not object to the King’s decision. The statement from Buckingham Palace in full:,"" the statement read, as per BBC news.,"" the statement added.Prince Andrew will be relocated to a property on the Sandringham Estate in Norfolk as soon as practicable after formal notice to surrender the lease at Royal Lodge was given on Thursday.Details of his specific accommodation have not been released. The wider Sandringham estate covers approximately 20,000 acres, including 600 acres of gardens, but the Palace has not said which property he will occupy.It is understood that Sarah Ferguson, 66, Andrew’s ex-wife, has also been asked to vacate Royal Lodge and will make her own living arrangements.The King will privately fund Andrew’s accommodation and will make “appropriate private provision” for his brother as he moves out of Royal Lodge.Earlier this week, the Public Accounts Committee wrote a letter detailing the “considerable and understandable public interest in the spending of public money” relating to Andrew. The letter asked what the Crown Estate’s plan was to ensure value for money in any future agreements with Andrew. Andrew is understood not to have objected to the King’s decision to remove his titles.The titles being stripped are Prince, Duke of York, Earl of Inverness and Baron Killyleagh. He will also lose the right to be called His Royal Highness and the honours of the Order of the Garter and Knight Grand Cross of the Victorian Order. His birth certificate will not be changed and the title change will not apply retrospectively.To remove the titles, the King will send Royal warrants to the Lord Chancellor, David Lammy. On 17 October, Andrew said he would stop using the titles because the “continued accusations about me distract from the work of His Majesty and the Royal Family”. “I vigorously deny the accusations against me,” he said.Princess Eugenie and Princess Beatrice will retain their titles, as they are the daughters of the son of a Sovereign. This is in line with King George V’s Letters Patent of 1917. Until this month, Ferguson kept the title Sarah, Duchess of York, but she reverted to her maiden name of Ferguson after Andrew was stripped of his Duke of York title.","Buckingham Palace announced that Prince Andrew would lose his prince title and vacate Royal Lodge in Windsor.

Prince Andrew’s Royal Lodge Lease Sparks U.K. Parliament Probe

1. Farewell to fancy outfits

2. Scrapping old ceremonial roles

3. Ending bowing and curtseying

4. Less house-hopping

5. Goodbye to gold-embossed stationery





Royal robes, swan keepers, and gold-embossed letters may soon be relics of the past if Prince William has his way. The future king is quietly sketching plans to modernise the monarchy, trimming away its “ridiculous” and “totally outdated” traditions to make the royal family more relatable to ordinary Britons. He has made it clear that he wants to lead “a monarchy fit for the modern age”, one with less pomp, fewer old-fashioned titles, and a stronger focus on purpose and people, according to Cosmopolitan.Speaking recently to actor Eugene Levy on, the Prince of Wales shared that “change for good” is on his “agenda.” He said, “I embrace that. I don’t fear it – that’s the bit that excites me, the idea of being able to bring some change. Not overly radical, but changes that I think need to happen.”His comments sparked curiosity about what exactly those changes might be.“William’s vision is a monarchy fit for the modern age – less pomp, fewer outdated titles, and a stronger emphasis on purpose,” a palace insider told. “He’s pragmatic about it. He knows the monarchy can only endure if it evolves and stays meaningful to people’s lives.One of the biggest changes William is said to favour involves the ceremonial outfits worn by royals during events such as the Order of the Garter.The insider said, “William can’t stand the more theatrical side of royal tradition.” They added that he finds parading around in velvet robes “medieval.”“William’s focus is on celebrating achievement, not ceremony. He wants the spotlight on those receiving honours, not on the royals in elaborate outfits,” the source said.William also reportedly wants to streamline centuries-old ceremonial roles that no longer serve a practical purpose. These include positions such as the Keeper of the Swans or the Yeoman of the Glass Pantry.“Some of these ceremonial positions haven’t had a real purpose in centuries,” the insider explained. “William values history, but he’s practical. He wants the royal household to operate smoothly – not to preserve traditions just for show.”Another royal protocol that could soon vanish is the long-standing practice of bowing and curtseying before members of the royal family. “William’s never been comfortable with all the bowing and curtsying,” said the insider. “He’d rather someone greet him naturally than follow old protocols.”According to the source, this shift is part of his plan to make the monarchy feel more “approachable and human.”Unlike his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, and father, King Charles, William does not plan to constantly move between royal estates. “William isn’t drawn to the idea of rotating between royal estates,” the insider said. “Windsor will be the home base, with Sandringham and Balmoral reserved for short stays.” The move, they added, reflects his wish for “stability for his family, not a life spent packing and unpacking. ”William is also modernising communication within his household. Rather than relying on traditional stationery or monogrammed notes, he reportedly prefers using digital tools. “He’s practical – he wants systems that function smoothly, not trappings designed to impress,” the insider shared, noting that he already uses WhatsApp to communicate with his staff.","Prince William has said he wants to make the royal family more relatable to ordinary Britons.

"Viral on Instagram: Germany just made citizenship harder for migrants, ending its fast-track program",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/viral-on-instagram-germany-just-made-citizenship-harder-for-migrants-ending-its-fast-track-program/articleshow/124950752.cms,"What was Germany’s fast-track citizenship program?

Advanced German language proficiency (C1 level)

Proven professional success and financial stability

Evidence of community engagement, such as volunteering

This policy also came alongside a broader reform that reduced the general residency requirement for citizenship from eight to five years and permitted dual citizenship.

'DON'T TEST OUR PATIENCE': Russia's Chilling Threat To Key EU State Amid Nuke Drone, Missile Tests

Why did Germany end the fast-track option?

Chancellor Friedrich Merz’s centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) argued the system undermined the value of German citizenship.

Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt stated that the German passport should “symbolise successful integration, not serve as a lure for unlawful immigration.”

The motion to abolish the program was supported not only by the CDU but also by the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD)—a party known for its tough anti-immigration rhetoric.

Supporters of the repeal say citizenship should reflect long-term cultural, social, and economic integration, not short-term professional success.

Critics say it sends the wrong message

What it means for people planning to move to Germany

Five years of continuous residence for most applicants

Exceptional cases (e.g., marriage to a German citizen or recognised refugee status) may still qualify sooner

This means that foreign professionals will now need to demonstrate sustained residence, employment, and social integration over several years before becoming eligible for a German passport.

The emphasis has shifted from speed to stability: Berlin wants new citizens who are linguistically fluent, socially integrated, and economically secure.



The bigger picture: Europe’s changing immigration mood







Germany has officially scrapped its fast-track citizenship program, a move that has stirred debate across Europe and gone viral on social media. Introduced in 2024 to attract highly skilled professionals, the program allowed qualified foreign nationals to apply for citizenship after just three years of residency—instead of the usual five. But after drawing fewer than 1,000 applicants and facing strong political resistance, Chancellor Friedrich Merz’s government voted in early October 2025 to end the scheme. The decision marks a major shift in Germany’s immigration stance, emphasising “integration over incentives.”The fast-track route, part of a 2024 reform under the previous government, aimed to lure top global talent—especially skilled workers in engineering, IT, and healthcare.Applicants could qualify for German citizenship after three years if they met strict criteria:Immigration experts and business groups have criticised the move, warning it could discourage skilled professionals from choosing Germany at a time when the country faces severe labour shortages in key sectors.They argue the decision projects an image of closed doors and political conservatism, particularly when Germany competes with countries like Canada and Australia, which are simplifying immigration pathways for qualified workers.Some critics also point out that the fast-track scheme had strict safeguards to ensure only well-integrated individuals benefited—making its repeal more symbolic than practical.For migrants considering a move to Germany, the citizenship timeline is now uniform:Germany’s decision reflects a broader European shift toward tighter immigration controls and renewed focus on cultural cohesion.While some EU countries are simplifying work visa systems to attract talent, others—like Germany under Merz—are prioritising long-term integration over fast access to citizenship.For many migrants dreaming of settling in Europe’s largest economy, the message is clear:Getting a German passport will take time, effort, and deep commitment—not just professional success.","Germany has officially scrapped its fast-track citizenship program.

Frankenburg to the rescue?



'Everybody and their mom has a drone startup'



Battle-tested in Ukraine?



'Decisive advantage'







What would happen if Russia sent hundreds of drones at once into Nato airspace?This nightly reality in Russia's war in Ukraine is a scenario the EU and Nato is scrambling to prepare for after last month's airspace incursions by Russia and alleged espionage across Europe.Tomas Jermalavicius, a researcher at the International Center for Defense and Security in Tallinn, Estonia, says Nato radars often don't see incoming drones because ""they fly too low.""""And we are also quite short on means to shoot them down that have a proportionate cost-benefit balance,"" he told DW.Jermalavicius noted that the shooting down of Russian drones over Polish airspace on September 9 was a case in point, because missiles costing half a million dollars were used against drones that cost no more than $50,000 (€42,930).A closeup picture of Tomas JermalaviciusMilitary experts worry that this unsustainable ""cost to kill ratio"" of expensive interceptors against cheap drones could adversely impact Nato 's air defenses in a full-scale war.To address this, Jermalavicius suggests that startups should be central to drone defense strategies, especially since drone attacks now cause up to 80% of casualties in modern warfare.""Startups are disruptors of these lazy patterns that our procurement systems and our defense industrial players settle into over decades,"" he argued, adding that they are needed as a ""thorn in the side of all these convenient arrangements"" in order to speed up developments.One of the startups promising an affordable and scalable anti-drone system is Estonia's Frankenburg Technologies based in Tallinn with offices in the UK, Ukraine, Latvia, and Lithuania.Within less than a year, Frankenburg has developed an air-defense platform prototype which company CEO Krusti Salm pitches as a solution to what he considers Nato 's ""biggest vulnerability.""""Everything that Russia launches at Ukraine and would potentially launch at European targets is by an order of magnitude cheaper than anything that we take them down with,"" he told DW.According to Salm, the aim of the project is to make the Frankenburg system ten times cheaper than existing short-range air defense interceptors like US-made Sidewinders.Frankenburg currently has one Nato country as a customer and hopes to soon start producing hundreds of interceptor missiles per week with the help of a €4 million investment in March.According to UK business daily Financial Times, startups specializing in drones and robotics have been attracting more than half of all venture capital in the European defense sector since last year.It's perhaps no surprise, then, that three of Europe's four defense startups with a so-called unicorn market valuation of more than €1 billion are drone makers among them Germany's Helsing and Quantum Systems as well as Portugal's Tekever.While Western militaries have an apparent interest in cost-effective solutions like Frankenburg's, there seems to be a certain degree of caution among traditionally rather risk-averse militaries to invest in largely unproven technologies.""[Investors and defense ministries] want to buy a complete product with proven long-term support,"" says Lithuanian Rytis Mikalauskas, CEO of the Harlequin Defense startup.Jermalavicius believes the caution is also due to the uncertainty around startups' viability. ""If I buy a lot of stuff from a startup and it goes belly up after two years, who will be the one maintaining capabilities, servicing them, providing spares, upgrading them?""Another challenge drone startups face is increasing competition, says Mikalauskas. ""There's been a running joke at defense events for over a year: 'Everybody and their mom has a drone startup,'"" he told DW.New drone startups popping up every week, it seems, also raises the question of whether the demand for drones in Europe is enough to quench the thirst to supply them?The German military, for example, aims to secure a measly 8,300 drone systems by the end of the decade — far fewer than other Nato countries.But Kaspar Gering, co-founder of DarkStar, thinks the concern is unfounded. The military-tech venture capital fund aims to bring together expertise from unicorn founders, military veterans, investors, and technical leaders.""Estonia has a €400 million, multi-year tender for loitering munition that includes specific types of drones,"" Gering told DW. ""And drone-related tenders are trending upward across the EU.""Countries on Nato 's eastern flank like Estonia have started to tap startups including Frankenburg to help build out a so-called drone wall. The EU initiative is expected to consist of radars, acoustic sensors, mobile cameras, jammers and drone interceptors.Frankenburg and many other Western startups also have established links to Ukrainian frontline units, allowing them to respond more quickly and accurately to constantly changing warfare than long-established defense companies and startups without those ties.Frankenburg's interceptor missiles, says Salm, ""don't have a single aspect that hasn't been influenced by battlefield information from Ukraine.""This kind of unfettered access is what separates the wheat from the chaff, says ICDS's Jermalavicius.""Ukrainians sit on a mountain of data gathered from drone operations, but they usually don't share it with foreign defense tech companies due to martial law restrictions,"" he said. ""So without close connections to military units, the question is to what extent the foreign products can properly reflect battlefield realities.""European startups' ability to make a difference in fending off potential Russian drone attacks also hinges on EU governments slashing bureaucracy and providing the legal framework for warfare already during peacetime, says Misha Rudominski, who co-founded Himera in 2022, a Ukrainian defense-tech startup which manufactures electronic warfare-resistant, secure tactical communication systems.""At the beginning of the full-scale invasion, we had to overlook several restrictive laws that were holding back the development of innovative defense solutions,"" the 25-year-old says, calling on Nato countries to have ""a set of laws ready for when the fighting starts to avoid their weapons being limited in functionality.""The head of Estonia's new Force Transformation Command, Ivo Peets, meanwhile, thinks the value of drone startups lies in bringing a specific ability to bear.""Their niche capability can be an advantage, even a decisive one,"" Peets, a former platoon commander who served in Afghanistan told DW.However, this advantage will eventually ""go away because the battlefield needs change,"" he added, or the capability will become so effective that ""everyone adopts it, and it will be mass produced,"" which would likely not be done by a startup.",Estonia's Frankenburg Technologies has developed an affordable and scalable anti-drone system.

FULL: Trump ‘Buries The Hatchet’ With Xi; Hints At ‘Great Meeting’ At Seoul Summit Amid Tariff War





US President Donald Trump’s week-long three-nation trip to Asia is generating comedic gold dust for late-night commentators and social media trolls in America even as his MAGA minions maintain that he is crushing it with his diplomatic masterstrokes.US trade agreements with Malaysia, Japan, and South Korea took a backseat to visuals of Trump bumbling around “like a grandpa lost in a mall” during a reception in Japan, an event that critics and comedians feasted on. The US President’s habitual word salads, including rambling digressions on his beef against magnets, his preference for steam engines over electric, and his incessant boasts on “solving” numerous wars, was cannon-fodder for comics while the White House put its best spin on the visit considered crucial to maintain US primacy.Malaysia, Japan, and South Korea reiterated commitments of more than $ 1 trillion in investments in the US, but what caught the eye of the American commentariat for the most part was the abject flattery from leaders of the three East Asian countries as they bowed and scraped before Trump to obtain low tariffs and maintain access to the US market that he has threatened to shut off unless they pony up tributes to the US by way of investments and buying American goods.South Korea presented Trump with a gold medal representing the Grand Order of Mugunghwa, the country's highest honor, and an exhibition of six ancient Silla Dynasty gold crowns—artifacts signifying the ""king’s heavenly mandate""—specially assembled for the event, a gesture critics noted could be seen as overly deferential amid US domestic ""No Kings"" protests. A band played Trump’s campaign anthem, ""YMCA,"" upon his arrival and a special lunch menu featured US-raised beef and a gold-adorned brownie, in deference to the US President’s obsession with the gold motifs and gilded accents.Earlier, Japan’s new prime minister also had a thick overlay of gold on the visit, presenting Trump with a gold-leaf golf ball, part of a golf-themed gift package that included a putter once owned by the late Prime Minister Shinzo Abe (Trump's former golfing buddy) and a golf bag signed by Japanese Masters champion Hideki Matsuyama. Reporters were directed past a gold-hued Ford F-150 pickup truck outside their meeting venue, a visible acknowledgment of Trump's desire for Japan to buy more US vehicles.In the case of South Korea, home to corporate business giants like Samsung, Hyundai and LG, Trump is said to have demanded an upfront payment of $ 350 million in cash for US in lieu of the investments it had pledged over a longer time period, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal. Seoul fended off the demand, agreeing to $200 billion in cash installments and $150 billion in shipbuilding cooperation, it said, citing Kim Yong-beom, South Korea’s presidential chief of staff for policy.In the case of Japan, the country’s new prime minister reaffirmed and advanced a prior $550 billion investment commitment made by her predecessor, signing a Framework Agreement that will direct $ 400 billion into promoting US leadership in advanced technology such as AI and quantum computing, besides $ 100 billion for nuclear power projects, increased US LNG purchases, and pipeline infrastructure.Comedians took a dim view of the booty as they mocked visuals of Trump dancing at a welcome ceremony in Malaysia and before US troops in Japan. ""Japan's throwing $550 billion at US factories, Malaysia's dropping $70 billion—Trump's turning Asia into his personal GoFundMe for 'Make America Build Again.' Who needs taxes when you've got tariffs and tango?"" sneered Jimmy Kimmel.The US President talked up his triumph though, leaving little doubt that he was setting the stage for a larger agenda on Thursday. ""Bringing back Trillions of Dollars to USA! A great trip. Dealing with very smart, talented, and wonderful Leaders. Tomorrow, President Xi of China. It will be a great meeting for both!!!"" he posted on X.","Malaysia, Japan, and South Korea reiterated commitments of more than $ 1 trillion in investments in the US. The US President’s habitual word salads, including rambling digressions on his beef against magnets, his preference for steam engines over electric, was cannon-fodder for comics.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124911313,imgsize-967031,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"
