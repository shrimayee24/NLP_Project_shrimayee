"MGNREGA to oppn’s principal issue, could trigger stormy budget session",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mgnrega-to-oppns-principal-issue-could-trigger-stormy-budget-session/articleshow/127756139.cms,"NEW DELHI: MGNREGA will be the opposition’s principal issue to target the Modi govt during the budget session of Parliament, with its demand for the rural job scheme’s restoration likely to trigger stormy exchanges in both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha.Opposition INDIA bloc, which held a coordination meeting in the chamber of Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge on Wednesday ahead of the start of the session, also decided to fully participate in the session which includes the Union budget and the Motion of Thanks to the President’s joint address. The special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls is another issue on the opposition’s agenda.In the strategy discussions, attended by Rahul Gandhi, DMK’s TR Baalu, RSP’s NK Premachandran, Shiv Sena (UBT)’s Arvind Sawant, SP’s Javed Ali Khan, CPM’s John Brittas, CPI’s P Sandosh, Congress’s KC Venugopal, Kodikunnil Suresh, Manickam Tagore, RJD’s Prem Chand Gupta, among others, the leaders decided to mark their protest over the job scheme as President Droupadi Murmu in her address to the joint sitting of Parliament on Wednesday mentioned VB-GRAMG that will replace MGNREGA. TMC did not attend the discussions.When the President’s speech mentioned the VB-GRAMG scheme, opposition MPs stood up and raised slogans. While the action riled the govt into slamming the opposition, Congress’s Jairam Ramesh said, “Today during the President’s address, all opposition parties most respectfully and in a dignified manner protested the bulldozed repeal of MGNREGA. The opposition will use all democratic means to demand the restoration of MGNREGA.If the statement made clear the opposition’s intent to make the job scheme the front and centre of its parliamentary agenda, the same scenes may be witnessed during the presentation of the Union budget.The reason behind the focus on MGNREGA seems to be the upcoming five assembly elections and the unanimity among the parties on the issue. The belief among the opposition parties is that the disbanding of the job scheme poses a serious threat to the availability of distress employment for the poor in the future because of the shifting of a considerable financial burden on the states under VB-GRAMG.Since the subject would automatically become part of the discussion on the Union budget and then also figure in debate on the motion of thanks, it would provide ample opportunity to the rivals to amplify concerns and target BJP.However, there is some uncertainty in the INDIA bloc over its decision to focus on MGNREGA and to participate in the session, in view of what TMC may do after it comes to Parliament in the coming days, after the initial absence. The Mamata Banerjee outfit has in the past forced the hands of other allies with independent action.",MGNREGA will be the opposition’s principal issue to target the Modi govt during the budget session of Parliament.

Bangladesh Leader’s Seven Sisters Remark Triggers Diplomatic Row, India Summons Envoy Issues Warning

Dhaka: Days after India advised family members of Indian diplomats and officials to return amid threat of violence against Indian establishments in Bangladesh, Dhaka on Wednesday shrugged off New Delhi’s concerns, saying it is their “choice” and “not our concern”. “If they want to take their families back, it is not our concern. There is no security concern. I do not understand what signal is being sent. It is their decision,” Bangladesh foreign affairs adviser Md Touhid Hossain said.The advisory was issued last week following massive anti-India protests near the Indian high commission in Dhaka and assistant high commissions in other cities — angry protests had come precariously close to the diplomatic facility in Chittagong — as well as a series of attacks on minority Hindus, including killings, since the death of radical Islamist leader and India-baiter Sharif Osman Hadi on Dec 18, six days after he was shot.“There is no situation in the country that would compel diplomats to send their family members back home or where officials or their family members are in danger,” Touhid said, adding he sees “no justification for the reported non-family posting of Indian diplomats”. He told reporters that the Bangladesh govt has not been informed of any security concerns regarding the family members of Indian diplomats.While the Bangladesh high commission in New Delhi and its missions have suspended visa operations, the Indian high commission in Dhaka and its missions continue to remain open.","India advised family members of Indian diplomats and officials to return amid threat of violence against Indian establishments in Bangladesh.

Delhi High Court Demands DGCA Response on Pilot Duty Regulations Amid Safety Concerns,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-high-court-demands-dgca-response-on-pilot-duty-regulations-amid-safety-concerns/articleshow/127745995.cms,".

New Delhi: Concerns about public safety due to non-implementation of DGCA regulations to prevent pilot fatigue could not be “brushed aside”, Delhi high court said Wednesday, and sought the aviation regulator’s stand on a plea challenging its decision to keep in abeyance the revised Flight Duty Time Limitation (FDTL) norms.FDTL regulations prescribe minimum rest periods for pilots and flight crew members and aim to strengthen fatigue management to ensure passenger safety.Hearing a PIL against DGCA’s move to pause implementation of the revised FDTL norms till Feb 10 in the wake of a massive disruption in IndiGo operations, a bench of Chief Justice D K Upadhyaya and Justice Tejas Karia orally remarked: “It has a direct link to the safety of passengers. Unless the regulations are challenged, or there is some flaw, they need to enforce it. The regulations were in force for a long time, but they were not being followed. We are not considering the rationale of the regulations. When regulations are in force, they are to be implemented until revised.”The bench listed the matter for hearing on Thursday and asked the DGCA counsel to seek instructions.The PIL submitted that IndiGo had cancelled hundreds of flights across the country in the first week of Dec 2025, as the airline was not adequately prepared to implement the new flight-duty norms for pilots.On Dec 5, DGCA eased the regulations — by allowing the substitution of leave with a weekly rest period — to enable IndiGo to have more pilots on duty to normalise operations.The petitioner alleged that the relaxation was illegally given by DGCA only to IndiGo, and was prima facie mala fide. The court, however, said the relaxation was applicable to all airlines.When the counsel for IndiGo questioned the locus of the petitioner, Sabari Roy, the HC dismissed it saying she was a former aircraft engineer and the issue had a bearing on public safety.“She worked as an aircraft engineer. Her functions are directly connected with passenger safety... The concern cannot be brushed aside,” the court said, noting that once in force, the regulations must be implemented unless decided otherwise by authorities.The bench, however, acknowledged that such petitions created pressure on regulators and they sometimes succumbed to it.",The Delhi high court has sought the aviation regulator's stand on a plea challenging its decision to keep in abeyance the revised Flight Duty Time Limitation (FDTL) norms.FDTL regulations prescribe minimum rest periods for pilots and flight crew members and aim to strengthen fatigue management.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127745983,imgsize-7708,width-400,resizemode-4/screenshot-2025-05-14-220545.jpg"
Can someone convert to avail minority quota: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/can-someone-convert-to-avail-minority-quota-sc/articleshow/127744188.cms,".

New Delhi: Supreme Court suo motu decided Wednesday to examine whether a person born to upper-caste affluent parents can convert to claim minority status and, thus, become eligible for admission to a minority educational institution.A brother-sister doctor duo from an affluent village got through NEET-PG and wanted to pursue their post-graduate medical courses in a particular medical institute in UP, whose claim to be a minority institution belonging to Buddhist community has been challenged. Their counsel argued before a bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi that the UP govt was not granting minority status to the institution and hampering their admissions to the institute.Being from Haryana, CJI Kant found that the brother-sister duo belonged to the affluent Satrod Kalan village in Hisar district. He scrutinised their NEET-PG application forms and discovered that both had applied under ‘general category’, but got minority certificates from sub-divisional officer at Hisar last year after allegedly converting to Buddhism.Raising doubts over the minority certificates, the justices asked the chief secretary of Haryana to inquire into the process adopted by the SDO and dismissed the siblings’ plea.",Supreme Court suo motu decided Wednesday to examine whether a person born to upper-caste affluent parents can convert to claim minority status.

Economic Survey 2025-26: Date, Time

What is the significance of the Economic Survey?

Economic Survey 2025-2026: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is expected to table the Economic Survey ahead of her Union Budget speech. The Parliament’s Budget session began on January 28, 2026 and the first phase is expected to conclude on February 13, 2026. The Union Budget 2026 will be presented by FM Sitharaman on February 1, 2026 - likely the first time when the Budget is presented on a Sunday.Each year, the Economic Survey is closely seen by economists and policy analysts since it offers a very detailed assessment of the Indian economy’s performance over the past year, along with insights into the future growth prospects across various sectors.The Economic Survey is a very comprehensive annual economic review which is prepared by the Economic Division of the Department of Economic Affairs under the Ministry of Finance. The Economic Survey bears the name of the Chief Economic Advisor, who at present is Dr. V. Anantha Nageswaran.The Economic Survey presents an in-depth analysis of macroeconomic parameters, key fiscal and financial indicators, and forward-looking assessments. The document also serves as an important reference point, often signalling the broad policy approach and priorities that will likely shape the forthcoming Union Budget for 2026-27.The Economic Survey 2025-2026 will be tabled before Parliament on Thursday, January 29, 2026, between 11:00 AM and 12:00 PM, which will be followed by a media briefing by Chief Economic Adviser V. Anantha Nageswaran.The Economic Survey usually takes stock of key macroeconomic trends. This year it may talk about growth resilience despite global headwinds, the threat from Donald Trump’s tariffs, the impact of artificial intelligence on the job market, and the weakening of the rupee against the US dollar.The analysis in the Economic Survey also suggests fresh policy ideas to tackle economic challenges, including poverty alleviation, climate action, improvements in education, infrastructure development, and strengthening the country’s financial system.The Economic Survey was first introduced in 1950-51 as part of the Budget papers, and has since then evolved into a separate document that is tabled ahead of the Union Budget. Each year, its overarching theme draws close attention from policymakers and observers alike.The Survey contains detailed sector-wise reviews along with dedicated chapters on economic concerns.","The Economic Survey 2025-2026 will be tabled before Parliament on Thursday, January 29, 2026, between 11:00 AM and 12:00 PM.

Smithsonian museum to return 3 bronzes to India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/smithsonian-museum-to-return-3-bronzes-to-india/articleshow/127733435.cms,"Museums abroad are increasingly confronting the legacy of looted cultural heritage in their collections, and the Smithsonian's National Museum of Asian Art has become the latest institution to act. On Wednesday, the museum announced it will return three sculptures to India after rigorous research revealed the sculptures had been removed illegally from temples in Tamil Nadu The sculptures 'Shiva Nataraja' (Chola period, ca. 990), 'Somaskanda' (Chola period, 12th century) and 'Saint Sundarar with Paravai' (Vijayanagar period, 16th century) are examples of the rich artistry of South Indian bronze casting.The Indian govt has agreed to place the 'Shiva Nataraja' on long-term loan. This arrangement will allow the museum to publicly share the full story of the object's origins, removal and return. It will be on view as part of the exhibition 'The Art of Knowing in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Himalayas.'As part of a systematic review of its South Asian collections, the National Museum of Asian Art undertook a detailed investigation into the provenance of the three sculptures, scrutinizing each work's transaction history.In 2023, in collaboration with the Photo Archives of the French Institute of Pondicherry, museum researchers confirmed that the bronzes had been photographed in temples in Tamil Nadu between 1956 and 1959. The Archaeological Survey of India subsequently reviewed these findings and affirmed the sculptures had been removed in violation of Indian laws.""The National Museum of Asian Art is committed to stewarding cultural heritage responsibly and advancing transparency in our collection,"" said museum director Chase F Robinson.The Shiva Nataraja belonged to the Sri Bhava Aushadesvara Temple in Thanjavur district, where it was photographed in 1957. The bronze was later acquired by the National Museum of Asian Art from Doris Wiener Gallery in New York in 2002. A researcher at the museum determined that the Doris Wiener Gallery had provided falsified documentation to facilitate the sale to the museum. The Somaskanda and Saint Sundarar with Paravai was part of a gift of 1,000 objects. Research showed that it was from the Visvanatha Temple in Alattur village, Mannarkudi taluk, and the Saint Sundarar with Paravai at the Shiva Temple was from Veerasolapuram village, Kallakuruchchi taluk.","Sculptures were removed from temples in Tamil Nadu between 1956 and 1959.

Walked Out Of Burning Jet, Now Stranded In UK: AI171 Crash Survivor Vishwaskumar Ramesh Speaks Out

The Supreme Court on Wednesday agreed to hear a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) around the investigation of the Air India plane crash that occurred on June 12 last year. The crash of Flight AI171, which killed 260 people, is being questioned by an NGO for allegedly violating citizens' fundamental rights. The NGO claims the official probe wasn't thorough enough.Lawyer Prashant Bhushan, representing the NGO 'Safety Matters Foundation', told the court that neither the government nor the Aircraft Accident Investigation Board (AAIB) had responded to the petition. He said, ""The entire pilots association are saying there is a problem in the Boeing 787 aircraft which needs to be grounded.""The apex court is currently handling three separate petitions seeking an independent investigation. These include requests from the NGO, a law student, and Captain Sabharwal's father. The pilots' federation has specifically asked for a court-monitored inquiry led by a former Supreme Court judge. While SC agreed to hear the pleas, no date has been given yet. “SIR (hearing on pleas related to special intensive revision of electoral rolls pleas) will be over today, and we will give you a short date,” the CJI told Bhushan.Earlier, on November 13, the court had noted that the AAIB's preliminary report didn't blame Captain Sabharwal for the crash. However, the court criticised the selective publication of this report, calling it ""unfortunate and irresponsible"" as it created a misleading media narrative about pilot error.Bhushan argued that such a major accident requires a more thorough court of inquiry rather than just an AAIB investigation. The Chief Justice has promised to schedule a hearing soon, after completing the current special intensive revision of electoral rolls cases.The Boeing 787-8 aircraft, piloted by Captain Sumeet Sabharwal and co-pilot Captain Clive Kunder, crashed shortly after takeoff from Ahmedabad while heading to London's Gatwick airport. Among the victims were 169 Indians, 52 Britons, seven Portuguese, one Canadian, and 12 crew members. Only one person, British national Vishwashkumar Ramesh, survived.","The Supreme Court on Wednesday agreed to hear a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) around the investigation of the Air India plane crash that occurred on June 12 last year.

Decline of Himalayan rivers could trigger nuclear war: UK report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/decline-of-himalayan-rivers-could-trigger-nuclear-war-uk-report/articleshow/127567910.cms,"ANI file photo

LONDON: The decline of rainforests and glacier-fed rivers could lead to global competition for food and water as early as the 2030s, UK intelligence chiefs have warned, adding that the decline of Himalayan rivers will “almost certainly escalate tensions” between China, India and Pakistan, potentially leading to nuclear war The British govt report warns that ecosystem degradation is occurring across all regions and “every critical ecosystem is on a pathway to collapse”.There is a realistic possibility that some ecosystems (SE Asia coral reefs, boreal forests and the Himalayas) will start to collapse from 2030, and others (rainforests and mangroves) start to collapse from 2050, it states.“Severe degradation or collapse would drive displacement of millions, change global weather patterns, increase global food and water scarcity, and drive geopolitical competition for remaining resources,” the 14-page report said.The impacts will range from crop failures, intensified natural disasters and infectious disease outbreaks to conflict within and between states. Migration and organised crime will rise and terrorist groups will exploit political instability, it said.The report, titled “Global Biodiversity Loss, Ecosystem Collapse and National Security”, was published by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra).But TOI understands it was actually put together by the Joint Intelligence Committee, which coordinates MI5 and MI6. The report assesses how biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse impact UK national security and warns that the UK’s food security will be under threat as Britain imports 40% of its food and is not self-sufficient in fertilisers. “Both existing (plant pre-breeding, regenerative agriculture) and emerging technologies (AI, lab grown protein, insect protein) offer potential solutions,” it states.According to the UK Times newspaper, the report was due to be published last autumn but “was blocked by No. 10 for being too negative”. An “abridged version” has been published following a freedom of information request. The Times claims to have seen the “full internal version”, which states that the degradation of rainforests in the Congo and the drying up of rivers fed by the Himalayas could drive people to flee to Europe, leading to “more polarised and populist politics in the UK” and putting “additional pressure on already strained national infrastructure”.The internal version also warns of the risk of nuclear war from the decline of Himalayan rivers.“Critical ecosystems that support major global food production areas and impact global climate, water and weather cycles are the most important for UK national security. The Amazon and Congo rainforests, boreal forests, the Himalayas and Southeast Asia’s coral reefs and mangroves are particularly significant for the UK,” it states.The report notes that Britain’s large South Asian diaspora could make the UK an attractive destination for people from the region.“Countries best placed to adapt are those that invest in ecosystem protection and restoration, and resilient and efficient food systems. Restoration of some ecosystems (tropical forests) is more feasible than others (coral reefs, Himalayas),” it states.A Defra spokesperson said: “Nature underpins our security, prosperity, and resilience and understanding the threats we face from biodiversity loss is crucial to meeting them head on.”"," decline of Himalayan rivers will “almost certainly escalate tensions” between China, India and Pakistan.

He said India is moving from being a parts supplier to making military and transport aircraft.","PM Modi urges global aviation companies and investors to partner with India in aircraft manufacturing, pilot training, advanced air mobility and aircraft leasing.

Parliament Erupts As President Mentions VB-G RAM G Act, Opposition Slams Move To Replace MGNREGA

New Delhi: With acrimony between govt and opposition benches often leading to disruption in Parliament, President Droupadi Murmu on Wednesday said issues like national security and resolve for ‘Viksit Bharat’ should be beyond any differences and asked MPs from across the political divide to speak in one voice on matters of national interest.In her address to a joint sitting of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha to mark the Budget session’s start, she invoked a number of leaders, including Jawaharlal Nehru and Atal Bihari Vajpayee, identified with contesting ideologies to assert that they stood for burying differences for the country’s interest.The resolve for ‘Viksit Bharat’, India’s security, self-reliance and swadeshi were the issues over which Parliament should be unanimous as it was accepted that nothing was bigger than the nation despite difference of opinions, she said, while also invoking Mahatma Gandhi, Ram Manohar Lohia, Sardar Patel and Deen Dayal Upadhyay.Her lauding of the VB-G RAM G law, which replaces MGNREGA, saying it would eliminate corruption and boost rural development, drew protests from opposition members, who called for its rollback while BJP and its allies thumped their desks in praise of the new scheme.The opposition was also heard protesting when Murmu began her speech, prompting parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju to later accuse them of insulting revered figures she mentioned.Congress charged him with spreading lies, saying it was only demanding MGNREGA restoration. The prospect of another showdown looms large as the opposition has sought to revive debate over SIR and VB-G RAM G, with Rijiju ruling out the possibility.In her address, which is prepared by govt, Murmu lauded the governing dispensation for its firm response to Pakistan-linked terrorism with Operation Sindoor, decisive action against Maoist terror, working for the uplift of backward communities, and for ensuring that Indian economy remains the fastest growing major economy despite global challenges.“India has proved that power can be used with responsibility and wisdom. My govt sent a strong message that any terrorist attack on India will receive a firm and decisive response,” she said. Maoist terror, she noted, once affected 126 districts but had receded to eight.PM Narendra Modi described her address as inspiring, comprehensive and insightful, saying it reflected India’s remarkable development journey in recent times. “The emphasis on building a Viksit Bharat was perfectly captured, reflecting our shared aspiration of building a strong and self-reliant nation. The address also covered a wide range of themes, highlighting sustained efforts for farmers, youth, the poor and the downtrodden. It reaffirmed our collective commitment to further speed up the ‘reform express’ and the emphasis on innovation and good governance,” he said.Murmu also referred to the free trade agreement India has signed with EU, saying it would boost manufacturing and service sectors and create new employment opportunities for the youth.","President Droupadi Murmu said issues like national security and resolve for ‘Viksit Bharat’ should be beyond any differences.

New Delhi: Noting that most states have not complied with its order to take steps to remove stray dogs from premises of public institutions and implement the Animal Birth Control (ABC) Rules for vaccination and sterilisation, Supreme Court on Wednesday said these states “will get a proper dressing down”.A bench of Justices Vikram Nath, Sandeep Mehta and N V Anjaria, while going through the affidavit filed by the states, said the information provided was vague, merely an eyewash, and contained fudged figures. The court was shocked after going through Jharkhand’s affidavit which claimed that nearly 1.9 lakh dogs were sterilised in the last two months. SC pointed out that manpower and infrastructure deployed by the state could not result in sterilisation of such a large number of dogs within such a short period of time.After SC passed the order on Nov 7 last year, the Jharkhand govt took action to implement the ABC Rules, and it claimed to have sterilised “1.89 lakh dogs” in contrast to Delhi that takes a year to sterilise around one lakh dogs.“It is all fudged up figures... All states make vague statements. It is an eyewash. They will get a proper dressing down,” the bench said.Senior advocate Gaurav Agarwal, who is assisting the bench as amicus curiae, brought to the court’s notice the deficiencies in the states’ responses after examining each of the affidavits filed by them.The court was also informed that there were 1.66 lakh dog bites reported in Assam in 2024 but the state has only one dog centre. “It is astonishing. In 2024 there were 1.66 lakh bites. And, in 2025 only in Jan, there were 20,900.

New Delhi: Garima Dhruwa, a class 11 student at the Eklavya Model Residential School (EMRS) for tribal students in Kosambuda in Chhattisgarh, in her first ever trip outside of her state to Delhi, stole the limelight at a packed auditorium at Bharat Mandapam on Wednesday as she played a confident ‘sarpanch’ showcasing what a model gram sabha should offer to make grassroots democracy truly participatory.Steering the narrative as a ‘Sarpanch’, Garima as part of a team of around 30 students, brought alive a “Model Youth Gram Sabha” (MYGS) as it would unravel in a village - listening, deliberating and offering solutions.“There was no script here. We, along with our teachers shortlisted the issues affecting the villages and presented what we have experienced through everyday life in our own villages,” the humanities student who aspires to be an IAS officer told TOI on the sidelines of a programme organised by the ministry of panchayati raj where the mock gram sabha presentation received applause and much appreciation.Daughter of a teacher, Garima now feels confident of reaching out to the panchayat pradhan in her own village to take up issues that bothered her as a child. One such issue being difficulty in accessing water due to broken taps in public spaces meant for villagers.From classes 9 and 11 and having their own lived experiences of challenges in their villages, each of the girls and boys in Garima’s team played a role ranging from ‘panch’ to to the panchayat secretary and the village residents of all age groups.Far away from home, Garima and her schoolmates presented before policy makers, representatives from Panchayati Raj Institutions, teachers and youth among others in the audience the aspirations of the villages surrounding Kosambuda in Chhatisgarh and how this was the story of most villages across states.The issues ranged from a girl playing the Self Help Group member appealing to the Sabha to support her by buying the products made by women to residents calling for stepping up sanitation in the area by creating waste water channels and planting more trees around the outlets to put the run-off water to good use.The Panchayat also approved the demand for a dedicated vehicle to ferry pregnant women to the hospital that is far from the village and a fine of Rs 500 to punish those found to be using abusive language in public places. The Sarpanch and other members also reprimanded families for not sending their children to school.From the North of India another group of students - they came from Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya in Himachal Pradesh's Una drew from everyday experiences of village life to highlight how the civic, infrastructure, livelihood, social and cultural issues in villages were best solved through mutual discussion as the sense of community continues to be strong factor.A class 11 science student, Shivam Sharma who played the Sarpanch told TOI that the learnings in the process of putting together the Gram Sabha have given him a new perspective about the village he comes from and the ones that surround his school.“We drew a list of issues affecting the villages with their teachers, went out to visit the village, surveyed the space and met with the gram pradhan and then planned our own gram sabha,” shared Sharma who aspires to be a doctor. Here the roadmap that developed through the discussions included demands ranging from creating a library for children to putting solar lights. Better education, health and more avenues for livelihood were concerns raised through the course of the discussion. Interestingly, the Sarpanch and other members also discussed the transition from Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act to the new law Viksit Bharat - Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin).Both these schools - the one from Chhattisgarh among EMRS and the other from Una among JNVs that held ‘Model Youth Gram Sabha’ in their schools across states were conferred with the first prize at the national awards programme as a recognition of their work at Bharat Mandapam. Both schools were given an award money of Rs 1 crore each for development activities.Addressing the gathering, union minister of state SP Singh Baghel said that these model youth gram sabhas ""mark a paradigm shift in civic education by offering students hands-on exposure to grassroots democracy as they get to engage with Panchayati Raj Institutions, strengthen the spirit of gram swaraj and nurture leadership qualities"".Secretary, ministry of panchayati raj, Vivek Bharadwaj added that the “initiative aligns with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's vision of nurturing 1 lakh young leaders across the country” and “demonstrates how youth can contribute meaningfully to solving ground level problems”.A comprehensive compendium documenting the transformative journey of MYGS released at the programme highlighted how over 28,000 students from 619 Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas and 200 Eklavya Model Residential Schools successfully participated in simulated gram sabha and gram panchayat proceedings nationwide over the past few months.Going forward the govt plans to institutionalise the ""model youth gram sabhas"" into its scheme - the ‘Rashtriya Gram Sabha Abhiyan’ wherein the states will be asked to weave in this outreach exercise among youth in their plans for the financial year 2026-27.“With over 6.64 lakh villages housing nearly 65-70% of the population, the vitality of rural India lies in the strength of its gram sabhas. As a constitutional body under Article 243, the gram sabha embodies direct democracy, enabling every adult resident of the village to participate in governance, deliberate on development priorities, and ensure accountability of Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs),” the ministry said in a statement.It further stated that despite its critical role in rural governance, youth participation in gram sabhas remains low, largely due to limited awareness, insufficient exposure, and a lack of meaningful engagement opportunities.It was in this backdrop to encourage and cultivate civic consciousness among students, the ministry of panchayati raj, in partnership with the department of school education and literacy and the ministry of tribal affairs, conceptualised the “Model Youth Gram Sabha”.","Garima Dhruwa, a class 11 student at the Eklavya Model Residential School (EMRS) for tribal students in Kosambuda in Chhattisgarh, in her first ever trip outside of her state to Delhi.

Scrutiny of disability for govt staff should be based on 'specific suspicion': NHRC chief,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/scrutiny-of-disability-for-govt-staff-should-be-based-on-specific-suspicion-nhrc-chief/articleshow/127732473.cms,".

New Delhi: Following deliberations on human rights violations arising out of re-verification and re-assessment of certificates of govt employees with disabilities, National Human Rights Commission ( NHRC ) chairperson Justice V Ramasubramanian has suggested that such scrutiny be carried out only in cases where there is specific suspicion, instead of mass re-verification of all employees with disability.The concern emerged at a meeting of NHRC’s core group on disabilities that was chaired by Justice Ramasubramanian. The chairperson noted that, understandably, Centre’s revised advisory and SOP dated Oct 15, 2025, for handling disability verification in govt jobs and education is meant to be applied prospectively only for new applicants and not retrospectively to reassess all existing beneficiaries.He observed that applying the SOP retrospectively for all of them may have legal implications. Thus, instead of mass verification, the scrutiny should be limited to cases where there is specific suspicion.“The Commission will further deliberate upon the suggestions and inputs from different stakeholders to finalise its recommendations to the government for ensuring the protection of the rights of persons with disabilities,” an NHRC statement said.The meeting saw the suggestion being made that blanket or mass medical reassessment of all govt employees with disabilities should be prohibited.Other suggestions included adoption of UDID-based digital verification as the default mechanism, with medical reassessment only being an exception, based on clearly defined and evidence-based suspicion, and elimination of the need to re-issue certificates to employees living with irreversible disabilities.On the issue of reassessment, Rajeev Sharma, joint secretary, department of empowerment of persons with disabilities, ministry of social justice and empowerment, clarified that the primary intent of the department was to ensure due diligence at the stage of admission to higher educational institutions and recruitment for govt jobs.Dr S Govindaraj, commissioner of persons with disabilities, said that verification mechanisms must remain targeted and proportional to ensure that persons with genuine disabilities are not unnecessarily inconvenienced. He said that existing guidelines emphasise validation rather than mass reassessment.Meanwhile, secretary general, NHRC, Bharat Lal said that persons with disabilities (PwD) must be treated with respect and dignity, while ensuring safeguards are in place against misuse of legal provisions. He highlighted that re-assessment of disability can be intrusive and make people feel a loss of dignity. Although the 2016 Act increased reservation for PwD from 3% to 4%, misuse and weak social values result in persons with genuine disabilities facing hardships, he added.",The concern emerged at a meeting of NHRC’s core group on disabilities.

'Your Freedom To Aspire': PM Modi Says India-EU FTA Will Create Countless Opportunities For Youth

New Delhi: PM Narendra Modi on Wednesday said the “historic” free trade agreement (FTA) between India and the European Union in Delhi a day before is a “global gamechanger” and will open countless opportunities for lakhs of Indian youths.Addressing a gathering at the annual National Cadet Corps PM Rally at Delhi Cantt here, the PM said the entire world is looking at India's youth with a “lot of trust” and the reason behind that trust is “skill and ‘sanskar’ (culture)”. He underlined that this agreement with 27 countries will benefit Indian startups by easing access to funding and innovation ecosystems, while also boosting India’s creative economy in film, gaming, fashion, digital content, music, and design. He stated that the deal will create new opportunities for Indian youth in research, education, IT, and professional services.Modi underscored it will accelerate the Atmanirbhar Bharat campaign and strengthen the resolve of “Make in India, Make for the World”. He explained that under this agreement, tariffs on more than 99% of India’s exports will either be zero or very low, benefiting industries such as textiles, leather, gems and jewellery, footwear, engineering goods, and MSMEs.He said the deal will also bring more investment into India, leading to new engineering, electronics, chemical, pharma, and other manufacturing plants, while creating assured markets for agriculture, food processing, and fisheries, which will be a major opportunity for farmers, fishermen, and rural youth. He said this FTA directly connects India’s youth to Europe’s job market, creating opportunities especially in engineering, green technology, design, logistics, and advanced manufacturing, meaning new avenues are opening for Indian youth across 27 countries.“Before this (EU FTA), India has done FTAs with Oman, New Zealand, Britain, the UAE, Australia, and countries like Mauritius...I had addressed from the Red Fort that ‘Yahi samay hai, sahi samay hai' (this is the time, this is the right time). For the country's youth, it is a time for maximum opportunities,"" Modi said, adding, “this is not just a trade agreement. This is a new blueprint for shared prosperity”.Modi also “noted with grief that the day also brought great sorrow due to the tragic plane crash in Maharashtra this morning, which claimed the lives of Deputy CM,Shri Ajit Pawar ji and some colleagues.” He highlighted that “Ajit Dada made a significant contribution to the development of Maharashtra and the nation, especially by working to improve village life, and expressed condolences to Shri Ajit Pawar ji’s family. ” He stated that in this moment of pain, the nation stands with the families of those lost in the accident.Lauding the impressive tableau on Op Sindoor, Modi appreciated the efforts of NCC cadets during that critical moment for national security. He noted their contributions in supporting the armed forces, organising blood donation camps, and providing first-aid services.Emphasising that Op Sindoor reaffirmed India’s strength and the valour of its armed forces, Modi said it also demonstrated the advancement of indigenous weapons. He stressed that in modern warfare, the role of youth skills has increased significantly, as battles are now fought not only with tanks and guns but also in code and cloud. He warned that nations lagging in technology are weak not only in economy but also in security, and stressed that innovation by youth strengthens patriotism and contributes to national security.Modi called for a new tradition in the country, proposing that NCC, NSS, and My Young India organisation hold a grand event every Jan 25 to honour first-time voters, expressing confidence that this effort will strengthen the sense of responsibility among youth and reinforce democracy.",'Your Freedom To Aspire': PM Modi Says India-EU FTA Will Create Countless Opportunities For Youth.

Patient group seeks public scrutiny of India-EU FTA ahead of signing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/patient-group-seeks-public-scrutiny-of-india-eu-fta-ahead-of-signing/articleshow/127721979.cms,"'Your Freedom To Aspire': PM Modi Says India-EU FTA Will Create Countless Opportunities For Youth

NW DELHI: A patient advocacy group has cautioned the government over the free trade agreement (FTA) with the EU, urging it to make the full text public and place it before the Parliament for a detailed discussion, prior to its signing.The group said such scrutiny is essential to enable an informed debate on the FTA’s implications for the pharmaceutical sector. Even though the pact does not explicitly talk about patent-related provisions, it provides a high level of protection and enforcement of intellectual property (IP) rights, including copyright, trademarks, designs, trade secrets and plant variety rights.The Working Group on Access to Medicines and Treatment said `trade secrets’ could be a challenge specifically for biologics, and overall, may have implications for data exclusivity.``The govt should clarify and ensure that the final text does not include any TRIPS-plus provisions, particularly patent term extensions and data exclusivity, which would compromise the availability of affordable medicines’’, KM Gopakumar, co-convenor, Working Group on Access to Medicines and Treatment told TOI.India plays an important role as a supplier of affordable generic medicines to low- and middle-income countries.Any weakening of its patent laws or regulatory framework through FTAs risks having an impact not only on patients in India, but millions worldwide who depend on Indian generic production, the group said.The agreement clearly demonstrates that India has agreed to IP protection and enforcement standards that go beyond the minimum obligations under the WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property (TRIPS Agreement). However, notably the press release (by EU) does not mention patent related provisions, nor does it clarify whether the agreement includes controversial TRIPS-plus measures such as patent term extensions, pharmaceutical data exclusivity, or other forms of market exclusivity for medicines, he added.Earlier, when negotiations were relaunched in 2022, the European Union’s proposed IP text explicitly sought patent term extension and data exclusivity protection for pharmaceutical products. In the previous rounds of negotiations, particularly during 2007-2013, India had rejected these TRIPS-plus demands following strong opposition from civil society, patent groups, and public health advocates.``We caution against repeating the approach adopted in the FTAs with EFTA and the UK that risk having a direct or indirect impact on access to affordable medicines’’, a statement from the patient advocacy group said.Further, it is also important to note that the EU–Mercosur agreement, reflects a shift away from the inclusion of patent related TRIPS-plus provisions in FTAs. This precedent should be followed in the EU-India agreement too, it added.","The Working Group on Access to Medicines and Treatment said `trade secrets’ could be a challenge specifically for biologics, and overall, may have implications for data exclusivity.

No more gold-plated silver medals for retiring railway officials,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-more-gold-plated-silver-medals-for-retiring-railway-officials/articleshow/127721094.cms,"NEW DELHI: The railway ministry on Wednesday discontinued the practice of presenting gold-plated silver medals to retiring officials, days after allegations surfaced regarding their quality and laboratory tests found that they were made largely of copper.In a circular issued to heads of all zones and production units, the ministry said, “...it has now been decided with the approval of the President that the practice of presenting gold-plated silver medals to retiring railway officers may be discontinued. The silver medals, which are already procured/available in stock with railways, may be accounted for and suitably used for other activities, redressing their utilisation concerns. ”Though the circular did not mention any reason for the decision, officials said that there have been various concerns, including the poor quality of medals supplied by outsourced vendors and need for cost-cutting as silver has become expensive.The practice had been continuing since March 2006 when the ministry decided to present all railway employees who seek voluntary retirement or superannuate with a gold-plated silver medal weighing around 20 grams.An official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the decision addresses two issues: one of quality and second of the end of a culture which doesn’t exist in any other ministry or department. Sharing a contrasting view, another official said the national transporter could have fixed the problem and ensured that the quality of medals was not compromised.“Rather than giving the task of procurement of these medals to zones and production units, railways could have tied up with agencies like MMTC for getting them,” said the official.","The practice had been continuing since March 2006 when the ministry decided to present all railway employees who seek voluntary retirement or superannuate with a gold-plated silver medal weighing around 20 grams.

'No security threat here': Bangladesh questions India's move to recall diplomats' families,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-security-threat-here-bangladesh-questions-indias-move-to-recall-diplomats-families/articleshow/127717395.cms,".

Bangladesh on Wednesday said that there was no security situation that justified India recalling the family members of its diplomats from Dhaka. This comes after New Delhi cited precautionary safety concerns amid rising extremist activity ahead of the country’s general elections.Bangladesh’s foreign affairs Adviser Md Touhid Hossain said that there was “no reason” for such a move and maintained that foreign diplomats and their families were not facing any threat in the country.Addressing a media briefing at the foreign ministry, Hossain said, “There is no situation here that would indicate danger (for Indian diplomats).” He added that Bangladesh had not received any formal communication from India flagging specific security concerns.Calling the decision an internal matter of India, Hossain said, “It is entirely their internal matter. They (India) can ask their officials or families to leave at any time.” He added that Bangladesh had no objection if Indian diplomats chose to send their family members back. “If they want to do so, there is nothing we can do about it,” he said.Hossain, who has earlier served as Bangladesh’s deputy high commissioner in India, said he could not identify a clear reason behind the move.“Perhaps (India) they have some apprehension or want to convey a message, but I cannot identify any clear reason,” he said.India last week advised the families of its diplomats and officials posted in Bangladesh to return home, weeks before the February 12 elections, citing security concerns following increased activities of extremist elements.India has its High Commission in Dhaka and diplomatic posts in Khulna, Chattogram, Rajshahi and Sylhet.Despite the recall of family members, the five Indian diplomatic missions in Bangladesh continue to function normally. The Indian High Commission in Dhaka also hosted a reception to mark India’s Republic Day, officials said.Earlier, Indian government sources said the decision to advise dependents of mission and post officials to return to India was taken as a precautionary measure.“Given the security situation, as a precautionary measure, we have advised the dependents of mission and post officials to return to India. The mission and all posts in Bangladesh continue to remain open and operational,” an official source said, adding that the Indian mission was functioning at full strength.According to sources, the move followed recent anti-India protests that were feared could escalate. “It’s for the time being and will be reviewed later,” an official said on condition of anonymity.In India’s neighbourhood, Afghanistan remains the only posting where Indian officials are not accompanied by their families. While diplomats in Pakistan are technically allowed to take their families, they generally avoid doing so following past security advisories.","Bangladesh's foreign affairs Adviser Md Touhid Hossain said that there was “no reason’ for such a move.

Eyewitness Recounts Explosions, Fire, Chaos In NCP Chief Ajit Pawar’s Fatal Plane Crash At Baramati

Asserting that development cannot be divided based on caste, religion or region, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Wednesday said the government is committed to carrying out welfare and development works ""without bias or discrimination"".He noted that a discrimination-free approach reflects Ram Rajya (an ideal rule of just, ethical, people-centric governance as described in Ramayana)Addressing a public gathering here after inaugurating and laying the foundation of 229 development projects worth over Rs 1,052 crore, Adityanath said the state government considers the entire population of Uttar Pradesh as one family and works with the spirit of inclusive and sustainable development.""Development cannot be achieved by dividing society. It has to be pursued with a comprehensive outlook and without any discrimination, no 'mine' or 'yours', no caste, religion, language or regional bias. This discrimination-free approach alone reflects the true spirit of Ram Rajya,"" the chief minister said.The programme, marking the inauguration of the Siddharthnagar Mahotsav, was attended by Leader of Opposition in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly and Itwa MLA Mata Prasad Pandey, state minister Anil Rajbhar, Dumariaganj MP Jagdambika Pal and other public representatives.Adityanath paid tributes to Lord Buddha, describing Siddharthnagar as a sacred land that gave the world the message of compassion and harmony.He also expressed condolences over the reported death of Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar in an airplane crash and extended sympathies to the bereaved families.Calling the inaugurated projects a ""collective effort"", the chief minister said the proposals came from public representatives and were approved on merit.""We are only a medium. When justified proposals come, funds are released without discrimination,"" he said.Highlighting the transformation of Siddharthnagar, once classified as an aspirational district, Adityanath said the region earlier suffered from poor infrastructure, disease and migration. He noted that encephalitis, which had claimed lives for decades, was eliminated within a few years after 2017 through sustained efforts inspired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.""Those who lost their lives were not vote banks for us. They were part of our family, and the government fulfilled its responsibility,"" he said.The chief minister said Siddharthnagar now has improved road connectivity, including four-lane highways linking the district with neighbouring regions and Nepal, which would boost investment and employment.He added that the Shamli-Gorakhpur corridor passing through Dumariaganj, Bansi and Itwa would act as a development corridor for the area.Referring to infrastructure expansion, Adityanath cited the establishment of a medical college, the start of a nursing college, the inauguration of a women's hostel and plans for a 1,000-seat auditorium under corporate social responsibility initiatives.He also spoke about welfare schemes, saying benefits such as ration, toilets, housing under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana and Ayushman Bharat health cards must reach every poor household without discrimination.""This is the essence of 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas',"" he said.Urging farmers to diversify cropping patterns, Adityanath appealed to them to adopt a third crop in addition to the traditional two, citing examples from Kannauj, Auraiya and Kanpur Dehat where maize cultivation has yielded additional income of nearly Rs 1 lakh per acre.The chief minister also called for recognising and honouring artists, sportspersons, traders and others doing exemplary work at the local level during district festivals to foster healthy competition and positive energy.","Yogi Adityanath: Government committed to carrying out welfare and development works ""without bias or discrimination"" He noted that a discrimination-free approach reflects Ram Rajya (an ideal rule of just, ethical, people-centric governance as described in Ramayana) He also expressed condolences over the reported death of Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127714701,imgsize-849895,width-400,resizemode-4/127714701.jpg"

West Bengal SIR Brings Home A Man Presumed Dead For 28 Years In UP’s Muzaffarnagar

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday noted that additions and deletions are part of the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) conducted by the Election Commission of India (ECI), as it resumed the final hearing on a batch of 19 petitions challenging the exercise carried out in Bihar last year.“Additions and deletions are part of the electoral roll revision exercise,"" PTI quoted Chief Justice of India Surya Kant (CJI) as saying. The CJI made the remark while responding to senior advocate Kapil Sibal, who appeared for a petitioner, and alleged “mass deletions” from the final voter list.Sibal countered by arguing that annual revisions already exist and that a wholesale special revision required “strong justification,” which he stressed should be supported by data. He also argued that although the poll body has plenary powers under Article 324 to conduct elections, the determination of citizenship lies exclusively with the Union government under the Citizenship Act.“This is not an ordinary administrative decision. This judgment will decide the future course of democracy in India,” he claimed.Meanwhile, the bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi also observed that the mere possibility of forgery cannot be a ground to reject Aadhaar as one of the 12 documents used to verify a voter’s identity for electoral roll revision.“If a document is recognised by statute, it cannot be discarded merely because a private entity is involved in its issuance,"" Justice Bagchi said, referring to the UIDAI, the body that issues Aadhaar cards.He added that even passports are processed through private agencies performing public duties.The top court had commenced final arguments in the matter on August 12 last year, noting that the inclusion or exclusion of names in electoral rolls falls within the constitutional remit of the ECI.The ECI has consistently defended the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) exercise, stating that Aadhaar and voter identity cards cannot be treated as conclusive proof of citizenship. It maintains that ensuring only citizens are included in the electoral rolls is its constitutional duty, and that Aadhaar can at best be used to prevent duplication, not to establish citizenship.The commission has also denied allegations of political motive, emphasizing that deletions occurred across party lines.The hearing is expected to conclude on Thursday.","The Supreme Court noted that additions and deletions are part of the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) exercise.

Desert dust storms ferry disease-causing bacteria to the Himalayan hilltops,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/desert-dust-storms-ferry-disease-causing-bacteria-to-the-himalayan-hilltops/articleshow/127712955.cms,"Photo credit: IANS

BENGALURU: High in the Himalayas, where thin air and cold temperatures are often believed to offer natural protection against disease, an unseen traveller is arriving on the wind. A new study has found that dust storms rising from the deserts of western India are carrying airborne bacteria to Himalayan hilltops, including pathogens linked to respiratory, skin and gastrointestinal illnesses.Researchers from the Bose Institute, an autonomous body under the Department of Science and Technology (DST), traced this movement through more than two years of continuous monitoring of dust events and atmospheric samples across high-altitude sites in the eastern Himalayas. Their findings have been published in the journal “Science of the Total Environment”.Dust storms are a recurring feature of India’s arid regions, particularly during the pre-monsoon months. The study shows that as these storms rise from desert surfaces, they lift not only fine mineral particles but also bacteria attached to them. Driven by prevailing winds, the dust plumes travel hundreds of kilometres, crossing the densely populated and polluted Indo-Gangetic Plain before settling over Himalayan hilltops.Several of the airborne bacteria identified in the samples are known to be associated with respiratory and skin diseases. The findings are especially relevant for Himalayan populations, who already face heightened health vulnerability due to cold climatic conditions and hypoxia. Until now, there has been limited evidence directly linking long-range airborne microbial exposure to disease risks in high-altitude regions.The research also points to a parallel process shaping the Himalayan atmosphere. Vertical uplift from the Himalayan foothills injects locally sourced pollutants and pathogens into higher layers of the air. These local microbes then mix with long-range bacterial “travellers” arriving with desert dust, collectively altering the composition of the atmospheric bacterial community over the region.This combined effect, the researchers say, may also help explain the occurrence of gastrointestinal infections in high-altitude areas. By quantitatively demonstrating how both horizontal dust transport and vertical lifting of polluted air perturb the Himalayan atmospheric microbiome, the study adds a new biological dimension to the understanding of air pollution.Beyond its scientific contribution, the findings carry clear public health implications. Current air quality monitoring frameworks focus largely on chemical pollutants, often overlooking biological agents. The researchers argue that incorporating microbial surveillance could strengthen national health action plans and support the development of health forecasting systems, in line with the goals of Viksit Bharat by 2047.For regions long regarded as climatically pristine, the study serves as a reminder that even the highest mountain air is shaped by processes unfolding far beyond the Himalayas.","Dust storms are a recurring feature of India’s arid regions, particularly during the pre-monsoon months.

Six Sarpanches Booked in Kamareddy for Mass Killing of Stray Dogs Ahead of Elections

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday sharply criticised states for failing to comply with its directions to enhance stray dog sterilisation capacity, saying, “They are all building castles in the air. ”A bench of Justices Vikram Nath, Sandeep Mehta, and NV Anjaria made the remark while hearing the governments’ submissions on their compliance with the court’s earlier directions.“They are all building castles in the air. None of the states have given data on how many stray dog bites happened, except for Assam,” PTI quoted the bench as saying.The judges also expressed surprise over Assam’s dog bite data. “Look at the statistics of bites. It is astonishing. In 2024, there were 1.66 lakh bites. And in 2025, only in January, there were 20,900. This is shocking,” they observed.“States cannot make vague statements, and all vague averments are made on affidavits. We are going to pass strong strictures against states that make vague averments,” Justice Nath warned.The remarks followed submissions by senior advocate Gaurav Agarwal, the amicus curiae in the case, who summarised initiatives taken by different states while highlighting deficiencies.He noted that although some states have taken steps in line with the Supreme Court’s directions, there was still “a long way to go” for full compliance.The governments would need to expand animal birth control (ABC) facilities, increase sterilisation of stray dogs, set up dog pounds, fence institutional areas, and remove stray animals from roads and highways, Agarwal said.Highlighting Bihar’s initiatives, Agarwal stated that the state has 34 ABC centres where it claims 20,648 dogs have been sterilised. However, the state has not specified the daily sterilisation capacity or the period this figure covers.“The state should have done a complete audit of ABC centres. If there are more than six lakh dogs in the state, sterilisation of 20,648 dogs is totally insufficient. Ninety-one dogs are presently lodged in the pounds. The affidavit does not indicate in how many institutional areas the survey has been done to see if there are fences, boundary walls, etc.,” Agarwal submitted.Advocate Manish Kumar, appearing for Bihar, sought three months’ time, stating that the state was putting systems in place and “substantial progress” would be made in that period.The Supreme Court also heard submissions from Goa, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand, and Gujarat, and posted the matter for further hearing on Thursday.The suo motu case, initiated on July 28 last year, arose from a media report on stray dog bites leading to rabies, particularly among children in Delhi.","Justices Vikram Nath, Sandeep Mehta, and NV Anjaria made the remark while hearing the governments’ submissions on their compliance with the court’s earlier directions. “They are all building castles in the air.

Indian Army to procure US firm’s autonomous V-BAT drones,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indian-army-to-procure-us-firms-autonomous-v-bat-drones/articleshow/127695476.cms,"-

Indian Army Raises Bhairav Special Force With Over One Lakh Drone Operatives For Modern Warfare

BENGALURU: US defence technology firm Shield AI Wednesday said it has secured a contract from the Indian Army to supply its V-BAT unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) along with licences for its Hivemind autonomy software, marking a step in India’s push to field advanced autonomous military platforms.The selection — under emergency procurement — covers the procurement of V-BAT vertical take-off and landing unmanned aircraft and the integration of Shield AI’s Hivemind autonomy software into the platform. The Indian Army will also receive licences for the Hivemind software development kit, which allows armed forces and approved partners to develop and test mission-specific autonomy applications.According to Shield AI, the Hivemind system enables defence platforms to sense, decide and act autonomously in complex and contested environments. It is designed to allow unmanned systems to adapt to changing conditions, avoid threats and complete missions with minimal human input.The software kit included in the deal is intended to support sovereign development of autonomous capabilities within India, with select Indian partners expected to use it to build solutions tailored to local operational needs.“V-BAT itself is a Group 3 unmanned aircraft with a ducted-fan design and vertical take-off and landing capability, allowing it to operate without runways.With an endurance of over 12 hours and a heavy-fuel engine, it is designed for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions in difficult terrain and high-threat environments,” the firm said.Its enclosed rotor and single-engine configuration, it added, enable launch and recovery from confined locations such as ship decks, rooftops and remote forward areas. Shield AI said the system is suited to operations across India’s varied geography, from high-altitude regions to coastal areas, offering long-endurance surveillance with a lower logistical footprint compared to larger drones.The contract also builds on an existing industrial partnership in India. In Dec 2025, JSW Defence began construction of a facility for next-generation unmanned aerial systems at Maheshwaram near Hyderabad, as part of its collaboration with Shield AI.The facility is intended to support domestic manufacturing of the V-BAT and serve as a global production hub, aligning with India’s broader defence indigenisation goals.","US defence technology firm Shield AI has secured a contract from the Indian Army to supply its V-BAT unmanned aircraft systems.

UGC Equity Regulations Explained: What Exists What Changed And Why It Has Sparked Protests

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday agreed to list for hearing a plea challenging the recently notified University Grants Commission (UGC) regulations on equity in higher education, which have been criticised for adopting a non-inclusionary definition of caste-based discrimination.A bench comprising Chief Justice Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi took note of submissions made by a lawyer seeking an urgent hearing in the matter. “There is a possibility of discrimination against the general class. My case is ‘Rahul Dewan and Ors vs Union’,” the lawyer told the court. Responding to this, the Chief Justice said, “We know what is happening. Make sure defects are cured. We will list it.”The challenge pertains to the University Grants Commission (Promotion of Equity in Higher Education Institutions) Regulations, 2026, notified on January 13. The new regulations mandate all higher education institutions to constitute “equity committees” to examine complaints of discrimination and promote equity on campuses.Under the regulations, these equity committees must include members from the Other Backward Classes (OBC), Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST), persons with disabilities, and women. The 2026 regulations replace the UGC (Promotion of Equity in Higher Educational Institutions) Regulations, 2012, which were largely advisory in nature.The plea assails the regulations on the ground that caste-based discrimination has been defined strictly as discrimination against members of the SC, ST and OBC categories. It argues that by limiting the scope in this manner, the UGC has effectively denied institutional protection and grievance redressal to individuals belonging to the general or non-reserved categories who may also face harassment or bias based on their caste identity.Meanwhile, protests have been reported from various places against the new regulations, with student groups and organisations demanding their immediate rollback.",The Supreme Court agreed to list for hearing a plea challenging the recently notified University Grants Commission regulations on equity in higher education.

10 facts about Nipah Virus

NEW DELHI: The Union health ministry on Tuesday clarified that the Nipah virus situation in West Bengal is under control, with only two confirmed cases reported since December last year, even as Thailand and Nepal tightened health screening of passengers arriving from India as a precautionary measure.The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare said reports from the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) show no additional Nipah Virus Disease cases beyond the two confirmed infections.Despite the limited case count, neighbouring countries have moved to heighten vigilance. Thailand has begun screening passengers at three international airports receiving flights from West Bengal, while Nepal has initiated checks at Kathmandu airport and major land border points with India.Nipah virus is a rare but highly fatal zoonotic infection that spreads from animals to humans and through close human contact. Naturally harboured by fruit bats (flying foxes), the virus can cause symptoms ranging from fever and respiratory illness to acute encephalitis, with a case fatality rate of 40–75%. There is no specific antiviral treatment or licensed vaccine, making early detection and strict infection control critical.The World Health Organization classifies Nipah as a priority pathogen due to its epidemic potential.Following confirmation of the two cases, the Centre, in coordination with the West Bengal government, activated comprehensive containment measures, including enhanced surveillance, laboratory testing and field investigations by central and state health teams.The ministry said 196 contacts linked to the cases were identified, traced, monitored and tested, with all found asymptomatic and negative. “These measures ensured timely containment, and no further spread has been detected,” it said.Health officials stressed that the screening measures adopted by Thailand and Nepal are precautionary, reflecting global sensitivity to Nipah’s high fatality rate rather than any escalation in India.“The situation is under constant monitoring, and all necessary public health safeguards are in place,” the ministry said, urging the public and media to rely only on verified official information and avoid speculative reports.With no fresh cases detected and all contacts testing negative, authorities maintain that India’s response has been swift and effective, even as neighbouring countries err on the side of caution to prevent cross-border risk.",Nipah virus is a rare but highly fatal zoonotic infection that spreads from animals to humans.

BHUBANESWAR: Traffic may be affected on Wednesday as a farmers’ organisation, Navnirman Krushak Sangathan (NKS), has called for a statewide bandh in protest against alleged problems in paddy procurement.NKS convenor Akshay Kumar said that the bandh will not affect railways and any emergency services. However, farmers will demonstrate on roads as part of the bandh from 6 am to 2 pm while the NKS has appealed business and commercial establishments to down shutters.Akshay said apart from govt’s failure to lift paddy on time, the protest will highlight loot of people, especially farmers, in the name of installing smart meters for electricity. Besides, illogical fines on people in the name of not doing pollution under check certificates.Responding to the bandh call, BJP spokesperson Manoj Mohapatra said the protest is planned by non-farmers. “Farmers in Odisha are very happy with the Mohan Charan Majhi govt because of its pro-farmer initiatives such as Rs 800 per quintal bonus for paddy,” he said.Amiya Kumar Pattnaik, national coordinator of All India Kisan Congress, farmers’ wing of Congress, said the party will fully support the bandh call as farmers are in distress.

What the deal covers

Under the FTA, duties will be cut on 99.5% of goods exported from India to the EU, including seafood and footwear.

In return, India will reduce or eliminate tariffs on 96.6% of goods imported from the EU, including phased cuts for European carmakers and alcohol producers.

Once implemented, the pact will create a combined market of nearly 2 billion people, spanning the world’s fourth-largest economy (India) and the second-largest economic bloc (EU).

Indian apparel manufacturers and gems and jewellery exporters are among the biggest gainers, as EU duties on these products will be cut to zero.

Domestic food producers will also get preferential access to the European market.

However, Indian automakers and liquor companies are expected to face stiffer competition as lower import levies make European products cheaper.

As companies await more details, here’s a look at who stands to gain and and who may lose:

Why the deal matters

NEW DELHI: India and the European Union on Tuesday announced the conclusion of negotiations for a landmark free trade agreement (FTA), ending talks that began nearly two decades ago.The ""mother of all deals"" is India’s 19th trade agreement and is expected to significantly boost exports to the 27-nation EU bloc while reshaping competition for several domestic industries.The agreement comes at a time when global trade flows have been disrupted by high US tariffs, fragile supply chains and geopolitical tensions, including the Russia-Ukraine war.India is currently facing steep tariffs from the US, while the EU is also under threat of higher American duties.India gains immediate zero-duty access to a $263 billion European textile market. The government said tariffs on textile imports will be eliminated immediately.CareEdge Ratings called the deal ""critical"" for improving competitiveness, estimating India could raise its EU market share to 9% from 5%, adding nearly $4.5 billion in annual exports over the medium term.Textile stocks reacted sharply, with KPR Mill, Welspun Living, and Kitex Garments posting strong gains, Bloomberg reported.Tariffs on leather and footwear have been slashed to zero from 17%, opening up a $100 billion EU market for Indian exporters.The EU has granted duty-free access to Indian gems and jewellery. Kirit Bhansali, chairman of the Gem & Jewellery Export Promotion Council, said bilateral trade could double to Rs 910 billion in the next three years.""This timely pact will help Indian exporters salvage lost ground,"" he said, noting that exports to the US have fallen sharply.Indian exporters of shrimp, frozen fish and value-added seafood products will get preferential access to the EU market. Producers of tea, coffee, spices, grapes and processed food will also benefit, while safeguards remain in place for sensitive sectors like dairy and poultry.The ""mother of all deals"" comes at a critical moment for the global economy, which has been unsettled by the unpredictable trade and tariff policies of US President Donald Trump.The landmark India–EU trade pact is expected to reduce both sides’ dependence on the United States and China.Negotiations, which began nearly two decades ago, gained momentum after tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on Indian and European goods disrupted global trade flows.The Trump administration has openly criticised the agreement.Earlier, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent alleged that Europe was effectively bankrolling the Russia-Ukraine war by purchasing energy products routed through India.He argued that European countries were weakening their own security by importing refined fuel from India that originates from Russian crude oil, while Washington imposed steep tariffs on Indian exports over New Delhi’s energy ties with Moscow.""We have put 25 per cent tariffs on India for buying Russian oil. Guess what happened last week? The Europeans signed a trade deal with India,"" Bessent said.However, Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal has dismissed suggestions that US tariffs played a role in pushing the deal forward, saying, ""I don’t think we even discussed this.""India has sharply cut tariffs on European alcohol. Duties on wine have been reduced to 20%, spirits to 40% (from as high as 150%), and beer to 50%.This is expected to intensify competition for Indian liquor firms. ""It’s a negative for Indian liquormakers,"" said Karan Taurani of Elara Securities. Shares of Sula Vineyards, United Breweries, and Radico Khaitan fell after the announcement.The pact allows up to 250,000 European vehicles to enter India at preferential rates, with tariffs gradually dropping from 110% to as low as 10%. Duties on auto components will also be scrapped over 5–10 years.Shares of Mahindra & Mahindra and Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles slipped following the news.Signed after nearly two decades of negotiations, the agreement marks India’s most ambitious trade pact so far and is set to reshape supply chains, pricing power and growth prospects across sectors.""Textiles, gems and jewellery, leather, pharma, and high-tech engineering"" will benefit from the deal, Munjal Almoula, managing partner for Tax & Regulatory Advisory at BDO India told Bloomberg.India’s goods trade with the EU stood at $136.5 billion in 2024-25, making the bloc its largest trading partner.The FTA is expected to be signed later this year, following legal vetting and approval by the European Parliament.","The ""mother of all deals"" is India’s 19th trade agreement.

Deloitte Partner Says Budget Must Fix GST Gaps, Cut Costs, Boost Domestic Manufacturing

Limited Room for Tax Relief

Capital Gains and Market Participation

The Next Phase of

Tax Simplification

Administrative Reforms

Take away

(Kuldip Kumar is Partner, Mainstay Tax Advisors LLP)

As the Union Budget approaches, expectations of major tax giveaways appear muted. However, this Budget may assume significance not for dramatic announcements, but for how the Government balances growth, fiscal discipline, and reform amid a challenging economic environment.The Honourable Finance Minister faces a complex macroeconomic environment. Factors such as a weakening rupee, pressure on exports, the absence of a comprehensive US trade agreement, geopolitical tensions, and continued foreign institutional investor outflows are likely to influence policy decisions. Measures announced in this year’s Budget are therefore expected to align closely with the Government’s broader economic and reform framework.Accordingly, incentivising businesses particularly export-oriented sectors and accelerating employment generation are likely to receive focused attention in this Budget.Last year’s Budget delivered meaningful tax relief through revisions in personal income-tax slabs and enhancement of the Section 87A rebate, leaving limited headroom for further concessions.These changes were introduced under the new tax regime, while the old tax regime was left unchanged.This approach was intended to encourage taxpayers still following the old regime to transition to the simpler new tax system.For FY 2023–24, nearly 72% of taxpayers opted for the new tax regime, and this proportion is expected to increase further in the current year.Does this mean the old tax regime could be phased out entirely? Perhaps not immediately, especially since the new tax regime has also been incorporated into the Income Tax Act, 2025.However, given the continued instances of misuse and claims of incorrect deductions under the old regime, it would not be surprising if the Government eventually considers doing away with it altogether.In the 2024 Budget, the Government made significant changes to the capital gains tax regime, including revisions to holding periods and tax rates, with the objective of simplification. While some asset classes benefited, tax rates on listed securities both short-term and long-term and the Securities Transaction Tax (STT), were increased.Given the growing participation of retail investors in Indian capital markets, there is a case for reviewing these measures. While challenging from a revenue perspective, the Government could consider moderating capital gains tax rates on listed securities or enhancing the basic exemption limit for long-term capital gains, currently set at ₹1.25 lakh. Further, permitting set-off of long-term capital losses against short-term capital gains in Budget 2026 would improve tax equity and align treatment of capital assets.Fiscal Discipline Remains an Important ConsiderationThe Government is expected to adhere firmly to its fiscal consolidation path, leaving limited scope for aggressive fiscal expansion. That said, carefully calibrated policy measures particularly those aimed at stimulating consumption and job creation could strengthen growth momentum and improve tax buoyancy. As with most fiscal initiatives, the benefits of such measures are likely to become visible only after a time lag.Tax simplification remains an ongoing journey. While significant progress has been achieved through digitisation and pre-filled data, several pain points persist:Clubbing provisions continue to complicate joint ownership of assets between spouses, despite the sound financial logic behind such arrangements. Introducing an option for joint tax filing, as practiced in countries like the United States, could significantly ease compliance.Notional taxation on vacant properties is often perceived as inequitable and warrants reconsideration.TDS and TCS mechanisms, though effective for tracking transactions, frequently result in excessive deductions and cash-flow strain for taxpayers, especially where final tax liability is substantially lower.Pre-filled tax returns could be further expanded, particularly for salaried taxpayers without business income, reducing manual intervention and errors.Despite the delegation of appellate powers to Joint Commissioners, a substantial backlog of tax appeals continues to persist. Introducing clearly defined timelines and enhancing accountability would help restore taxpayer confidence.Similarly, the practice of adjusting refunds against disputed demands often for several years requires urgent reform.Refunds granted in favour of taxpayers should be released automatically, without the need for repeated follow-ups or grievances.Trust as the Cornerstone of ComplianceRecent initiatives where tax authorities proactively alert taxpayers to potential mismatches mark a positive shift towards a trust-based compliance framework. The Government has already introduced the Taxpayers’ Charter; effective enforcement of its principles on the ground would benefit both sides in improving compliance for the Government while offering peace of mind to the taxpayers.While Budget 2026 may not be about headline-grabbing tax cuts, it is likely to outline how the Government intends to navigate uncertainty, sustain growth, reinforce fiscal discipline, and deepen structural reforms.In that sense, this Budget may prove to be less about immediate relief and more about building long-term economic resilience.","The Honourable Finance Minister faces a complex macroeconomic environment.

Keeping track of bank holidays is crucial for customers to plan their finances in advance and avoid last-minute inconvenience.It is important to note that banks in India follow a combination of national and state-specific holidays, which means branch closures may vary from one state to another. Here's a list of when and where will banks remain closed for rest of January:Banks will remain shut in Tripura, Odisha and West Bengal on account of the Birthday of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, Saraswati Puja (Shree Panchami), Vir Surendrasai Jayanti and Basanta Panchami.Banks will remain closed as it is the fourth Saturday of the month. According to RBI, banks remain closed on second and fourth Saturdays of the month.Banks will remain sut nationwide, as it is a Sunday.Banks across the country will remain closed, to mark Republic Day While bank branches will not be operational on these days, customers will still be able to access a range of digital banking services.Online banking platforms, ATMs, mobile banking applications and UPI services will continue to function, allowing users to carry out fund transfers, bill payments and other routine transactions.However, services that require a physical visit to a bank branch, including large cash deposits, cheque clearances and the issuance of demand drafts, will not be available during the holidays. Account holders are therefore advised to complete such tasks in advance and rely on digital options when branches are shut.","Banks will remain shut in Tripura, Odisha and West Bengal on account of the Birthday of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose.

India-EU FTA: Will Turkish goods enter India under the newly signed trade deal?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/india-eu-fta-will-turkish-goods-enter-india-under-the-newly-signed-trade-deal/articleshow/127749117.cms,"India and the EU recently announced the conclusion of what has been touted as the “mother of all deals”, but a key question remains: will Turkey be able to reroute its goods to India under the agreement?Officials have clarified that while Indian products can move into Turkiye through Europe, Turkish goods cannot enter India under FTA terms, even if shipped via EU ports. “Our goods go into the EU, and then they can go to any country with which the EU has a customs union, but Turkiye will not get the benefit because it is not part of the EU as a territory in the FTA. So, Turkiye cannot export to India and benefit from concessions,” said one official, who did not wish to be identified.Under the EU–Turkiye Customs Union, Ankara is required to align with the EU’s common external tariff, meaning that when the EU reduces duties for an FTA partner such as India, Turkiye must extend the same tariff benefit to Indian goods.This is because of Turkiye’s position in the union arrangement with the EU, which has been in force since 1996. The arrangement allows industrial goods and processed agricultural products to move freely between the EU and Turkiye without tariffs or quotas, while requiring Turkiye to apply the EU’s common external tariff on imports from third countries. The customs union, however, does not extend to primary agriculture, services, investment, government procurement or digital trade.India and the EU announced the conclusion of negotiations for the FTA on Tuesday, with the agreement expected to be signed and implemented within the year. Under the deal, preferential market access will be provided on 96.8% of tariff lines, covering 99.5% of India’s exports by volume and 90.7% by value to the EU, which will become duty-free.Officials explained that although Turkiye must mirror EU tariff reductions for FTA partners such as India, it does not gain reciprocal access because it is not a signatory to the India-EU agreement. “Turkish goods, however, cannot use the India-EU FTA to enter India duty-free, even if they are shipped via EU ports. They remain Turkish in origin and therefore do not meet the rules of origin under India's FTA, which is signed with the EU and not with Turkiye,” said Ajay Srivastava, cofounder, Global Trade Research Initiative, as cited by ET.The clarification comes amid strained relations between New Delhi and Ankara following Turkiye’s backing of Islamabad and its condemnation of India’s strikes on terror camps in Pakistan in May under Operation Sindoor.Trade figures show that India’s exports to Turkiye declined by 14.1% to $5.71 billion in 2024–25 from $6.65 billion in the previous financial year, while imports from Turkiye fell 20.8% to around $3 billion. Turkiye accounts for about 1.3% of India’s total exports of $437 billion in 2023–24.India’s exports to Turkiye include mineral fuels and oil, electrical machinery and equipment, automobiles and parts, organic chemicals, pharmaceutical products, tanning and dyeing items, plastics and rubber, cotton, man-made fibres and filaments, and iron and steel. Imports from Turkiye comprise marble blocks and slabs, fresh apples, gold, vegetables, lime and cement, mineral oil, chemicals, natural or cultured pearls, and iron and steel.","India and the EU announced the conclusion of negotiations for the FTA on Tuesday.

As India approaches the FY27 Union Budget, expectations are centred on striking a fine balance between fiscal consolidation and sustaining economic growth. This budget is likely to be less about short-term giveaways and more about long-term opportunities emerging from higher capital expenditure (capex), strategic sectoral priorities and structural reforms. Budget 2026 could mark a defining shift in India’s fiscal framework, while laying the foundation for a durable and investment-led growth cycle in India’s evolving economic landscape.The government is expected to target a gross fiscal deficit of 4.3% of GDP in FY27, marginally lower than 4.4% in FY26. More importantly, India is moving toward using the debt-to-GDP ratio as the primary fiscal anchor, with a stated goal of reducing it to around 50% by FY31 from about 56% currently. This signals a strong commitment to discipline and aligns India with global fiscal best practices. For investors, this means limited chances of big income tax cuts or populist spending. The budget is expected to be anchored around a nominal GDP growth assumption of ~10.1%, enabling the government to support growth priorities without materially straining fiscal finances.The biggest positive from a market perspective is the continued focus on capital expenditure. The Centre's capex is expected to grow by about 10.3% YoY to nearly ₹12.4 trillion, staying close to 3.1% of GDP. Unlike earlier cycles where roads and railways dominated, this budget is likely to widen the capex net. Higher allocations are expected for defence and allied industries, power, nuclear energy, electronics manufacturing, critical minerals and select labour-intensive sectors impacted by global trade disruptions. Revenue expenditure, subsidies and non-essential spending are likely to remain tightly controlled, reinforcing the capex-led growth model.Defence is emerging as one of the strongest beneficiaries of Budget 2026. With defence capex expected to rise sharply (~15% over the planned FY26 base of ~₹1.8tn), and recent approvals by the Defence Acquisition Council already touching multi-year highs, the order pipeline looks robust. Listed players such asare well placed to benefit. The growing ecosystem of defence start-ups, drones (including agri and surveillance drones) and indigenisation under “Make in India” adds a multi-year structural tailwind.While traditional infrastructure remains important, the focus is shifting toward power, nuclear and manufacturing-linked infrastructure. Power sector reforms, grid expansion and energy transition themes continue to offer opportunities. Large diversified infrastructure players such asremain key beneficiaries of sustained public capex.Electronics manufacturing, especially mobiles and allied components, continues to stand out under the PLI framework, while newer schemes such as rare-earth magnets and critical minerals signal the next phase of industrial policy. We expect players likecould be key long –term beneficiaries.Financials are likely to gain indirectly from fiscal discipline, macro stability and steady credit growth expected under Budget 2026, as these factors support consumption and investment demand.remain key beneficiaries of both retail credit expansion and capex financing.On the public sector front, we anticipate continued evolution of the government’s disinvestment and PSU strategy, shifting from outright asset sales toward business revamps and selective stake monetization; this includes the anticipated restructuring of IDBI Bank, potential stake changes in LIC, and consolidation of smaller PSU banks to create larger, more robust entities akin to SBI and HDFC.Well-capitalised lenders such asoffer a combination of balance-sheet strength and stable growth outlook, while large private and diversified financial institutions () with strong asset quality and distribution reach remain attractive plays on the broader economic recovery.Digital technologies that integrate advanced tech into agriculture, healthcare, and related social sectors, should remain key pillars of reform-oriented allocation. The Budget is expected to focus on agri-technology, rural digital infrastructure and sustainability initiatives aimed at improving long-term productivity and market access for farmers. Investors can benefit from continued demand for digital platforms, IT services and fintech solutions driven by higher penetration and affordability. Leading names such asare well placed to ride ongoing digital transformation trends, supporting long-term earnings visibility.With the government focused on fiscal discipline and capex growth instead of tax giveaways, direct support to private consumption could be limited. However, broader GST reforms, labour reforms, digital adoption incentives and targeted PLI schemes still underpin growth in consumption-linked sectors. Infrastructure push and supply-chain incentives signal a favourable long-term backdrop for Electric Vehicle (EV) players. Our preferred picks in this segment are. Further, scalable digital businesses with robust user-base growth and improving monetization including E-commerce ecosystem players (delivery/logistics platforms) likecould be key beneficiaries of increased consumer demand.","Budget 2026 could mark a defining shift in India’s fiscal framework, while laying the foundation for a durable and investment-led growth cycle.

Sharing of life and joint wealth perspective of Annie Verret

One of the most recognized couples in the golf arena is Jordan Spieth and his wife Annie Verret Spieth, who balances in-course wins with a more normal personal life and good work off course. Jordan is one of the wealthiest golfers worldwide with his three majors and regular competition on the PGA Tour, and in the family affairs and charity, Annie, his long-term partner and supporter, is behind the scenes. The cumulative net worth of both shows their combined excellence in the field of athletics as well as their common interest in other causes outside the links.By 2026, Jordan Spieth's net worth is estimated to reach approximately $120 million, earned from tournament winnings and other sources of income, such as endorsement deals and business ventures. He has won 13 PGA Tour and three major championships (Masters and the U.S Open) in his successful career on the PGA tour and this is one of the major earnings in his career.Besides the prize money in the course, Spieth also makes more than enough by making high-profile endorsements with international companies like Under Armour, Titleist, Rolex, AT&T, NetJets, SuperStroke, and more. These collaborations have been claimed to make tens of millions of dollars over the decades and are a significant portion of his yearly earnings.In addition to playing and sponsorship, Spieth has also diversified his wealth by investing in and launching strategic ventures, such as an interest in sports media and technology businesses.Although Jordan is the breadwinner, Annie Verret Spieth plays a major role in the publicity of the couple and the common financial portrait. Annie has a business degree and has been an event coordinator of youth golf programs, such as volunteering with organizations like The First Tee of Greater Dallas. She has also participated in the Jordan Spieth Family Foundation that helps in causes including junior golf, military families, and pediatric cancer research.Annie has no individual reported net worth based on her own ventures, but her impact on the brand of the family, charity, and community involvement continues to boost the impact and lifestyle of the couple. The Spieths are predominantly based in Dallas, Texas, where they have raised their children and juggle work and family.Combined, the significant career earnings and the income from endorsements of Jordan, in addition to the joint investments and charitable activities of the couple, would put them in the eight-figure bracket.","Jordan Spieth is one of the wealthiest golfers worldwide with his three majors and regular competition on the PGA Tour.

Evidence of reuse under later rulers

What the discovery adds to Egyptian history





Archaeologists working near Luxor have identified the remains of a large royal city dating back around 3,400 years, offering a detailed look at daily life during one of ancient Egypt’s most powerful periods. The settlement was built under Pharaoh Amenhotep III and later inherited by his son Akhenaten, whose radical religious reforms reshaped Egyptian history. Found within the ancient capital of Thebes, the site includes homes, workshops, administrative buildings and burial areas, many preserved to an unusual degree. Officials described it in 2021 as the “lost golden city of Luxor”, pointing to its scale and condition rather than any single monument. The discovery adds context to a period marked by wealth, upheaval and a sudden break with long-held tradition. Artefacts, streets, ovens, seals, and walls reveal economic organisation, craft production, family routines, and governance structures fragmented across Egypt’s record. National Geographic mentions excavation revealed a dense urban area enclosed by mudbrick walls that in places rise to around nine feet. Inside, rooms were filled with everyday objects left where they were last used.Pottery vessels, tools and food remains suggested the city was active and organised, rather than ceremonial alone. Some buildings appeared domestic, while others showed signs of planning and record keeping. Archaeologists also identified streets and defined neighbourhoods, hinting at a carefully managed royal settlement rather than a temporary camp.The 18th dynasty, when Amenhotep III ruled, was characterised by powerful diplomacy, abundant resources, and large-scale construction projects. Throughout Egypt, his court supervised buildings, statues, and temples. This activity seems to have been fostered by the recently discovered city, which served as an administrative and industrial hub connected to the larger capital at Thebes. Evidence of large-scale food preparation was discovered alongside items associated with the manufacturing of glass and metal. This confirms long-held beliefs that Amenhotep III's rule was one of excess and stability, based on a sophisticated labour system.After Amenhotep III’s death, his son Akhenaten took a sharply different path. He rejected Egypt’s traditional gods in favour of a single sun deity, Aten, and moved the royal court to a new city called Akhetaten, now known as Amarna. Recent findings indicate the transition may have been gradual rather than sudden, with administration and daily life continuing smoothly for years. The discovery near Luxor suggests Akhenaten inherited a functioning and productive city, raising questions about why he chose to abandon Thebes altogether. Archaeologists believe the settlement was active during the early years of his rule, before being partially left behind as power shifted north.One of the most striking aspects of the site was the amount of material linked to ordinary labour. A bakery and kitchen complex was identified, with large ovens and storage jars. Other areas showed traces of workshops used for jewellery, metal tools and decorative objects. These findings help balance the historical record, which often focuses on kings and temples rather than workers and craftspeople. The layout suggests people lived close to where they worked, within a tightly organised royal economy.The city did not vanish immediately after Akhenaten’s reign. Archaeologists found signs that it was reused during the time of Tutankhamun, who restored traditional religion and ruled from Memphis rather than Thebes or Amarna. Objects from later periods suggested continued, though reduced, activity. Ay, who succeeded Tutankhamun, may also have made use of the site. Layers of occupation showed that parts of the settlement remained in use well into the Coptic Byzantine era before finally being covered by sand.The importance of the site lies less in spectacle and more in detail. Its preservation allows archaeologists to study how a royal city functioned at ground level. It also provides context for one of Egypt’s most dramatic political and religious shifts. Rather than viewing Akhenaten’s reforms in isolation, researchers can now place them against the backdrop of a thriving urban centre he chose to leave behind. The city near Luxor does not answer every question, but it quietly fills gaps in a long and complicated story.","Archaeologists working near Luxor have identified the remains of a large royal city dating back around 3,400 years.

Impacts of the US authorised chips, for the UAE and Saudi Arabia, on the tech and economic landscape



US Approves Advanced AI Chip Exports to UAE and Saudi Arabia, Boosting Gulf Tech





In a move that signals a major shift in global technology diplomacy, the US Commerce Department has authorised the export of advanced American semiconductor chips to state-linked AI firms in the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia . This breakthrough reflects deepening ties between Washington and Gulf tech powerhouses.Announced in November 2025 but gaining fresh attention in early 2026, the decision allows UAE’s G42 and Saudi Arabia’s Humain to purchase up to 35,000 Nvidia Blackwell-class chips each. These processors are among the most powerful that are currently available for artificial intelligence applications.The approval is part of a broader “Compute Diplomacy” strategy under the second Trump administration, which seeks to knit the Gulf into the US-led ecosystem of AI development and secure long-term partnerships in cutting-edge technology.For more than a decade, advanced semiconductors, especially those used to power AI, have been tightly controlled by export regulations in Washington, with concerns focused on preventing sensitive technology from reaching rival states or being used in ways contrary to US security interests. This latest approval indicates a significant recalibration of US export policy.The Gulf nations are now being recognised not only as oil and energy partners but as trusted hubs for large-scale compute infrastructure, capable of hosting powerful AI systems and collaborating on future digital innovation.Although the initial shipment size, 35,000 units per company, is modest compared with the roughly half-million chips needed for just one gigawatt of compute, the authorisation establishes the regulatory pathway for far larger deployments in the future.In the UAE, the approval accelerates projects such as the Stargate UAE AI campus, a massive computing hub planned in partnership with global tech firms including Oracle, Cisco, AMD and Nvidia itself. Local leaders have described the US clearance as a “pivotal moment” that confirms the UAE’s role as a secure, high-performance data centre location outside the traditional US and Asian tech corridors.Similarly, in Saudi Arabia, the state-backed AI firm Humain is preparing data centres in Riyadh and Dammam that are expected to go live in 2026 powered by US chips, a foundational step in the kingdom’s Vision 2030 strategy to diversify away from oil and into technology, digital infrastructure and AI research. International Monetary Fund regional director Jihad Azour described the chip approval as a signal that Gulf countries are serious players in the global AI race and that sustained investment in AI infrastructure could be a “game changer” for their economies.The chip authorisation also occurs amid broader geopolitical competition over AI leadership between the US and China. Washington had previously imposed stringent export controls on advanced computing hardware to prevent it from indirectly benefiting Chinese technology sectors. By contrast, the Gulf export authorisation with strict security and reporting requirements attached reflects a trust-based approach that supports US alliances and economic influence in a region of critical strategic importance.Economists and analysts argue this is part of a larger pattern. The US is pivoting to secure compute ecosystems among friendly partners, ensuring advanced AI workloads and innovation don’t become isolated in one geopolitical bloc. Gulf states, with their rapid investments and geographic advantages, contribute to a distributed global AI infrastructure that serves multiple markets.The authorisation is not just geopolitics, it is economic strategy. Middle Eastern tech sectors, once peripheral in the AI race, are now hosting some of the world’s fastest supercomputers and attracting billions in investment from multinational firms. UAE’s partnerships with major players like Nvidia and Cisco and Saudi Arabia’s planned data centres with partnerships including Qualcomm and AMD, point to a rapidly diversifying AI ecosystem in the Gulf.Gulf financial flows into AI and semiconductors also have knock-on effects in the US tech economy. UAE investors, for instance, are increasing holdings in key technology and chip companies, further intertwining the Gulf and American tech sectors. As Gulf nations expand compute infrastructure and data centre capacity, they may also become hubs for AI research, cloud services and high-performance computing, areas traditionally dominated by US, European or East Asian players.In a world where compute power is increasingly as valuable as oil, the Gulf’s evolving role as a technology partner, facilitated by chip exports from the US, may become one of the defining stories of global economic and technological realignment in the 21st century. The US chip export approval marks a strategic inflection point. It embeds the Gulf more deeply in the global AI supply chain, supports Gulf economic diversification and gives Washington a firmer foothold in regional technology development. For companies like G42 and Humain, the authorisation enables them to build world-class AI infrastructure that could attract international research and commercial partners. For the US, it means shaping AI’s future through partnerships rather than competition alone.",US Commerce Department has authorised the export of advanced American semiconductor chips to state-linked AI firms in the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job. Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public. Musk has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-96413764,imgsize-26192,width-400,resizemode-4/96413764.jpg"

But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.
