CDS lashes out at defence companies: 'Show a bit of patriotism',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cds-lashes-out-at-defence-companies-show-a-bit-of-patriotism/articleshow/125358608.cms,"Don’t Overprice Products, Deliver On Time: Gen

NEW DELHI: Flagging concerns that Indian arms companies were failing to deliver emergency procurements on time and that some of them were even inflating the extent of indigenous content in their products, Chief of Defence Staff Gen Anil Chauhan has said the armed forces expect ""a bit of nationalism and patriotism"" in industry's ""profit-driven endeavours"".""Defence reforms are not a one-way street. (Domestic) industries will have to be truthful about their indigenous capabilities to us. You cannot leave us in the lurch. When you sign a contract and don't deliver in that particular time frame, it is a capability that is being lost,"" CDS said at a USI seminar on Friday. CDS said Army had told him ""most"" of the Indian companies had ""over-promised things"" and failed to deliver in specified time-frames during 5th and 6th phases of the emergency procurements mechanism. tnnCDS said ""most"" of the Indian companies have ""over-promised things"" and failed to deliver in specified time-frames.""This is unacceptable,"" he said. The EP mechanism empowers the armed forces to fast-track contracts, each worth Rs 300 crore that have to be executed within a year, instead of following the normal long-winded procurement procedure.After EP-5 last year, which was reserved exclusively for domestic companies, the defence ministry had approved EP-6.This came following the cross-border hostilities with Pakistan during Operation Sindoor in May.It will help the Army, Indian Air Force and Navy to build as well as replenish their stockpiles of missiles and other long-range weapons, loiter and precision-guided munitions, kamikaze drones and counter-drone systems, among other weapons and ammunition, through both foreign and domestic sources.Amid allegations that many domestic companies are merely assembling systems after importing them, instead of manufacturing them, Gen Anil Chauhan said, ""A lot of industries say this (a product) is 70% indigenous, but actually, if you find out, it is not. You have to be truthful about this. Because it is related to matters of security.""The Chief of Defence Staff also criticised the overpricing of weapon systems and platforms.""You will have to be cost-competitive. Cost competitiveness is not for selling to the Indian armed forces. You have to be cost-competitive to compete in the foreign market. You can't have products which are overpriced,"" Gen Chauhan said.","Chief of Defence Staff Gen Anil Chauhan has said the armed forces expect ""a bit of nationalism and patriotism"" in industry's ""profit-driven endeavours"" CDS said Army told him ""most"" of the Indian companies had ""over-promised things"" and failed to deliver in specified time-frames.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125358665,imgsize-28648,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"
"Ignoring own orders, Supreme Court has kept case in limbo since 2018",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ignoring-own-orders-supreme-court-has-kept-case-in-limbo-since-2018/articleshow/125358475.cms,"NEW DELHI: It is a classic case of how Supreme Court does not follow its own rulings. While it has repeatedly held any stay order in criminal matters should not continue for an unduly long time, its stay order on a CBI probe into poaching of animals in Corbett Tiger Reserve (CTR) has been in operation for the last seven years.Now, the apex court has agreed to hear a plea filed by an environmentalist from Uttarakhand seeking lifting of stay to allow CBI to complete its probe which had suggested ""connivance of forest officers/officials with poachers"". Interestingly, CBI has also filed an application for vacation of order in which it mentioned the findings of a preliminary inquiry conducted by it.In this case, HC had in Sept 4, 2018 ordered a CBI probe into all poaching cases in the state in the past five years and to find out the ""complicity, involvement or collusion"" of serving forest department officials in these incidents after the court was informed that 40 tigers and 272 leopards have died in the state in the last two-and-half years. But the HC order was stayed by SC on Oct 22 of the same year, when it passed an ex-parte order on an appeal filed by a retired principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife) and chief wildlife warden of the state D S Khati.Appearing before a bench headed by CJI B R Gavai, advocate Govind Jee, representing environmentalist Atul Sati, mentioned the case and pleaded for early hearing. Agreeing with his plea, SC posted the hearing to Nov 17.The petitioner alleged HC passed the order after considering scientific reports submitted by Wildlife Institute of India and Wildlife Crime Control Bureau, and the prolonged stay has effectively stymied chances of detecting and dismantling the transnational, as well as trans state network, which was behind the poaching of tigers.Records of the case show that CBI also filed an application in 2023 for vacation of the order, and also mentioned the findings of its one-month probe before the stay order was passed by SC. The agency said it found various irregularities, including a deliberate attempt made by forest officials to cover up the death of a tiger.Referring to a case in which meat and skin of tiger and leopard were recovered, CBI said, ""During inquiry by CBI of this case, photocopy of case records, as made available by the forest department have been scrutinised and 38 persons including forest officials, private persons and accused persons have been examined. CBI inquiry suggests the connivance of forest officers/officials with poachers."" It said the guidelines issued by National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) in respect of death were not being followed in Corbett.""During inquiry, prima-facie connivance of officers/officials of forest department of Uttarakhand has emerged in some cases. Gross negligence of guidelines of NTCA by officers/officials of forest department was also seen,"" it said in its report.""It is further submitted that the direction for a preliminary inquiry by CBI was passed by HC only after perusing the entire record, including the technical reports of Wildlife Institute of India, the report of the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau, and the communication issued by the head of forest force, Uttarakhand, all of which clearly indicate accountability of senior forest officials including the petitioner (Khati) himself, and in view of transnational as well as interstate nature of network of tiger poaching involved in the matter. The order, therefore, was a reasoned judicial determination founded on cogent material and appreciating the urgency, gravity as well as geographical spread of a network of tigers poachers, aimed to eliminate/ mitigate any future threat to safety of tigers,"" the petition filed by Sati, said.",Supreme Court has agreed to hear a plea filed by an environmentalist from Uttarakhand. He is seeking lifting of stay to allow CBI to complete its probe. CBI has also filed an application for vacation of order in which it mentioned findings of a preliminary inquiry conducted by it.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125358491,imgsize-1425279,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"
"Delhi blast probe: Cops suspect highly unstable TATP, ammonium nitrate behind car explosion",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cops-suspect-highly-unstable-tatp-ammonium-nitrate-behind-car-blast/articleshow/125354421.cms,"‘Very Bleak Message To World’: South Africa Envoy Condemns Delhi Blast And Seeks Joint Action

NEW DELHI: Investigators probing Monday's Delhi blast suspect that triacetone triperoxide aka TATP could be one of the key components of the IED that was in the car that exploded on Monday evening near Red Fort. At least two-three kg ammonium nitrate and fuel oil might also have been used along with other chemicals, which would have taken the bomb's weight to 40-50kg, sources said.A large bag, presumably containing the improvised-explosive device, was kept on the rear seat of the i20 being driven by Dr Umar Un Nabi, who died in the blast, CCTV footage revealed earlier. The bag had occupied almost half of the rear seat, indicating the size of the IED. The impact of the blast was such that it was felt 50 metres underground and body parts were thrown in a 50-metre radius.Nicknamed ‘mother of satan', TATP is extremely unstable, highly sensitive to shock, heat, friction and electrostatic discharge. However, it can help build ""military-grade equivalent IED"", capable of impact amounting to almost 80% power of TNT (trinitrotoluene).If confirmed in the official detailed explosive report, which is yet to be submitted by National Security Guard and the forensics, it will add more clarity to the investigation, cops said.""It's dangerous to handle in any quantity; accidental detonation during manufacturing or transportation is common,"" said a senior security establishment officer.This would mean that bomb may not have needed a detonator and could have exploded due to heat or other factors. As an IED assembler, Umar knew this and that's why he took the car to a crowded area, said sources.Police earlier suspected that the blast might have been ""accidental"", a theory which now seems plausible in the wake of a blast at Srinagar's Nowgam police station on Friday. ""That's why there were no shrapnel or pellets at the spot though car bombs don't need them as their own parts act as shrapnels,"" said an officer.TATP's primary ""advantage"" is the ease of obtaining its precursor chemicals, acetone and hydrogen peroxide. They are easily available from common household products.Forensic experts said ammonium nitrate is an oxidiser and the main component in many industrial explosives, most famously ANFO (ammonium nitrate/fuel oil). Peroxides, especially concentrated hydrogen peroxide, are also powerful oxidisers.""Along with other things, explosives typically require a combination of a strong oxidiser and a fuel (a combustible material, often organic like fuel oil, aluminium powder or glycerine) to create a high-energy, detonable mixture,"" said an FSL officer.Researchers have even explored hybrid explosives that combine hydrogen peroxide and ammonium nitrate as the oxidising phase, along with a fuel. ""These mixtures are specifically designed to be powerful explosives, sometimes performing similarly to standard ammonium nitrate-based explosives,"" said a bomb disposal squad member. ""Mixing the oxidisers with with a fuel creates a highly energetic and potentially unstable material,"" he added.","Triacetone triperoxide aka TATP could be one of the key components of the IED that was in the car that exploded on Monday evening near Red Fort.

Judge holds 3am court at home to send laundering accused to ED custody,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/judge-holds-3am-court-at-home-to-send-laundering-accused-to-ed-custody/articleshow/125358054.cms,"Realtor running 'nationwide laundering scam', says ED

NEW DELHI: It was not the sort of work that is associated with state machinery. The court of additional sessions judge Shefali Barnala Tandon (of the Patiala House courts) was convened at her residence around 3 am on Friday to remand a person accused of money laundering, Swaraj Singh Yadav, in ED's custody.Yadav, who is the promoter of Ocean Seven Buildtech Pvt Ltd, is accused of illegally selling PM Awas Yojana flats in Gurgaon in all-cash transactions.After a daylong search, Yadav was held by the agency before midnight on Thursday. ED's move came in connection with the alleged laundering of more than Rs 222 crore of funds generated from illegal sale of apartments meant for the poor under PM Awas Yojana.These were sold at an inflated price of Rs 40-50 lakh each to new buyers by cheating the original allottees whose allotment was cancelled, with not even their deposits being refunded. The original cost of a flat was Rs 26.5 lakh.Using these funds, ED said, the accused acquired personal assets, including 500 acres at Ware village in Maharashtra, 100 acres on Pune-Alibag Road, Sai Rupa Resorts in Tirthan Valley in Himachal Pradesh and land in Boston (US), besides financial assets in the UK.""The search for the arrestee started at 6.55 am, and he has to be produced before the court within 24 hours of the search, as per the guidelines of Supreme Court and various high courts,"" the ED submitted before the judge while producing the accused ""at this odd hour"" at her residence.The legal counsel of the accused was still on his way when the court began its proceedings at 3.05 am, and by the time the hearings from both the sides concluded, it was 6.30 am. The judge remanded the accused in ED's custody till Nov 28, when he is to be produced again. Not taking a chance, the judge specifically instructed that the accused be brought before the court at 2 pm on that day.The ED accused Yadav of committing ""a nationwide money laundering scam since 2006, duping thousands of buyers in Mumbai, Jaipur, Kotputli and Gurugram"". As per FIRs registered against him with the Delhi police, an estimated Rs 222 crore of homebuyers' money was siphoned by the accused after layering them through a related ""in-house construction agency"".""The concerted and accelerated liquidation of both personal and company-held assets by arrestee Swaraj Singh Yadav in the recent past strongly indicates his intent to dispose of the proceeds of crime and escape action under provisions of law. The investigation records confirm the urgent disposal of assets and liquidation of funds in anticipation of legal action. He had already sold a flat in Jalvayu Vihar in Gurugram, 40 acres of land in Borgaon, Maharashtra, and 15 acres in Jaipur,"" the ED said.""This coincides with his wife Sunita Swaraj relocating to the US in Aug 2025,"" the agency added and brought to the notice of the court the fact that the accused had transferred huge amounts to the US via a bank account of his wife's in Bank of Baroda.With his children pursuing graduation from Trinity College, Connecticut, US, there is every possibility of his fleeing from justice, the agency said.",Swaraj Singh Yadav is the promoter of Ocean Seven Buildtech Pvt Ltd.

What trends in Bihar show

What did the exit polls say?

As trends in the Bihar assembly election results emerge, NDA alliance has taken decisive leads across the state with Mahagathbandhan trailing. However, one name that is notably absent from the numbers is Prashant Kishor ’s Jan Suraaj. Despite promises to reshape Bihar’s political landscape, the results so far show no significant traction for the party.According to latest trends, the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) sweeping elections with Mahagathbandhan lagging behind.The early picture is dominated by the two major blocs:NDA has surged past the majority mark early in the day, with both the BJP and JD(U) registering strong performances.Mahagathbandhan (MGB) trails behind, with RJD performing significantly better than alliance partner Congress — but still not matching the NDA’s spread.RJD, despite MGB trailing overall, is showing up as one of the top individual parties in several seats.Jan Suraaj, however, does not appear in the early seat charts, and its vote share — where visible — is marginal, rarely impacting the margins in competitive constituencies.The Jan Suraaj Party contested its maiden elections this month with more than 200 candidates in the fray. The party, formed by poll strategist Prashant Kishore, initially announced plans to contest all 243 seats in the Bihar Assembly.The number dipped slightly after Jan Suraaj faced defections, ‘forced’ withdrawals, and other setbacks during the nomination process.Prashant Kishor, the election strategist turned politician, set an ambitious victory target for his party in the state assembly elections. He had also stated that if his party fails to achieve this, he will consider it a personal defeat.However, all exit polls predicted a dismal performance for Prashant Kishore’s Jan Suraaj Party in the Bihar assembly elections . The maximum number of seats any pollster is willing to give to the party is five. While Kishore himself did not contest the polls, his party’s vote share numbers will determine whether they have been able to make any significant dent in the votes of either the NDA or the Mahagathbandhan.","NDA has surged past the majority mark early in the day, with both the BJP and JD(U) registering strong performances.

"After 6 years, railways reverts to earlier criteria of appointing topmost officials, recruiting personnel",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-6-years-railways-reverts-to-earlier-criteria-of-appointing-topmost-officials-recruiting-personnel/articleshow/125352755.cms,"NEW DELHI: In just about six years, the railways has come full circle and more or less returned to the earlier system, not only for recruiting officers but also for appointing its topmost officials, including the chairman and members of the railway board, as well as general managers across all zones.In the recently notified Indian Railway (Selection to Senior Posts) Rules, the ministry has specified that only officers from Indian Railway Accounts Service (IRAS) or IRMS (Accounts) will be eligible to become member (finance) and similarly only Indian Railway Traffic Service (IRTS) or IRMS (Traffic) will be member (operation and business development). Officers from Indian Railway Personnel Service (IRPS) or IRMS (personal) will be eligible for director general (HR) and members for two other highly technical areas will be selected from different railway engineering services.In Dec 2019, the Cabinet had approved the merger of eight railway services into one — Indian Railway Management Services (IRMS) — and govt had touted it as the biggest reform to end departmentalism within the railway bureaucracy.However, implementation of IRMS resulted in confusion and strong opposition from railway employees. The national transporter was unable to attract enough fresh technical manpower through the new service, forcing the railways to revert to the earlier system of recruiting railway engineers and non-technical personnel through the UPSC.Under IRMS, there was a single examination with uniform eligibility criteria for both technical and non-technical candidates. Now, there are two separate exams.“The latest notification on the selection of top-level officials for posts linked to specific services is the final signal that IRMS was conceived and approved without adequate thought,” said a senior railway official.Officials from both technical and non-technical cadres have expressed dissatisfaction with the new rules. A senior railway engineer said, “Engineering services collectively get only 2–3 posts in the board, despite having a majority presence in the organisation, whereas non-technical services get exclusive and uncontested posts. This creates unequal competition pressure.”An official from the railway traffic service added that no IRTS officer will be eligible to apply for member posts advertised in 2026 and 2027, as no officer from the service will meet the eligibility criteria. He said that the requirement of having at least two years of residual service to be appointed as a GM will be almost impossible for most non-technical officers to fulfil.What makes the selection process for GMs even more subjective is the detailed application requirement. Each eligible officer must list: the top five challenging situations faced; the top five lifetime contributions to the organisation; the top five instances of effective teamwork; the top three instances of effective leadership; and the top three systemic changes implemented during their career.","In Dec 2019, the Cabinet had approved the merger of eight railway services into one — Indian Railway Management Services (IRMS) However, implementation of IRMS resulted in confusion and strong opposition from railway employees.

NDA Sweeps Bihar, Nitish Kumar Prepares for 10th CM Oath; A Look Back at ‘Sushasan Babu’s’ Journey

NEW DELHI: The running of special trains before and during the Chhath-Bihar assembly poll period not only allowed the state’s people to celebrate their biggest festival back home but also enabled them to cast their vote — the railways playing a part in the state reporting a record voter turnout (67%), the highest since 1951.The railways has run around 2,000 special trains from different states to Bihar, out of 12,000 such festival specials. The service is scheduled till the end of this month. In addition, over three dozen unscheduled and unreserved trains from across the country to Bihar were run during Chhath and the polls. Data showed that more than 50 out of the 55 unscheduled trains were bound for Bihar.Most of these unscheduled trains originated from the Northern Railway zone, including Delhi, Chandigarh, Ludhiana, Karnal and Panipat. Some of these trains were operated just a couple of days before the two phases of the election — Nov 6 and Nov 11. Railway officials said running of both scheduled and unscheduled trains were as per norms.“Unscheduled special trains were put to service wherever there was a need for clearing increasing numbers of passengers at different stations after assessing demands. In unscheduled and unreserved trains, anyone can buy a ticket for travel,” an official said.The national transporter ran around two dozen of these unscheduled trains between Nov 3 and Nov 11. Officials claimed that the operations are as per requirement and they had announced to keep 2,000 such trains as standby for any emergency requirement. The number of scheduled special trains for the festive season in 2024 was around 7,000, and this year, nearly 70% more trains were operated for the benefit of passengers.It was also the first time when railways had announced an experimental scheme named as “Round Trip Package for the festival rush on discounted fare. Under this scheme, the booking start date was Aug 14 for onward travel between Oct 13 and Oct 26. The return journey ticket could be booked by using the connecting journey feature for the train between Nov 17 and Dec 1. A total of 21,687 round tickets for 33,950 passengers were booked under this scheme.","The railways has run around 2,000 special trains from different states to Bihar, out of 12,000 such festival specials.

Police bust international cybercrime gang siphoning bitcoins from americans through microsoft support scam,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/police-bust-international-cybercrime-gang-siphoning-bitcoins-from-americans-through-microsoft-support-scam/articleshow/125350116.cms,"-

BENGALURU: In what looks like a major syndicate of an international cybercrime network, a gang operating from the city targeted citizens in the USA and siphoned off money under the pretext of Microsoft Technical Support personnel handling the 'Federal Trade Commission'. The gang was busted. However, cops are yet to discover the number of victims and the amount lost by them.Acting on a tip-off, police teams from the special cell of the Cyber Command, along with sleuths from the Cyber Crime Police Station, Whitefield division, raided the office premises of Musk Communications located on the 6th Floor, Delta Building, Sigma Soft Tech Park, Whitefield Main Road, near Varthur Kodi. They seized computers, hard disks, laptops, mobile phones, and other electronic gadgets. Additionally, 21 staffers working in the office were arrested. They were produced before a court on Saturday evening and were taken into police custody for questioning. Equipped with a search warrant from a court, the raids were carried out on Friday and Saturday.The firm Musk Communications rented a spacious 4,500 square feet office premises from this August, police investigations revealed. “We have to question the building owner on some points.Also, the rent for this office premises runs into several lakhs for sure,” an investigating officer said.A senior police officer explained their modus operandi to STOI and said, “The miscreants deployed malicious Facebook advertisements to freeze victims’ computers, falsely claimed data compromise, and extorted money under the guise of Federal Trade Commission (FTC) violations. They ran targeted Facebook advertisement campaigns aimed at United States-based users, embedding malicious code disguised as genuine service links or security alerts,” he said, adding that “When an unsuspecting user clicked on the advertisement, the code executed and locked the system. A pop-up message then appeared, falsely claiming to be from Microsoft Global Technical Support and displaying a fake helpline number. Once victims contacted the number, the fraudsters impersonated technical support executives. They misled victims by claiming their computers were hacked, their IP addresses were compromised, and that their banking credentials and personal data were at high risk. Under the pretext of resolving the alleged hacking and 'FTC violations', the fraudsters falsely claimed that the Federal Trade Commission was involved. They coerced victims into paying for security fixes, compliance procedures, or immediate risk mitigation, collecting large sums from them,” he said.Director General of Police-Cyber Command Unit, Bengaluru, Pronab Mohanty, said they suspect miscreants of duping the victims of hundreds of crores in the form of bitcoins. According to Mohanty, they acted on a concrete tip-off about the company and its illegal activities.“The raids were carried out for two days. During the operation, 21 employees, who were actively involved in cheating foreign nationals by posing as Microsoft support technicians, were secured and arrested. Several computer systems, digital devices, mobile phones, and other electronic evidence used for committing the offence were seized.

The land deal controversy

Activist’s allegations and demand

Pawar’s defence and political response

NEW DELHI: Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on Wednesday responded to activist Anjali Damania’s demand for his resignation over an alleged Rs 300-crore land deal in Pune, saying he would “use his conscience” before making any decision.A company linked to his son, Parth Pawar is at the centre of the controversy surrounding the purchase of government-owned land in Pune’s Mundhwa area.The state government has since scrapped the deal and ordered an inquiry led by senior IAS officer Vikas Kharge.“I will use my conscience and take a decision,” Pawar told reporters in Pune when asked about Damania’s resignation demand, news agency PTI reported.The controversy involves around 40 acres of government land, reportedly valued at Rs 1,800 crore, which was sold to Amadea Enterprises LLP, a firm in which Parth Pawar holds a 99% partnership for Rs 300 crore. Following allegations of irregularities, the government cancelled the sale deed and suspended several officials.Revenue minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule confirmed that FIRs have been registered against three individuals involved in the transaction but said Parth Pawar’s name was not included, as it did not appear in the sale deed.However, the firm has been issued a notice to pay double stamp duty of Rs 42 crore to complete the cancellation process.Bawankule added that activist Anjali Damania met him on Wednesday and submitted documents related to the case.“I have told her that if she has any proofs, she can submit them to the inquiry committee,” he said, assuring that the probe would be free from interference.Anjali Damania accused Ajit Pawar of shielding his son and said a fair probe cannot happen while he remains in office, news agency United News of India (UNI) reported.“As long as Ajit Pawar is in power, a fair investigation is impossible. He must step down from both posts. Parth Pawar holds a 99% stake in the firm and yet no FIR has been registered against him,” Damania told reporters.She urged the state to register a case against Parth and ensure transparency in the inquiry.The deputy chief minister has denied any wrongdoing, calling the allegations “random accusations” raised before local body elections. He maintained that Parth was unaware the land was government-owned.“I still don’t understand how a document can be registered without even a rupee being exchanged. The truth will come out soon,” he said.He also said he had already briefed chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and welcomed the inquiry.“If anyone close to me has done something wrong, I will never support it. I have told the Chief Minister to order a probe,” Pawar said. He added that the issue was “a lesson” for his son to be more cautious in future dealings.Meanwhile, minister Bawankule reiterated that the inquiry would continue independently under ACS Vikas Kharge.Bawankule said the officer heading the inquiry is honest and that there will be no interference in the investigation.","M Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar responds to activist Anjali Damania’s demand for his resignation over an alleged Rs 300-crore land deal in Pune.

NEW DELHI: In a major booster shot for military capabilities in eastern Ladakh, India on Wednesday operationalised its new Nyoma airbase close to the frontier with China, even as a large Army exercise called 'Poorvi Prachand Prahar' is now under way in Arunachal Pradesh on the eastern front.The developments at the opposite ends of the 3,488-km LAC underscore the high military readiness being maintained along the China frontier. ""There is ongoing reset in bilateral diplomatic ties. Military CBMs are also being progressively strengthened but the trust deficit on the ground remains high,"" a senior officer told TOI. ""With no de-escalation along LAC, troops will continue to be forward deployed for 6th successive winter since multiple Chinese incursions into eastern Ladakh in April-May 2020,"" he said.IAF chief Air Chief Marshal A P Singh himself flew a C-130J 'Super Hercules' aircraft from Hindon on the outskirts of Delhi to the Mudh airfield at Nyoma, among the world's highest at an altitude of 13,710 feet, to formally inaugurate the strategically located airbase. He was accompanied by Western Air Command chief Air Marshal Jeetendra Mishra.Located just about 35 km from the LAC, Nyoma has undergone an upgrade worth Rs 230 crore, which included extending the original airstrip into a 2.7-km 'rigid pavement' runway, a new ATC complex, hangars, crash bay and accommodation, as was earlier reported by TOI.The Mudh airfield is now fully capable of handling and sustaining operations by heavy-lift transport planes and fighter jets from both directions. Primarily, it will help quickly rush troops, weapons and supplies to areas such as Pangong Tso, Demchok and Depsang in eastern Ladakh.The airfield will also be available for fighter operations by early 2026 though high altitude will be a limiting factor. China has assiduously upgraded all its airbases facing India over the last five years to offset the terrain constraints due to high-altitude and rarefied air, which limits the weapon and fuel-carrying capacity of aircraft.China now has additional fighters, including advanced J-20 stealth fighters, as well as bombers, reconnaissance aircraft and drones deployed at its airfields like Hotan, Kashgar, Gargunsa, Shigatse, Bangda, Nyingchi and Hoping. It has also built many new heliports all along the LAC.In the far reaches of the Eastern Himalayas, thousands of soldiers from the 3 Spear Corps of the Indian Army, along with elements of IAF, ITBP and others, are now also engaged in the 'Poorvi Prachand Prahar' exercise in the high-altitude terrain of Mechuka and other areas of Arunachal Pradesh.From airlift and force projection to mountain warfare manoeuvres and multi-domain integrated operations, the exercise aims at validating rapid mobilisation, operational logistics and precision-strike capabilities. ""The right force must reach the right place at the right time during conflicts,"" an officer said.While Nyoma will be another operational base for the IAF in Ladakh after Leh, Kargil and Thoise airfields and the Daulat Beg Oldie ALG (advanced landing ground), India has also progressively upgraded the infrastructure at ALGs like Pasighat, Mechuka, Walong, Tuting, Along and Ziro in Arunachal Pradesh. Similarly, civil ALGs in the middle sector (Uttarakhand, Himachal) of the LAC are also now being increasingly used for military purposes.","IAF chief Air Chief Marshal A P Singh flew a C-130J 'Super Hercules' aircraft from Hindon on the outskirts of Delhi to the Mudh airfield at Nyoma, among the world's highest at an altitude of 13,710 feet.

Inside H-1B row: How Trump’s sudden U-turns could leave America losing the talent war to foreigners,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/inside-h-1b-row-how-trumps-sudden-u-turns-could-leave-america-losing-the-talent-war-to-foreigners/articleshow/125333580.cms,"'No Talent In U.S.': Trump BURNS MAGA Base For India Reset? What It Means For Indian Workers

What are H1-B visas and who uses them



How are American jobs at risk



Supporters say the programme keeps America competitive



MAGA does not like Trump's U-turn







A heated national row over jobs, immigration and the future of the American workforce has intensified after President Donald Trump suggested that the United States “doesn’t have certain talents” earlier this week, even as the Trump Administation tightens rules around the H1-B visa programme.The GOP leader's latest comments have reignited a long-running political fight over whether foreign workers are helping American innovation or displacing American workers.The H1-B visa allows companies to hire highly skilled foreign workers in specialised fields for up to six years. It is intended for people of “exceptional merit and ability”, typically with at least a bachelor’s degree. The tech sector remains the biggest user of the programme, accounting for up to 70 percent of applications each year. Engineering, consulting, healthcare and university research also rely heavily on the visa.India dominates the applicant pool, making up 73 per cent of all H1-B visa holders, followed by China at 12 per cent, according to Fox News. Universities and non-profit research institutions are exempt from the usual annual cap of 65,000 visas, plus an additional 20,000 for applicants with advanced degrees, which means the total number of approvals is often far higher.Pew Research Center estimates around 400,000 approvals in the last year alone.Opposition to the programme spans both Republicans and Democrats. Critics argue that the system is being abused to import cheaper labour and push aside American workers.In September, Trump issued a presidential proclamation accusing the H1-B system of being “deliberately exploited to replace, rather than supplement, American workers with lower-paid, lower-skilled labour”. He said this practice “has undermined both our economic and national security”.Trump imposed a $100,000 fee on each new H1-B visa application, effective September 21. His administration is also introducing stricter definitions of “specialty occupation”, expanding compliance inspections, and requiring employers to file applications directly rather than through third-party contractors.Many business leaders warn that harsh restrictions could push talent and investment overseas. The US Chamber of Commerce has filed a lawsuit to block the new $100,000 fee, arguing it violates immigration law and would make the programme “cost-prohibitive” for small and mid-size companies.Elon Musk is among the most vocal defenders of the visa system, noting that many of the engineers who helped build Tesla and SpaceX first arrived in the United States on H1-B visas. He said, “The reason I’m in America along with so many critical people who built SpaceX, Tesla, and hundreds of other companies that made America strong is because of H1B.”Despite his own sweeping restrictions, Trump stirred a row this week by insisting that the United States still needed foreign workers because “people have to learn”. He added that “the United States doesn’t have certain talents” and warned that some highly technical defence and technology roles cannot simply be filled by “taking people off an unemployment line”.His remarks have frustrated parts of his MAGA base, who view the comment as undercutting his America First message. Others argue it reveals the core tension at the centre of the H1-B debate: the nation wants to protect American jobs, but it also fears falling behind global competitors like China, which recently launched its own talent visa known as the K visa.","The H1-B visa allows companies to hire highly skilled foreign workers in specialised fields for up to six years.

'No Talent In U.S.': Trump BURNS MAGA Base For India Reset? What It Means For Indian Workers





Vice President JD Vance spoke out on the issue of foreign workers in the US amid the ongoing H-1B row triggered by President Donald Trump's recent statement that US needs 'certain' talents from other countries. As Vance spoke to Sean Hannity, he said the Democrat model was to import more low-wage immigrants which he said hurt the jobs, wages and prosperity.Vance said the choice is between low-wage immigrants and American citizens empowered by technology. The VP said Trump's model is the second one which will pave prosperity for America.As Vance said US should avoid relying on low-wage workers and instead focus on using technology to empower the blue-collar workers, he struck a different chord with the President. Because the president said America lacks certain types of talent and cited the example of the battery plant in Georgia that was raided.“They raided because they wanted illegal immigrants out. They had people from South Korea that made batteries all their lives. You know, making batteries are very complicated. It’s not an easy thing and very dangerous,"" Trump said adding that the South Korean company had “like five or six hundred people, to make batteries and to teach people how to do it.Well, they wanted them to get out of the country. ""You're going to need that,"" Trump said when he was asked whether H-1B visa will be a big priority for his administration.H-1B visa program is for high-skilled individuals, mostly employed in tech and education sectors. But while Trump said US needs foreign workers, Vance said US does not need low-wage foreign workers.“Their (the Democrats) idea was the way that we get more prosperity is that you import more and more low-wage servants and that actually I think reduced prosperity, because it meant that a lot of our blue-collar workers were struggling. But if you use technology and you empower the blue-collar workers rather than replace them with foreign labor, I think they are going to do way better, they are going to make higher wages and the whole country is going to be better off,"" Vance said.""In other words, do you depend on low-wage immigrants or do you depend on American citizens bolstered by technology and innovation? That’s the Trump model,"" Vance added.","Vice President JD Vance spoke out on the issue of foreign workers in the US amid the ongoing H-1B row triggered by President Donald Trump's recent statement that US needs 'certain' talents from other countries.

Google has announced a $40 billion investment in Texas through 2027, marking one of its largest US infrastructure commitments to date. The funds, the company said will go toward building new cloud and AI infrastructure, including new data center campuses in Armstrong County and Haskell County. Google CEO shared an online post, announcing the investment. “Today, we're announcing a new $40B investment in Texas through 2027 to build Cloud & AI infrastructure and support thousands of new jobs,” he wrote in the post.“This includes new data centers in Armstrong and Haskell Counties and a major investment to strengthen energy resilience and abundance. We're also providing funding to more than double the projected pipeline of new Texan electricians to power the AI era,” he added.“We've proudly called Texas home for 15 years. Thank you @GregAbbott_TX for your continued support,” Pichai continued.As part of the $40 billion investment, Google said it will continue its approach of growing infrastructure responsibly, which includes adding new clean energy resources to the Texas grid and covering the costs tied to its operations. The company also announced a new $30 million Energy Impact Fund to help scale community energy-efficiency projects across the state.Google also confirmed it has secured more than 6,200 megawatts of new energy generation and capacity through power-purchase agreements with energy developers. One of the new Haskell County data centers will be built alongside a solar and battery storage plant, reinforcing the company’s push toward cleaner, more reliable energy resources.In order to support construction of the new facilities, Google will help expand Texas’ pool of skilled electrical workers. In partnership with the electrical training ALLIANCE, the company will help train existing electricians and more than 1,700 apprentices by 2030, more than doubling the state’s expected pipeline of new electricians.Google said the investment is meant not only to bolster Texas’ workforce and infrastructure, but to help ensure the U.S. maintains “the technical backbone to lead the world in AI.”","Google has announced a $40 billion investment in Texas through 2027.

Competing with SpaceX's dominance









Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin achieved a historic milestone by successfully landing its massive New Glenn rocket booster on a droneship in the Atlantic Ocean, prompting congratulations from rival SpaceX CEO Elon Musk . The successful landing marks a pivotal moment in the commercial space race, making Blue Origin only the second company after SpaceX to master the complex technology of landing orbital-class rocket boosters for reuse.“Congratulations @JeffBezos and the @BlueOrigin team!"" Musk wrote on social media in a response to Blue Origin’s announcement.In a separate post, Musk replied to a post shared by Jeff Bezos who shared a video clip of the New Glenn rocket booster landing in the middle of a platform floating in the ocean.The New Glenn booster, standing over 320 feet tall and powered by seven advanced BE-4 engines, touched down on the droneship Jacklyn just minutes after launching from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station at 3:55 PM EST. The landing followed the successful deployment of NASA's twin ESCAPADE satellites on a mission to study Mars’s atmospheric loss and solar wind interactions.“We achieved full mission success today, and I am so proud of the team. Never before in history has a booster this large nailed the landing on the second try. This is just the beginning as we rapidly scale our flight cadence and continue delivering for our customers,” said Dave Limp, Blue Origin's CEO.The achievement represents a significant breakthrough in Blue Origin's efforts to compete with SpaceX, which has long dominated the reusable rocket market with its Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy vehicles. Reusability reduces launch costs by allowing expensive first-stage boosters to be recovered, refurbished, and flown multiple times rather than discarded after a single use.Blue Origin’s New Glenn is designed for up to 25 reuses, promising to bring competitive pricing and reliability to deep space and orbital missions. The company has already secured multiple years of orders from customers including NASA, Amazon's Project Kuiper, AST SpaceMobile, and several telecommunications providers.","The New Glenn booster, standing over 320 feet tall and powered by seven advanced BE-4 engines, touched down on the droneship Jacklyn just minutes after launching from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station at 3:55 PM EST.

SEBI’s advisory in digital gold



Read SEBI’s advisory here:



SEBI has enabled investments in gold and gold related instruments through various SEBI regulated gold products. These are exchange traded commodity derivative contracts, Gold Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) offered by Mutual Funds and Electronic Gold Receipts (EGRs) tradeable on stock exchanges. Investments in these SEBI regulated gold products can be made through SEBI registered intermediaries and are governed by the regulatory framework prescribed by SEBI.

It has come to the notice of SEBI that some digital/online platforms are offering investors to invest in ""Digital Gold/E-Gold Products'. Digital Gold is being marketed as an alternative for investment in physical gold.

In this context, it is informed that such digital gold products are different from SEBI regulated gold products as they are neither notified as securities nor regulated as commodity derivatives. They operate entirely outside the purview of SEBI. Such digital gold products may entail significant risks for investors and may expose investors to counterparty and operational risks.

Investors/ participants are made aware that none of the investor protection mechaims under securities market purview shall be available for investments in such Digital Gold/ E-Gold products.





Zerodha CEO Nithin Kamath has now issued a cautionary note for the investors following SEBI’s recent advisory on digital gold. For those unaware, earlier this week SEBI issued a an advisory on digital gold calling it an unregulated and inefficient way to gain exposureto the precious metal. Now Kamath shared a post of social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) advising the users to not to go after digital gold and instead opt for the one of the safest and easiest ways — gold ETFs if they want to inset in gold. “Most people don’t realize that nobody regulates digital gold, and if something were to happen to the platforms or companies selling it, there’s not much you can do,” wrote Kamath.In a post shared on X, Kamath emphasised that digital gold is not regulated by any financial authority, which means that investors have limited recourse if the platforms selling it collapse or default. He noted that most buyers are unaware of this regulatory gap. “Most people don’t realize that nobody regulates digital gold, and if something were to happen to the platforms or companies selling it, there’s not much you can do,” Kamath wrote.Along with this, Kamath also pointed out the high upfront costs associated with digital gold purchases such as a 3% GST, plus 2–3% in spreads, which in tern means that the investors will lose another 6% immediately after buying digital gold, even before the regulatory risks kick in.Kamath also said that with Sovereign Gold Bonds going away, the only safest and easiest way to invest in gold is through gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs). “Now that Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGBs) have stopped, gold ETFs remain one of the safest and easiest ways to get exposure to gold,’ Kamath.The remarks made by Kamath align with the Securities and Exchange Board of India’s (SEBI) recent warning about the risks of investing in digital gold. SEBI cautioned that these products are not covered under its regulatory framework and urged investors to exercise due diligence.","Zerodha CEO Nithin Kamath has issued a cautionary note for the investors following SEBI’s recent advisory on digital gold.

RUDRAPUR: The much-awaited sleep clinic at Rudrapur’s Govt Medical College remains non-operational nearly a year after its completion due to the non-appointment of specialist doctors. Crores were spent on infrastructure and equipment, including a state-of-the-art telemetry video polysomnography machine, procured under the National Health Mission for Rs 52 lakh, which was meant to play a pivotal role in diagnosing and treating insomnia. However, with no dedicated doctors, the machine continues to gather dust, and the 10–15 patients who arrive at the facility every month with insomnia-related symptoms are being treated in the general OPD.Doctors say cases are rising sharply, especially among the youth, driven by excessive screen time and increasing mental stress. Dr Kedar Shahi, head of the general surgery department, said, “People today are losing sleep to digital screens,. Heavy use of mobile phones and laptops affects the nervous system, leading to digestive issues, mental health problems, and sleep disorders. Many people barely manage two to three hours of sleep, while six to seven hours of deep sleep is essential for good health.” He added that lack of sleep often results in irritability, depression, memory loss, and reduced productivity.Dr G S Titiyaal, the college’s principal, said, “The shortage of doctors has delayed the launch of the sleep clinic. The selection process has started, and we are in constant touch with senior officials. We expect the clinic to become operational within a month.”","The much-awaited sleep clinic at Rudrapur’s Govt Medical College remains non- operational nearly a year after its completion.

French department store Galeries Lafayette has officially entered India with a large five-floor store opened in Mumbai, hoping to tap into the country’s massive consumer base—but the road ahead is far from simple.Backed locally by the fashion division of the Aditya Birla Group, the retailer’s debut marks another attempt by global luxury brands to establish a firm foothold in a market long seen as promising yet difficult to navigate.As per news agency AFP, Benedicte Epinay, CEO of Comité Colbert, described the opening as “an important step,” adding that India, with its 1.4 billion population, offers a “promising” but “complicated” market.Brands not only deal with high import duties, complex bureaucracy and limited infrastructure, but must also compete with a thriving domestic luxury fashion scene.Despite the Mumbai outlet housing around 250 luxury and designer labels, almost all of them foreign, experts caution that global brands face strong cultural headwinds. “If you want something for a wedding, you’ll buy Sabyasachi or Tarun Tahiliani,” said Mumbai shopper Sonal Ahuja, questioning why buyers would choose a foreign product “trying to be Indian,” according to AFP.India’s luxury sector, valued at $11 billion in 2024, is expected to rise to $35 billion by 2030, said Estelle David of Business France.Rising incomes and thousands of new millionaire households are boosting demand for everything from Lamborghinis to Louis Vuitton bags. “India ticks all the boxes,” Epinay was quoted as saying by AFP, but she warned that reality remains “more complex.”Ashok Som of ESSEC Business School explained that brands have “very little data” showing solid profits.Most luxury houses have one to three stores in India, compared with 100 to 400 in China, Epinay pointed out.Limited premium retail spaces and high duties often push wealthy buyers to fly to Dubai, where the same luxury handbag can cost up to 40% less, as per AFP. “To say you should pay extra just to buy in India? No way,” said Mumbai entrepreneur Vishal Mathur.A proposed India–EU free trade agreement could ease some challenges by reducing tariffs, Epinay said. But success, experts believe, will depend on how well brands adapt.Traditional outfits such as kurtas and saris still dominate for special occasions, and Western wear remains a minority choice.Labels including Louboutin, Dior, Chanel and Bulgari are already collaborating with Indian designers, Bollywood personalities and influencers to connect with consumers.“You have to adapt to the culture, to tastes and consumption habits,” David said, as per AFP.",French department store Galeries Lafayette has officially entered India with a large five-floor store opened in Mumbai.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

* IT, Auto stocks shine

* Q3 results season starts

* Positive global cues

* China stocks rise

* Rupee gains

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

CEO Nadella says market expansion matters more than market share





Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella brushed off concerns about losing coding assistant market share to upstart competitors, calling the emergence of new rivals like Cursor and Claude Code a positive sign for the industry rather than an existential threat. Speaking on the Dwarkesh Podcast during a tour of Microsoft's new Fairwater 2 datacenter, Nadella responded to data showing GitHub Copilot's market share declining from nearly 100% to around 25% in just one year. ""I love this chart for so many reasons. One is we're still on the top,"" he said, noting that competitors like Cursor, Anthropic's Claude Code, and OpenAI's Codex have collectively grown the AI coding market from $500 million to $5-6 billion in annual revenue.Rather than fighting to maintain dominance in coding assistants, Microsoft is repositioning GitHub as a platform for all AI coding agents. The company announced at its GitHub Universe conference that its new Agent HQ interface will allow outside coding assistants, including OpenAI's Codex and Anthropic's Claude Code, to plug into the GitHub ecosystem.""When you say, who's it now? Claude's going to kill you, Cursor is going to kill you, it's not Borland.Thank God,"" Nadella said, referencing the defunct 1990s software company. ""That means we are in the right direction.""The strategy reflects a calculated bet that GitHub's 180 million developer user base and role as the central repository for code gives Microsoft structural advantages even as individual tools compete. Jay Parikh, who oversees GitHub as Microsoft's executive vice president of CoreAI, told The Verge the company needs an ""arms-wide-open ecosystem"" approach.Nadella emphasized that the rapid growth of the overall AI coding category matters more than Microsoft's shrinking slice of it. ""The fact that we went from nothing to this scale is the market expansion,"" he said, comparing it to the cloud computing transition that ultimately grew Microsoft's business despite lower margins than the previous server-based model.The CEO noted that GitHub continues to benefit regardless of which coding tool wins, as repositories, pull requests, and developer sign-ups have reached all-time highs. ""Guess where all the repos of all these other guys who are generating lots and lots of code go? They go to GitHub,"" Nadella said on the podcast, adding that one developer joins GitHub every second.",GitHub Copilot's market share has declined from nearly 100% to around 25% in just one year.

A Tribute to Visionaries

Art as a bridge between past and future





Strengthening national identity through creative initiatives





The artist behind the vision









A monumental new artwork now commands the façade of Dubai International Financial Centre’s Gate Building, honoring the UAE’s Founding Fathers and celebrating the nation’s journey from its historic roots to its bold future. Commissioned under the directive of H.H. Sheikh Ahmed bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Second Deputy Ruler of Dubai and Chairman of the Dubai Media Council, the installation serves as a striking centerpiece of Dubai’s ‘National Month’ campaign, blending artistic vision with national prideAs part of the ongoing ‘National Month’ celebrations in Dubai, Brand Dubai, the creative arm of the Government of Dubai Media Office, partnered with Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) to unveil a large-scale installation on the façade of The Gate Building, an iconic landmark of the Centre.The artwork pays homage to the UAE’s Founding Fathers, the late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan and the late Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum. It forms a centerpiece of the #ZayedAndRashid campaign, organised for the second consecutive year by Brand Dubai, which runs from UAE Flag Day on 3 November to the 54th Eid Al Etihad on 2 December. The installation visually narrates the story of the Union and the nation’s continuous achievements across generations.Shaima Al Suwaidi, Director of Brand Dubai, highlighted the importance of the collaboration, stating, “We take pride in our renewed partnership with DIFC for the third consecutive year to mark key national occasions through creative works that express our deep gratitude to the founding leaders Sheikh Zayed and Sheikh Rashid, who together laid the foundations of the Union.”The artwork, designed by Emirati artist Ahmed BaFadhl, captures the UAE’s identity with a blend of national spirit and creative vision. It merges portraits of the Founding Fathers with symbols of modern achievement, including the Hope Probe, Etihad-SAT, Rashid Rover 2, and the Mohammed Bin Rashid Space Centre’s Rashid Rover. This combination reflects the UAE’s trajectory from its historic founding to its pioneering role in science and space exploration.Al Suwaidi emphasized that the installation conveys both heritage and ambition: “The artwork reflects the enduring legacy and vision that continue to shape the UAE. It embodies values of determination and faith, while inspiring the community to carry forward the nation’s journey of progress.”Alya Al Zarouni, Chief Operating Officer at DIFC, remarked, “The stunning artwork on The Gate Building blends heritage with future aspirations and symbolises how economic leadership and innovation are anchored in strong national foundations.”Amina Taher, Member of the #ZayedAndRashid Campaign Organising Committee, noted that the installation exemplifies the power of art in conveying a national message of loyalty and belonging. The campaign’s creative initiatives, from murals to community events—have become tangible symbols of the Union’s spirit, helping younger generations connect with their history while looking toward the future.Standing 50 metres tall, the artwork is part of a series of events organised by Brand Dubai with government, semi-government, and private sector partners. These activations pay tribute to the historic meeting of the Founding Fathers in Al Khawaneej, marking the beginning of the Union, while reinforcing the unity of Emirati society and its enduring bond with the nation’s leadership.Ahmed BaFadhl, an architect and visual creator, drew inspiration from his late grandfather and the UAE’s landscape to develop a style that blends simplicity with imagination. Starting with pencil and coffee sketches, he now uses digital art to create works that express both emotion and national identity. His approach embodies a distinctly Emirati perspective, connecting traditional values with modern creativity.","50-metre Gate Building artwork honors UAE Founding Fathers, blending portraits, space symbols, and national pride.

Red Sea Global: Driving regenerative development









Saudi Arabia is set to redefine luxury, wellness, and economic impact with the opening of AMAALA Triple Bay. Developed by Red Sea Global, the ultra-luxury coastal destination on the Red Sea is projected to create 50,000 jobs and inject USD 3 billion into the nation’s GDP, marking a landmark step in the Kingdom’s Vision 2030 transformation. Beyond its economic significance, AMAALA promises an unparalleled fusion of regenerative tourism, wellness experiences, and world-class hospitality.AMAALA, derived from the Arabic word for hope, is nestled across three naturally occurring bays where the Hijaz Mountains meet the Red Sea. The destination offers a new approach to coastal luxury, with a focus on wellness, rejuvenation, and connection to nature. Its guiding principle is simple: to help guests and residents “live longer, better,” whether through tranquil retreats or adventure-filled experiences along the sun-drenched coastline.John Pagano, Group CEO of Red Sea Global, underscores the ambition: AMAALA is envisioned as the new home of wellness, drawing inspiration from Saudi Arabia’s long-standing traditions of retreat and renewal. The destination is designed to balance high-end luxury with environmental and cultural stewardship.AMAALA’s launch will introduce six world-class resorts, alongside a yacht club, marine life institute, state-of-the-art marina, and a Marina Village. A 5km linear park, the Wellness Route, will connect the resorts and experiences, allowing visitors to traverse pristine natural surroundings seamlessly.Additional first-phase attractions include Corallium, a three-level marine life institute highlighting the Red Sea’s biodiversity, and the AMAALA Hotel, offering 144 keys and multiple dining options for staff and guests alike.AMAALA is integral to Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030.

Phase One alone involved an investment of SAR 51.04 billion, encompassing nine resorts and over 1,600 keys. Future openings include the Clinique La Prairie Health Resort, Jayasom Wellness Resort, and The Ritz-Carlton Resort.The destination also promotes sustainable development at a global scale. Designed to host no more than 500,000 visitors annually, AMAALA aims to achieve a 30% net conservation benefit to local ecosystems by 2040. The development is fully powered by renewable energy, preventing the emission of 350,000 tCO₂e each year.Guests can now easily reach AMAALA via the Red Sea International Airport, now offering direct flights from Doha, Dubai, Jeddah, and Riyadh. Transfers to the resorts will be conducted in luxury electric vehicles, with additional convenient European routes imminent.

Big Relief For Indians: Donald Trump Clarifies $100K H-1B Fee Won’t Apply To Existing Visa Holders





Amrutesh Vallabhaneni, an H-1B visa holder in the US, has brought a lawsuit against his employer, accusing the company of forced labor, labor trafficking and withholding visa documents, Breitbart News reported. Jay Palmer, Vallabhaneni's consultant who prepared the lawsuit, said it is a Squid Game for Indian workers in the US job market, as the ultimate goal is to stay in America, surviving the exploitative culture, created by Indian CEOs. These Indian-origin CEOs import their ""home-country caste discrimination politics"" to their workplaces in the US, Palmer said.According to the report, Vallabhaneni studied in India, got an F-1 student visa and a loan to attend a US college in 2015.

The TOI correspondent from Washington:

'Love Us Again': Donald Trump Offers Fair Trade Deal, Promises To Reduce India Tariffs After Tension





Indian spice merchants and tea growers will be among global exporters who will breathe a sigh of relief along with American consumers after US President Donald Trump, feeling the heat of rising domestic prices due to tariffs, moved to lower import duties on nearly 200 food, farm, and agricultural items.While coffee from Brazil, beef from Argentina, and bananas and other fruits from Latin and Central American countries made headlines for Trump’s tariff rollback stemming from domestic disquiet about cost of living, tucked deep in the so-called TACO (Trump always chickens out) list is a range of spices including black pepper, cloves, cumin, cardamom, turmeric, ginger etc, varieties of tea, mango derivatives, and some nuts including cashew, all of which India exports to the U.S.Indian spice exports to the U.S was valued at more than $ 500 million in 2024, and the U.S imported tea from India worth nearly $ 90 million in the same period. The U.S also imported $843 million worth of fresh or dried cashew nuts -- which also got a break -- from across the world, with India accounting for around 20 percent of the imports.Not making the cut however are Indian seafoods, including shrimp, and basmati rice, which are multi-BILLION dollar exports from India to the U.S.Indian gems, jewelry, and apparel too remain under 50 percent US tariff+sanctions, pending a trade deal that Trump has said will happen once New Delhi turns off the Russian oil spigot and steps up buying U.S energy.Effectively, the exemptions apply only to about $500 million to $ 1 billion in qualifying agricultural exports from India, potentially boosting competitiveness and stabilizing market access amid a 37% drop in India's overall U.S. exports since the tariffs hit. The broader challenges posed by the U.S.'s punitive 50% tariffs on most Indian goods (imposed in August 2025 over India's Russian oil purchases) remain.Trump’s rollback, announced through an executive order he signed on Friday, comes amid growing disquiet across the country over cost of living, reflected in voter dissatisfaction that led to a GOP rout in by elections at the hands of Democrats who campaigned on the “affordability” message.The U.S President has also floated the idea of using tariff revenue to issue $2,000 rebate checks to Americans and launched a probe into the meat packing industry following Americans’ beef over high prices.U.S trade associations and political and economic commentators expressed relief at the President’s rollback, which came even as he insisted his tariffs have not increased cost of living and prices have actually come down. ""Trump just reduced tariffs on beef and coffee because people are so pissed off about groceries, and the recent election kicked him in the nuts over it,” read one social media post.The President and his minions are accused of being tone deaf to cost of living issues that prompted one wag to remark “My budget and my reality are not on speaking terms anymore.” The subject became a lighting rod for criticism after Trump hosted a Gatsby-themed Halloween party at his Mara-a-Lago estate and embarked on building an extravagant ballroom bigger than the White House it will be attached to – all the while preening about what critics describe as a gilded Oval Office now garishly overlaid with gold curios and accents.","US President Donald Trump has moved to lower import duties on nearly 200 food, farm, and agricultural items.

Why Pakistani critics are skeptical?







Taking ""lessons"" from tensions with India, Pakistan has moved to fortify the constitutional basis of military command, signaling a push to modernize defense structures and tighten civilian-military coherence. Its law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, on Saturday, tabled the 27th Constitutional Amendment Bill in the upper house, a move aimed at revising Article 243 to formally enshrine the appointments and parallel ranks of the Army, Air, and Naval chiefs.Citing “lessons” from recent India-Pakistan standoffs, Tarar said the nature of modern warfare had changed, requiring constitutional alignment with evolving command realities.“Recent Pakistan-India tensions have taught us many lessons. The nature and strategy of war have completely changed. Appointment procedures and some positions were previously in the Army Act but were not mentioned in the 1973 Constitution. Parallel ranks exist worldwide for Air Chief and Naval Chief,” Tarar said.The move, however, has come under scanner as many believe it could give more power to military than the civilian government in Pakistan.India, on May 7, launched Operation Sindoor against terror sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, killing over 100 terrorists and targeting key JeM and LeT camps. The move, which came in retaliation to Pahalgam terror attack, turned into a major India-Pakistan issue with the latter also launching a military operation against India.By May 10, the two nations announced a ceasefire after Pakistan approached India for truce talks.Ten days after the truce, Pakistani army general Asim Munir was promoted to the rank of field marshal, the principal military advisor to the prime minister and the president of Pakistan on all matters related to national security. Before Munir, former Pakistan President Genral Ayub Khan had self elevated himself to field marshal in 1959.The proposed changes to Article 243 in Pakistan's Constitution, are designed to significantly bolster the authority of the military, specifically, army chief and recently designated field marshal Asim Munir. Here's how:According to an article by Pakistani media outlet Dawn, legal experts in Pakistan remain divided on whether such institutional adjustments truly warrant a constitutional amendment, noting that most operational reforms can be achieved through ordinary legislation rather than altering Article 243.Constitutional experts argued that modernising command structures or creating a Chief of Defence Staff-type position does not require amending Article 243. Such reforms could be introduced through ordinary legislation or defence rules. Altering the Constitution, they warned, risks expanding military autonomy under the guise of structural integration.Another confusion surrounding Article 243 stems from the changes introduced by the 26th Amendment, which extended the army chief’s tenure from three to five years. The current chief, appointed under the old law and later elevated to the ceremonial rank of field marshal, a position not mentioned in the Constitution, has become the focal point of legal ambiguity.Dawn reported that experts remain divided on whether his term automatically extends under the new law or requires a fresh notification, raising questions about the real intent behind the proposed 27th Amendment: to resolve this technical uncertainty or to further cement the military’s influence within Pakistan’s constitutional framework.","Pakistan's law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, on Saturday, tabled the 27th Constitutional Amendment Bill in the upper house.

Prices surge, tandoors punished

Trade paralysis and a deepening food crisis

Water shortage adds to worries – dams running dry





(With inputs from agencies)





Pakistan’s twin cities are staring at a worsening flour emergency after the Punjab food department halted wheat supplies to mills in Rawalpindi and Islamabad, triggering panic across markets and raising questions over the country’s fragile food security. The sudden suspension has deepened an already tense economic climate, with transport blockades, water shortages and declining dam levels all feeding fears of another nationwide crisis.Dealers say all existing orders for flour, wheat and fine flour were cancelled from Friday night, leaving shops and tandoor owners without stock, PTI reported citing the The Express Tribune.The Rawalpindi Flour Mills Association, which held an emergency meeting to address the crisis, warned that “production will remain paralysed” unless wheat permits are restored immediately. The association described the ban as “ill-considered” and cautioned that shortages could spiral into a humanitarian emergency in the federal capital and adjoining regions.Flour inflation has shot up at record pace, prompting anger from bakers and retailers. According to the Pakistan Naanbai Association, the price of a 79-kilogram sack of red flour has doubled to PKR 11,000 since the Shehbaz Sharif–Maryam Nawaz government took office.Fine flour, used widely for bread and bakery items, has risen from PKR 6,200 to PKR 12,600.The association’s president, Shafiq Qureshi, accused authorities of “state oppression”, claiming that dozens of tandoors have been demolished and nearly a hundred sealed for selling roti at higher prices in line with rising flour rates. Many owners have been fined between PKR 25,000 and PKR 50,000. “Instead of fixing the wheat supply, they are taking out their frustration on us,” Qureshi said, warning that families are being pushed to breaking point as bread becomes increasingly unaffordable.While wheat supply chokes Punjab’s food chain, Pakistan’s transport routes are already gridlocked due to deteriorating relations with Afghanistan. Thousands of trucks carrying food items, pharmaceuticals and export consignments for Afghanistan and Central Asia have been stranded at ports and highways.Senior Vice Chairman of the Goods Transport Association Imdad Hussain Naqvi said drivers are stuck without food, water or security. “This is not just a loss for transporters; it's a loss for the entire state,” he said, as quoted by PTI. He further warned that perishable goods are rotting on highways and thousands of workers are on the brink of starvation.The current wheat crisis comes months after India regulated flows from the Chenab following the Pahalgam terror attack. The move had contributed to a sharp drop in water levels at the country’s two key dams, Mangla and Tarbela.Pakistan is among six countries with the highest levels of inefficient agricultural water use, worsening freshwater losses amid arid conditions, according to the World Bank’s first global water monitoring report, Continental Drying: A Threat to Our Common Future.The study highlights that inefficient irrigation in drying regions—particularly in Pakistan, Algeria, Cambodia, Mexico, Thailand, Tunisia, and Romania—drives massive water waste, with more than two-thirds linked to water-intensive crops.","Flour inflation has shot up at record pace, prompting anger from bakers and retailers.

A glimpse of the future at Manchester Airport





Building an “Intelligent” border





Results, reactions and next steps





Britain’s place in a global shift









The United Kingdom has begun trials of a “contactless” border control system, allowing British travellers to re-enter the country without presenting their passports. The technology, which uses facial recognition to verify identity, was tested over three weeks at Manchester Airport and marks a major step towards what officials call an “intelligent, frictionless border. ”Passengers arriving at Manchester Airport in October became the first to pass through Britain’s experimental contactless border. For three weeks, British passport holders were able to clear immigration without scanning their passports. Instead, their faces were matched against existing government databases through AI-driven facial recognition systems integrated into the familiar e-gates.Phil Douglas, director-general of Border Force, confirmed that the trial had “considerably reduced” processing times. He described the new experience succinctly: “People approach the e-gate, it recognises them as already on our database, and they’re checked through.” The system’s success has prompted officials to consider a wider rollout, signalling a potential transformation in how Britain manages its borders.Douglas said the Manchester trial forms part of a broader effort to modernise the UK’s borders. “The border has really changed over the last few years and that work is picking up pace,” he noted.Advances in artificial intelligence, biometrics and digital identity verification are now being combined with traditional checks such as passports and visas.Plans for the contactless border were first disclosed last year, when the Border Force outlined its ambition for an “intelligent border” designed to make crossings smoother while maintaining security. More than 270 e-gates are already in use across Britain’s airports and ports. Under new contracts, the number is set to expand, with Douglas stating: “It’s our intention that almost everybody will go through an e-gate of one description or another. ”While the technology promises faster movement, Douglas stressed the importance of preserving what he termed the “theatre” of the border—the visible sense that every traveller is still subject to scrutiny. “When people are crossing the border, they’re stopped, and it’s a moment they know they’re being checked,” he said. “New technology must not remove that feeling.”According to Douglas, the Manchester pilot demonstrated that the new system can sharply cut transaction times, making Britain’s border performance “compete pretty well with almost any other country.” Some airports, however, have raised an unusual concern: passengers are clearing border control so quickly that baggage reclaim areas risk becoming congested. “It has been said to me by some airports, ‘don’t get too fast, because then you’ll give us a problem at baggage collection’,” Douglas remarked.The contactless system remains limited to British passport holders for now, but the government intends to expand its reach. Over the past decade, e-gates have gradually been opened to arrivals from countries including Australia, Canada, Japan, Singapore, South Korea and the United States. The new technology is expected to extend this inclusivity further, aligning the UK with international leaders in biometric border management.The trial places the UK alongside nations such as the United States, Australia and the United Arab Emirates, which have invested heavily in biometric border technology. Dubai, for instance, already permits contactless passage for citizens of 50 nationalities. Britain’s approach aims to meet this “gold standard,” positioning its border as one of the most technologically advanced in the world.Douglas contrasted the UK’s innovations with the European Union’s forthcoming Entry/Exit System, which will soon require British travellers to provide fingerprints and photographs upon each entry and exit. By comparison, the UK’s biometric recognition system seeks to simplify travel rather than add new layers of formality.","The UK has begun trials of a “contactless” border control system, allowing British travellers to re-enter the country without presenting their passports.

Honourable mentions







Turbulent times are ahead for the BBC as the search for the next director general begins following Tim Davie’s resignation, which came after the corporation broadcast a doctored version of Donald Trump’s Jan 6 speech that the White House condemned as misleading.With questions over bias dominating headlines and key funding talks approaching, BBC chair Samir Shah has urged a “smooth transition” as he begins the search for Davie’s successor, according to the Guardian.The BBC is under pressure on several fronts. Its news output is facing backlash and its audience habits are shifting. The next director general will need both a newsroom background and strong commercial experience. This has shaped a developing list of front-runners, some familiar from the last recruitment round and others newly in contention who could replace Davie, now the former director who served for over 20 years in BBC.One of the most talked-about names is former Channel 4 chief executive Alex Mahon, who was previously approached about the job but chose not to take part in the final shortlist. Mahon recently left Channel 4 after nearly eight years in charge, becoming the broadcaster’s first female chief executive and leading it through threats of privatisation, major restructuring and crises including the Russell Brand scandal.She has now become chief executive of Superstruct, a private equity-backed live entertainment company that runs events such as Boardmasters in Cornwall. The question is whether the chance to become the BBC’s first female director general would tempt her to leave her new role.Charlotte Moore, the BBC’s former director of content, was also a finalist last time. She oversaw a budget of £1 billion and helped deliver huge hits such as The Great British Bake Off, Luther and Bodyguard. Moore has recently taken over as chief executive of Left Bank Pictures, the Sony-owned studio behind The Crown. Her return to the BBC is considered possible but not guaranteed, given the timing of her new position.Jay Hunt, currently creative director for worldwide video and Europe at Apple TV Plus, is another strong contender. She has held senior positions at Channel 4, Channel 5 and the BBC, including editing the BBC’s flagship news programmes and later running BBC One. At Channel 4, she orchestrated the high-profile acquisition of The Great British Bake Off from the BBC, and at Apple she has overseen successes including Slow Horses. Her mix of news, entertainment and international streaming experience makes her stand out.ITV boss Carolyn McCall is said to be weighing up her future while exploring a possible sale of ITV’s television business to Comcast. She was approached for the BBC role previously and remains highly regarded, but after almost eight demanding years at ITV she may be reluctant to take on another exhausting challenge.Several names that surfaced in past searches are being discussed again. All3Media chief Jane Turton and former Sky executive Sophie Turner Laing were both approached previously. Turner Laing now leads the National Film and Television School’s board and has not held a major executive post in recent years, which could work against her.The 2020 shortlist also featured Will Lewis, now chief executive of the Washington Post. Allegations linked to the phone-hacking scandal, which he denies, are seen as making him a high-risk option for the BBC. Another former finalist, Doug Gurr, the one-time head of Amazon’s UK operations, currently serves as the interim chair of the Competition and Markets Authority.","The BBC is under pressure on several fronts.

Nuclear energy and renewables are key

Other European countries have also made a shift

Could wind power be the immediate solution?





Olkiluoto island on the western coast of Finland used to be just an energy hub for the country bordering Russia. But with the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, it became strategically important as Helsinki decided it could no longer rely on Russian energy.Up until then, the country had been receiving half of its energy imports from the neighboring country, with which it shares a 1,300-kilometer (807-mile) border. They included electricity, oil and natural gas deliveries.""Before 2022, there had been the optimistic hope we had gotten past an era where it's all about enlarging territory and invading sovereign countries and we could live happily in peace having trade,"" says Sari Multala, Finland's minister of climate and the environment.""But then, we understood that was not the case and that we had to take care of our own sovereignty, also when it comes to energy. We cannot depend on a hostile partner,"" she told DW.Helsinki dropped its formerly neutral stance and announced it would join the Western defense alliance NATO. Moscow cut off electricity supplies to Finland, supposedly because Helsinki refused to pay for them in the Russian currency, the ruble.Russia's share in Finland's energy import has since gone down to almost zero.Oil, which made up for 19% of Finland's energy consumption in 2019, is now being imported from Norway, the UK and the US. Natural gas, at the time representing 5% in the country's energy mix, is imported in its liquefied LNG form.Finland's state-owned company Gasgrid Finland, meanwhile, has commissioned a new floating LNG terminal in the southern port of Inga.Finland's new nuclear reactor, Olkiluoto 3 is one of the biggest in the world with a total capacity of 1,600 mega-watts (MW), and has boosted Finland's nuclear share in electricity production from 28% in 2022 to 39% now.But that came at a cost. Olkiluoto 3's price tag almost quadrupled to €11 billion ($12.7 billion). Building it took 18 years instead of four as initially planned. The skyrocketing costs had operator TVO cancel plans for a fourth reactor on Olkiluoto island.""Consumers are benefiting from low electricity prices. And we have created 5,000 direct and indirect jobs,"" he told DW during a recent press tour of the reactor's premises.But other electricity sources also contributed to Finland's energy shift, particularly renewables.In 2024, onshore wind farms made up 24% of the country's electricity production, compared with 14% in 2022.For Veli-Pekka Tynkkynen, professor at the Finnish Centre for Russian and Eastern European Studies at the University of Helsinki, renewables are the way to go because nuclear, biomass, hydropower and wind energy would make the Finnish model ""resilient.""""But it's very expensive to build new nuclear power plants nowadays because of the high safety standards. And we should move away from fossil energy. It's not a good idea to be dependent on autocratic countries — be it Russia, Saudi Arabia or the US,"" he told DW.Tynkkynen added, however, that Finland had not managed to achieve complete energy independence from Russia. ""Finnish energy company Fortum has tried for the past three years to substitute Russian uranium deliveries, but has not yet been able to do so,"" he said.Thijs van de Graf, associate professor for international politics at Ghent University in Belgium and an expert on energy policy, agrees that the right mix is key.""Most European countries have looked towards other energy sources after the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine,"" he told DW. ""The recipe for energy security includes energy efficiency, electrification and renewables.""He added this was particularly the case in countries where there was not as much political appetite for nuclear as in Finland.According to a May 2025 poll by UK polling institute Verian, 68% of Finns have a positive opinion of nuclear energy, which is why operator TVO wouldn't rule out building additional nuclear reactors.Pasi Tuohimaa is communications manager at Posiva, a company owned by TVO and Fortum and specializing in the final disposal of spent nuclear fuel in the Onkalo storage facility located at the power plant site .Posiva plays a crucial role in ensuring the safety of nuclear waste management in Finland.On a recent afternoon, Tuohimaa was leading a group of journalists through the Onkalo project which is to open in the coming months.The waste of the country's five existing nuclear power plants will be stored there for good in one-ton capsules that are to be stored in chambers in the ground.Operator Posiva has so far spent between €500 million ($577 million) and €1 billion on the storage facility encompassing 60 kilometers (37.2 miles) of tunnels about 450 meters (1,476 feet) below ground level.""We have a solution to take care safely of the spent nuclear fuel. Excavating tunnels is not that difficult. Finland is full of bedrock. So there can be other places here and abroad,"" Tuohima told DW.Finland's Climate and Environment Minister Sari Multala says the Nordic country is currently ""paving the way for more nuclear power.""Speaking with journalists on the tour of the Posiva site, he said the government was currently ""reviewing our nuclear energy legislation to facilitate a faster permitting processes and investigating whether nuclear [power] will need some financial support or risk-sharing mechanisms in the future.""But Anni Mikkonen, CEO of industry association Renewables Finland, objects to the current government's pro-nuclear policy arguing that wind farms can be completed much faster.""There's a really strong project pipeline that you can start building when electricity is needed. We could double onshore capacity within 10 years,"" she told DW.She also said that ""additional [Finish] power could be used for electric cars or exported to other countries"" so that these could also become more independent from Russian energy imports.","Finland's new nuclear reactor, Olkiluoto 3 is one of the biggest in the world with a total capacity of 1,600 mega-watts (MW) It has boosted Finland's nuclear share in electricity production from 28% in 2022 to 39% now. Other electricity sources also contributed to Finland's energy shift, particularly renewables.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125351708,imgsize-545099,width-400,resizemode-4/representative-image.jpg"
"Hitler’s DNA reveals he possibly had a micropenis, one testicle and severe sexual-development issues",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/hitlers-dna-reveals-he-possibly-had-a-micropenis-one-testicle-and-severe-sexual-development-issues/articleshow/125309765.cms,"

What the DNA findings actually show





Dispelling myths about Hitler’s ancestry

Exploring possible neurodiverse and mental health indicators

How researchers obtained Hitler’s genetic material

What science can illuminate, and what it cannot





A new forensic genetic analysis featured in Channel 4’s documentary Hitler’s DNA: Blueprint of a Dictator is offering unprecedented scientific insight into Adolf Hitler’s biological and medical history. Using DNA recovered from blood-stained cloth taken from the sofa where Hitler died in 1945, researchers suggest he may have had multiple sexual-development abnormalities, including the possibility of a micropenis, an undescended testicle and Kallmann syndrome, a condition that disrupts hormonal development and puberty. The findings challenge long-circulated rumours while shedding fresh light on aspects of his life long shrouded in speculation.The genetic analysis indicates that Hitler likely carried markers associated with Kallmann syndrome, a congenital condition that affects reproductive development. Individuals with the disorder may experience reduced testosterone, lack of puberty, infertility and underdeveloped sexual organs.The researchers note that people with this condition have a one-in-ten chance of having a micropenis. While the DNA cannot confirm this definitively, the new evidence aligns with historical accounts suggesting Hitler may have had genital abnormalities.Stories from the First World War described ridicule from fellow soldiers, and a 1923 medical record discovered in 2015 documented that Hitler had an undescended testicle.Professor Turi King, the geneticist leading the study, said she approached the project with caution but believed it was important to carry out the work with scientific rigour. Her previous work identifying the remains of King Richard III lent credibility to the approach and methodology.The documentary also debunks one of the most persistent myths about Hitler: the rumour that he had Jewish ancestry. Genetic markers associated with that lineage were not found in the analysed sample. Historians have long argued there is no credible evidence for the claim, and the DNA results reinforce that conclusion.For a dictator who built policy around ideas of racial purity, the destruction of this myth is a significant historical clarification.The DNA analysis suggests Hitler showed elevated genetic markers linked to conditions such as autism, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. However, experts stress that these findings do not amount to a diagnosis. Genes can indicate predispositions but cannot determine behaviour, personality or moral choices.Dr Alex Tsompanidis, an autism researcher at the University of Cambridge, emphasised that no psychiatric label can be retroactively applied. He noted that environmental, social and personal factors play far larger roles in shaping behaviour than genetics alone.Professor Sir Simon Baron-Cohen warned that associating Hitler’s crimes with neurodiverse traits risks creating stigma. Most people with such conditions are neither violent nor cruel, he stressed, and many are empathetic and peaceful.The DNA sample used for the study originated from a blood-stained fabric cut by a US Army colonel from Hitler’s bunker sofa shortly after his death. Advances in forensic genetics made it possible to extract and sequence fragments of DNA decades later, though the researchers acknowledged the limitations of working with an aged and degraded sample.The scientific team verified the integrity of the material through multiple checks, following standards similar to those used in other historical forensic investigations.The new DNA analysis paints a clearer picture of Hitler’s possible medical conditions and helps separate biological fact from long-standing myth. It supports rumours about his sexual-development abnormalities, dismisses claims about Jewish ancestry and offers clues to potential neurodiverse markers.But the researchers are clear that genetics alone cannot explain the motivations or actions of one of history’s most destructive figures. Biology may influence development, but it does not predetermine cruelty or ideology.","DNA recovered from blood-stained cloth taken from the sofa where Hitler died in 1945.

Ultracheap and still duty-free

Millions of packages from China

Protecting consumers in the EU

EU authorities are not sitting still

EU countries are not sitting still either





When Chinese fast-fashion online retailer Shein opened its first boutique last week, there were both protests and a crowd of shoppers.The brick-and-mortar shop inside the BHV Marais department store in central Paris hit a nerve and not just because it is in the home of haute couture. It was a love-hate response to the company seen in many other areas.Shein, which is often put in the same category as the Temu online platform that allows manufacturers to sell much more than just fashion directly to consumers, has been criticized for things like counterfeits, aggressive marketing, poor working conditions, and unsafe products. Despite that, many are happy with more shopping options and the cheap prices.Though the two companies are different and have different business models, the result is often the same: a flood of cheap Chinese goods and the packaging to go along with it.Besides simply being ultracheap, another factor that played in the companies' favor is the European Union 's exemption from import duties for packages valued under €150 ($174).The US had a similar loophole for packages valued under $800 (€691), but has changed its regulations leading to a reduction in shipments.The EU is in the final stages of passing a similar rule to close its own low-value loophole, though it may not come into force until 2028.In the first half of 2025, Temu had an average of 115 million monthly active users in the EU and Shein had 145 million, according to their own numbers. For both platforms, this is around 12% more than the previous six months.One of the biggest concerns about these Chinese e-commerce platforms is sustainability. A majority of goods bought on their platforms are sent directly to consumers around the world from manufacturers in China. These individually packed goods are flown in for quick delivery and overwhelm customs authorities and often cannot be returned.Environmental groups are concerned about the clothing waste caused by cheap fast fashion, the plastic and cardboard packaging trash, plus the emissions from all those flights to move the goods around the world. And the numbers are indeed huge.In 2024, around 4.6 billion low-value items were imported into the EU, according to a report published in February by the EU executive Commission. That is twice the number in 2023 and more than triple the number in 2022.Of these 12 million packages a day, 91% are from China. Not all of these packages are from Temu or Shein, but together they have a huge share of the pie.""Europe is inundated by a tsunami of small parcels coming from China, and it's not about to stop,"" Agustin Reyna, director general of the Brussels-based European Consumer Organization (BEUC), told DW.Besides sustainability issues, consumer protection watchdogs and the European Commission have repeatedly warned of unsafe products that don't meet EU standards.New test results published on October 30 by Stiftung Warentest, an independent organization based in Berlin that specializes in product testing, reinforce what many fear.The tests, which were conducted with groups from Belgium and Denmark, showed dramatic results. Together, they looked into necklaces, USB chargers and baby toys.Of the 162 items purchased from manufacturers selling through Temu and Shein, 110 were not up to EU standards, and around a quarter were potentially dangerous. Some of the items had high levels of formaldehyde or heavy metals like cadmium. Some of the USB charges simply got too hot.The European Consumer Organisation thinks flouting safety regulations leads to unfair competition since some companies sell products that do not meet European safety standards, while local companies must follow such rules.In May, the EU Commission notified Shein about practices on its platform that infringe EU consumer law. Among the complaints are fake discounts, pressuring consumers to complete purchases, misleading information about consumers' legal rights, deceptive product labels and misleading sustainability claims.In July, the Commission preliminarily found that Temu is in breach of its obligations under the Digital Services Act by not doing enough to stop the sale of illegal products. Further investigations are ongoing and could lead to a large fine.In October, Germany's antitrust authority, the Cartel Office, initiated proceedings against Temu. They want to see if the platform is possibly influencing the pricing on its German online marketplace, including setting the final selling prices.In August, Shein was fined €1 million by Italy's competition authority for using misleading environmental claims.In July, Shein was fined €40 million by France's competition agency for misleading discounts and environmental claims. That brings total French fines for the company this year to €191 million.France has gone a step further and is working on new regulations for fast-fashion companies like Temu and Shein. If approved, it would ban their ads in France, force them to report on the environmental effects of their goods and add a levy of up to €10 for each garment bought.Big fines and more regulations may slow Chinese e-commerce giants but will not stop them.""Europe needs to get its act together and make Temu and Shein accountable,"" said Agustin Reyna. ""We need clear responsibilities and deterrent consequences when the products they sell break our rules.""To make this happen, the EU needs ambitious customs reform and market surveillance. But if the EU allows packages valued under €150 to come in duty-free until 2028, companies will continue to take advantage of the loophole and European customers will likely keep shopping.","In 2024, around 4.6 billion low-value items were imported into the EU, according to a report published in February. Of these 12 million packages a day, 91% are from China.
