NEW DELHI: An analysis by Centre for Science and Environment has drawn attention to the season’s first smog — on Diwali day. It also said that the PM2.5 concentration this Diwali was 34% higher than in 2022, despite both occurring in the month of October.Diwali night this year also had higher nitrogen oxide levels than in 2023. In addition to the local cracker bursting, there was also a sharp rise in pollutants resulting from harvest stubble burning, accounting for 27% of the city’s pollutants that day. The analysis fo und that PM2.5 showed a spike of 46% from Oct 28 through to Oct 31, the festival day.The study said that by midnight on October 31, PM2.5 hit a peak of 603 micrograms per cubic metre, 13% higher than Diwali peaks recorded in both 2022 (when Diwali occurred on Oct 24) and 2023 (Nov 12).It established that PM2.5 in the pollution between 6am and 4pm on Diwali was 92% higher than last year , reflecting high local and regional pollution aided by the sharp increase in the share of farm pollutants.However, the analysis noted that pollution dispersed quickly this year. “The reasons behind this late buildup and early dissipation of pollution on Diwali day were warm atmospheric conditions with relatively more efficient natural ventilation and adequate wind in the city,” the analysis explained.CSE said there was a massive build-up of pollution in different parts of the city on Diwali night, reaching ‘severe’ levels. “This year, nine of the 38 air quality monitoring stations recorded PM2.5 concentrations exceeding the critical threshold of 900 micrograms per cubic metre on Diwali night,” the report said. “The highest levels were observed at Nehru Nagar, reaching 994 microgram per cubic metre, followed by Anand Vihar at 992, Pusa IMD at 985, Wazirpur at 980 and JLN Stadium at 963.”The report noted the sudden escalation in farm fires on Diwali, which accounted for 27% of pollution in Delhi. “According to IARI data, the fire count increased from 60 on October 30 to 605 on October 31. Punjab ac counted for the highest share at 80%, followed by Uttar Pradesh at 13% and Haryana at 7%. North-westerly winds prevailed during the day on October 31, amplifying the impact of stubble burning on Delhi’s air quality,” the report said.The city’s air quality turned from ‘poor’ to ‘very poor’ even when the share of smoke from farm fires was less than 3%, indicating the impact of local air pollution sources. As for vehicular pollution, the report stated that ITO had the highest NO2 levels.“Diwali night this year had higher NO2 levels compared with last year’s Diwali night. NO2 levels in the last three years have been higher on Diwali night and also the nights preceding it, which is indicative of congestion and high traffic conditions in the city leading to the festival night. ITO had the highest NO2 levels in the city with a night-time average of 182 microgram per cubic metre. JLN Stadium and Patparganj, with 104 and 101 micrograms per cubic metre were the other NO2 hotspots on Diwali night. Lodhi Road, with just 2 microgram per cubic metre of NO2, was the least affected area in the city,” the report said, while warning that the upcoming cold and calm weather might intensify the pollution status.","Diwali night this year also had higher nitrogen oxide levels than in 2023.

NEW DELHI: World Health Organisation ( WHO ) has, in its latest report on tuberculosis globally, acknowledged progress made in India to eliminate the infection.According to the report, TB incidence in India has declined by 18%, from 237 per lakh population in 2015 to 195 per lakh population in 2023. This is more than double the pace of decline as compared to the global decline of 8%, the UN health agency suggests.""This leap in coverage has been a result of the momentum India has created and sustained around TB case finding and reflects the efforts of decentralisation of healthcare services through over 1.7 lakh Ayushman Arogya Mandir across the country,"" a health ministry official said.While WHO had downsized its estimation of TB mortality in India last year, the current report documents the sustained reduction in deaths due to TB achieved by India from 28 per lakh population to 22 per lakh population, a 21% decline. ""The TB budget saw a historic 5.3-times leap in allocation from Rs 640 crores in 2015 to Rs 3,400 crores in 2022-23,"" the health ministry said. The WHO report notes that a majority of the funding of the TB programme comes from govt resources.The Centre, health ministry sources said, is procuring over 800 AI-enabled portable chest x-ray machines to complement India's extensive TB laboratory network - the largest in the world, with 7,767 rapid molecular testing facilities and 87 culture & drug susceptibility testing laboratories spread across the country.In Sept, govt approved introduction of the BPaLM regimen - a novel treatment for Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis ( MDR-TB ) under its National TB Elimination Program (NTEP) as a highly effective and shorter treatment option. India has notified 19.8 lakh TB patients (Jan - Sept 2024) as compared to 19 lakhs during the same period in 2023, a 4% increase.","World Health Organisation ( WHO ) acknowledged progress made in India to eliminate the infection.

DEHRADUN: National Green Tribunal ( NGT ), in response to a report filed by amicus curiae Gaurav Bansal in the matter of forest fires in Uttarakhand, directed that “Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change be impleaded through principal secretary of environment, principal chief conservator of forest, chief wildlife warden, divisional forest officer of Dehradun and Forest Survey of India (FSI), Dehradun”, and instructed them to submit their comprehensive reply in the matter within three weeks.NGT had appointed advocate Bansal as amicus curiae in April to assist with proceedings regarding leaf burning in Badkot forest range along RishikeshDehradun road. While submitting his report, Bansal emphasised that Uttarakhand suffers from a “glaring lack of essential infrastructure required for efficient forest fire management .”The report, furnished last week, stated “it was imperative to address critical deficiencies and violations hindering effective forest fire management in state.” “This encompasses a lack of firefighting equipment such as protective goggles, protective gear, weapons, etc, insufficient patrolling vehicles to access remote areas, and a dearth of communication devices such as wireless and satellite phones essential for coordination and timely response during fire emergencies,” it stated.The report highlighted that forest department was facing infrastructure challenges , including a shortage of new structures to meet increasing demands. The forest guard or forester chowkis being situated in remote areas, devoid of basic amenities, also poses a critical hurdle.Bansal said “ construction and maintenance of fire lines is fundamental for effective fire management but Uttarakhand govt has not reviewed its fire lines for a considerable period, compromising the state’s fire management endeavours.”The report said for every 2,448 hectareforest, there was only one forest guard, who is also responsible for controlling illicit tree felling, mining, wildlife poaching, and other forest and wildliferelated offences. “What exacerbates the situation is that in Uttarakhand, there is a system of recovery for loss of revenue due to illicit felling from salary of forest guards or foresters. Safeguarding by sole forest guard is nothing but an unattainable task,” it stated. This year, Uttarakhand recorded a significant number of forest fires, with 1,276 cases reported, impacting 1,771.6 ha, as per govt data.","NGT had appointed advocate Bansal as amicus curiae in April to assist with proceedings regarding leaf burning in Badkot forest range along RishikeshDehradun road.

Weather rescues Delhi's air: 2nd cleanest post-Diwali since 2015,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/weather-rescues-citys-air-2nd-cleanest-post-diwali-since-2015/articleshow/114860962.cms,"Representative Image

NEW DELHI: Good weather spared Delhiites a “severe” punishment a day after Diwali as widespread use of fireworks, a spike in the share of stubble burning , and emissions from other local sources releasing toxic gases pushed the city’s air quality into the upper level of “very poor” late Thursday night and Friday morning.High ventilation by winds of up to 16km/h and above-normal temperatures kept AQI within the “very poor” range, making it the second cleanest post-Diwali day since 2015.With clear skies, the day after Diwali was good in comparison to years like 2020 and 2021 — when air quality had plummeted to severe — and even last year, when AQI was 358. However, despite favourable conditions and lack of winter chill, post-Diwali 2024 still managed to spill a toxic cocktail of pollutants into the air.On Thursday, while some areas of south Delhi refrained from bursting crackers on a mass scale, the majority of the city made up for it. A spike in the share of stubble burning in the city's PM2.5 level also made a difference, with the share of stubble burning soaring to 27.61% on Diwali day (Thursday), compared to 8.4% on Wednesday and 1.8% on Tuesday.AQI peaked at 362 at 9am on Friday morning as the pollution load kept increasing until that time. However, after that, it gradually improved. By noon, it had improved to 354 on Friday, while the day’s average AQI was 339 against 328 on Thursday.""Even though the air quality on Diwali was in the very poor category — hitting severe levels during midnight — these conditions dissipated quickly the next day to reach moderate levels by the afternoon. This is mainly because of relatively warm conditions with reasonable wind speed and natural ventilation. The deep calm winter inversion conditions are yet to set in. Despite this, the month of October has also seen more poor and very poor days than previous years, even when the contribution of farm fires has been just around 1-3%, indicating a very high impact of local and regional pollution,” said Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, Research and Advocacy at the Centre for Science and Environment ( CSE ).Friday morning also turned hazy, which cleared with the winds and sun. According to the weather department, the wind speed was between 12- 16km/h until midnight on Diwali, which dropped to 3-7 km/h towards midnight but increased again on Friday morning, helping with ventilation and dispersal of pollutants.However, even as post-Diwali AQI 2024 turns out to be the second cleanest since 2015, what's concerning is the hourly spike in PM2.5 levels in some areas, which, as per the DPCC, spiked to more than 30 times the national permissible limits. ""In addition to pollution from firecracker bursts, stubble burning incidents in Punjab are on the rise, signalling that post-harvest burning is ramping up and will likely exacerbate pollution in DelhiNCR over the next two weeks. Immediate intervention from authorities is crucial to manage this issue,"" stated Sunil Dahiya, founder and lead analyst, Envirocatalysts.According to Abhishek Kar, senior programme lead, Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), while the wind speeds reaching over 2m/s between 7am and 4pm on Friday helped the city, the air quality is yet to see a breather. ""The air quality will remain an issue in the coming days due to an increase in stubble burning in the upwind states of Punjab and Haryana. According to the AQEWS, the AQI for the next seven days is expected to be consistently above 350 and will occasionally breach the 400- mark,” said Kar.","High ventilation by winds of up to 16km/h and above-normal temperatures kept AQI within the ‘very poor’ range. Despite favourable conditions and lack of winter chill, post-Diwali 2024 still managed to spill a toxic cocktail of pollutants into the air.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114861127,imgsize-22038,width-400,resizemode-4/114861127.jpg"

Without mentioning specific countries, Jaishankar noted instances where partners have commented on India’s domestic issues, often with a prefaced call for “honest conversations.”""Some friends may also be more complicated than others. They may not always share the same culture of mutual respect or ethos of diplomatic etiquette. We have from time to time seen comments on our domestic issues accompanied by a prefaced desire to have honest conversations,"" he said.The EAM said that friendships between nations are not exclusive, particularly in a multipolar world. He highlighted that it is to be expected that nations, even allies, will seek to maintain their own options while limiting those of others.""Even friendships will not be without some hedging. Relating to other major powers is also a challenge in itself. The more global they are, the broader their range of activities and interests,"" he said.""Friendships are also not exclusive, particularly so in a multipolar world. It is only to be expected that others, even friends, will seek to maintain their options while restricting ours,"" the EAM added.According to Jaishankar, the nation’s diplomatic efforts generate a sense of goodwill and have led to closer international engagement. He referred to this strategy as “diplomacy 101”.Jaishankar remarked on India’s unique position in the world, referring to it as a “Vishwamitra,” or friend to all, driven by a commitment to global good. ""We seek to be friends with as many as possible,” he said.Reflecting on the book’s insights, Jaishankar noted the role of strategic interests in forming alliances. While sentiment and values are influential, he argued, they must be aligned with national interests for relationships to thrive.He cited India's partnerships with key nations like the United States, Japan, and Australia, noting how these ties have flourished within the QUAD and have overcome “the hesitations of history.”""If all these ties have changed so much in the last decade, I am sure you would agree with me that much of the credit should go to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his personal interest and leadership, because remember, at least three of them have not even seen a high-level visit for three decades,"" the EAM said.Jaishankar summarised his view of friendship, saying, “Friends are about comfort and convergence, with an easy ability to work with each other.” True friends, he added, respect each other’s challenges and strive to find common ground. However, he cautioned that friendships are rarely straightforward or static. “They may have their challenges but are no less for it.

Indian diplomats under surveillance

'Cancelled' Diwali event

NEW DELHI: India has lodged a protest in the strongest terms in regards to the ""absurd and baseless"" references made by a Canadian minister about home minister Amit Shah , the external affairs ministry said on Saturday, adding that it also formally protested to the Justin Trudeau government regarding recent revelations that Indian diplomats in Canada were placed under ""audio and video surveillance"".Speaking during a press conference, MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said: ""Regarding the latest Canadian target, we summoned the representative of the Canadian High Commission on Friday ... It was conveyed in a diplomatic note that the Government of India protests in the strongest terms to the absurd and baseless references made to the Union Home Minister of India before the Committee by Deputy Minister David Morrison. In fact, the revelation that top Canadian officials deliberately leak unfounded insinuations to the international media as part of a conscious strategy to discredit India and influence other nations only confirms the view that the government of India has long held about the current Canadian government's political agenda and behavioural pattern. Such irresponsible actions will have serious consequences for bilateral ties.""The latest row between Canada and India erupted after Morrison confirmed Shah's name during a parliamentary session, linking him to actions targeting Sikh activists.Morrison had also told Canadian Parliament members of the national security committee that he had confirmed Shah's name to The Washington Post, which first reported the allegations. While addressing the Parliament members, Morrison did not say how Canada knew of Shah's alleged involvement.The ""baseless"" allegations against the home minister, follow accusations made by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau about Indian agents' involvement in the murder of pro-Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar , which has deteriorated India-Canada ties.Amid rising tensions, India recently expelled 6 Canadian diplomats and recalled its High Commissioner to Canada.In addition to these accusations, Canada has labeled India as an ""adversary"" in its National Cyber Threat Assessment, further straining diplomatic ties.The report suggests that Indian state-sponsored cyber actors may conduct espionage against Canada.Reacting to the report, the MEA said: ""We see this as yet another Canadian strategy to attack India. Canadian senior officials have openly confessed that they are seeking to manipulate global opinion against India ... as on other occasions, these imputations are made without any evidence.""Jaiswal further said that some consular officials were recently informed by the Canadian government that ""they have been and continue to be under audio and video surveillance"".""Their communications have also been intercepted. We have formally protested to the Canadian government as we deem these actions to be a flagrant violation of relevant diplomatic and consular conventions. By citing technicalities, the Canadian government cannot justify the fact that it is indulging in harassment and intimidation. Our diplomatic and consular personnel are already functioning in an environment of extremism and violence. This action of the Canadian Government aggravates the situation and is incompatible with established diplomatic norms and practices,"" the MEA said.On the reports of a cancelled Diwali celebration at Canada's Parliament Hill, Jaiswal said: ""We have seen some reports in this regard. It is unfortunate that the prevailing anti-India atmosphere in Canada has reached high levels of intolerance and extremism.""After severe backlash from the Hindu community, leader of the Conservative Party Pierre Poilievre had clarified that the event was not cancelled but rather rescheduled to a different venue. This clarification came from Poilievre, following initial reports that suggested the event was canceled due to recent geopolitical tensions between Canada and India.On the reduction in the number of visas by the Canadian government, the MEA spokesperson said: ""We are monitoring the well-being of our students and professionals who are working in Canada. Our concern for their safety and security remains strong.""","India has lodged a protest in the strongest terms in regards to the ""absurd and baseless"" references made by a Canadian minister about home minister Amit Shah.

Economic and political analysis

Ongoing dialogue on deportations

NEW DELHI: In response to recent US sanctions against Indian entities, the ministry of external affairs (MEA) affirmed on Saturday that India is actively engaging with American authorities to address concerns surrounding the measures. The sanctions, imposed by the US State Department, target 19 Indian companies and two individuals accused of allegedly supplying materials and technology to Russia, allegedly aiding its military in the ongoing Ukraine conflict .Randhir Jaiswal, MEA spokesperson , remarked on India's adherence to strict non-proliferation policies, saying, ""India has a robust legal and regulatory framework on strategic trade and nonproliferation controls. We are a member of key multilateral export control regimes and effectively implement relevant UNSC sanctions, including Resolution 1540 on non-proliferation.""Despite the US accusations, Jaiswal emphasized that the transactions in question do not violate Indian laws, underscoring India’s commitment to keeping its export control provisions updated and ensuring companies understand applicable restrictions. ""Our understanding is that the sanctioned transactions are not in violation of Indian laws. We are in touch with the US authorities to clarify issues,"" he added.The companies affected by the sanctions, such as Shreegee Impex Private Limited and TSMD Global, asserted that the sanctions would not affect their operations. Praveen Tyagi, director of Shreegee Impex, expressed confusion over the decision, saying, ""I don't know why these measures have been imposed on us. But it will not have any impact on us, because we neither import from the US nor export to the US""Rahul Kumar Singh, Director of TSMD Global, voiced similar sentiments, explaining, ""We are suppliers of automobile parts and agricultural implements, and we don't engage in any business with the US Our business with Russia will continue as usual.""Economists suggest the sanctions may signal a larger geopolitical message. Manoranjan Sharma, chief economist at Infomerics Ratings, commented on the timing, noting, ""This could be an attempt to influence the American elections on November 5. While it sends a message to both governments, it’s unlikely to have a significant impact on either India or Russia.""Sharma continued, ""These measures will have an extremely limited impact,"" downplaying any major strain on India-US relations amid an ongoing discussion on India’s policies concerning Sikh extremism issues.As part of India-US discussions, Jaiswal also touched on recent deportations of Indian nationals from the US “We have a regular dialogue with the United States on migration and mobility... facilitating the movement of people who are in the US illegally.

The minister said that the Narendra Modi-led government has fostered growth for the country on multiple fronts, while senior leaders of the Congress party don't pay attention to facts before expressing their ""misguided opinions"" publicly.The minister's remark adds to the war of words that has erupted between his party and Congress over ""unfulfilled"" poll promises . Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge on Friday claimed that “Modi ki guarantee” was a cruel joke on the people, while PM Modi latched on to the latter's advice to his state workers that they should be guided by ""fiscal viability"" and an unplanned approach could lead to financial difficulties.""Congress Party's classic shoot and scoot brand of social media policy based on lies, fabricated figures and fake data is back in action. Even their senior most leaders do not check facts before going public with their delusional opinions,"" the Union minister posted on X along with a graphic video.“Under leadership of PM @narendramodiJi, India has witnessed significant employment growth over the years. Employment has increased by nearly 36%, adding around 170 million jobs between 2016-17 and 2022-23.”“Let me also remind them that India’s economic trajectory demonstrates sustained job creation across key sectors. We are on our way to becoming the world’s 3rd largest economy very soon from the 11th spot their famed economists and policies left us in 2014,” he added.The oil minister said that the creation of both direct and indirect job opportunities for India's youth has contributed to an average GDP growth of more than 6.5 percent during this time. Puri claimed there are positive changes in employment, saying that the unemployment rate dropped to 3.2 percent in 2022-23.“According to PLFS, youth (age 15-29 years) unemployment rate has declined from 17.8 percent in 2017-18 to 10 percent in 2022-23. EPFO has reached 131.5 lakh in 2024 while Gig Economy workforce is expected to grow to 2.35 crore by 2029-30,” he wrote.The minister also said that agriculture sector remains dominant, employing over 45% of the workforce, which he claimed was a gradual shift toward manufacturing and services.Hitting out at Congress president Kharge over his allegations that the Central government had failed to fulfill their poll promises, the oil minister remarked that while Kharge perceives ‘stampedes,’ he is unable to see that the Worker Population Ratio has risen by nearly 26 percent from 2017 to 2023“He is clearly looking at all the wrong places and getting fake data, or maybe is just too preoccupied with trying to hold his imploding party together and buys whatever lies his advisors sell to him; or he is just too fixated with the ‘unemployment’ of his party’s travelling Shehzada,” he said.The tussle broke out when PM Modi, in a recent series of tweets, accused Congress of making empty promises during election campaigns. PM Modi on Friday said, ""The Congress Party is realizing the hard way that making unreal promises is easy, but implementing them properly is tough or impossible. Campaign after campaign, they promise things to the people, which they also know they will never be able to deliver.""PM Modi highlighted problems in Congress-ruled states, stating that the ""developmental trajectory and fiscal health are deteriorating"" in Karnataka, Himachal Pradesh, and Telangana. He claimed that Congress's unfulfilled promises were deceiving the poor, youth, farmers, and women, and that existing welfare schemes were being overlooked. Modi urged the public to remain alert against what he referred to as the ""Congress-sponsored culture of fake promises,"" citing the recent election results in Haryana as proof of the people's rejection of Congress.Reacting to the PM's charge, Kharge said that lies, deceit, fraud, loot and publicity are the five adjectives that best define the BJP government at the Centre.""Lies, Deceit, Fakery, Loot & Publicity are the 5 adjectives which best describe your Govt! Your drumbeating regarding a 100-day plan was a cheap PR stunt! On May 16, 2024, you also claimed that you took inputs from more than 20 lakh people for the road map for 2047.

Prashant Kishor explains why Jan Suraaj chose 'school bag' symbol: 'In 35 years of Lalu-Nitish rule ... ',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/prashant-kishor-explains-why-his-party-chose-school-bag-symbol-in-35-years-of-lalu-nitish-rule-/articleshow/114883963.cms,"NEW DELHI: Jan Suraaj supremo Prashant Kishore on Saturday criticised the 35-year rule of Lalu Yadav and Nitish Kumar , saying that it has stripped Bihar 's children of their school bags and replaced them with the burdens of labor. Kishor explained the significance of the school bag as his party's election symbol, saying that education is essential for ending poverty, creating jobs, and curbing migration.“In 35 years of Lalu-Nitish rule, the school bag has been removed from the backs of the children of Bihar, and a sack of labour has been tied on them,” Kishore declared.“The Jan Suraaj symbol is the school bag because the path to ending poverty, creating jobs, and stopping migration lies in education. Only through education can Bihar’s people develop and eradicate poverty,” he explained.The Election Commission recently allotted the “school bag” symbol to all four candidates fielded by Jan Suraaj in the Bihar by-elections scheduled for November 13. Alongside Ramgarh, by-polls will take place in Imamganj, Belaganj, and Tarari constituencies, following vacancies created earlier this year.Earlier at a rally in Ramgarh, Kishor had alleged that Bihar’s backwardness is partly due to the electorate's tendency to vote based on “jaat” (caste) and “bhaat” (free rations). Using a catchy rhyme to make his point, he urged people to break away from supporting parties solely for caste loyalty or minor handouts, stating that such voting patterns have fuelled chronic poverty and lack of progress. “Lalu Prasad and Chief Minister Nitish Kumar kept Bihar trapped in ‘jaat’ for 35 years,” he said. “For the past 10 years, Modi has been short-changing you in exchange for five kgs of ‘bhaat’.”Kishore accused both the state and central governments of failing to address the pressing needs of Biharis, particularly in education and economic opportunities. Critiquing Nitish Kumar’s governance, he accused the Chief Minister of replacing one form of “terror” with another. “The terror of criminals during Lalu’s era has been replaced by the terror of an unbridled bureaucracy,” he claimed, referring to the issues caused by recent mandatory smart pre-paid electricity meters and a disruptive land survey that, according to him, have further distressed the public.He also warned against voting for the BJP, which he claims has made clear it would support another term for Nitish Kumar in next year’s assembly polls. “If you support the BJP, it will strengthen the hands of Nitish, and your woes will continue,” he said.","Jan Suraaj supremo Prashant Kishore criticised the 35-year rule of Lalu Yadav and Nitish Kumar.

Cartridges are designed to be fired from firearms, and their presence on an aircraft is strictly prohibited due to security concerns.This incident comes amid a recent surge in threats targeting over 500 domestic and international flights, which, though all false alarms, have raised significant security concerns. The threats, reportedly spread across social media platforms, prompted swift action from aviation and digital authorities.In response, the ministry of civil aviation is considering implementing stricter countermeasures against hoax threats, including potentially adding perpetrators to no-fly lists.

Houses stand vacant, mere shadows of families who’ve sought refuge elsewhere. Only a few remain — mostly men — who now sleep outside on high cots stationed beneath the sprawling branches of a neem tree, taking turns to guard against a familiar creeping death: poisonous snakes.India leads the world in snakebite deaths, with nearly 58,000 lives lost annually out of 3-4 million bites — a statistic to which UP heavily contributes. Despite govt’s National Action Plan to curb snakebite deaths, ingrained practices continue to drive the toll higher as communities choose to count on traditional healers and methods rather than seek medical aid. When a TOI team fanned out in the UP hinterland to find out what countless citizens of the state were doing to battle snake bite incidents, it saw some startling rituals still much in vogue.In village after village, superstition often guided action (or the absence of it). In the town of Jehangirabad in Bulandshahr, when 22-yearold Mohit Kumar was bitten by a snake in April, his family suspended his body over the Ganga river, toes grazing the water. They believed that the venom would be drawn out by the current. He remained in that position there for two days — a ritual that concluded only with his cremation.Next door in Shahjahanpur , two children were buried alive in cow dung by their family in 2021 after being bitten by a snake, certain in the mystical healing power of dung. They died.National Centre for Disease Control ( NCDC ) recently launched National Action Plan for Prevention and Control of Snakebite Envenoming (NAPSE). According to NAPSE’s guidance document, “Only a small proportion of snakebite victims across countries report to clinics and hospitals and the actual burden of snakebite is grossly underreported.”","India leads the world in snakebite deaths, with nearly 58,000 lives lost annually out of 3-4 million bites.

NEW DELHI: Indian govt officially confirmed Saturday that ‘verification patrolling’ has commenced in Demchok and Depsang areas along the LAC, the two friction points in India-China military standoff in eastern Ladakh, where a disengagement agreement was finally reached on Oct 21, creating a potential pathway for normalisation of bilateral ties.Defence sources were quoted as saying on Friday that the Army had started patrolling at Demchok after informing Chinese army ( PLA ), in line with the patrolling arrangements finalised by both sides. The agreement led to the first formal bilateral meeting between PM Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping in Kazan (Russia) on Oct 23, on the margins of Brics summit.“You are aware that on Oct 21, 2024 the last phase of disengagement was agreed upon between India and China.

PLA, too, has begun its own patrols with prior information to us to prevent the possibility of any clash,” a defence source told TOI on Friday.In the meeting with Xi, welcoming the agreement for complete disengagement and resolution of issues that arose in 2020 with the most serious military flare-up in recent times, Modi had underscored the importance of properly handling differences and disputes and not allowing them to disturb peace and tranquillity.","Indian govt officially confirmed Saturday that ‘verification patrolling’ has commenced in Demchok and Depsang areas along the LAC.

GUWAHATI: Manipur 's Thadou community rejected the colonial-era classification & post-independence bureaucratic nomenclature designating it as a constituent of Kuki group, asserting that this label was arbitrarily imposed without its explicit consent.""Thadou is a distinct ethnic group, with our own distinct language, culture, traditions, and history. Thadou is not Kuki, or underneath Kuki, or part of Kuki, but a separate, independent entity,"" states the declaration of Thadou Convention 2024, which concluded Saturday in Guwahati. The convention said among all those touched by ethnic violence in Manipur since May 3 last year, Thadous were most affected.The state's sectarian strife has claimed over 225 lives and displaced around 60,000 people, creating a deep divide between Kuki-Zo tribal people of the hills and Meiteis of Imphal valley. The convention extended sympathy to survivors of the violence and their kin and affirmed its solidarity with Thadou people of Myanmar, who were affected by the ongoing political unrest in the country.It also affirmed that Thadou people constitute an independent, indigenous community among Manipur's 29 native tribes, as recognised by the 1956 Presidential Order. ""Thadous have always been known and recorded as Thadou, without any prefix or suffix to it, and it has been the single largest tribe in Manipur consistently since the first census of India in 1881 till the latest census in 2011 that recorded Thadou population at 2,15,913,"" the declaration states.It said Thadous reject and disown the term 'Kuki', which was ""coined by colonial rulers, supposedly known as a conglomerate of several constituent tribes, without which it is non-existent and irrelevant. The term has never been accepted by any of the other kindred tribes (Aimol, Gangte, Hmar, Kom, Mizo, Paite, Simte, Vaiphei, Zou, etc). Thus, any attempt to conflate or confuse Thadou identity with Kuki will be construed as the imposition of Kuki upon Thadous with divisive and malicious intentions, and it will never be acceptable to Thadou people""."," Manipur's Thadou community rejects colonial-era classification & post- independence bureaucratic nomenclature designating it as a constituent of Kuki group.

Same-Sex Dating: ‘Our twins have daddy and papa’: A portrait of gay fatherhood,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/our-twins-have-daddy-and-papa-a-portrait-of-gay-fatherhood/articleshow/114886838.cms,"We met almost 13 years ago through a same-sex dating website and felt an instant connection. Soon after, we started living together and with time our love blossomed. Five years into our relationship, we chose to come out, first to our sisters and then to our parents. It was a difficult reality for our middle class, small-town parents but with time and effort they understood our love and became our strongest support system.While we have distinct personalities, we have similar values. More than anything else, we both harboured a strong desire to be fathers. But we had no idea how or whether it would ever be possible. Our journey to fatherhood started when we got our first furry baby home and then the second. However, we continued to yearn to become fathers to human babies too. The pandemic made us realise the fragility of life and made us determined to not further delay our fatherhood journey . We shared this thought with our immediate families. They warned us to be completely sure of our decision as it was a life-changing one and had social implications too. Once they were sure of our determination, they wholeheartedly supported our decision and this meant a lot to us.After evaluating all possibilities, we chose to go for surrogacy. This was late 2020, more than a year before the surrogacy laws of the country were amended (single men and women are not allowed surrogacy since December 2021). We were blessed with a boy and girl in June 2021 and life changed forever. The memory of the day we first held them in our arms still leaves us with happy tears.From day one, we have been learning how to handle infants and with every passing day we keep getting better. Right from giving them a massage and a bath to feeding them at regular intervals (not to forget burping them after every feed) and singing lullabies while putting them to bed to getting them ready for school every morning, we learnt everything on the job. Both our parents were also elated to become grandparents. They have been of great help to us, both physically and mentally. Seeing our septuagenarian parents relive their childhood with our grandkids brings us extreme joy.Now, our babies are a little more than three years old. At every milestone of the journey, we have been absolutely open about our family and haven’t hidden anything from anyone. Yes, there have been occasional raised eyebrows and some fleeting comments here and there, but we have largely been well-accepted by people around us. One of the most beautiful experiences happened during the ‘Family Day’ function at our kids’ school when we stood on the stage and shared our story in front of more than 100 so-called conventional parents. Everyone in the audience appreciated our journey and till date we haven’t been treated differently by anyone at school.Another heartwarming experience was when our son, while watching an animated series on Bal Ganesha, shared with someone that like Ganeshji has Shivji and Parvati Mata, we have daddy and papa. Our babies are small now and we are sure someday we will have to explain our unconventional family to them. We hope to gradually introduce them to our story. We also realise they might have to answer some questions outside too and for that we are giving them the right upbringing and the value systems which will empower them to chart their journeys. As parents, we will always be with them and by them.We are extremely proud of our family. We live in Bengaluru with both sets of parents, our human babies and our furry babies under the same roof. It is a multicultural family as one of us is Bengali and one Punjabi . Our kids are growing up in a wholesome atmosphere. We celebrate Durga Pujo and Lohri with equal fervour. They speak Bengali, Hindi, English and a bit of Kannada too. They enjoy their fish curry as much as their kadi chawal.

Changing lives with stories

The storyteller of Tumkur





Connecting the dots

Saba Khan was five when she first began borrowing comic books from a neighborhood kirana shop in Bagh Dilkusha on the outskirts of Bhopal. She would thumb through Chacha Chaudhary and Natraj comics for one rupee an hour, racing against time to finish them before returning the worn-out copies. “I would finish them in a few minutes!” she recalls with the same excitement she felt as a child. But even then, a question gnawed at her — why should anyone pay to read?It was a question that lingered, even as Saba’s life unraveled around her. An accident involving her parents and other setbacks led to her dropping out in Class 8. Yet, her love for books never wavered.At the age of 14, Saba started her first free library in Bagh Farahat Afza. It was a modest setup where children from the community would gather to read. “Khud school nahi jaati aur doosron ko padhati hai (she doesn’t go to school but wants to teach others!),” the neighborhood gossiped. She wasn’t fazed. Every evening, that library — nothing more than a small, dimly lit room — came alive with young readers eager to escape into a world of stories.Last month in October, walking with Saba into the lanes of Bhopal’s Gandi Basti, also known as PC Nagar, was like stepping into a hidden pocket of Bhopal. The lanes were narrow but clean, lined with modest homes. With its tin roof, the makeshift library stood out against the modest surroundings. The walls were alive with colourful handmade newsletters and posters crafted by the children who visited regularly. Each poster spoke of the library’s impact, from quotes about books to childlike drawings of imagined worlds. Saba doesn’t just build libraries; she grooms the young librarians who run them, teaching them to nurture a community of readers. “The kids borrow books, go home, and start their own mini-libraries,” she says, smiling. One of them is Zoya , now 23, who started coming to the library as a curious 11-year-old. She now manages the PC Nagar library. Meanwhile, Saba’s work has expanded to a dozen libraries around Bhopal. Communities offered her spaces to run them. “On rainy days, families make sure the books stay dry, even if the rest of their house gets wet,” Saba tells me.This year, out of 56 applicants, 22 girls will head to college through the Savitri Bai-Fatima Shaikh fellowships offered by Saba’s network of libraries.Saba Khan is not alone in her quiet revolution. Across India, librarians like her are transforming the act of reading into something radical, something cool. From the small towns of Maharashtra to the rural corners of Karnataka, these librarians — many of them women — are reimagining what it means to hold a book, share knowledge, and bring communities together through the power of stories.During the Covid-19 pandemic, when schools all over India were closed, Nita Luthria , founder of the Adhyayan Foundation, started a Read-Aloud program in Goa to help children continue learning in a time of uncertainty. “The read-aloud creates a positive relationship with books and reading, especially for children from lower socio-economic backgrounds who tend not to have much exposure to books beyond textbooks,” says Nita.A tweet about this program caught the attention of Uma Mahadevan-Dasgupta, additional chief secretary, Panchayat Raj, in Karnataka. She invited Adhyayan to pilot the program in gram panchayat libraries across two districts. The initiative has now spread to 6,000 gram panchayat libraries across Karnataka. Many rely on them to prepare for competitive exams as well. Adhyayan Foundation, backed by EkStep’s Bachpan Manao, trains library supervisors to lead read-aloud sessions, shifting their role from bookkeepers to community leaders.In Galibeedu, Yashoda has noticed the shift in the library’s atmosphere since receiving training. “Before, the children would just hang around,” she recalls. “But now we have conversations. They ask questions, and we find answers together. I feel like I know how to engage with them.” This newfound connection between librarian and child has transformed the library from a passive space into a dynamic center of learning and dialogue.One story that stands out is that of Philomina, a teenage girl with a physical disability who was frustrated by her circumstances and disconnected from her studies. Her mother, who was struggling to manage her temper, confided in Padmavathi, the gram panchayat librarian of Nerugalale in Karnataka’s Kodagu district.Padmavathi began visiting the girl weekly, reading aloud to her in the comfort of her home. Slowly, these sessions became the highlight of the girl’s week. “Her mother said the girl had become happier thanks to those visits,” Nita shares.The reading aloud movement is shaping not just children, but also the librarians. Once unnoticed, they are now treated with respect and greeted warmly in their villages. “Children knock on their doors even when the library is closed,” she says. Librarians are even invited as guests of honour at village functions.Working across rural libraries in Kodagu, Varsha Vijaya Kumar , project manager for the Karnataka Read-Aloud Program at Adhyayan, admits there are challenges as well. Libraries often lack basic amenities like toilets, and in some areas, child marriages and poverty compound the struggle, making it difficult to convince families of the importance of reading and learning for girls. “There are days when I lose hope,” Varsha admits. “But then, I erase it all from my memory and start fresh the next day.”In Kalyan, Maharashtra, co-founder of non-profit SAJAG, Sajitha S K runs complementary learning centres and a library for children of urban communities who struggle with keeping up at school. The Enread programme at her library has become a tool for societal change. Last year, she held a reading of ‘ Mera Naam Gulab Hai ’ (My Name is Gulab), a story about a young girl confronting the injustice of her father’s work as a manual scavenger. The book by Sagar Kolvankar resonated deeply with the children, sparking a discussion on the dignity of labour.“The children realised the unfairness of the stigma attached to Gulab’s family,” says Sajitha. “They began to see that change is possible, and they could be part of it.” After reading My Name is Gulab, children in her community began practising waste segregation and even role-playing tasks once seen as shameful.In Tumkur, Karnataka, Vijiamma, who had once dreamed of becoming a lawyer, found her calling in the pages of the Ammanghata gram panchayat library. For 16 years, she managed the library, but it wasn’t until 2019, after she received training in the read-aloud program, that she truly found her voice as a storyteller.Now, it’s not just children who flock to the library. Narasimha Raju , a visually impaired farm worker, is a regular weekend visitor. After long days in the fields, Narasimha finds solace in reading. Vijiamma’s library offers a collection of Braille books — about a dozen in total — which have become a sanctuary for him. “After a week of farm work, reading is a stress buster for me,” Narasimha says.As Saba looks back, her thoughts turn to her mother who passed away a month ago. Growing up, she felt embarrassed that her parents were labourers instead of having ‘normal’ jobs. “Now, I feel ashamed that I ever felt that way,” she admits.Her mother didn’t fully grasp what NGOs were, but she proudly told others, “Meri beti bachchiyon ko kitaabon ke zariye taleem se jodne ka kaam karti hai (she helps connect girls to education through books).”Saba recalls an instance when girls from the Mehtar community were denied admission to a local school because of their caste. The teachers dismissed the girls as unworthy of education. “Their homes are so dirty,” the teachers at nearby Kasturba School scoffed. With Saba and the educators’ support, the girls returned to school the next day, demanding their right to study. The library had become more than just a place to read — it had become a place for fighting back against injustice.","Saba Khan started her first free library in Bagh Farahat Afza at the age of 14.

He will now fight to stay relevant and save his legacy in the state's political arena, especially in Kolhan region .Known as ""Kolhan Tiger"" and considered JMM 's undisputed face in the Kolhan region, Champai rebelled against JMM, claiming he was removed ""unceremoniously"" as CM on July 3 to make way for Hemant Soren. Champai willingly filled in for Hemant on Feb 2 this year after the latter was arrested by the ED and forced to resign.Champai will now fight for his new party, BJP , which he had fought earlier to keep it away from the Kolhan region, home to 14 assembly segments of which nine are reserved for STs and SCs.The game changed on Aug 30 this year, the day he joined BJP. He will now fight not only to secure his turf, Seraikela, which he has won six times since 1991, but to show the BJP brass that his sway over Kolhan can still provide other candidates in the region with victory. Seraikela, along with all other seats in Kolhan division, will vote on Nov 13. Champai is also working hard as he won Seraikela by a margin of a little over 15,000 votes in 2019.Talking to TOI, Champai said, ""I am not thinking too much about my political future but I have intensified campaigning. My association with voters for over 30 years will help me sail through.""""I said whatever I needed to when I made up my mind to exit the party. But I always maintained that I was not going to hurt the party which I had been part of for so long while exiting it.

In all these years of my public life I have developed a personal rapport with the people of my constituency and beyond. I have full faith in the people here."" Champai is now among the voices raking up the issue of Bangladeshi infiltration and what BJP claims is the state's changing demography, particularly in Santhal Pargana. JMM says the issue is a figment of BJP's imagination, a line Champai had supported in the past. On his ""deliberate silence on the issue all these years"", Champai said, ""Dukh tab bhi hota tha, dil jalta tha. Baki aap samajhdar hain.

‘Modi Ki Guarantee’ brings to fore Congress' credibility crisis: Trivedi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bjp-steps-up-attack-on-cong-over-poll-promises-kharge-hits-back/articleshow/114894735.cms,"New Delhi: In a fresh salvo aimed at Congress amid a war of words over election promises, BJP on Saturday emphasised the credibility of commitments made under PM Modi , contrasting it with what they described as Congress's ""crisis of credibility"".Party spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi said BJP had progressively expanded the scope of its welfare schemes - from health insurance to free grains and cash transfers for farmers - by first creating wealth and then distributing it as the Indian economy grew over the past decade.The rebuttal came a day after Congress president Mallikarjuna Kharge labeled ""Modi ki guarantee"" as a cruel jest. Union minister Hardeep Puri accused Kharge of spreading falsehoods and being obsessed with ""khana-kamana"" (eating and earning).""We believe in creating wealth first and then distributing it. Congress, however, stands for creating corruption and destroying wealth,"" Trivedi said, referencing numerous unfulfilled promises by Congress-governed states. Taking a jibe at Kharge's consistency, Trivedi said, ""Was Kharge speaking the truth on Friday or the day before?"" He suggested that Kharge's critique was a cover-up for his earlier comments on fiscal responsibility. Trivedi highlighted achievements under Modi, including the Ram temple construction, Article 370 revocation, building of over 14 crore houses for the poor, and India's firm stance against Pakistan on terrorism. He added that as a Congress veteran, Kharge has witnessed netas like P V Narasimha Rao and Pranab Mukherjee handle the economy skilfully under challenging conditions, yet now sees his party influenced by ""urban Naxals"" under Rahul Gandhi.Refuting Kharge's claims, Trivedi said EPFO data showed account holders had increased from 11 crore to 25 crore over a decade. Puri criticised Kharge for misinterpreting data, stating the worker-to-population ratio had risen by nearly 26% between 2017-2023. Puri urged Congress to stop relying on foreign perspectives and flawed indices like the Global Hunger Index. He said Kharge should not believe ""an Index which ranks India a country which is distributing dry rations to its more than 81 crore people at 105 (2024), while a country like Pakistan torn by internal strife at 109"".","BJP emphasises the credibility of commitments made under PM Modi.

JD Vance on Indian Food: What JD Vance said about Indian vegetarian food,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/when-i-first-started-dating-usha-what-jd-vance-said-about-indian-vegetarian-food/articleshow/114841564.cms,"Joe Rogan Experience #2221 - JD Vance

US Senator and Republican vice-presidential nominee JD Vance delved into his evolving views on food, particularly the appeal of Indian vegetarian cuisine , on his apperience on The Joe Rogan Experience . The conversation with Joe Rogan, which spanned three hours, offered insights not only into Vance's culinary journey but also into his marriage to Usha Vance .Rogan began the exchange by voicing scepticism about heavily processed plant-based meats, labelling them ""highly processed garbage"" and highlighting the health and environmental concerns often attached to such products. Instead, he championed traditional vegetarian food, specifically Indian cuisine, as a healthier and more flavourful option. “If you want to eat vegetables and be vegetarian, eat Indian food. They make really delicious vegetarian food,” Rogan stated.Vance, quick to agree, shared how his wife’s Indian heritage has opened him up to a world of vegetarian dishes he previously hadn’t considered. ""I'm married to an Indian-American . They make very good vegetarian food,"". As a self-described “meat and potatoes guy from Ohio,” Vance admitted that his initial forays into cooking for his wife were less than successful. Recalling an early attempt at impressing Usha with a homemade vegetarian meal, he said, ""I rolled out a flat thing of crescent rolls. I put raw broccoli on top of it. I sprinkled ranch dressing, and I stuck them in the oven for 45 minutes."" The result, he admitted, was ""disgusting.""Vance explained that he initially struggled to grasp what vegetarian meals could look like, particularly when he tried to cater to Usha’s preferences. Over time, he came to appreciate the wide variety and depth of flavours in Indian vegetarian cooking. ""If you're any vegetarian, eat paneer and rice and delicious chickpeas. Do not eat this disgusting fake meat,"" he remarked.Vance, a Catholic convert, has previously spoken about his respect for his wife’s Hindu upbringing, noting the nuances and compromises each has made in their relationship. In a prior interview with The New York Times, he expressed mixed emotions about introducing Usha to his faith, explaining that while she encouraged his spiritual journey, she has not converted to Catholicism herself. “She thought that [Catholic teachings] were good for me, in a sort of good-for-your-soul kind of way,” Vance revealed. He acknowledged feeling “kind of bad” about the change, explaining how Usha has had to shoulder responsibilities, particularly in church with their three children, even though she wasn’t raised in the faith.Their relationship, which began at Yale Law School and led to marriage in 2014.","US Senator and Republican vice-presidential nominee JD Vance delved into his evolving views on food, particularly the appeal of Indian vegetarian cuisine.

TOI correspondent from US:

From policy aide on Capitol Hill and technology advisor to President Obama, you have had diverse political experience. What are some of the important experiences that you will be taking with you, if elected to the US House of Representatives?

Immigration is an important issue for many Indians who live and work in the US. Will you be addressing immigration reforms?

Will you champion lifting of country quotas for green cards?

The Indian Americans in the US House of Representatives are informally called the Samosa Caucus – if elected you would be the sixth member of the group – do you think this is an important ‘lobby’ in the Congress with respect to the India-America relationship?

As state senator and as a candidate for Congress; what are the issues that you have highlighted?

Is your Indian heritage important for you?

Do you see many other young second generation Indian Americans like yourself choosing a career in public life, policy and politics?

Democrat Suhas Subramanyam , a state senator in Virginia, is not a newbie in US politics and was first elected to the state’s legislative body (general assembly) in 2019 as a state delegate. Now running for the US House of Representatives from Virginia’s 10th district, he is tipped to become the sixth member of the ‘ Samosa Caucus ’ of Indian American lawmakers in the US Congress . The state senator, whose parents immigrated to the US to pursue the American dream, has earlier been a staffer on Capitol Hill (the seat of US government) and served in the White House as advisor to President Barack Obama . Subramanyam, who has been endorsed for the House of Representatives seat by incumbent Democratic Congresswoman Jennifer Wexton, spoke to Ishani Duttagupta of the Times of India, on a range of issues including his support for immigration reform and the role his Indian American background has played in shaping his political views. Edited excerpts from the interview.I will be taking all my experiences with me to the US House - from advisor to President Obama to advisor on Capitol Hill and a member of the community in Virginia, who has roots here and has served as state senator. I think it is important that we listen to our constituents and be responsive to some of their needs. I think that is the most important of my experiences – my time in the community.Immigration is a personal issue for me. My family came to the US in the late 70s and it took them only three months to get a green card. Now it takes some people as long as 15 to 20 years and many are even telling me that it will be a lifetime wait, and they may never get a green card because of the antiquated immigration system that we operate under. I would like to see comprehensive immigration reform. There is a lot of talk about border security; which is fine. I support border security; but we need to talk more about legal immigration. Especially about what we are going to do about people who are on visas like the H-1B. I would like to see us lift the country quotas which I think will be especially good for Indian Americans and a lot of other immigrants from other countries too. I don’t think those quotas are fair. Even if we disagree with what to do about undocumented immigrants; we should agree on border security and legal immigration and try to move those things forward.Right now in my community there are a lot of people who came on H-1B visas, to work mostly in the technology field, and there are other programmes for agricultural workers that are mostly from Mexico or central America who come here legally to help with seasonal work on temporary visas. Both groups should have a path to citizenship especially because of their tremendous contribution to our economy and country. Without them we would be in a very difficult situation, economically.I come from an immigrant family that has benefitted from a system where people had a quicker path to citizenship and perhaps that gives me a biased view. I want to make sure that a legal immigration path to citizenship is available for people who are on these work visas. I think that it will be good for our country in the long term.I am proud to be Indian American, though it’s not what I lead with when explaining why I am running for the elections. But it is something that I consider to be very important to my story – and it’s also something that has shaped me. I was raised Indian American and went to India as a kid; but with that said I look at things from the US perspective predominantly. A strong US-India relationship is good for both the countries and this world. So even with my strong connection to India from my heritage, I also look at the situation objectively and feel that a strong US-India relationship benefits us in the US tremendously. I think that the policy can be best furthered by economic relationships rather than arms deals. The economic relationship between US and India is incredible and powerful. In the long-term, I do see the US having defence co-operation with India; but what makes the relationship strong and powerful are the economic ties. I want to continue on the path to those and improve on them.I have always focussed on economic issues as member of the Virginia General Assembly. I worked very hard on bringing down the cost of prescription drugs. I also tried to make sure that utility bills didn’t over-charge customers. Where I live, there are very high tolls on roads; I passed legislation to prevent further increases. I have always cared a lot about the cost of living here, and that seems to be one of the top issues in this election. I also care about making sure we have access to healthcare. Right now, women are specially concerned about reproductive rights in America; my focus is certainly to support reproductive rights but also to bring down the cost of healthcare generally, so more people have access to good healthcare. That has always been my concern.Education is also something that is very important to me. I want to make sure that schools have all the funds that they need. Here a lot of teachers are underpaid and can’t afford to live in our community. I want to make sure that there is more affordable housing and better pay for teachers so that we can afford to retain them.I celebrate all Indian holidays and also have family that still lives in India. So, I do have a bond with that country naturally. We also have a growing Indian population in my district and they understand the historic nature of my candidacy – the first ever Indian American in Congress from the East coast. But I also want to make sure that the people in my constituency are my priority and that the economy that we have here is strong with a focus on healthcare and education. I want people here to be empowered and have a voice.I do see a change and it’s happening pretty quickly – we’re seeing that we could have an Indian American President and there are also people on the Republican side who have run for president. We are also seeing Indian Americans run and win at the local level which I think is very important. And certainly at the state level, after I was elected, there have been others elected as well. I think it is important to get engaged and involved politically. When my parents came to the US, they had to think of how to make ends meet and how to survive in this place. They told me to pick a profession that is stable. But I understand that this as one way of giving back to the community. And now other Indian Americans are also seeing it that way which is why we are seeing more running for offices. I want to help and encourage Indian Americans and other South Asians including Nepalese, Pakistanis and Bangladeshis to run for Congress and achieve better representation. While I could be the sixth or seventh member of the ‘Samosa Caucus’, in long term I feel there should be more of us becoming a part of political process, and they don’t necessarily always have to win elections. It is important to make our voice matter, next week and later as well.","Democrat Suhas Subramanyam is running for the US House of Representatives from Virginia’s 10th district.

Both players have dominated the number one ranking since April 2022.The WTA Finals, running for a week, offer a significant prize and 1,500 points. Sabalenka aims to secure her ranking by winning three round-robin matches or reaching the final. Swiatek must defend her WTA Finals title to surpass Sabalenka.Sabalenka said,""Yeah, that's definitely one of the goals,"" said Sabalenka.""I've always been saying that for me it's about finishing the year as the world number one. I'll do everything I can to finish the year as world number one.""... Anytime we come to the tournament, we want to win. That's the first goal. I'm trying to be focused on the first part. Then, if I'll be able to finish the year as number one, it'll be amazing and I'll be super happy.""Swiatek remarked, ""Obviously we're both fighting for this spot. It's been us basically, over the past few years,"" Swiatek said.""I'm in the tournament. I want to play my best and win. I'm going to focus on my first match and do everything step by step.""She's a great player. She also deserves to be number one. For sure, I'm going to fight for me to be in that place.""Sabalenka holds a 1,046-point lead over Swiatek, who has not played since her US Open exit in September. Swiatek has since hired a new coach, Wim Fissette, ahead of the tournament.Other participants include Zheng Qinwen , Jasmine Paolini, Jessica Pegula, Coco Gauff , Elena Rybakina , and Barbora Krejcikova.Elena Rybakina, dealing with health issues, also aims to make a strong comeback, and Zheng Qinwen, in good form, will face Sabalenka early in the tournament.Zheng commented, ""The trickiest part for me right now is how to really find a way to break through the wall and beat her.""The WTA Finals have sparked significant controversy in recent months following Riyadh's selection as the host city through 2026.In recent years, Saudi Arabia has made substantial investments in various sports, including football, Formula One, and golf. Critics argue that the nation is employing its Public Investment Fund to ""sportswash"" its human rights record.The Saudi government refutes these claims of human rights violations, asserting that its laws are designed to safeguard national security.WTA chief Steve Simon acknowledged last year that hosting women's tour events in Saudi Arabia posed ""big issues,"" yet he also recognized the progress the country has made and emphasised ongoing discussions with players prior to finalising the WTA Finals agreement.""Our decision was made with full consultation with our players and our tournaments,"" WTA CEO Portia Archer said. ""That led to the decision to come here and being comfortable with it.""... We think it'll support women in tennis and enable some very positive things to come out of us being here that will last well beyond the eight days we're here this year and successively the next two years when we host the tournament here.""Additionally, tennis legends Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova have voiced concerns, stating that the WTA's values diverge from those of Saudi Arabia.Gauff believes bringing the WTA Finals to Saudi Arabia can ""open doors"" and inspire positive change for women in the country, although the world number three admitted: ""I'd be lying to you if I said I had no reservations"".Gauff, 20, admits she had reservations about the idea of staging the WTA Finals in Saudi Arabia and wanted to see for herself what kind of progress is being made.""Obviously I'm very aware of the situation here in Saudi. My view on it is I do think that sport can have a way to open doors to people. I think in order to want change, you have to see it. I think sports for me, I would say is the easiest way to introduce that,"" said the American star.""I would be lying to you if I said I had no reservations. I was pretty much on every player call I could make with the WTA. One of the things I said, if we come here, we can't just come here and play our tournament and leave. We have to have a real program or real plan in place.""Gauff said the calls included conversations with Princess Reema bint Bandar Al Saud, the Saudi Arabian ambassador to the United States, in which Gauff asked questions about LGBTQ+ and women's rights in the country.""In the long run I think it could be better for everybody,"" said the American.""It's one of those things where I want to see it for myself, see if the change is happening. If I felt uncomfortable or felt like nothing's happening, then I probably wouldn't come back.""The WTA Finals, featuring the top eight singles players and doubles teams, begins in Riyadh and will conclude on November 9.For the first time, the WTA Finals will be contested in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia at King Saud University Indoor Arena. Riyadh will host the next two editions of the WTA Finals as well, until 2026.Aryna Sabalenka, Jasmine Paolini, Elena Rybakina, Zheng QinwenIga Swiatek, Coco Gauff, Jessica Pegula, Barbora KrejcikovaLyudmila Kichenok/Jelena Ostapenko, Hsieh Su-Wei/Elise Mertens, Nicole Melichar-Martinez/Ellen Perez, Katerina Siniakova/Taylor TownsendGabriela Dabrowski/Erin Routliffe, Sara Errani/Jasmine Paolini, Caroline Dolehide/Desirae Krawczyk, Chan Hao-Ching/Veronika KudermetovaThe singles champion will pocket no less $4.45 million of the overall prize money of $15.25 million. If a player goes unbeaten towards the title, they could earn as much as $5.15 million. In comparison, in 2019, Ash Barty had won $4.42 million in what was a huge moment for women's tennis as it moved to Shenzhen.The singles and doubles competitions will take place in a round-robin format. The players and teams will play each other(s) once and the top two in singles/doubles will advance to the semi-finals. The top player/team from each group will face the No. 2 placed player/team in the other group.","WTA Finals in Riyadh will see the top-eight singles players and doubles teams vie for the season-ending title.

The Margao Municipal Council (MMC) is considering terminating the service of its lower division clerk, Yogesh Shetkar , three months after he was suspended. Shetkar is on the run after he was found to have misappropriated Rs 17 lakh from the revenue earned by the MMC through feast fair stalls.MMC chairperson Damodar Shirodkar said that the focus of the municipality was on trying to recover the money from Shetkar at the earliest.“Of the Rs 17 lakh that was found to have been siphoned off by him, Rs 3 lakh has been recovered,” Shirodkar said.“We are also exploring the option of recovering the rest of the money through his pension funds or other such avenues. We have sought a legal opinion , including on the termination of his service.”Though Shetkar was directed to report to the MMC during the period of his suspension, he has remained untraceable since. Police are also on his lookout as an offence was booked against him at the Margao town police station. Despite a lookout circular being issued against him, Shetkar has so far succeeded in evading the police radar.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

A greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/exemptions is the need of the hour.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
'Made me who I am today': Kamala Harris draws strength from mother's journey from India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/made-me-who-i-am-today-kamala-harris-draws-strength-from-mothers-journey-from-india/articleshow/114900452.cms,"US vice president and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris paid tribute to her late mother, Dr Shyamala Gopalan Harris , an Indian immigrant whose courage and dedication to her family continue to inspire her just days ahead of the November 5 elections. Harris reflected on the values her mother instilled in her, from honoring her heritage to championing causes that make a difference—a legacy she says drives her vision for America today.“My mother, Dr Shyamala Gopalan Harris, came to the United States from India alone at the age of 19,” Harris wrote in a post, sharing a cherished photo of her younger self alongside her mother. “Her courage and determination made me who I am today.”Through an op-ed in South Asian publication The Juggernaut, Harris recounted her family’s journey from India to America and the legacy of courage, sacrifice, and ambition that her mother instilled in her. The story of Shyamala, who arrived in the United States alone at 19 to pursue a graduate degree in California, is central to Harris’s own life and career.Growing up, Harris says she and her sister Maya were raised with a deep appreciation for their Indian heritage. Their mother made it a point to take them to India nearly every other year, especially during Diwali, a time filled with family gatherings and rituals. “Growing up, my mother raised my sister and me to appreciate and honor our heritage. Nearly every other year, we would go to India for Diwali. We would spend time with our grandparents, our uncles, and our chitthis,” Harris shared.She added, ""And as Vice President, it has been my honor to host Diwali celebrations in my home - the Vice President's Residence. Not only to celebrate the holiday, but to celebrate the rich history, culture, and heritage of the South Asian American diaspora, which is bound together by a shared sense of possibility and belief in the promise of America,""In her op-ed, Harris detailed the ambitions that drove her mother: to raise her daughters with integrity and to make strides in the fight against breast cancer. “My mother had two goals in her life: to raise her two daughters, my sister Maya and me, and to cure breast cancer,” Harris wrote.She fondly recalled trips to India as a child, particularly to visit her grandfather, PV Gopalan, a retired civil servant in Chennai (then Madras). Harris often joined him on long morning walks along the beach, where he spoke passionately about democracy, justice, and the importance of standing up for one’s beliefs. “Those lessons first inspired my interest in public service,” she wrote, noting that her grandfather’s influence continues to guide her today as both Vice President and presidential candidate.As Election Day came closer, Harris highlighted her commitment to ensuring healthcare equity for all Americans—a mission closely tied to her mother’s legacy as a cancer researcher and the struggles she endured battling cancer herself. “South Asian Americans are often overlooked by our healthcare system, especially with conditions like heart disease and diabetes,” Harris wrote.Addressing the issue of immigration, Harris articulated a vision for an immigration system that balances security with compassion. “I reject the false choice between securing our border and creating a system of immigration that is orderly and humane,” she wrote. Harris voiced support for a bipartisan border security bill aimed at curbing illegal crossings while also protecting immigrants, many of whom, she noted, come from communities like hers.On foreign policy, Harris drew a sharp contrast with her Republican opponent , Donald Trump, critiquing his record on diplomacy and commitment to US alliances. “As Vice President, I have expanded our relationships with key South Asian partners, including India,” she said. Unlike Trump, whom she described as “unfit” due to his connections with authoritarian leaders, Harris pledged to reinforce America’s alliances and uphold its leadership on the world stage.Harris’s mother Shyamala Gopalan arrived in California in the early 1960s, where she met Jamaican economist Donald Harris during the fervent days of the civil rights movement.Born in 1964, Kamala Harris grew up amid a climate of activism and social change, often attending marches with her mother. After her parents’ divorce, she was primarily raised by her mother, who worked long hours and kept a tight budget.Harris often recalls how her mother would sit late at night with a cup of tea, sorting through bills and ensuring that her daughters would have a future that was stable and fulfilling.","US Vice President and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris paid tribute to her late mother, Dr Shyamala Gopalan Harris.

Ed Sheeran's 'Thinking Out Loud' prevails in copyright appeal over 'Let's Get It On',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/ed-sheerans-thinking-out-loud-prevails-in-copyright-appeal-over-lets-get-it-on/articleshow/114899510.cms,"A federal appeals court Friday ruled that Ed Sheeran 's 2014 song ' Thinking Out Loud ' did not infringe on the copyright of Marvin Gaye's classic ' Let's Get It On .'In a 28-page decision, a three-judge panel from the US Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit in New York affirmed a lower court's ruling that the songwriting copyright in 'Let's Get It On' (1973) was limited to the skeletal sheet music that the song's publishers had deposited with the US Copyright Office. Additional musical elements in the song's recording - including guitar and drum parts, and its distinctive bass line - were therefore not protected by copyright, the judges found.They rejected arguments from Structured Asset Sales, a music investment company that owns an 11.1% interest in 'Let's Get It On,' that the song's four-chord pattern was original enough to have a copyright. Not only is it commonplace in many songs, the judges said, but the chords' ""selection and arrangement"" in a syncopated pattern was also not original.The appeal was being watched by copyright scholars, who have said the ""deposit copy"" rule, which limits protection for older works to what was written down, rather than what was recorded in a studio, had become out of step with how music has been made in the modern era. The rule was established by the 1909 Copyright Act.A key dispute had been whether the ""scope"" of the copyright in 'Let's Get It On' - exactly which parts of the song were protected by law - was defined by its written deposit copy or whether jurors could also consider additional elements from Gaye's recording. The district judge, citing a similar case involving Led Zeppelin's 'Stairway to Heaven,' ruled that only the written notes on the deposit copy were part of the copyright. Lawyers for Sheeran argued that the syncopated chord pattern of 'Thinking Out Loud' predated 'Let's Get It On' and was generic enough not to be protected by copyright.As the commercial recording of 'Let's Get It On' could not be played at trial, jurors heard an electronic ""realisation"" of the tune with robotic voice.","A federal appeals court Friday ruled that Ed Sheeran's 2014 song'Thinking Out Loud'did not infringe on the copyright of Marvin Gaye's classic'Let's Get It On.

Gold reserves play a crucial role in a nation’s financial stability, serving as a valuable asset for central banks and governments. These reserves, which refer to the stockpile of gold held by a country, help stabilise currency values and provide security during economic uncertainties. Historically, gold has been seen as a safe-haven asset, essential during times of crisis or financial downturns.For example, the U.S. began building its substantial reserves in the late 19th century and solidified its dominance through the Gold Reserve Act of 1934. Today, countries around the world hold significant amounts of gold as part of their strategic economic policies. Explore the top countries with the highest gold reserves, based on the latest data from the World Gold Council, showcasing their holdings and economic impact.The U.S. holds the highest gold reserves at approximately 8,133.46 tonnes, which make up about 72.41% of its total reserves. Stored in secure facilities like Fort Knox, these reserves bolster financial stability and reinforce the U.S. dollar's dominance in international trade.Germany ranks second with 3,351.53 tonnes, accounting for about 71.46% of its foreign reserves. Most of its gold is kept in vaults in Frankfurt and some repatriated from New York and London. Germany’s substantial holdings provide a buffer against financial crises and elevate its influence within the EU.Italy’s 2,451.84 tonnes of gold reserves, managed by its central bank, represent 68.33% of its total foreign reserves. These assets serve as a symbol of economic resilience, supporting Italy's stability within the Eurozone.France holds 2,436.97 tonnes, constituting 69.99% of its reserves. Managed by the Banque de France, these holdings provide financial security and reflect a longstanding strategy to mitigate economic risks.With 2,335.85 tonnes of gold, Russia has significantly increased its reserves as a strategic response to geopolitical challenges and to diversify away from the U.S. dollar. This approach strengthens its economic resilience.China’s 2,264.32 tonnes of gold, making up 4.91% of its reserves, demonstrate its gradual shift to diversify assets and reduce reliance on the U.S. dollar, supporting economic stability and policy flexibility.Japan’s gold holdings total 845.97 tonnes (5.15% of its reserves), used mainly as a hedge against economic volatility and inflation.India holds 840.76 tonnes, which account for 9.57% of its foreign reserves. Gold's cultural importance and the Reserve Bank of India's proactive strategies underline its value as a financial stabiliser.The Netherlands’ 612.45 tonnes (61.61% of its reserves) underscore its commitment to monetary stability, with most gold stored within national vaults.With 584.93 tonnes, Turkey has increased its reserves in recent years, now comprising a significant portion of its total foreign reserves. The nation’s growing mining potential could further bolster its economic position.","Gold reserves play a crucial role in a nation’s financial stability, serving as a valuable asset for central banks and governments.

MAGA meltdown over Indians stealing jobs as racial abuse mounts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/maga-meltdown-over-indians-stealing-jobs-as-racial-abuse-mounts/articleshow/114888886.cms,"(Reuters file photo)

TOI Correspondent from Washington:

Cherrypicking data from the latest Bureau of Labor Statistics jobs report during a heated election campaign, some pro-Trump economists and the MAGA media are alleging foreign-born workers are scoring ""nearly all job gains"" at the expense of native-born Americans amid a toxic undercurrent of resentment and racial abuse of Indian tech community .“Over the last year, native-born Americans have lost almost 800,000 jobs while foreign-born workers have gained over 1 million jobs; the US labor market is turning into a temp agency for foreign workers and govt bureaucrats,” Heritage Foundation Economist E J Antoni wrote in a post on X that some MAGA activists portrayed as part of the ""great replacement theory"" to sideline native-born Americans with immigrants.According to Antoni's reading of the report, native-born Americans have fewer jobs today than before the pandemic (-873k), while all net job growth has gone to foreign-born workers (+3.7 million). ""Many Americans aren't happy w/ the economy b/c they're not the ones w/ the jobs,"" he wrote.But the October jobs report actually shows employment rose for native-born workers and fell for foreign-born workers during the month, although over the past year, employment has fallen by 773,000 for native workers and risen by 1 million for the foreign-born.The MAGA media, notably Breitbart Report , which has long carried on a crusade against foreign skilled workers, particularly H1B visa holders from India, segued the analysis into Trump's recent comment -- “So foreigners coming in illegally, largely illegally into our country, took the jobs of native-born Americans and I’ve been telling you that’s what’s going to happen"" -- to argue that all immigrants are taking jobs that could and should go to native-born Americans.It cited a Pew Research Center study that found that as of 2022, more than 30 million legal immigrants and illegal aliens were holding US jobs — a 20-percent increase over the last 15 years -- which incidentally also includes four Trump years. During the same period, the number of native-born Americans who have been added to the workforce increased by less than 10 percent, taking the native-born work force to 130.8 million.The tirade against foreign workers, illegal or legal, comes amid intense trolling on social media of Indian and Indian-origin tech workers and executives, even if they are US citizens. Over the weekend, Sheel Mohnot, a San Francisco fintech executive, posted a screenshot of comments his recent post on a mostly Patel-run bank in Texas attracted. They included ""They all go back to India next year,"" ""All need to be deported back to their shithole,"" ""We will seize all their assets and send them all back to Gujarat"" and ""I can only imagine how their office smells.""Not everyone joined the verbal lynchmob. Several Americans defended Mohnot. ""f*** em. hit them with the haymaker,"" one of them wrote, with a data-chart that showed Indian-Americans with the highest median household income in the US ($100,500), almost double that of white-Americans ($ 59,900). Indian-Americans also have the highest percentage of bachelor's degree holders -- 70 percent compared to the national average of 28 percent.","Some pro-Trump economists and the MAGA media are alleging foreign-born workers are scoring ""nearly all job gains"" at the expense of native-born Americans.
