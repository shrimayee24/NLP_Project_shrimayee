The defence ministry has granted the Army Chief expanded authority to mobilise the Territorial Army amid heightened tensions with Pakistan. Under Rule 33 of the Territorial Army Act, 1948, the Army Chief can call upon all officers and enrolled personnel of the Territorial Army to provide essential security or supplement regular Army operations. But what is the Territorial Army?After the 1857 revolt, the British reorganised local militia into volunteer forces, which saw action in overseas conflicts like the Second Boer War and World War I.In 1920, the Indian Territorial Force was established, which is the direct precursor to today’s Territorial Army.After Independence, the need for a homegrown citizens’ army was recognised and the Territorial Army Act was passed in Aug 1948. Indian Territorial Army was inaugurated on Oct 9, 1949, envisioned as a volunteer reserve force of “citizen soldiers” who would serve part-time in defence of the nation. The primary motive was to create a second line of defence that could be mobilised in emergencies. By allowing civilians to serve in uniform on a part-time basis, India’s leaders sought to harness the patriotism and skills of ordinary citizens for national defence.TA is a volunteer force comprising professionals, businessmen, and others who undergo military training in their spare time. Applicants must be Indian citizens, 18-42 years old and be medically fit. TA personnel train for about two months every year.An Army Order in 1984 succinctly described the TA’s role as: To “relieve the regular Army from static duties and assist civil administration in dealing with natural calamities and maintenance of essential services, and to provide units for the regular Army as and when required”. In practice, this means the TA is tasked to:➤ Augment the Army’s manpower in war➤ Bolster counterinsurgency operations and maintain law and order in troubled areas➤ Ensure critical services (like railways, telecommunications, etc) continue running during war or emergencies➤ Assist civil authorities during natural disasters (floods, earthquakes, cyclones) or other emergenciesOften nicknamed the “Terriers”, TA units have helped out on several occasions:Soon after inception, TA units were involved in supplementary roles during the first Indo-Pak conflict in Kashmir (1947–48) and the border skirmishes preceding the 1962 Sino-Indian War. During the 1962 hostilities, TACurrent strength of Territorial Army, comprising 65 units across India was fully mobilised. They provided logistical support in the Himalayas and manned defensive positions in rear areas.In both the IndoPakistani wars the TA was again called upon en masse. TA battalions performed vital combat support and logistics roles alongside the Army.The TA was deployed in Operation Rakshak, supporting counter-insurgency operations first in Punjab (against Sikh militancy) and later in Jammu & Kashmir (against Pakistan-backed militants). TA soldiers carried out patrols, manned checkpoints, and protected infrastructure in these states. In the late 1980s, Operation Pawan saw the Indian Peace Keeping Force in Sri Lanka (1987–1990) battling Tamil insurgents. TA units were sent to Sri Lanka as part of this mission, primarily in logistical and support roles to the peacekeeping troops.They secured rear zones, ammunition depots, and lines of supply during the Kargil conflict.","The Territorial Army was established in 1949. It is a volunteer reserve force of ‘citizen soldiers’ who serve part-time in defence of the nation. Applicants must be Indian citizens, 18-42 years old and be medically fit. TA personnel train for about two months every year.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121047631,imgsize-1347958,width-400,resizemode-4/article-64.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Following Pakistan's repeated failure to breach India's air defence, Pakistan army chief General Asim Munir may engineer terror attacks inside India.Sources said the possibility of Munir, who as ISI chief scripted the 2019 Pulwama suicide attack, ordering Pakistan's terror proxies to carry out such strikes was real, adding India was ramping up its defences to prevent them.The sources pointed to the presence of senior Pakistan army personnel at the funeral of terrorists who were killed in India's strikes on nine terror camps in Pakistan and POK on the night of May 6-7. ""It was quite a moment when they dropped the fiction of terrorists being non-state actors; that too, when the global spotlight is trained on them. While it may signal defiance, it underlined their compulsion not to offend the jihadis they have raised and trained to hurt India,"" said a senior source. He also said that for Pakistan to desert terrorists at a time when they are grieving, fearful and, perhaps, thirsting for revenge would amount to abandoning their favourite weapon against India.As per the estimate of the security establishment here, the risk of terrorists trying to set off fresh attacks has risen also because of India’s success in neutralising the efforts to breach its air defence and target its military facilities over the past 48 hours. “They may fall back on the default option of using terror proxies to compensate for the failure of their forces,” a senior govt functionary involved in decision-making said. “Tragic aberrations like the Pahalgam massacre notwithstanding, India has been very successful in thwarting terror attacks over the past 10 years. But now we have to brace for a higher level of desperation,” he said.","Pakistan army chief General Asim Munir may engineer terror attacks inside India.

NEW DELHI: Given the evolving conflict situation since the launch of ' Operation Sindoor ' by India against Pakistan in response to the killing of 26 tourists at Pahalgam, Supreme Court on Friday told the Centre that the time is not right for the discharge of 69 short service commission officers (SSCOs), including 47 women.""In the prevailing situation, let us not bring their morale down.They are brilliant officers. Their services can be used somewhere else. This is not the time to force them to roam the corridors of the Supreme Court. They can be somewhere else to serve the country,"" said a bench of Justices Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh.Additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati said it is an administrative decision to discharge SSCOs who, after completing 14 years of service, are not found fit for permanent commission (PC). ""This is based on a policy to keep the armed forces young,"" she said.Appearing for Lt Col Geeta Sharma , senior advocate Menaka Guruswamy said the administrative decision could not be discriminatory and that when there are vacancies in PC officers' posts, there is no reason why SSCOs like Sharma are not granted PC. Guruswamy cited the example of Col Sofiya Qureshi, who fought a legal battle to get PC and is now seen briefing the media about the Operation Sindoor.The bench said the question before the court is purely a legal one and has nothing to do with individual officers. However, it stayed the discharge of SSCOs till Aug 6-7, when the court would hear the petitioners and the govt in detail.Bhati informed the court that Sharma, commissioned in the Corps of Signals in March 2011, was considered for permanent commission in Dec 2020 and was found fit for four-year extension of service.For her batch of 204 SSCOs, 77 technical and 127 non-technical, there were 119 vacancies of permanent commission. PC was granted to 118 SSCOs, and a four-year extension to 56 others. In all, 30 batchmates of Sharma were released from service from March 18. However, the release of eight female SSCOs has been stayed.

NEW DELHI: The central government on Thursday opened two gates at the Baglihar Hydroelectric Power Project in Ramban and three gates at the Salal Dam in Reasi.This reportedly aimed at managing rising water levels triggered by heavy rainfall in the region and also to manage dam pressure.The development comes just days after the Chenab's water levels had dropped sharply, following the government's decision to restrict the river’s flow, an unprecedented action that led to stretches of the riverbed becoming walkable for the first time in recent memory in some downstream areas.The regulation of the Chenab’s flow is being widely viewed as a strategic signal of India’s ability to control water releases, especially in the context of mounting tensions with Pakistan.The decision to restrict the river’s flow followed the Centre’s suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) with Pakistan, announced in the aftermath of the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 civilians, including several tourists.Under the IWT, India is obligated to notify Pakistan before making any significant interventions in the flow of western rivers like the Chenab.However, with the treaty now suspended, India has acted unilaterally to manage the river's waters, both in terms of withholding and releasing them as per domestic needs.",Central government opens two gates at the Baglihar Hydroelectric Power Project in Ramban.

As she lists one mansion, Taylor Swift transforms another possibly for life with Travis Kelce

After taking some well-earned time off, Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift are slowly easing back into their busy schedules. Following the Kansas City Chiefs ’ Super Bowl loss to the Philadelphia Eagles in February and the conclusion of Taylor’s monumental “The Eras Tour,” the couple took a step back from the spotlight to relax and reconnect in private.As Taylor Swift renovates her Rhode Island mansion into a potential family home, Kelce is back to training for what could be his final NFL season while also upgrading his lifestyle to match their evolving relationship.Taylor Swift is already focused on her next musical chapter, with a new album in development and plans reportedly underway for a 2026 tour, according to sources. Meanwhile, she’s also making moves in real estate, listing her former Cape Cod mansion owned briefly between 2012 and 2013 for sale.The most notable step is Taylor Swift’s decision to renovate her $17.75 million mansion in Watch Hill, Rhode Island. This historic 12,000-square-foot estate, perched on a scenic coastal cliff, is undergoing a $1.7 million transformation to become a primary residence. The upgrades include expanding the bedroom suite and lounge by 400 square feet, redesigning the kitchen, and adding a new bedroom.The living room is also being remodeled, and the front portico will be reconstructed. Permits were quietly filed in late 2024, with construction expected to finish by the end of 2025. Sources suggest Taylor Swift envisions this property as a future family retreat with Kelce.Now, as the off-season winds down, Travis Kelce is back at the Chiefs’ training facility, gearing up for what many believe could be his final NFL season.

Explained: Why India abstained instead of voting no on IMF Pakistan loan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/explained-why-india-abstained-instead-of-voting-no-on-imf-pakistan-loan/articleshow/121039577.cms,"India abstained from voting on IMF loan package for Pakistan

Decision-making at the IMF

The IMF executive board consists of 25 directors who represent member countries or groups of countries. It handles daily operational matters, including loan approvals.

Unlike in the United Nations , where each country has one vote, IMF voting power reflects the economic size of each member. For instance, countries like the United States hold a disproportionately high voting share. Thus to simplify things, the IMF typically makes decisions by consensus.

, where each country has one vote, IMF voting power reflects the economic size of each member. For instance, countries like the United States hold a disproportionately high voting share. Thus to simplify things, the IMF typically makes decisions by consensus. In cases where a vote is required, the system does not allow a formal ""no"" vote. Directors can either vote in favor or abstain. There is no provision to vote against a loan or proposal.

Why India abstained?

India questioned the effectiveness of ongoing IMF assistance, noting that Pakistan has received support in 28 of the past 35 years including four programs in just the last five without meaningful or lasting reform.

India strongly highlighted the Pakistani military’s continued dominance in economic affairs, which undermines transparency, civilian oversight, and sustainable reform.

India firmly opposed providing funds to a country that continues to sponsor cross-border terrorism, warning that such support carries reputational risks for global institutions and undermines international norms.

NEW DELHI: India raised concerns during Friday's International Monetary Fund's Executive Board meeting regarding IMF's financial assistance to Pakistan While abstaining from voting, India said, ""Pakistan has been a prolonged borrower from the IMF, with a very poor track record of implementation and of adherence to the IMF's program conditions. ""India further highlighted that the recurring financial support has led Pakistan to amass significant debt obligations, effectively making it a 'too big to fail debtor' for the IMF.Read more: India targets Pakistan on IMF bailout package; abstains from voting over misuse of funds for terrorism Here's why India abstained to vote on Pakistan loan package according to government sources:India abstained from the recent IMF vote on approving a loan to Pakistan not due to a lack of opposition, but because IMF rules do not permit a formal “no” vote.By abstaining, India conveyed its strong dissent within the constraints of the IMF’s voting system and used the opportunity to formally record its objections. India’s key objections included:","The IMF executive board consists of 25 directors who represent member countries or groups of countries.

Apple plans to add AI Search in Safari browser; Senior VP Eddy Cue points to 3 Google rivals,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-plans-to-add-ai-search-in-safari-browser-senior-vp-eddy-cue-points-to-3-google-rivals/articleshow/120993178.cms,"Apple in discussions with OpenAI, Perplexity and others

Apple is planning to add AI-powered search options in the Safari browser . According to a Bloomberg report, Apple’s senior vice president of services, Eddy Cue said during his testimony with the US Justice Department that the company is “actively looking at” reshaping Safari. During the testimony, he revealed that searches on Safari dipped for the first time last month.“That has never happened in 22 years,” he said, adding this is due to people using AI. Cue said he believes that AI tools like OpenAI , Perplexity AI and Anthropic’s Claude AI, will eventually replace search engines like Google Chrome, further adding that Apple will bring these options to Safari in the future.“We will add them to the list — they probably won’t be the default,” he said.Currently, Google is the default search engine on Apple’s Safari browser for which the company pays around $20 billion a year to keep. Analysts estimate this accounts for about 36% of the search advertising revenue Google earns through Safari.Cue said that Apple is in discussions with AI search providers like OpenAI, Perplexity and Anthropic to add their AI tools as an option to Safari.“Prior to AI, my feeling around this was, none of the others were valid choices,” he said. “I think today there is much greater potential because there are new entrants attacking the problem in a different way.”Apple currently integrates OpenAI’s ChatGPT into its Siri digital assistant and plans to add Google’s AI tool Gemini later this year. Cue said the company also considered other AI options, including Anthropic, Perplexity, China-based DeepSeek, and Grok from Elon Musk’s xAI.He added that the deal with OpenAI gives Apple the flexibility to bring in other AI providers to its operating system, including Apple’s own AI models.Google-parent company Alphabet’s shares dipped about 8% on Wednesday (May 7), wiping out $160 billion from the company’s market capitalisation following Eddy Cue’s testimony.","Apple is planning to add AI-powered search options in the Safari browser.

Nvidia targets $50 billion in China's AI boom – why it can't afford to miss out

Impact of US export restrictions on Nvidia

Broader economic implications for the US

China’s rapid AI advancements and competitive threats

Financial performance and market outlook

The path forward: Balancing growth and national security

“The world is right now hungry, anxious to engage AI,”

“Let us get the American AI out in front of everybody right now.”

Nvidia , the world’s leading producer of graphics processing units (GPUs) and a dominant force in the artificial intelligence (AI) industry, is facing a critical challenge as US-China trade tensions continue to escalate. CEO Jensen Huang recently emphasized the significance of the Chinese AI market , which he estimates could reach $50 billion in the next two to three years.Speaking at ServiceNow’s Knowledge 2025 conference in Las Vegas, Huang described the potential loss of access to this market as ahighlighting the broader economic impact on US jobs, revenue, and technological leadership. This concern comes amid tighter US export restrictions that have significantly affected Nvidia’s business prospects in China, one of its largest international markets.China has long been a vital market for Nvidia, not only as a major consumer of its advanced AI chips but also as a hub for cutting-edge AI research and development. Nvidia’s GPUs, known for their unmatched parallel processing capabilities, are essential for training and deploying sophisticated AI models, making them indispensable for industries ranging from autonomous vehicles to cloud computing.Huang noted in his interview that China’s AI market could grow to $50 billion within the next two to three years, presenting a massive revenue opportunity. Given that Nvidia’s GPUs have become the backbone of the global AI industry, securing a share of this rapidly expanding market is critical for the company’s long-term growth.However, Nvidia’s ability to access this lucrative market has been increasingly constrained by US export controls aimed at limiting China’s technological advancements. Last month, the Trump administration further tightened these restrictions, requiring special licenses for Nvidia to ship its H20 chips to China. These chips, part of the Hopper architecture, were specifically designed to comply with earlier export regulations but are now caught in the latest wave of trade restrictions.As a result, Nvidia announced a staggering $5.5 billion quarterly charge, reflecting the financial blow of losing a critical revenue stream. This move marks one of the most significant financial impacts on the company since it became a trillion-dollar tech giant, raising concerns about the sustainability of its rapid growth.Huang highlighted the broader economic consequences of these export restrictions, emphasizing the potential loss of US jobs and tax revenue. During the interview, he argued that maintaining access to the Chinese market is not just about Nvidia’s bottom line but also about the long-term competitiveness of the US tech sector.“We just have to stay agile,” Huang said, stressing the importance of balancing national security concerns with the need for economic growth and technological leadership. He added that the ongoing restrictions could force Chinese companies to develop domestic alternatives, potentially reducing US influence in the global AI industry over the long term.Huang’s comments come amid growing concerns about China’s rapid progress in AI technology. At a separate tech conference in Washington, D.C., in April, Huang warned that China is “not behind” in AI and described Huawei as “one of the most formidable technology companies in the world.”This assessment aligns with recent reports indicating that Chinese firms like Huawei and DeepSeek have made significant strides in developing their own AI chips, potentially challenging Nvidia’s dominance in this critical sector. Huang’s remarks underscore the competitive pressure Nvidia faces as it navigates a complex geopolitical landscape.Despite these challenges, Nvidia remains a dominant force in the global AI market. The company’s market capitalization has approached $3 trillion, making it one of the most valuable tech companies in the world. However, its stock has experienced significant volatility in recent months, with shares down about 15% so far this year after nearly tripling in 2023.Nvidia is set to report its next quarterly earnings on May 28, with analysts expecting a 65% year-over-year revenue increase to $43.1 billion, according to data from LSEG. This projected growth reflects the ongoing demand for AI hardware, even as the company grapples with geopolitical uncertainties and supply chain challenges.Huang’s recent comments highlight the delicate balance Nvidia must strike as it seeks to maintain its leadership in the AI industry while navigating complex geopolitical challenges. As US policymakers weigh the risks and benefits of restricting high-tech exports to China, companies like Nvidia face tough decisions about how to adapt to an increasingly fragmented global market.Huang said during his Las Vegas appearance.With AI becoming a critical driver of economic growth and technological innovation, the stakes for Nvidia and the broader US tech sector have never been higher.","N Nvidia is the world’s leading producer of graphics processing units (GPUs) and a dominant force in the artificial intelligence (AI) industry.

Mumbai: From Friday, commuters will have to pay double, or even treble, for BEST bus rides. The minimum bus fare will increase to Rs 10 from Rs 5 for non-AC buses, and to Rs 12 from Rs 6 for AC buses for 5km distance. Significantly, the hike for 50km travel will be as high as 200% for non-AC buses and 160% for AC buses.The last fare revision was in June 2019, when minimum fares dropped to Rs 5 from Rs 8 for non-AC bus travel.""Among the new introductions are more fare stages beyond 20km and up to 50km. The BEST has also reintroduced the concessional 50% fare (half ticket) for children aged between five and 12,"" said BEST spokesperson Sudas Sawant.While daily bus pass fare has increased to Rs 75 from Rs 60, the monthly unlimited bus pass has doubled to Rs 1,800 from Rs 900. With this pass, one can travel on all BEST routes, including those in the extended suburbs of Mumbai Metropolitan Region. Passengers travelling in buses crossing BMC limits will be charged an additional Rs 2 as there are extra taxes being paid for neighbouring cities, an official said.Most daily commuters said that they are not against the fare increase, but pointed out that such hikes and service improvement must go hand in hand.""The number of services has dropped sharply with the fleet dropping to nearly 2,800 buses. There are long waits at bus stops. Overcrowding and poor commuting experience have to be improved,"" they demanded.BEST general manager SVR Srinivas told TOI that the fare hike will bring in Rs 590-crore revenue to the cash-strapped undertaking. ""My priority is to increase the number of buses. We have already begun the process of rationalising routes, and have teamed up with Google to provide predictable journeys with Expected Time of Arrival and trip planning using technology.""He further said that BEST is also rationalising the workforce. ""We will address the issue of conductor shortage by mobilising staff from our internal resources/other departments,"" he added.In the new fare chart, baggage will be charged at the equivalent of an adult fare, subject to a maximum of Rs 30 for non-AC and Rs 35 for AC buses. All fares include a nutrition surcharge of 15 paise.

X has received executive orders from the Indian government requiring X to block over 8,000 accounts in India, subject to potential penalties including significant fines and imprisonment of the company’s local employees. The orders include demands to block access in India to accounts belonging to international news organizations and prominent X users.

Poll Do you think blocking accounts is an effective way to enforce local laws? No, it stifles communication Yes, it can deter illegal activity

In most cases, the Indian government has not specified which posts from an account have violated India's local laws. For a significant number of accounts, we did not receive any evidence or justification to block the accounts.

To comply with the orders, we will withhold the specified accounts in India alone. We have begun that process. However, we disagree with the Indian government’s demands. Blocking entire accounts is not only unnecessary, it amounts to censorship of existing and future content, and is contrary to the fundamental right of free speech.

This is not an easy decision, however keeping the platform accessible in India is vital to Indians’ ability to access information.

We believe that making these executive orders public is essential for transparency – lack of disclosure discourages accountability and can contribute to arbitrary decision making. However, due to legal restrictions, we are unable to publish the executive orders at this time.

X is exploring all possible legal avenues available to the company. Unlike users located in India, X is restricted by Indian law in its ability to bring legal challenges against these executive orders. However, we encourage all users who are impacted by these blocking orders to seek appropriate relief from the courts.

The negotiations on Saturday and Sunday are intended to de-escalate the situation and help set the stage for a broader trade pact between the two economic superpowers.In a post on social media, Trump said that an 80% tariff on China ""seems right,"" adding that it would be ""up to Scott B,"" an apparent reference to treasury secretary Scott Bessent.An 80% tariff would be a big drop from the current 145% that Trump imposed on Chinese imports in recent months. But that high a level would still shut off most trade between the countries. Chinese data released on Friday showed shipments from that country to the US plunged 21% in April from the same period a year ago.It's also unclear if the talks will lead to any short-term resolution for two govts that have serious economic disputes and have taken a harsh tone toward the other in recent months.The Trump administration has been racing to strike trade deals with other countries ahead of a self-imposed deadline for additional tariffs to go in effect on most trading partners. But it has remained in a standoff with China, which is already subject to a minimum tariff of 145% on all imports.This week, the two sides agreed to hold meetings in Geneva that will include Bessent; Jamieson Greer, the US trade representative; and He Lifeng, China's vice premier for economic policy.Stock markets in the US opened higher on Friday after Trump expressed a willingness to lower tariffs and said in a separate post that many trade deals were ""in the hopper."" On Thursday, Trump highlighted a new preliminary economic pact with Britain as evidence that his tariff strategy is working.Despite signs of greater flexibility from Trump, an 80% tariff may not be low enough to restart business across the Pacific. While it differs from company to company, some executives have said that tariffs above 50% are generally enough to freeze exports to the US. Companies that are not able to find an alternative source of supply for their products outside China are facing the prospect of bankruptcy and layoffs as the summer grinds on and even 25% tariffs can be crippling. nyt",Donald Trump suggests he is open to sharply reducing the tariffs that the U.S. has imposed on China.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Delhi Results 2025: 'LinkedIn Lessons' from Brand BJP's win and Brand AAP's loss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-results-2025-linkedin-lessons-from-brand-bjps-win-and-brand-aaps-loss/articleshow/118066797.cms,"AAP: From Disruptor to Establishment to Decline



AAP was the ultimate political startup—the kind that raises Series A, B, and C funding at record speed, becomes a unicorn, and then implodes under its own weight. It was supposed to be the alternative to traditional politics, the fresh face in a crowded market, a party that rejected caste, religion, and dynasty-driven politics.

But somewhere along the way, it stopped being a startup and started behaving like an old-school corporate giant—bloated, bureaucratic, and overconfident.

1) From Lean & Agile to Bureaucratic & Slow

AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach—the political equivalent of a D2C brand shaking up a legacy market.

Over time, it became centralized and top-heavy, with decision-making confined to a handful of leaders. MLAs became inaccessible, the leadership became distant, and ground-level mobilization weakened. No succession planning. Kejriwal remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force.

remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force. The result? Voters saw it as just another party, not the disruptor it once was.

2) A Reputation Built on Ethics, Lost to Scandals

AAP built its brand on fighting corruption—but its own leadership got embroiled in one of the biggest scandals of its time, the liquor policy scam.

Manish Sisodia, Sanjay Singh, and even Kejriwal himself faced corruption allegations, undoing years of anti-corruption positioning.

The Sheesh Mahal controversy—where Kejriwal’s residence was allegedly renovated with ₹45 crore of taxpayer money—completely shattered the “humble leader” narrative.

AAP’s response? Defensive, aggressive, and dismissive. Instead of damage control, it doubled down on denial—a classic PR blunder.

The perception shift was swift and brutal—from “anti-corruption warriors” to just another power-hungry political entity.

3) Ignoring the Middle-Class Voter That Built Its Base

AAP was originally the party of the middle class—frustrated taxpayers who wanted clean governance and economic relief.

Over time, its focus shifted to freebies and populist policies, leaving the middle class feeling ignored.

BJP stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters.

stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters. Kejriwal’s pre-election outreach to the middle class felt forced and last-minute—while BJP had already solidified its positioning.

Takeaway ? A business (or party) that forgets its core customer will eventually lose them.

4) Blaming External Factors Instead of Owning Failures

For 10 years, AAP blamed the Centre, the LG, and opposition parties for everything.

The “victim card” was effective in the early years but wore thin by 2025—voters expected governance, not excuses.

BJP flipped this weakness into an advantage, promising that with a BJP-led government, there would be no Centre-state conflicts, leading to “seamless governance.”

The narrative changed from “AAP vs. BJP” to “AAP vs. Results.” Lesson? Leaders who constantly shift blame instead of delivering solutions lose credibility.

5) Strategic Missteps and Lack of Political Alliances

AAP contested separately from Congress, which led to a split in the anti-BJP vote.

Rahul Gandhi’s direct attacks on Kejriwal made matters worse—AAP was getting hit from both sides.

Internal conflicts weakened the party further. Atishi and Saurabh Bharadwaj were seen as Kejriwal’s successors, but there was no clear transition strategy.

BJP: A Masterclass in Strategic Adaptation

BJP’s 2025 win in Delhi was not a Modi-centric sweep but a well-calibrated organizational comeback. After a lackluster 2024 Lok Sabha performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader.

performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader. Unlike AAP, BJP adapted, restructured, and executed flawlessly.

1) Moving Beyond Modi Dependency

BJP understood that Delhi’s electorate needed a more localized approach.

Instead of making the election about Modi, it focused on governance, urban issues, and direct voter engagement.

No CM face? It didn’t matter. The party projected collective leadership instead of relying on one individual.

By decentralizing its campaign, BJP looked more stable and future-ready.

2) Adopting AAP’s Own Strategies Against It

BJP neutralized AAP’s welfare advantage—promising free electricity, continued subsidies, and additional financial support for women.

Middle-class tax reliefs were announced just before the elections, ensuring they won over voters that AAP had neglected.

The manifesto focused on real urban issues—pollution control, traffic congestion, and infrastructure—exactly what AAP had failed to address convincingly.

Lesson? The best way to beat a competitor is to adopt their strengths while exposing their weaknesses.

3) Letting Congress Do The Attacking



BJP didn’t need to attack AAP aggressively—Rahul Gandhi and Congress did that for them.

By letting AAP and Congress fight it out, BJP consolidated its voter base while the opposition split.

AAP’s credibility suffered more because the attacks came from within the anti-BJP camp.

A strategic win, without unnecessary effort.

4) A Disciplined, Focused, and Well-Executed Campaign

BJP stayed on message, focusing on corruption, governance, and economic stability.

The campaign was structured and well-planned, unlike AAP’s which seemed reactive and disorganized.

The promise to investigate AAP’s corruption cases resonated with voters, reinforcing BJP’s stance on accountability.

In business terms? BJP had a clear marketing strategy, strong brand positioning, and flawless execution.

5) Final Takeaways

Adaptability is key. BJP recalibrated after its 2024 Lok Sabha setbacks, while AAP remained stagnant.

Brand trust is fragile. AAP built its image on honesty but lost credibility due to scandals and mismanagement.

Execution matters more than rhetoric. BJP delivered a disciplined, well-structured campaign.

Leadership succession planning is critical. AAP failed to build second-line leadership, while BJP showcased organizational depth.

Voters reward governance, not excuses. After a decade in power, AAP’s blame game no longer worked.

Politics, like business, rewards those who adapt, execute, and deliver.

Ah, another election, another flood of LinkedIn wisdom posts—where every poll result is a ""case study,"" every political leader is a ""CEO,"" and every campaign is an ""MBA-level lesson in leadership."" Some call it democracy, but on LinkedIn, it’s all about business jargon and corporate analogies.So, let’s break this down the LinkedIn way.BJP, on the other hand, had a structured, disciplined campaign with clear messaging and no internal rifts. In politics and business, a divided team rarely wins.","AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach.

I congratulate the BJP for this victory and I hope they will fulfil all the promises for which people have voted for them,"" Kejriwal said in a video address posted on X.In the evening as the results were decalred, PM Modi kicked off his victory speech with a powerful chant of ""Yamuna Maiya ki Jai"". PM Modi declared that the people of Delhi were experiencing both relief and joy -- relief from the ""disaster"" (AAP-da governance) and joy in embracing a new era under BJP rule. ""I had written a letter to every Delhi resident, urging them to give the BJP a chance to serve in the 21st century...Today, I bow my head in gratitude to every family in Delhi for trusting us. You have given us love with an open heart, and I assure you that we will return it manifold through rapid development,"" PM Modi said.The Prime Minister also attacked the AAP over allegations of corruption against its leaders, saying that all links of such charges will be probed and those who ""looted"" money will have to return it.With the BJP set to regain control of Delhi after 27 years, what went wrong for the Aam Aadmi Party?After governing Delhi for a decade, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) faced significant anti-incumbency.While AAP achieved impressive results in health and education during its first two terms, and kept voters happy with power and water subsidies, unfulfilled promises, such as improved air quality, became major poll issues.The AAP's assertion that the BJP government at the Centre was creating roadblocks in its functioning began to be increasingly seen by voters as excuses, especially after ten years in power.The BJP's ""double engine"" promise, suggesting seamless governance between the central and state levels, appealed to voters against the backdrop of AAP's constant conflicts with the Centre. Furthermore, internal disarray within the AAP, with senior leaders facing jail time, added to the challenges of incumbency .The image of Arvind Kejriwal as an anti-corruption crusader suffered a setback due to several factors, most notably the controversy surrounding the now-scrapped liquor policy.The BJP accused the AAP government of turning Delhi into a ""city of drunkards"" with the new policy, and receiving crores in kickbacks from those who opened the vends.Probes by central agencies led to the arrest of top AAP leaders, including Arvind Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia, and Sanjay Singh. These arrests forced Sisodia to step down as deputy chief minister and kept the AAP in ""firefighting mode"", distracting from fulfilling its 2020 poll promises.Additionally, the ""Sheesh Mahal"" controversy, referring to the renovated residence of the chief minister, further dented Kejriwal's image. The BJP further highlighted a Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) report that indicated the renovation cost had increased from an initial estimate of Rs 7.91 crore to Rs 33.66 crore by completion.AAP has been synonymous with Arvind Kejriwal since its inception. Kejriwal, initially seen as an agent of change with his untucked shirt and no-nonsense demeanor, resonated with the common person.However, the anti-corruption image of Kejriwal and his party suffered irreparable damage, specially after the AAP leader's arrest in March 2024 on corruption allegations and his subsequent resignation as CM.While he was later granted bail, the leadership transition to Atishi and the circumstances surrounding Kejriwal's arrest damaged the party's image and cohesion.The absence of an alliance with the Congress party and the Congress's strategic campaigning likely contributed to the AAP's loss.In previous elections, the AAP had significantly reduced the Congress's presence in the Delhi assembly.Attempts to convince Congress workers to collaborate with AAP volunteers reportedly led to an ""existential crisis"" among them.The Congress decided to campaign aggressively against the AAP, sensing ""anger building up against the AAP"". Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra attacked the AAP in the final days of the Delhi campaign.The Congress further claimed the AAP did not want an alliance, with Kejriwal announcing all 70 candidates early on.The rise of AAP in Delhi has been congruous with the decline of the Congress. In 2013, AAP won 28 seats with a 29.49% vote share, while the Congress tally decreased to 8 seats from 43 in 2008. In 2015, Congress suffered a 15% decline in its vote share, while the AAP saw its support base rise by around 15%.While AAP's welfare schemes, such as free electricity and bus travel for women, initially garnered support, a lack of focus on infrastructure development and maintenance became a significant issue.The poor condition of roads and sewers across Delhi angered voters.Overflowing drains, potholed roads, and irregular garbage collection contributed to the party's unpopularity.The AAP's control over the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) meant it could not deflect blame for these issues onto the BJP. Voters in middle- and upper-middle-class areas were particularly affected by the deteriorating infrastructure.AAP's origins trace back to Anna Hazare’s anti-corruption movement, positioning the party as an alternative to the Congress in 2013.While AAP secured mandates in 2015 and 2020, their repeated promises and ""freebies"" seem to have lost their appeal.The promise of piped water connections for all in 2015 remains unfulfilled, as does the promise of full statehood for Delhi and the ""Rozgar Budget"" aimed at creating 20 lakh jobs.Kejriwal himself admitted that he had failed to fulfill three promises: cleaning the Yamuna, providing clean drinking water, and upgrading Delhi's roads. This acknowledgment gave the BJP an opportunity to attack the AAP, with Amit Shah mocking Kejriwal's promise to purify the Yamuna.The BJP's campaign strategy focused primarily on targeting Arvind Kejriwal and his government, rather than emphasising Hindutva, as it has often done during campainging in other state elections as well as previous Delhi polls.This approach likely resonated with a broader segment of the population, including those who may not have been inclined to support a religiously charged campaign. By focusing on issues such as corruption and governance, the BJP effectively undermined AAP's credibility and appealed to a wider range of voters.The BJP also focused on hyper-local issues such as air pollution, traffic, and public safety, and engaged with local Resident Welfare Associations. They also promoted central government schemes.The BJP also targeted specific demographics, including Purvanchalis and slum dwellers, and utilised an aggressive digital campaign with AI-enhanced content and memes targeting AAP.The BJP's consistent performance in the Lok Sabha polls in Delhi indicated a latent voter base that the party successfully mobilised this time around for the assembly elections.Despite AAP's strong performance in the assembly elections, the BJP had consistently swept Lok Sabha elections in the national capital, winning all seven seats.This pre-existing support base provided a foundation for the BJP's campaign and likely contributed to their victory.The BJP also strategically fielded Parvesh Verma, a strong Jat leader, in the New Delhi constituency, signaling their intention to win back the confidence of the Jat community, which had previously favoured AAP in Delhi elections.During the Delhi Assembly elections, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi launched strong criticisms against Arvind Kejriwal, which may have been payback for events in Haryana. Gandhi's attacks covered a range of issues, including alleged corruption, unfulfilled promises, and inaction on key issues.Like the BJP, Gandhi attacked Kejriwal over the alleged liquor scam and accused him of living in a ""Sheesh Mahal"" while engaging in corrupt practices.Gandhi said that Kejriwal made false promises, ""similar to Prime Minister Narendra Modi"", particularly regarding cleaning the Yamuna River. He also challenged Kejriwal to drink Delhi's tap water, implying it was still polluted despite promises to clean it.The Aam Aadmi Party's (AAP) win in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) in 2022 proved to be a double-edged sword, ultimately hurting the party instead of helping it. AAP had promised a cleaner city with world-class roads, but it fell short on both accounts. The MCD House was in limbo, and the Standing Committee, which controls all financial powers, was never formed. The AAP repeatedly accused the Centre of creating hurdles through the Lieutenant Governor and stalling projects.This time around, voters held the AAP accountable for the deteriorating civic infrastructure across Delhi.AAP's performance in the MCD was a letdown for the people of Delhi. The party failed to address critical issues such as clearing garbage, repairing roads, and cleaning clogged sewers. Erratic water supply and overflowing sewers that were never repaired because Rs 4,000 crore for the Delhi Jal Board was not released further hurt the party.Senior party leaders stated that the MCD functioning had collapsed under the AAP, and no work was being done, leading to frustration among councillors.The steady departure of senior leaders from AAP over time might have also weakened the party's organisational structure and public image.The exit of prominent figures like Prashant Bhushan, Yogendra Yadav, Mayank Gandhi, and Kumar Vishwas, who had dared to disagree with Arvind Kejriwal, and repeatedly accused Kejriwal of having an ""autocratic"" style of leadership.Resignation of senior leaders like Kailash Gahlot, who cited the party's focus on political agenda over fulfilling promises, along with internal challenges, signalled internal discord.The BJP had termed Gahlot's resignation a ""courageous move"".Negative campaigning by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) centered on issues like Yamuna River pollution, the Delhi Police, and the Election Commission (EC) may have affected public perception of the AAP government.In the lead up to the polls, Kejriwal accused the BJP-led Haryana government of poisoning the Yamuna River, which supplies drinking water to Delhi. He claimed that the Haryana government deliberately sent polluted waters to Delhi to create an artificial water scarcity and blame the AAP.The AAP also repeatedly levelled accusations of voter fraud and irregularities against the BJP as well as the EC.AAP alleged that the Election Commission and Delhi Police were shielding BJP workers and accused them of ""hooliganism"". Kejriwal wrote to the Chief Election Commissioner, expressing concern over the intimidation and harassment of AAP volunteers by BJP workers. The EC responded that no written complaints could be traced in most cases but assured that all registered complaints are investigated.Kejriwal further criticised the Election Commission for allegedly refusing to make Form 17C public, a document detailing the number of votes polled at each booth. AAP then launched a website, transparentelections.in, claiming to upload Form 17C data for all constituencies to present the data in an accessible format.The EC dismissed Kejriwal's claims regarding Form 17C, stating that copies had already been provided to polling agents at each booth after voting, as per Rule 49S of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961.","BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal.

The Trump administration is considering cutting the steep 145% tariff on Chinese imports by more than half, possibly as early as next week, as US and Chinese officials gear up for high-level trade talks in Switzerland,reported, citing sources close to the negotiations.US officials are reportedly weighing a reduction of the levy to somewhere between 50% and 54%, a move aimed at easing tensions as trade negotiations unfold. The proposed cut, according to, would be accompanied by a separate plan to lower tariffs on imports from neighbouring South Asian countries to 25%.“They are going to be bringing it down to 50% while the negotiations are ongoing,” a source was quoted as saying byUS President Trump hinted at the potential tariff shift during a meeting with UK officials in the Oval Office, stating, “It’s at 145 so we know it’s coming down,” while expressing optimism over US-China ties. “I think we’re going to have a very good relationship,” he added. Retail industry leaders , including Walmart’s Doug McMillon, Target’s Brian Cornell, and Home Depot’s Ted Decker, reportedly urged Trump to consider easing the tariff burden during an April 21 meeting at the White House.Though the executives described the session as “productive” and “constructive,” no specific outcomes were disclosed.Retailers have since started preparing for a range of tariff outcomes. Jay Foreman, CEO of toy company Basic Fun, was quoted bythat many are now asking vendors to quote prices based on tariffs between 10% and 54% to ensure flexibility.He added that a 54% levy would still push prices up significantly, such as a Tonka truck jumping from $29.99 to $49.99 but that’s “workable.” A 145% tariff, however, would push the price to nearly $80, which he warned would “bring sales to a virtual standstill.”Nick Mowbray, CEO of toy brand Zuru, said “the speculation is 54%,” but noted that it has “definitely not been told explicitly to retail yet.”Meanwhile, White House dismissed the tariff rollback talk as speculation, reported the news agency. “When decisions on tariffs are made, they will come directly from the President. Anything else is just pure speculation,” said a White House spokesperson.Still, retail executives say treasury secretary Scott Bessent’s recent remarks at the Milken Institute Global Conference, that the current rate “isn’t sustainable”, gave them confidence that a shift is imminent.Lawrence Rosen, chairman of Cra-Z-Art, confirmed tothat retailers are hearing similar figures, “We are hearing China at 50% to 54% and other Asian countries at 25%.”Foreman revealed that Basic Fun has seven containers en route to the US under the 145% rate and plans to store them to avoid the costly levy. The rest remain in warehouses, awaiting green light.Noel Hacegaba, COO at the Port of Long Beach, said hopes are high the Switzerland talks will help “de-escalate growing trade tensions,” but stressed that shippers need “a strong signal” before adjusting supply routes.Retail expert Gerald Storch, former CEO of Toys R Us, toldthat since the White House meeting, retailers seem “less panicked” and have slightly “relaxed” their urgency for domestic sourcing.While the situation remains fluid, the toy industry, with 80% of US toy sales coming from China and broader retail sector are closely watching for any official word from Trump in the coming days.","The Trump administration is considering cutting the steep 145% tariff on Chinese imports by more than half, possibly as early as next week.

Air traffic controllers for Newark airport briefly lose radar access again,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/air-traffic-controllers-for-newark-airport-briefly-lose-radar-access-again/articleshow/121047277.cms,"A control tower is seen at Newark Liberty International Airport in Newark, NJ (AP photo)





The air traffic controllers directing planes into the Newark, New Jersey, airport briefly lost their radar Friday morning for the second time in two weeks, renewing concerns about the nation's aging air traffic control system that President Donald Trump wants to overhaul.The Federal Aviation Administration said the radar at the facility in Philadelphia that directs planes in and out of Newark airport went black for 90 seconds at 3:55 a.m. Friday. That's similar to what happened on April 28.That first radar outage led to hundreds of flights being canceled or delayed at the Newark airport in the past two weeks after the FAA slowed down traffic at the airport to ensure safety. Five controllers also went on trauma leave after that outage, worsening the existing shortage.It's not clear if any additional controllers will go on leave now.The number of cancellations and delays spiked after the FAA limited traffic at Newark and has remained high since then. The FAA said Newark is one of the most delay-prone airports in the nation right now. In addition to all the technical and staffing challenges, an ongoing runway construction project is adding to the disruptions.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a briefing Friday that the ""glitch this morning at Newark"" was caused by the same issues as last week.The latest Newark problems reinforce the need for the multibillion-dollar plan Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced Thursday to replace the nation's aging air traffic control system, Leavitt said. The plan is designed to prevent such problems from happening and give controllers modern technology. More than 4,600 new high-speed connections would be installed and 618 radars would be replaced across the country.Officials developed the plan to upgrade the system after a deadly midair collision in January between a passenger jet and an Army helicopter killed 67 people in the skies over Washington, D.C. Several other crashes this year also put pressure on officials to act.But the shortcomings of the air traffic control system have been known for decades. The National Transportation Safety Board has not determined that a problem with the air traffic control system caused the crash near Reagan National Airport.There has been an average of 34 arrival cancellations per day since mid April at Newark, and the FAA said the number of delays increases throughout the day from an average of five in the mornings to 16 by the evening. They tend to last 85 to 137 minutes on average.The FAA said the airport clearly cannot handle its current traffic, so it will propose cutting arrivals and departures to 28 each per hour until the runway construction is complete, and 34 per hour after the main runway project is completed, although some work will continue on the weekends.The FAA scheduled a formal meeting with all the airlines that fly out of Newark on Wednesday and Thursday of next week to talk about cutting their schedules while the staffing and technology issues persist.These radar outages in such a crowded airspace are alarming because seconds matter, but Allied Pilots Association spokesman Capt. Dennis Tajer said ""it's not an impending disaster that some are suggesting.""""The system is wired to run really well when everything's functioning. But the most important part is that it's prepared to function when things go wrong,"" Tajer said. ""Even when it sounds frightening, know that the air traffic controllers and the pilots have training and we go to that.""When pilots lose contact with controllers their first action is to continue on their last-directed path, but if the outage continues, pilots will start broadcasting their position to every other plane in the area - much like pilots do at small airports that don't have a control tower.U.S. Rep. Josh Gottheimer blamed the problems that have plagued Newark on the lack of proper air traffic controller staffing and modern technology.""Our region is a key economic artery for our country. Yet this region ... one of the busiest air spaces in the world, as I mentioned, is running off a tower that's full of copper wire dating back to the 1980s with outdated and inefficient technology,"" Gottheimer said. He said the tower was built back in ""the Brady Bunch era"" in 1973.The FAA said it currently has 24 air traffic controllers assigned to handle the Newark traffic, but it wants to have 38. And now several of those are on leave. Plus, 16 of the controllers currently working in Philadelphia are only assigned there temporarily through July 2026 as part of the facility's move from New York that it made last summer. So the FAA is working to quickly certify as many of the 26 trainees currently working in Philadelphia as possible.The FAA said earlier this week that it is installing new fiber optic data lines to carry the radar signal between its facilities in Philadelphia and New York. Officials said some of the lines connecting those two facilities are outdated copper wire that will be replaced. But it's not clear how quickly those repairs can be completed.U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York said it's important that the FAA get the problems affecting the Newark airport fixed quickly.""Enough is enough. The connection between New York air space and the Philadelphia air traffic control center must be fixed now. The backup system that is not working must be fixed. Now,"" Schumer said. ""This is an air travel safety emergency that requires immediate and decisive action, not a promise of a big, beautiful unfunded overhaul that will take years to begin to implement.""",The radar at the facility in Philadelphia that directs planes in and out of Newark airport went black for 90 seconds at 3:55 a.m. Friday.

NEW DELHI: For the Indian security establishment , the precision strikes on the nine terror camps were meant to be a stark message to LeT, JeM and Hizbul Mujahideen terrorists: ""We know you were behind the cowardly attacks, we know where you are and we can get you despite the protection you have from Pakistan army and ISI"".The missiles and niche loitering munitions used by the Army and IAF, besides claiming a toll of over 100, may have also eroded the terrorists' confidence in the security umbrella of Pakistan army and it tried to repair the damage by turning out in fatigues for the funeral of those killed, the source said.""As a possible corollary, they could leverage the frustration and insecurity of terrorists to incite them to launch attacks in India,"" the source said.As per the estimate of the security establishment here, the risk of terrorists trying to set off fresh attacks has risen also because of India's success in neutralising the efforts to breach its air defence and target its military facilities over the past 48 hours. ""They may fall back on the default option of using terror proxies to compensate for the failure of their forces,"" a senior govt functionary involved in decision-making said.""Tragic aberrations like the April 22 mass killing in Pahalgam notwithstanding, India has been very successful in thwarting terror attacks over the past 10 years. But now we have to brace for a higher level of desperation,"" he said.","The missiles and niche loitering munitions used by the Army and IAF, besides claiming a toll of over 100, may have also eroded the terrorists' confidence.
