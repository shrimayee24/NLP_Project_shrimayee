He mentioned that Dallewal was too weak to speak much due to his prolonged fasting, and the purpose of the meeting was to show solidarity rather than have an extended discussion.Wangchuk urged people to support the farmers, saying, ""The food we eat is produced by the farmers.""Dallewal's hunger strike has continued for 33 days.Meanwhile, Supreme Court on Saturday gave the Punjab government time until December 31 to convince farmer leader Jagjit Singh Dallewal, who has been on a hunger strike for over a month, to move to a hospital.Farmers are protesting to demand a legal guarantee for the minimum support price (MSP) and other issues.

Don't act as spokesperson of farm protesters: Supreme Court to Punjab,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dont-act-as-spokesperson-of-farm-protesters-supreme-court-to-punjab/articleshow/116753250.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Saturday warned of constitutional consequences as Punjab govt expressed ""helplessness"" in hospitalising a ""protester besieged"" fast-on-to-death farmer representative Jagjit Singh Dallewal at Shambhu border and feared that using force to implement SC orders could lead to ""collateral damages"".Advocate general of Punjab Gurminder Singh told a bench of Justices Surya Kant and Sudhanshu Dhulia that the farmer representative is surrounded by thousands of protesters who have welded tractors together to form a fortress to prevent authorities from either shifting Dallewal, who is also reluctant, to a hospital or reaching him medical aid.The bench asked, ""Who has allowed such a situation to develop at the border? Who is responsible for controlling law and order? How can a gathering of farmers prevent a reputed farmer representative , whose health is deteriorating, from getting hospitalised? Dallewal could continue his fast in hospital under medical supervision and this court has assured that it will help solve the issues raised by the farmers.""Punjab AG said, ""The situation arose as the farmers were stopped from marching to Delhi at the Shambhu border. Centre could now intervene and assure them about change in MSP law which alone can defuse the situation. Using the force would surely result in collateral damage. To save one life, we cannot lose more lives. We are helpless.""This statement of Bhagwant Singh Mann-led AAP govt drew sharp rebuke from the bench, which said, ""Do you (AG) want SC to record that state govt is helpless in dealing with a law and order situation? Do you understand the constitutional consequences of a state's helplessness? Do not put words in our mouth and say implementation of the court's order would require use of force and result in casualties. Your officers know what is to be done.""Warning the AAP govt not to act as the spokesperson of protesters, the bench said, ""Dallewal appears to be under peer pressure. Those protesters who do not want him to be hospitalised, lack bona fide. Have you ever seen a group of protesters who want their representative to die? Govt is unfortunately speaking the language of the protesters. We are not accepting any pre-condition (of change of law in MSP). We have constituted a high-level committee which would examine the issues and make recommendations. We would then do our best to resolve the issue."" The court asked whether Punjab govt needed logistical assistance from Centre to deal with the situation.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta said ""Centre's intervention could allow the situation to deteriorate further. Delay in hospitalising Dallewal would allow more and more farmers to gather at the protest site and situation would worsen,"" he said, adding Punjab govt should act swiftly and maturely.The apex court bench agreed with SG and told Punjab chief secretary and DGP that it does not want their lengthy affidavits explaining the difficulties they faced in defusing the situation. ""We want a one line affidavit reporting compliance of the court's Dec 20 order (for hospitalisation of Dallewal). We will give time till Dec 31,"" it said.","Punjab govt expressed ""helplessness"" in hospitalising a ""protester besieged"" fast-on-to-death farmer representative Jagjit Singh Dallewal at Shambhu border.

Toxic remains of 1984 tragedy set to roll out of Bhopal today,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/toxic-remains-of-1984-tragedy-set-to-roll-out-of-bhopal-today/articleshow/116751080.cms,"INDORE: Sometime on Saturday night or early Sunday morning, trucks may begin rolling out of Bhopal carrying the remnants of tragic history.Around 337 tonnes of toxic waste left over from 1984 gas tragedy will be taken 225km away to Pithampur to be turned into smoke and ashes. Bhopal gas tragedy relief and rehabilitation department director Swantantra Kumar Singh has already written to senior officials in Indore, Bhopal and Dhar to prepare for it. A dozen GPS-enabled trucks are ready to move the waste.On Dec 3, Madhya Pradesh HC set a deadline of four weeks to shift the hazardous waste, stored so far at the abandoned Union Carbide factory in Bhopal, to Pithampur waste disposal facility. ""Are you waiting for another tragedy?"" HC asked authorities, rapping them for the long delay.The Union Carbide waste will be disposed of in two stages - incineration and landfill. Once the trucks reach Pithampur Industrial Waste Management Pvt Ltd facility near Tarpura village, trial incineration of 35.6 MT waste will be carried out to understand how long it takes for the waste to be burnt safely, a source told TOI. Three feed rates - 135kg/hr, 80kg/hr and 270kg/hr - will be tried out. The rest of the toxic waste will be incinerated after establishing the optimum feed rate for incineration.Sources told TOI that a 'red corridor' may be created for safe transport of waste.""We can shift the waste any time, once the packing is complete and security assessment is made. It depends, most probably at night,"" Swantantra Kumar Singh told TOI. Sources told TOI that the trucks were likely to begin moving around 4.30am on Sunday.In 2015, 10MT waste was moved to Pithampur facility for at least seven trial runs, the last of which cleared environmental parameters. This paved the way for the current disposal plan. ""We will move the entire waste from Union Carbide factory in one go. We are trying to send all the containers in a single row ensuring maximum safety precautions,"" Singh said.The Pithampur facility has been asked to install a separate electric meter arrangement to run pollution control devices. If any of the devices stops functioning, the system will stop electric supply and will not come back on line until the device is restored. The process will be monitored via CCTV from MP pollution control board control room in Bhopal.", 337 tonnes of toxic waste left over from 1984 gas tragedy will be taken 225km away to Pithampur.

MHA clarification







'Govt couldn't allocate even 1,000 yards': Kejriwal

NEW DELHI: A war of words erupted between the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party on Saturday over the cremation of former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh at Delhi's Nigambodh Ghat. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi called the central government's decision to conduct the cremation at Nigambodh Ghat instead of a desginated memorial site a ""grave insult"" to the former PM. Meanwhile, the BJP called Rahul's comments a ""new low in politics of India"".In a post on X, Rahul Gandhi said, “The great son of Mother India and the first Prime Minister of the Sikh community, Dr. Manmohan Singh Ji, has been totally insulted by the present government by performing his last rites at Nigambodh Ghat.”Rahul also wrote about Singh’s legacy, describing him as a leader whose policies elevated India to an economic superpower and provided critical support to the underprivileged.Highlighting what he termed as a deviation from tradition, the Leader of opposition in Lok Sabha said, “Till date, respecting the dignity of all former Prime Ministers, their last rites were performed at authorised burial sites so that every person could have the last darshan and pay homage without any inconvenience. Dr. Manmohan Singh deserves our highest respect and a memorial. The government should have shown respect to this great son of the country and his proud community.”Congress MP from Wayanad Priyanka Gandhi Vadra also backed Rahul, and said that the government should have looked ""beyond politics"" on the matter. She alleged that she saw Dr. Singh's family ""struggling for a place"" at the funeral site.""The government should have thought beyond politics and narrow-mindedness in this matter. This morning, I felt this when I saw Dr. Manmohan Singh ji's family members struggling for a place at the funeral site, trying to find a place in the crowd, and the general public getting troubled due to lack of space and paying tribute from the road outside,"" she said.The BJP swiftly responded to Rahul Gandhi, calling the Congress leader's post ""shameful"" and ""unfortunate."" BJP MP Sambit Patra, speaking at a press conference, reiterated the party's belief in ""dignity in death."" Patra further added that after the passing of the former Prime Minister, the Cabinet had sent a letter to the Congress and Singh's family, expressing the government's intent to build a memorial in his honour.""This is a new low in politics of India, thanks to the Congress party . Due to the Congres party - we are here to have a press conference on the day when the last rites of the former prime minister were done... BJP believes that there has to be dignity in death. The kind of politics Congress is doing, especially Rahul Gandhi - who has tweeted about the cremation is shameful,"" the BJP MP said.""We in a cabinet meeting after the demise of the former PM Manmohan Singh - decided that since he was the PM and had a big stature - the cabinet wrote a letter to Congress and Dr Singh's family - where the cabinet said that we should build a memorial in his name so that the country and the world remember him for his positive works,"" he added.In the letter, Patra said that governemnt had informed the grand old party and Dr Singh's family that there is procedure that needs to be followed while building a memorial but ""cremation is a process that can't wait"".""There is a procedure to build a memorial but cremation is a process that can't wait... It was a direct communication that our party had extended. But, after that, the kind of politics Congress did, it shouldn't have been done on the day of grief,"" he said.Earlier, BJP national spokesperson CR Kesavan had also lashed out at the grand old party alleging that it was ""unsuccessfully trying to politicise the demise of Dr Manmohan Singh"".Rahul Gandhi's attack comes a day after the ministry of home affairs clarified the government's stance on establishing a memorial for the ex-PM at his final resting place and said that Union minister Amit Shah, after the Cabinet meet, told Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge that the government would allocate space for the memorial.The MHA, in a statement, said the cremation and other formalities can proceed because a Trust has to be formed and space has to be allocated for the memorial.""The government received a request to allocate space for a memorial for former Prime Minister Late Dr Manmohan Singh, from the Congress Party president,"" a statement released by MHA read.""Immediately after the Cabinet meeting, Amit Shah communicated to Congress president Shri Kharge and the family of Late Dr Manmohan Singh that the government will allocate space for the memorial. In the meanwhile cremation and other formalities can happen because a trust has to be formed and space has to be allocated to it,"" it added.The government's response came hours after, Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh took a swipe at the BJP-led central government, calling its decision to conduct the last rites of former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh at Nigambodh Ghat ""a deliberate insult"" to India's first Sikh PM.Former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal also expressed shock over the decision to cremate Singh at Nigambodh Ghat, stating, “The BJP government could not provide even 1,000 yards of land for the last rites and burial of Dr. Manmohan Singh, who belonged to the Sikh community and was renowned all over the world.”Singh, who served as Prime Minister for a decade and is remembered for his economic reforms and steady leadership during global financial crises, passed away on Thursday night at AIIMS, Delhi. He was cremated on Saturday with full state honours.","Congress leader Rahul Gandhi called the central government's decision to conduct the cremation at Nigambodh Ghat instead of a desginated memorial site a ""grave insult"" to the former PM.

He further claimed that ""official vehicles"" linked to these personnel were frequently observed near his home, indicating possible monitoring and pressure tactics.The Aam Aadmi Party , which administers both Delhi and Punjab, has not yet commented on this.Earlier on Thursday, Sandeep Dikshit complained to LG VK Saxena accusing AAP of collecting sensitive details in the name of ""non-existent"" programmes like its Mahila Samman scheme. The scheme, promising to provide Rs 2,100 for women in Delhi, is AAP's key plank for the upcoming assembly elections.""Any party can promise anything.

He stated that ""private vehicles,"" often with Punjab Police escorts, were travelling through Haryana and Rajasthan to reach Delhi.The Lieutenant Governor's office has instructed the Delhi police commissioner to implement ""immediate steps"" for vehicle inspection at city borders, particularly those arriving from Punjab.Instructions have been issued to the DGPs of Punjab, Haryana, and Rajasthan to maintain vigilance and track suspicious movements that might suggest unlawful cash transfers or electoral misconduct.Delhi's chief secretary has been tasked with alerting the chief electoral officer to enhance surveillance as the election approaches.Despite being allies in the INDIA bloc, formed to challenge the BJP earlier this year before the general election, AAP and Congress are competing against each other in the upcoming Delhi election.","Delhi Lieutenant Governor orders investigation into Sandeep Dikshit's allegations of surveillance and large sums of cash transfers from Punjab ahead of the upcoming Assembly elections.

Manmohan Singh: The phone call that changed a nation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/manmohan-singhs-demise-the-phone-call-that-changed-a-nation/articleshow/116696430.cms,"Singh helped India say goodbye to

Licence Raj

It was June 1991. Manmohan Singh had just returned to Delhi, after attending a conference in the Netherlands, and had gone to bed. Late that night, Singh's son-in-law, Vijay Tankha, took a phone call. The voice on the other end was that of PC Alexander, a confidante of PV Narasimha Rao . Alexander urged Vijay to wake up his father-in-law.Singh and Alexander met a few hours later, and the official told Singh about Rao's plan to appoint him FM. Singh, then UGC chairman, and who had never been in politics, didn't take Alexander seriously.But Rao was serious. On June 21, Singh was in his UGC office. He was told to go home, get dressed and attend the swearing-in function. ""Everybody was surprised to see me as a member of the new team lined up to take the oath of office. My portfolio was allotted later, but I was told straight away by Narasimha Rao ji that I was going to be finance minister,"" Singh is quoted as saying in 'Strictly Personal, Manmohan & Gursharan', a book by his daughter Daman Singh.That appointment changed the course of India's economy. From an insular, control-heavy, low-growth economy it became what's today the world's fastest growing major economy.Along with Rao, Singh was the architect of 1991 reforms, weathering attacks from inside and outside Congress. The economy was in tatters, forex reserves had dropped to Rs 2,500 crore, barely sufficient to cover 2 weeks of imports, global banks were refusing to offer loans, forex outflows were large, inflation was soaring.But Singh knew the problems beforehand, and also the solutions, which he outlined in his budget speech a month later. The ball was set rolling within days of moving into North Block. He worked closely with then RBI deputy governor C Rangarajan to devalue the rupee and removed export controls in partnership with P Chidambaram, then the commerce minister.July 24, the day Singh presented his first budget, saw the Indian economy saying good riddance to the licence-permit raj. Hours before the budget, the Rao govt tabled the new industrial policy in Parliament, working on a paper that Singh remembered having seen during his brief stint as economic adviser to Chandra Sekhar, who led a fragile coalition in 1990-91.Based on the document prepared by economic adviser Rakesh Mohan, industrial delicensing was undertaken in all but 18 sectors, and foreign direct investment was allowed in 34 industries. Besides, public sector monopoly in several sectors came to an end and disinvestment of govt shareholding in state-run companies was permitted.His budget freed up fund-raising by Indian companies by setting up Sebi and also announced a new committee under RBI governor M Narasimhan to work out the new architecture for the financial sector, which was implemented by the Rao govt and its successors. The budget focused on fiscal consolidation, by cutting down on wasteful spending.Singh had also drawn attention to the precarious price situation in his 1991 budget speech.""The price situation, which is of immediate concern to the vast mass of our people, poses a serious problem as inflation has reached a double digit level. During the fiscal year ending 31st March 1991 the wholesale price index registered an increase of 12.1%, while the consumer price index registered an increase of 13.6%. The major worrisome feature of the inflation in 1990-91 was that it was concentrated in essential commodities,"" Singh had said.Those reforms had put the economy back on track and triggered optimism globally. The ""Bombay Club"", a group of corporate chiefs who wanted protection from foreign competition, was not happy. But they got it wrong.","Manmohan Singh was the architect of 1991 reforms, weathering attacks from inside and outside Congress.

It is condemnable in the extreme that Union Govt has declined the request of Dr Manmohan Singh Ji's family for performing the funeral and last rites of the highly distinguished leader at a place where an appropriate and historic memorial may be built to commemorate his unparalleled services to the nation,"" Badal in a separate post on X.He further continued to state that it is difficult to understand ""why the govt is showing such disrespect to the great leader who was the only member of the Sikh community to rise to become the Prime Minister. As of now, the cremation is slated to be performed at the common cremation ground at Nigambodh ghat. I am unable to believe that the BJP govt’s bias would go to such extremes in utter disregard of the towering global stature which Dr Manmohan Singh ji enjoyed and will always enjoy.""""Dr Sahib showed great sensitivity and compassion in his dealings with Shiromani Akali Dal over Sikh and Punjab issues. I urge PM Narendra Modi ji to intervene personally to change this deplorable decision of the government,"" he added.In a separate post, former union minister-information & broadcasting Manish Tewari stated that, ""If what is appearing in the Public Space is correct that the cremation of Former Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh will be held at Nigambodh Ghat, it is extremely unfortunate.""""If Late Dr Manmohan Singh's family wanted it that way then it is a different matter otherwise he should be cremated where the last rites of other Former Prime Ministers have taken place. This great son of Punjab who was respected across the world for his erudition, knowledge and sagacity needs to be given a final send off befitting his stewardship of India for ten long years. That is the least that must be done to honour his memory,"" he added.Singh passed away at AIIMS in Delhi on Thursday night at the age of 92 following age-related health issues.

Manmohan Singh could be brutally candid if he trusted you,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/manmohan-singh-could-be-brutally-candid-if-he-trusted-you/articleshow/116727855.cms,"To paraphrase one of the greatest scientists (Einstein) speaking about the greatest Indian ( Mahatma Gandhi ), one could justifiably say that later generations would scarcely believe that a person with the character and style of MMS had been so successful in the hurly burly of Indian administration and politics, and would ride its uppermost crests for decades.Since much is already written and spoken about him, let me cover some uncovered incidents and anecdotes. Highly taciturn at the best of times and never gregarious, MMS went into absolute silence when told about the criminal case pending against him in the so-called coal scam , where he was an accused simply because he was, as Prime Minister, also the coal minister for the relevant time.After I assured him that there was no case worth the name against him, there was pin-drop silence till, in a plaintive voice, he said: 'I have tried all my life never to go near illegality. How could my name even appear there? When will my name be cleared because I know I have done nothing remotely wrong."" I had no real answer except to mumble about the vagaries of our legal system which lead agencies and the judicial system to include a name in the accused list even when they know that it is completely vicarious. I know that MMS, being the most honorable man I have encountered in public life , would not be satisfied with the abatement and closure which death brings to a criminal prosecution but would insist on an exoneration.Secondly, he could be brutally and embarrassingly candid in the company of trusted persons. In front of a then sitting cabinet minister and a senior lady civil servant from Punjab in the PMO, he told me directly about one of his deepest regrets qua me, while hinting at forces beyond his control. Decency and confidentiality inhibit me from disclosing the subject of that remark. He repeated that to me at least four times subsequently.Thirdly, he made it a point to remember his friends and well wishers irrespective of the exalted posts he held. Despite bickering and back-biting in some quarters regarding Narasimha Rao , MMS regularly visited him in his last years and went for almost all of Rao's birth and/or death anniversaries till his health permitted. He made considerable efforts to change his programs to condole my father's death in 2007 and to attend the wedding of my two sons, one in 2013 and the other in 2015. Gursharan ji's great interest in and profound knowledge of music meant that while she attended many of my wife's ghazal and Sufi concerts, 'Dr Saheb' also came impromptu for a couple, once as a sitting PM and another after demitting office. He was simplicity personified and had absolutely no airs and pretenses.Fourthly, I have yet to see an Indian politician who kept his family so scrupulously insulated from his public life and, reciprocally, how much his wife and three daughters (one abroad) have shunned public glare, glamour and media attention. I was actually in the same batch of St Stephen's College as his daughter Upinder. She did History (Hons) and I Economics. We knew each other though not well. Not once did anyone from the MMS family try and leverage his exalted status and not once did it even enter my mind to exploit my acquaintance with Upinder. The entire ecosystem in which MMS thought, worked, lived and operated was far, far away from such approaches.As a Trinity, Cambridge alumnus, I would ask him about his drive which made him one of the few non-academics I knew in India with degrees from both of Oxbridge. He would wryly say that having studied under kerosene lamps and streetlights, he understood early on that education was the greatest equalizer.I hope India has the good fortune of getting such an illustrious son again in the near future though I believe that it is going to be very, very difficult.(The writer is an eminent lawyer & Rajya Sabha MP)","MMS went into absolute silence when told about the criminal case pending against him in the so-called coal scam.

But the Kansas City Chiefs tight end said all of the ""scandal"" portrayed in the various storylines was ""terrifying"" to watch, he told listeners on Christmas Eve.“What’s crazy is that all of these stories tie together in one community, and it’s supposed to make it look like this is what happens,” he said. “Like, this is what’s going on around you.” Travis deemed the movie ""far-fetched,"" unable to relate to the characters on screen, and denied it should be considered a Christmas movie.

Swift, in a 2014 Teen Vogue interview, used a quote from Love Actually as her personal motto. At the time, the pop star gushed, “If you look around, love actually is all around.” Love Actually is a 2003 British Christmas romantic comedy film written and directed by Richard Curtis. The Christmas film features an ensemble cast, composed predominantly of British actors, many of whom had worked with Curtis in previous projects.The story of Love Actually begins six weeks before Christmas and is played out in a weekly countdown until the holiday, followed by an epilogue that takes place in the New Year. Universal Pictures Home Entertainment released the film on Blu-ray in November 2009. The film was released on Ultra HD Blu-ray on 21 November 2023 for the film's 20th anniversary, featuring a 4K restoration.Swift will likely have even more time to watch holiday films with her beau this year, as she recently concluded her almost two-year, record-breaking Eras Tour.

"Former PM Manmohan Singh loved ‘global’ Bengaluru, and ‘warm hospitality’ of its people",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/former-pm-manmohan-singh-loved-global-bengaluru-and-warm-hospitality-of-its-people/articleshow/116730727.cms,"BENGALURU: Why do investors from around the globe flock to Bengaluru? This question often sparks lively debates, whether in conference rooms at work or cozy conversations in living rooms. The usual answers revolve around the city’s pleasant weather and abundance of skilled talent. But perhaps the most heartwarming response came 18 years ago from then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who beautifully summed it up: “It’s because Kannadigas are so gracious, so gentle, so talented, and so forward-looking.”While laying the foundation stone for a 10-lane corridor to Electronics City in June 2006, Singh hailed Bengaluru as a ‘global brand’ and said: “People across the world know more about Ban-galore (now Bengaluru) than they do about India.” While attributing the city’s success to warm hospitality extended by its people, Singh had stated: “My sincere advice to you would be that you must zealously preserve this great asset – your hospitality.”Singh was proud of Bengaluru as it was one of thefirst cities that literally rode the wave of economic reforms initiated by him, as finance minister and subsequently as PM. He had exhorted all parts of the state and the country to emulate Bengaluru in becoming home to enterprise, creativity and spirit of adventure a suggestion that culminatedin Bengaluru transforming itself into the startup capital of India .In fact, he was one of the few top Delhi-based leaders who had pinned high hopes on Bengaluru from the word go. Congressman KH Muniyappa, who was a minister in Singh’s cabinet, told TOI: “Singh had emphasised on several occasions that investing in Bengaluru would help the country’s economy in the future. Whenever CMs from Karnataka met him with a list of demands for the state, especially Bengaluru, he extended all possible support.”Singh’s tenure saw several key infrastructure projects getting kickstarted. The 10-lane road to Electronics City, for which he had laid the foundation stone, was a game-changer for the tech-hub that torpedoes the country’s software exports. Other important projects un-dertaken include conversion of Bengaluru-Nelamangala highway stretch in a fourlane highway, upgradation of the Bengaluru-Devanahalli highway and Bengaluru-Kolar highway.Singh laid the foundation stone for Namma Metro on June 24, 2006 and the first Metro stretch from Baiyya-panahalii to MG Road was launched on Nov 20, 2011, during his term. Another important project, Kempegowda International Airport (KIA), was inaugurated during his tenure on May 24, 2008.With regard to city mobility, Bengaluru’s city bus fleet witnessed massive upgradation following procurement of new buses under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM). Volvo buses joined the BMTC fleet in large numbers as part of the mobility programme rolled out during his tenure.","Singh was proud of Bengaluru as it was one of thefirst cities that literally rode the wave of economic reforms initiated by him.

Tech mogul Elon Musk described the philanthropic efforts of MacKenzie Scott, the ex-wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, as ""concerning."" His comment came in response to a social media post scrutinising Scott’s extensive donations, alleging that her initiatives primarily fund non-profits promoting divisive ideologies rather than addressing pressing global issues.The post highlighted Scott’s “trust-based philanthropy ,” which involves providing no-strings-attached grants to over 2,500 non-profits. It alleged that her focus on causes such as racial equity, immigrant rights, and LGBTQ justice feeds what the post described as an “NGO/non-profit complex,” creating jobs for individuals seeking to validate their expensive degrees. The post further detailed Scott’s $16 billion in donations over five years, noting her wealth remains substantial at $36 billion, boosted by Amazon’s rising stock price.Scott, the ex-wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, has become one of the most prolific philanthropists in recent years. Through her “Yield Giving” initiative, she has pledged more than $19 billion since 2019 to causes ranging from girls’ education in Africa to affordable housing in the United States. Scott has championed a transformative approach to philanthropy, providing large, unrestricted grants that allow organisations to allocate funds as needed.In 2024 alone, Scott made repeat donations to several organisations, a rare move given her typical “one-time grant” approach. For example, CAMFED, which supports girls’ education in Africa, received its third donation this year. Another notable beneficiary, Enterprise Community Partners, was unexpectedly awarded an additional $65 million after initially receiving $50 million in 2020.This year also marked a significant shift in Scott’s giving strategy, with her introducing an open-call application process for the first time. Over 6,000 non-profits applied, and Scott committed $640 million to more than 360 organisations, far exceeding her initial promise. Grantees praised the unrestricted nature of her grants, describing them as transformative not only for individual organisations but also for entire sectors like affordable housing.","Elon Musk described the philanthropic efforts of MacKenzie Scott as ""concerning"" His comment came in response to a social media post scrutinising Scott’s extensive donations. Post alleged that her initiatives primarily fund non- profits promoting divisive ideologies rather than addressing pressing global issues.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116717934,imgsize-1821133,width-400,resizemode-4/116717934.jpg"

Immigration policy sparks MAGA civil war, dividing Elon Musk and Trump’s allies",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-are-h-1b-visas-immigration-policy-sparks-maga-civil-war-dividing-elon-musk-and-trumps-allies/articleshow/116736957.cms,"Trump and Musk (File photo)

What are H-1B Visas?

The divide in Trump’s inner circle

What’s next for H-1B Visas?

By the numbers

Background

The H-1B visa program , designed for highly skilled foreign workers, has become a contentious issue within US President-elect Donald Trump’s circle of allies as he prepares for his second administration. Tech leaders like Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy , who support the visa program, are clashing with other right-wing figures who oppose it.H-1B visas are temporary work permits granted to foreign employees in specialized fields requiring advanced knowledge, such as technology, medicine, education, law, and the arts. While heavily used by tech companies hiring engineers, the program also benefits other professional sectors.The visa program has sparked partisan debate. Trump suspended it during his first term, citing its impact on American workers, while the Biden administration streamlined the process to make it more employer-friendly.The controversy escalated with Trump’s appointment of venture capitalist Sriram Krishnan as a senior policy advisor for artificial intelligence. Krishnan, an advocate for easing immigration restrictions for skilled workers, has drawn criticism from far-right figures, including activist Laura Loomer, who called his appointment ""deeply disturbing.""In contrast, Elon Musk defended the program, citing a ""dire shortage of extremely talented engineers in America,"" and likened it to recruiting international players for the NBA. Similarly, Vivek Ramaswamy argued that America’s culture needs to prioritize excellence over mediocrity, emphasizing the necessity of skilled foreign workers.However, critics like right-wing commentator Mike Cernovich accused tech leaders of exploiting the visa system, blaming them for sidelining American workers.Trump has not yet clarified his stance on the H-1B program for his second term. While his focus appears to be on curbing undocumented immigration, his administration’s approach to legal immigration, particularly employment-based visas, remains uncertain.The US issues 65,000 H-1B visas annually, with an additional 20,000 for workers with advanced degrees from US universities. In 2023, over 700,000 individuals held H-1B visas.The growing influence of Silicon Valley in Trump’s orbit highlights the tech sector's vested interest in the administration’s policies. Musk and other tech leaders have become prominent figures in Trump’s inner circle, shaping discussions on immigration and technology policy.While Musk’s endorsement of the H-1B program aligns with the needs of tech companies, it underscores a broader debate about the balance between supporting American workers and attracting global talent to maintain the country’s competitive edge.","Tech leaders like Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy are clashing with other right- wing figures who oppose it.

Taylor Swift And Travis Kelce Spotted Together On A Date Night In NYC



Taylor Swift Is Planning To Leave NYC And Move To Nashville



After a fun star studded Eras-themed birthday party and a Christmas apart from each other, the power couple, global pop star Taylor Swift and her boyfriend, the NFL star and the highest paid tight end in the NFL, Travis Kelce are in New York City. They were seen on a dinner date on Friday, holding hands and lost in each other’s eyes. Both Taylor and Travis also decided to twin on their NYC date night - Taylor decided to wear a black dress, a luxurious Stella McCartney grey blazer on top of the dress and black stockings to complete the look. Travis wore a black shirt, a grey coat and light brown pants.As per reports, the Stella McCartney blazer is worth a whopping $5,500, which for the global pop star, Taylor Swift, is not a lot of money. Taylor kept her hair open for the date night and framed her face with bangs. She also opted for a red lip and minimal jewellery. Travis was spotted wearing a silver chain which completed his overall look.As per the Kansas City Chiefs’ journalist Pete Sweeney who recently appeared on the “New Day with SSJ” podcast and revealed that the tight end of the Kansas City Chiefs will be travelling to New York City to spend the rest of the holiday season with his girlfriend. While Pete did not name anyone in the podcast, it is quite easy to assume that the person he referred to is none other than Travis Kelce, boyfriend of the global pop star Taylor Swift who is also a self made billionaire. This makes sense now as they have spotted out on a date night in the same city.As per reports, Taylor has been planning to move to her home in Nashville so that she can be closer to Travis who currently resides in the Kansas City. This is not the only reason for which Taylor is planning to move though; her mother, Andrea Swift, also has a soft spot for Nashville and this has motivated Taylor more to consider leaving her residence in New York City and moving to her residence in Nashville.Currently, Taylor lives in a New York City apartment that is worth $50 million. She has been smart with her money and has invested in real estate even in Nashville where she owns an apartment and a mansion.As per reports, Travis plans to spend the New Year's Eve with his girlfriend Taylor and then extend his stay in New York City for a couple of more days and join in the playoffs which starts next month. He might not be playing against the Denver Broncos on 5th January and might be spotted only when the Kansas City Chiefs start playing in the playoffs. However, nothing has been confirmed yet.Also Read: Josh Allen’s Christmas gift to Hailee Steinfeld is a personalized Buffalo Bills jacket that has fans talking",Taylor Swift And Travis Kelce Spotted Together On A Date Night In NYC.

Immigration sparks ‘India vs MAGA’ Rift

A growing feud between Elon Musk and MAGA supporters unfolded on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, as several influencers accused the billionaire of silencing them following a clash over immigration and H-1B visas . Prominent MAGA influencer Laura Loomer alleged her account was downgraded from premium, removing her blue tick and blocking monetization, after criticizing foreign workers and immigration policies .“I have now also been banned from being able to purchase premium. We are always told to buy premium. But if you criticize immigration, you get your premium check taken away and also get banned from buying Premium. Pure censorship . MAGA has been silenced,” Loomer posted on X.At least ten other MAGA influencers echoed similar grievances, accusing Musk of censorship. X has not issued an official response to the claims.In what appeared to be his response, Musk tweeted: “That said, any accounts found to be engaged in coordinated attacks to spam target accounts with mute/blocks will themselves be categorized – correctly – as spam. Live by the spam, die by the spam.”The controversy began when Loomer criticized the appointment of Sriram Krishnan , an Indian-American, as Trump’s AI policy adviser. She targeted Indian immigrants in a series of incendiary tweets, labeling them “third-world invaders” and making disparaging remarks about India.Musk came to Krishnan’s defense and addressed the immigration debate, tweeting, “The ‘fixed pie’ fallacy is at the heart of much wrong-headed economic thinking. There is essentially infinite potential for job and company creation. Think of all the things that didn’t exist 20 or 30 years ago!”MAGA figures, including Loomer and former presidential candidate Nikki Haley , criticized Musk’s stance. The debate deepened with the involvement of Trump ally Vivek Ramaswamy, who defended H-1B visas, aligning with Musk’s pro-immigration perspective.As tensions rise, President-elect Donald Trump has yet to comment on the discord among his supporters over the contentious issue."," MAGA influencer Laura Loomer alleged her account was downgraded from premium, removing her blue tick and blocking monetization.

Furthering his view on the contentions H-1B visa, Elon Musk cited the example of Nikola Tesla who was an immigrant to America and said ""we named Tesla after Nikola Tesla, one of the greatest engineers ever"". To this, X users corrected him and added that Elon Musk did not name the company Tesla as he joined the company in 2004, a year after the company was founded by Eberhard and Tarpenning in 2003.Some social media users even claimed that Nikola Tesla was middle class and his uncle was a high-ranking army member and can not be called ""penniless"".Elon Musk also shared a Grok (X's AI) note on Nikola Tesla's contribution.Born in a Serb family in the village of Smiljan, Nikola Tesla studied engineering and physics in the 1870s without receiving a degree. Then he worked at Continental Efiroe and immigrated to the United States in 1884. Later on, he became a naturalized American citizen.H-1B is the American visa that allows companies to hire foreign workers. As of now, every country has an equal cap on the number of H-1B visas. Donald Trump's pick for the AI advisor Sriram Krishnan said the cap should be removed to allow more foreign workers to come to the US. While Elon Musk, Vivek Ramaswamy supported the idea, MAGA old-timers said this is against the America First policy. The controversy boiled down to an Elon Musk versus Laura Loomer fight on X in which Elon Musk said the GOP should get rid of these voices.Only Vivek Ramaswamy among these three technocrats were born in the US and thus a natural US citizen.

Green cards with diplomas: A shift in rhetoric?

Tech leaders weigh in

Defenders respond

A balancing act

Amid the ongoing debate over skilled immigration , Green Cards, and the H-1B visa program in the US, President-elect Donald Trump's proposal on immigration and labor policies is back into the spotlight, reigniting the contentious debates that dominated his first presidency. While Trump, known for his harsh stance on immigration, now faces both support and backlash for softening his approach toward foreign talent, the issue is far from resolved.During his 2024 campaign, Trump proposed that foreign students graduating from US colleges—especially from countries like India and China—should automatically receive Green Cards. His rationale was to prevent these students from leaving the US to start billion-dollar ventures abroad. ""If you graduate from a US college, you should automatically get a Green Card as part of your diploma,"" Trump said, calling it a missed opportunity for American growth.This marked a stark departure from Trump’s earlier policies, including his criticism of the H-1B visa program, which he had called a ""theft of American prosperity."" While the H-1B visa allows American companies to hire skilled foreign workers, Trump argued it exploited foreign labor at the expense of US citizens.Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, co-chairs of Trump’s new “Department of Government Efficiency,” have defended the tech industry’s reliance on foreign talent, citing a domestic shortage of skilled engineers. Musk, responding to criticism on his platform X, claimed the US lacks enough ""super talented and motivated"" engineers, while Ramaswamy blamed cultural factors for the gap in competitive US-born candidates.The debate intensified after Sriram Krishnan , Trump’s senior policy advisor on artificial intelligence, suggested lifting caps on Green Cards for skilled immigrants. Critics like far-right activist Laura Loomer accused Krishnan of undermining Trump’s “America First” agenda, claiming it prioritizes foreign STEM graduates over American workers.Conservative tech leaders defended Krishnan, emphasizing that his proposals focus on a merit-based Green Card system. David Sacks, tapped to serve as Trump’s AI and crypto czar, clarified that Krishnan supports a skills-driven program, not an unrestricted one. Joe Lonsdale, co-founder of Palantir, added that attracting the “best and brightest” is crucial for maintaining US global leadership, while rejecting lower-skilled immigration.As Trump prepares to implement his controversial immigration policies, including mass deportations, the push to attract top foreign talent underscores the tension between nationalist priorities and economic realities in the tech sector. Whether Trump can balance his “America First” agenda with the demands of Silicon Valley remains to be seen.","Trump proposed that foreign students graduating from US colleges should automatically receive Green Cards.

OpenAI’s statement

In October, 26-year-old Indian-origin tech researcher and former OpenAI employee, Suchir Balaji , made headlines when he criticised OpenAI in an interview with The New York Times, voicing concerns over potential copyright violations by leading AI companies.Balaji, who played a key role in organising data for OpenAI’s models, resigned in August, calling its practices unfair. By November, The New York Times' lawyers named him as a key figure in their copyright case against OpenAI.""If you believe what I believe, you have to just leave,"" he told the Times.However, on November 26, shortly after his 26th birthday, Balaji was found dead in his San Francisco apartment. Authorities ruled his death a suicide, yet his family remains unconvinced, pushing for a deeper investigation.Poornima Ramarao , Balaji’s mother offered clues about her son’s tragedy in an exclusive interview with Business Insider.She revealed that Balaji joined OpenAI in 2018 as an intern and later rose to a pivotal position, contributing to the development of ChatGPT.A brilliant mind from a young age, he built a computer at 13, wrote a science paper on chip design at 14, and won a national programming contest in high school. At 17, he was recruited by Quora, where his talent blossomed further.""As a toddler, as a little 5-year-old, he never made mistakes. He was perfect,"" recalled his mother who was a software engineer.""Dad would say, 'Don't focus too much. Don't push him too much,'"" she said.Balaji’s career took off when he joined OpenAI full-time after graduating from UC Berkeley, where he had already earned $100,000 in a TSA-sponsored challenge to improve passenger-screening algorithms.But as OpenAI shifted from its nonprofit, open-source roots to a more profit-driven model, Balaji grew increasingly disillusioned. His mother revealed that he feared AI’s potential harm to society and the publishing industry.""He felt AI is a harm to humanity,"" Ramarao said.Balaji publicly voiced his concerns about AI’s ethical implications, especially regarding copyright, he criticised OpenAI’s use of publicly available internet data for profit, questioning its impact on creators' livelihoods.By late 2023, Balaji had lost enthusiasm for his work at OpenAI and began openly criticising CEO Sam Altman , as per family accounts. After resigning, he planned to start a machine-learning nonprofit in the medical field.She shared that she had a close bond with her son and recalled driving him to his office in Mountain View during his time at Quora.She toldthat she initially worried about how Balaji would manage among ""so many adults,"" but he quickly adapted, making friends to play poker with and enjoying Quora’s well-stocked cafeteria. It became a lesson in trusting her son.""That’s when I realised my son is truly advanced, and I shouldn’t hold him back,"" Ramarao said.She would arrange Costco shipments to his apartment to ensure he had enough fruit and often brought granola bars and cookies during her visits, knowing he tended to skip breakfast.She also revealed that Balaji often used to conceal his emotions and always paid for everything.She mentioned that during their last meal together on November 7, she asked Suchir if, despite the hardships and the way she had raised him, he would still choose her as his mother if given the choice.“He didn't think for a second,'"" she said. ""'Yes, mom.' And you know what? As a mother, that will keep me going as long as I'm alive.""Balaji’s death has left his family and friends grappling with grief, unanswered questions, and conspiracy theories. The San Francisco police ruled out foul play, citing CCTV footage showing he was alone. However, a private autopsy commissioned by the family yielded ""atypical"" results, according to Ramarao, though details remain undisclosed.Balaji's parents are advocating for the case to be reopened, emphasising the vulnerabilities of whistleblowers. A Change.org petition and a social media campaign aim to raise awareness, while an event in his memory is planned for December 27.""We want to leave the question open,"" Ramarao said.""It doesn't look like a normal situation.""However, Ramarao emphasized that the family isn't pointing fingers at OpenAI.She revealed that Balaji took a break from work after leaving OpenAI in August.""He said, 'I'm not taking up another job. Don't ask me.'""From his parents' perspective, all seemed well with the young coder. He was financially secure, with enough OpenAI stock to potentially buy a house, and had plans to start a machine-learning nonprofit focused on healthcare.""He wanted to do something for society,"" his mom said.On November 21, Balaji celebrated his 26th birthday with friends during a vacation. The following day, he told his mother about his flight details and spoke with his father before dinner, who wished him a happy birthday and mentioned sending a gift. According to Ramarao, the medical examiner's office concluded that Balaji passed away either that evening or the following morning.""He was upbeat and happy,"" she said. ""What can go wrong within a few hours that his life is lost?""Ramarao told that she did not hear from her son on Saturday and Sunday and thought that maybe he had lost his phone or gone for a hike. On Monday, she went to his apartment and knocked on the door, but there was no answer. She considered filing a missing-person report, but hesitated, knowing she would need to go to the police station in person to cancel it later.""He'll get mad at me,"" she thought.The following morning, she called the San Francisco police which found his body just after 1 pm.Ramarao said she was not informed about what had happened nor allowed inside his apartment. As officers arrived, she begged them to check if his laptop and toothbrush were missing, hoping it would indicate whether he had left.""They didn't give the news to me,"" Ramaro said, ""I'm still sitting there thinking, 'My son is traveling. He's gone somewhere.'Around 2 pm, she was told to go home which she refused.""I sat there firmly,"" Ramarao told BI.Around 3:20 pm, a long white van arrived with its light on.""I was waiting to see medical help or nurses or someone coming out of the van,"" adding, ""But a stretcher came. A simple stretcher. I ran and asked the person. He said, 'We have a dead body in that apartment.'""About an hour later, a medical examiner and police officers requested a private meeting with Ramarao in the apartment's office. They informed her that Balaji had died by suicide and, based on CCTV footage, he had been alone. The department spokesperson toldthere was no initial evidence of foul play.However, Balaji's parents remain unconvinced and arranged for a private autopsy, which was completed in early December.Balaji's parents are working with an attorney to press the San Francisco police to reopen the case and do a ""proper investigation.""An OpenAI spokesperson expressed that Balaji was a valued member of the team, and his passing has had a profound impact on his colleagues.“We were devastated to learn of this tragic news and have been in touch with Suchir's family to offer our full support during this difficult time,"" the spokesperson wrote in a statement.The spokesperson further added that the company first became aware of Suchir’s concerns when The New York Times published his comments.""We respect his, and others', right to share views freely. Our hearts go out to Suchir's loved ones, and we extend our deepest condolences to all who are mourning his loss.""","Suchir Balaji, a 26-year-old Indian-origin tech researcher and former OpenAI employee, was found dead in his San Francisco apartment. Authorities ruled his death a suicide, yet his family remains unconvinced, pushing for a deeper investigation. His mother revealed that he feared AI’s potential harm to society and the publishing industry.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116719855,imgsize-199390,width-400,resizemode-4/116719855.jpg"

Dell Technologies founder and CEO Michael Dell has a message for young tech professionals: parents' advice isn’t always wrong—but it’s not always right either.Worth $115 billion, Dell recently reflected on how pursuing his passion for computers, despite his parents’ preference for him to attend medical school, led to the creation of an $88 billion revenue company.""Well, yeah, your parents aren't always right, but they're not always wrong either,"" Dell said on the ""In Good Company"" podcast, adding that people's ""mileage may vary on the parents.""The 59-year-old tech leader encouraged young people to take bold risks and forge their own paths.

"'Big screen still the big draw':OTT is streaming in, but Tamil Nadu’s multiplexes with their larger-than-life experience continue to steal the show",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/big-screen-still-the-big-drawott-is-streaming-in-but-tamil-nadus-multiplexes-with-their-larger-than-life-experience-continue-to-steal-the-show/articleshow/116758135.cms,"SHOWTIME: Theatres still pull crowds for first-day-firstshows

Despite having access to multiple OTT platforms and a world of international content at his fingertips, S Balaji still finds himself rushing to a theatre whenever his ‘Thalaivar’ Rajinikanth has a movie releasing. “I remember dashing to theatres, holding my father’s hand, for the first day-first show of Rajinikanth’s film,” says Balaji.Twenty-five years later, much has changed — his taste in movies has broadened to include Malayalam, Telugu, Hindi and international cinema thanks to OTT platforms — but one thing remains constant: the draw of the theatre. This Oct, when the superstar’s ‘Vettaiyan’ hit the screens, you bet Balaji was there.Streaming OTT platforms have transformed movie watching globally, attracting more than 500 million users in India in recent years and positioning themselves as a gallery of diverse content. Yet, movie theatres, despite facing numerous challenges over the last quarter-century, have held their own against the digital wave and continue to be the prime form of entertainment by constantly upgrading themselves to provide a premium experience to patrons.From dirty single screen dungeons, to air-conditioned multiplexes, to swanky movie theatres in malls with crystal clear pictures and immersive sound experience and plush seats, IMAX screens and booking tickets online, moviegoing has only got more premium with time.While the era of single screens has more or less come to an end — Agasthya Theatre in North Chennai, one of Asia’s largest single-screen venues with more than 1,000 seats and which famously ran Rajinikanth’s ‘Sivaji’ for a record-breaking 1,000 days, brought its curtains down recently — the trend now is multiplexes screening up to 20 films in multiple languages at once, offering flexibility and catering to diverse tastes.This move gave audiences the chance to enjoy films in Tamil , Telugu, Hindi and English all under one roof, broadening their cinematic experience.“In 1995, Tamil Nadu had 4,000 screens,” says M Sreedhar, secretary of Tamil Nadu Theatre Owners’ Association. “It reduced to about 800 in the 2000s. Now, there are 1,125 screens across the state and many single theatres have added additional screens.”Sreedhar says standalone theatres now give corporate chains a run for their money by providing the same experience, right from the seating. Many theatres spend about ₹6,000 per seat. Standalone theatres such as Rohini, Casino, Vetteri, Woodlands and Kamala have reinvented themselves and offer amenities at competitive prices.Today, Chennai boasts nearly 300 multiplex screens, contributing to Tamil Nadu’s total of 1,000-plus operational screens. In 2023, theatres in the state generated more than ₹1,200 crore in box-of| fice collections, with Tamil films accounting for 60% of the revenue, showing that despite the surge in OTT platforms, the experience remains central to the industry’s success.The pandemic accelerated the OTT boom, with direct-to-digital releases becoming more common. Actor Suriya led this change, releasing films such as ‘Soorarai Pottru’ and ‘Jai Bhim’ on Amazon Prime Video, earning both critical acclaim and a global audience.Yet, even with the convenience of home-viewing, theatres made a strong comeback once the lockdown was lifted. In 2023, blockbuster releases such as Vijay’s ‘Leo’ and Rajinikanth’s ‘Jailer’ reignited the communal joy of movie-watching. These films grossed more than ₹600 crore globally, reaffirming that nothing beats the magic of the big screen.For movie producers and filmmakers, the digital era has made the audience the king, which has left little scope for directors to make mistakes. “With the huge exposure to a variety of content during Covid pandemic, the audience now goes hard on filmmakers and decides how a movie should be and what to watch in theatres and on TV in their living room.People prefer the theatres for the larger-than-life experience, which is why movies such as ‘Pushpa’ do great in theatres, while they also made movies such as ‘Maharaja’, ‘Lubber Pandhu’, ‘Love Today’ and ‘Amaran’ a hit since they found the content relatable, unique and interesting,” says film producer S R Prabhu of Dream Warrior Pictures. “While the ecosystem has made it tricky for filmmakers, it is a challenge we have to crack.”Contrary to the belief that OTT platforms would threaten the ex istence of theatres, over the past decade, they’ve quietly killed the trend of watching movies on satel lite channels, which was once the popular choice.No one likes to watch movies interrupted by ump teen ads. In the process, it has only been good for theatres as Prabhu points out. “The satellite business for movies is gone and OTT platforms too have become choosy about movies, as they realised mere combination of directors and actors without a strong script will not work. So, the movie industry is back to relying on theatres,” he says.OTT platforms have also changed audience behaviour. Viewers no longer feel the urgency to visit theatres, knowing they can watch the same film on TV or streaming platforms within the next four weeks. This has shortened the lifespan of movies on the big screen, with most now running for just a weekend.A film now needs to be exceptional to last more than a week at the box office.The Tamil Nadu govt’s cap on ticket prices in 2007 at ₹120 is one of the major factors why it remains affordable here and relevant to lower middle income groups, though theatres and producers have been pushing for dynamic pricing of tickets for at least the big star movies.Some theatres such as Rohini and Albert still pull heavy fan-crowd for first-day-first-show shows, with fireworks celebrations, while the experience for fans transcended beyond Chennai of late, with many catching 4am first shows of their stars at Nagari in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh or Bengaluru, as Tamil Nadu only screens shows from 9am.As long as movie-going is affordable, rich in experience and the content is good, theatres are here to stay.","Streaming OTT platforms have transformed movie watching globally, attracting more than 500 million users in India in recent years.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%.

Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%.

But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. A greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/exemptions is the need of the hour.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

A woman in Horry County, US state of South Carolina, has sued Walmart and a delivery driver, alleging the driver was found ""pleasuring himself"" in her driveway after delivering groceries in July.The lawsuit, filed on December 19, claims Alvin B Ortiz exposed himself in his vehicle after delivering groceries on July 8. The incident occurred around 9:10 am local time in an Intracoastal Waterway community . The woman, identified as “Jane Doe,” alleges that Ortiz, 39, remained in his car in her driveway for 10–15 minutes after the delivery. When she approached his vehicle, she says she saw “his pants pulled down” and him “pleasuring himself.”The lawsuit says the woman retreated into her home with her child and called a neighbor for help. The neighbor confronted Ortiz, who then allegedly drove away, yelling “he was coming back to ‘f--- everyone up.’” The woman reported the incident to the police, who subsequently contacted the Walmart where Ortiz was employed.Ortiz was arrested on July 9 and charged with indecent exposure, according to the lawsuit. He was released on bond the next day, and court records indicate his case remains pending.The lawsuit accuses Walmart of failing to conduct adequate background checks and holds the company responsible for the actions of its employee while on duty. The woman seeks compensation for “past and future mental pain and suffering, mental, emotional, and psychological damage, and loss of enjoyment of life,” including medical expenses.Walmart told WMBF News “the safety of our associates and customers is always a top priority” and mentioned that the company’s lawyers “are reviewing the complaint and will respond appropriately to the court.”","A woman in Horry County, US state of South Carolina, has sued Walmart and a delivery driver.
