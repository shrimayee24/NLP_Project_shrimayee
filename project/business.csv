‘It is laughable’: Maulana Rashidi reacts to RSS chief's 'Hindu rastra' call; terms it vote bank politics,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/it-is-laughable-maulana-rashidi-reacts-to-rss-chiefs-hindu-rastra-call-terms-it-vote-bank-politics/articleshow/126132191.cms,"‘Have To Stay United’: RSS Chief Mohan Bhagwat On Atrocities Against Hindus In Bangladesh

NEW DELHI: All India Imam Association president Maulana Sajid Rashidi on Monday criticised RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat ’s remarks on India being a Hindu Rashtra, saying the idea went against the Constitution and the country’s democratic character.Responding to Bhagwat’s statement that India is a Hindu Rashtra and that the Constitution’s preamble reflects this., Rashidi said, ""...He does not know that a Hindu rashtra can only be a slogan. Those who are singing the praises of the Hindu nation want to crush the constitution. India is not of one religion but of 140 crore residents. If there is a Hindu kingdom, then the constitution of India will die. We see that all the Islamic countries, where the principles of the Quran are followed, are not democratic countries. It has become a religious country..""Reacting to Bhagwat’s view that the culture of the majority should be respected and not opposed, Rashidi questioned how can Hindus who are in majority be threatened terming the assertion “laughable.”“In Dubai there are 8 per cent Hindu, 5 per cent Hindu in Oman, 15 per cent in Saudi Arabia they are all safe. Here you’ve 80 per cent Hindus; majority and they are not safe? It is laughable, and you’re saying that in a country where from PM to peon is a Hindu.All the judges are Hindu, IAS, IPS are Hindu and still the 80 per cent Hindus are in danger,” he added.He alleged that fanning insecurity among the majority community was politically motivated and purely oriented for vote bank politics.“Telling Hindus that they are in danger is just the politics of the vote bank, it has nothing to do with the constitution,” he said, adding, “I believe that RSS is a big organisation. Its leaders should talk very thoughtfully. The contradictions in his remarks are glaring,” he said.Rashidi further also referred to Bhagwat’s earlier comments acknowledging the historical and continuing presence of Muslims in India, and then contradicting them saying, he is the chief of a big organisation like RSS he should make comments after thorough thinking. “On one hand he says there is no India without Muslims. Muslims were always there, are and will always be, then he says everybody living here is a Hindu, they don’t consider them Muslims . ..”Warning of constitutional consequences, if India were to be a Hindu rastra he said, “The day this country becomes a Hindu rashtra, that day the constitution will be over, then Manusmriti will be implemented and then whatever is told in it will happen with Dalits and other religions ...”Earlier on Sunday Mohan Bhagwat speaking at Kolkata Vyakhyanmala, a session to celebrate the centenary of RSS, said seeing RSS through the lens of BJP is a big mistake.He further added, ""There are people who spread wrong narratives about the Sangh. Interpretation of the Sangh should be objective and not through secondary sources. The goal of the Sangh is organisation of the entire Hindu society, but it is not aimed at opposing others...If you see that Sangh is anti-Muslim, you can make (that) your opinion. But change your opinion if you don't find that.""",All India Imam Association president Maulana Sajid Rashidi criticised RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat ’s remarks on India being a Hindu Rashtra.

Ex-CM Baghel's son got Rs 250 crore as his share from Chhattisgarh liquor 'scam': Chargesheet,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ex-cm-baghels-son-got-rs-250-crore-as-his-share-from-chhattisgarh-liquor-scam-chargesheet/articleshow/126132442.cms,"RAIPUR: Chaitanya, son of former Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel , received Rs 200 crore to Rs 250 crore as his share from an alleged liquor scam in the state, the Anti-Corruption Bureau/Economic Offence Wing (ACB/EOW) has claimed in its chargesheet.The state police's ACB/EOW, in its seventh supplementary chargesheet in the multi-crore liquor scam filed before a special court here on Monday, claimed Chaitanya Baghel played a key role in establishing, coordinating, and protecting an extortion racket (syndicate) within the excise department (during the previous Congress government, which was in office from 2018-23).The voluminous document, running into around 3,800 pages, has named Chaitnaya Baghel as an accused in the alleged scam pegged at more than Rs 3,000 crore, an ACB/EOW statement said.With this, a total of eight chargesheets have been filed in the case so far.The latest chargesheet details the current status of the investigation against the arrested accused, along with digital evidence reports about all those in custody. The document also outlines the progress of the ongoing probe against the accused persons.The statement quoting the chargesheet said Chaitanya Baghel acted as coordinator among officials such as Anil Tuteja, Soumya Chaurasia, Arunpati Tripathi, and Niranjan Das, who worked in line with the syndicate's interests at the administrative level and as ground-level operatives of the network, such as Anwar Dhebar, Arvind Singh, and Vikas Agarwal (all co-accused), and issued instructions to them.Chaitanya Baghel worked through his trusted associates to transfer and manage proceeds of the scam collected by businessman Anwar Dhebar's team, moving the funds to higher levels, it claimed.He allegedly received his share of the proceeds through various firms belonging to liquor businessman Trilok Singh Dhillon, transferring it through banking channels to his family firms and using it in real estate projects.Furthermore, he was also found to have received and invested large sums of money generated out of the scam through banking channels via his family members, friends, and associates, the chargesheet claimed.The probe agency said, ""Evidence indicates that Chaitanya, along with managing the proceeds of the crime at a higher level, received around Rs 200 crore-Rs 250 crore as his share.""The investigation has also revealed that high-level protection, policy/administrative intervention, and influence provided to the syndicate by Chaitanya Baghel enabled this crime to be perpetrated for a long period, it claimed.""The ongoing investigation suggests the amount involved in the liquor scam is estimated to be approximately Rs 3,074 crore. However, further investigation suggests the total amount of the proceeds of crime generated out of the alleged scam could exceed Rs 3,500 crore,"" it added.The Enforcement Directorate (ED), which is probing the money laundering angle in the alleged scam, arrested Chaitanya Baghel on July 18 following a search at his house, which he shares with his father, a Congress politician, in Bhilai town of Durg district.As per the ED's prosecution complaint (chargesheet) filed earlier, Chaitanya Baghel ""handled"" more than Rs 1,000 crore worth of ""proceeds of crime"" generated from a liquor ""scam"" in the state.The central agency has stated that the alleged scam resulted in a ""massive loss"" to the state exchequer and filled the pockets of beneficiaries of a liquor syndicate.The scam was orchestrated between 2019 and 2022 when then-CM Bhupesh Baghel headed the Congress government in Chhattisgarh.Money was ""illegally"" collected from ""every"" bottle of liquor sold in Chhattisgarh (between 2019 and 2022), said the anti-money laundering agency.Chaitanya Baghel was arrested by the ACB/EOW in September while he was in jail under judicial custody.The ED in January arrested former excise minister and Congress leader Kawasi Lakhma, businessman Anwar Dhebar (brother of Congress leader and former Raipur Mayor Aijaz Dhebar), former IAS officer Anil Tuteja, Indian Telecom Service (ITS) officer Arunpati Tripathi and a few others as part of their probe in the case.The EOW/ACB registered an FIR on January 17, 2024, in the alleged scam, naming 70 individuals and companies, including Lakhma and former chief secretary Vivek Dhand.After his son was arrested, former CM Baghel claimed that the action was taken because the Congress, during its rule, tried to stop the cutting of forests and mining activities in the state.The Congress leader also alleged that the probe agencies were being misused to target Opposition leaders.

Rahul Gandhi's Congress with his ideological patron George Soros wants Chaos, Unrest in Indian Democracy. Rahul goes abroad for uniting such Anti India forces,"" Bhandari wrote on a post on X.""Congress hates Indian Democracy. Congress hates Bharat's progress. Rahul Gandhi's Congress wants Anarchy!"" he added.Union minister of state Shobha Karandjale also attacked Congress leader, claiming that he goes abroad to ""speak against the nation.""""Rahul Gandhi is not the leader of opposition but an anti-India leader who goes abroad and speaks against the nation. What does he aim to gain by doing this? He still behaves like a child, not a leader.""""There is no talk about development in Karnataka but only about who will remain as the CM,"" she added.Earlier, while addressing an event at Hertie School in Berlin, Rahul Gandhi accused the BJP of ""capturing the country's institutional framework"", terming it an ""attack"" on the democratic system.Rahul alleged that the Centre has ""weaponised"" investigating agencies, suggesting a quid pro quo in which businessmen in India financially support the BJP rather than Opposition parties.""There is a wholesale capture of our instituteonal framework. Our intelligence agencies, ED and CBI, have been weaponised. ED and CBI have zero cases against the BJP, and most of the political cases are against the people who oppose them. If you are a businessman and try to support the Congress, you are threatened. BJP uses the institutional framework of India as a tool to build political power. Look at the money the BJP has and the opposition has,"" he said.""There is an attack on the democratic system. We have to find ways to counter this. We will create a system of opposition resistance that will succeed. We are not fighting the BJP, but their capture of the Indian institutional structure,"" he added.Further, the Congress leader claimed that India and the West have ""handed over"" the production of goods to China and said that Made in China goods have crippled job creation in democracies, fuelling political turbulence across India, the United States and Europe.""The West and to an extent India, have handed over production to the Chinese. China dominates production today, which means that it is difficult to give employment to a large number of people. Countries like India, the US and Germany cannot give their employment based on services. How do democracies produce in this transition? What are the models that are required, how do you think about production in a democratic environment, and what are the types of partnerships that India, the US and Europe can create for production? It will become very difficult for democracy to sustain itself if we are not able to produce,"" he said.""A huge part of the turbulence that we are seeing in Europe, India and the US, polarisation of politics, is because we are not able to give our people jobs, which is because we said: China, you produce for the world,"" he added.Rahul Gandhi is on a five-day visit to Germany.His remarks come after he had claimed that manufacturing in India is declining.During his visit to the BMW World museum in Munich, Germany, on December 17, he said, ""Manufacturing is the backbone of strong economies. Sadly, in India, manufacturing is declining. For us to accelerate growth, we need to produce more - build meaningful manufacturing ecosystems, and create high-quality jobs at scale.""However, BJP spokesperson Pradeep Bhandari refuted the Lok Sabha LoP's claim, calling it ""fake news"" against India's growth story.The BJP Spokesperson, in an X post, claimed 495 per cent growth in total electronics manufacturing in the last 10 years, with exports growing by 760 per cent, and a 14 times increase in the automobile manufacturing since 1991.","Bharatiya Janata Party launches broadside against Rahul Gandhi after he targeted saffron party.

‘Not Misleading Propaganda’: Bangladesh Responds To India Over Delhi High Commission Protest

Srinagar (Jammu and Kashmir) [India], December 23 (ANI): The Jammu and Kashmir Students Association (JKSA) on Monday wrote to the Prime Minister Narendra Modi , seeking urgent intervention to ensure the safety and well-being of Indian medical students currently studying in Bangladesh amid ongoing protests, tensions, and incidents of violence, particularly in Dhaka and surrounding regions.In the letter addressed to the Prime Minister, the Association urged him to intervene to ensure the safety and protection of Indian medical students in view of the prevailing unrest and uncertain conditions in Bangladesh.National Convenor of the Association, Nasir Khuehami, said that there are around 9,000 Indian students pursuing medical education in various colleges across Bangladesh, among them over 4,000 students from the Kashmir Valley.Khuehami said, ""We have been told by students studying in Dhaka that they have been advised to hide their identity for their own safety, which is deeply disturbing and unacceptable for young Indians who have gone abroad solely to pursue education."" He added that the reported ""death and lynching of a student leader has further shocked and alarmed the entire student community and their families back home,"" underlining the gravity of the situation and the potential risks faced by Indian students on the ground.Highlighting the plight of students, the Association said, ""Many students are confined to hostels and accommodations, facing restrictions on movement, lack of clarity, and fear of being caught in violence. Parents in India are living in constant anxiety, unsure about the safety of their children. The prevailing conditions are unsafe and uncertain, and students feel vulnerable and stranded.""Khuehami said the Association has been receiving distress calls and messages from students and their families, who are extremely anxious about the rapidly deteriorating situation and the atmosphere of fear and uncertainty prevailing there.Urging immediate action, Khuehami said, ""We urge the Prime Minister to kindly intervene to ensure the immediate safety and protection of Indian medical students in Bangladesh. We request the Ministry of External Affairs and the Indian High Commission in Dhaka to urgently take up this matter with the Government of Bangladesh and seek firm assurances for the security, dignity, and well-being of our students.""The Association also appealed for evacuation if the situation worsens, stating, ""If the situation of tension and violence continues or worsens, the Government of India should kindly consider making arrangements to evacuate and bring back Indian students safely to India, so that no young life is put at risk. Timely evacuation, if required, will go a long way in preventing any untoward incident and in reassuring anxious families across the country. ""Reposing faith in the leadership of the Prime Minister, the Association said, ""India has always stood by its citizens abroad in times of crisis. We are confident that every possible step will be taken to protect our students and uphold India's responsibility towards its youth.

CHENNAI: A tiny needle system that sends cancer drugs directly into breast cancer cells, while protecting healthy ones, has been developed by researchers from IIT Madras and two Australian universities - Monash University and Deakin University. The nanotechnology injection delivery system packs the anticancer drug, doxorubicin, into special protective bubbles, then pushes it inside cells using needle-shaped silicon tubes on a chip.""It was a study on petri dishes,"" said IIT-M assistant professor Dr Swathi Sudhakar, who works with the department of applied mechanics and biomedical engineering. ""We could release the drug directly, but that would be faster delivery. So, for sustained release, it was wrapped in a bubble and pushed into it. Lab tests on breast cancer cells showed the drugs stopped cell growth, killed cancer cells, and blocked new blood vessels for tumours,"" Dr Sudhakar said.Breast cancer is one of the most common types of cancer affecting women in both urban and rural areas. In cities such as Chennai, 28% of cancers in women are breast cancers, followed by cervix (14%), ovary (6%), and corpus uteri (4%).Conventional treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation often harm non-cancerous tissues due to systemic drug exposure, causing side effects.Results of the study published in the peer-reviewed journal Advanced Materials Interfaces show the new system worked 23 times better than the drug alone. ""It had higher potential even when used in smaller amounts. There is thermal stability and long-term drug release, up to 700 hours, and it addresses common drawbacks of existing nanocarrier systems, such as burst release and poor compatibility,"" she said.The technology, they said, is a reliable and scalable candidate for future trials.","Nanotechnology injection system packs anticancer drug, doxorubicin, into special protective bubbles.

NEW DELHI: Disrupted sleep, rising stress levels and central obesity are emerging as major drivers of India's growing breast cancer burden, which is projected to rise by 5.6% annually and add nearly 50,000 new cases every year, according to a major new study by the ICMR-National Centre for Disease Informatics and Research.The systematic review and meta-analysis analysed Indian studies published up to Dec 22, 2024, to identify population-specific risk factors. Of nearly 1,900 scientific papers screened, 31 observational studies of moderate to high quality were included.Among lifestyle-related factors, individual studies showed a positive association between breast cancer risk and poor sleep quality, irregular sleep patterns, sleeping in illuminated rooms and high stress levels - reflecting the impact of urbanisation and changing work-life patterns. Regular physical activity, the researchers noted, was consistently associated with a lower risk.Central obesity was identified as a critical factor, with women having a waist-to-hip ratio of 0.85 or higher facing significantly elevated risk. Abdominal fat, researchers noted, plays a more decisive role than overall body weight, particularly among postmenopausal women.Clinicians say these lifestyle shifts are increasingly shaping breast cancer patterns in India.Dr Samit Purohit, director of medical oncology at Action Cancer Hospital, said breast cancer is no longer driven only by age or inherited risk. ""Disrupted sleep cycles, chronic stress and central obesity are becoming silent but powerful contributors, as they alter hormonal balance, immune surveillance and inflammatory pathways,"" he said, adding that irregular sleep suppresses melatonin-a hormone with protective anti-cancer properties-while chronic stress leads to sustained cortisol elevation and metabolic dysfunction.The meta-analysis also found strong links with reproductive and hormonal factors, including late menopause (after 50 years), delayed first pregnancy or childbirth (after 30), multiple abortions and higher age at marriage, all of which increase lifetime hormonal exposure. Family history of cancer, particularly breast cancer, emerged as one of the strongest predictors of risk.Researchers noted India's breast cancer risk profile differs from Western populations, where hormone replacement therapy and early menarche are dominant factors. In India, the convergence of lifestyle disruption, reproductive delay and metabolic risk is reshaping disease patterns.The study called for large, population-based prospective cohort studies and stronger emphasis on prevention and early screening.","India's breast cancer burden is projected to rise by 5.6% annually and add nearly 50,000 new cases every year.

Aravalli Hills Row: Why Definition Battle Could Decide Mining Water Security And AQI In North India

NEW DELHI: Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav on Monday again addressed a press conference amid outrage over the ""new definition"" of the Aravali range, saying that ""no new mining leases will be permitted, especially in core, protected and ecologically sensitive areas, including the NCR"".Speaking on the Supreme Court's acceptance of the ""new definition"" of Aravalli, the minister said: ""The ruling recognises and endorses the Government of India’s sustained efforts to protect the Aravalli range through scientific assessment, strict safeguards and initiatives such as the Aravalli Green Wall Project.""He futher highlighted the expansion of Ramsar sites, afforestation drives and international recognition of India’s forest cover, saying that under the BJP-led NDA government remains ""firmly committed to balancing ecology and economy, while countering misinformation with facts and science"".Addressing concerns in some quarters over a possible expansion of mining activities in the Aravalli Hills and Ranges following the adoption of a uniform definition, Bhupender Yadav on Sunday said it was incorrect to conclude that mining would be permitted on all landforms below 100 metres in the Aravallis.“Only 0.19% of the total 1.44 lakh sq km area of Aravalli can be eligible for mining. The rest of the Aravalli is protected and secure,” he posted on X.Yadav explained that the Aravali range comprises all landforms located within 500 metres of two adjoining hills with a height of 100 metres or more. All landforms falling within this 500-metre zone, regardless of their height or slope, are excluded from the grant of mining leases, he said.The minister also elaborated on the issue while responding to a media query on the sidelines of a meeting of the National Tiger Conservation Authority at the Sundarbans, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The query related to the Supreme Court of India’s recent acceptance of a uniform, policy-level definition of the Aravali Hills and Ranges, particularly with respect to regulating mining.Following the apex court’s acceptance that any landform located in the Aravali districts with an elevation of 100 metres or more from the local relief would be classified as Aravali Hills, some stakeholders expressed apprehension that the move could open more than 90% of the Aravalis to mining, as most landforms lie below the 100-metre mark.","Bhupender Yadav: ""No new mining leases will be permitted, especially in core, protected and ecologically sensitive areas, including the NCR"" Supreme Court accepted a uniform, policy-level definition of the Aravali Hills and Ranges, particularly with respect to regulating mining.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126121988,imgsize-57824,width-400,resizemode-4/quotmining-possible-only-in-019-area-process-now-stricterquot-environment-minister-bhupender-yadav-backs-new-aravalli-norms.jpg"

Expected revenue contribution by FY 2027-28: Rs 3,000 crore

GST from a single missile: Rs 8 crore. On October 18, DG BrahMos, Jaytirth R Joshi handed over the GST bill and cheque of around Rs 40 crore to the UP chief minister, symbolising revenue generation for the state.

Export pipeline: Negotiations ongoing with around dozen countries

Indigenous content in current production block: 83%, moving to 85% in 2026, which includes fully indigenous titanium castings (PTC Industries, Lucknow), solid rocket boosters, airframe (L&T, Godrej), avionics (HAL & Data Patterns), and inputs from 200+ Indian MSMEs.

The next frontier

Lucknow has witnessed many histories. Whispers of nawabs and poets, of rebellion and resilience, have seeped into its very essence. The Ganges, not far away, flowing steadily southward, is bearing witness to the birth of something unstoppable—a supersonic force that is redefining the skies, seas, and soils of a nation on the cusp of global reckoning. This is not a factory; it is a crucible. Sprawling over 200-acre canvas on the city’s outskirts, the state-of-the-art BrahMos Aerospace Integration and Testing Facility , India’s most formidable conventional deterrent—the supersonic BrahMos cruise missile—is being born, assembled, and given its wings.The journey began in 2018 when the Uttar Pradesh government offered 200 acres of prime land along the Lucknow-Kanpur highway as part of the Uttar Pradesh Defence Industrial Corridor (UPDIC). BrahMos Aerospace Private Limited (BAPL), the Indo-Russian joint venture between DRDO and Russia’s NPO Mashinostroyeniya, had outgrown its Hyderabad, Thiruvananthapuram, Pilani and Nagpur’s production and system integration units. Orders were pouring in: the Indian navy wanted more ship- and submarine-launched missiles, the air force was integrating the air-launched version on forty Su-30MKIs, the army needed extended-range land variants, and — most importantly — export enquiries were turning into hard contracts.The Philippines had already taken delivery of its first battery in 2024 under a 375 million USD deal. Indonesia, Vietnam, Malaysia, Argentina, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the UAE were in various stages of negotiation. By 2025 BrahMos Aerospace had firm orders for over 800 missiles in the next five years. Existing facilities simply could not cope.So, Lucknow happened.Built at a cost of around Rs 380 crore, the new campus is a city within a city: massive integration halls, a booster production block, a warhead mating facility, long high-speed sled track for subsystem validation, and an environmentally controlled pre-dispatch inspection bay that looks more like a spacecraft cleanroom than a weapons factory.Every variant of the BrahMos family — from the original 290 km land and ship versions to the 600 km extended-range and the lighter BrahMos-NG under development — will roll out from here.This year on May 11, defence minister Rajnath Singh virtually inaugurated the facility, the crown jewel of the Uttar Pradesh Defence Industrial Corridor (UPDIC), was conceived with a singular, powerful objective: to become the epicentre for meeting the soaring domestic and international demand for the BrahMos weapon system.“The state-of-the-art BrahMos Integration and Testing facility in Lucknow has been set up to cater to the growing demand for BrahMos weapon systems in the domestic and international markets. Its strategic location, a logistical advantage with seamless access to national freight corridors, ensures that the fury assembled here can be dispatched with efficiency to any frontier,” said an official source.On October 18, the defence minister in presence of chief minister Uttar Pradesh Yogi Adityanath , department of defence R&D and chairman DRDO Samir V Kamat, and DG BrahMos Jaytirth R Joshi, flagged off the first batch of missiles to the Indian Armed Forces, sleek and lethal in their transporter canisters, it marked a paradigm shift. For decades, defence manufacturing was perceived as the preserve of coastal or traditional industrial hubs. Lucknow’s roar announced a new geography of power.Built at an estimated cost of Rs 380 crore, the campus is described as a “city within a city,” designed for end-to-end integration and quality validation. Key components mentioned include:The aim: produce and support multiple BrahMos variants—from legacy 290 km versions to extended-range and the under-development BrahMos-NG.BrahMos Aerospace employs around 300-500 people directly at the Lucknow unit today, but the ripple effect is staggering.A senior BrahMos official explained: “A missile is an extremely complex system that draws on diverse industries, advanced materials, chemicals, rubber, electronics, mechanical subsystems, precision machining, welding, and more. Today, BrahMos works with over 200 private and public-sector industry partners across India who supply components, sub-assemblies, off-the-shelf items, and specialised fixtures to build the complete weapon system. """"With demand rising sharply, both from the Indian armed forces and export orders, we need to significantly diversify and expand our supply chain. The new Lucknow facility, located at the heart of the Uttar Pradesh Defence Corridor, offers the ideal platform to onboard many more MSMEs and manufacturers in the region. Proximity will enable tighter project monitoring, faster iteration, and even higher quality standards,"" added the officialThe official added that the company is actively scouting new vendors in and around Lucknow to support production targetsFurther, the human capital powering this enterprise is as meticulously curated as the technology. BrahMos Aerospace, as a world-class defence entity, adheres to a creed of pure meritocracy.“We recruit highly skilled professionals involved in designing a very high-end weapon system. We adhere to the same standards for Lucknow,” stated the official source. There is no quota for locality; excellence is the only passport.For a young engineer dreaming of contributing to missile technology, the path is clear and demanding.A stellar academic foundation in aerospace, mechanical, electronics, or computer science is the entry ticket. The recruitment funnel—through national vacancies and elite campus placements—involves rigorous technical assessments, multiple interview rounds, and stringent security clearances. The promise of “huge employment opportunities” is real, but they are opportunities earned in the most competitive arena.At present, the Lucknow facility will roll out the existing BrahMos missile to meet increased demand, but its specific purpose is to manufacture the BrahMos NG missile—NG stands for next generation. The BrahMos NG will have a 300 km range, equal to the current missile, but will be significantly lighter, at 1.2 tonnes (1,200 kilograms) compared to the existing model’s 2,900 kilograms.The new BrahMos NG would be integrated on Sukhoi 30. Currently, the Su 30 can integrate only one missile, but with the NG version, five missiles can be integrated: four on Light Combat Aircraft. On land and ship versions, instead of three missiles, six or eight can be packed, thanks to the reduced size. This approach aims to maintain effectiveness while increasing numbers and reducing costs, ensuring steady supply to the armed forces. The Lucknow facility will be its birthplace.An official source summed it up: “The BrahMos Integration and Testing Facility is an ultra-modern manufacturing unit designed for the production, assembly, and integration of all BrahMos variants, including the advanced air-launched version. It will also serve as the hub for the next-generation BrahMos in the foreseeable future.”","BrahMos Aerospace Private Limited (BAPL) had outgrown its Hyderabad, Thiruvananthapuram, Pilani and Nagpur’s production and system integration units.

"Electoral bonds scrapped by SC, trusts now swell BJP coffers",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/electoral-bonds-scrapped-by-sc-trusts-now-swell-bjp-coffers/articleshow/126108961.cms,"Vaping, Bhow-Bhow & Shouting Match: A Look At Viral Moments Of Parl As Chaotic Winter Session Ends

NEW DELHI: Rather than having an adverse impact on BJP's coffers, scrapping of electoral bonds in Feb 2024 ended up boosting its donations kitty in 2024-25, with electoral trusts alone disbursing over Rs 3,577 crore to the party.In 2023-24, BJP's total receipts through voluntary contributions had stood at Rs 3,967 crore, of which Rs 1,686 crore came via bonds and Rs 856 crore through trusts. With electoral bonds scrapped, corporate donors still seeking partial anonymity - as regards party-wise break-up of their contributions - appear to have settled for the electoral trust (ET) route while retaining BJP as the top beneficiary.The party in office at the Centre cornered 83.6% of the nearly Rs 4,276 crore contributions routed through electorate trusts, according to data on the EC website. Compared to 2023-24, this marks an over four-fold rise in corporate donations to BJP through this route. Congress accounted for 7.3% and Trinamool Congress for 3.6% of contributions made through the ET route.The donations via electoral trusts are only a part of total contributions received by parties. The other sources include individuals, corporates, institutions and welfare bodies donating directly. Over the past years, the volume of non-trust donations has consistently exceeded that from contributions via trusts.Of the Rs 3,577.5 crore contribution receipts of BJP in 2024-25 though trusts, Rs 2,180.7 crore was disbursed by Prudent Electoral Trust (ET), Rs 757.6 crore by Progressive ET, Rs 460 crore by A B General ET, Rs 150 crore by New Democratic ET, Rs 30.1 crore by Harmony ET, Rs 21 crore by Triumph ET, Rs 5 crore by Jaybharath ET, Rs 3 crore by Samaj ET, Rs 9.5 lakh by Jankalyan ET and Rs 7.75 lakh by Einzigartig ET.Congress received Rs 216.3 crore from Prudent in 2024-25, Rs 77.3 crore from Progressive, Rs 15 crore from AB General ET, Rs 5 crore from New Democratic ET and Rs 9.5 lakh from Jan Kalyan ET. Thus, the grand old party received over Rs 313 crore of its total 517 crore contributions in 2024-25 via the trust route.Prudent maintained its position as the top trust donor to political parties, having disbursed a total of Rs 2,668 crore to 15 parties in the last financial year. The Tata Group-linked Progressive ET was a distant second with its total contributions at Rs 915 crore in 2024-25, of which Rs 757 crore went to BJP, Rs 77 crore to Congress and Rs 10 crore to eight other parties.Prudent's Rs 2,668 crore kitty was distributed among BJP (Rs 2,180.7 crore); Congress (Rs 216.3 crore); Trinamool Congress (Rs 92 crore); YSR Congress Party (Rs 88 crore); TDP (Rs 40 crore); AAP (Rs 16.4 crore); Bharath Dharma Jana Sena (Rs 10 crore); BRS, JDU, BJD and AJSU (Rs 5 crore each); Sikkim Democratic Front (Rs 2.5 crore); LJP and NCP (Rs 1 crore each); and Praja Shanthi Party (Rs 50 lakh).A B General ET made Rs 460 crore worth of corporate donations to BJP and Rs 15 crore to Congress. The Mahindra Group-backed New Democratic ET gave Rs 150 crore of its total Rs 160 crore contributions to BJP, with Congress and Shiv Sena-UBT receiving Rs 5 crore each. Triumph disbursed Rs 21 crore to BJP and Rs 4 crore to Telugu Desam Party. Harmony ET contributed Rs 30.1 crore to BJP, Rs 3 crore to Shiv Sena-UBT and Rs 2 crore to NCP-Sharad Pawar. Jan Pragati Electoral Trust disbursed Rs 1 crore to Shiv Sena.Congress's receipts in 2024-25 fell way short of the Rs 828 crore it had received via bonds in 2023-24 but were higher than its Rs 171 crore bond income in 2022-23, a non-general election year. Similarly, TMC's Rs 184.5 crore receipts in 2024-25, of which Rs 153.5 crore were through trusts, were no match for its Rs 612 crore receipts via bonds in 2023-24. BJD, which received Rs 245.5 crore in bonds in 2023-24, received Rs 60 crore in donations, including Rs 35 crore via trusts, in 2024-25. BRS not only saw its Rs 495 crore receipts in bonds (2023-24) eroded, but also its receipts from trusts, which dipped to Rs 15 crore from Rs 85 crore in 2023-24.","In 2023-24, BJP's total receipts through voluntary contributions had stood at Rs 3,967 crore, of which Rs 1,686 crore came via bonds and Rs 856 crore through trusts.

Bhupender Yadav on new Aravalli 'definition'

The road ahead

If demography can be a dividend, geography certainly decides its destiny. Few landscapes illustrate this more clearly than the Aravalli Range, an ancient chain of hills that quietly shapes water security, climate, and life across western and northwestern India.The hills that run for nearly 690 km from Gujarat through Rajasthan and Haryana to Delhi, forming the oldest fold mountain system in the subcontinent, have become the center of a long-running environmental and legal debate.At the heart of the issue is a simple but emotive question. What exactly counts as the Aravalli range? The answer matters because this classification determines which areas can be mined, built upon, or conserved.A recent ruling by the Supreme Court has accepted a ""standard definition"" proposed by the central government to identify what qualifies as the Aravalli Hills. While the move was intended to bring clarity to long-standing disputes, the definition’s limited ecological lens has raised fresh concerns about environmental protection and sustainable development.In November, the Supreme Court agreed with a proposal by the central government on how the Aravalli hills should be officially identified.The court said that only those hills that rise at least 100 metres above the surrounding land, or groups of such hills located close to each other, will be considered part of the Aravalli range for regulatory purposes.The court also asked the Union government to carefully map the region and prepare a clear plan for managing it. This plan will include rules on where mining can take place and how it should be regulated. The aim is to remove confusion caused by different government records and maps, which have often led to disputes and court cases in the past.Environmental experts maintain the significance of the Aravalli hills is not about how tall they are, but about what they do.The hills work like a natural water storage system, with their rocky structure allowing rainwater to slowly seep underground and refill aquifers. These aquifers supply water to many towns in Rajasthan and big cities such as Delhi, Gurugram, Faridabad, and Alwar. Studies even show that large-scale mining and cutting of hills damage this process, leading to long-term loss of groundwater.The Aravallis also help slow the spread of the Thar Desert towards eastern India. Scientists warn that if the hills continue to be damaged, desertification could increase, along with dust storms and extreme heat in the Indo-Gangetic plains.Although the region is dry, the Aravalli hills support forests, scrubland and grasslands. These habitats are home to wildlife such as leopards, hyenas, nilgai and many bird species. Conservationists say these ecosystems are fragile and can be easily broken apart by mining and construction.The current controversy is primarily rooted in decades of judicial scrutiny. Since the 1980s, courts have intervened repeatedly to curb unregulated mining in the Aravalli belt, particularly in Rajasthan and Haryana.Multiple Supreme Court orders in the 1990s and early 2000s restricted mining in notified forest areas, citing environmental degradation, air pollution and public health risks. However, enforcement remained weak due to the absence of a universally accepted definition of what constituted the Aravalli range.Mining operators and developers often argued that certain hillocks or plateaus did not legally qualify as Aravallis, even if they were ecologically linked to the system. This ambiguity reportedly created administrative paralysis and prolonged litigation, prompting the Centre to seek a standardised definition.Government officials and legal experts defending the Supreme Court’s ruling argue that the elevation-based criterion introduces clarity into a highly subjective domain. They say that by setting a measurable threshold, authorities can avoid arbitrary decisions and reduce disputes over land classification.In its observation, the top court acknowledged the need to balance environmental protection with economic realities. Mining of stone and minerals in the Aravalli region supports livelihoods and supplies essential materials for construction and infrastructure. A blanket ban, the SC noted, could have severe economic consequences if not backed by clear scientific and legal parameters.The ruling has drawn criticism from ecologists, hydrologists, and civil society groups who believe that the 100-meter threshold oversimplifies a complex landscape like the Aravalli.They point out that many ecologically critical features of the Aravalli system, including recharge zones, wildlife corridors and low-lying ridges, do not meet the elevation criterion but are vital to the range’s environmental function. Excluding these areas from automatic protection, critics say, could open the door to expanded mining and construction.Experts also warn that mining impacts are cumulative, as even shallow or small-scale extraction can permanently alter drainage patterns and soil stability, consequently reducing the land’s ability to absorb rainfall. In arid and semi-arid regions, such damage is often irreversible.Once this order is implemented in full force, which is for mining purposes, environmentalist Vimlendu Jha said, ""tomorrow it could be real estate or other things that could begin in the region, which is also the main fear of the locals of the entire region.""Disagreeing with the new definition of Aravalli, Jha said, ""the mountain is not just a piece of rock assembled together. Aravalli, which is the oldest mountain range in the world, is also an ecosystem."" He said, ""If mining is allowed...Aravalli, which is above the ground, is also under the ground. So it's not just the tree cover, green cover, or the national dust shield or weather shield it provides, but at the end of the day, temperature and air quality between Thar and Delhi are maintained because of the shield of the Aravalli. ""Shedding light on the risk arising from the new definition that ""lifts the protection,"" he said, risk is that all of this will be a large-scale plundering of this area and not just by mining, but also by other areas like real estate.""Once we start calling it a forest and not a range, and it falls under a semi-urban landscape or rural landscape rather than a protected landscape, it will be open for any kind of exploitation through economic-commercial activity,"" he told TOI.Talking about the impact on the Delhi-NCR region, which witnesses toxic-air-driven health hazards every year, Jha said, ""Firstly, desertification increases when we compromise with the buffer we have. Secondly, when the dust increases, the PM10 level we have in the Delhi-NCR is pathetic and therefore the risk or the intensity of air quality increases. Aravalli's entire area is also the main water recharge table, so the water sufficiency of the region is also questioned because of mining. ""Magasaysay awardee Rajendra Singh, known as the ""Waterman of India,"" said earlier governments and courts took nature and environmental issues seriously, but that approach has disappeared.""If this decision, meant to benefit one individual, is implemented, only 7-8 per cent of the Aravalli will survive,"" he told news agency PTI, calling for a legal battle as well as mass public mobilisation.Amid concerns in some quarters over a possible expansion of mining activities in the Aravalli Hills and Ranges following the adoption of a uniform definition, Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav on Sunday said it was incorrect to conclude that mining would be permitted on all landforms below 100 metres in the Aravallis.“Only 0.19% of the total 1.44 lakh sq km area of Aravalli can be eligible for mining. The rest of the Aravalli is protected and secure,” he posted on X.Yadav explained that the Aravali range comprises all landforms located within 500 metres of two adjoining hills with a height of 100 metres or more. All landforms falling within this 500-metre zone, regardless of their height or slope, are excluded from the grant of mining leases, he said.The minister also elaborated on the issue while responding to a media query on the sidelines of a meeting of the National Tiger Conservation Authority at the Sundarbans, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The query related to the Supreme Court of India’s recent acceptance of a uniform, policy-level definition of the Aravali Hills and Ranges, particularly with respect to regulating mining.Following the apex court’s acceptance that any landform located in the Aravali districts with an elevation of 100 metres or more from the local relief would be classified as Aravali Hills, some stakeholders expressed apprehension that the move could open more than 90% of the Aravalis to mining, as most landforms lie below the 100-metre mark.Yadav, however, stressed that all landforms enclosed within the lowest binding contour encircling hills of 100 metres or more, irrespective of their height or slope, are excluded from the grant of mining leases.The Supreme Court’s directive to conduct scientific mapping is now seen as the critical next step. Environmental lawyers say the outcome will depend on how comprehensively the mapping exercise incorporates hydrology, biodiversity and geomorphology, rather than focusing solely on elevation. Transparency will also be key.Civil society groups have demanded that maps and management plans be made public and subjected to independent scientific review. Without such safeguards, they argue, the process risks becoming a procedural formality rather than a tool for genuine conservation.At its core, the Aravalli debate reflects a broader challenge in India’s environmental governance. How to reconcile development pressures with the protection of natural systems that do not conform neatly to administrative boundaries or numerical thresholds.As climate stress intensifies and water scarcity deepens across north-west India, the fate of the Aravalli range carries implications far beyond the hills themselves. Whether the Supreme Court’s attempt at regulatory clarity strengthens or weakens environmental protection will depend on how the ruling is implemented on the ground, which ultimately remains at the mercy of bureaucracy.For now, India’s oldest mountain range stands at a crossroads, its fate being debated and defined by modern institutions that are only a moment in time compared to the ancient geology they now seek to regulate.","The Aravalli Range is an ancient chain of hills that quietly shapes water security, climate, and life across western and northwestern India.

NEW DELHI: Amid concerns expressed in certain quarters over the possibility of expansion of mining activities in the Aravali Hills and Ranges in the wake of its new uniform definition, Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav on Sunday said it was absolutely wrong to conclude that the mining is permitted in all landforms below 100 metres height as there has been no relaxation made at all in the Aravali.“Only 0.19% of the total 1.44 lakh sq km area of Aravali can be eligible for mining. The rest of the Aravali is protected and secure,” he posted on X.The Aravalli Hills and Ranges are among India’s oldest geological formations, stretching from Delhi through Haryana, Rajasthan, and into Gujarat. Only a very small area is under permitted mining leases and out of this small percentage, nearly 90 % of the mining activity is confined to Rajasthan, followed by about 9% in Gujarat and about 1% in Haryana. No mining activity is permitted in Delhi.Yaav said the Aravali range has been explained as all the landforms which exist within 500 metre of two adjoining hills of height of 100 metres or more. All landforms existing within this 500 metre zone irrespective of their height and slopes are excluded for the purposes of grant of mining lease, said the minister.He also clarified the issue in detail in response to a media query on the sidelines of the National Tiger Conservation Authority’s meeting at Unesco World Heritage Site Sundarbans.The question pertained to the recent Supreme Court's acceptance of uniform policy level definition of Aravali Hills and Ranges specifically in the context of regulating mining.Yadav, however, emphasised that all the landforms enclosed within the lowest binding contour encircling Hills of height 100 metre or more irrespective of their height and slopes are excluded for the purposes of grant of mining lease.The Opposition parties had raised the issue in the Parliament during the concluded winter session, claiming that the definition would exclude most of the Aravali range from protection. In the wake of the SC's Nov order of accepting the Centre-backed definition, Congress general secretary and former environment minister Jairam Ramesh called the move a severe blow to the Aravali ecosystem.""The Aravalli Hills extend from Delhi through Haryana and Rajasthan to Gujarat. Over the years they have been devastated by mining, construction, and other activities in violation of all regulations and laws. Now it appears that this sensitive and sprawling ecosystem will be subject to another severe blow,"" Ramesh had posted on X.Referring to media reports, he had said, ""This definition is meant to restrict mining but in reality will mean that 90% of the Aravalli Hills will not be counted as Aravalli any more. Evidently, the Supreme Court has accepted this revised definition. This is bizarre and will have very grave environmental and public health consequences. It calls for an immediate review.""Former Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot too opened a front against the SC recent move, blaming the Centre for pitching for that uniform definition. Yadav on Sunday, however, appealed to everyone to ""stop spreading confusion"" and even explained how the Rajasthan government has been following the definition since 2006.His ministry also explained that all Aravali range states/UT during deliberations agreed to adopt the uniform criterion of “100 metres above local relief” for regulating mining in the Aravalli region as had been in force in Rajasthan while unanimously agreeing to make it more objective and transparent.""All the landforms enclosed within the lowest binding contour encircling Hills of height 100 metre or more irrespective of their height and slopes are excluded for the purposes of grant of mining lease. Similarly, Aravali range has been explained as all the landforms which exist within 500 metres of two adjoining Hills of height 100 metre or more. All landforms existing within this 500 metre zone irrespective of their height and slopes are excluded for the purposes of grant of mining lease,"" the ministry clarified.By defining Aravalli Hills as any landform rising 100 metres or more above local relief, along with their supporting slopes, the entire ecological unit is protected. This prevents piecemeal exploitation of slopes or foothills that are vital for soil stability, water recharge, and vegetation cover.""","The Aravalli Hills and Ranges are among India’s oldest geological formations, stretching from Delhi through Haryana, Rajasthan, and into Gujarat. Only a very small area is under permitted mining leases and out of this small percentage, nearly 90 % of the mining activity is confined to Rajasthin.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126106665,imgsize-1036421,width-400,resizemode-4/pic-62.jpg"

"India closer to $450m BrahMos pacts with Vietnam, Indonesia",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-closer-to-450m-brahmos-pacts-with-vietnam-indonesia/articleshow/126131232.cms,".

NEW DELHI: India has moved closer to inking deals to export BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles to Vietnam and Indonesia, which collectively will be worth over Rs 4,000 crore ($450 million).Russia, the joint developer of BrahMos missiles that fly at almost three times the speed of sound (Mach 2.8), has assured India that it has no objection to the precision-strike weapon being sold to Vietnam and Indonesia, defence sources said.With the assurance being given during the delegation-level meeting between defence minister Rajnath Singh and his Russian counterpart Andrei Belousov on Dec 4, a formal no-objection certificate is now awaited from Moscow. “Both Vietnam and Indonesia, after agreeing to the initial deals, may go for more orders in the future,” a source said.Once the deals are inked, Vietnam and Indonesia will become the other Asean countries after the Philippines to buy the air-breathing missiles. India had inked a $375 million contract to supply three anti-ship BrahMos coastal batteries to the Philippines in Jan 2022. “Manila, too, is likely to order more BrahMos missiles,” the source said.All three countries, incidentally, have major concerns over China’s strong-arm tactics and expansionism in the South China Sea, with confrontations escalating, especially between Manila and Beijing, over the last couple of years.India, on its part, had successfully deployed the BrahMos missiles, whose range has been increased to 450 km from the original 290 km, from Sukhoi-30MKI fighter jets for targeted strikes deep into Pakistan during Operation Sindoor in May.Over the years, Indian armed forces have inked deals worth around Rs 60,000 crore with Indo-Russian joint venture BrahMos Aerospace, with the missiles becoming the prime conventional (non-nuclear) precision-strike weapons for IAF, Navy and Army.India also plans to begin inducting the new 800-km BrahMos from 2028 onwards, with tests currently underway for the extended-range missiles with a modified ramjet engine and other upgrades, as was earlier reported by TOI.Apart from Brahmos missiles, India wants to sell the indigenous Akash air defence missile systems, which can intercept hostile aircraft, helicopters, drones and subsonic cruise missiles at a 25-km range, and Pinaka multi-launch rocket systems to the Philippines, Indonesia and Vietnam as well as other “friendly countries” like the UAE and Brazil.While India is still in the strategically vulnerable position of being among the top three arms importers in the world, it exported a wide range of arms, ammunition, defence sub-systems and components, worth nearly Rs 24,000 crore, to around 80 countries in the 2024-25 fiscal.In this, Armenia is one of India’s biggest clients of ‘finished’ weapon systems like Akash air defence missile systems, Pinaka rocket systems and 155mm artillery guns, as was reported by TOI earlier.",Vietnam and Indonesia will become the other Asean countries after the Philippines to buy the air-breathing missiles.

NEW DELHI: The India-New Zealand FTA ran into some political opposition in Wellington as the right-wing New Zealand First (NZF), a member of the ruling coalition, opposed the deal, calling it neither free nor fair. NZF leader Winston Peters, who is also the foreign minister of New Zealand, said his party would vote against the enabling legislation as and when it's introduced.""Regrettably, this is a bad deal for New Zealand. It gives too much away, especially on immigration, and does not get enough in return for New Zealanders, including on dairy,"" said Peters.However, the opposition Labour Party was reported to have indicated support for the legislation when it's introduced in Parliament. According to Peters, while New Zealand is completely opening its market to Indian products under the deal, India is not reducing the significant tariff barriers currently in place for New Zealand's major dairy products. ""The India FTA would be New Zealand's first trade deal to exclude our major dairy products -- including milk, cheese and butter. In the year to Nov 2025, New Zealand exports of these products were worth around $24 billion, or 30% of our total goods exports,"" said the minister.","The India-New Zealand FTA ran into some political opposition in Wellington.

NEW DELHI: The conclusion of the India-New Zealand free trade agreement (FTA) in record nine months will serve as a catalyst for greater trade, investment, innovation and shared opportunities between both countries, PM Narendra Modi and his counterpart Christopher Luxon said after jointly announcing the conclusion of talks.“The FTA would significantly deepen bilateral economic engagement, enhance market access, promote investment flows, strengthen strategic cooperation between the two countries and also open up new opportunities for innovators, entrepreneurs, farmers, MSMEs, students and youth of both countries across various sectors,” said an official statement.With the strong and credible foundation provided by the FTA, both leaders expressed confidence in doubling bilateral trade over the next five years as well as an investment of $20 billion in India from New Zealand over the next 15 years, it added. The leaders also welcomed the progress achieved in other areas of bilateral cooperation, such as sports, education and people-to-people ties, and reaffirmed their commitment to strengthening further the India-New Zealand partnership.“India–New Zealand FTA, that brings in $20 billion investment and offers lucrative opportunities for Indian innovators, entrepreneurs, farmers, MSMEs, students and youth will open new gateways to prosperity.

Passport deposit as bail clause needs proof of flight risk: High court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/passport-deposit-as-bail-clause-needs-proof-of-flight-risk-high-court/articleshow/126130930.cms,".

CHANDIGARH: Punjab and Haryana high court has ruled that the authority vested in a criminal court to impose the condition of ‘deposit of passport’ ought not to be exercised in a “rote or automatic manner”, and such bail conditions must not unduly curtail personal liberty.HC was of the view that the condition for depositing one’s passport must be supported by specific material that points to a genuine flight risk. “It must be acknowledged that passport is not merely a travel document, but is often used as proof of nationality and identity. An order of deposit of passport as a pre-condition for bail is justifiable only on the basis of objective factors indicating a clear and imminent threat to the administration of justice, and must not be employed as a punitive measure against an undertrial accused, who is presumed innocent until proven guilty,” the bench of Justice Sumeet Goel held while deciding a criminal revision petition filed by Ram Lubhaya and others, who challenged a Nov 22, 2019, order of the additional sessions judge, Jalandhar. . HC was also of the view that it is not desirable to lay down any “straitjacket formulation” in this regard. To do so would be to crystallise into a rigid definition a judicial discretion, which even the legitimate has, for the best of all reasons, left undetermined.“Any attempt in this regard would be, to say the least, a quixotic endeavour. Circumstantial flexibility, one additional or different fact, may make a sea of difference between conclusions in two cases.Such exercise would thus, indubitably, be dependent upon the factual matrix of the particular case which the court is seisin of, since every case has its own peculiar factual conspectus. Such judicial discretion, but of course, ought to be exercised in accordance with the principles of justice, equity, and good conscience,” the court held.While the Jalandhar sessions court had granted anticipatory bail to the petitioners in a criminal case, involving charges of causing hurt and wrongful confinement, it directed them to deposit their passports before the trial magistrate. In their plea before HC, the petitioners argued that they were summoned only for comparatively less severe offences and there was no material on record to show they were a flight risk. “The condition was arbitrary, excessive, and imposed without justification. Passports are essential identity and travel documents, and their seizure caused undue hardship,” the petitioners argued.After hearing the matter, HC set aside the condition requiring the petitioners to deposit their passports, holding it to be unsupported by facts.","HC was of the view that the condition for depositing one’s passport must be supported by specific material that points to a genuine flight risk. “An order of deposit of passport as a pre-condition for bail is justifiable only on the basis of objective factors indicating a clear and imminent threat to the administration of justice,” the court held.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126130994,imgsize-729270,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

New Delhi: Delhi high court Monday sought responses from Congress MPs Sonia Gandhi Rahul Gandhi and other accused on an ED plea challenging a trial court order that refused to take cognisance of the agency's charge-sheet in the National Herald money laundering case, while declining to grant any immediate stay.Justice Ravinder Dudeja issued notice on ED's petition and on a connected application seeking a stay of the Dec 16 order, listing the matter for a detailed hearing on March 12, 2026.The trial court had held that cognisance of ED's complaint was ""impermissible in law"" because the probe was not founded on a FIR under Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), but arose from a private complaint.The case centres on alleged misuse of funds and transfer of control of Associated Journals Ltd - publisher of National Herald - to Young Indian, a private company tied to Congress functionaries. ED has accused the Gandhis, Congress functionaries Motilal Vora, Oscar Fernandes, Suman Dubey, Sam Pitroda and Young Indian of conspiracy and money laundering.Appearing for ED, solicitor general Tushar Mehta said the trial court failed to appreciate that the PMLAprobe rested on scheduled offences of cheating and criminal conspiracy under IPC, of which cognisance had already been taken by a magistrate and upheld through Supreme Court.That placed the case on a firmer legal footing than a police FIR, he said.Mehta contended that cognisance taken by a competent court on a private complaint carried a higher legal standing than an FIR, where cognisance could still be declined even after a charge-sheet. He said PMLA does not prescribe how a scheduled offence must be registered, requiring only the existence of allegations of criminal activity relating to such offences, not that they necessarily arise from an FIR.During the hearing, the court asked whether cognisance of the private complaint was taken after examination of the complainant. Mehta replied in the affirmative and said witnesses had also been examined.Senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, appearing for the Gandhis, opposed any interim relief. ""There is a perspective, contrary to what my friend has said,"" he submitted, as the court proceeded to issue notice without granting a stay.The trial court had ruled that investigation and filing of a charge-sheet for money laundering were ""not maintainable"" without an FIR under PMLA, stressing that ED's action flowed from a private complaint. Having declined cognisance on a question of law, it said other arguments on merits need not be examined.The court also recorded that despite receiving a complaint from BJP's Subramanian Swamy and a summoning order in 2014, CBI did not register an FIR for the alleged scheduled offences.","The case centres on alleged misuse of funds and transfer of control of Associated Journals Ltd - publisher of National Herald.

"G RAM G not demolition of MGNREGA, says BJP",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/g-ram-g-not-demolition-of-mgnrega-says-bjp/articleshow/126128763.cms,"Image: IANS

NEW DELHI: BJP on Monday dismissed Sonia Gandhi's criticism of MGNREGA's rollback as a flight of her ""political fancy"", asserting that the VB-G RAM G law is not a demolition of the UPA-era Act but a repair job aimed at renewal and expansion of social protection in an India in the throes of change.BJP's IT department head Amit Malviya said, ""This is not demolition - it is overdue repair. The real choice is not between compassion and reform, but between paper guarantees that under-deliver and a modern framework that actually works. VB-G RAM G is not a retreat from social protection; it is its renewal and expansion for a changing India.""Malviya's statement came after the Congress leader said that the ""demolition"" of Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act will have catastrophic consequences for crores of people across rural India and called upon all to unite and safeguard the rights meant to protect everyone.He accused her of mischaracterisation and uttering outright falsehoods, claiming that MGNREGA was not a result of wide consultations as she had said but was conceived by National Advisory Council, which was headed by her and functioned like a super cabinet.Rebutting her arguments, he said the legal right to employment remains untouched, though with a changed budgeting framework. From being open-ended and reactive, it is now a norm-based system like all govt schemes.Far from weakening the job guarantee, guaranteed employment has been strengthened from 100 days to 125 days, he added.The new law will not suppress rural wage growth, he said, holding that the criticism ignores the changes rural India has witnessed. ""While MGNREGA did play a role in alleviating distress, it has not kept pace with today's rural realities. NABARD and MPCE data show that 80% of rural households report higher consumption, 42.2% report higher incomes and 58.3% now rely exclusively on formal credit. MGNREGA today functions as a fallback safety net, not as the defining feature of rural livelihoods. ""Taking on the charge that Centre is shifting the financial burden to states by moving from a 90:10 expenditure model to 60:40 one, Malviya said MGNREGA was never funded to the extent of 90% by Centre in practice as states already bore 25% of material costs, major administrative expenses and 100% of unemployment allowance, often without predictability or transparency.""The new model simply formalises and rationalises funding, making states equal partners rather than passive implementers of top-down mandates,"" he said.","BJP's IT department head Amit Malviya said, ""This is not demolition - it is overdue repair"" The legal right to employment remains untouched, though with a changed budgeting framework.

NEW DELHI: Environment minister Manjinder Singh Sirsa has said that over 10,000 vehicles have failed emission tests since the implementation of GRAP-4 and over 2 lakh have been issued Pollution Under Control (PUC) certificates.He added that govt is also upgrading all PUC centres with high-capacity equipment to reduce delays and ensure accurate emission testing.Additionally, a third-party inspection mechanism will be introduced to strengthen credibility and transparency in certification.He said the 2 lakh vehicles got the PUC tests done after the ""No PUC, No Fuel"" rule came into effect. Nearly 10,000 vehicles that were tested failed to meet the standards. ""This clearly indicates that the enforcement measures are being implemented seriously and are yielding results,"" Sirsa added.According to experts, the current on-road vehicle inspection programme is weak and based on simple idle testing of CO and hydrocarbons (HC) at two speed idle tests, along with Lambda test for petrol vehicles and smoke density test for diesel vehicles.Researchers at DTU had earlier rolled out an AQI-type PUC certificate system that considered the mileage of vehicles too when testing for emissions.They referred to older studies published with the Atmospheric Pollution Research and American Society of Civil Engineers (ACSE), and suggested inspections and maintenance, along with mileage, as important factors that should be incorporated in PUC tests.Dr Rajeev Kumar Mishra, associate professor at the department of environmental science and engineering at DTU, said the testing now and recertification for in-use cars should include fast idle conditions as well as mass emission testing. The PUC certificate is given just based on the CO and hydrocarbon emissions when the car is in the idle state, meaning the engine is not revving, he said. Emissions such as NO2, PM2.5 and VOC at the fast idling stage at 2500 rpm are sometimes recorded, but these are not considered during certification, he pointed out.""Identifying which vehicles should be phased out or issued PUC certificates should be based on the accumulated mileage, maintenance records, and performance according to both emission norms, not just by age,"" Mishra said. There are no standards from BS-6, and every vehicle is tested based on its built type, he added.According to a study by CSE, vehicle emissions are one of Delhi's major source of air pollution and have a direct impact on human health. While PUC checks may keep the highly polluting vehicles off the road, it still doesn't address the harmful emissions such as PM2.5 and other toxic gases.""Various studies on source apportionment and emission inventory have shown that vehicles are the second largest contributor of particulate emissions. Vehicles are responsible for highly toxic exposures as the emissions happen at the breathing height,"" said Shambhavi Shukla, programme manager on air pollution at the Centre for Science and Environment. She suggested more updated vehicle emission surveillance systems, such as remote sensing mechanisms.She pointed to another layer of problems in PUC certification — the centres themselves. ""CSE and EPCA conducted an audit in 2017 of PUC system in Delhi-NCR. They found that at many places, certificates were issued without putting the probe into the tailpipe. In NCR, there were centres that had only printers, not even a monitor. There were instances when different centres showed varying results. PUC staff should have a compulsory ITI certificate but that was not the case,"" she said.","Environment minister Manjinder Singh Sirsa has said that over 10,000 vehicles have failed emission tests since the implementation of GRAP-4. He added that govt is also upgrading all PUC centres with high-capacity equipment to reduce delays and ensure accurate emission testing.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126131450,imgsize-19144,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/delhi-pollution.jpg"

Delhi’s Air Pollution Gets Attention, But Most Indian Cities Are As Bad Or Worse | I Witness

NEW DELHI: Dense smog continued to choke the national capital on Tuesday morning, sharply reducing visibility and keeping air quality firmly in the ‘severe’ range. The Air Quality Index (AQI) Delhi stood at 414 around 7 am, according to data from Sameer app.Several parts of Delhi recorded alarmingly high pollution levels. Key hotspots included Anand Vihar (466), Mundka (451), Ashok Vihar (444) and the ITO area (436), all falling in the ‘severe’ category.Prominent landmarks such as India Gate, Kartavya Path and Rashtrapati Bhavan were engulfed in thick toxic smog, with AQI readings crossing 400.Air quality across the wider National Capital Region (NCR) also remained grim. Noida recorded an AQI of 426, while Ghaziabad stood at 415, both categorised as ‘severe', underscoring the spread of the pollution episode beyond Delhi.According to news agency PTI, flight and rail operations were hit as dense fog blanketed the city. On Monday, more than 500 flights were delayed and at least 14 flights were cancelled at the Indira Gandhi International Airport due to poor visibility and adverse weather conditions.Rail services were also disrupted, with several trains running behind schedule and a few cancelled owing to dense fog in the region, causing inconvenience to passengers.With pollution levels worsening, authorities invoked Stage IV of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP-4) to curb emissions. Truck-mounted water sprinklers were deployed across several parts of the city to suppress dust and reduce particulate matter.As per AQI norms, values between 0 and 50 are classified as ‘good’, 51–100 ‘satisfactory’, 101–200 ‘moderate’, 201–300 ‘poor’, 301–400 ‘very poor’, and 401–500 ‘severe’.Meanwhile, dense to very dense fog continued to disrupt life across the northern plains on Monday, impacting flight and rail operations.Although Delhi’s AQI showed marginal fluctuations, it remained stuck in the very poor to severe range. The lowest visibility in the city was recorded at just 150 metres at Palam during the early hours. At Indira Gandhi International Airport, more than 500 flights were delayed and 14 were cancelled, while several trains were delayed by at least 30 minutes.Weather officials said conditions may see gradual improvement as the prevailing western disturbance weakens and wind speeds pick up. Fog intensity is expected to reduce till December 26, though air quality is likely to remain very poor. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has not issued any colour-coded alerts till December 28, forecasting shallow to moderate fog and surface winds of up to 20 kmph during the day.Meteorologists cautioned that another weak western disturbance between December 28 and 31 could bring calmer winds and a fresh spell of dense fog. “Wind speeds are expected to gradually increase as the current western disturbance weakens. Cold northwesterly winds will dominate, reducing fog but leading to a dip in temperatures,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice president at Skymet.Delhi recorded a maximum temperature of 21.8°C on Monday, while the minimum stood at 11°C.

Shane McMahon’s WWE legacy and wealth creation

Business ventures and Marissa Mazzola-McMahon’s role

Shane McMahon and Marissa Mazzola-McMahon, who both served as WWE Producer/Director, are worth a combined $650 million, the result of decades spent near one of sports entertainment’s most influential families and a carefully curated soon-to-branch portfolio beyond the ring. Shane, as a key McMahon heir, has had his financial profile associated with WWE's ascendance to a worldwide media conglomerate for decades, while Marissa's career has been largely away from the limelight.Their fortune, collectively, is uneven but complementary at best. The vast bulk of the couples wealth originates from Shane, who owns most of the couple's cash, investments, and property, as Marissa’s professional income and personal assets serve to augment, not scale, the family nest-egg. Rumors in the financial, as well as the gossip and entertainment worlds, have put their collective net gross at around $205 million by 2025, but the numbers are tightly held secrets.Even hooks have different weights, and for Shane McMahon, his financial foundation came from WWE, where he served in various capacities as an executive, on-camera talent, and brand representative. He was in charge when WWE became a publicly traded, globally syndicating corporation, a transition that paid senior insiders in the form of salaries, bonuses and equity-linked pay.Shane also became recognized over the years for the insane, risk-taking, high impact, physical matches that elevated his brand and worth.Overall, Shane's net worth is often assumed to be around $200 million in 2025 as an individual. That number includes years of WWE and associated earnings, assets from the McMahon family estate, and WWE-affiliated corporate relationships. Although he was never as high on the control totem pole as his old man, his standing in the company meant he was around some significant cash decisions in WWE's most successful years.Shane McMahon has built up a portfolio of separate business interests away from WWE, with a particular focus on technology, media, and emerging industries. He has been chairman and advisor to a number of companies, as part of the indication that he might be looking to diversify beyond wrestling-related income. They have not always been runaway headline-grabbers, but all together they build up his overall financial footprint and his long game for the long haul.Less dramatic is the financial story of Marissa Mazzola-McMahon. She comes from a film production and corporate public relations background, and her career has been built on cash flows, not large equity windfalls. Her own net worth is frequently thought to be about $5 million. Add in Shane's holdings, and their financial empire still has deep roots in WWE legacy wealth, supported, but increasingly crucial, by business diversification.Also Read: Shane McMahon adds fuel to rumors of Vince McMahon reclaiming WWE ownership","Shane McMahon and Marissa Mazzola-McMahon, who both served as WWE Producer/Director, are worth a combined $650 million.

How Brooklyn Beckham has built his personal fortune

Nicola Peltz’s Hollywood career and billionaire family backing

Brooklyn Beckham and Nicola Peltz have become one of the hottest pairs of young celebrity couples in the planet, thanks to both their famous surnames and the rarefied (and distinct) financial universes they inhabit. Bringing together British sports and fashion royalty with an American dynasty of Hollywood and high finance, their marriage endowed a joint fortune that captivated public imagination among their fans.Brooklyn Beckham and Nicola Peltz have a combined net worth of about $60 million in 2025. While these fortunes sit next door to much larger family fortunes that continue to define their lifestyle, opportunities, and financial safety, this figure represents their earnings from creative careers that brought them to our attention in the first place.Anybody with a last name Beckham could show up and just straight-up stomp the rest of them, but Brooklyn Beckham, son of famous footballer David Beckham and fashion designer Victoria Beckham, has been working hard to build up a career apart from the famous family. Most of his income has been through modeling campaigns, commercial photography assignments, and sponsored collaborations related to fashion, food, and lifestyle brands.Although his publishing and culinary projects have elicited a more erratic response from critics, brand tie-ins and social media collaborations have been a veritable financial goldmine. We estimate Brooklyn Beckham to have a dominantly stagnant commercial but blockbuster, sparse personal net worth of $10 million by 2025.Nicola Peltz brings a different financial profile to the marriage. She also has a long history of acting in television productions and major film franchises, as well as modeling and other appearances in the fashion industry for more income. All of these put together have allowed her to acquire an estimated personal net worth of around 50 million dollars.In addition to her personal income, Nicola Peltz has the granddaddy of all sources of wealth, as she is the daughter of hedge fund mogul Nelson Peltz. While this family fortune is not technically included in her individual wealth, it bestows one access to large amounts of money, such as through luxury real estate, private investments, and elite business circles.ID@undefinedCaption not available.ID@undefinedCaption not available.Brooklyn Beckham and Nicola Peltz are the perfect modern union between a famous couple whose individual monetary pursuits are inexplicably tied to familial connections. A combined $60 million net worth certainly reflects what each of them has, but the rest of their family lines seem to continue giving them public exposure and wifely earnings power. Their account of ever-growing riches in 2025 has less to do with consolidation than it does with the merging of celebrity, family, and meticulously crafted careers.Also Read: Beckham family rift deepens: Brooklyn unfollows parents David and Victoria, spends Christmas apart","Brooklyn Beckham and Nicola Peltz have a combined net worth of about $60 million in 2025.

Elon Musk’s rapid rise: From $24 billion to the brink of trillionaire status









Elon Musk has reached a historical financial milestone, as he has become the first-ever person to ever achieve a net worth that surpasses the whopping figure of $600 billion, as reported in Forbes magazine. This milestone has been achieved during a time when there is newfound interest in his privately owned rocket company, SpaceX, which he believes will make a historical initial start detailing a whopping value of $800 billion with an initial public offering that could potentially take place in 2026.Musk's net worth has not only increased with his involvement with his rocket company, SpaceX, but he has earned a tremendous amount of money with his investment in electric cars with his company, Tesla, where his net worth has increased by a whopping 12% because of his investment in his own artificial intelligence company, xAI.As reported by Forbes, Elon Musk has now broken yet another record by being the first individual to ever reach a net worth of over $600 billion. This achievement has come at a time when his private rocket company, SpaceX, has seen a tremendous rise in market value, with plans of an initial public offering in 2026. Musk's net worth is also contributed by his stake of 12% in Tesla, an electric vehicle behemoth, and his artificial intelligence company, xAI, both of which keep increasing in value.From groundbreaking innovations in space travel and electric mobility to ambitious AI projects, futuristic ventures, and global business expansions, Musk’s diversified portfolio and relentless pursuit of technological advancement have cemented his status as the world’s richest person.SpaceX has also showcased its role in the increasing wealth of Musk to historic levels. With an estimated 42% stake in the firm, the net worth of Musk is expected to grow by an enormous $168 billion if SpaceX continues to retain its current valuation of $800 billion. Analysts also expect it to reach a valuation of $1.5 trillion when it comes to the public market and possibly become the first trillionaire in the world. The innovative nature of SpaceX in terms of its rocket and satellite launches continues to impress the market while affecting the net worth of its CEO.Tesla stock is still an integral part of Musk’s financial network. His current stake of about 12% in Tesla is valued at $197 billion without taking into consideration the stock options from the 2018 CEO Performance Award that are still winding their way through litigation. Apart from that, Tesla shareholders have just approved what is considered the largest compensation deal of $1 trillion that is pegged on meeting various performance goals, including doubling the current market capitalization eightfold in ten years.Musk’s AI company, xAI, is also a significant contributor to his net worth. In the advanced talk of raising funding worth $15 billion in fresh equity, the firm is placed at a value of $230 billion. Musk owns about 53% of the firm’s stakes under xAI Holdings, meaning he has a net worth of about $60 billion. AI is another major sector into which Musk has ventured.Musk's emergence to $600 billion in a short span of time can be noted. He started with $24.6 billion in March 2020 and broke the $100 billion mark later in the same year, and reached $190 billion in January 2021. He broke many records in the last five years with his wealth and became the first person to break $500 billion in October 2025. At present, he leads the richest people in the world by a very large margin of $425 billion over Google co-founder Larry Page and is soon to reach $700 billion.","Elon Musk has become the first person to ever achieve a net worth that surpasses the whopping figure of $600 billion.

Mumbai air pollution: HC summons BMC chief over polluting infra sites; non-compliance found at 36 sites,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-air-pollution-hc-summons-bmc-chief-over-polluting-infra-sites-non-compliance-found-at-36-sites/articleshow/126131386.cms,"MUMBAI: The Bombay High Court on Monday observed that a ground-reality report by a four-member panel prima facie indicates non-compliance with air pollution control civic guidelines at all the 36 sites surveyed. The court summoned civic chief Bhushan Gagrani and the member secretary of the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB), directing them to remain personally present at 11 am on Tuesday.“We have formed a prima-facie opinion that the Municipal Commissioner and the Member Secretary of the MPCB should personally explain the inaction on the part of the concerned officers of the MCGM and the MPCB,” said Chief Justice Shree Chandrashekhar and Justice Gautam Ankhad. The bench also stated that stop work notices ought to be issued at the sites showing non-complianceThe panel said demolition activities in Bandra east at the government colony where the new Bombay HC complex is planned, were found to be “generating massive amounts of dust and debris which were scattered openly across premises with no barricades, wet coverings or dust suppression mechanisms in place.”The panel also found “gas cylinders on pavement being used for cutting and sawing steel—in unenclosed spaces immediately adjacent to public areas.’’Senior counsel Darius Khambata, the Amicus Curiae (friend of the court to assist), cited and read the findings from the report prepared by advocates Karan Bhosale, Namrata Vinod, Anand Mallya, and forest conservator Anita Patil. The report indicated that on-ground implementation of civic guidelines to curb air pollution was lacking, and compliance where seen was “cosmetic.”Senior counsel S U Kamdar for BMC sought the matter—a suo motu PIL to tackle the rising air pollution in Mumbai and neighbouring areas—be deferred by a few days to enable the municipal commissioner to read the report. The CJ-led bench orally said, “nothing doing…not even one day. We are summoning them tomorrow.”The bench asked if the sites visited were compliant. Khambata said none were. Senior counsel Ashutosh Kumbhakoni for MPCB said action would be taken and was being contemplated. The CJ, dictating the order, then said, “We have been taken through some part of the report prepared by the Court-appointed Committee running into 74 pages.”Khambata said that the report prepared by the Committee and the observations and findings demonstrate a complete lack of monitoring of the polluting sites, which were not adhering to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) and MPCB guidelines. “We have also taken note of the fact that steps were taken by the authorities after this Court took suo motu cognizance of the poor air quality in Mumbai and the surrounding areas. The report dated December 15 was after the panel visited sites where AQI (Air Quality Index) was poor.The bullet train project at Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC) and an RMC plant and Metro Line 2B were visited and the panel said it found “across all three locations’’ a “recurring pattern of incomplete or inconsistent compliance’’ with BMC’s and MPCB’s air pollution guidelines. “The RMC plant showed the most serious non compliance,’’ it added.At Mahape MPCB Air monitoring station in Navi Mumbai the condition of the station was found to be deeply alarming, reflecting systemic neflect and operational failure’’ the panel said. The outdoor air quality display was completely non-functional down since at least December11, 2025.’’In south Mumbai, in the Fort, Cuffe Parade, and Colaba area, the panel found poor adherence to BMC’s guidelines at four construction and redevelopment sites. The issues involved were not minor lapses but fundamental shortcomings in basic dust control and site management measures, though there was significant scope for corrective action. The report said three of the four were “almost entirely non-compliant with the basic pollution control and safety measures” required under the BMC guidelines. At one site—Opel Constructions—an AQI monitor was installed, but its placement was on the ground floor of the 20-storey under-construction building. The remaining three sites—Kalpataru Chambers, DG Chamber, and Majestic Amdar Nivas—showed widespread and repeated breaches of the required norms, the report said. In the infrastructure projects like the bullet train and Metro, the panel found non-complianceThe compliance across 17 under-construction sites, three ready-mix cement plants, seven road sites, and five infra sites was more ""reactive, rather than proactive,"" with compliance intensifying after the HC's suo motu PIL hearing following the recent spike in Mumbai's AQI. ""Water sprinklers, fogging, and smog guns are deployed in a limited, ad hoc, or cosmetic manner and appear largely confined to areas where authorities claim clear jurisdiction,"" and vehicles carrying demolition waste had no tracking system, while road cleaning activities were ""often spreading pollution"" not suppressing it with no wetting measures, the panel said. It recommended “urgent action” to ensure complete implementation of existing guidelines, real-time monitoring, centralised data integration, differential standards by activity type, and accountability at every site, without which the AQI will deteriorate further and “public health risk will persist unabated.”",Bombay High Court says ground-reality report by a four-member panel prima facie indicates non-compliance with air pollution control civic guidelines at all the 36 sites surveyed.

My family and I were guided to use the security check that the staff use because we had a four-month-old baby in a stroller. The staff were cutting the queue ahead of me. On calling them out, Sejwal, who was doing the same, asked me if I was anpadh (uneducated) and couldn’t read the sign that said the entrance was meant for the staff.“A altercation broke out. Not able to exercise restraint, the pilot proceeded to physically assault me. The blood in the photograph (Dewan posted) on his shirt is mine,” said the flyer, who was to board a SpiceJet flight with his wife, daughter and the infant.Police said the captain, who was flying on IndiGo to Bengaluru as a passenger to join duty and was later grounded by AI Express pending an inquiry, filed the complaint on Sunday.Sejwal’s advocate claimed Dewan initiated the confrontation by verbally abusing him without provocation and continued using abusive, degrading and threatening language even after being asked to stop. “The situation escalated into a physical altercation in which Sejwal also sustained injuries. CISF personnel intervened, repeatedly told Dewan to calm down and stop abusing Sejwal, yet he refused to relent and continued his misconduct,” the advocate said.","Air India Express pilot allegedly assaulted a passenger at IGI Airport’s Terminal 1.

Nvidia Makes History: First Company to Hit $4 Trillion Market Cap

Fear-driven leadership powers AI chip giant's success

Seven-day workweeks extend beyond executive suite





Despite leading the world's most valuable company with a $4.4 trillion market cap, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang operates in constant fear of failure. In a recent appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast, the 62-year-old executive revealed he works seven days a week in a perpetual ""state of anxiety"" about the company going bankrupt.""I'm not ambitious, I just want to stay alive,"" Huang told host Joe Rogan, explaining his 33-year mantra of running Nvidia as if it's ""30 days from going out of business."" The co-founder, who has led the chipmaker since 1993, said this feeling of vulnerability ""doesn't leave you"" despite the company's recent milestone of becoming the first public firm to reach a $5 trillion valuation in October.Huang's unconventional leadership approach stems from near-death experiences in the 1990s when Nvidia faced bankruptcy multiple times. He recalled flying to Japan to inform Sega that a contracted graphics chip was flawed and the deal should be canceled, while simultaneously admitting Nvidia needed the final $5 million payment to survive. Sega converted the funds into an investment, providing the lifeline that kept the company afloat.""I have a greater drive from not wanting to fail than the drive of wanting to succeed,"" Huang explained. The CEO maintains his intense work schedule by waking at 4 a.m.daily to read emails for hours, processing several thousand messages each day. This routine continues through holidays including Thanksgiving and Christmas.Huang's relentless work ethic has influenced his family, with both adult children Madison and Spencer working at Nvidia seven days a week. The siblings, who are in their 30s, initially pursued different careers before joining the company as interns in 2020 and 2022.Nvidia reported record revenue of $57 billion for its third quarter, driven by surging demand for AI chips that power technology from Microsoft, OpenAI and Meta. However, Huang told Rogan that scale hasn't changed his mindset: ""The sense of vulnerability, the sense of uncertainty, the sense of insecurity—it doesn't leave you.""","Jensen Huang, CEO of $4.4 trillion AI chip giant Nvidia, lives in constant fear of bankruptcy.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella once shared his experience of how not going to IIT which he describes as the ""the holy grail"" for middle-class students became a turning point for him. The IIT rejection redirected his life towards a path only few could have imagined and which eventually led him to become the CEO of Microsoft, one of the world’s most valuable companies. Speaking to LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky in 2023, Nadella revealed that as a teenage in Hyderabad his ambition revolved around cricket and banking. He said that he never thought of software. Nadella further added that like many of friends he also viewed IIT as the pinnacle of academic achievement. But when he failed to secure admission, Nadella faced a setback that could have easily defined his future. Instead, it became the catalyst for a different journey.Nadella described IIT as “the holy grail” for middle-class students, acknowledging the weight of expectations. Yet, he later reflected that not getting in forced him to explore other opportunities ones that ultimately shaped his resilience and adaptability.After getting rejected from IIT, Nadella got enrolled at the Manipal Institute of Technology, where he studied electrical engineering. The decision of taking admission in Manipal Institute of Technology set him on a trajectory that would take him to the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee for a master’s degree.After completing his masters he enrolled in the University of Chicago for an MBA.Nadella also recalled that after reaching the US he faced cultural shocks, homesickness and the challenge of proving himself in a new country. He said that he often joked about the fact that he simply cannot locate Milwaukee on a map before moving there. However, all these experiences helped him in building adaptability which later went ahead and defined his leadership style.Nadella joined Microsoft in 1992, after working at Sun Microsystems. Over, the next two decade he rose steadily through the ranks and the became the Microsoft CEO in 2014. When Nadella became the CEO, the company was facing a lot competition from Apple, Google and Amazon. However, under his leadership, Microsoft reinvented itself and it now a market valuation of $3.54 trillion.Nadella has often said that “only in America would someone like me get the chance to prove himself rather than be typecast based on the school I attended.”","Satya Nadella once shared his experience of how not going to IIT which he describes as the ""the holy grail"" for middle-class students became a turning point for him.

Alexandr Wang is reportedly clashing with Meta’s old guard

Meta’s Secret AI Army: Top Talent Hired from OpenAI, Google & More

Alexandr Wang memo on Meta's massive AI restructure





In June this year, Facebook-parent Meta Platforms agreed to take a 49% stake in artificial intelligence (AI) startup Scale AI for $14.8 billion. As part of the deal, Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang took top position inside Meta, leading the company's new “superintelligence” lab, , Meta Superintelligence Labs, or MSL. The 28-year-old founder of Scale AI, Wang has been installed as the public face of Zuckerberg’s AI reboot. Mark Zuckerberg reportedly paid billions to bring billionaire AI prodigy Alexandr Wang on board. However, it reportedly seems that all is not well between the AI wunderkind and his Boss, Mark Zuckerberg. The 41-year-old Zuckerberg is said to have backed his new hires with nine-figure compensation packages to lure top researchers from rivals, igniting a Silicon Valley poaching war.According to a report in Financial Times, Wang privately believes that CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s micromanagement of the company’s AI push is ""suffocating"". Wang is said to have complained to associates that Zuckerberg’s tight grip on the effort is stifling progress, the report said, citing multiple people familiar with the situation. Report adds that cracks have begun to emerge at an executive level and that tensions have been bubbling between Wang and Zuckerberg for sometime now.As per the report, internally, some staff question whether Wang is out of his depth, given his lack of experience managing teams in a large corporation but also his expertise in AI data services rather than as an AI researcher pushing technical breakthroughs.Incidentally, Alexander Wang’s arrival at Meta has created friction over the company's fundamental approach to AI development, with his superintelligence team pushing to make the company’s next model “closed” — keeping its technology secret. This is said to mark a major departure from Meta’s longtime philosophy of open-sourcing its models for other developers to build upon, causing some old guard members to chafe at the change, the Times reported.The new leadership has chosen to abandon Meta’s previous frontier model called Behemoth, which saw its release delayed last spring after disappointing performance tests. Meta’s AI division faces a dramatic four-way split as Meta reorganizes into groups focused on research, superintelligence development, products, and infrastructure, according to the report.As the new vision and leadership have crystallised, some top names have left. Among them, in recent weeks, Meta’s longtime chief legal officer Jennifer Newstead was poached by arch-rival Apple, while chief revenue officer John Hegeman announced he too was leaving to launch a start-up.Similarly, chief AI scientist and Turing Award winner Yann LeCun is departing Meta to launch a new AI initiative. He had reportedly taken exception at having to report to Wang. Another reason cited for his resignation is that his longer-term research was reportedly hit hard by the recent cuts announced at Meta.Meta reorganized its AI teams in June this year. The memo said that most team leaders will report directly to 28-year-old Wang. This included investor and former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman, who heads MSL's product team and was announced as an MSL leader alongside Wang in June. In the email sent to employees, Wang wrote that ""superintelligence is coming,"" and to ""take it seriously,"" Meta needs to make major changes.",Mark Zuckerberg reportedly paid billions to bring billionaire AI prodigy Alexandr Wang on board. Wang is said to have complained to associates that Zuckerberg’s tight grip on the effort is stifling progress. Some staff question whether Wang is out of his depth given his lack of experience managing teams in a large corporation.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126064464,imgsize-16686,width-400,resizemode-4/mark-zuckerberg.jpg"

Demis Hassabis makes his stand clear on AI scaling





Google DeepMind CEo Demis Hassabis has once again warned that the present wave of AI startup valuations is unsustainable. He also raised concerns that there are chances that the tech sector is heading towards a correction. Speaking on Google DeepMind: The Podcast, Hassabis said many early-stage companies are now raising tens of billions dollars before even launching product. He believes that this trend exposes cracks in the valuation model. “Some startups basically haven’t even got going yet,” Hassabis said. “It’s sort of interesting to see how can that be sustainable. My guess is probably not, at least not in general.” This increase in speculative funding has drawn comparisons to past bubbles, such as the dot-com boom and the crypto frenzy, where companies raised massive sums on hype rather than proven business models.Hassabis emphasised that these seed-stage valuations with investments by established companies like Google, which he said are backed by “a lot of real business.” While Big Tech’s AI bets are supported by revenue streams and infrastructure, many startups are relying solely on investor enthusiasm.He added that AI is “overhyped in the short term” but “underappreciated in the medium to long-term,” suggesting that while the technology’s potential is profound, the current funding frenzy may not reflect sustainable growth.Reflecting on DeepMind’s own early days, Hassabis noted how technological shifts often swing from skepticism to obsession, inflating valuations quickly. “It’s almost an overreaction to the underreaction,” he said, pointing out that investor sentiment can flip dramatically once a technology gains traction.Recently, Google DeepMind CEO also made his stand clear on the debate over how far AI scaling laws can take the industry.As reported by Business Insider, speaking at the Axios AI+ Summit in San Francisco, Hassabis said that scaling current systems must be pushed to the maximum, calling it a critical path towards artificial general intelligence (AGI). “The scaling of the current systems, we must push that to the maximum, because at the minimum, it will be a key component of the final AGI system. It could be the entirety of the AGI system,” Hassabis told the audience.AGI is still a theoretical form of AI which is capable of reasoning as well as humans. AGI is also the ultimate goal for leading AI companies that are driving billions in spending on infrastructure and talent. Scaling laws suggest that the more data and compute an AI model receives, the smarter it becomes.",Google DeepMind CEo Demis Hassabis has warned that the present wave of AI startup valuations is unsustainable.

Cyber thugs posed as wealth mgmt advisors: Former IPS officer in note

PATIALA: Former Punjab Police IG Amar Singh Chahal , 66, is battling for life after a self-inflicted gunshot to the chest at his Patiala home on Monday. Police say he shot himself with his gunman’s licenced revolver.This is the second such incident involving an IPS officer in the region after Haryana ADG Y Puran Kumar shot himself dead with his gunman’s pistol at his Chandigarh home in Oct.A12-page handwritten note found on the scene details how ex-IG Chahal was cheated of Rs 8.1 crore in a “highly sophisticated” online investment fraud that operated through WhatsApp and Telegram under the name ‘F-777 DBS Wealth Equity Research Group’. It falsely claimed regulatory approvals and links with well-known financial institutions, the note says.Police are investigating the allegations. It’s a disturbing indicator of how deeply such scams have penetrated society and can trap even those who are seemingly aware of the baits and lures.Patiala SP Palwinder Singh Cheema said one of Chahal’s friends alerted police that he may have attempted suicide after getting a message from him.A police team rushed to his house in ‘26-Acre’ locality around 1.45pm and found him unconscious, with a bullet wound to the chest. A revolver lay close by. He was breathing, say police sources. Chahal’s son and daughter-in-law were in another room during the incident, say police.“Chahal is undergoing treatment in hospital and his condition is critical,” said Patiala SSP Varun Sharma. Late evening, Cheema said Chahal had undergone surgery and was on recovery mode but the next 24 hours will be crucial. “Our immediate priority is his treatment. We are also preserving evidence and examining the allegations mentioned in the note,” said Cheema.Police said Chahal, a 1990batch IPS officer, had not filed any complaint regarding the alleged fraud. According to officials who have seen the note, Chahal wrote that he was cheated by cyber criminals who posed as wealth management advisors.Chahal describes in the note how fraudsters posing as ‘senior executives and advisors’ of the firm gradually gained the confidence of investors by offering daily market tips, simulated dashboards and purportedly highreturn investment products. He alleged that the scheme progressed through multiple stages — daily trading, initial public offerings, over-thecounter trades and so-called quantitative funds — each promising escalating returns.Chahal claimed that as confidence grew, investors were encouraged to deposit larger sums while “planted participants” vouched for the scheme’s authenticity whenever doubts were raised. But when he sought to withdraw funds, he was asked to pay hefty service charges, taxes and membership fees, and was even coaxed into paying an alleged bribe to expedite withdrawals, says the note. Despite making repeated payments, no money was released.The former IG said that he had written to the Prime Minister, Union home minister and Union finance minister, seeking intervention. He urged authorities to constitute an SIT or hand the case to a central agency, arguing that only a specialised probe could “dismantle what the nationwide cyber-fraud network”.He has listed multiple bank accounts through which transfers were allegedly made and claimed that while about Rs 1 crore was his own money, more than Rs 7 crore was borrowed from friends and relatives. In his note, he expressed deep remorse and fear about the financial and emotional impact on his family, while repeatedly stating that no one else should be held responsible for his actions.The note also appealed for protection and assistance for his family and requested that creditors refrain from pressuring them.Chahal had preserved screenshots of dashboards, transaction records and chat histories, which he referenced in the note. Investigators are tracing the alleged transactions and examining the digital evidence he cited.Residents of Patiala and former colleagues described Chahal as a capable officer, who empathised with farmers’ issues and concerns of the Sikh community.","Former Punjab Police IG Amar Singh Chahal, 66, is battling for life after a self-inflicted gunshot to the chest at his Patiala home on Monday.

Markets were very volatile during 2025, with the Nifty falling below 22,000 in March before recovering and shooting past 26,000 in October. Analysts expect heightened volatility to continue in 2026 as well. Investors can cushion themselves by opting for dynamic asset allocation funds in the coming year.Dynamic asset allocation funds, also known as balanced advantage funds, are hybrid schemes that change their asset mix depending on market conditions. While equity funds delivered flat to negative returns during 2025, the dynamic asset allocation category has managed to give 4.57% average returns. ICICI Prudential Balanced Advantage Fund, the best performing fund in the category, delivered double digit returns ().This was possible because unlike balanced funds which maintain a 65% exposure to equity and the rest to debt, dynamic asset allocation funds can invest between zero and 100% in equities. Some funds depend on the fund manager’s ability to read the situation while others follow a rule-based approach. When the market valuation is high, these funds will reduce the exposure to equities and shift to the safety of debt. When markets decline, they will automatically ramp up the allocation to equities while slashing the exposure to debt.No doubt, this seems like a win-win situation for the investor. However, in reality the mandate of managing asset allocation dynamically can be difficult to follow. Investors can be disappointed if the fund does not time its asset-allocation shifts correctly. Besides, since there is no predefined limit on the minimum allocation requirement of each asset class, the decision of deciding the asset mix is left to the discretion of the fund manager. Therefore, the asset allocation in this category, as also the returns, vary from fund to fund.The choice of funds in this space is critical. In turbulent phases, an asset allocation fund truly serves its purpose if it lets you to keep your cool and gives you the comfort of staying invested even during the tough times. That’s why it is a good idea to look under the hood before you invest. Some funds are more aggressive than others, but experts say it is better to opt for funds that follow a moderate-to-conservative stance. Avoid chasing returns in this category. Funds that lay emphasis on controlling risk are better than those offering an edge in returns.There are also downsides to dynamic asset allocation funds. One, they tend to lose out if the markets continue rising when they have reduced the equity exposure. And two, given that they do not maintain a 65% exposure to equities, these funds do not qualify for the favourable tax treatment enjoyed by equity-oriented funds.","Dynamic asset allocation funds, also known as balanced advantage funds, are hybrid schemes that change their asset mix depending on market conditions.
