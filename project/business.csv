"With juvenile on board, pay 2x fine for breaking traffic rules",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/with-juvenile-on-board-pay-2x-fine-for-breaking-traffic-rules/articleshow/122790079.cms,"Representational Image

NEW DELHI: The road transport ministry has proposed doubling of penalty for traffic rule violation by people driving with children, a move that will ensure safety and responsibility. It has also proposed a ""merit and demerit (positive and negative) point system"" for all drivers based on their compliance with or violation of traffic rules.The changes have been proposed as part of amendments to the Motor Vehicles Act, and these have been circulated among ministries for their feedback, TOI has learnt. Sources said the proposal of doubling penalty for traffic rule violation has been made considering rampant non-compliance of norms by parents and family members driving with children and by buses owned or hired by schools to transport students. The higher penalty is aimed at making both drivers and vehicle owners responsible.However, a section of road safety experts feel that any addition to the list of offences may end up only as a ""better"" legislative exercise and another avenue for corruption, if not implemented objectively.""Even now traffic cops catch and penalise drivers only for half a dozen offences such as speeding, drunk driving, jumping red signal, using phone and not wearing seatbelt or helmet, while the MV law covers over 100 offences.How will cameras installed identify if a juvenile is sitting in the rear seat of a car and will police personnel stop vehicles and check the age of people sitting inside? While framing laws and policies we don't think of India but Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and big cities,"" an expert said.As far as the proposal of ""merit and demerit"" points system for drivers is concerned, govt will set a threshold for demerit points and any driver accumulating negative marks beyond that will face the risk of suspension and cancellation of his/her driving licence. The ministry has also proposed to link insurance premium to behaviour of drivers, which will be reflected through positive and negative points.Sources said the proposed amendments include mandatory driving test for DL holders applying for renewal before expiry of licence, if they have violated traffic rules.","Road transport ministry has proposed doubling of penalty for traffic rule violation by people driving with children.

With the latest arrest, the number of accused arrested so far has increased to 12.Earlier, Midhun Reddy arrived in Vijayawada from New Delhi amid heightened security. Krishna district police, under the supervision of Gannavaram DSP, ensured a tight security cordon around the airport. All vehicles entering the premises were thoroughly inspected, and the MP was escorted by police to the SIT office. Police had earlier issued a lookout notice and alerted immigration authorities.The SIT, constituted to investigate alleged irregularities in the liquor policy during the previous YSRCP regime, has been probing alleged illegal financial transactions, policy manipulation, and the misuse of official machinery in the framing and implementation of the state's liquor policy.Sources close to the probe said Reddy was allegedly involved in key decision-making meetings regarding the state's liquor procurement and distribution mechanisms. The SIT has reportedly tracked a Rs 5 crore fund transfer from a third-party company to a firm linked to the MP, raising suspicions of money laundering and quid pro quo arrangements.Officials believe Midhun Reddy possesses crucial information about the ultimate beneficiaries of the proceeds generated through the liquor policy.","YSRCP MP P V Midhun Reddy was arrested by Andhra SIT late on Saturday after nearly seven hours of questioning in the alleged Rs 3,200 crore liquor scam.

India warns West on energy security double standards,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-warns-west-on-energy-security-double-standards/articleshow/122674405.cms,"Petroleum minister Hardeep Singh Puri

NEW DELHI: India can arrange alternative supplies if Russian oil exports are sanctioned, petroleum minister Hardeep Singh Puri said on Thursday in what is seen as the first official reaction to the US and EU threat of secondary sanctions for buying those barrels.“India has diversified the sources (of oil). I am not worried at all. If something happens, we will deal with it. There is sufficient supply available,” Puri said at an industry event.Separately, the foreign ministry said govt’s overriding priority was to secure the energy needs of its people, while also cautioning against any double standards on the issue.The comments, in response to media queries, followed NATO chief Mark Rutte’s threat, echoing the US, that countries like India, China and Brazil would take a battering for buying Russian exports.“Let me reiterate, and I have said this in the past as well. Securing energy needs of our people is understandably an overriding priority for us,” MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said.“In this endeavour, we are guided by what is there on offer in the markets, as also by the prevailing global circumstances. We would particularly caution against any double standards on the matter,” he added. India has in the past too accused the West of having double standards on the issue, saying that European countries have themselves benefited from importing Russian energy for prolonged periods.Puri said India has built up “navigational resilience” by expanding the sourcing of oil from 40 countries against 27 countries earlier. “India has been clear that it will buy oil from wherever it has to. The prime minister’s commitment, in the final analysis, is to the Indian consumer,” he said.In addition, Puri said, more oil was coming into the global market from countries such as Brazil, Guyana and Canada that are not members of the OPEC+ grouping. “If a major source goes off the market, you diversify. The current debate in the oil market is whether prices will be in the range of $65-70 or $60-65 (per barrel),” he said.","India can arrange alternative supplies if Russian oil exports are sanctioned, petroleum minister Hardeep Singh Puri said.

China on Saturday started building a major dam on the Brahmaputra river in southeastern Tibet near border with India. Chinese Premier Li Qiang attended the groundbreaking ceremony, news agency AFP reported citing local media.The project was approved by Beijing in December and is being linked to China’s carbon neutrality targets and development goals in the Tibet region.""The electricity generated will be primarily transmitted to other regions for consumption, while also meeting local power needs in Tibet,"" China’s official news agency Xinhua reported after the ceremony in Nyingchi, a region close to Arunachal Pradesh.The construction will involve five hydropower stations, with an estimated investment of 1.2 trillion yuan (around $167 billion), according to Xinhua.Once completed, the dam is expected to generate more electricity than the Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River, raising concerns in downstream countries, India and Bangladesh. Experts have said the project could affect the water flow and ecology of the Brahmaputra river system.India had raised concerns about the project earlier this year. In January, the ministry of external affairs said, ""China has been urged to ensure that the interests of the downstream states of the Brahmaputra are not harmed by activities in upstream areas.""China had responded saying the dam over the Yarlung Tsangpo ( the Tibetan name for Brahmaputra river) would not cause any “negative impact” downstream.Environmental groups have also flagged the impact of such large projects in the ecologically sensitive Tibetan plateau, warning that it could lead to irreversible changes in the region.","China on Saturday started building a major dam on the Brahmaputra river in southeastern Tibet near border with India.

The Ministry of Labour announced that anyone working or seeking to work as an “engineer” must first secure a professional classification certificate. This must be issued by the Oman Society of Engineers (OSE) and approved by the Sector Skills Unit. As of that date, no work permit in engineering will be issued or renewed without it, via the Ministry’s online platform.A similar requirement will apply to 20 specific accounting, finance, and audit roles, including CFOs, external/internal auditors, controllers, cost accountants, and more. These positions will require a Sector Skills Unit Professional Classification Certificate for Accounting, Finance and Auditing for any new or renewed work permit.The following roles in the accounting and finance sector will require professional certification:The Ministry confirmed that no exceptions will be made. Employers and foreign professionals must now apply via the e-services portal and obtain the necessary certifications prior to work permit issuance or renewal. Non-compliance may result in denial of applications or unexecuted renewals.These measures align with wider Omanisation and professional competency goals, increasingly seen in GCC countries seeking to enhance workforce quality.Oman’s move echoes similar steps in Saudi Arabia and UAE, where accreditation and licenses are required for specialties like engineering, finance, and healthcare.Local engineering firms and audit practices are reportedly checking eligibility lists to prepare affected staff for compliance. No major backlash has surfaced online, though global recruitment agencies note companies are beginning internal skill audits and credential upgrades.Employers and professionals should:Oman’s enforcement of professional classification for engineers and accountants is a significant labour-market upgrade. With clear deadlines, digital enforcement, and no exemptions, this signals a strong regulatory shift: credentials matter, and Omanisation remains a national priority. By following these steps, employers can ensure uninterrupted operations and compliance; professionals can secure their roles; and Oman’s agenda for a qualified, local talent base gains momentum.","From August 2025, engineers and accountants in Oman must secure official certification to obtain or renew work permits. The Ministry of Labour is enforcing the changes through its e-services system. The aim is to standardize professional qualifications, enhance competency, and bolster Omanisation goals.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122739697,imgsize-188083,width-400,resizemode-4/122739697.jpg"
"H-1B visa: US considering 'weighted selection process' for hiring foreigners, DHS drafting new rule",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/h-1b-visa-us-considering-weighted-selection-process-for-hiring-foreigners-dhs-drafting-new-rule/articleshow/122785108.cms,"No lottery for H-1B? New rule may add weightage on the wage offered for a position.

H-1B: Lottery versus weighted selection process







The Donald Trump administration is considering introducing a new process for H-1B hiring under the capped part of the system. The Department of Homeland Security sent the proposal to the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs for review. The capped part of the system means the statutory cap decided by Congress for every year. The cap is 85,000 slots, including 20,000 reserved for workers who have a master's degree.Universities and research institutions are eligible for cap-exempt visas.For 2026, the USCIS has already closed the process as they announced Friday that enough petitions had been submitted to reach the annual cap, which means there will be no lottery for FY 2026.In the present system, there's a random lottery each year for visas subject to the cap. After the lottery, employers with winning entries submit petitions to sponsor workers who will join their companies around October.In Donald Trump's first term, the DHS came up with a selection process based on the wage offered for a position instead of the random lottery so that companies hire more high-skilled workers instead of filling their positions with low-wage foreign workers.That rule, one of several offered as part of a “Buy American, Hire American” initiative, was later shelved by the Biden administration in 2021. The draft regulations drew more than 1,000 public comments, including many that argued it would drastically reduce the number of available H-1B workers, Bloomberg reported.The lottery system was brought in so that no company or applicant would get any favor. But larger companies can apply for more visas resulting in such companies getting more H-1Bs.In January, the Institute for Progress, a nonpartisan think tank examining innovation policy, floated the idea of eliminating the H-1B lottery. It argued that the economic value of the visa program could be increased by 88 per cent of applicants were evaluated based on seniority or salary.","The Department of Homeland Security sent the proposal to the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs for review.

A recent study published in Nature Medicine by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), a specialised agency of the World Health Organization (WHO), has issued a stark warning: the world is facing a significant surge in gastric cancer cases, with Asia—and particularly India—bearing the brunt. The study analysed people born between 2008 and 2017 and estimated that 15.6 million individuals globally from this generation are at risk of developing gastric cancer in their lifetime. Worryingly, almost two-thirds of these cases will occur in Asia, largely due to high population numbers and ongoing exposure to risk factors.The study highlights that India and China together could account for approximately 6.5 million new gastric cancer cases in the coming decades. This projection positions Asia as the global hotspot for the disease. The rise is largely driven by factors such as rapid population growth, increasing life expectancy, and a continued prevalence of key risk factors—many of which are still not adequately addressed through public health measures. These include poor sanitation, limited access to healthcare, and dietary habits that may increase stomach cancer risk.Experts say this could make gastric cancer one of India’s biggest future health crises if timely action is not taken.One of the most important takeaways from the study is that Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is the leading cause of future gastric cancer cases—accounting for about 76% of them. This bacterium infects the lining of the stomach and can remain undetected for years. Over time, it causes inflammation that can lead to ulcers and eventually cancer. In India, where access to preventive screening is limited and awareness is low, H. pylori often goes untreated, significantly raising the risk of long-term health complications. The study urges stronger surveillance and early intervention programmes to tackle this hidden epidemic.Currently, gastric cancer is the fifth most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide, but its burden is not evenly distributed. While some regions, like Sub-Saharan Africa, report relatively low incidence rates today, the study warns of a six-fold increase in cases in those areas over time. In contrast, India’s numbers are expected to rise more sharply and sooner due to existing health inequalities, limited diagnostic infrastructure, and lack of widespread awareness about early symptoms. This puts millions of Indians at a heightened and preventable risk.The research points to a clear solution: early screening and treatment of H. pylori can dramatically reduce future cases of gastric cancer—by as much as 75%. In countries like India, where healthcare resources may be stretched, focusing on population-wide, low-cost screening initiatives could be a game-changer. Treating H. pylori with antibiotics and simple follow-up care could save countless lives and significantly ease the burden on the healthcare system. These preventive steps are not only scientifically sound but also financially viable.Perhaps the most alarming finding from the study is that gastric cancer is increasingly affecting younger individuals, especially those born after 2008. This is a major shift from previous decades when the disease primarily affected older adults.Combined with India’s ageing population, this trend could create a dual burden of both young and elderly patients requiring long-term cancer care. Without timely intervention, India risks reversing years of public health progress in cancer control.India must take public health action against gastric cancerTo reduce its future gastric cancer burden, India needs to adopt a multi-pronged public health strategy. The study recommends:These actions are essential not only to control gastric cancer rates but also to build long-term resilience in India’s public health system.With projections estimating over 1.6 million new gastric cancer cases in India alone, the country is at a crossroads. The study’s findings are a powerful reminder that prevention is not just possible—it is necessary. Investing in screening, early detection, and health education can prevent hundreds of thousands of deaths and reduce the financial and emotional toll on families. If India acts now, it can turn the tide and prevent gastric cancer from becoming an unstoppable epidemic in the decades to come.",Gastric cancer is rising in India faster than in many regions.

GTA 6: What Konvoy analyst Josh Chapman predicted about GTA 6’s success



“🎮 GTA VI: we predict that GTA VI will generate $7.6 BILLION in revenue in the first 60 Days of its launch (current release date: May 26, 2026). This will be the greatest video game release of all time; shattering player, viewership, and revenue records.

For Take-Two Interactive's $2 billion investment into this game, we believe they will break even on that within 30 days of release (see our breakdown in the chart attached).

🚀 Predictions: Our Expectations of GTA VI:

We chatted internally here at Konvoy and decided to write down a few predictions and make them public. In the end, we're just gamers who can't wait to see this title released:

1️⃣ GTA VI is the largest gaming release of all time, shattering records of copies sold and revenue generated within almost every period of time

2️⃣ GTA VI will cost $80 (there will be premium versions of course, but the base price is $80)

3️⃣ GTA VI is the next UGC platform. It will have a UGC component that includes creator payouts for server hosts, mod creators, and more (mimicking the creator economics of UEFN and Roblox)

4️⃣ GTA VI will have 200-person lobbies, and there will be higher risk/reward dynamics where you can raid and steal items from players more easily

5️⃣ GTA VI will break even on its $2bn investment <30 days of release

6️⃣ GTA VI will hit the attached chart of copies sold, revenue, and player targets.

We can't wait for this title to be released in 2026. I'll certainly be playing it.”

Bill Gates No Longer among Top 10 Billionaires: The Real Reason

Grand Theft Auto 6 (GTA 6) is set to launch in May next year. Meanwhile, investment firm Konvoy has made some major predictions for the upcoming open world title’s financial performance. The video game venture capitalist company suggests that GTA 6 will generate $7.6 billion in revenue within just two months or 60 days of its release. Josh Chapman, a managing partner of Konvoy, shared this forecast on a post shared on the professional networking site LinkedIn. He highlighted that the firm believes that the highly anticipated game will have major commercial success. However, it's important to note that Konvoy's projection is based on certain assumptions that Take-Two Interactive has not yet confirmed, such as an $80 price point for the game and a reported budget of around $2 billion, which the company is said to have spent to develop the game.Konvoy's analysis suggests that GTA 6 could recover its estimated $2 billion budget in under 30 days and build considerable momentum. The firm predicts that it may become the gaming industry’s biggest launch to date and is expected to break records for both copies sold and revenue generated by a game. Considering that analysts have referred to GTA 6 as ""the most important game to ever release in the industry,"" a multi-billion dollar revenue figure may be within reach for the title.In his LinkedIn post, Chapman wrote:",Grand Theft Auto 6 (GTA 6) is set to launch in May next year.

The company, which generated $43 billion in revenue during the first quarter, has now exceeded Meta's quarterly earnings, Reuters reported quoting sources.The US consortium backed by the administration in the TikTok deal includes private equity firm KKR and new investors like Andreessen Horowitz, with Oracle also expected to take a stake. However, it remains unclear whether all original consortium members are still part of the bid.Earlier this year, the group was working on a plan to spin off TikTok’s US operations into a separate American company. But negotiations stalled after China signaled it would block the deal, shortly after Trump announced new tariffs on Chinese imports.If a deal goes through, TikTok's US operations are expected to be run by a new joint venture between an American investor group and ByteDance, which would retain a minority stake.Blackstone’s decision to withdraw underscores the growing uncertainty and complications surrounding the deal. The future of TikTok has become entangled in broader US-China trade tensions, with Trump indicating he would discuss the issue directly with Chinese President Xi Jinping.TikTok is already developing a separate version of the app for the US market.","Private equity firm's exit comes amid growing uncertainty and multiple delays in the TikTok transaction.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares.

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

‘Most consequential 3 seconds’: Ex-Alaska Airlines pilot recalls attempting to shut off flight’s engine mid-air; feared fatal end,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/most-consequential-3-seconds-ex-alaska-airlines-pilot-recalls-attempting-to-shut-off-flights-engine-mid-air-feared-fatal-end/articleshow/122691296.cms,"ANI file photo





Former Alaska Airlines pilot Joseph Emerson, recalls the most “consequential three seconds” of his life when he had pulled down levers that could cut off fuel to the engines in an Alaska Air Flight 2059, reports CBS News. He had reportedly been under the influence of “magic mushrooms” and lost sense of reality.Emerson boarded the flight bound for San Francisco as a passenger from Everett, Washington with 83 other passengers and crew on board. He was assigned the cockpit jump seat located behind the pilot and first officer.""I had no intention of crashing an actual airplane. I wanted to wake up. I was convinced I wasn't going home to my wife and kids,"" he said in an interview with CBS News on Thursday.At that time he was grieving the death of his best friend and reportedly experimented with the psychedelic drug.""You're not going home. You need to wake up. That's when I acted. I pulled the handles that were in front of my face,"" he said recalling the incident. ""I mean, in the dream, in that dissociative state, I thought they were going to wake me up. It didn't wake me up, right? I was in reality. I know that now. You know, it's the most consequential three seconds of my life.”""I know what those levers do in a real airplane and I need to wake up from this. You know, it's 30 seconds of my life that I wish I could change, and I can't,” he was quoted saying by ABC News.The flight was diverted and landed safely in Portland, Oregon, where Emerson was taken into custody. He is scheduled to face trial next month on a federal charge of interfering with a flight crew, and also faces numerous state charges, including 83 misdemeanor counts of reckless endangerment and one felony count of first-degree endangering an aircraft, reported CBS News.Since then the National Transportation Safety Board has since hosted a first-of-its-kind forum focused on pilot mental health to examine current regulations.The FAA launched its own policy review, with both agencies advocating for reforms to remove barriers to mental health care.""Our pilots and air traffic controllers are not going to lose their job when they ask for help. We in this country must recognize that that's strength. And they're not to be punished. We're going to help them, process them, and get them back into cockpits,"" said Minnesota Rep. Pete Stauber, reported CBS News.Illinois Rep. Sean Casten and Minnesota Rep. Pete Stauber are spearheading a bipartisan push in Congress to implement reforms within two years through the Mental Health in Aviation Act. The legislation aims to improve access to mental health care for pilots and air traffic controllers and expand the number of medical examiners available.","Former Alaska Airlines pilot Joseph Emerson recalls the most “consequential three seconds” of his life when he had pulled down levers that could cut off fuel to the engines in an Alaska Air Flight 2059.

Astronomer co-founder speaks up





As Astronomer suspended Andy Byron after his Coldplay kiss cam video with company HR head Kristin Cabot went viral, accounts of his toxic leadership are surfacing one by one. A 2018 report detailed the mismanagement of startup Cybereason, the company where Byron used to work as the chief revenue officer. The report claimed that the employees of the SoftBank-backed startup blamed Byron's hiring as the beginning of the turmoil.""Multiple former employees said Mr. Byron would lash out against employees who disagreed with him, including threatening to fire them. 'You couldn’t challenge him,' a former employee who worked for Mr Byron said. After that hiring, current and former employees described a shift in culture from a company that had previously prized transparency to one where it was lacking,"" the 2018 report said.After Byron joined the company, he brought in a crew of salespeople from his former company Fuze. At that time, Byron denied having any contentious dealings with staff and said he was hired bu Cybereason to help the company reach its next phase of growth and for that, he had to make some difficult decisions that might have disappointed some individuals.Cut to 2025, and one of the reasons behind the Coldplay video blowing up on social media is the disgruntled workers of the company.Several former employees, on anonymity, disclosed that the social media groups of former employees were erupting as the toxicity that Byron spread finally caught up with him.Ry Walker, the co-founder of Astronomer, spoke up in the wake of the controversy and also praised the decision of the company to make Pete Dejoy as the interim CEO. ""I’ve found Andy to be professional, I’ve only ever been on a call with him once. Everyone on the team has praised his leadership to me. So I think this is an unfortunate development that comes as a big surprise,"" Walker said.""For those asking - I’m no longer involved in @astronomerio - yes I was co-founder and early CEO - not on the team or board since 2022, and have no information on ColdplayGate,"" he wrote.","Astronomer CEO Andy Byron was accused of causing turmoil in his previous office as well.

Who is Kristin Cabot inside Astronomer



A brief look at Privateer Rum and a 240-year family story



The $2.2-million Rye, New Hampshire home



From concert clip to corporate investigation



Why the fallout matters beyond company gossip







Before this month, Kristin Cabot was known mainly inside HR circles. As chief people officer at Astronomer, a fast-growing data-orchestration start-up, her job rarely drew public notice. That changed when a kiss-cam at a Coldplay concert flashed a brief, intimate hug between Cabot and Astronomer CEO Andy Byron. The clip went viral, the board placed both executives on leave, and internet sleuths went looking for back-story. What they found added unexpected layers: Cabot is married to Andrew Cabot, chief executive of Privateer Rum and direct descendant of an eighteenth-century New England privateer-turned-distiller. The couple also bought a $2.2-million home in the seaside town of Rye, New Hampshire, just five months before the concert. A workplace-conduct probe now runs in parallel with a burst of curiosity about craft spirits, old maritime fortunes, and modern start-up culture.Cabot joined Astronomer in 2023 as chief people officer after a decade in HR leadership at two Boston software firms. Her remit covers recruiting, pay equity, and workplace policy.Those policies are now under the microscope because the Coldplay video raised questions about disclosure rules for relationships between top executives. Astronomer’s board has installed co-founder Pete DeJoy as acting chief while an outside law firm interviews staff.Privateer Rum operates from a warehouse in Ipswich, Massachusetts, but trades heavily on history. The modern label cites Andrew Cabot (1750-1791)—merchant, wartime privateer, and rum producer—as its patriarch. Today’s distillery ferments molasses in long, cool cycles, ages barrels in New England’s damp climate, and sells bottles that can top US$100 on limited release. Kristin Cabot has sat on the distillery’s advisory board since 2020, a role the company highlights in investor decks that focus on brand authenticity.In February 2025, the Cabots closed on a four-bedroom house overlooking the Atlantic. Local registry deeds put the price at $2.2 million—about 45 percent above Rye’s median listing that month. The town of 6,000 offers low property-tax rates and an hour-long commute to Boston’s venture-capital corridor, making it popular with tech executives who want coastal privacy. Real estate agents say homes above the $2 million mark make up fewer than five per cent of annual sales in the area, underscoring the purchase’s scale.During Coldplay’s July show at Gillette Stadium, the jumbotron caught Byron with his arms around Cabot. Singer Chris Martin joked on stage, and the video raced across social feeds. Within forty-eight hours Astronomer’s board hired outside counsel, citing “potential breach of internal relationship-disclosure policy.” Both executives were put on paid leave pending findings.The scandal lands at a sensitive moment for both organisations. Astronomer closed a $93 million Series D in May 2025 after posting 150 percent year-over-year revenue growth. Investors typically vet leadership stability before wiring funds. At the same time, Privateer Rum is expanding distribution to 22 states and courting new capital for a barrel-warehouse build-out. Any reputational dent to the Cabot name could complicate those talks. Brand consultants say craft-spirit buyers prize authenticity, and a narrative that links historical romance with modern HR controversy could blur that image.","Kristin Cabot is married to Andrew Cabot, chief executive of Privateer Rum and direct descendant of an eighteenth-century New England privateer-turned- distiller.

Opioid prescriptions without medical purpose



Sexual favors for opioid prescription



False bills for in-person visits that never happened







Ritesh Kalra, an Indian-origin New Jersey doctor, has been charged with multiple medical frauds, including the distribution of opioids without any legitimate medical purpose, billing the visits that never happened. Kalra also solicited sexual favors from patients in exchange for opioid prescriptions. According to DOJ documents, Kalwa is now on home arrest and is also prohibited from practicing medicine and prescribing medication and will be required to shut down his medical practice while the case is pending.Dr Kalra allegedly operated a pill mill out of his medical office, where he routinely prescribed high-dose opioids—including oxycodone—and promethazine with codeine to patients without a legitimate medical purpose. Between January 2019 and February 2025, Kalra issued more than 31,000 prescriptions for oxycodone, including days when he wrote upwards of 50 prescriptions.Several of Kalra’s former employees claimed that female patients complained that Kalra touched them sexually and demanded sexual favors of them, including oral sex, in order to obtain their prescriptions. One patient even claimed she was forced to do anal sex during her clinical appointments.Another patient continued to receive opioid prescriptions from Kalra when the patient was incarcerated at Essex County Correctional Facility and had no contact with Kalra.Kalra also allegedly billed for in-person visits and counseling sessions that never occurred. As part of the health care fraud scheme, Kalra’s electronic medical records allegedly contained false progress notes listing fabricated dates of service, and included examination notes that were generally identical from visit to visit and did not record vital signs.US attorney Alina Habba said Dr Kalsa used the position of responsibility held by physicians to fuel addiction among his patients. “Physicians hold a position of profound responsibility—but as alleged, Dr. Kalra used that position to fuel addiction, exploit vulnerable patients for sex, and defraud New Jersey’s public healthcare program. By allegedly exchanging prescriptions for sexual favors and billing Medicaid for ghost appointments, he not only violated the law but endangered lives. Our Office will continue to pursue those who turn their medical licenses into tools for personal gain and sexual gratification,"" Alina Habba said.","Ritesh Kalra, an Indian-origin New Jersey doctor, has been charged with multiple medical frauds.

Poliovirus found in 20 Pakistani districts amid rising vaccine refusals: New sewage data signals resurgence; 13th polio case confirmed in 2025,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/poliovirus-found-in-20-pakistani-districts-amid-rising-vaccine-refusals-new-sewage-data-signals-resurgence-13th-polio-case-confirmed-in-2025/articleshow/122421011.cms,"



Pakistan's battle against polio has hit a fresh setback, with the deadly virus detected in sewage samples across 20 districts, including the capital, just as the country grapples with rising vaccine refusal rates.According to ARY News, citing the National Reference Laboratory, 28 sewage samples collected between May 8 and June 17 tested positive for Wild Poliovirus Type 1 (WPV1). The presence of the virus was confirmed in major urban centres such as Lahore, Karachi, and Islamabad, as well as in districts across Sindh, Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir.Sindh reported the highest contamination, with 14 positive samples from 10 districts. Lahore recorded three cases, while Islamabad and four districts in KP also registered positive samples. In Balochistan, the virus was found in Mastung, Khuzdar, and Sibi. Mirpur in PoJK also showed signs of the virus.This alarming development follows Pakistan’s second national polio vaccination drive earlier this year, which saw over 60,000 refusals, 39,000 of them in Karachi alone. These refusals, officials say, are now posing a major roadblock to the country’s eradication efforts.“We’re not just fighting a virus; we’re battling misinformation and mistrust,” a senior health official told ARY News.Pakistan remains one of only two countries where polio is still endemic, the other being Afghanistan. With the confirmation of another new case this week, the total number of polio cases in the country has reached 13 so far in 2025.Health experts warn that the virus spreads primarily through contaminated water or food and can cause paralysis or death. There is no cure for polio, making vaccination the only defense.

Pakistan’s economic performance under the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) $7 billion loan programme has been “strong so far”, according to Mahir Binici, the IMF’s Resident Representative for Pakistan, reported PTI.Speaking at a lecture hosted by the Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI) in Islamabad on Sunday, Binici said Pakistan’s first review under the three-year Extended Fund Facility (EFF), approved in July 2024, was successfully completed by the IMF Executive Board in May.The EFF aims to cement macroeconomic stability and lay the groundwork for “stronger, more inclusive and resilient growth,” he said. So far, Pakistan has received two instalments under the programme, with the government implementing agreed policy measures aimed at fiscal discipline and investor confidence.“Early policy measures have helped restore macroeconomic stability and rebuild investor confidence, despite persistent external challenges,” Binici noted.He stressed the importance of structural reforms to ensure long-term economic sustainability, including strengthening tax equity, improving the business climate, and encouraging private-sector-led investment.Binici also welcomed Pakistan’s commitment to climate-related reforms under the $1.3 billion Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF), approved in March.The RSF supports projects focused on disaster preparedness, efficient water use, green investments, and better climate data transparency.“Support through the RSF will not only strengthen Pakistan’s climate resilience but also help unlock green investments and foster a more climate-conscious economic trajectory,” he said.On regional prospects, Binici said economic growth in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, including Pakistan, was expected to improve in 2025 and beyond. However, he warned that global economic uncertainty remains high due to trade tensions, geopolitical fragmentation, and weakening cooperation.","Pakistan's economic performance under IMF's $7 billion loan programme has been'strong so far' Mahir Binici, the IMF’s Resident Representative for Pakistan, spoke at a lecture in Islamabad.

India Lost 1 Rafale Jet During Op Sindoor, But Pakistan Did Not Do It: Dassault CEO's Fresh Claim

Poll Should passengers receive more training on recognizing flight details? Yes, it’s important No, it's the airline's job





In a major goof-up, a Pakistani airline flew a passenger to Jeddah in Saudi Arabia instead of Karachi, his actual destination.Shahzain, the affected passenger, alleged that he was not informed that he had boarded the wrong flight despite showing his ticket to the air hostess, ARY News reported.The passenger had to travel from Lahore, Pakistan's second-largest city, to Karachi, the largest.According to Shahzain, two planes were parked at Lahore airport's domestic terminal gate, and he was not aware of the mistake until it was too late.He has now sent a legal notice to the carrier, accusing it of causing him distress by its negligence.He demanded that the airline cover the additional travel expenses he incurred. He also sought compensation for the inconvenience and trouble he faced.Additionally, Shahzain confirmed he did not have a passport or visa for international travel.Two hours into the flight, I questioned why the plane had not yet reached Karachi.

DHAKA: In yet another development showcasing growing social intolerance in Bangladesh, the ancestral home of iconic filmmaker Satyajit Ray in Dhaka is being demolished to make way for a new semi-concrete structure, the local media reported Tuesday.Located on Horikishore Ray Chowdhury Road in the city, the century-old house was home to Upendrakishore Ray Chowdhury. Upendrakishore, a prominent 19th-century litterateur in his own right besides being a painter and publisher, was the father of celebrated poet Sukumar Ray and grandfather of filmmaker Satyajit Ray.A semi-concrete structure with several rooms will be built to house a Shishu Academy at the historically-significant building, the country's leading media outlet 'Daily Star' reported. According to reports, the property - which was built by Upendrakishore more than a century ago and previously housed the Mymensingh Shishu Academy - fell into a state of disrepair after years of neglect by the authorities.The newspaper said that local residents have expressed their concerns over the decision, citing that the demolition will wipe out the legacy of the Ray dynasty in Mymensingh city.

LONDON: The debate over whether there should be a Sikh regiment in the British armed forces has resurfaced but the ministry of defence (MoD) insists there are no such plans.The debate was triggered after Lord Sahota asked defence minister Lord Coaker in the House of Lords on July 7 whether there was any progress on having a Sikh regiment in the British Army, given the loyalty of Sikh soldiers in both world wars. Coaker replied, “Let me consider that request from my noble friend. I am quite happy to meet him to see what more we can do to recognise the contribution of soldiers such as Sikhs.” This led to UK headlines such as “Minister open to British Army Sikh regiment proposal”.But MoD sources told TOI: “Over the years there have been conversations about this, but it would breach Britain’s anti-discriminatory laws. There are no current plans for a Sikh regiment as it goes against the Equality Act. We want to do something to recognise Sikh contributions in some way, but not through a Sikh regiment.”Lord Sahota, whose grandfathers served in the British Indian army, including the 15th Punjab Regiment, told TOI: “I don’t think it would go against the Equality Act.” He pointed out the British Army has had the Staffordshire regiment and currently has the Brigade of Gurkhas, the Royal Yorkshire Regiment, Royal Welsh and Royal Regiment of Scotland and so on.“Itdoesn’t mean other faiths like Hindus, Muslim or Christians wouldn’t be able to serve in a Sikh regiment. If you are in the Royal Regiment of Scotland, it doesn’t mean you have to be Scottish.”.“We are struggling to recruit ethnic minorities in this country,” he said, and so having a Sikh Regiment would give Sikhs a “reason to join.” “They would wear turbans and have beards and it would reflect Sikh heritage and values,” he said.“It would foster a better relationship with other countries such as India and South Asia as well,” he added.There are estimated to be only 200 Sikhs in the British Armed Forces currently.“People tend to go in the army if their grandfather was in it. Sikhs don’t have that role model here,” Sahota said. He said if there was a Punjab or Sikh Regiment they would have that role model. “There are more than 700k Sikhs in the UK. I am sure quite a few would be prepared to follow in their great grandfather’s footsteps. King Charles even told a Sikh soldier he wanted to see more Sikhs in the British Army,” the Labour life peer added.", debate over whether there should be a Sikh regiment in the British armed forces has resurfaced.

The British government announced Thursday plans to lower the voting age for general elections from 18 to 16, making the UK one of the countries with the youngest voting ages worldwide. This change follows the Labour Party’s pledge ahead of last year’s election and is part of a broader package of electoral reforms aimed at modernizing the democratic process amid concerns over low voter turnout.Prime Minister Keir Starmer emphasized the rationale behind the decision, “I think it’s really important that 16- and 17-year-olds have the vote, because they are old enough to go out to work, they are old enough to pay taxes, so (they) pay in. And I think if you pay in, you should have the opportunity to say what you want your money spent on, which way the government should go.”The government will introduce legislation to parliament to formalize the change, and with its current majority, the bill is expected to pass. However, the move is likely to spark debate, with critics arguing it may benefit Labour, as younger voters are perceived to lean more center-left.Currently, only a handful of countries, including Austria, Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador, and Cuba, allow 16-year-olds to vote in national elections. The UK’s decision aligns the general election voting age with existing regional elections in Scotland and Wales, where 16-year-olds already have the franchise.Additional reforms include automated voter registration, already used in countries like Australia and Canada, and acceptance of UK-issued bank cards as valid identification at polling stations. These changes come after the previous Conservative government’s introduction of mandatory photo ID, which the Electoral Commission said may have prevented about 750,000 people from voting in the last election.Harry Quilter-Pinner, executive director of the Institute for Public Policy Research, described the reforms as “the biggest reform to our electoral system since 1969,” when the voting age was first lowered to 18. He estimated that the combined changes could add 9.5 million voters to the rolls, addressing the current crisis of declining democratic engagement.“Our democracy is in crisis, and we risk reaching a tipping point where politics loses its legitimacy,” Quilter-Pinner warned, supporting the government’s plans.",The UK government announced Thursday plans to lower the voting age for general elections from 18 to 16.

‘Baseless...': Pilot Body Slaps Legal Notice on WSJ,Reuters Over Air India Crash Reports





LONDON: Pilots should be filmed in the cockpit so that accidents can be investigated properly, International Air Transport Association (IATA) director-general Willie Walsh has said.“I can see there is a strong argument now for the inclusion of video in the cockpit to assist in accident investigations,” Walsh said in his first remarks since the release of the preliminary investigation report on the June 12 Air India Boeing 787 Dreamliner crash.“We believe that any major incident or accident that takes place needs to be investigated fully and properly and reported so that everyone can benefit. Based on what little we know now, it is quite possible that a video recording in addition to the voice recording, would significantly assist the investigators conducting [the Air India] investigation,” Walsh, former chief executive of British Airways, said in Singapore on Wednesday.“Videos are becoming important now as there have been so many crashes over the past few years,” a retired Boeing pilot captain who flew 737s internationally told TOI. “A video recording would answer all the questions about the Air India crash… People need answers.”Pilots' unions are worried about privacy breaches and the videos being misused. President of the largest airline pilot union in the world, the Air Line Pilots Association, Int’l (ALPA), Capt Jason Ambrosi, told TOI: “ALPA has long recommended that any additional resources should be focused on enhancing current safety systems to record more data of a higher quality and improve pilot situational awareness by deploying readily available technology, like ADS-B in equipage, to prevent accidents, as opposed to video images, which are subject to misinterpretation and may lead investigators away from accurate conclusions.Flight deck image recorders will not improve safety and could impede it by diverting limited resources that could be used for more valuable safety enhancements. ALPA remains equally concerned as to how such proposed video recordings may be misused.”In 2000, US National Transportation Safety Board chairman Jim Hall had urged the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to require all commercial US airliners to be equipped with cockpit video recorders.An FAA spokesperson told TOI, “The FAA formed an Aviation Rulemaking Committee in Sept 2023 to provide suggestions for addressing these recommendations.
