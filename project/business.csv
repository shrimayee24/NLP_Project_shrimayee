American beverage giants Pepsi and Coca-Cola maintain a strong retail presence, whilst Apple stores and Starbucks outlets continue to attract substantial customer interest.The implementation of a 50% tariff on Indian goods by Donald Trump has strained diplomatic relations between New Delhi and Washington, leading to widespread social media campaigns and public calls to support local alternatives over American products.

India Makes Stunning Russia Oil Move In Response To Trump Sanctions Threat | Details

EU sanctions impact on Nayara Energy

Sanctions fallout

History of Nayara Energy

Nayara Energy’s focus on domestic market

Nayara Energy, the Russia-backed Indian refinery, is facing a perfect storm - hit by European Union sanctions, the company currently faces multiple challenges! These include disrupted global shipping, domestic regulatory constraints, changes in leadership and concerns regarding digital infrastructure.For Nayara Energy, which is responsible for approximately 8% of India's refining capacity and 7% of its retail fuel station network, these difficulties are testing both the company's adaptability and its future planning.Nayara Energy operates India's second-largest private refinery, alongside its oil storage terminal, port facilities, infrastructure and a network exceeding 6,000 petrol stations, according to an ET report.Its ambitious growth trajectory now faces significant uncertainty.On July 18, the EU implemented its 18th sanctions package against Russia, with restrictions on fuel imports refined from Russian crude, reducing the Russian oil price cap to $47.6 per barrel from $60 and addressing the shadow fleet involved in transportation.The price cap becomes effective September 3. Additionally, US President Donald Trump has imposed 50% duties on Indian imports, alleging India's support for Moscow's Ukrainian campaign through oil purchases.Also Read | Donald Trump tariffs: How much will India’s fuel bill rise if it stops Russian crude oil imports & where would it buy from? Explained Despite avoiding direct sanctions, Nayara's substantial Russian ownership has resulted in progressive complications.Shortly after the latest EU sanctions were implemented, Alessandro Des Dorides stepped down as Nayara Energy's chief executive, with Sergey Denisov, a company veteran since 2017, taking the helm.On July 28, Nayara Energy faced a significant challenge when Microsoft blocked their access to data, tools and products, despite having valid paid licences. Although services were restored following legal action by Nayara, the incident highlighted the gravity of their situation.A trader with knowledge of the situation was quoted as saying, ""Nayara's troubles have just begun. It is not only barred from exporting refined products to Europe, but fearing penalties, shipping companies are pulling back from transporting its products. Insurers and trade finance providers are wary."" The source indicated this has limited the company's ability to service export markets in Europe, Southeast Asia and parts of Africa.According to Care Ratings' July assessment, exports represented 25-30% of Nayara's total revenue, with domestic Indian sales accounting for the remainder. Despite minimal direct EU exports, with most international sales occurring through traders serving various markets, Nayara is actively seeking alternative payment arrangements as EU sanctions loom. Reports suggest the company is looking to partner with a local bank to handle crude oil import payments and receive funds for refined fuel exports.Under the weight of sanctions, Rosneft has been unable to transfer profits from Nayara Energy in recent years. According to informed sources, this inability to move earnings from the company is considered a primary factor in its consideration to divest the Indian operation.The recent wave of sanctions has created additional obstacles to this process. Discussions have occurred with Indian business groups, with valuations exceeding $20 billion.In a parallel development, UCP Investment Group, a prominent Russian financial investment organisation, seeks to dispose of its Nayara Energy holding for more than $5 billion. This follows Trafigura's divestment of its 24.5% ownership to Hara Capital Sarl, a fully-owned subsidiary of Italian energy investment company Mareterra Group Holding, in January 2023. Industry experts suggest that sanctions could reduce Nayara's market value, potentially making it an appealing prospect for international investors.In August 2017, following the acquisition of Essar Oil's 20-mtpa Vadinar refinery (Gujarat) by a Rosneft-led consortium, the entity was rebranded as Nayara Energy. The name combines 'Naya' (Hindi for new) and 'Era', reflecting the shareholders' aspirations for the asset's future development.The establishment of Nayara coincided with significant reforms in India's petroleum sector, where the government's deregulation of fuel retail prices created equal opportunities for private retailers like Nayara to expand their network, according to the ET report.This liberalisation caused considerable anxiety among state-operated oil marketing companies, which had previously maintained a stronghold over fuel retailing. Their primary concern was the potential loss of market share to private entities such as Nayara and Reliance Industries, the report said.Also Read | India-US trade deal: With Donald Trump’s 50% tariffs looming, India reviews market access offers for US; three-pronged strategy to protect exporters Nayara has seen steady growth until it encountered difficulties from sanctions imposed by the United States and EU, aimed at targeting Russia following its Ukraine war. The company's oil and energy revenue has become particularly vulnerable.The acquisition of the Essar facility by Russia's state energy corporation and an international investor consortium comprising Trafigura and UCP Investment Group was valued at $12.9 billion. This represented Rosneft's most substantial overseas investment in India's refining industry, securing access to one of the world's rapidly expanding markets.Nayara Energy has been compelled to focus on domestic markets due to international constraints. Recently, the company approached government-owned refineries, proposing to sell them its export-designated petrol and diesel quantities to avoid stockpiling.The shift towards domestic sales provides temporary respite but affects profitability. European markets traditionally yielded higher returns compared to domestic sales. Competition within India, particularly from government-owned fuel retailers, restricts pricing autonomy and adaptability.Also Read | Explainer: Donald Trump’s 50% tariffs - will India budge on Russia crude oil trade? This situation emerged precisely when Nayara Energy was preparing for substantial expansion. The company had declared intentions to invest more than ₹70,000 crore in various sectors including petrochemicals, ethanol production facilities and retail infrastructure development. Since August 2017, it had already invested over ₹14,000 crore in Indian projects, encompassing refinery upgrades, a petrochemical facility and infrastructure developments.The sanctions now threaten to disrupt technical assistance from European technology providers, essential for refinery operations. The critical consideration remains whether Nayara can maintain its diversification strategy while its primary refining-export operations face challenges under western restrictions.","Nayara Energy operates India's second-largest private refinery, alongside its oil storage terminal, port facilities, infrastructure and a network exceeding 6,000 petrol stations.

Here is what happened during the hearing

Senior advocate Kapil Sibal , appearing for RJD MP Manoj Jha, said that the exclusion of about 65 lakh voters from the draft electoral roll published on August 1 is illegal.

, appearing for RJD MP Manoj Jha, said that the exclusion of about 65 lakh voters from the draft electoral roll published on August 1 is illegal. However, the top court said that as per the rules, the persons excluded have to submit applications for inclusion, and it is only at this stage that anyone's objection will be considered.

Sibal argued that most of the population of Bihar does not posses the documents specified by the ECI as acceptable. “Bihar people don't have these documents, that's the point.”

Justice Kant said it was a “very sweeping argument” to suggest no one in Bihar possessed valid documents, noting Aadhaar and ration cards existed but could not be treated as definitive proof.

“Bihar is part of India. If they don't have them, other states won't either,” the top court said. “There must be something to prove you are a citizen of India… everybody possesses some certificate - you need it even to buy a SIM. OBC, SC, ST certificates.""

Advocate Prashant Bhushan, appearing for Association for Democratic Reforms, said that the poll body not published a list of names of the 65 lakh persons who have been deleted from the draft roll. He also accused the EC of not specifying who are dead or migrated persons.

""Today, what they have done is something mischievous. Till the 4th of August, the draft of the roll was searchable. After the 4th of August, the document is not searchable. They say, go and ask the Booth Level Agent of the political party. Why should I, as a citizen, not know from their document and should ask an agent of the political party?"" Bhushan said.

Meanwhile, appearing for the EC, senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi said an exercise of this nature was “bound to have some defects”, but errors could be corrected before the final roll is published on 30 September. Opposition leaders and civil society groups have petitioned against the EC’s June 24 decision.

Senior Advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi said ""You cannot start by presumptively doubting the citizenship of 5 crore of voters (who are in the post-2003 roll). The presumption is that they are citizens unless established otherwise through a procedure in accordance with the law....If you declare 5 crore people to be not valid and give them 2.5 months.""

Political activist Yogendra Yadav, who addressed the court in person, questioned the data given by the poll panel and said instead of 7.9 crore voters there was total adult population of 8.18 crore and the design of SIR exercise was to delete the voters. ""They (EC) were not able to find any individual whose name was added and the booth level officers visited house to house for deletion of names,"" Yadav said, calling it a case of ""total disenfranchisement"".

'Who Runs the House, You or Amit Shah?' Kharge Attacks Speaker In Rajya Sabha, Rijiju Responds

Prominent leaders of different parties, including Union ministers Amit Shah and J P Nadda of the BJP and Sonia Gandhi and Mallikarjun Kharge of the Congress, voted on Tuesday in the keenly contested Constitution Club of India polls, as two seasoned ruling party members slug it out for a key position.Incumbent Secretary (Administration) Rajiv Pratap Rudy , a fifth-term Lok Sabha MP, is facing a spirited challenge to his nearly 25 years at the helm from fellow BJP leader Sanjeev Balyan , a two-term former Lok Sabha MP.Over 690 votes were cast out of the total electors of 1,295 current and former MPs, officials said, making it one of the highest turnouts for the election to the club's office-bearers.Rudy had a slight lead over Balyan after initial rounds, with results expected to be out late in the night.Several Union ministers, including Piyush Goyal and Kiren Rijiju, and governors like Shiv Pratap Shukla of Himachal Pradesh, voted as contestants lobbied intensively to rally their supporters.Rudy has been a dominant presence, winning several elections uncontested, before Baliyan, spurred by the support from some BJP leaders with Lok Sabha MP Nishikant Dubey being the most visible campaigner, decided to test the Bihar leader's strength.The elections include 14 members vying for the position of 11 executive members.Both former Union ministers, Rudy and Baliyan, may be from the same party but present two contrasting personalities drawn from different social milieus.Rudy, a commercial pilot, is a suave and polished leader who is at home with social elites, mixing his urbane personality effortlessly with his background as a savvy parliamentarian who has got the better of the likes of Rabri Devi and her daughter Rohini Acharya in Lok Sabha elections from Saran.Baliyan, who is from western Uttar Pradesh, is a representative of rural sensibilities and grassroots ruggedness.

NEW DELHI: In a relief to owners facing the threat of their overage vehicles being impounded by city authorities, Supreme Court Tuesday directed no coercive action be taken against them and agreed to re-examine its 2018 order by which it had banned the plying of over 15-year-old petrol and 10-year-old diesel vehicles.The respite came after SG Tushar Mehta and additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati, appearing for Delhi govt, appealed to a three-judge bench led by CJI Gavai to recall the order on the grounds it was causing hardships to citizens of Delhi and that pollution, contrary to assumption, is not directly related to the age of vehicles due to advancements in technology and use of BS VI emission norm.Also read: Delhi govt requests SC to review 2018 blanket ban affecting middle class the most In its application, govt said there was a need for a graded, balanced and technology-driven regime to handle vehicular pollution, and that instead of an age-based blanket ban, a scientific and data-driven framework should be developed that considers all relevant indicators to ascertain pollution by individual vehicles. It submitted such a policy would ensure not only the protection of the environment through the phasing out of polluting vehicles but also preserve the rights of responsible vehicle owners.A senior citizen and owner of a 2011 BMW car, apprehending impounding of his vehicle, also moved the court and his lawyer Charu Mathur contended that a complete ban on vehicles based on their age rather than fitness or compliance with emission norms was wrong and needed to be examined.The bench, also comprising Justices K Vinod Chandran and N V Anjaria, after a brief hearing, agreed to examine their plea. ""Issue notice. Returnable in four weeks. In the meantime no coercive steps should be taken against the owners of (such) vehicles on the ground... List it after four weeks,"" it said.The 2018 SC order was not vigorously implemented by authorities and was done only last year, which led to public outcry, following which the drive to impound the vehicles was halted. This compelled govt to seek recall of the SC order.The govt in its application said, ""It is submitted that if the order of this court dated 29.10.2018 continues to operate, it will result in road worthy, non-polluting BS-VI vehicles also going off the roads in a matter of a few years without a scientific basis for the same. Further, it is respectfully submitted that there does not appear to be a scientific basis for mandating that even BS-IV vehicles which meet PUC norms should be taken off the roads in Delhi NCR. It is submitted that these are serious issues which may require a fresh scientific evaluation"".""It is respectfully submitted that the order passed by this court was originally passed as an emergency measure during a period when BS-IV emission standards were in force and the migration to BS-VI, which has much stricter and advanced norms, had not yet commenced,"" the govt said. ""However, it is submitted that to tackle the issue of pollution in NCR, a comprehensive policy is required which gives vehicle fitness based on the actual emission levels of an individual vehicle as per scientific methods rather than implementing a blanket ban based solely on the age of the vehicle,"" it said.",Supreme Court agrees to re-examine its 2018 order by which it had banned the plying of over 15-year-old petrol and 10- year-old diesel vehicles.

1 of every 3 faculty posts vacant across 20 AIIMS



NEW DELHI: There is an exodus of doctors from All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) across the country, with as many as 429 resigning from 20 institutes from 2022 to 2024, data shared by the govt with Parliament has revealed. The govt was responding to a question on doctors leaving AIIMS for private jobs.The data showed the maximum number of doctors - 52 - resigned from AIIMS Delhi, which is the parent institution and the most prestigious of all AIIMS. It was followed by 38 resignations at AIIMS Rishikesh, 35 at AIIMS Raipur, 32 at AIIMS Bilaspur and 30 at AIIMS Mangalagiri. The resignations have come at a time when most AIIMS are struggling with a faculty/doctor crisis.Nearly one out of every three faculty positions was lying vacant across all 20 AIIMS, including Delhi AIIMS, the data showed. Recently, the govt told Parliament in response to another question that provision has been made for hiring on contract basis of retired faculty members - from Institutes of National Importance and govt medical colleges - at the level of professor, additional professor and associate professor in new AIIMS, up to 70 years.In addition to this, the govt said, a visiting faculty scheme has been formulated to allow professors, additional professors and associate professors who are holding academic positions in govt institutions within India or academic institutions outside India, to be visiting faculty in new AIIMS for teaching purposes. However, doctors say further action is needed to stop the brain drain.AIIMS Delhi has 1,306 sanctioned faculty positions. Of these, 462 (35%) are vacant. AIIMS Bhopal has 71 (23%) vacant faculty positions, while AIIMS Bhubaneswar has 103 (31%) vacant positions. The percentage of vacant faculty positions in other AIIMS also ranges between 20% and 35%.Many non-faculty positions, including those of nurses, OT technicians and other crucial staff are also lying vacant."" over the last few years, focus has shifted towards improving the services and often we receive complaints about the lack of 'protected time' to carry out research, which is an important reason for the brain drain,"" a senior doctor from AIIMS who recently joined the private sector said.The senior doctor added that salaries in the private sector are four to 10 times the salary offered at AIIMS.","There is an exodus of doctors from All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) across the country.

Their caution, sent in a letter on Tuesday to Union ministry of road transport and highways, came days after the Aug 5 flood in Dharali brought down massive debris from glacier-fed streams, washing away homes.Senior geologist Navin Juyal and environmentalist Hemant Dhyani, both members of the scrutiny committee for the Bhagirathi eco-sensitive zone's zonal master plan, had submitted a detailed report in Oct 2023 as sought by MoRTH. That survey mapped the upper Bhagirathi valley's most unstable slopes and proposed an alternate design that they said could keep the road functional without undermining slope stability. Juyal, a former senior scientist at Physical Research Laboratory in Ahmedabad, has since resigned from the high-powered committee overseeing the Char Dham project; Dhyani remains on it.The Aug 5 flood played out almost exactly as they had predicted.At Dharali, one cirque stream burst through, dragging tons of rock and soil into the valley. In Bhatwari, a highway stretch almost sunk - in a zone they had documented as sinking 12mm to 22mm annually. In their latest note, the experts urged adoption of alternate DPR design as given in Oct 2023 report and full enforcement of the Bhagirathi eco-sensitive zone notification. They also backed extending eco-sensitive protections across the higher Himalayan valleys. ""The Char Dham road widening project in its current form in BESZ will spell disaster otherwise,"" Dhyani said. Pankaj Singh, head of the ministry's Dehradun office, said work was under way in line with SC directions and the Oct 2023 report.","Two members of an SC-appointed committee have warned the Char Dham all-weather road widening project will cause disaster in the fragile Himalayan terrain.

Poll Can AI help solve Japan’s population decline issue? No, social policies and reforms are more important Yes, AI can support and ease the impact

Why this didn’t start yesterday: deep causes of Japan’s demographic decline



Japan’s demographic trajectory is the result of multiple, long-running structural factors:

Low fertility: decades of fertility rates below the replacement level (≈2.1 children per woman), driven by economic insecurity, high housing and childcare costs, and changing social norms.

Rapid ageing: a large baby-boom cohort moving into retirement combined with high life expectancy.

Delay or avoidance of marriage/childbearing: many younger adults delay relationships or choose smaller families for economic and lifestyle reasons.

Labour and gender dynamics: persistent workplace expectations and limited family-friendly policies historically constrained people’s ability to combine work and childrearing.

How Elon Musk views Japan’s demographic decline



Family support policies: targeted childcare, affordable early-education, paid parental leave and housing incentives.

Gender-equal labour reforms: flexible work, stronger protections for working parents, and removing career penalties for caregiving.

Immigration and integration policies: addressing immediate labour shortages while building social cohesion.

Automation and AI deployment: sensible use of technology to raise productivity and ease elderly care burdens — but paired with social policy to support families.

Cultural and economic measures: tackling job insecurity, precarious work, and the high cost of raising children in expensive cities.

GTA 6 release date confirmed with exciting new gameplay



GTA 6 pricing: The rising cost of AAA games



GTA-6 features fans are buzzing



A larger, more detailed map with over a dozen new areas, including the possibility of returning to Liberty City.

New gameplay mechanics like a “love meter” system and an in-game social media platform to enhance immersion.

A campaign length estimated at 75 hours, more than twice that of GTA 5’s story mode, providing players with deeper narrative and exploration opportunities.

GTA 6 boosts Take-Two’s Q2 2025 earnings and future growth outlook

Rockstar Games ’ Grand Theft Auto 6 (GTA 6) remains one of the most anticipated video game releases globally. Earlier in 2025, Rockstar unveiled the game’s second official trailer alongside a confirmed release date of May 26, 2026. This announcement thrilled fans but also raised cautious optimism due to Rockstar’s reputation for pushing back major game launches. Originally planned for 2025, questions linger about whether this new date will hold, especially considering the high expectations for innovative gameplay and cutting-edge graphics.The hype around GTA 6 continues to build as Rockstar reveals more details and approaches its projected 2026 release. While fans eagerly await the game, the cautious optimism around timing and pricing reflects the realities of AAA game development in today’s market.Grand Theft Auto 6 is shaping up to redefine open-world gaming once again, but patience will be key as the release date approaches.Rockstar Games is known for its meticulous development process. The company prioritizes delivering polished, expansive gaming experiences over strict adherence to release schedules. This approach often leads to delays, as seen with previous hits like Red Dead Redemption 2 and GTA 5. These delays, while frustrating for fans, usually result in critically acclaimed, technically impressive games that push the boundaries of open-world design and storytelling innovation, enhancing player immersion and long-term engagement.Take-Two Interactive, Rockstar’s parent company, confirmed in their most recent earnings report that GTA 6 is still on track for its May 26, 2026 launch. This is positive news amid speculation about possible delays, fueled by Rockstar’s history of postponing flagship titles.However, previous earnings calls from Take-Two indicated a 2025 release, which didn’t come to fruition, so this confirmation remains tentative. Fans should remain cautiously hopeful but prepared for potential shifts in the timeline.One major uncertainty surrounding GTA 6 is its pricing structure. With the gaming industry trending towards higher launch prices—Nintendo has already introduced $80 titles—there’s widespread speculation that Take-Two might follow suit. Given GTA 6’s reportedly massive budget and scale, an $80 price tag or higher is plausible, as reported.Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick told Variety that their goal is to “deliver more value than what we charge.” This suggests the company plans to justify premium pricing through quality content and added value, possibly with deluxe editions and special bonuses. Unofficial leaks hint at regional standard edition prices ranging from Rs 5,999 in India to $70 in the US, while deluxe editions could cost up to $125 in some markets.Rockstar promises GTA 6 will significantly expand upon the series’ signature open-world crime gameplay. The new installment follows protagonists Jason and Lucia in a Bonnie and Clyde-inspired storyline, set primarily in Leonida—a fictional state modeled after Florida, with Vice City at its core.The game will feature:Take-Two’s Q2 2025 earnings report showcased robust performance, with net bookings reaching $1.42 billion and total revenue of $1.5 billion, driven by existing franchises like NBA 2K25 and GTA Online. This strong financial footing allows Take-Two to invest heavily in GTA 6’s development and marketing.This investment underscores the company’s commitment to making GTA 6 a groundbreaking release that meets fan expectations for quality and innovation. Furthermore, successful launch and reception of GTA 6 could redefine market standards for AAA open-world titles moving forward.The company has also raised its full-year net bookings projection for fiscal 2026 to between $6.05 billion and $6.15 billion, reflecting confidence that GTA 6, alongside other titles like Mafia: The Old Country and Borderlands 4, will drive substantial sales. While GTA 6’s confirmed release date offers hope, fans should remain prepared for potential delays, given Rockstar’s history. Pricing will likely reflect recent industry trends toward premium game costs, but Take-Two’s promise of delivering value could soften that impact.With a bigger world, innovative gameplay, and a compelling dual-protagonist story, GTA 6 promises to be a milestone in open-world gaming. Players can expect a richly detailed experience that pushes the boundaries of the genre. Excitement continues to build as fans eagerly count down the days until the game’s highly anticipated launch in 2026.","Grand Theft Auto 6 is shaping up to redefine open-world gaming once again.

Apple’s next iPhone release, the iPhone 17 series , could mark a notable shift—for the first time in years, consumers may see higher prices at launch. Analyst Jeff Pu from GF Securities reports that US tariffs on devices from China and India could push prices up by $50 to $100 compared to the iPhone 16 models. At the same time, Apple may increase the base storage on the Pro model to 256GB, adding more value behind the higher price. As September approaches, buyers and analysts are watching closely. The coming decisions will influence not only budgets but also the broader discussion around trade, manufacturing, and consumer expectations in the tech world.According to MacRumors, market projections suggest that at least some iPhone 17 models will cost between $50 and $100 more than their predecessors. This would be the first price increase for the Pro model since the iPhone X in 2017.One way Apple may lessen the sting is by increasing the minimum storage on the Pro model from 128GB to 256GB. This aligns with existing practices and can help justify a higher base price with a tangible upgrade.According to Jeff Pu, new US tariffs on products imported from iPhone assembly hubs like China and India are expected to raise production costs. While imports from China carry a 20% tariff, devices made in India are currently exempt. However, since Apple now brings most of its US-sold iPhones from India, these cost pressures still affect pricing decisions. The unpredictable nature of US trade policy adds another layer of uncertainty to Apple’s cost structure. Still, Apple fans remain eager to see what innovations the new iPhone 17 will bring despite potential price changes.Apple is expected to launch the iPhone 17 lineup, including standard, Pro, Pro Max, and possibly an “Air” or “Slim” model, on September 9, 2025. Pre-orders may begin on September 12, with shipments and retail availability starting September 19.Potential starting prices based on recent leaks:According to Business Insider, Apple’s Q3 earnings report revealed $94 billion in revenue, supported by strong iPhone sales. Despite this, the company incurred $800 million in tariff costs, expected to rise to $1.1 billion next quarter. Analysts warn that continued cost challenges may force Apple to raise prices more broadly, not just in the US, potentially affecting global retail pricing strategies.","Apple is expected to launch the iPhone 17 lineup, including standard, Pro, Pro Max, and possibly an “Air” or “Slim” model, on September 9, 2025.

Maneesh Sharma, AVP - Commodities & Currencies, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers shares his views and recommendations for gold investors:

Gold Price Outlook

Gold Weekly View: Volatile

MCX Trading range (Oct Futures): Rs 99,200 – 1,01,600/10 gms. (CMP Rs 1,00,215/10 gm)

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

Gold price prediction today: Upside in gold rates is expected to be limited with the US-China 90-day trade truce extended and other developments on the Trump trade war front.Gold prices turned volatile as a surge seen on Friday on COMEX on news of possible tariffs on imports of one-kilogram gold bars in Switzerland, threatened more turmoil in the global bullion market. But prices retreated quickly from those record highs in the current week following the White House’s announcement to address “misinformation” surrounding potential import tariffs on gold bars. The move came amid confusion in the precious metals industry and fears that a key segment of global bullion trade could be disrupted.Additionally US & China confirmed a 90-day extension of their trade truce this week, after several rounds of “productive” negotiation. Developments in US-China trade negotiations generally trended in a positive direction in recent weeks. But recent history proved trade developments can remain prolonged this year. Moving ahead trade developments in US - India remains to be watched out while on the macro front Inflationary numbers (PPI) from India & US due remain crucial to be watched to gauge trajectory of interest rate cuts in coming months.Gold seemed to lack bullish conviction during the start of the week as traders also opted to wait for the release of the US consumer inflation figures.This crucial data earlier had played a key role in influencing expectations about the Federal Reserve's (Fed) rate-cut path. Heading into the key data risk ahead, the growing acceptance that the US central bank will lower borrowing costs in September kept the USD bulls on the defensive during the start of the week. Meanwhile traders continue to price in more than 90% possibility of a 25 bps rate cut in September.Overall the latest optimism over an extension of the US-China trade truce and the US-Russia summit aimed at ending the war in Ukraine could cap the safe-haven pair major upside warranting some caution as Spot Gold could continue to find resistance in the zone of $ 3,385 – 3,410 per oz (CMP USD 3,350/oz) on the higher side.After the release of US CPI report which remains lighter than expected not enough to provide clarity on impact of higher tariffs despite slight rise in Core CPI numbers, attention could now also shift towards Producer Price Index (PPI) report (more closely followed by US Fed) due on Thursday, along with Retail Sales & the preliminary August reading of the Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index. These figures would be closely watched further while gold prices could witness increased volatility towards the end of the week.","Spot Gold could continue to find resistance in the zone of $ 3,385 – 3,410 per oz (CMP USD 3,350/oz) on the higher side.

Char Dham road plan ‘spells disaster’: Experts say Dharali flash flood validates warnings; press for slope-stable design,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/char-dham-road-plan-spells-disaster-experts-say-dharali-flash-flood-validates-warnings-press-for-slope-stable-design/articleshow/123271469.cms,"Flash flood played out almost exactly as experts had predicted

DEHRADUN: Two members of a SC-appointed committee have warned that the Char Dham all-weather road widening project in the Bhagirathi eco-sensitive zone (BESZ), if built as currently planned, will cause disaster in the fragile Himalayan terrain. Their caution, sent in a letter on Tuesday to the Union ministry of road transport and highways, came days after the Aug 5 flood in Dharali village brought down massive debris from glacier-fed streams, washing away homes.Senior geologist Navin Juyal and environmentalist Hemant Dhyani, both members of the scrutiny committee for the Bhagirathi eco-sensitive zone's zonal master plan, had submitted a detailed report about it in Oct 2023 as sought by MoRTH.The survey mapped the upper Bhagirathi valley's most unstable slopes and proposed an alternate design that they said could keep the road functional without undermining slope stability.Juyal, a former senior scientist at Physical Research Laboratory in Ahmedabad, has since resigned from the high-powered committee overseeing the Char Dham project; Dhyani remains on it.The Aug 5 flood played out almost exactly as they had predicted. At Dharali, one cirque stream burst through, dragging tons of rock and soil into the valley. In Bhatwari, a highway stretch almost sunk - in a zone they had documented as sinking 12mm to 22mm annually.In their latest note, the experts urged adoption of alternate DPR design as given in Oct 2023 report and full enforcement of the Bhagirathi eco-sensitive zone notification. They also backed extending eco-sensitive protections across the higher Himalayan valleys.The Char Dham road widening project in its current form in BESZ will spell disaster otherwise,"" Dhyani said. Pankaj Singh, head of the ministry's Dehradun office, said work was under way in line with SC directions and the Oct 2023 report.","Two members of a SC-appointed committee have warned that the Char Dham all- weather road widening project in the Bhagirathi eco-sensitive zone will cause disaster.

US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Tuesday said India has been headstrong in ongoing trade negotiations with Washington, describing New Delhi as “a bit recalcitrant.”His remarks came days after President Donald Trump announced an additional 25 per cent tariff on Indian imports, citing the country’s Russian oil purchases.Bessent said talks are continuing with some nations, specifically mentioning Switzerland and India, and expressed hope of concluding tariff discussions by October.

I think we’re in a good position.""On August 6, Trump authorised an executive order imposing the additional 25 per cent duty, bringing the total tariff on Indian goods to 50 per cent.

What is PMLA?

Key objectives of PMLA

Under this law, government agencies can take away property bought with dirty money. The Directorate of Enforcement leads investigations into these crimes. They can freeze assets linked to money laundering cases.

The law puts strict rules on banks and financial companies. They must carefully check who their customers are. They need to keep detailed records of transactions. If they spot anything suspicious, they must tell the Financial Intelligence Unit-India (FIU-IND) right away.

These measures help catch criminals who try to clean their illegal money through the banking system. The law makes sure that people can't easily hide their ill-gotten wealth by moving it through different accounts or buying expensive things.

The PMLA shows India's strong commitment to keeping its financial system clean. It helps stop criminals from using banks and other institutions to make their illegal money look legitimate.

Former India cricketer Suresh Raina is set to face questioning by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Wednesday morning regarding a money laundering case connected to illegal online betting platform 1XBet, where the agency suspects his involvement through endorsements.The ED plans to record Raina's statements under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) during his deposition.The agency's investigation focuses on understanding Raina's alleged connections to the betting app through certain endorsements.""These platforms are in violation of multiple laws and directions by the Indian government... It is estimated that around 22 crore (220 million) Indian users are currently engaged on various betting apps, and 11 crore (110 million) of these are regular users,"" an official told theReports indicate that illegal betting websites and apps recorded over 1.6 billion visits in the first three months of 2025. The online betting market in India is estimated to be worth around $100 million, with illegal betting apps allegedly evading tax worth Rs 27,000 crore annually.The ED had previously attached assets worth 337 crore in cases related to IPL cricket match betting last year.One significant case involves the online platform Fairplay, whose directors face accusations of illegal IPL cricket match broadcasting and online betting activities.""The attached assets include demat account holdings, lands, flats and commercial warehouses located at Ajmer (Rajasthan), Kutch (Gujarat), Daman, Thane & Mumbai (Maharashtra) are worth 219.66cr of the online betting app Fairplay and its promoters,"" the ED stated.India's Parliament introduced the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) in 2002 to fight financial crimes. This law helps catch people who try to make illegal money look legal. It gives authorities power to seize dirty money, requires banks to report suspicious activities, and punishes wrongdoers.The PMLA serves as India's main weapon against money laundering. It protects the country's financial system from criminals who try to hide their illegal earnings. The law works by stopping bad actors from converting their unlawful gains into legitimate assets.",Former India cricketer Suresh Raina is set to face questioning by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Wednesday morning regarding a money laundering case.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Stock market today: Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , the Indian equity benchmark indices, opened in green on Wednesday. While Nifty50 was above 24,550, BSE Sensex was up over 250 points. At 9:16 AM, Nifty50 was trading at 24,587.55, up 100 points or 0.41%. BSE Sensex was at 80,512.92, up 277 points or 0.35%.Market observers anticipate a period of consolidation, backed by domestic investment flows, whilst monitoring international developments regarding US tariffs and upcoming US-Russia diplomatic discussions later this week.VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited says, “The significant recent underperformance of the Indian market deserves a close look. Nifty has been setting new lows consecutively for the last six weeks while most other markets -developed and emerging- are doing well. This underperformance is despite the massive DII buying aided by robust inflows into mutual funds. In August, so far, FIIs have sold equity for Rs 18620 crores through the exchanges. This FII selling has been completely eclipsed by the massive DII buying of Rs 46272 crores. Yet Nifty has drifted down from 24768 to 24487.Why? Trump’s harsh tariffs and the straining of relations between US and India have impacted the market sentiments and, consequently, shorts have piled up pulling the market down. The tepid earnings growth, elevated valuations and modest projection of 8 to 10% earnings growth for FY26 have emboldened the bears to increase the short positions. A sudden reversal of sentiments can lead to short covering and sharp recovery in the market. The Trump-Putin talks may provide a positive trigger but there is no certainty about it.“This is the right time for asset allocation. Investors with a long-term investment horizon of 3 years and above can accumulate fairly valued largecaps in banking, telecom, capital goods, aviation and select midcap IT. The risk-reward in these segments is favourable for investment.""US markets largely improved on Tuesday, with indices reaching new peaks following inflation data that indicated minimal effects from President Donald Trump's tariffs. The S&P 500 increased by 1.1%, exceeding its previous record, whilst the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 483 points (1.1%). The Nasdaq Composite rose 1.4% to achieve a fresh peak.Asian equities index advanced 0.6%, supported by the Nikkei-225's new record in Japan. The US dollar remained stable following previous session losses. Treasury yields increased slightly with the 10-year rate reaching 4.30%.Oil prices stabilised on Wednesday, following Tuesday's decline, as industry reports indicated rising US crude stockpiles, suggesting the end of summer demand.Foreign portfolio investors sold shares worth Rs 3,398 crore net on Tuesday. Domestic institutional investors were net purchasers at Rs 3,508 crore.","Nifty50 was above 24,550, BSE Sensex was up over 250 points.
