""Duty hours of loco pilots are carefully monitored. Rest is provided meticulously after trips. The average duty hours are maintained within prescribed hours,"" he wrote.

'When ruler lacks self-confidence ... ': Tejashwi takes dig at Nitish



NEW DELHI: Bihar CM Nitish Kumar on Wednesday pleaded with a private company official to speed up a road project in the capital city Patna and even offered to touch his feet . His act evoked strong reaction from RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav who called him ""helpless.""(I shall touch your feet if that is what you want),"" Nitish Kumar said.As Nitish walked towards the official with folded hands, the official said, ""Sir please don't do this.""It came during an event where a section of the ""JP Ganga Path,"" an expressway built along the river to alleviate city traffic, was inaugurated for public use.This is not the first time that Bihar CM has made such a request.

'1986 Act cannot prevail over ...': What SC's big judgment says on alimony for Muslim women,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/1986-act-cannot-prevail-over-what-scs-big-judgment-says-on-alimony-for-muslim-women-section-125-crpc-maintenance-religion/articleshow/111633619.cms,"What the court said:

Section 125 CrPC, which deals with a wife's legal right to maintenance, covers Muslim women as well

Maintenance is a right of married women, not charity, and applies to all married women regardless of religion

The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986 will not prevail over the secular and religion neutral provision of Section 125 of CrPC, a bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and Augustine George Masih said

The court highlighted the necessity for husbands to provide financial support to their wives, and suggested practical measures such as maintaining joint bank accounts and sharing ATM access to ensure economic stability for women within the household

If a Muslim woman is divorced during the pendency of a Section 125 CrPC petition, she can take recourse to the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019, in addition to continuing the Section 125 petition.

The court dismissed an appeal by a Muslim man challenging a maintenance order in favor of his ex-wife under Section 125 CrPC. He had argued that the 1986 Act, which was enacted to nullify the Supreme Court's Shah Bano judgment, should take precedence.

However, the Supreme Court has now firmly established that Muslim women can seek maintenance under the ""religion neutral"" Section 125 CrPC, in line with the spirit of the Shah Bano case.

""We are hereby dismissing the criminal appeal with the major conclusion that Section 125 would be applicable to all women...,"" Justice Nagarathna said while pronouncing the verdict.

Applicability of Section 125 CrPC to Muslim women

The Supreme Court ruled that Section 125 CrPC, which deals with a wife's right to maintenance, applies to all married women including Muslim women.

This overrules the argument that divorced Muslim women can only seek maintenance under the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986.

Practical measures for financial support

The court highlighted the need for husbands to recognize the role and sacrifices of homemaker wives

It suggested practical measures like maintaining joint bank accounts and sharing ATM access to ensure economic stability for women within the household.

NCW welcomes judgment



NEW DELHI: In a landmark decision that is bound to have far-reaching implications, the Supreme Court on Wednesday ruled that a Muslim woman can seek maintenance from her husband under Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure ( CrPC ), which is applicable to all women ""irrespective of religion"".The Supreme Court's ruling establishes the right of Muslim women to seek maintenance from their husbands under the general law, and encourages practical steps to ensure financial security for women in the marriage.NCW chief Rekha Sharma welcomed the Supreme Court's landmark ruling that affirms the right of Muslim women to seek maintenance, saying the decision is a significant step towards ensuring gender equality and justice for all women, regardless of their religion.","Supreme Court rules that a Muslim woman can seek maintenance from her husband under Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure ( CrPC ), which is applicable to all women ""irrespective of religion"" The court highlighted the need for husbands to recognize the role and sacrifices of homemaker wives.

A year later, Navinal's villagers, along with other Mundra villages, approached the high court, arguing that they were left with only 45 acres, inadequate for their cattle needs.Following the villagers' plea, the state government pledged in 2014 to allocate 387 hectares of grazing land to Navinal. The commitment, however, was not fulfilled.In 2015, the state government filed a petition for review in the high court, arguing that only 17 hectares of land were realistically available for allocation to the panchayat.The state government later suggested allocating the remaining land, located approximately seven kilometers away. However, villagers objected, arguing it was impractical for their cattle to travel such a long distance.On July 5, an affidavit was submitted informing the bench that the state government has opted to reclaim approximately 108 hectares or 266 acres of grazing land previously allocated to APSEZ.","The court had asked the government on July 5 to restore the land to a Kutch village, almost 19 years afterit was allotted to Adani Port and Special Economic Zone Ltd.

The Nov 8, 2016, notification had allowed deposition of demonetised currency notes in banks till Dec 30, 2016. Another notification issued on Dec 31, 2016, made it an offence to hold demonetised currency notes after Dec 30 and made the holder liable for penaltyKohli said apart from the bank being obliged to receive demonetised currency notes presented before it by the KYC-compliant company, it was also obligatory for RBI to ensure that the company received the amount in exchange of valid currency notes as each demonetised note contained a written promise by RBI governor to pay the bearer an amount specified on the currency note. The bench issued fresh notice to Axis Bank and asked it to respond within three weeks after RBI counsel said court would have to hear the bank and find out whether it had a valid reason not to accept the demonetised notes.

Supreme Court: Muslim women entitled to maintenance under CrPC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-muslim-women-entitled-to-maintenance-under-crpc/articleshow/111643999.cms,"Supreme Court: Parliament never sought to limit divorced Muslim woman's rights to 'iddat' period

NEW DELHI: In a landmark verdict, Supreme Court on Wednesday said women, irrespective of their faith, were entitled to maintenance under Section 125 of Criminal Procedure Code and rejected the argument that the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986, or personal laws of different communities barred them from taking advantage of maintenance guaranteed under the secular law.A bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and Augustine George Masih held that it was for the Muslim woman to decide which of the two laws or both she should take recourse to. ""Maintenance is a facet of gender parity and enabler of equality, not charity,"" Justice Nagarathna said.In separate but concurring judgments, the judges said Section 125 of CrPC applied to all married women, including Muslims. It said the provision was a measure for social justice to protect weaker sections, irrespective of applicable personal laws of the parties.Rights of maintenance under both ""exist parallelly"" to ensure right to seek maintenance for divorced Muslim woman, Justice Masih said.We are inclined to conclude that equivalent rights of maintenance ascertained under both, the secular provision of Section 125 of CrPC 1973 and the personal law provision of Section 3 of the 1986 Act, parallelly exist in their distinct domains and jurisprudence, thereby, leading to their harmonious construction and continued existence of the right to seek maintenance for a divorced Muslim woman under the provisions of CrPC 1973 despite the enactment of the 1986 Act,"" Justice Masih said, adding that Parliament never sought to restrict the rights of a divorced Muslim woman to the 'iddat' period. 'Iddat' refers to the period of time for which a Muslim woman must wait before she can remarry, 3 months in case of a divorce.The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act was enacted by the Rajiv Gandhi govt in response to pressure from Muslim groups and politicians who were upset with the SC verdict in the Shah Bano case where the court had ordered that the old and indigent divorcee from Bhopal be given a monthly maintenance of Rs 125 per month.Justice Nagarathna said Parliament's intent in enacting the 1986 law was to enhance the rights of a divorced Muslim woman in addition to what she would have been entitled to under Section 125 of CrPC. She said if the intent was to curtail the rights of a divorced Muslim woman, then the clause of 'notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force' would not have found a place in Section 3 and Parliament did not simultaneously or at any time thereafter create any bar for a divorced Muslim woman from claiming maintenance under Section 125.""One cannot read Section 3 of the 1986 Act containing the non obstante clause so as to restrict or diminish the right to maintenance of a divorced Muslim woman under Section 125 of CrPC and neither is it a substitute for the latter. Such an interpretation would be regressive, anti-divorced Muslim woman and contrary to Articles 14, 15(1) and (3) as well as Article 39(e) of the Constitution,"" Justice Nagarathna said.""Therefore, a technical or pedantic interpretation of the 1986 Act would stultify not merely gender justice but also the constitutional right of access to justice for aggrieved Muslim divorced women who are in dire need of maintenance. This court would not countenance unjust or Faustian bargains being imposed on women. The emphasis is on sufficient maintenance, not minimal amount. After all, maintenance is a facet of gender parity and enabler of equality, not charity. It follows that a destitute Muslim woman has the right to seek maintenance under Section 125 of CrPC despite the enactment of the 1986 Act,"" she said.The court noted that Section 125 of CrPC was more beneficial to women in comparison to Section 3 of the 1986 law as maintenance to a divorced Muslim woman is given within the 'iddat' period by her husband under the 1986 law but under the secular provision, any divorced wife is entitled to maintenance till she remarries. Under personal law, maintenance for children is given by her former husband only for a period of two years but under Section 125, maintenance is given until the children attain the age of majority.","Supreme Court: Women, irrespective of their faith, were entitled to maintenance under Section 125 of Criminal Procedure Code.

syllabus cut

: IIT report

NEW DELHI: The Centre informed Supreme Court through a late-evening affidavit on Wednesday that IIT-Madras conducted a comprehensive data analysis of the results of NEET-UG, which was marred by a question paper leak , and found no abnormality .The govt submitted IIT's report in court along with its affidavit and said, ""City-wise and centre-wise analysis was done for two years (2023 and 2024) to find out if there were any abnormal indications.The analysis was carried out for the top 1.4 lakh ranks, given that the total number of seats across the country is around 1.1 lakh. It shows there is neither any indication of mass malpractice nor localised set of candidates being benefited leading to abnormal scores.""The Centre said it is approaching the issue in a manner to ""ensure that no candidate guilty of malpractice gets any benefit, while also ensuring that 23 lakh students are not required to be burdened with a fresh test merely based on unsupported apprehensions"". It expressed commitment towards a robust examination system completely insulated from any malpractice.The apex court will hear the matter on Thursday.The court, while acknowledging that the leak and use of unfair means at a few centres in Patna and Gujarat had compromised the sanctity of the exams, had said it would order a retest if it was convinced that there was a systemic failure, and that the exams were vitiated to the extent that isolating the beneficiaries from untainted examinees would not be possible.Citing the verification done by IIT-M, Centre remained hewed to its stand that leaks and irregularities were limited and localised.On an unusually large number of students getting high scores in NEET-UG this year, the IIT report said, ""There is an overall increase in marks obtained by students, specifically in the range of 550 to 720. This is attributed to 25% reduction in syllabus. In addition, candidates obtaining such high marks are spread across multiple cities and centres, indicating very less likelihood of malpractice.""Centre said IIT-M drew the conclusions by analysing NEET-UG results data with the help of Python for data processing, PostgreSQL for data storage and Metabase for analysis after seeking several data facts from National Testing Agency.On counselling to be carried out based on NEET-UG results, Centre said, ""For any candidate, if it is found that s/he has been beneficiary of any malpractice, candidature of such person would be cancelled at any stage during the counselling process or even afterwards.""Responding to SC's query on steps being taken to make future NEET-UG and similar exams glitch and malpractice free, Centre said it has constituted a seven-member committee of experts chaired by Dr K Radhakrishnan, ex-chairman of Isro and chairman, board of governors, IIT Kanpur.""Confidentiality of question papers is the utmost priority in any examination and govt remains committed towards protecting interests of lakhs of students who have attempted the question papers fairly,"" it said and cited enactment of Public Examination (Prevention of Unfair Means) Act by Parliament on Feb 12.","IIT-Madras conducted a comprehensive data analysis of the results of NEET-UG, which was marred by a question paper leak.

BMW moved Telangana high court for quashing of the cheating FIR.On Mar 23, 2012, HC quashed the prosecution against BMW and suo motu ordered the carmaker to replace the defective car with a new one. The Andhra Pradesh govt and the buyer moved the Supreme Court challenging the high court order. BMW accepted the high court judgment and agreed to replace the defective car with a new one. The buyer, however, did not accept the offer.A bench of Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud and Justices J B Pardiwala expressed surprise at the HC judgment asking BMW to replace the defective car with a new one when the carmaker had only petitioned for quashing of the cheating case lodged against it by the buyer.BMW India's counsel has offered to pay around Rs 30 lakh as compensation to the buyer now, saying a brand new 7-Series car costs more than Rs 1 crore at present and that the value of the used defective car would be around Rs 45 lakh. The car was purchased in 2009 for Rs 85 lakh.SC noted that BMW had accepted the HC judgment and not moved SC challenging the HC order.

The minister’s response in a social media post detailing the work condition of loco pilots came after Congress’s offensive on the work conditions of train drivers following Rahul Gandhi met some of the pilots on Friday.Vaishnaw said loco pilots are important members of the railway family and that there was a lot of misinformation and theatrics by the opposition to demotivate them.In the detailed post, Vaishnaw said the duty hours of loco pilots are carefully monitored and the rest is provided meticulously after trips. “The average duty hours are maintained within prescribed hours. The average is less than 8 hours in June this year. Only under exigencies, the trip duration exceeds the prescribed hours,” he said.On the loco cabs, before 2014, they were in bad shape. The minister said in the past 10 years the cabs have been improved with ergonomic seats, and more than 7,000 of these are air-conditioned. New locomotives are manufactured with AC cabs.With regard to the off-duty resting facility, the minister said that when a pilot completes a trip, they come to the running room for rest if they are out of headquarters. He added that before 2014, running rooms were in bad shape and now almost all (558) running rooms are air-conditioned. The minister said that in running rooms, foot massagers are also provided. “Incidentally, this was criticised by Congress without understanding the working conditions of loco pilots,” he said.Meanwhile, R Kumaresan, president of All India Loco Running Staff Association (South Zone) said that they have been raising three demands — weekly rest should start after the loco pilots exhaust the period rest rest they get after every 8- hour trip, consecutive night duty limited to only two and return to headquarter within 48 hours. “We have not yet got any response to these issues,” he said.","Railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said loco pilots are important members of the railway family.

It has taken nearly 4 decades for this travesty to be corrected by the judgment of Justice Nagarathna and Justice Masih. Every woman has a right to maintenance as observed by Justice Nagarathna and Muslim women cannot be excluded from this provision,” Soman added.She further stated that women have been demanding reforms in personal laws for a long time. “This judgment is a positive step towards upholding equality in marriage and family. Left to themselves personal laws rooted in patriarchy would never grant adequate rights to women. This judgment upholds the constitutional mandate of gender justice & must be celebrated,” she added.Women’s rights activist and director of Centre for Social Research, Ranjana Kumari told TOI that “this is a very welcome development that should have happened long ago when the Shah Bano case happened. At that time, justice was averted when Parliament passed the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986, effectively overturning the Supreme Court's decision in the Shah Bano case. This Act limited the application of Section 125 CrPC, which ensures maintenance for women, regardless of religion.”“The latest Supreme Court judgement rectifies this historical oversight, reinforcing that Section 125 CrPC is universally applicable. This legal assertion is crucial as it empowers Muslim women to seek alimony and maintenance, ensuring their financial security, especially for those with children,” Kumar added.She feels that this judgement “not only upholds the principle of equality before the law but also strengthens the protection of women’s rights across all communities”.All India Democratic Women’s Association general secretary Mariam Dhawale said that it was a welcome judgement as they have been all along advocating for maintenance rights for Muslim women at par with others.","The National Commission for Women chairperson Rekha Sharma said the decision is a “significant step towards ensuring gender equality and justice for all women, regardless of their religion” “It is ironic that maintenance rights granted under 125 Cr Pc were snatched away from Muslim women during Shah Bano in 1985.

The final version is being designed to accommodate six to 16 personnel and will have an innovative structure that promises superior protection against orbital debris and radiation while boasting versatility.Current space habitats, like the International Space Station (ISS), have long grappled with issues of scalability, cost-efficiency, and limited living space. Pointing out that the ISS, weighing a staggering 4.2-lakh-kg and costing $155 billion to launch and assemble over 15 years, exemplifies the economic and logistical hurdles of traditional space structures, the firm says its product can be launched as a compact habitat and will later inflate in space.Siddarth Jena, CEO, Akashalabdhi, told TOI: “Once in the intended orbit of around 1,100km, it will take around seven days for the habitat to fully inflate. We’ve used seven layers to build the habitat and there are special materials. We have a patent for design, and are awaiting a patent for materials used and processes.

While he and his friends left the bar at 1.30 am, the mishap occurred around 5 am.Thus, the mishap within four hours of intoxication, sources said, must have left a strong jolt to the bike on which the victim woman was riding pillion. Mihir was in a BMW at the time of the mishap.Ideally, one should not drink more than 120ml in a day, said a senior excise official, though as per WHO, no amount of alcohol consumption is safe for human health. Mihir, who according to excise officials, was less than 25 years of age, the limit set by the state government for consuming hard liquors or IMFLs. The state excise administration has already suspended the license of a Juhu-Tara Road bar that served Mihir hard liquor despite being underage. The bar premises have been sealed until the next hearing slated on July 19 by the collector.The excise had also found various irregularities with the bar, listed as Don Giovanni Restaurant (Jobel Hospitalities Pvt Ltd bearing license number FL3,1489) on the license, which include selling liquor to non-drinking permit holders in non-permitted areas, non-submission of licensed premises for inspection, mixing the permitted liquor serving area with the non-permitted restaurant zone, variations in the liquor stock permitted against non-permitted, and lack of a liquor transport license for a certain amount of liquor stock. The BMC too has razed illegal constructions made by the bar.Interestingly, on the cash memo, receipt, or signates, the bar has been named as Vice-Global Tapas Bar located in Juhu Tara opposite Juhu Church Road. Following the Worli hit-and-run, this is the first action taken by the Excise so far, and many may follow soon. It may be recalled that after the Porsche mishap in Pune that killed two young students by a drunk minor, around 60 bars across the Mumbai metropolitan region were closed for 5 to 10 days as a punishment for not following closure timings, for offering liquor to underage patrons, and for not issuing a day's drinking permit to them. The action was part of the license suspension punishment.A notice issued by the suburban district collector to the Vice Global Tapas bar on behalf of the state excise has revealed that during interrogation, it was found that Dhruv Jawahar Dedhiya and three others, including Shah, had entered the premises of the bar and were served hard liquor. Of the four, only three including Mihir consumed the liquor and paid the bill worth over Rs 20,000. Mihir, son of Shiv Sena leader Rajesh Shah, has been prima facie found responsible for ramming his BMW into a couple's bike, killing a woman who was virtually thrown to a longer distance from the accident spot due to the jolt of his car.","Mihir Shah, the arrested accused in the Worli hit-and-run case, and his two friends had consumed 12 large pegs of whiskey. The state excise administration has already suspended the license of a Juhu-Tara Road bar that served Mihir hard liquor despite being underage.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111641992,imgsize-770367,width-400,resizemode-4/111641992.jpg"

Government to Guarantee 50% Pension Under NPS for Central Govt Employees,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/government-may-offer-guarantee-under-nps-to-allay-fears/articleshow/111615520.cms,"NEW DELHI: Govt is looking to assure central govt employees who are part of the National Pension System of 50% of the last pay drawn as pension as it seeks to address their concerns over the payout. This is despite the scheme for those recruited from 2004 currently offering high returns for those who stay invested for 25-30 years.A committee headed by finance secretary T V Somanathan had been set up after an announcement by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman.While the Centre has ruled out a return to the Old Pension Scheme (OPS), it kept the window open to provide a certain level of comfort at a time when Congress was announcing a reversal of a decision taken by the Manmohan Singh govt.OPS is a defined benefit scheme, offering half the last salary drawn as pension for life and subject to adjustments in line with pay commission recommendations. In contrast, NPS is a defined contribution scheme where a govt employee provides 10% of the basic salary as his/her contribution and the Centre provides 14%.While the Somanathan committee has looked at the global experience, as well as the results of the tweak undertaken by the Andhra Pradesh govt, it has also carried out extensive calculations to gauge the impact of providing an assured return. Although it is possible for the Centre to offer 40-45% guarantee, politically, it does not address the concern of employees who work for 25-30 years. As a result, there is growing acknowledgement within the govt of offering a 50% guarantee. Which means in case of a shortfall, the govt will fill the gap.Also Read | Budget 2024 income tax expectations: Top 10 things FM Sitharaman should do for salaried taxpayers This means that an annual estimation will also need to be undertaken as several committee members are of the view that unlike the govt pension system, which is unfunded as the Centre does not have a retirement fund . It is likely that the Centre will this time also create a fund that will set aside money, as is the case with companies that have retiral benefits for their employees.Officials have maintained that those who stay employed for 25-30 years are seeing adequate returns to match the pension payment of those under OPS and the complaints of low payouts was only coming from those who have exited the scheme so far, having completed 20 years or less.",The scheme for those recruited from 2004 currently offers high returns for those who stay invested for 25-30 years.

Credit score tips: 7 ways to improve your CIBIL score,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/debt-management/credit-score-tips-7-ways-to-improve-your-cibil-score/articleshow/111630195.cms,"Strategies to boost your CIBIL score

loan EMIs

2. Clear

credit card

3. Review and correct errors in your CIBIL report

4. Limit multiple credit applications

5. Consider a secured credit card

6. Maintain old credit card accounts

7. Monitor co-signed or joint loan accounts

Your CIBIL score plays a critical role in determining whether your credit application gets approved or denied. A high credit score facilitates easier access to credit cards and loans, often at lower interest rates and with additional benefits. Conversely, a low CIBIL score poses significant challenges for individuals seeking urgent credit. Lenders typically reject applications from those with a poor credit score (600 or below), or approve them with higher interest rates.Improving your CIBIL score requires diligent adherence to specific strategies to enhance creditworthiness.Improving your credit score takes time and consistent effort. By following these, you can gradually enhance your CIBIL score and improve your chances of accessing credit facilities in the future.Paying your loan EMIs on time is crucial for maintaining a good credit score. Missing or delaying payments not only incurs penalties but also negatively impacts your credit score.

'Irrespective of religion': SC says Muslim women can seek maintenance from husbands after divorce,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/irrespective-of-religion-sc-says-muslim-women-can-seek-maintenance-from-husbands-after-divorce/articleshow/111624123.cms,"Top Picks For You Supreme Court agrees to examine validity of practice of talaq-e-hasan

NEW DELHI: In a historic ruling, the Supreme Court has declared that Section 125 of the Criminal Procedure Code , which deals with a wife's right to maintenance, applies to all married women regardless of their religion. The decision affirms that Muslim women can also invoke this provision to seek maintenance after divorce.The decision was pronounced by a bench comprising Justices BV Nagarathna and Augustine George Masih, who delivered separate but concurring judgments.The case arose when a Muslim man challenged a Telangana high court order directing him to pay Rs 10,000 as interim maintenance to his former wife. The petitioner's counsel argued that the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986, precludes a divorced Muslim woman from claiming benefits under Section 125 CrPC. However, the Supreme Court bench rejected this contention, upholding the Muslim woman's right to seek maintenance under the general law.In its judgment, SC observed that maintenance is not a matter of charity but a fundamental right of married women. This right, the court said, transcends religious boundaries, reinforcing the principle of gender equality and financial security for all married women.""We are hereby dismissing the criminal appeal with the major conclusion that Section 125 CrPC would be applicable to all woman and not just married woman,"" Justice Nagarathna said, pronouncing the verdict.The apex court highlighted that the time has come for Indian men to recognize the indispensable role and sacrifices made by housewives for the family. The bench highlighted the necessity for husbands to provide financial support to their wives, suggesting practical measures such as maintaining joint bank accounts and sharing ATM access to ensure economic stability for women within the household.","The Supreme Court has declared that Section 125 of the Criminal Procedure Code applies to all married women regardless of their religion.

Demonstrators marched through tourist-heavy areas, chanting “tourists go home” and using water pistols, while others held signs saying “Barcelona is not for sale,” CNN reported.Thousands of people joined the protest in the latest outcry against mass tourism in Spain, which has seen similar demonstrations in the Canary Islands and Mallorca.Protesters argue that mass tourism drives up living costs and diminishes the quality of life for locals.The protest was organized by the Assemblea de Barris pel Decreixement Turístic (Neighborhood Assembly for Tourism Degrowth), a coalition of over 100 local organizations. They argue that these tourists increase prices and strain public services, while the tourism industry profits are unfairly distributed, exacerbating social inequality.The group has put forward 13 proposals to reduce visitor numbers and transition to a new tourism model. These proposals include closing cruise ship terminals, increasing regulation of tourist accommodations, and ending public spending on tourism promotion.The discontent in Barcelona mirrors similar protests in other parts of Spain. In April, residents of the Canary Islands protested against excessive tourism, blaming it for making housing unaffordable and causing environmental harm. These issues are common in many popular tourist destinations worldwide, which have seen record visitor numbers as the travel industry recovers from the pandemic.While increased tourism can benefit local economies and hospitality businesses, it also brings significant drawbacks: more noise, pollution, traffic, resource strain, a lower quality of life for locals, and a diminished experience for visitors. Consequently, many tourist hotspots have introduced measures to combat overtourism, such as new or increased tourist taxes, campaigns to discourage problematic visitors, and attendance caps at popular attractions","Demonstrators march through tourist-heavy areas, chanting ‘tourists go home’ and using water pistols.

Social issues and abortion

Immigration

And Climate change

If Donald Trump wins the presidency in November, his administration is likely to follow the roadmap outlined in Project 2025 , a transition plan created by the Heritage Foundation think tank. The plan, nearly 900 pages long, has been labeled as "" authoritarian ,"" ""dystopian,"" and a ""blueprint for destroying our democracy"" by critics.Project 2025 focuses on a wide range of conservative priorities, including restricting abortion access, rolling back LGBTQ+ rights, abandoning efforts to address climate change and income inequality, and implementing sweeping changes to the federal government workforce.Despite Trump's attempts to distance himself from the document, Project 2025 has been spearheaded by former Trump administration officials, including Paul Dans and Russell Vought. More than 100 conservative organizations have contributed to the plan, many of which would hold significant influence in Washington if Republicans regain control of the White House.The recent spike in attention surrounding the document has been fueled by liberal opposition to it, particularly in light of President Joe Biden's poor debate performance and the US Supreme Court decision strengthening presidential immunity.The four main policy aims of Project 2025 are: restoring the family as the centerpiece of American life, dismantling the administrative state, defending the nation's sovereignty and borders, and securing individual rights. However, the document has faced criticism for its potential to undermine democracy and lead to political violence. Heritage Foundation president Kevin Roberts' comments about a potential ""second American revolution"" have further stoked concerns among Democrats, who accuse Trump and his allies of ""dreaming of a violent revolution to destroy the very idea of America.""The following are some of the main suggestions outlined in Project 2025:In terms of government structure, the plan advocates for the application of the ""unitary executive theory"", which would bring all federal agencies, including the department of justice, under the president's direct authority. This would streamline the decision-making process and enable the president to implement policies more efficiently across various sectors.Furthermore, the proposal seeks to remove job security for many government employees, allowing them to be replaced by individuals appointed based on political affiliations. The document also strongly criticizes the FBI, describing it as a ""bloated, arrogant, increasingly lawless organization"".The Project 2025 policy book outlines several recommendations for the department of health and human services regarding abortion and social issues. One of the key proposals is for the Food and Drug Administration to overturn its long-standing approval of mifepristone, a commonly used abortion pill that has been available for over two decades.Additionally, the policy book advocates for the implementation of stricter regulations surrounding the use of mifepristone. These proposed changes include limiting the timeframe in which the medication can be taken to seven weeks into a pregnancy, as against the current 10-week window.Another significant social issue addressed in the policy book is the participation of transgender individuals in the military. During his first four years in office, Trump banned transgender people from serving in the military. Biden reversed that policy, but the Project 2025 policy book calls for the ban to be reinstated.The document outlines a plan to bolster funding for the construction of a wall along the US-Mexico border, which was one of the key promises made by Trump during his 2016 presidential campaign.In addition to the border wall, Project 2025 suggests a significant restructuring of the immigration enforcement apparatus. The plan involves dismantling the Department of Homeland Security and merging its functions with other immigration enforcement units across various agencies.The document also includes several other proposals aimed at tightening immigration policies. These include the elimination of specific visa categories designed for victims of crime and human trafficking, as well as increasing the fees imposed on immigrants.The Republican platform outlines a significant shift in the nation's approach to climate change and energy policy. It advocates for substantial cuts to government funding for research and development in the renewable energy sector. Instead, the document urges the incoming administration to ""stop the war on oil and natural gas,"" signaling a move away from clean energy initiatives.Under the proposed plan, the focus would pivot from reducing carbon emissions to increasing energy production and ensuring energy security for the country.","Project 2025 is a transition plan created by the Heritage Foundation think tank.

"Agencies blamed for road repair delays, mapping roads s solution: TMC chief",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thane/agencies-blamed-for-road-repair-delays-mapping-roads-s-solution-tmc-chief/articleshow/111641875.cms,"Representative image

THANE: The Thane municipal commissioner Saurabh Rao has blamed the apparent confusion among agencies over their respective liability over roads, highways and flyovers to be the main reason for the delay in addressing to complaints of damaged patches including potholes .Rao, Wednesday, addressed a joint meeting of all agencies and directed them to map the road network and identify the liability of each of the agencies in a bid to ensure prompt response to attending potholes on city roads and highways especially during the rains, officials informed.The city has a network of nearly 400kms of roads including highways and flyovers which have been collectively constructed by the MSRDC , state PWD , NHAI , MMRDA and the TMC and has instances of overlapping projects like those on Ghodbunder road and Eastern Express highways where highways are constructed by one agency and flyovers on the stretch by another while the maintenance is entrusted to a third agency. This often leads to a delay in identifying the agency responsible for repairing the stretch, officials pointed out.It may be noted that there have been several complaints flooding the corporation about damaged road stretches remaining neglected for days together. The damaged roads often leads to slow moving traffic and cause jams on the arterial roads leading to embarrassment to the administration that governs the chief minister’s home town following which the commissioner has formulated a solution.“The commissioner explained that all agencies should work together to make roads and flyovers passing through Thane city to remain pothole-free. Accordingly, as a first step, he has sought clarity about the ownership and liability of repairs of these roads and flyovers as often finding the right agency who is responsible for repairing a particular stretch of road often delays the process leaving commuters inconvenienced,” said an official.Rao has further urged all the agencies involved in road construction and repairs including the Thane Municipal Corporation to work as a team and pool in their resources including manpower and materials whenever required to repair the damaged stretches at the earliest.","The Thane municipal commissioner Saurabh Rao has blamed the apparent confusion among agencies over their respective liability over roads, highways and flyovers.

Panaji: Three Indian teams have the opportunity to rub shoulders with clubs from the Premier League as they compete in the fifth edition of the Next Generation Cup in England.Scheduled to kick off on August 1, the tournament hosted by the Premier League provides India’s talented young footballers with an opportunity to compete with equivalent age-group teams from Premier League academies and the South African Premier Soccer League.The latest edition will see Aston Villa, Crystal Palace, Everton and Tottenham Hotspur represent the Premier League, while Indian clubs include Reliance Foundation Development League (RFDL) champions Punjab FC, runners-up East Bengal FC, and Muthoot FA, the third-place finishers. South Africa’s Stellenbosch FC is the other participating team.Last year, the tournament was played in India, where Wolverhampton Wanderers FC defeated Stellenbosch FC in the final.“The event serves as a fantastic learning experience for the young players both on and off the pitch, providing them with a platform to interact with one another as well as learn about each other's cultures,” said Neil Saunders , the Premier League’s director of football. “It builds on our continued support for the development of the game in India with Reliance Foundation and we hope everyone taking part has an enjoyable and beneficial experience.”India and Bengaluru FC goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu, the first Indian footballer to play in the UEFA Europa League for Norwegian club Stabaek, said competing against international talent and learning from diverse coaching styles was vital to his growth as a footballer.“I'm glad that the tournament provides this platform to today's young players. Tournaments like these are crucial for developing Indian football, providing our youngsters with much-needed international exposure,” he said.Several players who have featured in previous editions of the Next Gen Cup have gone on to make their Premier League debut in recent seasons, including West Ham’s George Earthy, Leicester City’s Michael Golding and Sydie Peck, who played for Arsenal at the time but made his first team debut for Sheffield United.Ethan Wheatley, who recently became the 250th player to progress from Manchester United’s academy to the first team, participated in the tournament in 2020.","Tottenham Hotspur, Aston Villa, Crystal Palace, Everton and Tottenham Hotspur will represent the Premier League.

Desi company faked generic viagra data: US FDA,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/desi-company-faked-generic-viagra-data-us-fda/articleshow/111646081.cms,"Generic versions of erectile dysfunction drugs Viagra and Cialis, among other medications, were allowed on the US market using potentially problematic data that call into question their safety and efficacy, a Bloomberg analysis found.The US Food and Drug Administration alerted brand-name and generic companies on June 18 about a research company in India that had falsified the data used in key studies to gain approval of their medications.Data from the researcher, Synapse Labs, may have been used in hundreds of drugs, which remain available for sale.European regulators last year flagged Synapse to the FDA, which later told US companies that relied on Synapse for key studies to gain approval of their medications that they would have to redo the work somewhere else.The FDA said companies that used Synapse will get a year to submit new data on the drugs. Without that information, it's difficult to know the true outcomes of the studies and whether they're safe. And insurers may have reason to retroactively decide not to cover the medications.""It raises a lot of questions about the implications for the drugs on the market,"" said Massoud Motamed, who was an FDA inspector until Jan 2023 and has a doctorate in biochemistry.Motamed said his biggest concern is that the drugs Synapse was involved with may have too much or too little active ingredient. Too much can lead to dangerous toxicity issues. Drugs that don't have enough active ingredient run the risk of not working.The FDA isn't telling patients, doctors or pharmacists which drugs among thousands might be impacted because the agency said whether a drugmaker used a particular research company for hire is ""confidential information"", according to the FDA alert. Cherie Duvall-Jones, a spokesperson for the agency, said ""the FDA remains vigilant and will act should we identify safety issues"".Bloomberg's analysis identified a number of generic drugs that are no longer deemed the same as the brand though they were earlier this year. Among them are Viagra and Cialis generics made by India's Umedica Laboratories. Other drugs on the list include generics of the cholesterol-lowering drug Lipitor from Lupin and risendronate sodium from Aurobindo Pharma. Umedica, Nivagen, Lupin and Aurobindo didn't respond to requests for comment.The FDA often protects corporate information, including what factory a drug is made in, for fear of running afoul of trade secret laws.","Data from the researcher, Synapse Labs, may have been used in hundreds of drugs, which remain available for sale.

A rally in the world’s largest technology companies sent stocks to all-time highs, with Jerome Powell ’s remarks to Congress not doing much to dissuade traders from betting on Federal Reserve rate cuts this year.For the first time in its history, the S&P 500 topped 5,600. A renewed bid for megacaps drove the US equity benchmark to its longest rally since November, with Nvidia Corp.up over 2.5% and Apple Inc. climbing on news it aims to ship 10% more new iPhones after a bumpy 2023. Treasuries remained fairly stable after a strong $39 billion sale of 10-year bonds. Swaps are pricing in two Fed cuts in 2024 — and higher chances the first comes in September.As Wall Street geared up for the consumer-price index, Powell said the Fed doesn’t need inflation below 2% before cutting rates, while adding officials still have more work to do. He noted the labor market has cooled “pretty significantly.” Powell cited a “good ways to go” on the balance-sheet runoff, and said commercial real estate doesn’t threaten financial stability.“The key takeaway from his testimony is the Fed’s assessment of the balance of risks is shifting in ways that – if supported and sustained by incoming data – will deliver a rate cut in September,” said Krishna Guha at Evercore.The S&P 500 climbed 1% — up for a seventh straight day — to notch its 37th record this year.

That would mark the smallest back-to-back gains since August — a pace more palatable for Fed officials.“June’s CPI report looks to be another ‘very good’ report that should boost the FOMC’s confidence about the inflation trajectory,” said Anna Wong at Bloomberg Economics. “That should set the stage for the Fed to start cutting rates in September.”A survey conducted by 22V Research shows 55% of investors expect the market reaction Thursday’s CPI to be “risk-on,” 16% said “risk-off” and 29% “mixed/negligible.”“There is optimism about inflation generally,” said Dennis DeBusschere at 22V, adding that the survey also showed investors think “CPI is on a Fed-friendly glide path.”Meantime, some trading desks say investors should gear up for a potential break in the eerie calm that’s recently descended on the market.The options market is betting the S&P 500 Index will move 0.8% in either direction after Thursday’s report on consumer prices, based on the price of that day’s at-the-money straddles, according to Stuart Kaiser, Citigroup’s head of US equity trading strategy.If it happens, that would be the biggest move for the index since June 12, the day of the last CPI print and interest-rate decision.Market volatility may pick up in the days and weeks ahead, amid US political uncertainty, comments from the Fed chair, and the start of the second-quarter earnings season, according to Mark Haefele at UBS Global Wealth Management.Source: Citi Global MarketsFor the first time since 2022, S&P 500 earnings may not be laser-focused on just technology, with the quarter’s success hanging on everything aside from the megacap tech heavyweights that have driven stocks to all-time highs, according to Bloomberg Intelligence strategists led by Gina Martin Adams.“While forecasts for the ‘Magnificent Seven’ remain robust, their earnings are expected to slow in the second quarter — just as the rest of the S&P 500 may finally post their first year-on-year growth in at least five quarters,” they noted.The Magnificent Seven may have already peaked, while the remaining S&P 500 stocks may post their first earnings expansion in at least six quarters, the strategists concluded.","S&P 500 Sees Longest Winning Streak Since November.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner.
