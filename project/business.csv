"On eve of Bangladesh victory day, Sheikh Hasina says Yunus 'secretly helping communal forces'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/on-eve-of-bangladesh-victory-day-sheikh-hasina-says-yunus-secretly-helping-communal-forces/articleshow/116350252.cms,"Bijoy Dibos

NEW DELHI: On the eve of, deposed Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Sunday called the interim government headed by Muhammad Yunus an ""undemocratic group"" that is ""secretly supporting anti-liberation extremist-communal forces.""In a statement to commemorate the defeat of Pakistani forces in Bangladesh’s Liberation War of 1971, Hasina dubbed Muhammad Yunus as a ""fascist"" seeking to stifle the spirit of the Liberation War and pro-liberation forces.The statement released by her party revolved around the role of her father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, and the Awami League in the struggle that culminated in the emergence of Bangladesh in 1971. Hasina took the opportunity to criticise Nobel laureate Yunus, who formed an interim government shortly after she stepped down and fled to India.""This undemocratic group, led by the fascist Yunus, has no responsibility towards the people,"" she said.""They are seizing power and obstructing all public welfare work,"" she added.Hasina slammed the Yunus-led administration, claiming that the people of Bangladesh were burdened by rising prices.""As this government is not democratically elected, it has no accountability to the people. Their main aim is to suppress the spirit of the Liberation War and the pro-liberation forces, silencing their voices,"" Hasina said.""The lack of sensitivity of the leaders of this government, including the fascist Yunus, towards the Liberation War and its history is evident in every step they take,"" she further said.Sheikh Hasina, who fled Bangladesh after massive student protests, accused the interim government of attempting to erase “progressive ideals,” the history and spirit of the Liberation War, and “all traces of the Great War of Liberation from national life.”In her statements after reaching India, Hasina has repeatedly accused Yunus of perpetrating “genocide” and failing to protect Hindus and other minorities. Yunus reportedly raised concerns about Hasina’s presence in India with Indian foreign secretary Vikram Misri during a visit to Dhaka last week, claiming that the statements did not go well with the people of Bangladesh. Yunus and other high ranking leaders of the caretaker administration have sought Hasina’s extradition from India.","Sheikh Hasina calls interim government headed by Muhammad Yunus an ""undemocratic group"" Hasina says Yunus is seeking to stifle the spirit of the Liberation War and pro-liberation forces.

MUMBAI: In a surprise move, NCP president and deputy CM Ajit Pawar dropped veteran NCP leader Chhagan Bhujbal , a prominent OBC face in the previous govt, from the cabinet. ""I have no comments to offer on the NCP leadership's decision. It is the prerogative of the NCP president; I will abide by it,"" Bhujbal told TOI.The cabinet expansion took place soon after Ajit Pawar hinted at introducing a two-and-a-half-year ministerial term for certain portfolios, instead of a full five-year stint. The strategy aimed at ensuring broader representation from various districts and regions, was formulated with the approval of CM Devendra Fadnavis and deputy CM Eknath Shinde, he said.Along with Bhujbal, Ajit Pawar has dropped senior NCP leader Dilip Walse Patil, Dharamrao Baba Atram, Anil Patil and Sanjay Bansode. Walse Patil handling the cooperation portfolio, Patil relief and rehabilitation, Atram food and drug administration and Bansode sports in the previous govt led by Shinde.Senior NCP leaders expressed surprise over the unceremonious removal of Bhujbal, who had taken up the cause of OBCs during the storm caused by the Maratha quota stir. ""It was wrong to drop Bhujbal from the cabinet when he had stood against Maratha leader Manoj Jarange,"" said a senior NCP neta.Apparently, Ajit Pawar felt that it was high time that senior NCP leaders, particularly those aged above 70, should be retired and replaced by new faces. ""We agree with Ajit Pawar, but this was not the proper time for it. He should have waited for a brief period, at least till Jarange's importance subsides,"" said the NCP neta.As per reports, there was strong opposition to Bhujbal's induction from newly elected legislators, including all from Nashik district, led by Manikrao Kokate from Sinnar.Another senior NCP functionary said Walse Patil, a veteran party leader, had told Ajit Pawar that he was not keen on joining the cabinet owing to health concerns. Walse Patil, who was present at the swearing-in ceremony, may take up a gubernatorial assignment at a later stage, as per the understanding between NCP and BJP.","Chhagan Bhujbal had taken up the cause of OBCs during the storm caused by the Maratha quota stir.

"Over 750 animals rescued from mass sacrifice, but 4,200 buffaloes slaughtered at religious festival in Nepal",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/over-750-animals-rescued-from-mass-sacrifice-but-4200-buffaloes-slaughtered-at-religious-festival-in-nepal/articleshow/116258982.cms,"Representative Image /AI Generated

NEW DELHI: The mass animal sacrifice at the Gadhimai festival in Nepal kept India’s border guarding force, Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB), and local administration across several districts in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh on their toes. This resulted in saving more than 750 animals, including buffaloes and goats, from being slaughtered early this week. The festival, nevertheless, witnessed the slaughter of 4,200 buffaloes at the Gadhimai temple on December 8-9.Nearly 400 of the rescued animals, including 74 buffaloes saved before they headed for the mass sacrifice, have found homes for future care at Vantara, a wildlife and rehabilitation centre of the Reliance group in Jamnagar, Gujarat.This first-of-its-kind rescue operation was possible with the intervention of the Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI) and animal welfare groups such as People for Animals (PFA) and Humane Society International/India (HSI/India). Their volunteers worked on the ground with district administration and stopped the illegal transportation of hundreds of buffaloes, goats, pigeons, and chickens to Nepal ahead of the mass sacrifice that took place over two days on December 8-9.Held every five years in Bariyarpur village in the Bara district of Nepal, the festival is estimated to see the sacrifice of as many as 5 lakh animals at the Gadhimai temple. Though these animals are mostly procured locally, a substantial number comes from Bihar and UP despite the Supreme Court of India directing the govt in 2014 to stop the illegal transportation of animals to Nepal for sacrifice at the Gadhimai temple.When asked about the number of animals sacrificed this year, Arkaprava Bahar of HSI/India, who led the rescue efforts at the border, said, “It is challenging to determine the exact number, as only buffalo sacrifices are officially tracked. However, it is estimated that 2.5 to 5 lakh animals were sacrificed during that period, including 4,200 buffaloes, based on the temple committee’s receipts.”At Vantara, the rescued animals will receive veterinary care, including necessary medical treatment to help them recover from the hardships they endured. “We are filled with joy knowing they have been saved from the horrors of the Gadhimai sacrifice and will now live and flourish in a safe, loving environment (at Vantara). Their successful relocation will ensure the best possible long-term care and well-being for these animals,” said Gauri Maulekhi, trustee at PFA.The AWBI wrote in October to police chiefs of both Bihar and UP, asking them to prevent the illegal transportation of animals ahead of the festival. The Board member, Girish J Shah, also coordinated the campaign with the district administration to rescue the animals.The Gadhimai festival, whose origins date back around 265 years, involves a month-long celebration culminating in the ritual slaughter of hundreds of thousands of animals. Though the Supreme Court of Nepal ordered in 2019 an end to animal sacrifices at Gadhimai and urged authorities to create a plan to phase out this practice, the neighbouring country has, so far, not been successful in controlling it.When asked about the reason, Bahar said, “As per Nepal’s Supreme Court, the practice of animal sacrifice is inappropriate from religious, social, cultural, environmental, moral, and logical perspectives, and efforts should be made to phase it out. However, the court also conveyed that reforms must respect social and cultural contexts to avoid disrupting societal structures. A direct ban without addressing these factors would be premature.“To achieve a gradual cessation of animal sacrifice, a few directives have been issued to relevant ministries and authorities in Nepal to develop and implement a phased plan to ban animal sacrifice, considering social, cultural, and religious sensitivities.”He said the temple committee, along with the local administration, however, uses these social and cultural contexts as protection to continue the sacrifice.","Nearly 400 of the rescued animals, including 74 buffaloes saved before they headed for the mass sacrifice, have found homes for future care at Vantara, a wildlife and rehabilitation centre in Jamnagar, Gujarat.

HYDERABAD: Indian students studying in Canada have reported receiving emails asking them to resubmit crucial documents such as study permits, visas and educational records, including marks and attendance.The request from Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada (IRCC), a government department that deals with foreign students, caused widespread panic among international students, many of whom hold visas with up to two years' validity.The development comes as IRCC tightens its policies to regulate the influx of international students, introducing stricter financial requirements and exploring potential caps on student admissions. ""I was a bit shocked when I received the email. My visa is valid until 2026, yet I was asked to submit all my documents again,"" said Avinash Kaushik, a postgraduate student from Hyderabad studying in Surrey, British Columbia. ""They even want proof of attendance, marks, where we are working part-time, etc.,"" he added.Last week, a similar surge in such emails was reported among students from Punjab.

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Sunday said that changes in foreign policy should not be seen as a political attack.""When we speak about changing foreign policy, if there is talk about post-Nehruvian construct, it should not be seen as a political attack. It (the change in foreign policy) didn't require Narendra Modi to do it. Narsimha Rao started it,"" Jaishankar said.Speaking at an event in Delhi, the EAM said, ""There are four big factors which should cause us to ask ourselves 'what are the changes which are necessary in foreign policy?'""1: For many years we had the Nehru development model. The Nehru development model produced a Nehruvian foreign policy. It wasn't just about what was happening in our country, there was an international landscape in the 1940s, 50s, 60s, and 70s, which was bipolar.2: Then there was a unipolar landscape.3: On top of it we have seen, particularly in the last 25 years, a very intense globalization, a very strong interdependence between countries. So, in a way, the relationship and the behaviour of States towards each other has also changed.4: Finally, if one looks at the impact of technology, technology on foreign policy, technology on State capability, and technology on our daily existence, that too has changed. So if the domestic model has changed, if the landscape has changed, if the behavioural patterns of States have changed, and if the tools of foreign policy have changed, how can foreign policy remain the same, EAM Jaishankar remarked.EAM Jaishankar also outlined India's evolving global role, and said, ""Today, India is a country of whom there are greater expectations, a country which has greater responsibilities. The idea of India as a first responder will get more frequent. In the expanded neighbourhood region would be an expectation that India be part of an international response whenever wanted. Because the world is changing, there will be new ideas and initiatives... The whole construct is going to be more open architecture and more multiple choices, but much deeper involvement and more complex decisions.""Jaishankar also underscored the importance of deeper engagement with the world, saying, "" We have to do very much more with the world. It's for the good of this country that our progress and development will accelerate with a deeper engagement with the world. So my sense for the foreign policy ahead would be to think big, to think long, but to think smart.""Acknowledging both continuity and change in foreign policy, Jaishankar said, ""In all frankness, (foreign policy ) is a mix of the old and new. The issues that we have historically confronted, many of them have not gone away. We have yet to secure our borders. We are still combating terrorism on a very serious scale. There are the hangovers of the past. There are the requirements of the present. We have already moved to a foreign policy which is much more directly tasked to advance national development.""He noted a shift in focus within India's foreign policy apparatus over the past decade. ""If you look at all the joint communiques the foreign ministry policy apparatus puts out, you would see in the last 10 years much greater stress on economic diplomacy . When the prime minister or foreign minister goes out, there is much more about technology, capital, best practices, collaborations and investments. These occupy a much larger space... We have taken some valuable lessons from other countries in Southeast Asia and East Asia, who were doing it much longer than we were doing,"" the external affairs minister said."," External affairs minister S Jaishankar said that changes in foreign policy should not be seen as a political attack. He listed the four factors which should cause us to ask ourselves 'what are the changes which are necessary in foreign Policy?'""1: For many years we had the Nehru development model.2: Then there was a unipolar landscape.3: On top of it we have seen, particularly in the last 25 years, a very intense globalization.4: Finally, if one looks at the impact of technology, technology on foreign policy,"" he said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116339894,imgsize-1303016,width-400,resizemode-4/116339894.jpg"

JAGDALPUR: Dealing yet another blow to Left-wing extremists in their 'core' area of south Bastar, counter-Naxal forces have set up a security camp in the den of Bastar's most-dreaded Maoist leader Madvi Hidma , commander of the People's Liberation Guerrilla Army's 'Battalion No. 1'.The forward operating base in Golla Konda on the Bijapur-Sukma border was opened on Saturday, coinciding with the visit of home minister Amit Shah as security forces move deeper into the remaining Maoist bastions in their quest to completely eliminate Left-wing extremism by March 2026.Hidma is the youngest member of the CPI (Maoist) central committee and the mastermind behind many fatal ambush-attacks, including the 2010 Dantewada massacre in which 75 CRPF personnel were killed and the 2017 attack in Sukma that left over two dozen people dead. He has a Rs 1 crore bounty on his head but has managed to evade capture. Golla Konda is the operating base of PLGA's 'Battalion No. 1' and 'Pamedh Area Committee', considered the most battle-hardened unit of the CPI (Maoist).As many as 25 forward operating bases or security camps have been set up by forces this year in Bastar division alone, covering the once Naxal-infested zones in Narayanpur, Dantewada, Bijapur and Kanker. The setting up of these security camps is an exercise in area domination as well as creating a secure bubble to enable development, governance and welfare outreach by the administration in the surrounding villages.This security-cum-development strategy has been fired up in recent months, with Shah taking frequent reviews to monitor the response to his call for uprooting LWE from the country by March 2026.A key Maoist bastion brought down by the forces recently was Tekalgudam, where Left-wing extremists were in total control until a few months back. When the forces moved in and established a security camp in Jhidpalli here, there was intermittent firing by extremists for 2-3 days on security personnel manning the outer cordon. Now, of course, the Naxals are on the back foot. In the past couple of days alone, nine Maoist were killed in Bijapur and Narayanpur districts.",Counter-Naxal forces have set up a security camp in the den of Bastar's most- dreaded Maoist leader Madvi Hidma.

Shah: Anti-Maoist fight intensified after BJP took office in Chhattisgarh

JAGDALPUR: Home minister Amit Shah delivered a firm message to Left-wing extremists during the closing ceremony of Bastar Olympics Sunday, urging them to shun violence and choose rehabilitation.""Give up the path of violence and we shall take care of your rehabilitation or ignore our appeal for surrender and face resolute action by the security forces... I appeal to you all with folded hands to surrender. Have trust in Prime Minister Narendra Modi and join the mainstream. If you give up arms, then your rehabilitation is our responsibility. But we will not allow you to destroy peace in the land of Goddess Danteshwari any more. If you give up arms, we shall welcome you with open arms but if you continue on the path of violence, the forces will tackle you head on,"" Shah said as the battle against Naxals reaches their last bastion deep inside Abujhmad region in Chhattisgarh.The action against Maoists is part of a decisive war to achieve the Modi govt's goal of a Left-wing extremism-free India by March 2026.Shah said the fight had gathered pace after installation of a BJP govt in Chhattisgarh. As many as 287 Maoists were eliminated by counter-Naxal forces, while 837 surrendered and 952 were arrested in the past one year, said the minister, who also presented the 'President's Colours' to Chhattisgarh Police earlier in the day.Later in the afternoon, Shah met surrendered Naxalites from several states. He lauded Chhattisgarh govt's surrender policy as the most attractive in the country.Shah said the Modi govt's multi-pronged strategy of fortifying the security cordon in Maoist-hit zones (by setting up forward operating bases there), devising an attractive surrender and rehabilitation policy for those willing to give up arms and also pushing development and welfare schemes in areas liberated from Maoists' hold, had helped bring down deaths of security forces and civilians by 73% and 70%, respectively, in the past 10 years.Talking of the road ahead, Shah assured that the govt was committed to creating more avenues for local youth, including surrendered Naxals, by promoting small-scale industries, dairy and other cooperatives, tendu patta reform, etc.He said of the 15,000 dwellings approved under PM Awas Yojana for Chhattisgarh, 9,500 were for Bastar region alone.Shah said the Bastar Olympics, with 1.6 lakh participants, told the tale of ongoing transformation of the once Maoist-dominated belt and would lay the foundation of lasting peace and development. ""The event is the last nail in the coffin of Naxalism ,"" he said.""Bastar is changing. And when I visit Bastar again for the 2026 Bastar Olympics, I am confident I will be able to say that Bastar has changed,"" he added.Highlighting the unparalleled natural beauty of Bastar, Shah also declared the govt's intent to develop the region into an attractive tourist destination. ""I have visited Chitrakote waterfall. Bastar's natural beauty is boundless. I assure you that this region will one day get more tourists than Kashmir,"" he said.",Home minister Amit Shah delivered a firm message to Left-wing extremists.

His lawyer Ghosh was attacked by 30 lawyers when he sought to fix an early bail hearing

KOLKATA: Rabindra Ghosh , Bangladeshi advocate fighting an uphill battle for jailed Iskcon monk Chinmoy Krishna Das , reached India on Sunday evening for medical treatment, much to the relief of his family members, who were worried about his safety in the neighbouring country. Ghosh, 75, will be staying with his son, Rahul, who lives in Barrackpore in West Bengal with his wife and child.Ghosh, a senior lawyer of Bangladesh Supreme Court, has been representing minority voices in Bangladesh for over two decades. He hit the headlines internationally when he, while moving an application in a Chittagong court to fix an early bail hearing for Chinmoy Krishna, allegedly came under attack from a group of 30 lawyers who entered the courtroom without permission.Ghosh, originally from the Unosottar Para locality in Chittagong, stays in Dhaka with his wife Krishna, a retired schoolteacher. Krishna stays alone in Dhaka often while Ghosh is travelling.""I have been in constant touch with my parents. After the Chittagong court incident, I spoke to my father in Dhaka. He said he had lodged a police complaint in Chittagong after he was issued threats by fundamentalists. He might have been provided police protection in Chittagong, but he will have to stay unprotected on reaching Dhaka,"" Rahul told TOI from Barrackpore.Rahul said he has requested his father to stay on in Barrackpore until the situation normalises in Bangladesh.But Ghosh is said to have told his friends and colleagues in Bangladesh that he would return soon to continue the fight against rights violations in his country. ""He is a man of principles. Even we have become used to constant threats. It's the price he - and, by extension, our family - has had to pay for keeping up the fight. Even my sisters, who live in Canada, are worried,"" Rahul said.Ghosh, a ""Muktijoddha"" (fought in the Bangladesh liberation war) has never even harboured the thought of migrating elsewhere. ""My daughters have asked my wife and I to move to Canada several times. Why should I leave my motherland and the oppressed?"" Ghosh told TOI.He even refuses to let age catch up with his fight. ""I appealed to several local lawyers to fight the case for the monk, but there was no positive response. At this age, it is difficult for me to travel to Chittagong from Dhaka, a distance of nearly 250km.

NEW DELHI: States should gear up and lead in bringing reforms for ease of business, cutting red tapes, and reducing compliance burdens, to grab the opportunities of overseas investment coming to India due to changing global scenario, PM Narendra Modi told chief secretaries from states who were in Delhi for a three-day conference.The PM also told the top bureaucrats from states to prepare proper plans for development of tier -2 and tier-3 cities and towns, which are set to emerge as the major hub of economic activities, sources said. “Each such city has its own unique selling proposition (USP) and this must be harnessed while making development plans to attract investments. The PM’s focus was on creating more employment opportunities by getting higher investments and the states need to take lead,” said an official.Global investors are looking at India as a better destination for investment considering good returns compared to other nations, safe environment and huge domestic consumption propelled by the large middle class population. Industries are also looking at setting manufacturing units in India and to export to other countries.“The PM suggested to the chief secretaries that states hold thematic brainstorming sessions to prepare the plan for taking correct steps for growth and development. We have an opportunity to harness the demographic dividend that each state has. For this we need to have a shared vision amongst departments in states and at the national level,” said another official.The PM, on Sunday, spent the full day with chief secretaries and top central govt officials, going through thematic presentations as well. He had spent a few hours at the conference on Saturday as well.This was the fourth such national conference of chief secretaries. The focus of this year’s conference was to prepare a collaborative action to harness India’s demographic dividend by promoting entrepreneurship, enhancing skilling initiatives, and creating sustainable employment opportunities for both rural and urban populations. The conference focussed on manufacturing, services, rural non-farm, urban, renewable energy, and circular economy.","PM Narendra Modi told top bureaucrats from states to prepare proper plans for development of tier -2 and tier-3 cities and towns.

It also has provisions for empowering 'safai karamcharis' (cleanliness workers) in cities to levy fines/penalties on unsegregated waste and to refuse waste collection. The rules will come into force from October 1 next year.Apart from municipal bodies, the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2024, cover waste generation and management activities of hotels, malls, residential complexes, wholesale markets, govt institutions, PSUs, industrial units, schools, colleges, and universities among other bulk waste generators.The rules also make provisions for environmental compensation (penalty) based on the polluter pays principle on persons/entities who do not comply with their mandated tasks.""All hotels, restaurants, resident welfare, market associations, and gated communities and institutions with more than 5,000 sqm area shall, within one year from the date of notification of these rules and in partnership with the local body, ensure segregation of waste at source by the generators as prescribed in these rules, facilitate collection of segregated waste in separate streams, hand over recyclable material to either the authorised waste pickers or the authorised recyclers,"" said the draft rules, issued by the environment ministry on December 9.It said, ""The bio-degradable waste shall be processed, treated, and disposed of through composting or bio-methanation within the premises as far as possible. The residual waste shall be given to the waste collectors or agency as directed by the local body.""The rules, published on Saturday, enlist the duties of all waste generators in detail and also formulate guidelines on how to use it in economic activities, including the 'waste to energy' process and product manufacturing through circularity.Besides elaborating on the responsibilities of local bodies and central/state pollution watchdogs on managing municipal and industrial waste, the proposed rules also have detailed guidelines on managing agri-residue such as paddy stubble and other farm waste in rural areas. It will be the responsibility of gram panchayats to ensure that ""there are no instances of burning of agriculture & horticulture waste and levy heavy penalty on persons involved in open burning of agriculture & horticulture waste.""Under the rules, the gram panchayats will ""facilitate the establishment of collection and storage"" of agri-residue in its jurisdiction for its utilization. The gram panchayats will also have to file “annual returns” by June 30 every year regarding the agri-residue generated, agri-residue utilized in-situ, and agri-residue transported for ex-situ utilization within its jurisdiction on the centralised online portal.These provisions will be quite helpful in managing paddy stubble, particularly in Delhi-NCR, where the episodes of biomass burning substantially contribute to air pollution during every winter season.The draft rules seek to address the adverse effects of unmanaged solid waste; implement principles of circular economy; further strengthen monitoring, reporting, and enforcement of rules covering both urban and rural areas; promote bio-economy and improve the quality of the environment across the country.The ministry has, meanwhile, invited stakeholders and experts to share their objections, if any, on the draft rules within the next sixty days. Their views/suggestions will be considered before issuing the final rules in the gazette.","The rules will come into force from October 1 next year.

Flagging off voyage of cargo ships and barges Union shipping minister Sarbananda Sonowal said the advantage of moving cargo through waterways being an economical, ecologically sound and efficient mode of transportation, govt wants to boost freight transportation via waterways, to decongest the railways and roadways.He said the Jalvahak scheme incentivises long haul cargo on NW1 (Ganga), NW2 (Bramhaputra) and NW16 (Barak), and provides an opportunity for the trade interests to explore movement of cargo via waterways with positive economic value proposition.Under the scheme, cargo owners transporting goods over distances exceeding 300 km via waterways will receive up to 35% reimbursement on operating costs. The scheme will be for three years and is designed to optimise supply chains for major shipping companies, freight forwarders, and trade bodies. The cargo promotion scheme is projected to facilitate a modal shift of 800 million tonne-kilometres with an estimated investment of Rs 95.4 crore by 2027, a statement said.“The regular scheduled freight service, which began from Kolkata, will ensure that the cargo is transported and delivered within a stipulated time frame,” Sonowal said.

'Surgery was painful': UnitedHealthcare CEO killer Luigi Mangione's social media posts indicate about his health struggles,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/surgery-was-painful-unitedhealthcare-ceo-killer-luigi-mangiones-social-media-posts-indicate-about-his-health-struggles/articleshow/116270935.cms,"Social media posts of Luigi Mangione , who was detained as a suspect in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, give an insight into his physical and mental health issues.Last year, following his spinal surgery for chronic back pain , he became an advocate for the procedure that positively transformed his life. He actively encouraged individuals facing similar conditions, to challenge medical professionals who suggested pain was inevitable.His Reddit posts discuss spondylolisthesis, a spinal condition where vertebral fractures cause misalignment. This can lead to severe pain when nerves are compressed.According to his social media posts, this condition, which can develop during childhood or through injury, began significantly affecting Mangione's life in recent years.Following his studies at the University of Pennsylvania, where he obtained bachelor's and master's degrees, he was employed at TrueCar, a Santa Monica-based car-buying website until 2023. He resided in Hawaii beginning January 2022. His back condition deteriorated, partly due to a surfing incident during his six-month residence at Surfbreak, a ""co-living"" accommodation in Honolulu.According to Josiah Ryan, who speaks for Surfbreak's owner and founder R.J. Martin, Mangione increasingly voiced concerns about his pain. The condition affected his ability to participate in recreational activities and exercise, and he worried about its impact on potential romantic relationships.""That was definitely a theme in his time there,"" Ryan said. ""He wasn't a big complainer. So it wasn't like he was bringing it up constantly. But the people who knew him knew this was a significant part of his life.""In July 2023, Mangione shared on Reddit his decision to undergo surgery.""I got caught in this loop for a year, all the while putting my life on hold in my 20's and damaging my nerves while I waffled on the decision. I have surgery scheduled in two weeks and I keep wondering why I was so afraid of it,"" he wrote.His posts indicated the procedure was successful. His X account displayed what seemed to be an X-ray showing a metal rod and multiple screws inserted in his lower spine.""Surgery was painful for the first couple days, but I was shocked that by day 7 I was on literally zero pain meds,"" Mangione posted on Reddit in August 2023. ""Obviously will be awhile until I get into rigorous activity, but it was way less of a big deal than I had anticipated.""In a post from July 2018, he discussed his academic challenges and thoughts of leaving university. However, he noted that ""staying in college has at least let me maintain some semblance of normality.""His final Reddit contribution was on May 17, with surrounding posts indicating stability and no apparent health complications. He appeared supportive of the surgical procedure he had undergone previously.In early April, he shared details about equipment chosen for an extended Asian backpacking adventure involving motorcycle travel, describing it as having ""the perfect balance between minimalism and practicality.""Later that month, he offered advice to another Reddit user experiencing back issues, suggesting persistent consultation with different surgeons and emphasising work inability if needed.""We live in a capitalist society,"" he wrote. ""I've found that the medical industry responds to these key words far more urgently than you describing unbearable pain and how it's impacting your quality of life.""However, his Reddit posts, did not contain direct criticism of health insurance industry profits. These sentiments apparently emerged later, as evidenced by a handwritten note discovered after his arrest for allegedly killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.The note mentions ""parasites"" within the healthcare system and criticises health insurers' influence and earnings, According to law enforcement officials. Upon his arrest in Pennsylvania, Mangione was heard shouting about an ""insult to the intelligence of the American people"" while being escorted into court by sheriff's deputies.Meanwhile, a senior New York City police official confirmed on Thursday to NBC New York that there was no evidence of Mangione ever having UnitedHealthcare insurance.Although the incident has led to questions about potential negative healthcare experiences, Mangione's 2023 post-surgery Reddit activity showed satisfaction with his treatment and relief from chronic pain. He advised others not to fear surgical complications and mentioned travelling to Asia for backpacking this year.Interestingly, the 26-year-old Ivy League alumnus appears to have ceased social media activity approximately six months ago, coinciding with his loss of contact with family and friends.Whilst his arrest has shocked his close circle, limited information exists about his recent physical and psychological wellbeing.Meanwhile, healthcare professionals acknowledge the complexities of treating back pain.""In the gross majority of treatments, surgery is when everything else has failed to provide relief,"" said Dr Jason Pittman, co-director of the Spine Centre at Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Centre. He said that doctors typically explore conservative treatments like physical therapy, injections or medications before considering surgery.Despite having health insurance, patients may face substantial surgical costs depending on deductibles and other variables, although Mangione's financial situation remains unclear.Dr Padma Gulur, a pain specialist at Duke Health, highlights that chronic back pain can substantially affect mental wellbeing.“If you have underlying mental health issues — anxiety, depression — your pain can be worse because you have way more suffering. But, the second aspect is pain can push you into anxiety and depression,” said Gulur.Additionally, details about Mangione's recent mental health remain unclear, though evidence suggests he was becoming increasingly isolated.Police reports indicate that his family filed a missing person report in San Francisco in November. During his time at university, Mangione had shared his struggles with cognitive issues and sleep disturbances on Reddit.",Luigi Mangione was detained as a suspect in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.

Johnson suggested a collective recognition of the league’s talent, like Angel Reese, to avoid ""hard feelings."" While Clark ’s record-breaking achievements were overlooked, her comments on racial disparities in sponsorships gained widespread support, fueling a wave of fans backing her on social media.Caitlin Clark’s recognition as Time’s 2024 Athlete of the Year was a milestone for the WNBA , but instead of a celebration, it sparked controversy, especially after Washington Mystics co-owner Sheila Johnson voiced her objections.Johnson expressed disappointment in Clark being singled out, arguing that a collective recognition of the league’s talent, like Angel Reese, would have been more fitting. She cautioned that focusing on one player could create “hard feelings” within the WNBA. While her perspective highlighted the contributions of other rising stars, it overlooked Clark’s record-breaking performances and the visibility she’s brought to the league.What also caught attention was Clark’s acknowledgment of the disparities in sponsorships and media coverage for Black athletes. In her Time profile, she expressed a commitment to advocating for better representation, a stance Johnson supported. However, Johnson’s earlier comments left fans questioning the WNBA’s unity, sparking an outpouring of support for Clark across social media.Also Read: Carmelo Anthony shares three word message to encourage Dash Daniels for joining NBL journey A heated debate is brewing as fans call out the WNBA for its lack of support for Caitlin Clark. “Has A’ny WNBA player supported Caitlin Clark publicly since the TIMES article?

You’d think the ✌🏽sisterhood✌🏽 would have her back and stand with her since she defended them right?” implying tension with A’ja Wilson , whose silence fans attribute to jealousy over Clark’s rapid rise. Despite Clark's $28 million Nike deal before even playing a game, many believe she’s been unfairly sidelined by the league. (via: EssentiallySports)Critics accuse WNBA stars like A’ja Wilson, Breanna Stewart, and Diana Taurasi of not standing up for Clark. Fans argue that if these players spoke out, the narrative could change. The controversy deepened when A’ja’s earlier Nike deal was revealed, fueling speculation about why Clark hasn’t received her own signature shoe yet.The issue of white privilege also resurfaced in a viral video with A’ja and Kelsey Plum, adding more fuel to the fire. As Clark's fanbase grows, the silence from WNBA stars continues to spark critical conversations about fairness and race. The question remains: will anyone speak up, or will the silence persist?","Caitlin Clark's recognition as Time's 2024 Athlete of the Year sparked controversy.

In a recent social media exchange, Elon Musk spotlighted Singapore’s steep decline in fertility rates, a trend he described as an existential challenge. Responding to a post by Mario Nawfal—a prominent personality on X (formerly Twitter)—about the nation’s ""baby crisis"" and the potential role of robotics in addressing the issue, Musk remarked,This statement has reignited global discussions on the demographic struggles of developed nations, where falling birth rates pose long-term economic and social challenges. Musk, a vocal advocate for population growth, has frequently warned of the adverse consequences of shrinking populations, emphasizing the importance of addressing these issues for global sustainability. The post highlights concerns about aging societies and their impact on labor markets, innovation, and healthcare systems, while underscoring the rising interest in technologies like robotics to compensate for declining human workforce numbers.Singapore has been grappling with a steady decline in its Total Fertility Rate (TFR) over the last three decades. In 2023, the TFR reached a historic low of 0.97, marking the first time it has dipped below 1.0. This figure signifies that, on average, each woman in Singapore is having fewer than one child—far below the replacement level of 2.1 required to maintain a stable population.The primary drivers of Singapore’s fertility decline stem from evolving societal trends. Data from the Singapore government reveals that a growing number of women aged 25–34, considered prime childbearing years, are choosing to remain single. Additionally, the marital fertility rate among women in their 20s has seen a substantial decline, accounting for approximately 32% of the overall drop in TFR.Between 1990 and 2005, marital fertility rates among women aged 25–34 experienced a sharp decrease. While there was a slight recovery in 2023, the long-term trend remains concerning.Despite its demographic challenges, Singapore’s advancements in robotics and automation could help address labor shortages caused by a declining workforce. According to the International Federation of Robotics, Singapore ranks second globally in robot density, with 770 industrial robots per 10,000 workers. This technological prowess allows the country to sustain industries despite high labor costs and a relatively small manufacturing base.Musk’s interest in robotics is well-documented through Tesla’s investment in humanoid robots designed to perform repetitive or dangerous tasks. While he has not directly suggested robots as a replacement for human populations, his remarks hint at the potential for technology to mitigate the economic and social impacts of declining birth rates.Musk’s statement sparked widespread debate on social media, with opinions ranging from support to criticism.Some users highlighted Singapore’s strong immigration policies as a mechanism to counteract its population decline. The city-state has long relied on foreign talent and workers to supplement its labor force and sustain economic growth.Others pointed to deeper issues contributing to the reluctance to have children. Rising living costs, financial instability, and paycheck-to-paycheck lifestyles were frequently cited as barriers to family planning.Notably, many individuals expressed concerns about the affordability of raising children in an increasingly competitive and expensive environment.Singapore’s struggle with low fertility rates mirrors challenges faced by many developed nations, including Japan, South Korea, and certain European countries. Declining birth rates have far-reaching consequences, including:","Singapore has been grappling with a steady decline in its Total Fertility Rate (TFR) over the last three decades.

Ousted President Assad allegedly airlifted £200m of Syria’s wealth to Moscow: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/assads-cash-airlift-syrias-250-million-journey-to-moscow-amid-sanctions-and-war/articleshow/116352238.cms,"Bashar al-Assad

A lifeline from Moscow

A sanctuary for Ill-Gotten Gains

The regime’s double play: Military support and financial hiding

Sanctions evasion: A systematic approach

A broken system of governance

In a stunning revelation, Bashar al-Assad’s regime airlifted around $250 million in cash to Moscow between 2018 and 2019, underscoring the deepening financial ties between Syria and Russia during the Syrian Civil War. The transactions, involving nearly two tonnes of $100 bills and €500 notes, highlight the lengths to which Assad’s regime went to bypass Western sanctions and secure its survival with the Kremlin’s support.As per the report by the Financial Times, the records showed the Syrian central bank's flights to Moscow’s Vnukovo airport, where the cash was deposited at Russian banks under Western sanctions. While Syria faced a dire shortage of foreign currency, Russia became a crucial financial lifeline, with these transfers spanning from March 2018 to September 2019.As the Assad regime faced increasing isolation and economic hardship, Russia emerged as an essential partner in both military and financial terms. Assad’s reliance on Russian military support, including aid from Wagner group mercenaries, allowed him to maintain his grip on power. But it wasn’t just military hardware flowing from Russia to Syria—cash was also in transit. In May 2019, a plane carrying $10 million in $100 bills landed in Moscow. Earlier that year, the central bank also flew €20 million in €500 notes.These airlifts were part of a broader effort to circumvent international sanctions that had crippled Syria’s economy and pushed it out of the global financial system. By 2018, Syria’s foreign reserves were practically nonexistent, forcing the central bank to rely on cash for transactions with foreign entities, including buying wheat from Russia and paying for military expenses, as reported by the Financial Times.The move to deposit large sums of cash in Russian banks was hardly surprising, according to David Schenker, former US Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs. Schenker explained that the Assad regime has long sent money abroad, both to safeguard illicit wealth and maintain control over Syria’s limited resources. “The regime would have to bring their money abroad to a safe haven to be able to use it to procure the fine life… for the regime and its inner circle,” he said, as quoted by the Financial Times.Eyad Hamid, a senior researcher at the Syrian Legal Development Programme, echoed this sentiment, pointing out that Russia had long served as a hub for the Assad regime to evade sanctions. Moscow’s role as a financial sanctuary for Assad is critical, especially considering that Western sanctions cut off Syria from the global banking system.Assad’s survival in power was not only secured by Russian airstrikes and military aid but also by the flow of illicit money, much of which found its way into luxury assets, including real estate, in Moscow. The Assad family’s extended wealth was not confined to Syria; it had extended its reach into Russia’s property market, purchasing high-end real estate through various proxies and middlemen.This came at a time when Syria’s economy was devastated by years of war. Assad's extended family—particularly First Lady Asma al-Assad, a former JP Morgan banker—was deeply involved in controlling key parts of the country’s economy, including international drug trafficking and fuel smuggling, to generate much-needed revenue.Russian financial institutions like Financial Corporation Bank (RFK), a lender controlled by Rosoboronexport, and TsMR Bank, were implicated in receiving the cash from Syria’s central bank. Both banks have been sanctioned by the US Treasury, which accused them of facilitating illicit financial transfers for the Assad regime.In addition to Russia, Iran also played a crucial role in keeping Assad afloat. Corporate records show that Assad’s key economic advisor, Yassar Ibrahim, was deeply involved in companies connected to Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps and Hezbollah, which facilitated the movement of hundreds of millions of dollars to Syria. Despite the overwhelming international pressure, Assad’s inner circle managed to continue funneling assets to Russia and other safe havens, circumventing the sanctions that had crippled the country’s official economy.As the regime's financial and military dependency on Russia grew, Assad's internal network of loyalists turned Syria into a breeding ground for corruption. The country's wealth, already looted during the conflict, was further siphoned off by the ruling elite, with regime insiders securing financial empires both domestically and abroad. According to Hamid, “corruption under Assad was not a marginal affair or a side effect of the conflict. It was a way of government.”For the Assad regime, Russia has not only been a military ally but also a crucial financial lifeline that allowed it to evade international scrutiny and continue its brutal war efforts. With no sign of Western sanctions letting up, it seems Moscow will remain the key hub for Syrian finances—and the Assad regime’s lifeline—amid the ongoing conflict.","Bashar al-Assad's regime airlifted around $250 million in cash to Moscow between 2018 and 2019.

Motorists choke as dust blankets traffic-heavy IRR in Bengaluru,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/motorists-choke-as-dust-blankets-traffic-heavy-irr-in-bengaluru/articleshow/116351905.cms,"BENGALURU: Slow moving traffic coupled with dust have rendered the Intermediate Ring Road a nightmare and a health concern for two-wheeler riders and pedestrians. Two of the worst spots on the stretch are at the Ejipura signal and Sony World signal.""I have started taking alternative routes to reach my office in Koramangala,"" said Dan K, a resident of Rustom Bagh, Outer Ring Road. ""Each day, I commute 7.5km stretch and although my alternative route has more signals, I reach office at least 20 minutes faster. The other road has been horrible for over three months, with a lot of dust closer to Sony World signal. That the short duration of the green light there only makes the spot more horrible for motorists,"" he said.Arjun J, operations manager at a startup, who travels 80km a day in the city, said the dust on IRR is bad enough for him to choose travel by car instead of a bike. ""The signals and bad road are responsible for the crawling traffic - just 10 vehicles are able to pass when the signal turns green,"" he said.The motorists say the IRR median, having turned into a dumpster, could be another factor contributing to the dust. They say the dust only worsens the situation for motorists who are forced to move slowly as the under-construction flyover has narrowed down the road width.Arpit Bhayani, a software engineer, who resides in Ejipura, adds: ""The Ejipura signal towards Domlur on the left side has holes dug up for some pipeline and after the work, the pavement was never re-laid. People have also started throwing garbage there. We have been seeing this for a month at least now.""He said, ""The one-kilometre stretch of IRR from Koramangala to Domlur now has four new speed-breakers, leading to more congestion.
