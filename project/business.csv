NEW DELHI: In a special briefing by the ministry of external affairs (MEA) on Friday, ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's overseas visit, foreign secretary Vikram Misri responded to a query about the extradition of Tahawwur Rana from the US.During the briefing, foreign secretary Misri said, ""On the extradition of Tahawwur Rana, from recent developments, you would be aware that Mr Rana has exhausted all legal avenues in the United States with the US Supreme Court also dismissing his appeal and therefore we are now in touch with US authorities to work on the logistics of his surrender to Indian authorities"".He added, ""We will update you as soon as we hear further on this particular matter"".The developments comes ahead of the Prime Minister's visit to the United States.""The visit will be a valuable opportunity to engage the new administration on all areas of mutual interest"", Misri said.Foreign secretary Vikram Misri also mentioned that PM Modi and US President Donald Trump would hold bilateral meetings in both restricted and delegation-level formats, with senior US administration figures expected to meet the prime minister during the visit.""The fact that the Prime Minister has been invited to visit the US within barely three weeks of the new administration taking office shows the importance of the India-US partnership and is also reflective of the bipartisan support, that this partnership enjoys in the US,"" he added.Earlier, during a press briefing, ministry of external affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal had said that the Indian side was working with the US on procedural issues for the early extradition of Tahawwur Rana to India.You would have seen that on January 21, the US Supreme Court declined a petition from the accused. With that looks that his appeal in the matter has been dismissed. We are now working with the US side on procedural issues for early extradition to India of the accused in the Mumbai terror attack,"" Jaiswal said.On January 28, the US state department said that it is currently evaluating the next steps regarding Tahawwur Rana's extradition to India.A spokesperson from the state department told that the US has long supported India's efforts to bring to justice the perpetrators of the 26/11 Mumbai attacks case.""In view of the recent Supreme Court decision, and consistent with applicable US law, the Department of State is currently evaluating next steps in this case,"" the statement said.""We have long supported India's efforts to ensure the perpetrators of the Mumbai terrorist attacks face justice,"" the statement added.Pakistani-origin businessman Tahawwur Hussain Rana, who was convicted for his role in the 26/11 attacks on Mumbai, which resulted in the deaths of 164 people, may now be extradited to India.Rana's co-conspirators included David Headley, who pleaded guilty and cooperated against Rana.On January 21, the US supreme court denied a petition for a writ of certiorari filed by Rana, seeking to prevent his extradition to India. The petition, filed in November 2024, was against an earlier order of a lower court that had ruled in favor of his extradition. A writ of certiorari is a legal document that allows a higher court to review a case from a lower court.The 26/11 attacks resulted in the deaths of 174 people, including 20 security personnel and 26 foreigners, and over 300 others were injured in the horrific attacks that took place at Mumbai's Taj Hotel on November 26, 2008.","Tahawwur Hussain Rana, convicted for his role in the 26/11 attacks on Mumbai, may now be extradited to India.

When will your loan EMIs come down?

Loan EMI calculator after RBI MPC meet: Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Sanjay Malhotra on Friday announced the Monetary Policy Committee’s unanimous decision to cut the key repo rate by 25 basis points. Repo rate is the rate at which banks are able to borrow money from the RBI.A repo rate cut is always good news for home loan borrowers, since EMIs come down. But this time around, it’s a double bonanza for the middle class! With FM Nirmala Sitharaman having announced NIL income tax up to Rs 12 lakh income levels in Budget 2025, the relief in loan EMIs is the cherry on the cake.Experts say that come April 1, 2025, middle class and common man will enjoy the twin benefits of changes in income tax slabs and rates and lower EMIs.So how much will you save on EMIs? What does the income tax relief + lower EMIs combination mean for middle class monthly savings? And, importantly, when will your loan EMIs start coming down? We take a look:According to loan EMI calculations provided by BASIC Home Loan, an individual with a home loan amount of Rs 50 lakh and paying a current interest rate of 8.75% for a 30 year loan will see a reduction of around Rs 889/- per month in the EMI. The EMI amount will go down from Rs 39,335/- to Rs 38,446/-Also Read | Income Tax Slabs FY 2025-26 explained: 20 FAQs individual taxpayers should check to understand tax rates, income tax benefit under new tax regime The biggest takeaway for the middle class is the combined bonanza from income tax slab and rate changes under the new income tax regime and the prospect of lower EMIs in the coming months. In an analysis BankBazaar explains this better:“A salaried person with a gross income of Rs 25 lakh and a home loan of Rs 50 lakh (20 years, 9%, 12 EMIs paid by March), can hope to save a total of Rs 1.37 lakh in FY 2025-26. This will be through a combination of interest savings on the home loan rate reduction of 25 basis points and the tax savings from higher tax slabs from April 1,” says Adhil Shetty, CEO of BankBazaar.The analysis suggests that an individual under the new income tax regime with a gross salary of Rs 25 lakh will now possibly save up to Rs 11,461/- per month with the changes in income tax slabs, rates and the reduced interest rate on loan. This benefit could go up to Rs 13.389/- per month for an individual earning a gross salary of Rs 50 lakh.According to Vivek Iyer, Partner and Financial Services Risk Leader at Grant Thornton Bharat, the repo rate cut transmission will take about 3 to 4 months. “It may not be transmitted in full as banks would need to transmit it only to borrowers whose credit standing is good and hence on an overall portfolio basis it may vary from bank to bank,” Iyer told TOI.Also Read | Budget 2025 Income Tax calculator explained: Save up to Rs 1.1 lakh! How income tax slab changes will benefit taxpayers at different salary levels under new regime Atul Monga, Co-Founder and CEO, BASIC Home Loan also says that it will take some time for the repo rate cut relief to trickle down to loan borrowers.“The MPC’s decision to reduce the policy rate by 25 basis points to 6.25% is a strategic move to fuel economic growth by making borrowing more affordable. Both existing and new borrowers under floating rate loans stand to benefit from lower interest rates, improving loan affordability and accessibility. Fixed rate loan borrowers will remain unaffected from the rate cut,” Monga told TOI.“That said, banks and housing finance companies may take some time to fully transmit the benefits of this rate cut to borrowers, depending on their policies and rate cycle. Lenders have to reset their external benchmark lending rates at least once in 3 months. Borrowers will see benefits once the lenders resets their benchmark rates, which can vary depending on the lender and customer profile,” he explains.Also Read | Latest income tax slabs 2025-26: How much tax do individuals earning slightly above Rs 12 lakh have to pay? Marginal relief calculations explained","For a Rs 1 crore loan at current interest rate of 8.75%, the EMI will come down from Rs 84,450 to Rs 82,630. For a Rs 50 lakh loan at a 9.55% interest rate, the E MI will come out to Rs 41,315. The cut will take effect from April 1.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118010397,imgsize-101606,width-400,resizemode-4/118010397.jpg"

A historic moment for Delhi



The results for the 2025 Delhi Assembly elections are set to be announced on Saturday, February 8, marking a pivotal moment in the Capital's political landscape. The election, held in a single phase on February 5, saw over 15 million eligible voters casting their ballots across 70 Assembly constituencies.A total of 699 candidates, including 603 male and 96 female contenders, vied for the electorate's mandate.The stakes are high as the ruling Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ) seeks a fourth consecutive term, while the Bharatiya Janata Party BJP ) aims to reclaim power after nearly 27 years. The Congress , once a dominant force in Delhi politics, is hoping to regain some lost ground.The counting process will be conducted under strict security and transparency measures. 5,000 personnel have been deployed to ensure a smooth and fair counting process.The Returning Officer (RO) in each constituency will oversee the process, which includes the counting of Electronic Voting Machine (EVM) votes and Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) slips.Five VVPATs from each constituency will be randomly selected for verification to ensure accuracy.In case of a tie, the winner is decided by a draw of lots. A recount can be demanded by a polling agent if irregularities are suspected.The election has seen high-profile contests in several constituencies, with prominent leaders from AAP, BJP, and Congress locking horns:Exit polls have painted a mixed picture, with most predicting a BJP victory after nearly three decades. However, some projections suggest a close contest between the BJP and AAP, while the Congress is expected to play a minor role.A party needs 36 seats to form a majority in the 70-member Delhi Assembly. The BJP, which last governed Delhi in 1998, is projected to emerge as the single largest party, while AAP is expected to face a significant setback. The Congress, which ruled Delhi for 15 years until 2013, is hoping to recover from its dismal performance in the last two elections, where it failed to win a single seat.The 2025 Delhi Assembly elections are a crucial test for both AAP and BJP. AAP, led by Arvind Kejriwal, has been in power since 2015, winning 67 seats in 2015 and 62 seats in 2020. A victory would solidify Kejriwal's position as Delhi's leader and boost his national political profile. However, exit polls suggest that AAP may fall short of a majority, with the BJP poised to make a comeback.The BJP, under the leadership of Delhi BJP president Virendra Sachdeva , has campaigned aggressively, focusing on issues like pollution, water shortages, and infrastructure. The party has also accused AAP of corruption and mismanagement, while AAP has blamed the central government for obstructing its work.The Congress, led by Rahul Gandhi, has attempted to revive its fortunes by highlighting issues like the Yamuna water crisis and corruption allegations against AAP. However, the party's prospects remain bleak, with most exit polls predicting a marginal presence in the Assembly.The election has been marred by controversies, with AAP accusing the BJP of attempting to poach its candidates by offering Rs 15 crore and a ministerial position. Delhi’s Lt Governor VK Saxena has ordered an anti-corruption branch probe into the allegations. The BJP, in turn, has demanded that AAP retract its accusations or face legal action.A loss in Delhi could weaken AAP's position in other states like Punjab, Gujarat, and Goa.The party's national ambitions may suffer a setback, with its focus likely to shift back to Delhi.A victory for the AAP will establish Kejriwal's dominance in Delhi and enhance his political stature nationally.A victory would mark the BJP's return to power in Delhi after 27 years, ending AAP's dominance.The party's success in Delhi could bolster its position ahead of assembly elections in Bihar and ther states.A loss in Delhi will prove to be a major morale buster as heavyweight leaders like PM Modi and UP CM Yogi Adityanath campaigned extensively across the Capital.The Congress, which ruled Delhi for 15 years in a row till 2013, is striving to stage a comeback after failing to win a single seat in the previous two elections. An improvement in its performance could provide a much-needed morale boost.The party may use AAP's potential loss to regain its foothold in Delhi and other states.The 2025 Delhi Assembly elections are a historic moment for the capital, with the potential to reshape its political landscape. As the counting of votes begins on February 8, all eyes will be on the results to see whether AAP can secure a fourth term or if the BJP will make a triumphant comeback. The Congress, though a minor player, will be hoping to stage a revival. Whatever the outcome, the results will have far-reaching implications for the future of Delhi and Indian politics.","Exit polls suggest that AAP may fall short of a majority, with the BJP poised to make a comeback.

Exit poll track record: A look back



2013: Underestimating AAP's rise



2015: A landslide that no poll saw coming



2020: Polls more accurate, but still off the mark



NEW DELHI: With only two days between voting and results, debates over exit polls heated-up as two more surveys were released on Thursday, echoing earlier predictions. Aam Aadmi Party , however, dismissed all projections, arguing that pollsters have ""historically"" underestimated its performance.Most exit polls were released on Wednesday shortly after voting concluded in Delhi. They largely predicted a BJP comeback in the capital after 27 years, dealing a major setback to AAP, which has ruled for over a decade and remains a strong political force.AAP national spokesperson Reena Gupta cited past election trends, emphasising that exit polls had misjudged the party’s success in 2013, 2015, and 2020. ""Every time, AAP was predicted to win fewer seats than it actually did,"" she said. Senior leader Sanjay Singh went further, ridiculing the projections as ""surveys by massage and spa companies.""Kejriwal said in his post on X: ""These predictions are meant to shape political sentiment and weaken our party by causing defections.""Moreover, majority of pollsters have missed the mark in recent elections, including the 2024 Lok Sabha polls and state assembly elections in Haryana, Jharkhand, and Maharashtra.Exit polls in 2013 largely favoured the BJP, predicting an average of 35 seats—just short of a majority—while forecasting 17 each for AAP and Congress The actual results, however, saw AAP win 28 seats, BJP 32, and Congress just 8.The closest prediction came from Today’s Chanakya, which estimated AAP would win 31 seats. The party, propelled by the India Against Corruption movement, formed a short-lived government with Congress support before resigning over the Jan Lokpal Bill after 48-days of assuming power.Six exit polls in 2015 forecast an AAP victory but failed to grasp its scale. While the average prediction gave AAP 45 seats, the party stunned observers by winning 67.BJP scored just 3, and Congress was left with no legislators in the assembly.The highest estimate for AAP came from Axis My India at 53 seats, while India TV-CVoter predicted only 39. Most polls also overestimated BJP’s chances, with many projecting over 20 seats.By 2020, exit polls were more aligned with AAP’s dominance but still fell short of the final numbers. On average, they predicted 52 seats for AAP and 17 for BJP, while the actual results saw AAP win 62 and BJP secure 8. Congress, once again, failed to win a single seat.India Today-Axis My India provided the closest estimate, forecasting 59-68 seats for AAP. Meanwhile, Sudarshan News gave BJP its highest projected tally at 24-28 seats, though the party ultimately fell far below that mark.","Aam Aadmi Party dismissed all projections, arguing that pollsters have ""historically"" underestimated its performance.

Faces covered by masks, without any luggage and a few with backpacks, they were taken to Gujarat Police vehicles stationed at the airport and whisked away to their homes.Having paid Rs 75 lakh to Rs 1 crore to chase their 'US dreams', all they were left with were shattered dreams and mounting debts. All of them were deported under the 'catch and release' policy of Trump administration and were part of a larger group of 104 Indians who were sent back from the US this week.""My sister was handcuffed during the deportation. She hasn't talked much with us. She had gone to US on a tourist visa . We have no idea why she was deported,"" said Varun, brother of 29-year-old Khushbu Patel of Luna village in Vadodara. Many deportees, including Khushbu, chose to go incommunicado to avoid the intense social scrutiny.Of the 33 deportees, 18 were caught just as Trump took oath as the US president. They stepped on US soil on Jan 19 and 20 and walked straight into the hands of American authorities, sources said.All 18 are from north Gujarat, a region known as a hub for human smuggling operations . ""They were smuggled into US through Mexico border,"" said a source connected with human smuggling network. ""The smugglers pushed them to enter US way before Trump took the oath, fearing stricter immigration policies. But for some reason, they could not cross over in time. They were caught and marked for deportation almost immediately,"" the source added.Sources said the remaining 15 Gujaratis had been in US for periods ranging from one month to four years. They did not get permission to stay even though they sought asylum, citing political persecution. Some deportees like Jignesh Zala, a native of Gandhinagar, said illegal immigration was a traumatic experience that should never be attempted. He had crossed into US with his wife and 11-year-old twin daughters four months ago. ""We went from Delhi to Paris to Madrid to Salvador before reaching Mexico and crossing the border. We were sent back with hands and legs in cuffs. It was a traumatic experience for our entire family,"" Zala said on Thursday.","33 illegal immigrants, including 13 women and eight children, landed in Ahmedabad early Thursday from Amritsar after they were deported from US.

NEW DELHI: Exit polls have predicted an end to the 10-year rule of Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in Delhi with most of the pollsters giving BJP a majority in the February 5 elections. If these predictions hold true on February 8 when the votes are counted, it would mark BJP's return to power in the national capital after 27 long years.While the BJP helped by its NDA allies went all out to woo Delhi voters, the INDIA bloc was divided in this fight with allies AAP and Congress turning bitter rivals for this high-stakes battle.The campaign saw Congress and AAP target each other fiercely. Arvind Kejriwal all along alleged that the Congress was contesting these elections to help the BJP, while the grand old party questioned AAP's decade-long governance in the national capital.Congress, once a dominant political force in Delhi with a government under Sheila Dikshit’s leadership for 15 years, has lost much of its traditional voter base to Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party (AAP). Kejriwal, emerging from the India Against Corruption movement, won 28 seats in AAP’s 2013 debut outing. Much of these gains were made at the cost of the Congress. In 2015, AAP surged to a sweeping victory, claiming 67 seats and leaving Congress with no representation in the assembly.With the two parties contesting as rivals, a key question remains: Will a potential split between AAP and Congress pave the way for a BJP victory or Will AAP manage to ensure consolidation of Muslim and Dalit votes to block the BJP’s path again? Notably, the BJP has not fielded any Muslim candidate in Delhi.All eyes are now on the final results, which will be announced on February 8. Here's a look at how the fight between AAP and Congress could possibly help the BJP in some Delhi seats.In the last election, AAP had secured a strong lead in all 12 SC-reserved constituencies, leaving BJP trailing while Congress struggled to remain competitive.Right through the 2025 campaign, Rahul Gandhi made a strong pitch for greater representation of Dalits, backward communities, and tribals - the target groups which were traditionally with the Congress but had shifted to AAP in the last two elections.If Gandhi's caste-focused rhetoric attracts significant support from the targeted groups, potentially dividing the vote share between AAP and Congress, it could alter the result - especially in seats where margin of victory was slim. It could ultimately tip the scales in favor of the BJP.In Bawana, AAP won by 11,526 votes, while Sultan Pur Majra saw one of the biggest For instance, in Bawana (SC), Congress trailed AAP by only 11,526 votes, while in Sultan Pur Majra (SC), Congress was behind by a significant 48,052 votes. Mangol Puri (SC) also saw a close race, with Congress trailing by 30,116 votes. Similarly, in Karol Bagh (SC), Congress was behind by 31,760 votes, and in Patel Nagar (SC), the gap was 30,935 votes. In areas like Seemapuri (SC) and Gokalpur (SC), Congress had a narrow disadvantage of 56,108 votes and 19,488 votes, respectively.There are 12 seats with a strong Muslim voter base; historically, these voters have not been aligned with the BJP, making AAP and Congress their likely alternatives. Whether these votes consolidate or split could determine the final outcome of this high-stakes election.The voter turnout in Muslim-majority constituencies for the 2025 Delhi Assembly elections showed high participation.Seelampur recorded a high turnout of 68.70%, with a turnout close to Mustafabad, which had the highest turnout in northeast Delhi at 69%. Other constituencies with notable turnout include Sultanpur Majra (SC-reserved) at 68.30%, and Babarpur at 66%, which ranked well in northeast Delhi.Seelampur, with 57% Muslim voters, was once a Congress stronghold but was won by AAP in 2015 and 2020. This time, AAP’s Chaudhary Zubair Ahmad is contesting against Congress's Abdul Rehman, a sitting MLA who recently switched from AAP to Congress.Congress is also emerging as the main contender against AAP in Muslim-heavy seats such as Matia Mahal (60% Muslim voters), Ballimaran (50%), Okhla (52%), and Chandni Chowk (30%).Clearly, many of these seats will be under close watch of all the stakeholders tomorrow when the votes are counted. We will have to wait for the actual results to find out if Congress has indeed damaged the prospects of AAP in these elections.","Pollsters give BJP a majority in the February 5 elections. If these predictions hold true on February 8 when the votes are counted, it would mark BJP's return to power in the national capital after 27 long years. Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has been in power for 10 years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118014832,imgsize-1981646,width-400,resizemode-4/118014832.jpg"

Note

2020

NEW DELHI: Two more exit polls for Delhi assembly elections, Axis My India and Today's Chanakya, on Thursday predicted clean sweep for the Bharatiya Janata Party and placed Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) at a distant second. AAP has categorically dismissed the exit poll results stating that pollsters have ""historically"" underestimated its performance.Most exit polls predicted a comeback for BJP in Delhi after 27 years and a big setback for the ruling AAP.AAP national spokesperson Reena Gupta said the exit polls have consistently underestimated the Arvind Kejriwal-led party, and in reality, the party often outperforms these projections.""Look at any exit poll from 2013, 2015, or 2020 – the AAP was always predicted to win fewer seats. But we ended up securing many more in the actual results,"" Gupta said.Senior AAP leader and Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh also dismissed the projections, calling them ""surveys by massage and spa companies"".: Exit polls are just projections made by election survey agencies based on interviews of voters as they come out after casting their votes. They might not hold true on the day of results. The Election Commission will announce Delhi assembly results on February 8.In 2013, an average of four exit polls placed BJP in a strong position, predicting 35 seats, just one shy of a majority. They forecast AAP and Congress each securing 17 seats. However, the actual results saw the BJP winning 32 seats, AAP securing 28, and Congress just 8. The exit polls significantly underestimated AAP’s rise, with the party building on the India Against Corruption movement. With support from Congress, AAP formed government that lasted only 48 days, before Kejriwal resigned over the failure to pass the Jan Lokpal Bill and Delhi was placed under President’s Rule.Two exit polls — Headlines Today-ORG and ABP-Neilsen—overestimated BJP's strength, predicting 41 and 37 seats, respectively. All four polls also overestimated Congress's performance, predicting it would win in double digits. The most accurate exit poll was Today's Chanakya, which predicted AAP would win 31 seats, BJP 29, and Congress 10. On average, the polls were off by 11 seats for AAP, while giving three additional seats to the BJP and nine extra to Congress.In 2015, six exit polls predicted an outright AAP victory, but none could foresee the extent of its triumph. The average of these polls estimated AAP would win 45 seats, BJP 24, and Congress just one. In reality, AAP won 67 seats, leaving BJP with just three. No exit poll predicted that AAP would exceed 60 seats, and only one, Axis My India, predicted the party would win over 50 seats, estimating 53. The lowest estimate came from India TV-CVoter, which projected 39 seats for AAP.For the BJP, exit polls suggested a much stronger performance, but not enough to challenge AAP. All but one poll predicted BJP would secure more than 20 seats, with Axis My India’s estimate of 17 seats being the lowest. Two agencies, Today's Chanakya and Axis My India, correctly predicted that Congress would fail to win any seats. However, other polls were more optimistic about Congress, with India Today-Cicero projecting it would win four seats, its highest estimate. The average of the six exit polls was off by 22 seats for AAP and predicted BJP would win 21 more seats than it actually did.By 2020, with 10 exit polls conducted, predictions for a strong AAP victory were once again widespread, with an average forecast of 52 seats for AAP, 17 for BJP, and just 1 for Congress.However, AAP performed even better, securing 62 seats, while BJP managed only 8. The Times Now-Ipsos exit poll was the first to report, predicting 47 seats for AAP and 23 for BJP. The India Today-Axis My India poll predicted between 59 and 68 seats for AAP, and 2 to 11 seats for BJP.Sudarshan News predicted 24-28 seats for BJP, the highest projection for the party by any agency. However, AAP was expected to win only 41-45 seats according to Sudarshan News. The ABP News-C voter exit poll projected between 49 and 63 seats for AAP, and 5 to 19 seats for BJP, while the Republic TV-Jan Ki Baat exit poll predicted between 48 and 61 seats for AAP, and 9 to 21 for BJP.India TV projected 44 seats for AAP and 26 for BJP. In the 2015 elections, AAP secured a historic mandate, winning 67 out of 70 seats, with BJP taking just 3 and Congress failing to open its account.Despite some improvement in exit poll accuracy in 2020, the predictions still undershot AAP’s electoral performance, which solidified the party’s dominance in Delhi politics.","Most exit polls predicted a comeback for BJP in Delhi after 27 years and a big setback for the ruling AAP.

The Coast Guard, in turn, is taking part with 10 ships and aircraft.The warships and aircraft are put through complex maritime operational scenarios to validate and refine the “concept of operations, including forward deployed sustenance and interoperability” in the IOR, which is witnessing growing maritime collusiveness between China and Pakistan after the land borders.With the world’s largest navy with over 360 warships and submarines, China deploys seven to eight naval vessels and spy ships in the IOR at any given time. It is working to increase its “underwater domain awareness” in the region by mapping oceanographic and other data useful for navigation and submarine operations.Concurrently, China is helping Pakistan build a bigger naval force, having already delivered four Type 054A/P multi-role frigates to Islamabad, with eight Yuan-class diesel-electric submarines and other assets in the pipeline.“These eight new submarines will add significant combat potential to the Pakistan Navy. We are fully aware of their capabilities. That is why we are tweaking our plans and concepts to negate any infringement of our interests. We are fully ready to take on any challenge,” Navy chief Admiral Dinesh K Tripathi had said earlier.","India is conducting a massive naval combat exercise, with 65 warships, nine submarines and over 80 aircraft and helicopters.

NEW DELHI: Narcotics Control Bureau seized grade-A cocaine worth over Rs 100 crore besides cannabis gummies and hydroponic ganja in one of the largest such hauls in recent times, dealing a blow to an international drug cartel operating in India.The successful operation earned praise from home minister Amit Shah, who posted on X: ""Bharat crushes drug cartels with zero tolerance.A major breakthrough in Mumbai in seizing very high-grade cocaine, ganja, and cannabis and arresting four people. It is a testament to success of the top-to-bottom approach to investigation adopted to make PM Modi's vision for a drug-free India a reality. Congratulations to Narcotics Control Bureau on this massive success.""The operation was the culmination of a probe that worked backwards with leads from a small 200 gm seizure of cocaine from an international parcel in Mumbai last month. According to NCB, its Mumbai unit made an initial recovery of 200 gm cocaine from a courier agency, which was in a parcel destined for Australia. The leads thrown up were developed through technical and human intelligence, and NCB Mumbai zonal unit was able to backtrack the supply to the bulk quantity, which was concealed at Navi Mumbai.NCB said the probe revealed that the syndicate behind the contraband is being operated by a group of people based abroad, with some of the seized quantities sourced from US and sent to multiple receivers in India and abroad through courier/small cargo services & human carriers.

The initiative is targeted at nearly one crore platform workers across India, a govt source said on Friday.Under the scheme, each gig worker will be assigned a universal account number, enabling deductions based on wage transactions across multiple platforms. Employers will contribute on a per-bill basis. ""Discussions with state govts are underway, and the scheme will soon be sent for cabinet approval,"" the source added.The initiative addresses the challenge of determining employer responsibility due to gig workers' engagement with multiple platforms.

As of Jan 27, 30.6 crore workers have registered on the platform, which integrates 12 social security schemes.According to a 2022 NITI Aayog report, India had 77 lakh gig workers in 2020-21, with number now exceeding 1 crore. Currently, 47% of gig jobs are medium-skilled, 22% high-skilled, and 31% low-skilled.The Social Security Code, 2020, proposed a National Social Security Board to recommend schemes for gig workers.

British Navy for first time allows female personnel to wear saris at mess dinners,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/british-navy-for-first-time-allows-female-personnel-to-wear-saris-at-mess-dinners/articleshow/118038603.cms,"LONDON: The Royal Navy has announced its personnel will now be allowed to wear cultural dress such as saris as part of their formal dress code to make its uniform policy more inclusive.Personnel are now permitted to wear saris, salwar kameez, lehengas and other cultural dress, beneath their mess jackets at formal mess dinners following lobbying by the UK service’s race diversity network. They will also have to wear a black bow tie and white shirt on top of the sari to maintain existing standards of identifiable naval uniform above the waist. This is how it is with the wearing of kilts and tartan dresses.The new cultural mess dress policy applies to anyone in the Royal Navy (RN) entitled to wear mess kits and is only applicable at formal mess dinners.An RN spokesperson told TOI: “Wearing cultural mess dress is an established tradition within the Royal Navy and personnel of Scottish, Irish, Welsh, Cornish and Manx (relating to Isle of Man) heritage have been permitted to wear a kilt for some years as part of the uniform. We have extended this recently to include other types of cultural dress below the waist. We are proud to welcome people from a variety of backgrounds.”Lance Cpl Jack Kanani, chair of the RN race diversity network, announced the new policy on Linkedin with a photo of British Pakistani Hon Capt Durdana Ansari wearing a white sari beneath a mess jacket, with a shirt and bow tie. Existing RN cultural mess dress policy had been updated to “include wider forms of British cultural identity,” he wrote. “The network canvassed opinions from ethnic minority service personnel to understand how widening existing policy on cultural mess dress would made them feel able to celebrate both their RN and cultural heritage,” he added.His post sparked strong reactions on Linkedin with some veterans saying the point of the armed services is to look the same, be the same, feel the same and fight the same, and this is “woke culture gone too far”. Others praised the initiative, saying it allowed people to keep their cultural and religious identity and serve.Rear Admiral Philip Mathias (Retd) wrote: “The reason for uniform in a disciplined fighting service is to achieve a common identify, not to accentuate the differences. Having commanded in two wars/conflicts, I would be more interested in the RN leadership focusing on instilling a culture of war fighting, rather than obsessing about DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion).”","Royal Navy personnel allowed to wear saris, salwar kameez, lehengas and other cultural dress beneath mess jackets at formal mess dinners.

Theare eyeing a potential buyout acquisition to reinforce their backcourt and support their star-studded duo of Stephen Curry and Jimmy Butler . With the Warriors recently adding Butler to the roster in a multi-team deal, they may look to bolster their guard depth after losing Dennis Schröder , who was valuable as a distributor and ball handler.The latest player to make waves on the buyout market is, a 34-year-old point guard who could be the perfect addition for Golden State. After winning an NBA championship with the Denver Nuggets in 2023, Jackson had a brief stint with the Philadelphia 76ers before being traded to the Washington Wizards. Shortly after the February 6 trade deadline, the Wizards waived Jackson, leaving the Golden State Warriors with a legitimate opportunity to sign him.As Clutch Points’ Brett Siegel highlighted,Reggie Jackson has previously played for several teams, including the Oklahoma City Thunder, Detroit Pistons , Los Angeles Clippers, and Nuggets, earning a reputation for his scoring ability and quickness to the rim as a primary ball handler.While Reggie Jackson may not return to his days with the Pistons, where he averaged 16.0 points per game, he brings valuable experience and leadership as a 14-year NBA veteran. His scoring prowess and ability to handle the ball could make him a reliable backup for the Golden State Warriors , especially as they aim to complement Curry and Butler’s $208 million worth of star power.Despite not being known for his efficiency, Jackson’s vast experience makes him an attractive option for Golden State, especially as they look to fill the void left by Schröder. The Golden State Warriors have long thrived on their depth, and Reggie Jackson’s ability to contribute meaningful minutes off the bench could be just what they need.Jackson might soon be seen wearing a Golden State uniform, which would bring even more quality to the team's already strong roster, while the NBA community observes.Also read: NBA Trade Rumor: Los Angeles Lakers’ master plan could land $175.3 million Milwaukee Bucks star and pair him with Luka Doncic in 2027 Let us know in the comments down below if you feel Reggie Jackson can replace ex-Warriors star Dennis Schröder.","The Golden State Warriors are looking to bolster their guard depth after losing Dennis Schröder.

Tourism minister Rohan Khaunte has instructed the tourism director to initiate an enforcement drive to regulate the operations of shacks, water sports, adventure activities, and other tourism-related activities. Khaunte said the department will not tolerate Goans subletting their shacks to “Delhiwallahs” and outsiders.“Using technology, we will go to the next level and ensure each shack is monitored. From Mandrem to Calangute to the south, mapping has started,” said Khaunte.He said that shack operation was a traditional business of locals and that it “must remain with Goans”. He said the tourism department simplified the allotment process, agreed to all the demands of the Shack Owners Welfare Society , and issued permissions for shacks well in advance with the “belief that a Goan will not give away his own business” to a “Delhiwallah come here to make money”.The minister said that enforcement drives will be continuous. He also said Goan shack operators finding it unviable to operate the allotted shacks should surrender them so that those on the waiting list get a chance. “These Delhiwallahs come here to make money and these incidents happen. We have been very clear that these businesses cannot be allowed to be taken over by outsiders,” said Khaunte.Speaking about paragliding activities, Khaunte said extreme adventure sports are fraught with risks, which tourists and enthusiasts need to understand and accept. “Adventure activities come under extreme sports and such extreme sports will always have some danger. There needs to be safety standards in place. People are illegally doing it in panchayat areas. If there are safety standards and all permissions, anyone can come to the director and get an NOC,” said Khaunte.","Tourism minister Rohan Khaunte has instructed the tourism director to initiate an enforcement drive to regulate the operations of shacks, water sports, adventure activities, and other tourism-related activities.

""Several couples in live-in relationships are facing threats from families. They approach constitutional courts seeking protection. Courts are inundated with such petitions. Every day dozens of petitions are submitted,"" the judge noted.Given the differing opinions of coordinate benches, Justice Dhand said it was necessary to refer the matter to a special bench for a definitive ruling.

'Bone glue' craze driving tiger poaching in central India; MP poacher arrested,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/bone-glue-craze-driving-tiger-poaching-in-central-india-mp-poacher-arrested/articleshow/118048644.cms,"Delhi Seats: 70 L + W Majority: 36 BJP 0 AAP 0 CONG 0 OTH 0 Source: PValue

MP tiger force has joined probe into poaching racket

BHOPAL: ' Tiger bone glue ' is turning out to be the biggest worldwide threat to the endangered species , and the dense landscapes of central India - including Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra - are at the heart of this growing illegal trade.'Tiger bone glue' is made by pressure-cooking tiger bones for two-three days. The finished product is a brown, sticky sap-like substance that is sold in the form of cakes.It's used in traditional medicine and is believed to cure muscle-and-bone ailments, increase vigour and is also used as an aphrodisiac.The demand for 'Tiger bone glue' is rising so rapidly that even illegal tiger 'farms' in China, Vietnam - where it's called 'cao ho' - and other parts of Southeast Asia are unable to match, said an officer. ""Besides, buyers are willing to pay a hefty premium for 'bone glue' of wild tigers as it is believed to be more potent,"" said a wildlife expert who has been tracking the trade for years. Asked why wild tigers are preferred, he remarked: ""Think of the difference between broiler chicken and desi murga.""And this is where prime tiger territory in Central India turned into a target for international poachers.This was revealed after the recent bust of what forest officials call 'the country's largest poaching network'. Transactions of crores of rupees have been unearthed and linked to a gang of nomadic poachers run by MP-based Ajit Rajgond and an international syndicate, said officers.The gang, arrested in Maharashtra last week, hunted tigers and leopards across India on the command of unidentified handlers, sources say. Officials haven't said how many tigers were poached by this gang, but one officer said it was ""shockingly high"".The identity of the syndicate's kingpin remains a mystery, but sources say the poaching network's connections extend to neighbouring countries. Officers are trying to connect the dots. A team from MP's Special Tiger Strike Force (STSF) has joined a multi-agency investigation into this global criminal trade spanning India, China and Vietnam.""We have sent our team to Maharashtra and they are working in close coordination with local teams. The gang members were already wanted in poaching cases in MP,"" said APCCF (wildlife)L Krishnamurteey.Wildlife experts say 'bone glue' has become the primary driver in poaching of tigers and leopards. Investigators have tracked the arrested poachers' mobile phone locations near areas around protected forests with dense tiger populations.Wildlife activist Ajay Dubey is preparing to file a PIL for a CBI inquiry due to its international ramifications.Krishna Acharya, general secretary of South Asia Wildlife Enforcement Network ( SAWEN ), shared his concerns with TOI, saying, ""I am deeply worried by the alarming findings in World Wildlife Crime Report 2024, which highlight the persistent and evolving threats posed by illegal tiger bone trade. The increasing demand for tiger bone glue, particularly in Vietnam, is driving illegal poaching, trafficking, and exploitation of substitute species like lions and jaguars.""Processing of tiger bone glue is shifting to source countries, further complicating enforcement, he said. ""Despite global efforts, the illicit trade in wildlife products continues to rise, undermining international conservation goals. We urgently need stronger enforcement, transnational legal frameworks under UNTOC, and targeted demand-reduction campaigns to address this crisis. Without decisive action, we risk repeating history and pushing wild tigers toward extinction. The time to act is now,"" he asserted.Acharya pointed out that a 2024 report revealed that nearly 45% of consumers in Vietnamese urban centres admitted to using tiger bone glue, despite the lack of scientific evidence supporting its efficacy. Between January 2000 and June 2022, authorities worldwide confiscated parts equivalent to approximately 3,377 tigers, averaging about 150 tigers per year. The first half of 2022 saw a significant increase in seizures in countries like Indonesia, Thailand, and Russia, signalling a potentially escalating illegal trade.A 2024 report by TRAFFIC highlighted a 185% increase in the number of tigers confiscated in Vietnam between 2018 and 2021. Given the country's minimal wild tiger population, these seizures likely originated from illegal imports or captive facilities. Additionally, between June 2021 and July 2023, a study showed widespread availability of products from endangered species, including tigers, across major e-commerce and social media platforms in Vietnam.""Research indicates that Vietnamese consumers prefer tiger bone glue derived from wild tigers over farmed ones, believing it to be more potent. This preference perpetuates poaching and illegal trade,"" said the SAWEN member.A major breakthrough in India's largest poaching network came on Jan 25, when Maharashtra forest department arrested a notorious tiger poaching gang based in MP's Katni. The arrest followed intelligence reports tracking the movement of a suspect from north India to their camp.The gang's leader, Ajit Rajgond, and his family members were apprehended in Bamanwada village near Rajura town.","MP tiger force has joined probe into poaching racket.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

* IT, Auto stocks shine

* Q3 results season starts

* Positive global cues

* China stocks rise

* Rupee gains

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

The revised income tax slabs were announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman in her Union Budget 2025 speech. The most important takeaway from the new income tax rules for the upcoming financial year is that individuals earning up to Rs 12 lakh will have to pay ZERO tax. For salaried individuals, once the standard deduction of Rs 75,000 under the new tax regime is counted, this income level goes up to Rs 12.75 lakh.Additionally, across the board income tax slab changes mean that individuals under the new tax regime, will now have to pay lower taxes, even at income levels above Rs 12 lakh. There is also the concept of marginal relief, which allows individuals earning just above Rs 12 lakh to not pay taxes more than their additional income.The total tax benefit of slab rate changes and rebate at different income levels can be illustrated with examples:Confused about the new income tax slabs and rates under the new tax regime?

Now he will be required to pay nil tax on such income.Yes, the limit of total income for NIL tax payments in the new tax regime has been increased to Rs. 12 lakhs in this budget provided the taxpayer files ITR to avail the rebate.Earlier the limit of income for nil tax payment was Rs 7 lakh.

For example, for a person having income of Rs 12,10,000/-, in the absence of marginal relief, the tax, works out to be Rs. 61,500/- (5% of Rs 4 lakhs + 10% of Rs 4 lakh and 15% of Rs 10 thousand). However, due to marginal relief, the amount of tax to be actually paid is Rs 10,000/-.The tax liability on such tax payer by way of slabs only is Rs 61,500. How ever a person having Rs 12 lakh income pays nil tax. By providing marginal relief it has been ensured that the tax payable by a person having income marginally above Rs 12 lakhs is required to pay only marginal amount of tax equal to the amount of income above Rs 12 lakhs so that his carry home is also Rs 12 lakhs. In this case he will be required to pay a tax of Rs 10,000.The marginal relief is computed in the following manner:-(i) First the tax as per slab rate is computed on the total income. For e.g. In the answer given to question no.15 above, tax on the total income of Rs 12,10,000/-shall be computed in following steps:(ii) Tax payable on total income of Rs 12,00,000/- on which rebate is available is Nil.(iii) Now the tax liability without marginal relief (in this case Rs 61,500) shall be compared with amount exceeding total income upto which rebate is available [in this case Rs 10,000, [i.e. Rs 12,10,000 - Rs 12,00,000](iv) The marginal relief shall be computed by deducting the income exceeding Rs 12, 10,000 (i.e. Rs 10,000) from total tax liability determined in this case (i.e. Rs 61,500) as tabulated above.(v) Therefore, in the above case rebate by way of marginal relief is Rs 51,500 (61,500/- 10,000/- = 51,500/-) is allowed.(vi) Tax payable is therefore Rs 10,000 [Rs 61,500 - Rs 51,500]Also Read | Budget 2025 Income Tax calculator explained: Save up to Rs 1.1 lakh!

Canada’s countermeasures

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has expressed concern that US President Donald Trump ’s repeated remarks about making Canada the 51st US state may not be a joke but a “real thing” driven by the country’s vast critical mineral resources .Speaking at a closed-door business summit in Toronto, Trudeau suggested that Trump is eyeing Canada’s resources as a strategic asset. “Mr Trump has it in mind that the easiest way to do it is absorbing our country.And it is a real thing,” Trudeau was heard saying before a microphone cut off, according to the news agency AP.Trump has made multiple public references to annexing Canada in recent weeks. In the Oval Office, when asked what Canada could do to avoid tariffs, he stated, “What I’d like to see, is Canada become our 51st state.” He also referred to Trudeau as “governor Trudeau” in several posts on his social media platform Truth Social.His administration recently threatened 25% tariffs on all Canadian exports, except energy, which would be taxed at 10%. Trump agreed to a 30-day reprieve on the tariffs after Canada pledged to bolster border security.Canada is home to 31 critical minerals vital for electric vehicle batteries , semiconductors, and clean energy technology. Of those, Canada has prioritised lithium, graphite, nickel, copper, cobalt, and rare earth elements in its strategy to lead the global transition away from fossil fuels, according to the New York Times.François-Philippe Champagne, Canada’s industry minister, emphasised that the US economy is deeply dependent on Canadian supply chains. “This is about a confident Canada,” he said.An Ipsos poll conducted in January found that 80% of Canadians oppose becoming part of the US, with many dismissing Trump’s comments as political bluster, according to BBC. However, Trudeau’s remarks suggest a shift in how Canada views the situation.To fend off tariffs, Canada has introduced a $1.3 billion CAD ($900 million USD) border security plan, which includes drones, helicopters, additional border guards, and a joint US-Canada task force. Trudeau also announced the appointment of a “fentanyl czar” to coordinate efforts, despite Canada contributing to less than 1% of fentanyl smuggling into the US, reported AP.“This is a moment. This is a time in our country’s history that really matters”, Trudeau said.With the 30-day tariff reprieve ticking down, Trudeau emphasized that Canada must be prepared for potential economic retaliation. “We need to be ready to respond robustly,” he said. “We also have to be ready to support Canadians through the responses we’re giving and through a difficult time of tariffs”.As tensions with the US escalate, Canadian business leaders are calling for less reliance on American trade. Candace Laing, President of the Canadian chamber of commerce, said businesses must diversify markets to avoid economic instability.“It’s clear that we can’t just tinker around the edges with incremental steps right now,” she said. “We’ve got to be bold so that businesses and communities can pivot to be more resilient and less reliant on what happens in the US”, she added as per AP.","Justin Trudeau warns Canada must take Donald Trump’s annexation talk seriously. “Mr Trump has it in mind that the easiest way to do it is absorbing our country.

US Transportation Secretary Duffy expresses willingness to allow Musk to restructure air traffic control,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-transportation-secretary-duffy-expresses-willingness-to-allow-musk-to-restructure-air-traffic-control/articleshow/118035289.cms,"Transportation Secretary Dean Duffy said that US aviation authorities are ready to allow DOGE chief Elon Musk to completely restructure the system.Duffy speaking on Fox's Hannity programme, expressed willingness to allow the efficiency-focused team to develop a fresh air traffic control system at ""the speed of business, not bureaucracy"", citing urgent modernisation needs.This announcement follows the most severe US airline disaster in nearly 25 years, where a Blackhawk helicopter's collision with an American Airlines aircraft resulted in 67 fatalities, including all passengers and crew members.Following his address at a state Department of Transport officials' conference on Wednesday, Duffy elaborated on his decision to involve the space entrepreneur. He informed the host that the Tesla and X executive believes a modernised aviation system could be implemented within just 12 months.""Sean, I was talking to Elon. I said, 'what can we do this in, Elon? Two and a half, three years, can we make this happen?' And he was like, 'No, no. Two and a half, three years. No. We could do this in one year'.""Duffy appears to welcome the involvement of Musk's DOGE team members. ""When you have these 22 year old young people who are smart and can engage and give us good advice, we'll move at the speed of business as opposed to the speed of bureaucracy and government,"" he said.Duffy suggested that Democrats' opposition stems from Musk's participation. ""We're using World War Two technology. And it should have been updated, you know, 10, 20, 30 years ago. And so, again, I think Democrats right now, they're upset about Elon Musk.""Meanwhile Rep.Tim Kennedy (D-N.Y.) expressed serious concerns about Musk's lack of expertise in air traffic control. He emphasised the poor timing, particularly following a recent tragic incident in Washington, DC, stating it would be unwise to grant authority to someone without relevant experience.Additionally, Rep Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), a Transportation Committee member, warned of increased aviation accidents and potential ground operation issues.However, Duffy defended Musk's potential involvement, citing his achievements in space technology, a view apparently shared by Donald Trump.","US Transportation Secretary Dean Duffy says he is ready to allow DOGE chief Elon Musk to completely restructure the system.

Condoms for Taliban to drag shows in Ecuador: Craziest USAID spends revealed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/condoms-for-taliban-to-drag-shows-in-ecuador-craziest-usaid-spends-revealed/articleshow/118003488.cms,"Representative image (Picture credit: AP)

hey liberals - watch this

1. $15 million for condoms for the Taliban

2. $446,000 to promote atheism in Nepal

3. $47,000 for a transgender opera in Colombia

4. $20,600 for drag shows in Ecuador

5. $350 million for a pier in Gaza

6. $1 million to boost French-speaking LGBTQ groups in Africa

7. $3 million for just “being LGBTQ” in the Caribbean

8. $55,000 for a climate change seminar in Argentina—only for female and LGBTQ journalists

9. $2 million for sex changes and LGBTQ activism in Guatemala

10. $425,000 to help Indonesian coffee companies become more “gender-friendly”

11) $32,000 for a transgender comic book in Peru

14) Millions to EcoHealth Alliance—tied to the Wuhan Lab

15) Hundreds of thousands of meals sent to al-Qaeda fighters in Syria

16) Hundreds of millions for Afghan Poppy cultivation

17) $14 million in cash vouchers for migrants at the Southern border

The US Agency for International Development (USAID) is facing heavy scrutiny after Trump administration crackdown.US President Trump, who has long criticised USAID, signed an executive order pausing foreign assistance for 90 days. “USAID is being run by radical lunatics,” he said, vowing to end what he calls “waste, fraud, and abuse.”Meanwhile, secretary of state Marco Rubio had called USAID a “global charity” that operates with little regard for US national interests. The agency’s Washington headquarters has been temporarily closed and several senior officials have been placed on leave as investigations continue.Recently, house foreign affairs committee chairman Brian Mast and the White House exposed a series of, what they referred to as “wasteful” expenditures under the Biden administration.From funding drag shows in Ecuador to providing cash vouchers for illegal migrants, USAID’s use of taxpayer dollars has raised major concerns about its accountability.Here are some of the spending decisions, that the committee termed as “outrageous”:Yes, you read that right. In the video, Representative Mast claimed that USAID allocated $15 million worth of condoms to the Taliban, an extremist group known for suppressing women's rights. He mocked this expenditure, stating, “I don’t think anybody’s going to die because we don’t give the Taliban any more condoms.”Through the state department, USAID funnelled nearly half a million dollars to promote atheism in Nepal.The US government spent tens of thousands of dollars to fund a transgender-themed opera in Colombia, a move that left many questioning its relevance to American interests.Another eyebrow-raising expenditure, USAID paid for drag performances in Ecuador as part of an LGBTQ cultural initiative. According to the foreign affairs committee, Fundación Diálogo Diverso, an LGBTQ organization in Ecuador, received nearly $75,000 over a period of three years, which includes a $25,000 grant from last year. The organization utilized those funds to host a two-day drag workshop and create a video documenting the event.This massive sum was spent to build a pier in Gaza, allegedly to facilitate humanitarian aid. However, critics argue that it could easily benefit terrorist groups like Hamas, according to The National Desk.Through the State Department, USAID funded LGBTQ activism in West and Central Africa with a $1 million grant, despite many African nations rejecting Western-imposed social policies.USAID reportedly spent $3 million to support LGBTQ individuals in the Caribbean with no clear explanation of how the funds were distributed or why the initiative was necessary.A USAID-funded climate seminar in Argentina had a strict requirement: participants had to be female or LGBTQ journalists, raising concerns about inclusivity and fairness.The White House disclosed that USAID provided $2 million to support sex reassignment surgeries and LGBTQ activism in Guatemala, a deeply conservative country.US Taxpayer money was used to promote gender inclusivity within Indonesian coffee businesses, sparking outrage over how such spending aligns with American interests.USAID spent $32,000 to create an LGBTQ-focused comic book in Peru. While it is likely meant to promote inclusivity, critics argue that funding a niche cultural project in South America is a waste of American taxpayer money.USAID has funnelled millions of dollars to EcoHealth Alliance, the organization linked to controversial coronavirus research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.According to The White House, USAID provided food aid that allegedly ended up in the hands of al-Qaeda-affiliated fighters in Syria. Critics argue this demonstrates the agency’s lack of control over where US funds actually go.USAID has reportedly spent hundreds of millions of dollars on irrigation canals, farming equipment, and fertilizer in Afghanistan—resources that directly benefited the Taliban’s heroin trade. The funding helped sustain one of the world’s largest opium networks, undermining US counter-narcotics efforts.While the US faces its own economic struggles, USAID allocated $14 million in cash vouchers to migrants at the southern border. Critics argue this policy incentivises illegal immigration and misuses taxpayer money that could be spent on domestic priorities.","The US Agency for International Development (USAID) is facing heavy scrutiny after Trump administration crackdown.

Determining the threat

Further details

Astronomers have identified a newly discovered asteroid with a small yet alarming chance of colliding with Earth in the next decade. The celestial traveller, named 2024 YR4, is nearly 200-foot-wide and has a 1.2 per cent probability of striking Earth on 22 December 2032 raising concerns about its potential impact, especially if it were to crash in a densely populated area.The space rock, discovered last year, is roughly the same size as the Tunguska asteroid, which in 1908 exploded over Siberia, flattening an estimated 80 million trees across 830 square miles and unleashing a blast equivalent to 50 million tons of TNT.Though the event resulted in only three reported deaths due to its remote location, scientists say that today, a similar impact could have a catastrophic effect, particularly over a major city.After a little less than a decade, 2024 YR4 is expected to pass within 66,000 miles of Earth.However, as the data about its current trajectory remains uncertain, the risk of impact could change in case more data is gathered about it.Due to its potential threat, 2024 YR4 has been added to Nasa’s Sentry risk list, which monitors hazardous near-earth objects (NEOs).Experts say that if 2024 YR4 enters Earth's atmosphere intact, it could either explode mid-air in a fiery air burst or crash into the ground, creating a massive crater. However, the extent of destruction relies on the asteroid’s composition and density, the details which have not been gathered by now.Initial calculations suggest that in case it does collide with Earth, the impact zone, known as the risk corridor—could stretch from South America across the Atlantic Ocean to sub-Saharan Africa, as per the Daily Mail.However, this projection is subject to change as astronomers refine the asteroid’s orbit.The asteroid was first detected on 27 December 2024 by Atlas (Asteroid terrestrial-impact last alert system), a Nasa-funded project that scans the sky for potential threats. Automated warning systems quickly flagged 2024 YR4 as a noteworthy object, rating it a 3 on the Torino risk scale, a level that warrants continued monitoring due to its close approach and over 1 per cent chance of impact.Finding out details about the exact size and composition of 2024 YR4 is difficult as it is currently moving away from Earth, making radar observations impossible. Scientists estimate its diameter at 196 feet, but this depends on its surface reflectivity, which remains unknown.Astronomers hope to study 2024 YR4 more closely when it passes within 5 million miles of Earth in 2028, potentially allowing for radar measurements. Until then, researchers must rely on indirect methods, such as brightness analysis, to refine their estimates.While the risk remains low, the asteroid's classification as a potential impactor has set off a scientific race to understand its true threat level before 2032.","The space rock, discovered last year, is roughly the same size as the Tunguska asteroid, which in 1908 exploded over Siberia, flattening an estimated 80 million trees across 830 square miles and unleashing a blast equivalent to 50 million tons of TNT. 2024 YR4 has been added to Nasa’s Sentry risk list, which monitors hazardous near-earth objects (NEOs)","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117720440,imgsize-1314043,width-400,resizemode-4/117720440.jpg"
