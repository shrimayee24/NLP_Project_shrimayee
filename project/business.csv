Opposition demand for JPC set to make Parliament winter session stormy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/opposition-demand-for-jpc-set-to-make-parliament-winter-session-stormy/articleshow/115547812.cms,"NEW DELHI: The upcoming winter session of Parliament from Nov 25, days after the high-stakes elections in Maharashtra and Jharkhand, is poised to be stormy with opposition likely to raise the indictment of Gautam Adani by US agencies.A pointer to likely turbulence came on Thursday when leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi demanded the setting up of a JPC to examine the allegations. The demand is unlikely to be accepted.""The leader of opposition in Lok Sabha will now start a drama when the Parliament's winter session begins and try to disrupt its proceedings and target the economy,"" BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said in what was seen as a pointer to the govt's stance.Some parties in opposition may not join in the stir, but that is unlikely to be a deterrent for Congress and others.The winter session was already set to be contentious with the opposition set to resist important business on govt's legislative agenda - a constitutional amendment bill to pursue the 'one nation, one election' plan and the Waqf (Amendment) Bill.The addition of the fresh Adani controversy will only charge the political atmosphere, making the session a focal point for both policy and political drama.Earlier, allegations by American shortseller Hindenburg Research of stock manipulation and accounting fraud had triggered a week of chaos in Parliament, with opposition demanding a debate and investigation.BJP, on its part, had previously managed to navigate these storms by either downplaying the opposition's demands or by rallying enough support to ensure business as usual. The indictment of Adani in the US marks a fresh challenge, especially with the political climate already charged by heated electioneering in Maharashtra and Jharkhand.",Opposition likely to raise the indictment of Gautam Adani by US agencies.

"Combination drugs more effective in BP treatment, says study",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/combination-drugs-more-effective-in-bp-treatment-says-study/articleshow/115547725.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a finding that could change the way hypertension is managed among Indians, a new study has shown that single pills containing a combination of Blood Pressure (BP)-lowering medications are safe and effective.It is important because conventional practice encourages initiating a patient on a single BP-lowering medication, increasing its dosage depending on whether BP is under control or not and, if both fail, introducing other combinations, Dr Ambuj Roy, professor of cardiology at AIIMS and co-lead of the study, said.In the study, carried out by AIIMS Delhi, Centre for Chronic Disease Control Delhi and Imperial College London, researchers assigned nearly 2,000 persons suffering from high BP to one of three treatment groups - to receive a single pill, often called a polypill, that included a combination of two commonly recommended medications .Each of the three participant groups was prescribed a pill combining two of these medications: an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (perindopril), which prevent the arteries from narrowing; calcium channel blockers (amlodipine), which prevent calcium from entering the heart muscle and arteries; and/or diuretics (indapamide), which help the body excrete excess salt and water.As per American Heart Association (AHA), the primary outcome measured 24-hour ambulatory systolic blood pressure after taking the pill daily for six months. The analysis found all three combinations lowered blood pressure equally, with about 70% participants achieving blood pressure below 140/90 mm Hg, statement says. More than 40% of participants achieved the strictertarget of less than 130/80 mm Hg, it adds.","Single pills containing a combination of Blood Pressure (BP)-lowering medications are safe and effective.

"High BP, irregular heartbeat up severe stroke risk: Study",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/high-bp-irregular-heartbeat-up-severe-stroke-risk-study/articleshow/115547690.cms,"NEW DELHI: If you have high blood pressure , irregular heartbeat or smoking habit, you may be at a higher risk of severe stroke.In comparison, a new study published in the journal Neurology suggests, people with other risk factors, for example diabetes, physical inactivity, stress and alcohol use, have a lower risk of severe symptoms if they were to suffer from the neurological condition.Stroke happens when blood supply to a part of the brain is cut off, either due to blockage in blood supply to the brain (ischaemic stroke) or leakage of blood from a burst vessel in the brain (haemorrhagic stroke). It can lead to complications such as difficulty swallowing, paralysis, memory loss, confusion and the loss of vision among others. The Neurology study says their findings emphasise the importance of hypertension control in stroke prevention , especially in lower- and middle-income nations that have rapidly increasing rates of hypertension and strokes at younger age.According to World Stroke Organisation , consistently high or elevated blood pressure makes the circulatory system - the heart, arteries and blood vessels - work harder at their job of moving blood around the body. ""This extra work causes damage that can make your blood vessels, including those in your brain, harder and narrower over time. This process, known as atherosclerosis, increases the risk of blockages in the blood vessels in your brain. If the blood supply to an area of the brain is cut off or restricted, it can lead to permanent brain damage, or death. Atherosclerosis can also increase the pressure the blood flows through blood vessels in the brain causing them to burst and bleed. This is called a hemorrhagic stroke which can also cause permanent damage to the brain or death,"" WSO explains.Dr Kameshwar Prasad, head of neurology division at Fortis Vasant Kunj, said high BP and smoking may cause severe stroke compared to other factors such as diabetes because they affect the large and medium-sized arteries in contrast to diabetes which has greater effect on small arteries. ""The message to public is that all adults should have BP checked at least once in two years and after 40 years of age once in a year to avoid a severe stroke,"" he said.Dr Prasad, who was with AIIMS earlier, carried out a survey in Delhi as part of their global study to identify the role of lifestyle, genetic changes and other factors behind stroke as well as dementia. It revealed nearly 70% of people over 50 years old have high BP. Smoking prevalence was found in 20% of the respondents. Dr Prasad said atrial fibrillation or irregular heartbeat was uncommon but its frequency is known to increase as age increases.The former AIIMS professor said timely administration of drugs to dissolve the clot can save many patients. ""Some patients may also benefit from minimally invasive surgery to remove the blood clot,"" he added.","Stroke happens when blood supply to a part of the brain is cut off.

In Gurgaon, mercury to drop by 2-4°C in two day

New Delhi: The city's air quality turned very poor on Thursday. Despite being toxic, it was still seen as an improvement since the city was suffering under severe AQI for the past five days.As the fog moved with shallow haze and a thin smog layer with winds up to 6-8 kmph, the city's air quality began to show some improvement since late Wednesday evening. The AQI was 376 at 11 am, which, despite light winds, managed to reach 372 by 3 pm. The air quality in some areas, however, remained within severe levels. GRAP-IV measures , meant for severe-plus AQI continued to be in place.The average AQI on Thursday was 371 against 418 a day earlier, which despite being a marginal improvement, was worse in the region as Greater Noida saw an AQI of 212, Noida 253, Gurgaon 298, Faridabad 320 and Ghaziabad 291.However, the improvement is unaccounted for since the pollution levels are still very high and way above the normal mark even as the city continued wearing a shroud of smog and toxic haze.According to weather analysts, chances of smog formation will be slightly less due to dry westerly winds; however, the air quality may not see substantial improvement either. ""The winds may catch up marginally, the city will see westerly winds which are dry so the moisture levels will remain low. Thus, smog formation may drop as well. However, due to the drop in the temperatures, dispersion of pollution would be marginal as well,"" said Mahesh Palwat, Vice Chairman, Climate Change and Meteorology, Skymet.The air quality early warning system expects AQI to remain very poor for the next few days. ""The ventilation index lower than 6000 m2/s with average wind speed less than 10 kmph is unfavourable for dispersion of pollutants.

The PM10 levels hovered between 289.6 and 321.3 microgram per cubic metre, against a national standard of 100 units and 45 units as per WHO standards.Meanwhile, the GRAP-IV measures continue to be in force since Monday, with a ban on construction activities barring essential projects. The entry of trucks also continues to be banned, except for those carrying essential items. Physical classes continue to be discontinued, with non-essential govt offices working at 50% strength.As the city woke up to a sunny day with light fog, the maximum temperature on Thursday reached 26.4 degrees Celsius, 1.2 degrees higher than Wednesday. The minimum temperature also increased slightly, settling at 11 degrees Celsius. It was recorded at 10.8 degrees the previous day.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) withdrew its 'yellow' alert for 'dense' to 'very dense' fog in the region.According to IMD's forecast, the minimum temperature may plummet by 2-4 degrees Celsius over the next two days.

Decoding US charges against Gautam Adani and others: 10 points,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/decoding-us-charges-against-gautam-adani-and-others-10-points/articleshow/115534659.cms,"Adani group head Gautam Adani (Image Credit: Adani's X account)

Why US authorities took action

Here is all you need to know about:

NEW DELHI: Gautam Adani and his conglomerate, the Adani Group , are at the center of a major legal and financial storm following an indictment by US prosecutors. The charges allege that Adani, his nephew Sagar Adani, and other associates orchestrated a $265 million bribery scheme to secure lucrative solar energy contracts in India. Between 2020 and 2024, the accused reportedly bribed Indian officials to gain business advantages while misleading US investors and financial institutions about their anti-corruption practices.The charges against Adani and others have been filed in the US District Court for the Eastern District of New York, a prominent federal court known for handling high-profile cases involving corporate fraud, securities violations, and international corruption. This court, based in Brooklyn, has jurisdiction over cases that involve violations of US federal law, especially those with connections to international financial systems and foreign bribery under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA).The prosecution is led by the US Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, Breon Peace, who oversees cases related to white-collar crimes, organized fraud, and cross-border offenses.The US indictment stems from the involvement of American investors and financial markets in the alleged fraud. Under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), US law prohibits companies from bribing foreign officials if their activities involve US financial systems or investors.In this case: Funds were raised from US investors and allegations pointed to fraudulent disclosures made in connection with securities offerings.1. What are the main allegations against Gautam Adani and the Adani Group?US prosecutors have charged Gautam Adani, his nephew Sagar Adani, and others with a $265 million bribery scheme to secure solar energy contracts in India. The indictment alleges that Adani Group executives paid bribes to Indian government officials between 2020 and 2024 and concealed these activities from US investors. The charges include securities fraud, wire fraud conspiracy, and misleading investors about anti-corruption practices.2. How did the alleged bribery scheme operate?The indictment details that executives used encrypted communication, mobile tracking, and coded language to discuss and execute the bribery plan. Bribes were calculated at approximately $30,000 per megawatt for solar projects and disguised as ""development fees."" In some instances, Azure Power, a related company, transferred projects to Adani Green Energy as part of the bribery scheme.3. What are the financial implications of the indictment on Adani Group companies?The charges have triggered a massive sell-off in Adani Group stocks, with the conglomerate losing about $27 billion in market value. Shares of Adani Enterprises fell by 23%, and Adani Green Energy declined by 19%. The group also canceled a $600 million bond offering due to the negative market reaction.4. What is the political fallout from these allegations in India?The indictment has intensified political tensions. Opposition leaders, including Rahul Gandhi, have called for Adani’s arrest and an investigation into his alleged ties with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Critics argue the case underscores a broader issue of corruption and favoritism within the Indian government, though the BJP denies these claims and emphasizes legal processes should take their course.5. What is the Adani Group’s response to the charges?The Adani Group has denied the allegations, calling them ""baseless"" and politically motivated. A group statement emphasized its commitment to governance, transparency, and regulatory compliance, asserting that it would seek all possible legal recourse to contest the charges.6. How were US federal authorities involved in the investigation?The US investigation included the FBI seizing electronic evidence from Sagar Adani in 2023 and uncovering extensive documentation of the bribery scheme, including PowerPoint presentations and encrypted communications. The US authorities have also issued arrest warrants for Gautam and Sagar Adani.7. What are the international implications of this case?This case has highlighted cross-border enforcement of anti-corruption laws, particularly the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). It also affects international investor confidence in Indian conglomerates, with Adani’s global reputation and access to capital markets now under significant scrutiny.8. How does this relate to previous allegations against Adani Group?The Adani Group faced similar scrutiny in 2023 when Hindenburg Research accused it of stock price manipulation and improper use of tax havens. While the group denied those allegations, the current indictment adds legal weight to concerns about its business practices.9. What role does Azure Power play in this case?Azure Power, formerly listed on the New York Stock Exchange, is implicated as a co-conspirator. Executives from Azure allegedly collaborated with Adani executives to plan and facilitate bribes. Azure has since stated that individuals named in the indictment are no longer associated with the company.10. What’s next for Gautam Adani and the Adani Group?Legal experts suggest Adani could pursue dismissal of the indictment or negotiate a settlement with US authorities. Meanwhile, Indian authorities may face pressure to initiate their investigations. Market analysts predict continued volatility in Adani Group stocks as the case unfolds.(With inputs from others)","Gautam Adani and his conglomerate, the Adani Group, are at the center of a major legal and financial storm.

Worst day since Hindenburg: Adani's US indictment wipes Rs 2.2 lakh crore in m-cap,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/worst-day-since-hindenburg-m-cap-crashes-2-2-lakh-crore/articleshow/115542252.cms,"MUMBAI: Adani Group companies recorded their worst trading day in terms of market value on Thursday since the Hindenburg crisis in early 2023. The conglomerate's combined market value slid by Rs 2.2 lakh crore after the US Department of Justice and the US Securities and Exchange Commission pressed widespread bribery charges against the group's chairman and main promoter Gautam Adani and several related entities.In comparison, on Jan 27, 2023 - two days after the US-based short seller Hindenburg Research had alleged corporate malfeasance against the group's companies and associated people - the group's market cap had dipped by Rs 3.2 lakh crore, a TOI analysis of BSE data showed. Thursday's development also left Gautam Adani poorer by $12.1 billion (about Rs 1 lakh crore), with the Gujarat-based businessman's net worth now down at nearly $58 billion, data from Forbes showed.Currently, Adani is the 25th richest billionaire in the list, which is topped by US innovator-cum-businessman Elon Musk with a personal net worth at close to $316 billion. Among Indians, Mukesh Ambani, chairman of Reliance Industries, is the richest with personal net worth of $96.5 billion.Among the Adani Group companies, flagship Adani Enterprises fell by nearly 23% while its market cap eroded by about Rs 73,600 crore. Other companies from the group saw a dip too, with Adani Green Energy's stock price falling by nearly 19% and its market value by about Rs 42,000 crore. Adani Green is at the center of the US DOJ's bribery allegations against the group's chairman and related entities.Among other stocks from the group, Adani Energy Solutions lost the maximum possible 20%, Adani Ports 13.5%, Adani Wilmar the maximum possible 10%, Ambuja Cements 12% and Adani Total Gas 10.4%, BSE data showed.At a media conference with Goldman Sachs's equity strategist for emerging markets during the day, the analyst at the financial major said that its team was watching developments at the Adani Group 'very closely'. The US DOJ indictments and the investigations by the US SEC against some of the group's top executives were 'bad for investor sentiment', he said. Among the Adani Group's stocks, Goldman Sachs has a 'buy' rating on Adani Ports & SEZ.Outside of the Adani Group stocks, leading indices were back on their sliding path on Thursday as the intensity of selling by foreign funds increased. The simmering geopolitical tension in Europe also weighed on investor sentiment, market players said.As the negatives from Adani group's stocks weighed on investor sentiment on Dalal Street, the sensex opened lower and briefly broke below the 77K mark to touch an intraday low at 76,803 points. At close, it was a tad higher from its earlier low and settled the session at 77,156 points, down 423 points. On the NSE, Nifty too treaded a similar path and closed at 23,350 points, down 169 points.""Indian stock indices experienced a significant decline on Thursday, pressured by bribery charges against Gautam Adani, which further weakened already fragile investor sentiment amid unfavourable global conditions,"" said Devarsh Vakil, deputy head (retail research), HDFC Securities.The day's selling was again led by foreign portfolio investors who recorded a net outflow of Rs 5,321 crore. In contrast, as has been the trend in recent weeks, domestic funds were net buyers at Rs 4,200 crore, BSE data showed. So far in the month, FPIs have net sold stocks worth nearly Rs 33,000 crore through the secondary market, official data showed.During the day, several banking stocks witnessed heavy selling pressure. According to Siddhartha Khemka, head of research (wealth management), Motilal Oswal Financial Services, some banking stocks came under heavy selling pressure as investors were concerned about their exposure to Adani Group companies.Among the larger banks, Bank of Baroda closed 3.6% lower, Canara Bank 3.3% and SBI was down 2.6%. BSE's bankex, the sector's index, however, was down a marginal 0.4% as most private sector banks ended with gains.The market is expected to remain volatile in the near term due to geopolitical concerns, FPI selling and uncertainty around the outcome of state assembly elections.",Adani Group companies recorded their worst trading day in terms of market value on Thursday since the Hindenburg crisis in early 2023.

In the counter-attack, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) also name-dropped George Soros to target the Congress leader.BJP IT cell head Amit Malviya slammed Gandhi for speaking the same language as George Soros and accused the Congress leader of launching an assault on India Inc on behalf of the investor.Taking to X, Malviya said, ""Isn’t it a coincidence that Rahul Gandhi and George Soros (Feb 16, 2023) are speaking the same language? It can’t be a mere coincidence that the Hindenburg report emerged just when Adani was raising 20,000 crore through a FPO in Feb 2023.""Malviya also posted an old video of George Soros in which he was accusing PM Modi and Adani of being ""close allies"" with intertwined fate.""Modi and business tycoon Adani are close allies. Their fate is intertwined. Adani Enterprises tried to raise funds in the stock market, but failed. Adani is accused of stock manipulation and his stock collapsed like a house of cards. Modi is silent on the subject, but he will have to answer questions from foreign investors and in parliament,"" Soros said in the video.Using the video, Malviya further questioned the timing of the US Justice Department's observation amid Donald Trump's impending presidency and Adani planning a US $600 million denominated bond offering.""And it can’t be a coincidence again that the US Justice Department’s observation comes, amidst US President-elect Donald Trump’s charge of the outgoing regime stacking/misusing the Department of Justice, and Adani planning a US $600 million denominated bond offering?"" Malviya said.""In both the instances, Congress and Rahul Gandhi led the charge, like subservient slaves of George Soros.

Half of them are out on bail and they are doing the work of judiciary!""The remarks came after Gandhi addressed the US prosecutors' allegations that Adani and associates paid $250 million in bribes to Indian officials. He said that the businessman had violated both Indian and American laws.Taking a jibe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi's poll rhetoric of 'ek hain, safe hain,' the leader of opposition in Lok Sabha said that PM Modi lacked the ""ability to arrest Adani"" as the whole ""BJP structure was funded by Adani.""Meanwhile, the Adani Group has rejected the charges made by US prosecutors.""The allegations made by the US Department of Justice and the US Securities and Exchange Commission against directors of Adani Green are baseless and denied,"" the conglomerate said in a statement, adding that ""all possible legal recourse will be sought,"" the statement read.The indictment accuses Adani and multiple subordinates of paying huge sums of more than $250 million in bribes to government officials for lucrative solar energy supply contracts.The deals were projected to generate more than $2 billion in profits after tax over roughly 20 years.""The Adani Group has always upheld and is steadfastly committed to maintaining the highest standards of governance, transparency and regulatory compliance across all jurisdictions of its operations,"" the statement added. ""We assure our stakeholders, partners and employees that we are a law-abiding organisation, fully compliant with all laws,"" it added.",BJP IT cell head Amit Malviya slammed Gandhi for speaking the same language as George Soros.

We will soon give a date for clause by clause discussion on its recommendations,"" Pal said after an almost six-hour meeting of the JPC, during which the minority affairs ministry presented a detailed justification for the proposed amendments proposed by the govt in the Waqf Act.Opposition MPs will meet LS Speaker Om Birla on Nov 25 the first day of the Parliament session , seeking an extension. They said they needed more time to raise questions and seek clarifications. Pal said the panel has engaged in an exhaustive deliberation with a gamut of stakeholders, and all members were given the opportunity to pose questions and seek replies, as he suggested that all that is left now is for the panel to discuss the report. ""I hope there will be a consensus,"" he said, a possibility highly unlikely due to opposition members' relentless objections to a host of the Bill's proposals.The proposed law is seen by them as a part of the BJP-led govt's political agenda. MPs from Congress, TMC, DMK, AAP and AIMIM have repeatedly questioned Pal's choice of stakeholders, and have even complained to Birlathe speaker over his alleged unilateral conduct and implementation of the govt's agenda. Pal has dismissed the charges, asserting that he has allowed every stakeholder and all opposition MPs to record their views.He said if opposition MPs want to meet Birla, it is their right. The speaker had constituted the committee, and whatever he decides will be acceptable to all, Pal added.The minority affairs ministry has deposed before the committee for nearly 29 hours over five days, and nearly 1,000 slides covering members' views and the ministry's replies and stand have been prepared, Pal said, rebutting the opposition's charge of inadequate deliberations.

"Eye on China, Rajnath Singh calls for talks to resolve global disputes",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/eye-on-china-rajnath-singh-calls-for-talks-to-resolve-global-disputes/articleshow/115544322.cms,"Rajnath Singh

NEW DELHI: China’s expansionist muscle-flexing and 'grey zone' tactics in the Indo-Pacific continue to figure prominently on the radar screens of the ' Quad ' and other countries, with defence minister Rajnath Singh once again stressing India firmly stands for freedom of navigation and overflight, unimpeded lawful commerce and adherence to international law for peace and prosperity in the region.Making this clear at the ongoing Asean defence ministers' meeting-plus (ADMM-Plus) at Vientiane on Thursday, a day after he told Chinese defence minister Admiral Dong Jun that de-escalation must now follow the recent troop disengagement in eastern Ladakh, Singh said open dialogue and peaceful negotiations were the only way forward in resolving complex international issues ranging from border disputes to trade agreements.It’s time Buddhist doctrines of peaceful co-existence were embraced more closely by all, as the world is increasingly getting polarised into blocks and camps, leading to increasing strain on the established world order, he said, with Dong and others listening.""The power of dialogue has always proven effective, yielding tangible results that contribute to stability and harmony on the global stage. India believes genuine long-term solutions to global problems can only be achieved when nations engage constructively, respecting each other’s perspectives and working toward shared goals in the spirit of cooperation,"" he added.The statement came in the backdrop of China’s continuing use of strong-arm tactics, below the threshold of a full-scale war, to push unreasonable territorial claims in the Indo-Pacific, be it the land borders with India or the South and East China Seas.While India does not want the Quad to acquire an overt military dimension, it has steadily enhanced defence cooperation and military interoperability with its members, the US, Australia and Japan, as well as with other like-minded countries, including those in the Asean.This found reflection in Singh’s bilateral meetings with his US, Australian and South Korean counterparts on the sidelines of the Asean meet on Thursday. Singh and Australian defence minister Pat Conroy announced an arrangement on air-to-air refuelling between their armed forces as part of their expanding military interoperability, while stressing their shared interests in ensuring ""stability and security"" in the Indian Ocean Region.Under the new pact, KC-30A multi-role tankers will provide mid-air refuelling to Indian military aircraft, including the P-8I long-range maritime patrol planes, to increase their operational ""reach and persistence"" in the Indo-Pacific. The two countries, incidentally, also just concluded their joint `AustraHind’ military exercise at Aundh, Pune.With US secretary of defence Lloyd J Austin, Singh discussed the “remarkable progress” made in bilateral defence-industrial cooperation, including the proposed co-production of GE-F414 jet engines for Tejas fighters, ground mobility systems like the Stryker armoured infantry combat vehicles and munitions, as well as “ongoing efforts to deepen the military partnership and interoperability to maintain a free and open Indo-Pacific”.The 'Quad' leaders’ summit in Washington on Sept 21 had declared that the four countries as “leading maritime democracies in the Indo-Pacific” would be a force for the good in the region, where “no country dominates and no country is dominated”, with an eye firmly on China.Singh emphasised the need for India and the US to work together on the agreed deliverables during the summit. These include the new regional maritime initiative for training in the Indo-Pacific (MAITRI), the first-ever Quad-at-sea ship observer mission, and the launch of a Quad Indo-Pacific logistics network pilot project to support civilian response to natural disasters more rapidly and efficiently across the Indo-Pacific region.","India firmly stands for freedom of navigation and overflight, unimpeded lawful commerce and adherence to international law in the region.

SC: Divert traffic via green land for metro work,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-divert-traffic-via-green-land-for-metro-work/articleshow/115542246.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Central Empowered Committee (CEC) of the Supreme Court recommended the use of 1.23 hectare in the forest and morphological ridge for the temporary diversion of traffic through two routes to facilitate the construction of Neb Sarai metro station .This station is being constructed for the new corridor from Aerocity to Tughlaqabad, known as Golden Line. The morphological ridge has ridge-like features and is given the same protection as the notified area. After CEC's nod, the project needs the final approval from the Supreme Court. Ridge Management Board approved the project in April. Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) said that due to the non-availability of wider alternate roads in the area, vehicular traffic and construction vehicles would have to pass through the construction zone of the proposed underground Neb Sarai metro station on Ignou main road. Due to the higher depth of the station - around 40m - huge machinery was mobilised at the construction site, leaving negligible space for the movement of traffic, it added.""To reduce the delay in the construction of the project, DMRC sought permission for the temporary diversion of traffic through two alternate routes involving Ridge Reserve Forest and Morphological Ridge Area to ease the traffic situation,"" said CEC.During a site visit in Sept, CEC travelled on both routes on foot. For the proposed route one, the committee suggested a shorter loop to reduce the requirement of forest land.CEC, in its report dated Nov 6, recommended the proposal of DMRC to the apex court, considering that the ""project is in public interest and the land being used for construction of the temporary routes is bare minimum required"". It also noted that the proposal was site-specific and the work of this metro station couldn't be completed without appropriate diversion of traffic.The committee asked DMRC to take necessary measures to prevent encroachment of ridge areas. CEC also directed DMRC to ensure that no tree is damaged or felled and return the ridge land in its original form after the construction.In the first route, the traffic coming from Ignou and moving towards Mehrauli-Badarpur Road or Saket metro, which is one-way traffic, will bypass the proposed Neb Sarai station by entering Freedom Fighter Enclave Gate no. 3 and connect with Westend Marg on the other side after passing through Delhi Tourism Area near Garden of Five Senses.The second route will bypass the proposed station by entering Freedom Fighter Enclave Gate no. 3 and pass through an open plot that is khasra numbers 96 and 97 near Subhash Chandra Bose Statue Park and further passing through Saidulajab Park, which will merge with the existing traffic at Westend Marg and meet Mehrauli-Badarpur Road.Two routes have been proposed as a backup in case of any emergency situations on one of them, such as the breakdown of a vehicle, movement of an ambulance, etc.","The Central Empowered Committee (CEC) of the Supreme Court recommended the use of 1.23 hectare in the forest and morphological ridge for the temporary diversion of traffic.

Kejriwal's colleague and AAP MLA Amanatullah Khan was the first to get a reprieve when a trial court last week did not take cognisance of the chargesheet against him as ED had not taken prior sanction from govt. Khan was granted bail by the court for the same reason.There are multiple money laundering cases against Chidambaram, some a decade old. Chargesheet against him in Aircel-Maxis case was filed in 2018, in which he has now approached higher courts seeking it to be dropped as he said sanction was not taken to prosecute him even though he was a public servant at that point. On Thursday, Delhi HC refused Kejriwal's plea on the same ground and asked ED to respond. A special court had taken cognisance of the chargesheet filed against Kejriwal in July.Framing of charges have been delayed against both Chidambaram and Kejriwal as they have repeatedly approached higher courts seeking to inspect 'unrelied upon documents' by the agency, and also challenged certain provisions of the PMLA , sources said.As reported by TOI on Thursday, ED is likely to approach SC seeking review of its judgment that has led to this confusion as the anti-money laundering investigations are always a result of registration of a predicate offence by some other agency, like economic offences wing of state police or CBI. Prosecution complaints (chargesheets) filed by ED are evidence of money laundering produced by the agency through details of financial transactions and other evidence.Sources said ambiguity in the SC judgment is whether ED needs to take fresh sanction under PMLA when the same has already been taken in the predicate offence registered by another agency, and chargesheets have been filed by them.The applicability of Section 197(1) of CrPC to ED cases, as mandated by the SC order, has been made through provisions of Section 65 of PMLA which states that CrPC will apply ""in so far as they are not inconsistent with the provisions of this Act"".","ED is making a list of all such accused who may be discharged in money laundering cases as a result of the SC order, if it is not reviewed.

Bishnoi, detained last week, has been lodged at the Pottawattamie County prison in Iowa, sources said.Known as 'Squirrel Cage Jail', the prison was referenced in an old radio programme called 'Gang Busters'. The prison facility's website had Anmol's details and mentioned his name as Anmol Bishnoi. It said he was being investigated by ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement), which deals with cross-border crime and undocumented immigration.While Anmol's arrest in the US seems triggered by information shared by the Indian govt about his illegal entry into the country, sources, however, suggested that he may have deliberately surrendered to US authorities as a tactical move to seek asylum. This development came after Mumbai police initiated extradition proceedings against him.Sources said before his detention, Anmol Bishnoi had applied for asylum through the US Citizenship and Immigration Services , a division of Department of Homeland Security. Now that he has initiated asylum proceedings through legal channels, it's unlikely that he will be extradited to India or any other country.The US legal system's tendency to grant bail in such cases, coupled with the precedent set by gangster Goldy Brar's release, raises the possibility that Anmol might evade extradition to India. Brar, too, has applied for asylum, sources said.Also, there is a possibility that Canada police may try to get access to him in connection with some gang-related cases being investigated by RCMP.FBI is learnt to be in the process of verifying Anmol's identity, possibly through a voice sample or a DNA match, sources said. The US agency officials, who had earlier this month confirmed his presence in America, are in touch with Indian agencies for subsequent processes, including his deportation.Anmol, who has a red notice issued against him by Interpol, is an accused in several high-profile cases, including the recent murder of former Maharashtra minister Baba Siddique and the firing incident outside Bollywood actor Salman Khan's residence in Mumbai.Anmol has also been accused of providing arms and logistical support to the shooters of Sidhu Moosewala who was killed on May 29, 2022.",Anmol Bishnoi is learnt to have applied for asylum in the US through his counsel.

Adani stocks today: Share prices of Adani Group companies crashed sharply by up to 20% on Thursday following charges against Gautam Adani and seven others in the United States regarding a multibillion-dollar bribery and fraud scheme. The US authorities revealed on Wednesday that the group allegedly bribed Indian officials for securing solar energy contracts. Adani shares are seeing their worst rout since the Hindenburg incident in early 2023.The flagship company Adani Enterprises witnessed a sharp decline of 20% in its share value, whilst Adani Energy Solutions experienced an identical drop.

Our main focus when assessing Adani Group is on the ability of the group's companies to access capital to meet their liquidity requirements and on its governance practices.""Meanwhile, GQG shares, a significant investor in Adani Group following the Hindenburg situation, experienced a 26% decline on the Australian exchange.On Wednesday, Adani disclosed a green energy investment.

Despite initial pricing, the bond offering was withdrawn following recent developments.In Asian trading sessions, Adani dollar bonds experienced significant declines, with Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone bonds dropping by 3-5 cents. These declines marked the steepest fall since the organisation faced short-seller allegations in February 2023.The US Securities and Exchange Commission has filed charges against Gautam Adani for allegedly ""defrauding American investors and bribing officials"".The charges extend to his nephew Sagar Adani, 30, Adani Green Energy executives, and Cyril Cabanes from Azure Power Global Ltd for ""conspiracy to commit securities and wire fraud, as well as substantive securities fraud, for their roles in a multi-billion-dollar scheme to obtain funds from US investors and global financial institutions through false and misleading statements"".According to the indictment, Adani and associates paid approximately $265 million in bribes, anticipating $2 billion in profits over twenty years.Prosecutors indicate that participants used code names such as ""Numero uno"" and ""the big man"" when referring to Gautam Adani.Court records reveal that arrest warrants have been issued for Gautam Adani and Sagar Adani, with prosecutors intending to forward these warrants to international law enforcement agencies.According to prosecutors, Gautam Adani, Sagar Adani, and former Adani Green Energy CEO Vneet Jaain secured loans and bonds exceeding $3 billion by concealing fraudulent activities from their financial partners and investors.The charges against Gautam Adani, Sagar Adani, and Jaain include securities fraud, securities fraud conspiracy, and wire fraud conspiracy.

Counting of votes for both states will take place on Nov 23.The list of polls compiled by TOI from news media and posts on X from their official handles showed that six of the 10 exit polls in Maharashtra gave a clear advantage to the NDA (Mahayuti), one predicted a near-equal show while the remaining three gave the opposition INDIA bloc ( Maha Vikas Aghadi ) the edge.In Jharkhand, three of the seven polls gave a clear edge to opposition NDA in the 81-member House, one indicated a close fight, and two gave INDIA majority. One poll gave neither alliance a majority.Among the polls in Maharashtra that put NDA ahead, the maximum number of seats for the combine in the 288-member assembly varied by around 40 seats - from 157 as predicted by P-Marq to 195 by Peoples Pulse. 'Poll Diary', that predicted a maximum of 186 seats for NDA, kept the range at 122-86 - a margin of 64 seats. The same pollster predicted 69-121 seats for INDIA bloc, again a margin of 53 seats.Polls that gave an edge to NDA suggest most seats will be divided between the two alliances, with other parties reduced to single-digit tallies.Polls that predicted either an equal battle or gave the advantage to INDIA gave a higher number of seats to other parties. Dainik Bhaskar, Electoral Edge and SAS predicted an advantage to INDIA, with Electoral Edge giving the fewest seats to NDA, at 118.In Jharkhand too, most exit polls predict an advantage for NDA. Three of the seven polls have given a clear edge to the saffron combine while Times Now- JVC indicates NDA might have an advantage but the INDIA alliance is very close to the majority mark of 41 seats.Dainik Bhaskar has not given clear majority to either alliance, indicating a neck-and-neck contest. Two pollsters have given a majority to the INDIA alliance.",Most TV channels refrained from commissioning exit polls for the Maharashtra and Jharkhand assembly elections. Exit polls released Wednesday evening after close of polling in Maharashtra and the second phase in Jharkshand hinted at an advantage for NDA in both states.

What to Expect: High-Spending Strategies

NEW DELHI: The IPL 2025 mega auction , scheduled for November 24-25 in Jeddah, promises to be a high-stakes event. With teams revealing their retention strategies and budgets, it’s clear that some franchises are primed to dominate the bidding wars.The auction purse distribution, retention choices, and strategic use of Right to Match (RTM) cards will determine who can spend big and who needs to tread carefully.Punjab Kings are the undisputed leaders in financial flexibility, boasting a massive INR 110.5 crore, the largest auction purse by far.Their minimalist retention strategy—keeping just two uncapped players, Shashank Singh and Prabhsimran Singh—ensures they can aggressively pursue marquee players, including potential game-changers like Jos Buttler and Rishabh Pant, both of whom are back in the auction pool.Punjab also hold four RTM cards, giving them a significant edge in retaining high-value targets during the auction.With no pre-existing financial constraints, Punjab have the freedom to outbid rivals for top-tier domestic and international players, making them the team to watch.Delhi Capitals enter the auction with a strong purse of INR 73 crore, thanks to a balanced retention strategy. By retaining core players like Axar Patel and Kuldeep Yadav, Delhi have enough room to focus on filling critical gaps, particularly in their batting lineup.With two RTMs at their disposal, they can strategically secure key players without overspending.Similarly, Royal Challengers Bengaluru (INR 83 crore) hold the second-largest purse, giving them ample room to manoeuvre.Their decision to retain just three players—Virat Kohli, Rajat Patidar, and Yash Dayal—signals a complete overhaul, allowing RCB to rebuild around fresh talent.With three RTM cards, RCB have flexibility to ensure they secure value for money.Both Lucknow Super Giants and Gujarat Titans have INR 69 crore each, making them well-positioned to make a significant impact.While Lucknow retained five players, including the dynamic Nicholas Pooran and emerging star Ayush Badoni, Gujarat focused on retaining consistent performers like Shubman Gill and Rashid Khan.Both teams have retained a strong core, giving them the flexibility to bid strategically for international stars or emerging domestic talents.Limited Spending Power: Rajasthan Royals and Kolkata Knight RidersRajasthan Royals enter the auction with the smallest purse, INR 41 crore, having retained six players, including big names like Sanju Samson and Yashasvi Jaiswal.With no RTM cards, Rajasthan’s strategy will revolve around precise acquisitions that deliver maximum value.They will likely focus on securing budget-friendly uncapped players and filling specific gaps in their bowling attack.Kolkata Knight Riders, with INR 51 crore, face a similar situation. While retaining stars like Andre Russell and Rinku Singh, they have no RTMs, limiting their ability to revisit past performers. KKR will need to prioritize efficiency in their bidding strategy.Teams like Punjab, Delhi, and RCB are set to dominate the bidding wars, while Rajasthan and Kolkata must operate cautiously.Punjab’s aggressive financial advantage may force competitors to overspend, driving up prices for marquee players. The strategic use of RTMs by franchises like Delhi and RCB will also be intriguing for the fans.Ultimately, the IPL 2025 mega auction is a battleground of budgets, and the winners will be those who balance star power with squad depth.","Teams like Punjab, Delhi, and RCB are set to dominate the bidding wars.

HALIFAX: Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau 's government announced plans Thursday to temporarily lift the federal sales tax off a number of items and send checks to millions of Canadians who are dealing with rising costs and as a federal election looms.The measures come as a cost of living crisis has left voters unhappy with Trudeau and ahead of an election that could come anytime between this fall and next October.""Our government can't set prices at the checkout, but we can put more money in people's pockets,"" Trudeau said at a news conference in Toronto.Under the plan, Canadians who worked in 2023 and earned up to 150,000 Canadian dollars ($ 107,440) will receive a check for 250 Canadian dollars. Trudeau noted that even those earning at the high end of that amount have been struggling to get by.An estimated 18.7 million Canadians will receive the one-time check.The federal goods and services tax break would begin Dec. 14 and end Feb. 15.The government said the tax break will apply to a number of items including children's clothing and shoes, toys, diapers, restaurant meals, beer and wine. It also applies to Christmas trees, a variety of snack foods and beverages and video game consoles.Opposition Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre called the announcement a ""two month temporary tax trick"" that won't make up for carbon taxes that are set to go up.Trudeau has said he will lead his Liberal Party into the next election, which could come anytime up to next October.

UJJAIN: Madhya Pradesh chief minister Mohan Yadav on Thursday performed ‘ bhoomi pujan ’ of the state's first 'medicity' in Ujjain. The proposed medicity will come on 14.97 acre land and will be built at an estimated cost of Rs 592.30 crore.

This ambitious project is targeted to be completed before 2028 Simhastha Kumbh in Ujjain, during which about 15 crore people are expected to visit the city.Even in normal times, some 5-7 crore people visit Ujjain annually. The medicity will be hugely helpful,"" Yadav said.A medical device park is also being developed, with 950 acres of land in Vikram Udyogpuri being utilised, and an additional 950 acres being acquired. Major industrialists and investors are coming, and this trend will continue, he said, adding that efforts are being made to provide maximum facilities in minimal space.If more land is needed for the medical city in the future, it is available, he said. He noted that from 1956 to the present, only six medical colleges, including Raipur, were established in the state, but under the BJP's ideology, 17 govt medical colleges have been established, along with 13 private ones. Twelve medical colleges are coming up under the PPP model with plans to increase this to 10,000 in the coming years. Five Ayurvedic colleges will start this session, with seven more in the next session.He also mentioned the growth of medical tourism in the state, with people from abroad coming to places like Indore for treatment.

Domestic banks may also find it difficult to advance fresh loans to projects where the directors are under investigation.The Adani group has a total debt of Rs 2.4 lakh crore, against which it has a cash balance of Rs 59,791 crore, resulting in net debt of Rs 1,81,604 crore. The cash balances are 24.77% of gross debt, providing it with enough liquidity cover to support 30 months of debt repayment . Lenders, therefore, do not foresee any immediate risk to loan repayments.Of the total gross debt, Rs 88,100 crore (36% of the exposure) is with domestic banks and institutions. The bulk of these domestic advances (Rs 75,877 crore) are term loans, while Rs 12,233 crore has been raised by way of working capital.Public sector banks have a 15% share of the total debt, while private banks have a 4% share. The largest domestic chunk - 18% of total debt - is held by public sector financial institutions and non-bank finance companies lending to the power and infrastructure segment.While global banks account for 26% of total debt, international capital markets by way of bonds are the largest creditors to the group at 29%. Domestic capital markets' share stood at 5% of total debt.Shares of Power Finance Corporation and Life Insurance Corporation, which have significant exposure to the Adani group, were down 3.5% and 1.6%, respectively.Institutions with large debt exposure to the Adani group include LIC, SBI, Power Finance Corporation, and Rural Electrification Corporation.The group, in an investor presentation after the first quarter, said that while its gross debt rose consistently from Rs 2.27 lakh crore in FY23 to Rs 2.41 lakh crore in FY24, the net debt has shrunk from Rs 1.87 lakh crore to Rs 1.81 lakh crore in FY24 due to improvements in cash balances. This followed a jump in earnings coupled with equity mobilisation by the group.","The Adani group has a total debt of Rs 2.4 lakh crore, against which it has a cash balance of Rs 59,791 crore. The cash balances are 24.77% of gross debt, providing it with enough liquidity cover to support 30 months of debt repayment. Lenders do not foresee any immediate risk to loan repayments.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115548638,imgsize-520138,width-400,resizemode-4/115548638.jpg"

Anti-incumbency risk for congress govt

BENGALURU: Karnataka faces a severe financial setback as prolonged delays in elections for zilla panchayats (ZPs), taluk panchayats (TPs), and urban local bodies (ULBs), including the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike , jeopardize its eligibility for central grants. The state has just 16 months to complete these polls or risk losing a huge share of Rs 18,948 crore allocated by the 15th Finance Commission for 2021-26.Of the total grant, Rs 12,539 crore is earmarked for rural local bodies (RLBs) and Rs 6,409 crore for ULBs, distributed in a 65:35 ratio. However, the Union finance ministry has withheld Rs 2,842 crore, or 15% of the 2023-24 allocation, citing delays in local body elections. While gram panchayats, which remain functional, have received their share, funds for zilla panchayats, taluk panchayats, and BBMP are frozen as these councils ceased to exist after their tenures expired.The elections for BBMP, pending since Sept 2021, and for ZPs and TPs, overdue since May 2022, remain stalled. Meanwhile, polls for Shivamogga Mahanagara Palike and Mysuru City Corporation were only completed in Nov 2023, and Tumkur and Davanagere city corporations face deadlines in Jan 2024 and Feb 2025, respectively.""We could not claim funds for ZPs and TPs since these local bodies don't exist after their councils' tenure expired. Efforts are under way to facilitate elections, and we are committed to ensuring the polls at the earliest,"" said Priyank Kharge, rural development and panchayat raj minister. The 5th State Finance Commission (SFC), headed by former Lok Sabha member C Narayanaswamy, issued a stark warning to the state govt about lapsing funds in its first report. The SFC is preparing a second report for the 2025-26 financial year, expected in Dec, to reinforce the urgency of conducting polls.""The only way to avail this fund is to ensure pending polls for the local bodies before March 2026. I hope things will fall in place,"" Narayanaswamy said.For Congress govt, the ZP-TP elections pose significant political risks. Widely regarded as the semi-finals of assembly elections, these cover all districts and could amplify antiincumbency sentiments amid allegations of corruption. BJP, already preparing a strong fight in BBMP elections, is expected to heighten its challenge statewide.On the legal front, the Karnataka State Election Commission (SEC) has filed a contempt petition in the high court against the state govt for failing to notify reservations for ZP-TP constituencies following delimitation. The high court is scheduled to hear the case on Nov 27, while the Supreme Court will address a petition demanding early BBMP elections on Nov 25.“As we have filed a contempt petition against the govt related to ZP-TP polls, we are going to request the high court to pass an urgent order. We’re hopeful of a favourable ruling and are well prepared to conduct the elections at the earliest,” said state election commissioner GS Sangresh.Congress govt, often critical of the BJP-led Union govt for allegedly withholding state’s rightful share of funds, is under immense pressure to expedite these elections. The outcome of the upcoming legal hearings and the govt’s actions will be critical in determining whether Karnataka secures its share of 15th Finance Commission grants.","Karnataka faces a severe financial setback as prolonged delays in elections jeopardize its eligibility for central grants.

JAIPUR: Pungent garlic has gone missing from curries and kitchens in the state as prices for the spice zoomed this month, ranging from Rs 400 to Rs 600 per kg in the retail market.Prolonged monsoon, heavy rains and moisture have damaged the crop in the prime growing areas of Kota, Baran, Bundi and Jodhpur, taking production down. After Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan is the largest producer of garlic.""In the wholesale market, we buy garlic in the Rs 250-350/kg range. It's sold at Rs 400-600 in the retail market. Heavy moisture that lasted till mid-Oct has damaged the crop this year,"" said Shiv Shankar Sharma, a wholesale trader at Muhana Mandi, pointing to the shortage in supply.""The supply is almost 40% of what we usually get. The rising trend will continue. However, when we start getting garlic from other states in a week, there will be a minor dip in prices,"" said Mohammed Qasim, a wholesale dealer of onions, ginger and garlic at the mandi.In Sept, garlic was being sold at Rs 120-160/kg, which rose to Rs 160-240 in Oct.""Now the prices are between Rs 400 to 600, depending on the size. While small garlic is available at Rs 400/kg, and the larger ones at Rs 600,"" said Kishan Samtani, another wholesale dealer. Most traders expect a good crop in Feb.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.
