Afghanistan 's economy continues to face challenges three years after the Taliban 's insurgency ended, despite security improvements. The United Nations reports that a significant portion of the population relies on minimal sustenance, and widespread unemployment persists.The World Bank cautions that economic growth may stagnate in the coming years.Nevertheless, the Taliban government has made some progress since taking control in 2021, although it lacks international recognition.The Afghan currency has remained stable, corruption has decreased, and tax collection has improved.The government has also established economic, trade, and investment ties in the region, according to Ahmad Zahid, the deputy commerce and industry minister.Afghanistan possesses significant potential in minerals and agriculture, but developing these sectors is hindered by inadequate infrastructure, expertise, and investment.Azizullah Rehmati, a businessman in Herat, is thriving despite the challenges. His saffron company is poised for growth, and the improved security has eliminated the need for armed guards. However, he faces difficulties due to the crippled banking sector and the closure of embassies, which complicate international transactions and travel.In contrast, Wahid Nekzai Logari, a former musician in Afghanistan's national orchestra, has been left jobless due to the Taliban's ban on public music performances. He occasionally works as a taxi driver to support his family but earns significantly less than he did as a musician, reports AFP.Abdul Wali Shaheen, a former Taliban fighter, now works at the Department of Information and Culture in Ghazni province. Although his new job is more stressful, his salary is sufficient to support his family, and he is optimistic about the country's progress under the Taliban.Sayeda, a beautician in Kabul, secretly reopened her salon after beauty salons were ordered to close. Despite the risks of being discovered by the authorities, she continues to operate to provide an income for herself and her employees, albeit with a reduced customer base and salary.","Afghanistan's economy continues to face challenges three years after the Taliban's insurgency ended.

"‘Burst of rainfall’ caused by human-induced climate change to blame for Wayanad landslides, say researchers",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/140-mm-of-rain-lashed-wayanad-in-a-single-day-study/articleshow/112507580.cms,"NEW DELHI: A scientific study has attributed the July 30 devastating Wayanad landslides to a “burst of rainfall” triggered by human-induced climate change . It said more than 140 mm of rains fell in a single day - equivalent to nearly a quarter of London's annual rainfall - on soils that were already highly saturated following two months of seasonal monsoon rains in Kerala.A group of 24 researchers from India, US, UK, Sweden, Netherlands and Malaysia, who conducted the study, noted that though such an extreme event is expected to occur on average about “once every 50 years” under the current global warming of 1.2 degree celsius, people in northern Kerala can be saved from future landslides and floods only with “minimising deforestation and quarrying, while improving early warning and evacuation systems”.The study under the World Weather Attribution (WWA) shows that the event was the third heaviest one-day rainfall episode on record in the region, with heaviest spells in 2019 and 1924, where the climate change made the downpours 10% heavier, triggering the deadly landslides.“The Wayanad landslides is another catastrophic example of climate change playing out in real-time... Until the world replaces fossil fuels with renewable energy, monsoon downpours will continue to intensify, bringing landslides, floods and misery to India,” said Mariam Zachariah, researcher at the Grantham Institute - Climate Change and the Environment, Imperial College London.On prior alerts issue that put the Centre and the Kerala govt at loggerhead, the study underlined that though the extreme rainfall was well forecast by the IMD and warnings were issued, the information was at the state-level, making it difficult to discern which localities would be impacted by landslides (one of the potential impacts of heavy rainfall listed in the warning) and would therefore require evacuation.“The findings reported here are physically consistent with those predicted by climate science... These direct threats to people in India will continue to escalate as the climate warms and humans continue to regulate natural systems,” said Arpita Mondal, associate professor, IIT Bombay.The WWA study, released on Wednesday, flagged that if the world does not move away from fossil fuels, causing global warming to reach 2 degree Celsius, one-day spells of rainfall in Kerala will become a further 4% heavier, risking even more destructive landslides.WWA is an international collaboration that analyses and communicates the possible influence of climate change on extreme weather events, such as storms, extreme rainfall, heatwaves, and droughts.",A scientific study has attributed the July 30 devastating Wayanad landslides to a “burst of rainfall” triggered by human-induced climate change.

High costs may derail plan for aluminum Vande Bharat coaches,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/high-costs-may-derail-plan-for-aluminum-vande-bharat-coaches/articleshow/112505721.cms,"NEW DELHI: Railways may not go for aluminum-bodied Vande Bharat trains with sleeper facility because of high cost and considering that no Indian company has the knowhow. It's instead planning to manufacture 24-coach sleeper version of these modern trains that can travel at higher speeds.Sources said besides high cost, manufacture of these trains with aluminium coaches requires import of foreign technology.They added that focus is on bringing down prices and use of indigenous technologies.Last year, railways had cancelled its Rs 30,000 crore tender for procuring 100 Vande Bharat trains with aluminium coaches after it found the cost quoted by lowest bidder Alstom India was high. Sources said the French rolling stock company had quoted Rs 150.9 crore per trainset, but railways' tender panel had recommended that the price shouldn't be more than Rs 140 crore. They said Alstom India had intended to close the deal for approximately Rs 145 crore per trainset. But no agreement could be reached and the tender was cancelled. Prior to this, railways had bid out a contract to manufacture 200 Vande Bharat sleeper trainsets at Rs 120 crore per rake.Aluminum-bodied trainsets were chosen by railways and it had floated a tender last year since these are lower in weight and more energy efficient than standard stainless steel. Till now the national transporter has awarded contracts to procure 102 Vande Bharat with chair cars and another 200 with sleeper facility.An Alstom spokesperson said the company's offer for 100 aluminium trains was a very competitive offer, and the lowest when benchmarked against similar trains produced globally.",Railways may not go for aluminum-bodied Vande Bharat trains with sleeper facility because of high cost.

Lakhs of people in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh braced for potential flooding after the 19th crest gate of the 71-year-old dam across the Tungabhadra river failed Sunday afternoon. The dam, about 350km from Bengaluru, saw water gushing out after the gate gave way, putting downstream districts in north Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh’s Kurnool and Nandyal on high alert.The Tungabhadra dam , inaugurated in 1953 with a maximum storage capacity of 133TMCFT (thousand million cubic feet), had 100TMCFT of water as of Saturday, with the remaining 33TMCFT being silt.Of the 33 crest gates at the dam, 22 were opened Saturday evening, releasing nearly 1 lakh cusecs of water into the river.However, the damaged gate has raised concerns, as engineers estimate that 60TMCFT of the stored water must be drained before they can replace the damaged gate. The process, along with constructing a new gate, could take up to four days or longer.Districts downstream of the dam, including those in AP, have been put on high alert. Karnataka deputy CM DK Shivakumar visited the site to assess the situation. “On Saturday night, 40,000 cusecs of water was being released into the Tungabhadra river through 10 crest gates. At 12.50am, the 19th gate malfunctioned, causing a huge flow of water into the river. We’ve taken every possible precaution,” he said.Tungabhadra Board secretary ORK Reddy assured there was no immediate cause for concern, noting that the dam’s design allows for the release of up to 6.5 lakh cusecs of water at once, though the maximum release recorded so far was 3.6 lakh cusecs in Dec 1992.AP govt placed officials in Kurnool and Nandyal districts on alert. Kurnool city is on the banks of the Tungabhadra. CM N Chandrababu Naidu directed senior officials from the water resources department to assess the situation and dispatched a team of senior engineers to assist at the dam site.Union minister HD Kumaraswamy emphasised the need for safety upgrades to ageing structures like Krishna Raja Sagar reservoir, suggesting the installation of gates similar to those at the Narayanapura and Almatti dams.","19th crest gate of the 71-year-old dam across the Tungabhadra river failed Sunday afternoon.

"Eye on China & Pakistan, India fast-tracks deal for 31 US 'hunter-killer' drones",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/eye-on-china-pakistan-india-fast-tracks-deal-for-31-us-hunter-killer-drones/articleshow/112505123.cms,"NEW DELHI: With both China and Pakistan bolstering their fleets of armed drones , India is fast-tracking negotiations for the acquisition of 31 weaponised MQ-9B `hunter-killer’ remotely-piloted aircraft from the US, with the somewhat ambitious aim to ink the mega deal by November-December this year.Techno-commercial discussions for the inter-governmental contract for the 31 armed high-altitude, long endurance drones “are in an advanced stage now”, with 15 Sea Guardians earmarked for Navy and 8 Sky Guardians each for Army and IAF, defence ministry sources told TOI.This comes at a time when China, which continues the military confrontation in eastern Ladakh for the fifth year running now, has stepped-up supplies of its armed Cai Hong-4 and Wing Loong-II drones to Pakistan. “Pakistan has sought 16 more armed CH-4 drones from China. It already has seven CH-4 drones in the Army and 3 in Navy,” a source said.The MQ-9B Reaper or Predator-B drones, designed to fly for around 40 hours at altitudes over 40,000-feet for surveillance and armed with Hellfire air-to-ground missiles and smart bombs for precision strikes, are considered far superior to Chinese armed drones.The operational utility of the MQ-9B drones has been reinforced by extensive ISR (intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance) missions being undertaken by the two unarmed Sea Guardian drones -- taken on lease from US firm General Atomics -- both over the vast Indian Ocean Region (IOR) as well as along the 3,488-km Line of Actual Control with China.While the US has put a price tag of $3.9 billion (over Rs 33,500 crore) for the 31 weaponised MQ-9B drones and associated equipment, including 170 Hellfire missiles, 310 GBU-39B precision-guided glide bombs, navigation systems, sensor suites and mobile ground control systems, the Indian negotiating team is working to bring the costs down.“The price and terms offered by the US govt and General Atomics to other countries is being taken into account. All efforts are underway to conclude the deal within this calendar year after the final nod from the cabinet committee on security,” a source said.Under the deal, the drones will be assembled in India, while General Atomics will also source some components from Indian companies as well as set up a global MRO (maintenance, repair, overhaul) facility here.“Since General Atomics cannot give transfer of technology for the varied sub-systems it sources from other companies, it will provide expertise and consultancy to DRDO and other entities to develop such advanced drones indigenously,” the source said.The armed forces hope to induct the first 10 MQ-9B drones within a couple of years of the contract being inked, though it will depend on General Atomics’ production capacity. The rest will come in batches every six months.The plan is to deploy the fighter-size drones at ISR command and control centres at Arakkonam and Porbandar for the Indian Ocean region and Sarsawa and Gorakhpur for the land borders. “With their long-distance hunting and killing capabilities, such drones are required at a time when China’s naval forays into the IOR are only going to increase further,” an officer said.","The MQ-9B Reaper or Predator-B drones are designed to fly for around 40 hours at altitudes over 40,000-feet for surveillance and armed with Hellfire air-to- ground missiles and smart bombs for precision strikes.

"Bail rule, jail exception even in special law like UAPA: Supreme Court",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bail-rule-jail-exception-even-in-special-law-like-uapa-supreme-court/articleshow/112504869.cms,"Times View It is an established judicial view that bail should be the norm and jail the exception. By clarifying that this principle applies not just in cases of routine crime but even where the charges are under special laws like UAPA, the apex court has made an important ruling.

NEW DELHI: In an important ruling, Supreme Court Tuesday held that the conventional idea ‘ bail is the rule , jail is an exception ’ should be applicable not only to IPC offences but also to others for which special statutes like Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act have been enacted if the conditions prescribed under that law are fulfilled.While granting bail to a former constable of Bihar Police who was charged under the stringent UAPA because of his alleged association with the outlawed Islamist outfit Popular Front of India (PFI), a bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Augustine George Masih emphasised that courts should not hesitate in granting bail in serious offences if a case is made out for bail.Recently, the apex court, through its various verdicts, had diluted stringent provisions for bail under special laws, like it did in the Manish Sisodia case when it held that delay in trial and long incarceration could be grounds for bail despite the tough triple test in the anti-laundering act PMLA.Interestingly, just six months ago on Feb 9, another SC bench had held that ‘bail is the rule, jail is an exception’ was not applicable when an accused was facing charges under anti-terror law UAPA and, also, held that delayed trial proceedings in grave offences could not be a ground to seek bail.In the case on Tuesday, the court noted that the accused had been in custody for more than two years and the trial had not commenced. It said the trial court and Patna high court erred in rejecting his bail plea as they did not objectively analyse the evidence and their main focus was on the activities of PFI which the accused was alleged to be associated with.“When a case is made out for grant of bail, courts should not have any hesitation in granting bail. The allegations of the prosecution may be very serious. But the duty of courts is to consider the case for grant of bail in accordance with the law. ‘Bail is the rule and jail is an exception’ is a settled law. Even in a case like the present case where there are stringent conditions for the grant of bail in the relevant statutes, the same rule holds good with the only modification that bail can be granted if the conditions in the statute are satisfied. The rule also means that once a case is made out for grant of bail, the court cannot decline to grant bail. If courts start denying bail in deserving cases, it will be a violation of the rights guaranteed under Article 21 of our Constitution,” the bench said.On Feb 9, the court had ruled to the contrary. “The conventional idea in bail jurisprudence vis-a-vis ordinary penal offences that the discretion of courts must tilt in favour of the oft-quoted phrase ‘bail is the rule, jail is the exception’, unless circumstances justify otherwise, does not find any place while dealing with bail applications under UAPA. The ‘exercise’ of the general power to grant bail under UAPA is severely restrictive in scope. The form of the words used in proviso to Section 43D (5) — ‘shall not be released’ — in contrast with the form of the words as found in Section 437(1) CrPC — ‘may be released’ — suggests the intention of the legislature to make bail the exception and jail the rule,” the court had said.In the Patna case, the prosecution alleged that the accused was associated with PFI and he let out one floor of his house to members of the outfit to carry out illegal activities. It was also alleged that he was part of the meeting where PFI members discussed plans to kill BJP’s Nupur Sharma for her statements on Prophet Mohammed. But the court said the evidence and statements of witnesses falsified the allegation that he was present in the meeting.The court said there was nothing in the chargesheet which showed that the accused had taken part or had committed unlawful activities as defined in UAPA and no specific material was there to show that he advocated, abetted or incited commission of any unlawful activities.Analysing the evidence and statements of witnesses threadbare, the bench said on plain reading of the chargesheet, it was not possible to record a conclusion that there were reasonable grounds for believing that the charges against the accused of commission of offences punishable under UAPA were prima facie true.“There is not even an allegation in the chargesheet that the appellant was a member of any terrorist gang. As regards the second part of being a member of a terrorist organisation, as per Section 2(m), a terrorist organisation means an organisation listed in the first schedule or an organisation operating under the same name as the organisation was listed. The chargesheet does not mention the name of the terrorist organisation within the meaning of Section 2(m) of which the appellant was a member. We find that PFI is not a terrorist organisation, as is evident from the first schedule,” it said. PFI and its affiliates were termed “unlawful association” under UAPA and banned by govt in Sept 2022. The first schedule of UAPA lists terrorist organisations.","It is an established judicial view that bail should be the norm and jail the exception. By clarifying that this principle applies not just in cases of routine crime but even where the charges are under special laws like UAPA, the apex court has made an important ruling.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112504868,imgsize-34684,width-400,resizemode-4/112504868.jpg"
EC to talk to home secretary on Jammu & Kashmir security today,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ec-to-talk-to-home-secretary-on-jammu-kashmir-security-today/articleshow/112504795.cms,"TOI

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission will hold consultations with the Union home secretary Wednesday to assess the security situation in Jammu and Kashmir ahead of scheduling assembly polls in the Union Territory, besides discussing the possible challenges and concerns as well as availability of security forces .Some key concerns likely to come up during the deliberations between EC — represented by CEC Rajiv Kumar and election commissioners Gyanesh Kumar and S S Sandhu — and Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla include arranging the force logistics to secure the candidates, campaign meetings and electors, particularly as the recent uptick in terrorist activities in Jammu region has led to redeployment of forces to secure the mountain tops and counter the foreign terrorists hiding there.Even Kashmir districts like Kulgam and Anantnag have seen attacks on security personnel of late, and counter-terror operations are underway to trace and neutralise the perpetrators.EC sources toldthat the requirement of security forces for poll deployment is assessed as “very high” as their stepped-up presence is crucial to creating a conducive security atmosphere for campaigning and polling. More than 16,000 personnel will be needed to extend security to an average 15 candidates in each of J&K’s 90 assembly constituencies.“Democracy is to be strengthened layer by layer... increasing voting percentage is just one layer, the others being facilitating participation by a large number of candidates, more poll rallies and meetings and the wider use of IT applications like CVigil etc. EC is committed to holding the polls in J&K with all the layers strengthened,” CEC Rajiv Kumar toldSome other factors to be considered by EC are climatic conditions in J&K, apple harvesting season, and expected seasonal migration of nomadic tribes like Gujjars and Bakarwals from the higher reaches to lower ground, over Sept and Oct.The EC had indicated its intent to hold J&K polls within the Sept 30 deadline set by the Supreme Court by announcing the special summary revision of electoral rolls in J&K and other poll-bound states in June. An EC team visited J&K last week to assess poll preparedness and has now set up the customary meeting with MHA to discuss the security arrangements.A source said the publication of revised J&K electoral roll with July 1, 2024 as reference date, on Aug 20 and the conclusion of Amarnath Yatra on Aug 19, shall pave the way for EC to announce polls any day after Aug 20.Sources in the J&K security establishment said that while there are concerns about the surge in terror strikes in Jammu, “the fact remains that most of these attacks were the handiwork of foreign terrorists and targeted at security forces”. “The threat to J&K elections may, on the other hand, emanate from local terrorists and sleeper modules and target candidates and other civilians. J&K Police have largely controlled the situation in the flat areas of Kashmir and even Jammu, though the hilly regions remain a challenge. Terrorists may still carry out surprise attacks, but J&K Police are fully prepared for conduct of assembly polls as and when the EC directs,” a senior police officer told","The Election Commission will hold consultations with the Union home secretary Wednesday to assess the security situation in Jammu and Kashmir.

Bangladesh: Dozens Of Hasina's Party Members Chased & Killed In Mob Attacks; 29 Bodies Found

Heavy rains in Brazil have led to a remarkable paleontological discovery : a 233 million-year-old dinosaur fossil . This significant find was made in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul , near the town of São João do Polêsine. The fossil, which is almost fully preserved, was unearthed next to a reservoir after torrential rains eroded parts of the fossil site.The dinosaur, believed to be a member of the Herrerasauridae family , roamed the Earth during the Triassic Period when all the continents were part of a single landmass known as Pangea.Herrerasaurids were among the earliest carnivorous dinosaurs, and this particular specimen is estimated to have been about 2.5 meters (8 feet) long. The discovery was made by a team led by Rodrigo Temp Müller , a paleontologist from the Federal University of Santa Maria (UFSM).The site where the fossil was found has been a focus of paleontological research for about 20 years. The region is known for its rich deposits of Triassic fossils, which have provided valuable insights into the early evolution of dinosaurs . The recent heavy rains accelerated the erosion process, exposing the fossil that had been buried for millions of years. According to Müller, the fossil was initially thought to be just a few isolated bones, but further excavation revealed an almost complete skeleton.This discovery is particularly significant because it is one of the oldest dinosaur fossils ever found. The oldest known dinosaur fossils date back to around 231 million years ago, making this find potentially one of the earliest examples of dinosaur evolution. The fossil’s excellent preservation allows scientists to study its anatomical details, which could provide new insights into the characteristics and behaviors of early dinosaurs.The Herrerasauridae family, to which this dinosaur belongs, includes some of the first known carnivorous dinosaurs. These dinosaurs were bipedal, much like the Tyrannosaurus Rex, meaning they walked on two legs, and had free hands with sharp claws for catching prey. The newly discovered fossil is expected to shed light on the evolutionary adaptations that allowed these early dinosaurs to thrive in their environment.The discovery has generated excitement in the scientific community, as it could help fill gaps in our understanding of dinosaur evolution. The fossil’s age and preservation make it a unique and valuable addition to the fossil record, offering a rare glimpse into the distant past. Researchers are now working to carefully extract the fossil from the surrounding rock and conduct detailed analyses to determine whether it represents a new species of dinosaur.The region where the fossil was found has been subject to increasingly severe weather events, including the heavy rains that led to this discovery. In June 2024, the state of Rio Grande do Sul experienced three months’ worth of rain within just two weeks, causing widespread flooding and displacing over 500,000 people. While the rains have accelerated the erosion process, they also pose a threat to newly exposed fossils, which can be damaged or destroyed if not promptly rescued.The Federal University of Santa Maria and other research institutions are now focused on preserving the fossil and conducting further studies. The findings from this discovery are expected to be published in scientific journals, contributing to our knowledge of early dinosaur evolution and the conditions that shaped their development.For the unversed, dinosaurs were a diverse group of reptiles that dominated the Earth during the Mesozoic Era, which lasted from about 252 to 66 million years ago. They were some of the most successful and varied animals ever to have lived, ranging from the small, bird-like Velociraptor to the gigantic, long-necked Brachiosaurus.Did you like this article?

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive.

During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%.

Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
'No tax on tips': Trump and Harris find common ground as a populist stance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/no-tax-on-tips-trump-and-harris-find-common-ground-as-a-populist-stance/articleshow/112509670.cms,"What is tips on tax?

Who stands to gain?

How will it impact?

In the fiercely contested US presidential campaign, an unexpected point of agreement has surfaced between Trump and Harris, the belief that workers' tips should not be taxed.While the move is seen as a populist, it has drawn criticism for being economically irresponsible.Trump introduced his proposal during a rally in June. Harris, his Democratic opponent, voiced her support for the idea this weekend, prompting the Trump campaign to dub her ""copy cat Kamala.""Both candidates disclosed their proposals in Nevada, a critical battleground state with the highest proportion of waiting staff in the country, according to the US Labor Department.In the United States, tipping culture is unique, with customers expected to tip generously for services ranging from take-out coffee to cocktails.A typical tip is between 15 and 20 percent of the bill at restaurants. Some states still allow employers to pay tipped workers as little as $2.13 per hour, provided their tips bring their earnings up to the federal minimum wage of $7.25.Given the major portion ofservice-sector wages that come from tips, the proposal to eliminate taxes on tips has wide appeal, although it is not favored by many economists and think tanks.""There's no particular reason that, in general, people in the service industry should pay lower taxes than somebody on the factory line or somebody that's providing nursing care,"" Marc Goldwein, senior vice president of the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB), told AFP.""This creates an equity issue where two people doing similar work that the market has deemed is worth the same amount of money pay different levels of taxes. That doesn't make any sense.""There are about four million tipped workers in the United States, roughly 2.5 percent of all employment, as estimated by the Yale University Budget Lab.This group includes waiting staff, bartenders, and hairdressers. Tipped workers typically have lower weekly wages, and the Budget Lab estimates that around 37 percent of them did not pay any federal income tax in 2022.Once tax credits are considered, the situation becomes more complex, according to Goldwein from CRFB. The United States offers several refundable tax credits, allowing eligible taxpayers to reclaim these credits even if they do not earn enough to pay income taxes.""In other words, just because you pay no taxes doesn't mean you won't benefit from a plan to exempt taxes from tips.""The financial impact remains uncertain: While some congressional proposals target income tax alone, others aim to exempt tips from both income and payroll taxes.The candidates themselves have been unclear on the specifics. According to the Tax Foundation, any such change could cost at least $107 billion over the next decade, with other estimates suggesting even higher figures.Despite the political appeal of eliminating taxes on tips, some analysts caution that it may not be sound policy. They argue that this move could unfairly shift the tax burden onto workers who don't receive tips. Additionally, it might lead to tipping spreading to new professions, potentially resulting in a much larger financial impact than initially anticipated.","US presidential candidates Donald Trump and Kamala Harris agree that workers' tips should not be taxed.

Recently, the Iraqi government introduced a draft measure in the parliament that would lower the legal age of marriage for women from 18 to just 9. This implies that child marriage would become acceptable once more. This is perceived by activists and demonstrators in Iraq as a serious danger to women's rights since it leaves the young girls, who are only nine years old, open to forced marriage and ""child rape.""The legal age of marriage varies from nation to nation throughout the world.While some, like the United Kingdom, have set the age at 18 for both men and women, underage marriage is still permitted with parental approval. In India, the legal age of marriage is fixed at 18 for men and 21 for women. This year, the bill to raise the age at which women may marry expired. A number of nations allow child marriages. Any age of child can get married with the approval of their parents or father figure. Let's examine a few nations in the world for the highest and lowest marriage age.With few exclusions that vary by nation, most governments permit marriages between people under the age of 18. In 2010, 158 nations declared that the legal minimum age for women to marry without parental approval or consent was 18. Males are legally allowed to marry in 180 countries at the age of 18, while males can marry with parental approval in 105 countries. Many EU nations have strengthened their marriage rules in recent years, outlawing unions between people under the age of 18 or demanding judicial consent. Very similar legislation has also been passed by other emerging nations.","The legal age of marriage varies from nation to nation throughout the world.

DDos Attack: What is DDoS attack? Cyber assault Elon Musk says disrupted Donald Trump's interview on X,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-is-ddos-attack-cyber-assault-musk-says-disrupted-trumps-interview-on-x/articleshow/112482599.cms,"Understanding the DDoS attack

Impact and next steps

Tech billionaire Elon Musk reported a ""massive DDoS attack "" on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter , that disrupted the highly anticipated interview with former US President Donald Trump . The interview was scheduled for this morning, marking Trump's return to the platform ahead of the US Presidential elections in November.Musk addressed the situation on X, saying, ""There appears to be a massive DDoS attack on X .Working on shutting it down. Worst case, we will proceed with a smaller number of live listeners and post the conversation later."" The interview failed to air at its scheduled time, leaving users and viewers in limbo.A DDoS attack, or Distributed Denial-of-Service attack, is a type of cyber assault that disrupts normal traffic to a targeted server, service, or network by overwhelming it with a flood of internet traffic. The aim is to make the target inaccessible to legitimate users by exhausting its resources.Cybersecurity firm Fortinet describes a DDoS attack as a form of cybercrime where multiple compromised computer systems are used to generate excessive traffic toward the target. These exploited systems can include a variety of devices connected to the internet, all working in concert to overwhelm the target and prevent access to services.As explained by IT service management firm Cloudflare, DDoS attacks are highly disruptive, causing websites and servers to become slow, unresponsive, or completely offline. These attacks can last anywhere from hours to days, causing significant damage and often requiring extensive recovery efforts.Microsoft has also warned about the dangers of DDoS attacks, noting that they can lead to service delays, data breaches, and exploitation of security vulnerabilities. During a DDoS attack, multiple compromised computers flood a single target, effectively pushing out legitimate users and disrupting services.The disruption of the Trump interview highlights the vulnerabilities that even major platforms like X face in the face of coordinated cyber attacks. Musk's quick acknowledgment of the issue and his plan to limit live listeners while posting the conversation later shows an effort to mitigate the damage.While the full impact of the attack is still being assessed, this incident underscores the growing threat of cyberattacks in the digital landscape, particularly as high-profile events and personalities draw the attention of malicious actors.As of now, Musk and his team at X are working to resolve the situation, with updates expected as the platform recovers from the attack. In the meantime, the postponed interview with Trump remains one of the most talked-about events, further amplified by the cyberattack that attempted to silence it.","Elon Musk reported a ""massive DDoS attack "" on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter.
