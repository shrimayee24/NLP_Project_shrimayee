'I am not Christian': When Sonia's reaction surprised Aiyar



NEW DELHI: Senior Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar reflected on his long-standing yet limited interactions with Sonia, Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi , and expressed the irony of his political journey, saying his career was both made and unmade by the Gandhis.During an exclusive interview with PTI, he mentioned that aside from one occasion, he had limited meaningful interactions with Rahul Gandhi , and he had only spent time with Priyanka Gandhi on two occasions.“For 10 years, I was not given an opportunity to meet Sonia Gandhi one-on-one. I was not given an opportunity, except once, of spending any meaningful time with Rahul Gandhi. And I have not spent time with Priyanka except on one occasion, no, two occasions. She comes on the phone to me, so I’m in touch with them. So, the irony of my life is that my political career was made by the Gandhis and unmade by the Gandhis,"" he told PTI.Aiyar recounted the time when Congress ""had two disasters taking place"" in 2012, with Sonia Gandhi falling ill and Manmohan Singh going through six bypass surgeries.He said that the party had chosen Pranab Mukherjee as the prime minister instead of Manmohan Singh, and latter as the President, Congress wouldn't have lost in 2014 Lok Sabha polls ""by this massive humiliating defeat that we actually had.""“You see, in 2012, we had two disasters taking place: one was that Sonia Gandhi fell very ill, and Dr Manmohan Singh had six bypasses. So, we were crippled at the head of the government and at the head of the party,"" he said.""...if Dr Manmohan Singh had become the President and Pranab had become the PM, I still think we would have lost in 2014 (Lok Sabha polls), but not by this massive humiliating defeat that we actually had, where we fell to 44 seats...,” he added.Aiyar recalled how Sonia Gandhi reacted when he wished her ""Merry Christmas"" once.""And she says, ‘I’m not a Christian.’ Naturally, I was completely taken aback. But I think she does not see herself as a Christian,"" he said.""Like I don’t see myself as belonging to any particular religion. I am a non-believer, and I’m quite ready to say that. But, being a non-believer doesn’t mean I disrespect religions. What it means is that I respect all religions equally,” he added.Mani Shankar Aiyar is a former diplomat, having served in the Indian Foreign Service. He represented the Mayiladuthurai constituency of Tamil Nadu in the 10th, 13th, and 14th Lok Sabha, and was also a nominated member of the Rajya Sabha.","Mani Shankar Aiyar reflected on his long-standing yet limited interactions with Sonia, Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi.

‘We scoured country for art talent that will shine at upcoming AOI festival’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/we-scoured-country-for-art-talent-that-will-shine-at-upcoming-aoi-festival/articleshow/116322555.cms,"Alka Pande. (Photo/BCCL)

In the country’s busy art calendar, The Art of India has managed to carve a special niche for itself. In an interview, Delhi-based art historian and author Alka Pande, who has curated the forthcoming editions of the event in Delhi and Mumbai, talks about her attempt to capture the spirit of Indian art

The Indian art market is booming. According to the 2024 Hurun India Art List, sales by the top 50 artists reached a record-breaking Rs 301 crore, a 19% increase from 2023. So, this is a great time to host an art event but how does it stand apart from other art fairs in the country?



You have introduced a new section called Hidden Gems. Can you tell us about that?



There are several artists from Kerala who have made it big nationally, thanks to some great fine arts colleges and the Kochi Biennale. You attempt to shine a new spotlight on artists from Tamil Nadu. Can you elaborate?



In the last edition of The Art of India, the section on indigenous art drew much appreciation. How have you improved on it this time?



In this time of war and conflict, how important of a role does art play?



When the economy is booming, the art market always sees an upsurge, and this is what is happening in India right now. In my opinion, it is always a good time to host an art event. I would like to make a clear distinction between other fairs and initiatives like The Art of India (AOI). Those are more like trade fairs where the organisers either cobble together or select successful, well-known art galleries from India and abroad, and provide commercial spaces for selling. However, AOI is very different from such commercial art fairs in the country. For one, it is a completely curated arts initiative telling the story of Indian art, including traditional, sacred, modern, contemporary and indigenous. It showcases both the tangible and intangible heritage of the country, informing and bringing in a thoughtful, reflexive display of art practices.While showing the masters, it is also showcasing tomorrow’s blue chip, in addition to the cultural diversity and the plural culture of India. The Art of India is more about informing the general public about the history of Indian art and the cultural signifiers of Indian artistic practice.I have used ‘Hidden Gems’ as a deliberate title. In this country of 1.4 billion, there are thousands of art graduates not only from well-known art institutions but also those working outside the more structured art space. There are also numerous self-taught artists, as well as folk and tribal artists, who have been trained in the traditional ‘guru-shishya’ parampara. These artists are important culture bearers and carry within themselves vast knowledge systems and Indic traditions through their artworks. I have travelled the length and breadth of the country, seeking out artists who work quietly and consistently. These artists often live in the margins, and change often begins there, taking a while to reach the center. It is these artists — some of whom have been overlooked, such as master printmaker Haren Das — that I aim to make more visible.Kerala enjoys a unique status, and I may compare it to Bengal. Artists from Kerala not only possess skill but also benefit from a rich legacy of mural traditions, temple architecture, and cultural dance forms.Establishment of the first-ever Indian biennale, the Kochi-Muziris Biennale in 2011, also gave a huge boost and a fillip to artists from the region. I feel, however, that Tamil Nadu, despite its rich artistic legacy from the Government College of Arts and Crafts and its architectural heritage in places like Thanjavur, has somewhat fallen into the shadows. It was consciously decided to include artists from Tamil Nadu who have their own distinct artistic language but have somehow been overlooked.Folk and tribal artists provide a deep cultural connection to the essence of Indian tradition, philosophy, and myths. Indigenous artists are great storytellers; they are also guardians of ecology. Indian indigenous art, to some extent, is the most significant reflection of the spirit of India. This year’s AOI will introduce some tribal art that has not previously been seen on art platforms or in galleries.War, conflict, migration, political unrest and climate change have made it an increasingly challenging world. I believe art uplifts, informs, builds cross-cultural bridges, and unites people through the heart. It erases man-made borders and serves as a panacea for much of the conflict.",Art historian and author Alka Pande has curated the forthcoming editions of The Art of India in Delhi and Mumbai.

NEW DELHI: In a seamless coordinated effort, the fourth and last National Lok Adalat for this year, organised by National Legal Services Authority ( NALSA ), settled 1.45 crore cases, and importantly, prevented 1.22 crore fresh cases entering the system, which is already groaning under a monstrous pendency of 4.65 crore cases.Working with the motto 'Resolving Disputes, Restoring Harmony', Lok Adalats held on Saturday in all states, except Rajasthan, settled a total of 1.45 crore cases, including 1.22 crore pre-litigation cases and 23.7 lakh pending cases in trial courts. This is the first national Lok Adalat held under the guidance of NALSA patron-in-chief and CJI Sanjiv Khanna and NALSA executive chairman Justice B R Gavai.Lok Adalats in Rajasthan would be held on Dec 21 and Dec 22, following the completion of election process to district bar associations.NALSA's member secretary Bharat Parashar said the increasing success of Lok Adalats with every passing year reflected the public trust in the mechanism that is affordable.According to officer on special duty at NALSA, Shreya Arora Mehta, total settlement amount for these cases is approximately Rs 7,462 crore, which is likely to see a northward trend as final figures of settled amounts are yet to come in from many state legal services authorities till late evening.","Lok Adalats held on Saturday in all states, except Rajasthan, settled a total of 1.45 crore cases.

Three and half months after the national medical register portal was launched, less than 6,500 doctors have registered and only 284 of these have been approved. At the current pace of registration, it would take 40 years to register the estimated 12 lakh doctors currently practicing in India to complete the approval process of those registered.Union health minister J P Nadda inaugurated National Medical Register (NMR) Portal of National Medical Commission (NMC) for registration of all MBBS doctors eligible for registration in India. ""The uniqueness of NMR is that it is linked with Aadhaar ID of the doctors which ensures the individual's authenticity,"" said a statement issued by health ministry. It added that NMR portal, a combined effort of National Health Authority (NHA) and NMC, will ensure dynamic, authentic, and consolidated data on doctors.Though govt claimed that ""the speedy and easy registration process on the portal will facilitate the timely updation of the data"", in reality, doctors have been facing several problems with registration.""I registered on the portal on Aug 24, the day after it was opened. The Kerala State medical council approved and confirmed my registration to NMC. Yet during the last 110 days, my application has been returned with irrelevant queries four times, which include queries on the change in the names of the University and the state medical council. They have asked me to file an affidavit regarding the name in Aadhaar card not matching the existing registration, which predates Aadhaar. Even today, my registration is not done,"" said Dr KV Babu, an ophthalmologist and an RTI activist whose RTI application revealed how slowly the registration process is happening.The NMR is mandated under Section 31 of the NMC Act, 2019. ""If they cannot put together a digital database for just 12 lakh doctors who come through a highly regulated education system, can you imagine them being able to create databases for other categories in healthcare who would be well over 50 lakh and whose training is very poorly regulated?"" asked a senior doctor who retired from a government college.","Three and half months after the national medical register portal was launched, less than 6,500 doctors have registered.

'Has to be earned': Omar Abdullah on Congress leading INDIA bloc charge,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/has-to-be-earned-omar-abdullah-to-congress-on-india-bloc-leadership-debate/articleshow/116317428.cms,"'Has to be earned': Omar Abdullah to Congress on INDIA bloc leadership debate

NEW DELHI: Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah has called on the Congress party to actively demonstrate its leadership within the INDIA opposition alliance .Abdullah, speaking in his first interview since returning to the chief minister's office in October, acknowledged the Congress party's national presence and its status as the largest opposition party in Parliament. He stated that these factors make the party a ""natural"" leader of the opposition. However, he also highlighted growing concerns among alliance partners.Abdullah, while recognizing the Congress' significant position as a pan-India party and the largest opposition in Parliament, emphasized that leadership ""has to be earned"" and cannot be taken for granted.“By virtue of being the single largest party in Parliament, and also having the leader of opposition in both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, the fact that they have a pan-India footprint, which no other party can lay claim to, they are natural sort of leaders of an opposition movement,” Abdullah told PTI.Abdullah noted some allies feel the Congress isn't working hard enough to maintain its leadership position. He said, “Yet there is a sense of disquiet among some of the allies because they feel the Congress is ‘not doing enough to justify it or to earn it or to keep it. That’s something the Congress might wish to consider.’”He praised Sonia Gandhi's role within the alliance but declined to comment directly on statements by other leaders suggesting alternative leadership.The chief minister also criticized the INDIA bloc 's infrequent meetings and lack of a consistent engagement strategy. He believes the alliance's current sporadic approach is ineffective. “Our existence can’t just be about six months before Parliament elections. Our existence has to be something more than that,"" he stated.He added that a regular schedule of interactions is necessary for the alliance to function effectively. “You need to have a programme of regular interactions,” he explained, adding “not that you just come alive once Lok Sabha elections are announced and suddenly start talking and trying to work things out”.Abdullah expressed dissatisfaction with the Congress party's performance during the Jammu and Kashmir assembly elections , where the National Conference and Congress formed an alliance. He also highlighted the Congress party's need to analyze its performance in recent elections and improve its seat distribution strategies. He noted recurring tensions within alliances in several states.Regarding the Congress party’s potential participation in the Jammu and Kashmir government, Abdullah explained that ministerial positions are limited and currently allocated based on the number of legislators.He stated that the Congress party's participation is contingent upon the restoration of statehood for Jammu and Kashmir. “So for the time being, they’ve made it very clear that so long as J&K remains a union territory, they’ll stay out. Once statehood is restored, then that will change. So we hope that when they’re done fighting in Parliament for other things, they will also talk about statehood for J&K.” he said.","Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah has called on the Congress party to actively demonstrate its leadership within the INDIA opposition alliance.

Indian students in Canada in panic after Ottawa seeks documents afresh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indian-students-in-canada-in-panic-after-ottawa-seeks-docus-afresh/articleshow/116300386.cms,"Representative image

HYDERABAD: Indian students studying in Canada have reported receiving emails asking them to resubmit crucial documents such as study permits, visas and educational records, including marks and attendance.The request from Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada (IRCC), a government department that deals with foreign students, caused widespread panic among international students, many of whom hold visas with up to two years' validity.The development comes as IRCC tightens its policies to regulate the influx of international students, introducing stricter financial requirements and exploring potential caps on student admissions. ""I was a bit shocked when I received the email. My visa is valid until 2026, yet I was asked to submit all my documents again,"" said Avinash Kaushik, a postgraduate student from Hyderabad studying in Surrey, British Columbia. ""They even want proof of attendance, marks, where we are working part-time, etc.,"" he added.Last week, a similar surge in such emails was reported among students from Punjab. Some were even asked to visit IRCC offices in person to verify their credentials. ""Many students are confused and worried,"" said Avinash Dasari, a student from Hyderabad studying in Ontario.Also read: Canada stops SDS, fast-track popular student permit scheme for international students In recent years, Canada has experienced a significant surge in international student enrolment, with Indian students making up a substantial part of this group. According to the ministry of external affairs, Canada hosts the largest number of Indian students, with 4.2 lakh enrolled, followed by the US with 3.3 lakh Indian students.The sudden cascade of emails left students feeling uncertain about their future. ""We chose Canada for its welcoming environment, but this feels unfair,"" said Manisha Patel, a business management student from Adilabad now in British Columbia.Also read: Why Canada suspended its popular student visa programme and its effects on Indian applicants Many students are urging IRCC to provide clearer communication and address their concerns. In the meantime, experts have advised students to act promptly on document submissions to avoid potential issues. ""This move appears to be part of Canada's broader strategy to control the number of international students,"" said Mehbub Rajwani, an immigration consultant in Toronto. ""Caps and financial requirements being introduced are a clear signal. This move could also be to filter out genuine students as many change their designated learning institution and shift to one where there is no restriction on attendance so they can work in Canada,"" he added.""If students don't comply with these requests on time, it could lead to visa cancellations or future complications. We recommend students to follow the instructions in the emails carefully,"" he said.","Indian students studying in Canada have reported receiving emails asking them to resubmit crucial documents.

NEW DELHI: In the proposed bills on ' one nation one election ', to be tabled in Lok Sabha Monday, the government has argued that there is an imperative need for holding simultaneous elections for various reasons as polls have become expensive and time-consuming.In the Constitution (129th) Amendment Bill, 2024, the government has stated that imposition of a Model Code of Conduct in several parts of the country that are poll-bound puts on hold entire development programmes and causes disruption of normal public life.The bill proposes to insert a new Article 82A - simultaneous elections to the House of the People (Lok Sabha) and all legislative assemblies - and to amend Article 83 (Duration of Houses of Parliament), Article 172 (Duration of State Legislatures) and Article 327 (power of Parliament to make provision with respect to elections to Legislatures).It also provides that after its enactment, a notification is to be issued by the president on the date of the first sitting of Lok Sabha after a general election, and that date of the notification will be called the appointed date. The tenure of Lok Sabha will be five years from that appointed date. The tenure of all state assemblies, constituted by elections to assemblies after the appointed date and before the expiry of the full-term of Lok Sabha, shall come to an end on the expiry of the full term of the House.""Thereafter, all general elections to the House of the People and all legislative assemblies shall be held together simultaneously. In case of dissolution of the House of the People or a legislative assembly, sooner than the full term of the House of the People or the legislative assembly, the term of the House or assembly constituted pursuant to elections shall be for the unexpired term of the House or the assembly,"" the bill stated. The bill pointed out that the general elections to Lok Sabha and all state assemblies were held simultaneously in the years 1951-52, 1957, 1962 and 1967. ""However, due to premature dissolution of some legislative assemblies in 1968 and 1969, the cycle of holding polls simultaneously with the House of the People got disrupted,"" it stated.The govt has also listed another bill, which needs a simple majority for passage in Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha. The Union Territories Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2024, proposes to make ""consequential amendments"" to the Govt of Union Territories Act, 1963, (related to Puducherry), the Govt of National Capital-Territory of Delhi Act, 1991, and the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019, to ""align the holding of simultaneous elections"" along with Lok Sabha and state assemblies.",Proposed bills on 'one nation one election' to be tabled in Lok Sabha Monday.

DEHRADUN: The Indian Military Academy 's Passing Out Parade was alive with the crackle of marching boots and the murmur of proud families. Among the newly commissioned officers, one story seemed to weigh heavier in the air: Lt Kabilan V, a 23-year-old from a small village near Madurai stood with quiet dignity as his father, Vetriselvam P, looked on from a wheelchair. The older man's hands, worn from years as a daily wage labourer , rested idly on his lap, his body semi-paralysed by a stroke he suffered three months ago after hauling an unforgiving load. Beside them was a framed photograph of Panmaiyammal, Kabilan's late mother, whose death three years ago from cancer and Covid-19 marked a profound absence in the family's small circle of triumph.For Kabilan, the path to this moment had been steep and unyielding. ""I failed so many times,"" he said, the weight of those years softened by his hard-won smile. ""But I had to get into the defence forces , and I did it. This is not just my personal success; it belongs to everyone who aspires to join the Indian Army. If someone like me, the son of a daily wage labourer who earned Rs 100 a day, can make it, then anyone can.""Growing up in the dusty lanes of Melur village in Tamil Nadu, Kabilan attended a govt school before earning a degree in civil engineering from Anna University. He chased a dream many deemed too far-fetched for him. Year after year, he applied to the Army, exploring every entry category - from NCC to Graduate entries - and faced rejection at every turn. Still, he persisted. ""Courage inspires me,"" Kabilan said, distilling his journey into a phrase as unassuming as the man himself.But courage was not all he had. After losing his mother, Kabilan took on the duty of supporting his family. His younger brother was preparing for the civil services, and their father's health was failing. Kabilan balanced his studies with a demanding job as a waterboat supervisor under Delta Squad, a voluntary rescue squad under the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF).""He had to sustain his family while chasing his dream,"" said Sub Lt (Retd) Sugal Esan , Kabilan's mentor, who attended the ceremony to witness the moment. ""During the Chennai and Kanyakumari floods, he was part of our rescue team. Along with other volunteers, he saved almost 200 lives.""The dual responsibilities of work and study would have crushed many, but he held firm. ""I would go for work from 10 am to 4 pm, and after returning home, from 6 to 10 pm, I would do my studies with a group of students aspiring to crack this prestigious exam to join the forces,"" he said. That effort and sacrifice eventually bore fruit. His uniform now bears the insignia of the Para regiment-a mark of his next chapter in the Army. ""Learn things, fail better, and you will get success. Your determination and perseverance are the keys to your entry door to success,"" he said.","Lt Kabilan V, a 23-year-old from a small village near Madurai, is an officer in the Indian Army.

Watch: Rahul Gandhi's Lok Sabha gaffe leaves NDA MPs in splits

LIVE: Shri Rahul Gandhi | 75th anniversary | Adoption of the Constitution.

NEW DELHI: Rahul Gandhi , leader of the opposition in Lok Sabha, made a faux pas while addressing the House during the debate on the Constitution on Saturday.The Congress leader, while narrating an incident from the Hindu epic Mahabharata, addressed a 7-year-old ""young man"" instead of a kid, in reference to Eklavya, leaving the NDA MPs in splits.""Thousands of years ago in a dense forest, a 'yuva' (youth) ... a 'yuva' of 6-7 years of age ...

When you handover India's ports, airports and defence industry to Adani, you cut off the thumbs of all fair play business of India who work honestly,"" Rahul Gandhi said.The BJP's I-T cell chief Amit Malviya took a dig at Rahul Gandhi over the gaffe, calling him the ""undisputed king of bloopers"".The Congress leader also quoted VD Savarkar to attack the BJP, saying the Hindutva ideologue ""did not find anything"" Indian about India's Constitution and that he was more inclined towards Hindu scripture Manusmriti than the Constitution that the constituent assembly prepared.Rahul Gandhi, including in his recent speeches, has been invoking Gods, Hindu scriptures and symbols to make political attacks on the BJP.In his last speech in Parliament, Rahul Gandhi invoked the ""Chakravyuha"" of Mahabharata to accuse the Narendra Modi government of spreading fear and alleged that power was centred around only 6 people.""Thousands of years ago, in Kurukshetra, six people trapped Abhimanyu in a 'Chakravyuh' and killed him. I did a little research and found out that 'Chakravyuha' is also known as 'Padmavuyh' - which means 'Lotus formation'. Chakravyuh' is in the shape of a Lotus. In the 21st century, a new 'Chakravyuh' has been formed - that too in the form of a Lotus,"" Rahul had said.""The Prime Minister wears its symbol on his chest. What was done with Abhimanyu, is being down with India - the youth, farmers, women, small and medium businesses. Abhimanyu was killed by six people. Today, too there are six people in the centre of 'Chakravyuha',"" he had further alleged.","Rahul Gandhi, leader of the opposition in Lok Sabha, made a faux pas while addressing the House during the debate on the Constitution. The Congress leader, while narrating an incident from the Hindu epic Mahabharata, addressed a 7-year- old ""young man"" instead of a kid, in reference to Eklavya.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116314528,imgsize-995152,width-400,resizemode-4/116314528.jpg"

NEW DELHI: TDP MP Lavu Sri Krishna Devarayalu, during debate on the Constitution in Lok Sabha Saturday, expressed concerns about the next delimitation being done on population criteria, arguing that southern states stand to lose in the process while northern states would gain politically.The MP said if delimitation is done on the basis of population, the calculation is that seats with four states - UP, Bihar, MP and Rajasthan - will go up from present 169 to 324, while those of Andhra, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnataka will increase marginally from present 129 to 164 seats. ""This will not be helpful in federalism,"" he said, urging that benefit be given to states which have witnessed a decrease in population.Devarayalu demanded that a time limit should be fixed for governors to give assent to bills cleared by state assemblies.

Rahul cites Sambhal row, says BJP spreads hate everywhere

NEW DELHI: Seeking to corner BJP during a discussion on Constitution in Parliament, Congress MP Rahul Gandhi on Saturday said the saffron party's ""supreme leader"" - V D Savarkar - had called ' Manusmriti ' better than the Constitution and asked if BJP wasn't mocking him by praising Ambedkar and the Constitution.Rahul invoked the legend of Eklavya being forced to chop off his thumb. Likening Eklavya's thumb to his craft, and aspiration, Rahul said BJP ""is out to cut the thumb of the entire country"" - youth, entrepreneurs, SC, ST, OBCs, farmers and minorities.In his just under half-an-hour speech on the 75-year journey of the Constitution, Rahul Gandhi said the Constitution is a modern document, but it has the voice of ancient India comprising wisdom of philosophers like Basavanna, Mahavir, Phule, Ambedkar and Kabir.But, quoting the Hindutva icon, he said, ""Your supreme leader Savarkar says, 'The worst thing about the Constitution of India is that there is nothing Indian about it. Manusmriti is the scripture that is most worshippable after the Vedas, and which, from ancient times, has been the basis of our culture, customs, thought, and practice. This book for centuries has codified the spiritual and divine march of our nation. Today, Manusmriti is law'.""Rahul asked, ""Do you (BJP) support your leader's words? But when you speak about defending the Constitution, you are ridiculing Savarkar, you are abusing Savarkar, you are defaming Savarkar.""As he framed the Mahabharat battle in Kurushektra in these days as ""Constitution vs Manusmriti"", Rahul said INDIA bloc represents defenders of the Constitution.""You (BJP-RSS) praise these people (Ambedkar, etc) hesitatingly because you have to. But the truth is that you want India to be run the way it used to be run,"" he said.Elaborating on the Eklavya metaphor , Rahul said the ""thumb of youth is cut through paper leaks and Agniveer scheme; the thumb of fair businessmen is chopped off by giving Dharavi, ports, airports, defence industry to Adani and Ambani"". He said backward classes are being hurt through lateral entry in govt jobs, which have no provision of reservation, while farmers' demand for support price is rejected. He demanded caste census and removal of 50% cap on reservation ""to show the country whose thumb you have cut"".Having met the family of deceased victim of Hathras gangrape that took place four years ago, Rahul said the family is confined to their house while the accused are roaming freely and threatening the girl's kin. ""Where in the Constitution is it written that rapists can roam freely while the victim would be shut in their house? It may be in Manusmriti, but not in the Constitution,"" he said.On Sambhal police firing on Muslims, he asked where was it written in the Constitution that innocents can be shot dead. ""Wherever you go, you pit one religion against the other. You spread hatred. Where is it written in the Constitution that it can be done?"" he added.Rahul said Ambedkar's three concepts of political, social and economic equality do not exist now.","Rahul invoked the legend of Eklavya being forced to chop off his thumb.

BENGALURU: Congress government in Karnataka has initiated legal action in the alleged Covid-19 scam by registering an FIR regarding the misappropriation of Rs 167 crore in the procurement of PPE kits and related medical supplies between Sept 2020 and June 2021.Dr Vishnuprasad M, the chief accounting officer and financial adviser to medical education department, filed a complaint detailing alleged financial misconduct involving government officials, elected representatives, and private enterprises. Among the accused are medical education department former director Dr Girish PG, Raghu PG from accounts and audit department, and health equipment officer Muniraju N. The probe also involves private entities such as Laj Exports from Bengaluru and Prudent Management Solutions from Mumbai.The FIR cites govt records revealing extensive procurement of medical supplies, including 15.5 lakh PPE kits valued at Rs 203.6 crore and 42.1 lakh N-95 masks costing Rs 9.7 crore.The complaint centres on a specific contract approved on Aug 18, 2020 for Covid care supplies worth Rs 41.3 crore. Laj Exports was awarded the contract to supply 2.5 lakh PPE kits at Rs 1,312.5 per unit, with a 15-day delivery timeline.

""In America, non-whites (coloured) got voting rights in 1965,"" he said during a debate in Lok Sabha on 75 years of the Constitution's adoption.He shared survey reports on how 48% in the EU were discriminated against, with most of them being Muslims.

""They are safe here. That's why minorities come to India. Then why is it said that the minorities aren't protected in the country,"" Rijiju asked. ""Some incidents can occur between majority and minority communities, or between individuals, or within households, but to say Sikhs aren't being allowed to go to gurdwara, Muslims are being stopped from going to dargah, is wrong. We shouldn't say things that diminish the image of our country.""A brief altercation occurred during Rijiju's speech, when SP chief Akhilesh Yadav rose to point out how minorities were being disenfranchised from their right, an apparent reference to allegations of Muslims being blocked from voting in the recent byelections in UP.

'

Constitution gave people strength to recognise they have right to justice and are capable of raising voice against government.

Our Independence struggle was a unique one in the world as it was based on truth, non-violence

A few people from the bereaved families of Sambhal had come to meet us. There were two children among them - Adnan and Uzair. One of them was my son's age and the other was younger, 17 years of age. Their father was a tailor. The tailor had just one dream - that he would get his children educated, one son would become a doctor and the other too would be successful. The Police shot their father dead. The 17-year-old Adnan told me that he would grow up to be a doctor and realise his father's dream. This dream and hope was instilled in his heart by the Constitution of India

Government trying to weaken reservation through lateral entry, privatisation

Today, people of the country are demanding that there be a caste census. Colleague of the ruling side mentioned this, the mention is also being made only because of these results in the Lok Sabha elections. The caste census is essential so that we know the condition of everyone and policies can be made accordingly

It is people's demand that caste census is conducted

If not for Lok Sabha poll results, they (BJP) would have begun changing Constitution

BJP talks about past, they should talk what they are doing now; is Nehru responsible for everything

Nehru's name can be erased from books and speeches but not his role in Independence struggle, nation-building

Through lateral entry and privatisation, this government is trying to weaken reservation. Had these not been the results of Lok Sabha elections, they would have also started working on changing the Constitution. The truth is that they are repeatedly speaking about Constitution because in these elections they have come to know that the people of this country will keep the Constitution of this country safe. Winning while almost losing these elections, they have realised that the discussions about changing the Constitution won't work in this country

While our Constitution gave 'protective shield' of unity, seeds of discord and hatred being sown now

Seems PM Modi hasn't understood that it is 'Bharat ka Samvidhan' not 'Sangh ka Vidhan'

BJP cannot maintain unity, we saw it in Sambhal (Uttar Pradesh) and Manipur; they have created an atmosphere of fear

BJP cannot maintain unity, we saw it in Sambhal (Uttar Pradesh) and Manipur; they have created an atmosphere of fear The one, whose name you sometimes hesitate in speaking out, while speaking fluently at other times to use it to save yourself - he set up HAL, BHEL, SAIL, GAIL, ONGC, NTPC, Railways, IIT, IIM, Oil Refineries and several PSUs.

Gandhi pointed to the reduced numbers of the BJP in Lok Sabha elections as forcing them to talk about the Constitution more often. Further she said, had the Lok Sabha elections not gone the way it did, BJP would have started working on changing the Constitution.Gandhi also hit out at PM Modi, saying the PM doesn't understand ""Bharat ka Samvidhan"" but ""Sangh ka Vidhan"".Gandhi also framed the Lateral entry scheme pushed by the government, which is currently under a JPC deliberation, as an attempt by the government to weaken reservations in the country.

Gandhi further accused the Modi government of favoring big business intrests over common people and said the ruling dispensation had sold everything to them. ""Country is watching 1.4 billion people being ignored to save one person with all wealth, ports, roads, mines being given to him,"" she charged.Further, Gandhi suggested holding a ballot to resolve ongoing political debates, saying, ""Conduct elections through a ballot, and the truth will be revealed.""Later after the speech, Rahul Gandhi heaped praise for her sister, saying it was a""wonderful speech.

When I go to attend international conferences where there is a discussion on road accidents, I try to hide my face.”Gadkari’s admission came during the Question Hour, where he also stressed the need for significant changes in human behavior, societal attitudes, and respect for the rule of law to improve road safety. Sharing a personal anecdote, the minister recounted a major accident involving him and his family several years ago, which required prolonged hospitalization.“By the grace of God, I and my family were saved. So I have my personal experience of accidents,” he said.Highlighting key factors contributing to road mishaps, Gadkari pointed to improper parking of trucks and lack of lane discipline as major issues. He noted that many accidents are caused by trucks parked haphazardly on roads. To address safety concerns, he announced directives for adopting international standards in bus body design, including equipping buses with hammers near windows for emergency escapes during accidents.The minister painted a grim picture of road safety in India, revealing that road accidents claim 1.78 lakh lives annually, with 60% of victims falling within the 18-34 age group.Among states, Uttar Pradesh recorded the highest number of fatalities, with over 23,000 deaths accounting for 13.7% of total road accident deaths, followed by Tamil Nadu (18,000 deaths, or 10.6%), Maharashtra (15,000 deaths, or 9%), and Madhya Pradesh (13,000 deaths, or 8%).In terms of cities, Delhi led the tally with over 1,400 deaths, followed by Bengaluru (915 deaths) and Jaipur (850 deaths).","Road accidents claim 1.78 lakh lives annually, with 60% of victims falling within the 18-34 age group.

VARANASI/BENGALURU: A Bengaluru police team reached UP's Jaunpur Thursday looking for the Singhania family accused of abetting the suicide of Subhash Atul , a senior AI executive at a leading automobile firm. But police met with little success as their houses were locked and phones switched off.Jaunpur Kotwali inspector Mithilesh Kumar Mishra said Atul's mother-in-law Nisha and her son Anurag had left their house on a motorbike Wednesday night. When some reporters camping there asked where they were going, Anurag replied his mother was unwell.According to neighbours, the Singhania family had moved in two months ago. Police have launched a manhunt and pasted a notice on the entrance of the house, asking residents to appear before the IO .""We are in constant touch with local police, and they are working with us to trace the suspects,"" DCP Shivakumar Gunare of Bengaluru police said.Atul, 34, took his life in his Bengaluru apartment early Monday amid a prolonged legal battle involving divorce, child custody, and a Rs 3.3 crore demand from his estranged wife Nikita Singhania. According to the FIR filed by Atul's brother Bikas, his estranged wife and her family allegedly demanded Rs 3 crore to drop police cases and Rs 30 lakh for visitation rights to see his four-year-old son. Bengaluru police registered a case against Nikita, her mother Nisha, brother Anurag, and uncle Sushil Singhania.His lawyer Dinesh Mishra said Thursday Atul was earning a monthly salary of Rs 84,000 and the family court in Jaunpur had ordered him in July to pay Rs 40,000 a month as maintenance for his son, which he might have found burdensome.Atul left behind a 24-page suicide note and an 81-minute video detailing alleged harassment by Nikita and his in-laws, and accused the family court judge of bias. However, his lawyer Mishra said the orders passed by the court were in accordance with the law.""The court did not mandate any compensation for his wife, as she was earning a sufficient income in Delhi. Atul might have found the Rs 40,000 payment steep. He had the option to challenge the order by appealing to higher courts, including HC,"" Mishra said.According to the lawyer, Atul never demonstrated violent behaviour or mood swings while appearing before family court. ""I suspect his wife and others might have demanded more money from him, forcing him to think they were blackmailing or extorting him."" Atul and Nikita met through a matrimonial site and got married on April 26, 2019, in Varanasi.

Nearly 400 passengers who were supposed to travel from Istanbul to Delhi and Mumbai on IndiGo flights have been stranded at the Turkiye airport for almost two days now.Passengers have now taken to social media to recount their experience.

'Surgery was painful': UnitedHealthcare CEO killer Luigi Mangione's social media posts indicate about his health struggles,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/surgery-was-painful-unitedhealthcare-ceo-killer-luigi-mangiones-social-media-posts-indicate-about-his-health-struggles/articleshow/116270935.cms,"Social media posts of Luigi Mangione , who was detained as a suspect in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, give an insight into his physical and mental health issues.Last year, following his spinal surgery for chronic back pain , he became an advocate for the procedure that positively transformed his life. He actively encouraged individuals facing similar conditions, to challenge medical professionals who suggested pain was inevitable.His Reddit posts discuss spondylolisthesis, a spinal condition where vertebral fractures cause misalignment. This can lead to severe pain when nerves are compressed.According to his social media posts, this condition, which can develop during childhood or through injury, began significantly affecting Mangione's life in recent years.Following his studies at the University of Pennsylvania, where he obtained bachelor's and master's degrees, he was employed at TrueCar, a Santa Monica-based car-buying website until 2023. He resided in Hawaii beginning January 2022. His back condition deteriorated, partly due to a surfing incident during his six-month residence at Surfbreak, a ""co-living"" accommodation in Honolulu.According to Josiah Ryan, who speaks for Surfbreak's owner and founder R.J. Martin, Mangione increasingly voiced concerns about his pain. The condition affected his ability to participate in recreational activities and exercise, and he worried about its impact on potential romantic relationships.""That was definitely a theme in his time there,"" Ryan said. ""He wasn't a big complainer. So it wasn't like he was bringing it up constantly. But the people who knew him knew this was a significant part of his life.""In July 2023, Mangione shared on Reddit his decision to undergo surgery.""I got caught in this loop for a year, all the while putting my life on hold in my 20's and damaging my nerves while I waffled on the decision. I have surgery scheduled in two weeks and I keep wondering why I was so afraid of it,"" he wrote.His posts indicated the procedure was successful. His X account displayed what seemed to be an X-ray showing a metal rod and multiple screws inserted in his lower spine.""Surgery was painful for the first couple days, but I was shocked that by day 7 I was on literally zero pain meds,"" Mangione posted on Reddit in August 2023. ""Obviously will be awhile until I get into rigorous activity, but it was way less of a big deal than I had anticipated.""In a post from July 2018, he discussed his academic challenges and thoughts of leaving university. However, he noted that ""staying in college has at least let me maintain some semblance of normality.""His final Reddit contribution was on May 17, with surrounding posts indicating stability and no apparent health complications. He appeared supportive of the surgical procedure he had undergone previously.In early April, he shared details about equipment chosen for an extended Asian backpacking adventure involving motorcycle travel, describing it as having ""the perfect balance between minimalism and practicality.""Later that month, he offered advice to another Reddit user experiencing back issues, suggesting persistent consultation with different surgeons and emphasising work inability if needed.""We live in a capitalist society,"" he wrote. ""I've found that the medical industry responds to these key words far more urgently than you describing unbearable pain and how it's impacting your quality of life.""However, his Reddit posts, did not contain direct criticism of health insurance industry profits. These sentiments apparently emerged later, as evidenced by a handwritten note discovered after his arrest for allegedly killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.The note mentions ""parasites"" within the healthcare system and criticises health insurers' influence and earnings, According to law enforcement officials. Upon his arrest in Pennsylvania, Mangione was heard shouting about an ""insult to the intelligence of the American people"" while being escorted into court by sheriff's deputies.Meanwhile, a senior New York City police official confirmed on Thursday to NBC New York that there was no evidence of Mangione ever having UnitedHealthcare insurance.Although the incident has led to questions about potential negative healthcare experiences, Mangione's 2023 post-surgery Reddit activity showed satisfaction with his treatment and relief from chronic pain. He advised others not to fear surgical complications and mentioned travelling to Asia for backpacking this year.Interestingly, the 26-year-old Ivy League alumnus appears to have ceased social media activity approximately six months ago, coinciding with his loss of contact with family and friends.Whilst his arrest has shocked his close circle, limited information exists about his recent physical and psychological wellbeing.Meanwhile, healthcare professionals acknowledge the complexities of treating back pain.""In the gross majority of treatments, surgery is when everything else has failed to provide relief,"" said Dr Jason Pittman, co-director of the Spine Centre at Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Centre. He said that doctors typically explore conservative treatments like physical therapy, injections or medications before considering surgery.Despite having health insurance, patients may face substantial surgical costs depending on deductibles and other variables, although Mangione's financial situation remains unclear.Dr Padma Gulur, a pain specialist at Duke Health, highlights that chronic back pain can substantially affect mental wellbeing.“If you have underlying mental health issues — anxiety, depression — your pain can be worse because you have way more suffering. But, the second aspect is pain can push you into anxiety and depression,” said Gulur.Additionally, details about Mangione's recent mental health remain unclear, though evidence suggests he was becoming increasingly isolated.According to police reports, his family filed a missing person report in San Francisco during November.During his university years, Mangione had documented his struggles with cognitive difficulties and sleep disturbances on Reddit.",Luigi Mangione was detained as a suspect in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.

OBJ's Miami stint falls short as he seeks new beginnings

Analyzing possible landing spots for Odell Beckham Jr.



In a move that has taken the NFL by surprise, the Miami Dolphins made a bold decision on Friday, parting ways with veteran wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. The three-time Pro Bowler, who had hoped for a fresh start with the Dolphins this season, is now seeking new opportunities as his stint in Miami comes to an unexpected end. Despite his star-studded past, Beckham's time in Miami never quite lived up to expectations, leaving many to wonder where the dynamic playmaker will land next.The Miami Dolphins made a bold move on Friday, releasing veteran wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr., as reported by NFL Network insider Tom Pelissero . Beckham, a three-time Pro Bowler, is now eyeing new opportunities, hopeful for a fresh start elsewhere.As Week 15 unfolded, Thursday Night Football saw the Los Angeles Rams face off against the San Francisco 49ers in a lackluster matchup that failed to spark much excitement at Levi's Stadium. However, the Dolphins stole the spotlight on Friday morning with their surprising decision regarding Beckham.Despite high expectations, Beckham has struggled this season, logging only nine receptions for 55 yards on 18 targets and failing to find the end zone. In the wake of OBJ's release, his former teammate Tyreek Hill shared a cryptic message on Twitter, hinting at the drama surrounding the situation.""Take advantage of your opportunity,"" Hill wrote on social media platform X. (via: Sportskeeda)After a short tenure with the Baltimore Ravens last season, Odell Beckham Jr. signed a one-year, $3 million contract with the Miami Dolphins this summer, with hopes of contributing as the third receiver behind Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle. However, things didn’t unfold as planned.A preseason setback sidelined Beckham to start the year on the physically unable to perform list. He was activated in early October, but his return was far from explosive. Despite his efforts, Beckham went without a catch in his first three games, managing only 33 snaps in total during his time in Miami. For the remainder of his contract, Beckham is still set to receive $200,000, according to NFL sources.Two teams that immediately stand out as potential landing spots for Odell Beckham Jr. are his former squads, the LA Rams and Baltimore Ravens. Following a pivotal Week 15 victory over the Niners, the Rams have slightly bolstered their playoff hopes. However, to truly make a push for a deep postseason run, they may still require additional playmakers, particularly in the receiving corps. On the other hand, the Ravens find themselves navigating some complications with Diontae Johnson, who was traded from the Panthers and recently handed a one-game suspension. This could spur the Ravens to search for more depth at wide receiver. Meanwhile, fan speculation has linked Beckham to other teams such as the Washington Commanders, Kansas City Chiefs, and Tampa Bay Buccaneers, all of whom may be vying for his dynamic presence on their rosters.Also Read : Alix Earle speaks out on boyfriend Braxton Berrios' challenges after season-ending injury","The Miami Dolphins released veteran wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. on Friday.

She cautioned that focusing on one player could create “hard feelings” within the WNBA. While her perspective highlighted the contributions of other rising stars, it overlooked Clark’s record-breaking performances and the visibility she’s brought to the league.What also caught attention was Clark’s acknowledgment of the disparities in sponsorships and media coverage for Black athletes. In her Time profile, she expressed a commitment to advocating for better representation, a stance Johnson supported.

Dwayne Haskins’ Widow Dismisses Lawsuit After Settlements in Wrongful Death Case



Kalabrya Haskins , widow of late NFL quarterback Dwayne Haskins, has voluntarily dismissed her lawsuit against 14 entities linked to her husband’s tragic 2022 death, per court records filed Wednesday. Haskins, 24, was fatally struck by a dump truck near Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood Airport on April 9, 2022. Acting as the estate’s personal representative, Kalabrya reached settlements with the involved parties, concluding the wrongful death case in Florida, her attorney Rick Ellsley confirmed.The case, which has been ongoing since her husband’s tragic death in 2022, was resolved with the final payment of the settlements.

He was fatally struck by a dump truck while walking along a highway near Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport. Reports revealed that he was stranded after running out of gas and was walking to find a station when the accident occurred.Kalabrya, serving as the personal representative of her late husband’s estate, filed the lawsuit in April 2023, alleging negligence and foul play. The suit claimed Haskins was drugged, blackmailed, and robbed before the incident. Toxicology reports indicated he had a blood alcohol level three times the legal limit and traces of ketamine and norketamine, substances often associated with recreational abuse.The lawsuit named 14 defendants, including the dump truck driver, the company responsible for the truck, the Florida Department of Transportation, a car rental service, and a nightclub Haskins visited prior to his death. By August 2023, Kalabrya had reached settlements with three major defendants, with additional agreements following soon after. The dismissal this week signifies the conclusion of all claims related to the case.Separately, Kalabrya is engaged in a legal battle with Haskins’ parents and sister, who accuse her of harassment over their use of Dwayne’s name and likeness for a nonprofit foundation.

BENGALURU: Nandan Nilekani said he stands by his view that India need not spend resources building another large language model (LLM). He was responding to a question from us on the view expressed recently by Google Research India director Manish Gupta that India will benefit from building a foundation model .""Foundation models are not the best use of your money. If India has $50 billion to spend, it should use that to build compute, infrastructure, and AI cloud. These are the raw materials and engines of this game,"" he said.Foundation models like the ones that OpenAI and Meta are building often cost billions of dollars because they are being trained on vast amounts of data using very expensive infrastructure.Nilekani has in the past stressed that India should focus on building use cases for AI on top of the LLMs that are available globally.Last month, Gupta had said at the Bengaluru Tech Summit that he ""respectfully disagreed"" with Nilekani's advice on prioritising use case building over building foundation models around AI. ""He is not preaching what he practised. He revolutionised India's technology landscape by starting with the basics.

In a recent social media exchange, Elon Musk spotlighted Singapore’s steep decline in fertility rates, a trend he described as an existential challenge. Responding to a post by Mario Nawfal—a prominent personality on X (formerly Twitter)—about the nation’s ""baby crisis"" and the potential role of robotics in addressing the issue, Musk remarked,This statement has reignited global discussions on the demographic struggles of developed nations, where falling birth rates pose long-term economic and social challenges. Musk, a vocal advocate for population growth, has frequently warned of the adverse consequences of shrinking populations, emphasizing the importance of addressing these issues for global sustainability. The post highlights concerns about aging societies and their impact on labor markets, innovation, and healthcare systems, while underscoring the rising interest in technologies like robotics to compensate for declining human workforce numbers.Singapore has been grappling with a steady decline in its Total Fertility Rate (TFR) over the last three decades. In 2023, the TFR reached a historic low of 0.97, marking the first time it has dipped below 1.0. This figure signifies that, on average, each woman in Singapore is having fewer than one child—far below the replacement level of 2.1 required to maintain a stable population.The primary drivers of Singapore’s fertility decline stem from evolving societal trends. Data from the Singapore government reveals that a growing number of women aged 25–34, considered prime childbearing years, are choosing to remain single. Additionally, the marital fertility rate among women in their 20s has seen a substantial decline, accounting for approximately 32% of the overall drop in TFR.Between 1990 and 2005, marital fertility rates among women aged 25–34 experienced a sharp decrease. While there was a slight recovery in 2023, the long-term trend remains concerning.Despite its demographic challenges, Singapore’s advancements in robotics and automation could help address labor shortages caused by a declining workforce. According to the International Federation of Robotics, Singapore ranks second globally in robot density, with 770 industrial robots per 10,000 workers. This technological prowess allows the country to sustain industries despite high labor costs and a relatively small manufacturing base.Musk’s interest in robotics is well-documented through Tesla’s investment in humanoid robots designed to perform repetitive or dangerous tasks. While he has not directly suggested robots as a replacement for human populations, his remarks hint at the potential for technology to mitigate the economic and social impacts of declining birth rates.Musk’s statement sparked widespread debate on social media, with opinions ranging from support to criticism.Some users highlighted Singapore’s strong immigration policies as a mechanism to counteract its population decline. The city-state has long relied on foreign talent and workers to supplement its labor force and sustain economic growth.Others pointed to deeper issues contributing to the reluctance to have children. Rising living costs, financial instability, and paycheck-to-paycheck lifestyles were frequently cited as barriers to family planning.Notably, many individuals expressed concerns about the affordability of raising children in an increasingly competitive and expensive environment.Singapore’s struggle with low fertility rates mirrors challenges faced by many developed nations, including Japan, South Korea, and certain European countries. Declining birth rates have far-reaching consequences, including:","Singapore has been grappling with a steady decline in its Total Fertility Rate (TFR) over the last three decades.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows.
