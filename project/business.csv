The current system is fine; economic progress is tremendous, and we have witnessed exponential economic growth and phenomenal infrastructure development.

We do not deceive our own people; we deceive the enemy. Our people are embraced. How can one sleep when the problems of farmers are not being solved swiftly? I call upon my farmer brothers that the resolution of problems in this country happens through dialogue and understanding. King Mahendra Pratap was known for this approach. An irretrievable confrontational stance is poor diplomacy,"" he added.Dhankhar also assured that the government will pay attention to farmers' issues and bring about the fastest resolution.""This country is ours, and it is affected by rural backgrounds. I believe that my farmer brothers, wherever they are, and whoever is active in any movement, my message will reach them. They will pay attention to it. You are more knowledgeable and experienced than I am. I am sure there will be a convergence of positive energy to bring about the fastest resolution to the problem of farmers,"" Dhankhar said.""We need to reflect. What has happened is in the past, but the path ahead must be right. The creation of a developed India begins from the land of farmers. The path to a developed Bharat is through the farmland.

Mum cops book EVM critic for 'false claims',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mum-cops-book-evm-critic-for-false-claims/articleshow/115877096.cms,"NEW DELHI: Acting on a complaint from the Maharashtra chief electoral officer (CEO), the Mumbai Cyber Police on Saturday registered an FIR against foreign-based EVM basher Syed Shuja in connection with a video showing him making ""false, baseless and unsubstantiated claims"" that he could hack and tamper EVMs in the recent state polls by isolating their frequency.Shuja was booked under section 318(4) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) and clauses 43(g) and 66D of the Information Technology Act, 2000.Shuja, who EC sources said is based in a ""third country"", was last in the news for having addressed a press conference in London on Jan 21, 2019, with a handkerchief covering his face as he made similar claims that EVMs could be hacked by isolating their frequency, and that the 2014 LS polls were rigged. He had, however, provided no proof in support of his shocking claims.There are reports that Shuja is in the US.EC had taken serious note of Shuja's mischievous claims at the London press event - where, interestingly, Congress's Kapil Sibal was present - timed months ahead of the 2019 LS polls. It had then directed the Delhi Police to file an FIR against him under Section 505(1)(b) of the Indian Penal Code, which deals with acts of public mischief through circulation of content that may cause fear or alarm in the public.Though the Delhi Police has, through the ministry of external affairs, repeatedly approached relevant authorities ""in the third country"" for help to investigate Shuja, there has been no forward movement on the other end. Sources in EC said while access to Shuja may be dependent on cooperation of a foreign govt, both the Delhi and Mumbai police will take all possible steps to identify and apprehend anyone within India who is in contact with individuals like Shuja or complicit in their malicious activities.""Such actions are a serious offence, and no one who is involved will be spared,"" a senior EC official told TOI.Regarding his latest video offering to hack EVMs in the Maharashtra polls for a hefty payment by isolating their frequency, which he claimed would alter the result, the Maharashtra CEO office clarified on X on Sunday that EVM being a standalone device, ""cannot be connected to any network including any WiFI or Bluetooth by any person whatsoever"". ""Therefore, question of manipulating EVMs does not arise. EVMs are completely tamper-proof,"" it said.Recalling that SC has time and again reposed faith in EVMs, the post on X also mentioned the FIR registered by the Delhi Police against Shuja in 2019 on EC's directions.Section 318(4) of BNS - under which Shuja has been booked - states that whoever cheats and dishonestly induces a person to be deceived to make, alter or destroy anything which is signed or sealed, shall be punished with imprisonment up to seven years, with a fine.","Mumbai Cyber Police on Saturday registered an FIR against foreign-based EVM basher Syed Shuja in connection with a video showing him making ""false, baseless and unsubstantiated claims"" Shuja was last in the news for having addressed a press conference in London on Jan 21, 2019, with a handkerchief covering his face as he made similar claims.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115877102,imgsize-60390,width-400,resizemode-4/115877102.jpg"
Health camps a tool for private hospitals to hike occupancy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/health-camps-a-tool-for-private-hospitals-to-hike-occupancy/articleshow/115875971.cms,"The practice of private hospitals organising medical camps to get more inpatients has come into focus with death of four patients in Ahmedabad following angioplasty which was deemed unnecessary. Often labelled as charitable or CSR activity, in reality, camps are marketing activities for private hospitals, including large corporate hospitals that are constantly trying to push up occupancy, say industry insiders.Average occupancy in most hospital groups is about 60-70%. Footfalls in camps are closely monitored by marketing departments with calculations of what percentage of camp attendance gets converted to inpatients. There are quarterly plans for how many camps or outreach clinics have to be organised in which locations and of what specialties. These camps are not only organised within the regions where the hospitals are located but also in other states, especially states seen as promising ""catchment areas"" such as Bengal and the North-East. While some tie up with local health facilities or diagnostic set ups to provide logistical support, others have their own agents who make local arrangements.""Hospital chains organise camps in the Andamans every week, despite the population being small. Most of these hospitals fly in super-specialists who do consultations and then refer patients back to the main hospitals for procedures. They aggressively target patients with heart, and bone and joint issues. A lot of valve replacement, stenting and knee replacements are being advised. Neurology and urology camps are also popular,"" said a doctor who did not want to be identified.In places with inadequate tertiary care facilities, the camps are advertised as an opportunity for consultation with ""eminent doctors"" who are ""flying in"" to provide ""world-class healthcare"" by conducting comprehensive health evaluation to provide personalised treatment plans .The bait is often free health check-up, a few free medicines or free consultations. In some camps, consultation charges have to be paid while registration is free. Tests that cost a few hundred rupees like blood sugar, HB and BP check, ECG, weight and BMI measurement are done in the name of detecting health problems early and many are referred for ""specialised treatment or surgery"", which could cost several thousands to a few lakh rupees, to the main hospital. ""There is no external audit on whether the procedures recommended are necessary or appropriate,"" said a doctor working for a corporate hospital.The marketing departments have access to the database of patients who attended the camp and their diagnosis to follow up with reminders via emails, messages and calls. They have the responsibility of modifying the offer if the patients seem unsure. The focus is on how to increase extraction from camps, and even a 15-20% conversion to inpatients is considered decent.",Private hospitals organise medical camps to get more inpatients.

Investigators believe the chats may provide crucial insights into the events leading to her death.According to the Powai police, Tuli had made a video call to Pandit shortly before taking her own life.Authorities said she died following an argument with Pandit.His police custody, which began four days ago, was extended based on his alleged failure to report Tuli's threats and his decision to enter her locked house without involving law enforcement.""Pandit's arrest stems from his failure to alert the police about Tuli's threats and his decision to access her locked residence without police involvement.

When questioned about the deleted messages, he stated he had threatened self-harm if she died.

On the one hand, he has the reputation as a key figure who resisted the British colonial control over India, and it is a fact that his defeat and death can be considered a turning point when it came to the fate of peninsular India,"" Jaishankar said.He also pointed out that in Tipu Sultan’s case, a ""particular narrative"" has been promoted over the years, which has largely focused on his anti-British stance while downplaying other dimensions of his rule.""History in all society is complicated, and the politics of the day often indulges in cherry-picking facts. To a considerable extent that has happened in the case of Tipu Sultan,"" he remarked. According to Jaishankar, this narrative focuses on the ""Tipu-English binary"" while excluding a broader and more nuanced understanding of his role in history.The EAM noted that the current political environment in India has allowed for ""alternative perspectives"" on historical figures like Tipu Sultan to emerge. He said, ""In the last decade, the changes in our political dispensation have encouraged the emergence of alternative perspectives and balanced accounts. We are no longer prisoners of a vote bank, nor is it politically incorrect to bring out inconvenient truths. There are many more subjects on which the same degree of objectivity is needed.""Jaishankar discussed the importance of studying history with an open mind and engaging in genuine debates. He emphasized that a pluralistic society and vibrant democracy require objective accounts of history. He suggested that much of India’s past has been edited to suit specific political or ideological purposes. ""How much of our past has been airbrushed, how awkward issues have been glossed over, how facts are tailored for regime convenience—these are basic questions which confront us all today,"" he said.Referring to Tipu Sultan’s actions in different regions, Jaishankar noted that opinions about him remain divided. While many remember him for resisting British colonial control, others have strong negative sentiments about his rule, particularly in regions like Mysore, Coorg, and Malabar.He acknowledged that Tipu Sultan’s resistance to the British was significant, saying, ""There can be no doubt that Tipu Sultan was fiercely and almost consistently anti-British. But how much of it was inherent and how much a result of their allying with his local rivals, that is difficult to distinguish.""The minister also highlighted Tipu Sultan’s alliances with foreign powers, which complicate a straightforward interpretation of his legacy. ""To counter British ambitions, Tipu Sultan had no hesitation in collaborating with the French and that makes a ‘straightforward anti-foreign narrative’ very difficult to assert,"" he said.Touching upon Tipu Sultan’s foreign policy, Jaishankar said Tipu reached out to the rulers of Turkey, Afghanistan, and Persia for support, often on the basis of shared religious ties. He noted that this reflects the historical context of the time, where the modern sense of nationhood was absent. ""Perhaps the truth is that the sense of nationhood, all of us have now, was simply not there then,"" he observed.Jaishankar praised Vikram Sampath’s book for providing a detailed and ""balanced"" account of Tipu Sultan’s life and the era he lived in. He said the book goes beyond being a simple biography, offering insights into politics, strategy, administration, sociology, and diplomacy. ""To call Sampath's book a biography would be a serious understatement. It is something very much more, capturing the flavour of a fast-moving and complicated era but offering insights into politics, strategy, administration, sociology and even diplomacy,"" he said.He also appreciated the challenges Sampath might have faced in presenting a more comprehensive view of Tipu Sultan, given the strong existing narratives. He emphasized that the book allows readers to make their own judgments by presenting a detailed context.Jaishankar concluded by reiterating the importance of objective historical accounts. He shared his perspective as someone who has experienced what he calls politically influenced historical narratives during his education. ""As a product myself of an institution that was at the centre of these politically driven endeavours, I could well appreciate the need to present an actual representation of history,"" he said.Jaishankar spoke about selective narratives at a time when, as part of the syllabus ""rationalization"" process, NCERT last year removed significant portions of Mughal history from its textbooks for Classes 7-12. As a result, Mughal history is now briefly covered in Class 7, touched upon in Class 8, omitted entirely in Classes 9 to 11, and included in a shortened form in Class 12.This reduction is not limited to school education. At the undergraduate level, Delhi University’s BA History Honours program has also revised its curriculum to exclude references to the Mughals. In the 2019-20 academic year, the syllabus for Semester 4 dropped the topic The Consolidation of Mughal Rule under Akbar from the course. This topic had previously covered Akbar’s military campaigns, administrative reforms, and responses to revolts and resistance."," External affairs minister (EAM) S Jaishankar attended the launch of historian Vikram Sampath's book Tipu Sultan at the India Habitat Centre in Delhi on Saturday.

Bangladesh carriers cancel 3 daily flights as flyer count nosedives,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bangladesh-carriers-cancel-3-daily-flights-as-flyer-count-nosedives/articleshow/115854778.cms,"No. of B'desh-Kol flights down by half since July

KOLKATA: At least two daily flights between Kolkata and Dhaka and one between Kolkata and Chittagong have been cancelled by airlines operating between the two countries as passenger count continues to nosedive in the wake of continued unrest in Bangladesh, attacks on minorities and curbs on travel due to Indian visa restrictions.Bangladesh's flag bearer, Biman Bangladesh, has cut operations between Kolkata and Dhaka from twice daily to a single flight a day. The country's private carrier, US-Bangla Airlines, has reduced the frequency to Dhaka from twice daily to once and has discontinued the flight to Chittagong.Indian carrier IndiGo still continues to operate its twice-daily schedule, but sources said the airline was closely following the situation in Dhaka. The dip in passenger loads over the past few months, which has further accentuated in recent days, was a cause for concern, they said.The number of flights from Kolkata to Dhaka/Chittagong has dipped from 125 in Sept to 97 in Nov. Consequently, the count of departing passengers has reduced from 15,479 in Sept to 12,747 in Nov. The number of arrivals to Kolkata from Bangladesh has dipped from 114 in Sept to 96 in Nov, resulting in a drop in passenger count from 12,540 in Sept to 10,121 now.Bangladeshi carriers have been the worst-hit due to the crisis in the country. Biman Bangladesh flights from Kolkata are down from 59 in July to 28 in Nov while US-Bangla Airlines has fared worse with flight departures down from 84 in July to 24 now.In contrast, IndiGo flight departures are down from 62 in July to 45 in Nov, while arrivals during this period are down from 64 in July to 44 now.While Bangladeshis who depend on Kolkata for both commerce and healthcare are majorly impacted, a section of the economy in Kolkata, particularly hotels, restaurants and hospitals that serve Bangladeshis, have been dealt a body blow. Hotel occupancy in the Marquis Street-Sudder Street belt is down to 20% while shops and restaurants in and around New Market have witnessed a 65%-70% slide in sales.""Tourism, both conventional and local, as well as business, are impacted by the ongoing turmoil there. For most middle-class Bangladeshis, India is a foreign country within reach for medical as well as religious tourism where affordability, food and language are not a barrier. Unless the situation gets resolved, everyone will feel the pinch,"" said Travel Agents' Association of India chairman (East) Anjani Dhanuka.","Bangladesh's flag bearer, Biman Bangladesh, has cut operations between Kolkata and Dhaka from twice daily to a single flight a day.

He called for the use of technology to reduce the workload of the constabulary and suggested that the police station be made the focal point for resource allocation.Discussing the success of hackathons in solving some key problems, the PM suggested deliberating on holding a National Police Hackathon as well. He highlighted the need for expanding the focus on port security and preparing a future plan of action in this regard.Recalling the contributions of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, India's first home minister, to the ministry of home affairs, Modi exhorted the security establishment, from the ministry to the police station level, to pay homage to him on his 150th birth anniversary next year by resolving to set and achieve a goal on any aspect that stands to improve the police's image, professionalism and capabilities. He urged police forces to modernise and realign themselves with the vision of 'Viksit Bharat'.During the three-day conference, in-depth discussions were held on challenges to national security , including counter terrorism, Left-Wing Extremism, cybercrime, economic security, immigration, coastal security and narco-trafficking. Deliberations were also held on emerging security concerns along the border with Bangladesh and Myanmar, and trends in urban policing. Further, a review was undertaken of implementation of the newly enacted criminal laws, initiatives and best practices in policing as also the security situation in the neighbourhood.","PM Narendra Modi called upon the police forces of the country to adopt the'SMART policing mantra' The 'SMART' acronym expanded to ""strategic, meticulous, adaptable, reliable and transparent"" Modi expressed concern at the threats generated on account of digital frauds, cybercrimes and AI.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115875843,imgsize-34868,width-400,resizemode-4/115875843.jpg"

MUMBAI: Supreme Court stayed BMC's demolition of an unauthorised construction in Vakola, a day after the municipality assured Bombay high court that the ""offending"" structure would be demolished within a week.Justices Vikram Nath and Prasanna Varale of SC took up the hearing on Thursday 3.55pm and noted that in a contempt petition, ""some order was passed yesterday...apparently, permitting BMC to demolish the first floor of the building in respect to which the status quo order is operating"". Senior advocate D S Naidu, citing urgency, said HC's order, ""pursuant to which the demolition has started today, has not been uploaded as of now"". He showed photographs of the civic body's demolition squad at the site. ""If the demolition exercise is still going on, the same shall be stopped forthwith,"" the SC judges directed.They issued a notice to BMC, posted the hearing on Dec 5 and sought a report from HC registrar general ""with regard to uploading of the [HC] order...""The special leave petition was filed in SC by Rajendra Gomai and family, occupants of the 4,500 sq ft property, which has structures on it. In March 2016, L civic ward office issued a notice to Gomais to remove the unauthorised structures. They moved HC, which in May 2016, directed a status quo to be maintained - it was continued from time to time. In 2019, BMC filed a contempt petition that HC's status quo order was violated by further illegal construction on the site, and in July 2018, it issued a stop-work notice.Before the bench of Justices Ajay Gadkari and Kamal Khata on Wednesday, Gomais' advocates Rajesh Kachare and Sachin Shetye said the status quo order was in respect of the first floor and further construction on the ground floor was not affected by it. But the judges rejected the submission, stating that by ""misreading and misrepresenting"" the May 2016 order, Gomais carried out further illegal construction and ""this...is clearly taking advantage of the status quo order...which is unconscionable."" They noted Kachare failed to produce BMC permission when asked for. ""...the respondents have certainly attempted to take the judicial system for a ride and for granted...It is one of the rare cases where the Corporation has initiated contempt proceedings...,"" the judges said.They further noted that BMC records revealed illegal construction of approximately 5,000 sq ft on the first floor as per the March 2016 notice, and 900 sq ft on the ground floor as per the July 2018 stop-work notice. Also, in their reply-affidavit, the Gomais had not proven existence/permissions prior to the datum line or as a tolerated structure, and as per their records, it is a residential structure.The HC judges, from BMC officers' ""uncertain and unacceptable"" answers, said they were led to ""draw an inference that the officers... are in cahoots with respondents and/or more interested in protecting the illegal structure than its demolition"".","Justices Vikram Nath and Prasanna Varale of SC took up the hearing on Thursday 3.55pm.

However, according to junior external affairs minister Kirti Vardhan Singh, the fast-tracking process involved meeting specific requirements like paying one year's tuition fee in advance, providing a mandatory Guaranteed Investment Certificate (GIC) worth $20,635 as proof of funds, and meeting language proficiency levels.On Nov 8, 2024, Canada ended the SDS programme.

Unpacking India's fuming response at COP29: What really transpired?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/unpacking-indias-fuming-response-at-cop29-what-really-transpired/articleshow/115872889.cms,"NEW DELHI: In the wee hours of November 24, while most people in India were fast asleep, a drama unfolded at a sprawling conference hall of the Olympic stadium in Azerbaijan's capital Baku. Diplomats from nearly 200 countries, civil society representatives and journalists had gathered to witness a decision that could determine the fate of climate action in the Global South. But what transpired was far from routine -- it was a moment of diplomatic brinkmanship that left many stunned and India's delegation fuming.As the president of this year's UN climate conference, Mukhtar Babayev, approached the centrepiece agenda item -- the New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) on climate finance -- India's Deputy Lead Negotiator Neelesh Sah rushed to COP29 Lead Negotiator Yalchin Rafiyev to convey that the country wants to make a statement before the adoption of the contentious decision.Around 2:30 am, without so much as a pause for objections or comments, Babayev hammered the gavel, declaring the USD 300 billion climate-finance package adopted. The move was so swift, it left delegates from many developing countries blinking in disbelief.Avantika Goswami, head of the Climate Change Programme at the Centre for Science and Environment , said it happened ""quite suddenly and unceremoniously"".""We were surprised because the last-known figure on the table -- USD 300 billion -- was far below the latest G77 compromise of USD 500 billion. We also knew that India was preparing to interject in the process. The fact that it was passed before any such objections were raised came as a surprise,"" she said.Journalists witnessing the drama unfold in the plenary room saw the entire Indian delegation leap to their feet, making a timeout gesture. Sah dashed over to Rafiyev, exchanged a few words and returned to his seat, panting.Meanwhile, Babayev passed the microphone to Cuba for a statement, followed by India, Bolivia, Nigeria and Malawi, who spoke on behalf of a group of 45 least-developed countries. In total, 49 countries objected to the deal. In the UNFCCC process, one objection is enough to block a decision.However, India had no intention of blocking the deal and its outburst was about more than just the money.Delivering India's statement, Chandni Raina, Adviser at the Department of Economic Affairs , described the manner in which the deal was adopted as ""unfair"" and ""stage-managed"".Raina was scathing about the new climate-finance package, calling the meagre USD 300 billion a year by 2035 ""too little and too distant"".She labelled the sum ""abysmally poor"", ""paltry"" and an ""optical illusion"" -- a far cry from the USD 1 trillion developing countries need every year to cope with the warming world.Raina flagged three major issues for India in the deal -- paragraphs 8a, 8c and 9 of the agreement.Para 8a: This suggests that the USD 300 billion will come from all sorts of sources -- public, private, bilateral, multilateral -- and not directly as public money from developed to developing countries. Developing countries have long demanded grants or grant-equivalent funding, not loans that pile on debt. Many poorer nations already spend up to 10 per cent of their GDP on servicing debt.Paras 8c and 9: These allow developing countries' contributions -- whether through their funding to multilateral climate finance (MDBs) or their own bilateral climate finance -- to be voluntarily counted towards the USD 300 billion goal. Essentially, Global South countries might end up footing their own climate bills -- hardly the spirit of climate justice.Raina called it a ""deflection"" of developed nations' responsibilities.Questions have been raised as to why India did not mention these issues at the heads-of-delegation meeting on Saturday or earlier.To be clear, India had already articulated its concerns throughout the two-week conference.From high-level dialogues on just transition, pre-2030 ambition, climate finance and adaptation finance to the Mitigation Work Programme and its national statement, India has consistently made its case, aligning with the group of Like-Minded Developing Countries.A former negotiator familiar with the backroom drama told PTI that India's 11th-hour objection was not a tantrum -- it was a plea for fairness.India wanted more discussion, especially since the text -- with actual numbers -- only came out a day before adoption.""India was shown a figure of USD 300 billion in closed-door meetings on Saturday (November 23), but public documents still listed it as USD 250 billion. Understandably, India was nonplussed,"" the former negotiator said.To make matters worse, the COP29 presidency did not share how other countries had reacted to the USD 300 billion figure. India wanted to raise all these points before the decision was finalised, but the presidency did not give it the chance, the former negotiator explained.Another former negotiator pointed out that India's statement in the plenary hinted at its desire for a proper discussion on all these issues.If India and others had spoken before the decision, it might have delayed the agreement. India's actions suggest that it was not trying to derail the deal entirely, the negotiator added.Meanwhile, a civil society member was baffled by how two of the most vulnerable groups to climate change -- the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) -- ended up accepting ""such a bad deal"" after staging a walkout just hours earlier. These groups had demanded USD 220 billion and USD 39 billion respectively from the total finance package.Most experts PTI spoke to believe that the shadow of the US presidential elections played a big role. ""Countries were scared into thinking that next year's deal would be even worse. They felt cornered into accepting this one,"" said the first negotiator.An observer added that Brazil, set to host COP30, wanted to avoid inheriting a mess, while heavyweights like China and Saudi Arabia were busy safeguarding their interests -- they did not want to be officially recognised as climate-finance contributors.As the world turns its focus to the next climate summit in Brazil, one question lingers -- can meaningful progress be made if such critical decisions are seen as skewed against those most vulnerable to climate change?","India's Deputy Lead Negotiator Neelesh Sah rushed to COP29 to convey that the country wants to make a statement before the adoption of the contentious decision. The move was so swift, it left delegates from many developing countries blinking in disbelief. India had no intention of blocking the deal and its outburst was about more than just the money.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115872929,imgsize-826041,width-400,resizemode-4/115872929.jpg"

He suggested that each of the initiatives be collated and implemented entirely in 100 cities of the country. He called for the use of technology to reduce the workload of the constabulary and suggested that the police station be made the focal point for resource allocation.Discussing the success of hackathons in solving some key problems, the Prime Minister suggested deliberating on holding a National Police Hackathon as well. He highlighted the need for expanding the focus on port security and preparing a future plan of action in this regard.Recalling the contribution of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, first home minister of Independent India, to the ministry of home affairs, Modi exhorted the entire security establishment from MHA to the police station level, to pay homage to him on his 150th birth anniversary next year, by resolving to set and achieve a goal on any aspect that stands to improve the police‘s image, professionalism and capabilities. He urged the police forces to modernise and realign themselves with the vision of ‘Viksit Bharat’.During the three-day conference that concluded on Sunday, in-depth discussions were held on existing and emerging challenges to national security , including counter terrorism, Left-wing extremism, cyber crime, economic security, immigration, coastal security and narco-trafficking. Deliberations were also held on emerging security concerns along the border with Bangladesh and Myanmar, trends in urban policing and strategies for countering malicious narratives. Further, a review was undertaken of implementation of newly-enacted major criminal laws, initiatives and best practices in policing as also the security situation in the neighborhood.PM offered valuable insights during the proceedings and laid a roadmap for the future.Among those who were part of the conference were home minister Amit Shah, principal secretary to PM, national security adviser, junior home ministers, MHA brass, and DGPs/IGPs of all states and Union territories, and heads of Central police organisations and para-military forces.

List of unsold player in IPL mega auction

NEW DELHI: The IPL 2025 Mega Auction brought excitement and surprises, but for some seasoned players, it marked an unexpected turn. Notable names like David Warner, Jonny Bairstow, and Kane Williamson , who have been cornerstones in the IPL for years, found themselves without bids.Each had a base price of Rs 2 crore, but despite their immense experience and proven track records, none of them attracted offers. Their absence from the auction table raised questions, particularly given their global stature in T20 cricket. It’s a stark reminder of how the dynamics of the auction can sometimes overshadow established stars in favour of fresh talent.In addition to these marquee international names, other seasoned players like Shardul Thakur Ajinkya Rahane , and Glenn Phillips also went unsold. Rahane, a reliable middle-order batsman, and Thakur, an all-rounder with vast IPL experience, both entered the auction with a base price of Rs 1.5 crore, but failed to secure a contract.Similarly, Phillips, known for his explosive batting and wicketkeeping skills, and Thakur, a consistent bowler, were left out despite being integral parts of their national teams. This reflects the fierce competition in the auction, where franchises appear to be banking on younger, more explosive talent rather than experienced hands.Perhaps the most surprising snub was former U-19 captain Prithvi Shaw , who had once been considered one of India’s brightest young talents. With a modest base price of Rs 75 lakh, Shaw was expected to generate significant interest.However, despite his impressive domestic performances, Shaw failed to attract any buyers. This highlights a growing trend in the IPL, where franchises are increasingly looking for players who can deliver immediate impact, while the burden of expectation weighs heavily on players like Shaw, who have not yet lived up to their early promise.The unsold list also includes several uncapped players, such as Yash Dhull, Kartik Tyagi, and Piyush Chawla, who could have added value to any team. With base prices ranging from Rs 30 lakh to Rs 50 lakh, these players were considered potential investments, but their inability to secure deals underscores the auction's unpredictable nature.As franchises continue to focus on emerging talent from India and abroad, the auction results serve as a reminder that the IPL is not just about star power but also about fitting the right players into the right roles, irrespective of their past achievements.","IPL 2025 Mega Auction brought excitement and surprises, but for some seasoned players, it marked an unexpected turn.

Real reason behind Gronkowski’s absence from Fox NFL Sunday



Rob Gronkowski just might be retarded

Is there tension between Rob Gronkowski and Terry Bradshaw?



Rob Gronkowski ’s absence from Fox NFL Sunday this past week sparked rumors and speculation, especially after a playful jab from co-host Terry Bradshaw . Fans quickly wondered if the two were involved in some sort of on-air fallout. However, the truth behind Gronkowski ’s missing appearance is far simpler than the gossip suggests.Rob Gronkowski, former Patriots star, made headlines when he missed this Sunday’s Fox NFL Sunday broadcast. Speculation quickly swirled—did Terry Bradshaw’s recent jab at Gronk’s on-air analysis play a part in his absence? The two have co-hosted the show for two years, but this week, Gronk wasn’t there.The truth behind Gronkowski’s absence is much simpler and a bit less dramatic. He was actually in New Hampshire on November 24 to honor a commitment with Dick’s Sporting Goods, a date he’d set before the so-called ""beef"" with Bradshaw even happened. So, despite rumors, there was no falling-out or retirement plans at play here.Still, Bradshaw’s comment about Jimmy Johnson filling in for Gronk sparked curiosity. Johnson, who retired from his role last year, was replaced by Gronkowski two years ago, and his name resurfaced after Bradshaw’s November 17 remark about the four-time Super Bowl champion. The speculation about a rift between Bradshaw and Gronk was fueled, but it seems there’s no drama, just a prior commitment for Gronk.So, despite the chatter, Gronkowski’s absence had nothing to do with any tension with his co-host.Also Read: Andy Reid’s Chiefs highlight major TE injury as Travis Kelce struggles against NFL veteran After the Lions' dominant 52-6 victory over the Jaguars on November 17, the Fox NFL Sunday crew shared their thoughts on the game. Rob Gronkowski, a broadcaster for the show since 2022, highlighted how the Lions’ performance reflected Bill Belichick's philosophy of never underestimating an opponent.However, Terry Bradshaw couldn’t resist poking fun at Gronkowski’s analysis.“The guy whose seat you’re sitting in right now, while he’s on vacation” Bradshaw joked, referring to his absence.Gronkowski, slightly nervous, responded,“I’m part of the show, Terry, okay? Where are you going with that?” Bradshaw quickly backtracked, apologizing with, “I apologize Gronk, you know I love you.” (via: EssentiallySports)While the comment may have caught Gronk off guard, it was all in good fun—especially after the 35-year-old legend jokingly confirmed why his 76-year-old co-host sees him as a “part-time” worker due to his commitments to a $16 billion company.","Rob Gronkowski made headlines when he missed this Sunday’s Fox NFL Sunday broadcast.

China’s lone-wolf attacks pose challenge for Xi Jinping’s security state,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/chinas-lone-wolf-attacks-pose-challenge-for-xi-jinpings-security-state/articleshow/115834532.cms,"Xi’s Covid Zero regime exposed the limits of citizens’ tolerance for state overreach.

Eradicating risks

School security

President Xi Jinping has built a sprawling security system to prevent violent forces from destabilizing society. A new wave of deadly attacks is putting pressure on officials to expand that surveillance state.China was stunned this month by its deadliest act of public violence since a string of terrorism strikes rocked the remote Xinjiang region in 2014. Dozens were hospitalized and 35 killed by the bloody car-ramming in Zhuhai city that was the culmination of a spate of violence this year — mostly stabbings — which have sparked nationwide anxiety.Xi responded to spouts of ethnic violence a decade ago by installing a network of facial recognition cameras, tightening Internet controls and expanding a national resident database. Now, the ruling Communist Party is calling on its army of local officials to weed out would-be attackers, drawing on the nation’s troves of big data for that mission.Scattered lone-wolf attacks will likely prove hard to contain, even for the all-seeing Communist Party. The assailants don’t hail from a single group or have a unified cause. While some have pointed to low pay and property woes as their motivation, there’s no quick fix for economic problems leaders have been battling for years.Showing the urgency of the problem, Xi ordered officials up and down the nation to prevent such violence shortly after the Zhuhai attack. “Resolve conflicts and disputes in a timely manner,” he instructed apparatchiks. “Strictly prevent extreme cases, and do your best to protect the lives of the people and social stability.”For decades, Chinese leaders have held their grip on power through an unspoken grand bargain: Citizens sacrifice some freedoms in exchange for security and prosperity. The recent fatal outbursts come as officials also struggle to deliver greater wealth, with the economy battling its longest deflationary streak since 1999 and a yearslong property crisis wiping billions of dollars off households’ books.While the Chinese government has spent years pointing to mass violence in America as proof of the inferior US system, stepping up domestic surveillance carries its own risks.Xi’s Covid Zero regime — which imposed long quarantines, regular mass testing and strict curbs on movement — exposed the limits of citizens’ tolerance for state overreach. That policy crumbled in late 2022 after nationwide protests that, at times, called for the downfall of the top leader.Chinese society is “fed-up and angry with a bunch of issues,” said Lynette Ong, professor of Chinese politics at the University of Toronto. “Unless the leadership comes to the realization that you need to go to the root cause of the problem — which is letting people release their pressure and anger and having more pressure valves — doing more repression actually will not work.”Chinese officials in recent weeks have rushed to reinforce Xi’s security message. Anti-corruption chief Li Xi told local governments to “take practical measures to consolidate the party’s ruling foundation” by resolving grassroots problems. Graft busters should make that their priority when inspecting villages, he added.Ramping up tech surveillance would require more resources at a time when public finances are tight. Government spending on security — with the bulk coming from indebted localities — only grew by 3.1% last year, the lowest during the Xi era excluding the pandemic, according to China’s latest statistics yearbook.Policymakers are instead focusing fiscal policy on stabilizing the housing crash, and a $1.4 trillion plan to rebalance struggling local governments’ books. Top leaders are now preparing for next month’s Central Economic Work Conference, where they’ll map out economic priorities for 2025 when US President-elect Donald Trump returns to office.One less costly tool officials are leaning on is the “Fengqiao experience:” A Mao Zedong-era surveillance campaign used last century to root out anti-party forces, that Xi has revived in recent years to prevent local disputes and disruptive groups from bubbling up to the national level.Already officials in Dingxi city, in China’s northwest, are conducting visits to the families of those who are deemed to have lost hope in life and displaying abnormal behavior along with paranoia, according to an official police WeChat account. Local leaders will try to educate and counsel the needy, it added.Prosecutors in a Guangdong city have now started prioritizing clearing a backlog of cases related to residents’ unhappiness with the judicial process to prevent frustration from spilling over, according to a person familiar with the issue who asked not to be identified discussing sensitive matters.Authorities will utilize existing technology in their push. Officials should mine the “rich” well of legal data to find people who pose a risk, Yin Bai, secretary-general of the party commission in charge of law enforcement agencies, said in eastern Zhejiang recently. He also advocated for strengthening “data identification, screening, analysis and evaluation” to stop attacks.Schools have emerged as a focus, with several attacks this year targeting students. Police officers have been enlisted to oversee school opening and closing hours in the southern province of Guangdong, according to a person familiar with the arrangement, who requested anonymity.In Beijing, where a slashing incident near a primary school injured three children last month, another school has increased its number of guards and armed them with new anti-riot steel forks and batons, according to a person familiar with that set-up.A kindergarten in Shanghai that previously allowed parents to walk their children to the classroom stopped that arrangement this month, citing “multiple vicious incidents that happened consecutively” and a need to “implement instructions from the higher authorities about school safety,” according to a notice seen by Bloomberg.For a nation where violent outbursts are considered rare, such measures are a significant departure. But to many residents, the extra precautions suddenly seem necessary.“I hope that the overall security of the school could be ramped up more,” said Vikki Shu, a 40-year-old mother in Shanghai. “When the economy is not stable, there are a lot of crazy people.”","Xi responded to spouts of ethnic violence a decade ago by installing a network of facial recognition cameras, tightening Internet controls and expanding a national resident database.

""I will personally mention that I have no idea what that’s [like],"" Travis laughed and said.""Try role play one night, you know, see if she's up for that,"" the American Football star said. ""Go to Spencer's novelty and sex-toy store and get some f**king sex stuff, man. Get some rose petals, try and be a little romantic. Maybe you just gotta rekindle that flame.” Radar Online reports that Taylor Swift is not satisfied with her beau's attempt to comfort his fans. ""Word is, she was appalled by his comments,"" an insider told the outlet. ""She was already tiring of his potty mouth, and now this.""There's no doubt it's caused major strain in the relationship.
