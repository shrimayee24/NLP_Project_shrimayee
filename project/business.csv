NEW DELHI: Opposition INDIA bloc , including the Congress, DMK and communist parties, have called for a(strike) in Puducherry on Wednesday.The dawn-to-duskhas been called to protest against the rise in power tariff by the AINRC-BJP-led coalition government in the Union territory.The opposition has claimed that the government's move to introduce pre-paid meters for power supply and privatise power distribution would cripple the farmers of the fair supply of electricity.Congress's Puducherry unit chief V Vaithilingam , who also happens to be Puducherry Lok Sabha MP , has sought the cooperation of all sections of the people for the successful conduct of Wednesday's bandh.The opposition has claimed that privatisation of power distribution would lead the private players to charge an unfair amount and hold consumers to ransom with much-hiked prices.The INDIA bloc stated that there was no inconvenience now when the Department of Electricity is supplying the power. All department assets would be placed at the disposal of the private sector if the power supply becomes the prerogative of the private entrepreneurs, reported news agency PTI.Earlier, speaking at a similar protest organised by the INDIA bloc, DMK's R Siva regretted that the AINRC-BJP coalition government had failed to learn its lesson from the Lok Sabha defeat.Puducherry's former chief minister and senior Congress leader V Narayanasamy has also warned that the INDIA alliance would hold a series of protests if the government refuses to withdraw the hike in power tariff and dropped its proposal to privatise the electricity department.In view of the protest, classes will be suspended today (Wednesday) for standards 1 to 8 in all government and private schools in the Puducherry region. However, Classes 9 to 12 will function as usual, reported news agency ANI.",The dawn-to-dusk has been called to protest against the rise in power tariff by the AINRC-BJP-led coalition government.

: Camps to be set up from this week

NEW DELHI: In a move that will simplify the transfer of ownership rights of agricultural land in 174-plus 'declared urban villages', lieutenant governor V K Saxena announced Tuesday the opening of mutation on the basis of inheritance. He said the decision will impact lakhs of residents who had been denied this natural right from 2010.""I have been frequently visiting villages of the Capital and repeatedly received demands from every single village.Several civic society organisations had requested the opening of the process for mutation... A delegation of seven MPs from Delhi too had given a representation,"" Saxena said at a DDA event in Mangolpuri industrial area. ""From Tuesday, mutation of agricultural land in the urbanised villages of Delhi on the basis of inheritance has begun by revenue authorities as it used to be done earlier.""To roll out the process, camps will be set up in villages from this week, starting with 12 villages on Friday. An official said no amendment will be required in Delhi Development Act to implement the process.The 174-odd villages were declared urbanised from 2017 onwards. However, the process of transferring the title or ownership of the land to family members was stopped as the villages were urbanised and transferred to DDA. Officials argued that post-urbanisation, the Delhi Land Revenue Act, under which mutation is done, was no longer applicable to them.Bhupinder Bazad , president of the master plan committee of Delhi Dehat Vikas Manch, welcomed the decision. ""We were holding protests at two places in Delhi, including Daulatpur village, and allowing mutation was among other prominent demands. Our demand also included implementing master plan 2041,"" said Bazad.The LG also laid the foundation for supplying PNG to 21 villages, laid the foundation stone for 41 new projects, and inaugurated seven projects spread across 18 villages of northwest Delhi under the Dilli Gramodaya Abhiyan (DGA). The ' NaMo Drone Didi Scheme ' was also launched to empower women and help them earn livelihood for their families.To date, 573 projects worth Rs 523 crore have been sanctioned under the DGA scheme, with funds of about Rs 960 crore transferred to DDA for development works in various villages. Of these, 89 are being executed by DDA. While DDA is the nodal agency, it is working in sync with various civic agencies like the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) and Irrigation and Flood Control.The developmental works launched on Tuesday will cover villages across northwest Delhi, under the subdivisions of Kanjhawala, Rohini, and Saraswati Vihar. Projects to be taken up include renovation, repair, and upgrade of chaupals, public buildings, baarat ghar, community halls, roads, lanes and drain improvement works, and repair and renovation of cremation grounds.","Lieutenant governor V K Saxena announced Tuesday the opening of mutation on the basis of inheritance.

Development, Welfare Atishi's Priorities

NEW DELHI: The frontrunner was the chosen one. In an expected turn of events, the AAP legislative party on Tuesday elected finance and education minister Atishi , 43, as its leader, paving the way for her to become the eighth chief minister of Delhi.Outgoing Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal later met lieutenant governor VK Saxena at Raj Niwas along with his council of ministers - Atishi, Gopal Rai, Kailash Gahlot, Saurabh Bharadwaj and Imran Hussain - to submit his resignation.Chief minister -designate Atishi then submitted a letter to stake her claim to form govt. She will remain at the helm for a maximum of five months in this term if the assembly polls are held as per schedule in Feb 2025.""Now, Atishi steps up to lead Delhi till the upcoming elections, carrying the weight of both CM Arvind Kejriwal's vision and the national capital's future,"" said AAP in a statement.AAP functionaries said an assembly session will be convened on Sept 26 and 27, and the new govt under Atishi will prove its majority. This is a mere formality, considering AAP's brute majority of 59 legislators in a 70-member House. Three MLAs have resigned from AAP in the past five months.Leaving Raj Niwas, Atishi told reporters: ""Had it been any other CM, he would have immediately sat on the CM's chair after coming out of jail. No one in the world would have taken a decision like Kejriwal ji (to step down).""""This is an emotional moment for the party and the people of Delhi. At the same time, the people of Delhi have resolved to make Arvind Kejriwal chief minister again. Till elections are held, I will be looking after Delhi,"" she added.Atishi will be the second youngest to become the CM after Chaudhary Brahm Prakash (1952-55) who was just shy of 34 when he was sworn in as CM. She will also be the third woman chief minister of the capital.Her name was proposed by Kejriwal at the meeting of the legislative party, which was held at his camp office at Flag Staff Road. It was unanimously accepted by all legislators.Kejriwal had on Monday held one-on-one meetings with members of AAP's political affairs committee, including all ministers, to seek their view on prospective successors.Kejriwal had announced his decision to step down on Sunday, in less than 48 hours of his release from Tihar Jail after getting bail in the excise policy case. He had told party workers that he would sit in the CM's chair only after obtaining a ""certificate of honesty"" from the electorate in the upcoming polls. He had ruled out deputy CM Manish Sisodia , who was also in jail for over 17 months in the same case, taking over from him. Kejriwal had also urged Election Commission of India to hold elections in Delhi in Nov.A first-time MLA from Kalkaji, Atishi forayed into electoral politics in 2019 when she unsuccessfully contested against BJP's Gautam Gambhir. In 2020, she contested the assembly polls from Kalkaji and won. She was inducted into the cabinet only after Sisodia and former health minister Saytendar Jain resigned due to their incarceration in separate cases.She was initially given six departments which later ballooned to 13. While Kejriwal, even during his first stint of 49 days and 2015 onwards, never kept any portfolio with himself, Atishi is likely to hold on to some departments.Officials said the LG will forward Kejriwal's resignation and Atishi's claim for forming govt to the President and to the Union ministry of home affairs. Once the approvals are received, Raj Niwas will invite her to take the oath of office.Speaking to reporters, AAP's Delhi convenor Gopal Rai had earlier announced that Atishi had been nominated leader of the legislative party. ""At the meeting, it was unanimously decided that till the next elections, which we want to be held in Oct-Nov, when people make Arvind Kejriwal Delhi CM again with a thumping majority, Atishi will carry out the responsibilities as the new CM,"" Rai said.He added that during her stint as CM, Atishi will have two important responsibilities. ""She will ensure that the development work in Delhi is not stopped despite BJP's opposition and also that all welfare schemes of AAP govt, such as free electricity, water and pilgrimage for senior citizens, continue,"" Rai added.Party functionaries were stressing throughout the day that Atishi as CM was an interim arrangement and that after the polls (if AAP wins), Kejriwal will take charge.Kejriwal did not speak to the media or issue any statement after her resignation. Reposting Sisodia's post on X, Kejriwal wrote, ""All the best to Atishi"" in Hindi.In his post on X, Sisodia said PM Narendra Modi had hatched a dirty political conspiracy and made false allegations against Kejriwal and other AAP functionaries, questioned their integrity, sent them to jail and tried to topple the govt.""Arvind Kejriwal has courageously resigned from the post of CM and announced he will go to the court of people. Today, Atishi has been given the responsibility of the CM of Delhi till the elections,"" Sisodia said on X.","Finance and education minister Atishi will become the eighth chief minister of Delhi. She will remain at the helm for a maximum of five months in this term if the assembly polls are held as per schedule in Feb 2025.

The reactor is expected to go into operation in Dec, according to information from several sources.Referring to capacity addition, Mohanty told the delegates that the Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL) has begun commercial operation of two units of the indigenous 700MW pressurized heavy water reactors (PHWRs) at Kakrapar Atomic Power Station in Gujarat in the last one year.“Also, initial fuel loading is complete in another unit of 700MW PHWR at Rajasthan Atomic Power Station,” he said, adding that towards strengthening the fuel supply chain, a green field nuclear fuel complex at Kota in Rajasthan has now entered an advanced commissioning stage, which will mainly cater to the requirement of the forthcoming fleet of indigenously built PHWRs.“As India sets its path to establish itself as a developed nation (Viksit Bharat), the govt of India envisages a significantly greater role for nuclear energy in the next two decades to meet the dual challenges of energy security and balancing climate goals,” Mohanty said.In pursuit of this goal, the govt recently said it will partner with the private sector in developing and setting up compact nuclear reactors — Bharat Small Reactors — which will generate electricity on a smaller scale and have the advantage of being set up faster and be cost-effective, too.Mohanty told the conference that the Heavy Water Board (HWB) is exporting heavy water to several countries for non-power applications, including medical applications and healthcare.“At the dawn of the new era of nuclear renaissance, India stands ready to partner with the agency (IAEA) and other like-minded member states to harness the potential of nuclear energy and contribute to a future defined by growth, innovation, and energy security,” Mohanty said.","India’s first 500MW Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor (PFBR) near Kalpakkam, close to Chennai, set to become critical.

The US Federal Reserve is expected to announce its first interest rate cut in over four years on Wednesday after the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting scheduled on September 17-18. Earlier, top Fed officials including chair Jerome Powell have signaled that a rate cut is imminent, as inflation moves closer to the bank's long-term goal of two percent.The debate among policymakers during their meetings on Tuesday and Wednesday will likely be whether to lower rates by 25 or 50 basis points. Experts believe that the smaller cut is the more prudent choice.""We expect the Fed to cut by 25bp (basis points),"" economists at Bank of America wrote in a recent note to clients. ""The Fed likes predictability. It's good for markets, good for consumers, good for workers,"" said Modestino from Northeastern.""So a 25 basis point cut now, followed up by another 25 basis point cut in November after the next round of economic data, offers a somewhat smoother glide path for the economy,"" Modestino added.The Fed Chair Jerome Powell will announce the outcome of the FOMC meet on Wednesday, September 18 around 11:30 PM Indian Standard Time (IST).The Federal Reserve is anticipated to implement a series of interest rate reductions in the upcoming meetings, according to economists from various banks. While some, such as those at Goldman Sachs, predict a total cut of 75 basis points spread across the final three meetings of the year, others, like the economists at Citi, have a more aggressive outlook, with their base case involving 125 basis points of easing.Traders also expect a probability exceeding 99 percent to the occurrence of at least four additional rate cuts in 2025. These cuts would result in the Fed's key lending rate falling to a range between 3.5 and 3.75 percent, representing a decrease of 175 basis points from the current levels.This will be the Fed's first rate cut since March 2020, when it drastically reduced rates to near-zero to bolster the US economy during the Covid-19 pandemic.The Fed began increasing rates in 2022 in response to a sharp increase in inflation, primarily caused by post-pandemic supply shortages and the conflict in Ukraine. Since then, it has maintained its key lending rate at a 20-year high of between 5.25 and 5.50 percent for the last 14 months, awaiting improvements in economic conditions.",The US Federal Reserve is expected to announce its first interest rate cut in over four years on Wednesday.

Netflix stated in a statement, ""Squid Game was created and written by Hwang Dong-hyuk, and we intend to defend this matter vigorously."" Both parties insist that any resemblance between the two works is purely coincidental and that Squid Game is an entirely original creation.

Indian filmmaker Soham Shah has filed a lawsuit against Netflix and Hwang Dong-hyuk , the creator of the hit series Squid Game , alleging plagiarism. Shah claims that the central concept of a deadly competition with a growing jackpot, featured in Squid Game, was first portrayed in his 2009 film Luck.According to Shah, Luck revolves around a group of people competing in life-threatening games, with the prize money increasing as participants die.He argues that this plotline is strikingly similar to Squid Game, where financially desperate individuals engage in dangerous games with deadly consequences. Shah's legal team emphasizes that this similarity is not a mere coincidence but rather evidence of plagiarism.Shah asserts that he conceived the story for Luck around 2006, and the film was subsequently released globally in July 2009. He further notes that Hwang Dong-hyuk, the creator of Squid Game, has stated that he began working on the script for his series in the same year, 2009.Netflix and Hwang Dong-hyuk have vehemently denied the accusations.Hwang has previously mentioned that he began developing the script for Squid Game in 2009, the same year Luck was released. However, Netflix maintains that this timeline does not support Shah's claims of plagiarism.The lawsuit has sparked a legal battle between the two parties. The outcome of the case will determine whether Shah's allegations hold merit and if Squid Game was indeed influenced by his film Luck.","Indian filmmaker Soham Shah has filed a lawsuit against Netflix and Hwang Dong- hyuk.

Chief minister Pramod Sawant on Tuesday instructed panchayats and municipalities to conduct a special campaign to gather scrap materials , including discarded clothes and waste paper from every household within their jurisdiction.At the launch of the state-level ‘ Swachhata Hi Seva ’ campaign in Panaji, Sawant said that the revenue earned from this effort should be given to labourers.Sawant directed the directorate of urban development as well as the directorate of panchayats to ensure that every rural and urban body participates in this drive. The chief minister said that the goal was to encourage citizens to dispose of unwanted items responsibly and contribute to a cleaner environment. “The collected scrap material should be sent to waste treatment plants or anyone who is handling the waste in a scientific manner. No waste should be dumped along the roads. The revenue earned from this should be given to labourers who are engaged in collecting the scrap items,” Sawant said.Sawant said that a circular has been issued to govt departments, granting authority to the respective ‘head of office’ to dispose of scrap materials valued at Rs 5 lakh or less. For materials worth more than Rs 5 lakh, formal approvals from heads of department would be needed, he said. Panchayat minister Mauvin Godinho said that govt will soon take required steps and introduce provisions within existing laws to penalise individuals who deliberately litter in public places.“We will ensure that even lower-level officers at panchayats are authorised to impose fines,” he said. He directed panchayats to collect garbage tax from every household and even suggested panchayats deny income and other certificates to individuals who fail to pay taxes.Godinho urged local bodies to avail funds from govt and set up ‘wealth out of waste’ plants within their jurisdiction.",Chief minister Pramod Sawant on Tuesday instructed panchayats and municipalities to conduct a special campaign to gather scrap materials.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.",Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "".

This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

Dhaka on Hasina's stay in Delhi: 'Everything doesn't go by law',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/dhaka-on-hasinas-stay-in-delhi-everything-doesnt-go-by-law/articleshow/113440315.cms,"Army gets magistracy power

DHAKA: Bangladesh's interim govt said on Tuesday that former PM Sheikh Hasina was ""staying"" in India as the neighbouring country's govt ""has given her shelter"" after her departure from Dhaka. ""We will have to see this matter this way. Everything does not go by the law,"" Bangladesh foreign affairs adviser Mohammed Touhid Hossain said.The foreign adviser's remarks came while responding to a question on her status in India as her diplomatic passport has been cancelled.He said Bangladesh does not know anything officially from the Indian side except what external affairs minister S Jaishankar said after she went to India.It has been over a month since Hasina landed at a military base near Delhi after a dramatic exit from her country on Aug 5. She was expected to stay in India for just a short period but reports say her attempts to seek asylum in the UK, US and UAE have not been successful so far, according to the BBC.Due to slow progress in the law and order situation in Bangladesh, the interim govt has given magistracy powers to commissioned officers of the Bangladesh army , reports AKM Moinuddin. The public administration ministry issued an official order in this regard on Tuesday night. The decision, effective immediately, will remain in force for the next two months (60 days) and will see these officers acting as executive magistrates.","Bangladesh's interim govt said on Tuesday that former PM Sheikh Hasina was ""staying"" in India as the neighbouring country's govt ""has given her shelter"" It has been over a month since Hasina landed at a military base near Delhi after a dramatic exit from her country on Aug 5.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113440351,imgsize-2073783,width-400,resizemode-4/113440351.jpg"

'He could actually be older'

A popular tourist attraction

Jonathan , born in 1832, holds the title of the world’s oldest living land animal . As of 2024, Jonathan, a Seychelles giant tortoise , is estimated to be 191 years old.Jonathan lives at the governor’s residence on the island of Saint Helena in the South Atlantic Ocean. He was brought to Saint Helena in 1882 and has since become a beloved figure there.Veterinarian Joe Hollins , who has cared for Jonathan and three other tortoises on Saint Helena since 2009, celebrates Jonathan's birthday each year on New Year’s Day.Although the governor of Saint Helena, Nigel Phillips, has unofficially assigned Jonathan a hatch date of December 4, 1832, Hollins prefers to celebrate on New Year’s Day, honoring Jonathan’s age rather than his exact birthdate. On his birthday, Jonathan typically spends his day slowly roaming in search of fresh clover and taking an afternoon nap, according to Hollins.Jonathan’s diet consists of various vegetation, including grasses, leaves, and fruits, which are essential for his health and longevity. His caretakers ensure he receives a balanced diet.Weighing approximately 200 kg and measuring about 1.2 meters in length, Jonathan remains in relatively good health despite his age. He spends his days basking in the sun, eating grass and leaves, and interacting with visitors. His remarkable longevity has made him a popular tourist attraction.Though Jonathan is blind and lacks a sense of smell, he still has excellent hearing.According to Hollins, Jonathan’s age could be even greater than recorded.Historical records show Jonathan grazing the governor’s mansion grounds between 1882 and 1886. A letter mentions that he was fully grown when he arrived from the Seychelles Islands in 1882, meaning he was at least 50 years old at that time. Hollins highlights Jonathan’s historical significance, noting that he was around 50 years old when the incandescent lightbulb was invented. During his lifetime, Jonathan has seen 31 governors come and go.Jonathan has exceeded the average life expectancy of 150 years for a land tortoise. As he has entered his 92nd year, Hollins remains hopeful that Jonathan will continue to greet visitors well into his third century.Hollins shares a deep affection for Jonathan, calling it a privilege to care for him. When Hollins first arrived, Jonathan had health issues, including cataracts and a deteriorating beak. Hollins introduced fresh fruits and vegetables into Jonathan’s diet, which significantly improved his health.Jonathan has become a major attraction on Saint Helena, drawing around 1,500 tourists annually. Due to high visitor interest, a tortoise corridor was introduced to allow tourists to view Jonathan without disturbing him.“He loves the chatter and interaction,” said Hollins, as quoted by The Washington Post, noting that Jonathan also enjoys the sounds from a nearby tennis court.“Whatever happens, I think we can be satisfied that we’ve done our best for him,” Hollins said, expressing his hope to be present for Jonathan’s 200th birthday celebration.","Jonathan, a Seychelles giant tortoise, is estimated to be 191 years old.
