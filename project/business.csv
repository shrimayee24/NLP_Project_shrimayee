India’s ‘fast track immigration-trusted traveller programme’ sees 60% faster clearance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indias-fast-track-immigration-trusted-traveller-programme-sees-60-faster-clearance/articleshow/113475377.cms,"NEW DELHI: The ‘fast track immigration-trusted traveller programme’ (FTI-TTP) launched by the Union home minister Amit Shah in June to facilitate pre-verified flyers resulted in 60% faster immigration clearance for the 1,500 Indians and overseas citizens of India (OCIs) who availed of the facility, a senior home ministry official said while sharing that 18,400 individuals had enrolled in the programme so far.Briefing reporters about initiatives taken by the ministry of home affairs in the first 100 days of Narendra Modi government, a senior officer said that between the rollout of the three new criminal laws on July 1 and September 3, 5.56 lakh first information reports (FIRs) were registered under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita. As many as 8 lakh officers were trained in the new laws by the Bureau of Police Research and Development, NCRB, National Forensic Sciences University, National Informatics Centre and the states/Union territories. In addition, ‘NCRB’s sankalan of criminal laws’, a mobile and web application to help users navigate the new laws, was downloaded 5.85 lakh times.The official said the emergency response support system (ERSS) — accessible to citizens through ‘112’ helpline — has been updated to ERSS 2.0, which is now fully functional in 6 states and Union territories. “Over 38.3 crore calls had been received by emergency response centres between the launch of 112 services across India, and July 31, 2023, and ‘112 India’ mobile app downloaded over 25 lakh times,” shared the officer.The official said that with a March 2026 deadline set for ending Left-wing extremism (LWE), the security vacuum was being filled with intelligence-based operations, along with expediting investigation and prosecution of cases relating to LWE violence. He said the Chhattisgarh government will soon bring a new surrender policy that will offer attractive incentives to youths to give up arms and join the mainstream.On the trusted traveller programme — launched via a pilot project at Delhi’s IGI to allow enrolled flyers to complete immigration by passing through e-gates or automated border gates, after screening based on facial recognition — the officer said it will now be extended to other international airports in Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Kochi and Ahmedabad. As of now the programme covers only Indian nationals and overseas citizens of India, who can sign up on a gratis basis, but shall eventually be extended to foreign nationals.Asked about concerns regarding data leaks, given that FTI-TTP uses facial recognition, the officer said adequate safeguards were built in to guard privacy and secure the database.“Due to the heavy passenger volume at key international airports, particularly when multiple flights land over a short time, congestion and long queues are witnessed. The FTI-TTP expedites immigration clearance without compromising security. The programme not only benefits those enrolled under the scheme but also others as the overall wait time at immigration counters decreases,” said the officer.On the fight against cybercrime, the official said 5,000 cyber commandos are to be trained over a 5-year period to assist the Central agencies and state/UT police in securing digital space.Talking about the launch of Mental Health and Normalcy Augmentation System (MANAS) helpline, the officer said the anti-narcotics task forces of state police will soon be integrated with it. He said the helpline has so far offered 12,985 citizens assistance in drug-related matters, deaddiction guidance and rehabilitation information.","The ‘fast track immigration-trusted traveller programme’ (FTI-TTP) launched by the Union home minister Amit Shah in June resulted in 60% faster immigration clearance for the 1,500 Indians and overseas citizens of India (OCIs) who availed of the facility.

Helping beggars talk business,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/helping-beggars-talk-business/articleshow/113474223.cms,"Wishes may or may not be horses, but what’s stopping beggars from becoming entrepreneurs ? They may not have money to make ends meet, but why can’t they seek investment instead of alms? These are the sort of seemingly impossible questions that Chandra Mishra has answered convincingly with Beggars Corporation . The backdrop to this story is provided by UP’s Varanasi.Chandra, 60, belongs to Odisha and is a former journalist who has also worked with various state govts on employment policies.His first brainwave came in mid-2020, when he was in Varanasi to conduct a survey on job losses due to the Covid pandemic. By the end of the year, he was back in the holy city with a long-term plan.Swarmed by kids pleading for a handout on Varanasi’s many ghats, Chandra and two of his friends decided they’d start a school for them. It eventually evolved into the ‘ School of Life ’ for children of beggars. Alongside, the trio came up with the idea of Beggars Corporation.Chandra partnered with a local NGO to provide job opportunities to beggars in Varanasi. There were no takers in the beginning, but the dwindling footfall of pilgrims during the lockdown meant begging was hardly viable for put ting food on the plate. Many beggars began to approach Chandra. Rajni was one of them. He started training her to make bags.Rajni was a quick learner and soon shot to fame. “There was no looking back for Rajni once her labour bore fruit. The change had set in. A beggar had been transformed into a worker,” said Chandra. Rajni brought in 12 others and Chandra and his partners Badrinath Mishra and Devendra Thapa registered Beggars Corporation as a for-profit company in Aug 2022.Soon, their first product line, called ‘ Bagful of Dreams ’, was launched. Before long, they diversified into another range called the ‘Enchanted Shirt’, featuring patchwork clothing made from upcycled Banarasi silk and cotton waste. Stoles, curtains, wall-hangings, cushion sets and even sheets followed on demand. Starting with an investment of Rs 5.7 lakh sourced from various people in the first year, the endeavour grew gradually. “These beggars have returned whatever amount was invested in them,” Chandra says. In the corporation’s lingo, they are known as beggar-turned-entrepreneurs (BTE ).Scaling up in 2023-24, the organisation reached out to over 50 beggar families. By 2024, over 2,000 people from different walks of life got associated with the corporation and its annual turnover reached Rs 3.4 crore. It’s looking to do business of Rs 15 crore in 2024-25.In April 2023, Beggars Corporation received the Best Social Impact Award in a contest held in collaboration with Startup India.","Chandra Mishra, 60, is the founder of Beggars Corporation in Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh.

Yacht Club of Hyderabad

has trained about 900 students who have bagged national and international laurels. It also funds the students’ education, nutrition and healthcare expenses

How about tonight?” asked an official from Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority when Suheim Sheikh approached them for access to the Hussain Sagar lake in Hyderabad for setting up a yacht club.When the officer asked Sheikh, now 60, when he needed permission, the former techie jokingly replied, “How about tomorrow?” Without even looking up from the file, the officer shot back, “How about tonight?”. And just like that Sheikh’s dream yacht club became a reality.That was way back in 2009. But if the term yacht club has triggered an image of an elite haunt, with men in dapper suits and women in designer gowns lazing on the deck of fancy boats, think again. Sheikh’s sailors are children whose parents earn less than Rs 20,000 a month, he says. Started with the motive of bringing ‘dignity through sports’, Sheikh has been working for the development of underprivileged children since, by teaching them sailing and supporting their education.His students have done him proud, bringing home 17 international and 157 national medals over the years. Many of the IIT graduate’s mentees have gone on to win medals within six months or a year of joining the club.“Sailing has always been for elitists. I wanted to bring it within the reach of poor children,” says Sheikh. Talking about how he came up with the idea of the yacht club, Sheikh, himself a sailor, says he noticed there was little representation from the city at sailing tournaments. “I have been sailing for 45 years now. When I used to take part in tournaments in the past, I would notice that hardly anyone from Hyderabad or even Telangana (then part of the undivided Andhra Pradesh) was competing,” says Sheikh, who learnt sailing at the Secunderabad Club in the city and participated in national and international tournaments, winning bronze and silver medals in laser standard sailing at the national level. “For 25 years or more, there was no child under the age of 15 representing the state,” he says. “So, it was always in the back of my mind to change this as the sport has always been in the hands of the elite.”Since its inception, The Yacht Club of Hyderabad has trained about 900 children. Classes are free with Sheikh spending anywhere between Rs 1 and Rs 3 lakh per year per child on training, nutrition, healthcare, education, etc. While most of the financial needs of the club are met through Sheikh’s savings — he was in software before giving up that career to pursue his passion for sailing — his close friends also chip in whenever needed. Post 2018, he also got support from a few corporates. He is now planning to accept CSR funds so that more children can be taken under his wings.A 360-Degree TurnWith 75 yachts, the Yacht Club of Hyderabad currently boasts of “the largest fleet in the country”, and has opened a second branch in the city’s Durgam Cheruvu.During peak sailing season (from June to Sept), the students spend about four hours sailing every day and two hours work ing on their mental and physical fitness. The day starts at 6.30 am and winds up by 8.30 pm. Activities include swimming, rowing, and weight training, while a thirdparty counsellor conducts weekly sessions to work on their mental fitness. During the off-season, children attend fitness training in the morning and sail after school.Along with free sailing lessons and educational support, the children also receive free meals, healthcare, counselling, and leadership and management training.“Expenditure per student depends on the level at which he or she is competing. If they are competing at international tournaments, the club ends up spending about Rs 60 lakh to Rs 70 lakh on one child,” says Sheikh, adding that the club also supports the students’ education till graduation or beyond, in cases where they show interest and promising results.Children as young as eight or nine years are selected from govt schools and orphanages, or even picked up from the streets, through simple fitness tests — running, long jump, push-ups, and sit-ups, among others, and if they show the zeal to learn and excel in sailing. “Currently, we have about 75 students. We want to grow to 300,” says Sheikh, adding that they want to conduct a talent drive across the country to pick more students. “We also want to throw the club open to students from non-marginalised backgrounds,” he adds, who will have to pay for the lessons.Sheikh spends about six months a year actively training students and accompanying them to various national and international championships. The remaining part is dedicated to the development of the club.According to the his students, the club has taught them not just sailing, but how to be successful in life. “Back in 2017, when personnel from the club came to our school and asked who is interested in sailing, I raised my hand assuming I would get to go to a summer camp. But it changed my entire life. I have won about 20 medals, I am studying for a degree at a top college in the city and have just returned from London, where I went as a manager with the sailing team from the club,” says Dharani Laveti, 19, one of the students, adding that right from moving her from a govt school to a private one years back, to sponsoring her education now, the club has taken care of all her needs. Dharani is raised by her single mother, who works in the housekeeping department of a private hospital.Preethi Kongara, 20, another student, who has just returned from Bangkok where she was undergoing training to become a coach, says she wants to become like Sheikh and produce champions in sailing.“From being afraid of water to reaching the Asian Games, my life took a 360-degree turn because of my coach. Now, I’m aiming for a podium finish at the next Asian Games,” says Preethi, who too was raised by a single mother, a housekeeping staffer at a private company.","The Yacht Club of Hyderabad has trained about 900 children.

NEW DELHI: The RG Kar victim 's father requested CBI to secure footage of CCTV cameras focused on the hospital's seminar hall, where the crime took place, as well as those covering all entry and exit points of the hospital, sources told TOI.After CBI shared with SC the letter, the bench said, ""Bearing in mind the genuineness of the concerns, we are of the view that the inputs which have been furnished by the father of the deceased should be duly taken note of by the IO so that appropriate modalities are followed to explore the leads which have been indicated in the letter.""SG Mehta assured the court that CBI would maintain contact with the parents and keep them informed hereafter to assuage their concerns and apprehensions.He also said that certain aspects of the apprehensions expressed in the letter have already been investigated.The father of the deceased also requested the IO to preserve call records of his daughter, who he said was in regular touch with them and even a few hours before she was murdered after being sexually assaulted.He requested CBI to seize the roster duty chart to find out which doctors and healthcare workers were on duty on the night of Aug 9 at RG Kar Hospital along with his daughter.At the end, the father said as parents of the deceased they feel very helpless and anxious even though they have placed faith in the justice system to secure justice for their daughter.KOLKATA: RG Kar Hospital's arrested ex-principal Sandip Ghosh was ""wilfully absent"" from the campus during the crucial period on Aug 9 when he should have been there ""taking necessary steps for preservation of the scene of crime"" till police's arrival to probe a junior doctor's rape-murder, CBI said Wednesday in a submission to a magisterial court, reports Rohit Khanna.Based on his call records, CBInoted that Ghosh had by then spoken to multiple people, including hospital officials and possibly also someone from whom he might have been ""taking orders"".

Govt had refused to hand over even one of these panels. It argued that since Congress as the principal opposition party heads the Public Accounts Committee, which audits all govt expenditure, it need not be given finance.Sources said Trinamool Congress is set to get two committees whereas Samajwadi Party, which is entitled to get one Lok Sabha committee, has agreed to forego its claim, seeking chairmanship of a Rajya Sabha committee to be headed by party's senior neta Ram Gopal Yadav.Sources said that although JDU, one of the key NDA constituents, is not entitled to any panel, it will get one from BJP's quota.There are 24 department-related standing committees (DRSCs).

"Indus Water Treaty: India serves formal notice to Pakistan, seeks modification",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indus-water-treaty-india-serves-formal-notice-to-pakistan-seeks-modification/articleshow/113455222.cms,"What is Indus Water Treaty?

NEW DELHI: India has sent notice to Pakistan seeking changes in crucial Indus Water Treaty . According to news agency PTI sources, the Indian government served a formal notice to Pakistan seeking modification in the treaty.The notice highlighted fundamental changes in circumstances that require review of treaty.India had also sent a notice to Pakistan in January, 2023 seeking amendment to 1960 treaty.The notice was issued due to Pakistan's failure to cooperate in the implementation of the treaty.According to the Indus Waters Treaty signed between India and Pakistan in 1960, ""all the water of the eastern rivers - Sutlej, Beas, and Ravi amounting to around 33 million acre feet (MAF) annually — is allocated to India for unrestricted use."" On the other hand, the majority of the water from the western rivers, namely the Indus, Jhelum, and Chenab, which amounts to approximately 135 MAF annually, has been allocated to Pakistan.Also Read:The treaty grants India the right to generate hydroelectricity through run-of-the-river projects on the western rivers, subject to specific design and operation criteria. Pakistan has the right to raise objections to the design of Indian hydroelectric projects on these rivers. Under the treaty, Pakistan received roughly 80 per cent of the water in the Indus drainage system, while India was allocated about 3.3 crore out of the total 16.8 crore acre-feet of water in the Indus system. Currently, India utilises slightly more than 90 per cent of its allocated share of the Indus waters.India has the right to utilise water resources from the Indus River system in several states, including Ladakh, Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, and Rajasthan. These states also receive water from the Yamuna River, a tributary of the Ganga. Pakistan, on the other hand, heavily relies on the Indus system, particularly in its Punjab province, which is crucial for feeding the rest of the country. Whenever India attempts to use its allocated water quota or construct a dam as permitted under the Indus Waters Treaty, Pakistan raises objections, leading to increased tensions between the two nations.One such example is the Tulbul Navigation Project, which the Indian government decided to expedite following the Uri terror attack. The project, referred to as the Wullar Barrage project by Pakistan, is a long-standing plan that was suspended in 1987 due to objections from Pakistan. According to sources, despite India's repeated efforts to find a mutually acceptable solution, Pakistan refused to discuss the issue during the five meetings of the Permanent Indus Commission held between 2017 and 2022. Recently, at Pakistan's persistent insistence, the World Bank has initiated actions on both the neutral expert and Court of Arbitration processes.Under the Indus Waters Treaty, India has the right to develop 13.4 lakh acres of irrigation in Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh. However, currently, only 6.42 lakh acres of land are irrigated in these Union Territories. Furthermore, the treaty allows India to store 3.60 million acre-feet of water from the western rivers, namely the Jhelum, Indus, and Chenab. To date, there is virtually no storage capacity developed in Jammu and Kashmir. The treaty also permits India to construct run-of-river dams on the Jhelum, Chenab, and Indus without blocking the flow of water. This provision gives India the advantage of temporarily restricting the flow of waters in the rivers allocated to Pakistan under the treaty.","India has served a formal notice to Pakistan seeking modification in the Indus Water Treaty.

Top-notch drone goes down after technical failure off Chennai just ahead of mega deal with the US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/top-notch-drone-goes-down-after-technical-failure-off-chennai-just-ahead-of-mega-deal-with-the-us/articleshow/113467280.cms,"NEW DELHI: A top-notch MQ-9B Sea Guardian drone, an unarmed version leased by the Navy from US firm General Atomics , had to be ditched into the sea off Chennai after it encountered a technical failure on a routine surveillance mission in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) on Wednesday afternoon.The “controlled ditching” of the high-altitude, long-endurance remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) comes just when India is getting set to ink the mega $3.9 billion (over Rs 33,500 crore) deal for 31 weaponized `hunter-killer’ variants of the drone with the US next month, as was earlier reported by TOI.The fighter-sized Sea Guardian operating from naval air base INS Rajali at Arakkonam, near Chennai, encountered the technical failure at about 2 pm. “There is a procedure to do a technical reset of the RPA in flight. It was tried but did not work. It was then navigated to a safe area over the sea and a controlled ditching was carried out,” an officer said.The Navy has sought a detailed report from General Atomics since the company was “operating and maintaining” the two leased Sea Guardians, which are variants of the famous Predator or Reaper drones. India had first got the two RPAs on lease from General Atomics in Sept 2020 and has since extended the lease several times.The two RPAs have flown over 12,000 hours of long-range strategic ISR (intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance) missions in the IOR, with the Navy deciding their tasking and getting all the “feeds” from them. “The drones, along with other assets, have enabled the Navy to keep a close track of Chinese warships and spy vessels operating in the IOR,” another officer said.India has extensively deployed the drones forISR missions even along the 3,488-km Line of Actual Control with China amid the ongoing military confrontation in eastern Ladakh. “The imagery provided by the drones about the activities of the People’s Liberation Army across the LAC convinced national security planners of their operational utility,” he added.The Predators or Reapers do have a proven track record in high-value precision bombings in Afghanistan and other conflicts, though some critics say the drones have largely operated in “uncontested air space” without facing a hostile air force or advanced surface-to-air missile systems.In the proposed govt-to-govt deal with the US, 15 Sea Guardians are earmarked for Navy and 8 Sky Guardians each for Army and IAF, in the backdrop of both China and Pakistan steadily boosting their fleets of armed drones.Designed to fly for almost 40 hours at altitudes over 40,000-feet, the 31 MQ-9B drones will come with 170 Hellfire missiles, 310 GBU-39B precision-guided glide bombs, navigation systems, sensor suites and mobile ground control systems, among other associated equipment.Under the deal, General Atomics will assemble the 31 drones in India, while also making an investment, sourcing almost 35% of the components from Indian companies and setting up an MRO (maintenance, repair, overhaul) facility here.India also plans to equip the drones with indigenous weapons, including the naval short-range anti-ship missiles (NASM-SR) being developed by DRDO , in the future, as was reported by TOI.","A top-notch MQ-9B Sea Guardian drone had to be ditched into the sea off Chennai after it encountered a technical failure on a routine surveillance mission.

"Citing cross-border terrorism, India seeks Indus treaty review",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/citing-cross-border-terrorism-india-seeks-indus-treaty-review/articleshow/113467080.cms,"India has served a notice to Pakistan for a review and modification of the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), calling upon Islamabad to begin negotiations with the Indian government for the same. While India had issued a similar notice for IWT modification last year too, it has cited on this occasion the impact of what official sources called persistent cross-border terrorism as one of the reasons for seeking a review of the World Bank-backed Treaty that has remained invulnerable so far to major and frequent disruptions in bilateral ties.The fresh notice follows the recent terror attacks in Jammu, after which PM Narendra Modi had accused Pakistan of using terrorism and “proxy war” to remain relevant. However, the trigger for first seeking a modification last year was Pakistan’s “intransigence and unilateral actions” on the issue of Kishenganga and Ratle hydroelectric projects in J&K. India has been upset that despite the World Bank asking both countries to find a mutually agreeable way to look into Pakistan's objections to the projects, Islamabad had unilaterally sought a parallel process to address the issue.According to official sources, India’s notification highlights “fundamental and unforeseen changes in circumstances” that require a reassessment of obligations under various Articles of the Treaty. “Among various concerns, important ones include change in population demographics; environmental issues; need to accelerate development of clean energy to meet India’s emission targets and impact of persistent cross border terrorism,” said a source on condition of anonymity.The IWT provides a framework for irrigation and hydropower development, allocating western rivers (Indus, Jhelum, Chenab) to Pakistan and the eastern rivers (Ravi, Beas, Sutlej) to India.As the World Bank says, the Treaty also allows each country certain uses of the rivers allocated to the other.The notice was served to Pakistan on August 30 in line with Article XII(3) of the IWT. Under the Article, according to Indian authorities, the Treaty provisions can be modified by a duly ratified agreement between the 2 governments. The notification disclosure coincided with the first round of voting in the J&K assembly elections.Government sources also said the notification was issued against the backdrop of the prolonged dispute over the Kishenganga and Ratle Hydro Projects. The World Bank in October 2022 appointed not just a neutral expert that India sought to examine the issue but also, at Pakistan's insistence, a Court of Arbitration chairman, despite acknowledging India's concern that carrying out the two processes concurrently posed practical and legal challenges. The Indian side has, therefore, also called for reconsideration of dispute resolution mechanism under the Treaty, said a source. India has not joined the Court of Arbitration meetings, as it believes it was constituted illegally.India had in June this year hosted a delegation from Pakistan on water-related bilateral issues under the IWT, which requires the two sides to meet at least once every year, alternately in India and Pakistan. Indus talks backed by the World Bank have not been affected by the turbulent India-Pakistan relations that have otherwise not seen any substantive bilateral engagement between them in the past 9 years, or since the Pathankot terror attack. Pakistan has invited India to the SCO heads of government meeting it will host next month, raising hopes of a high-level visit from India but the Indian government, which is unlikely to skip the meeting because it’s a multilateral event, is yet to take a call on the level of participation.","India has served a notice to Pakistan for a review and modification of the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) The fresh notice follows the recent terror attacks in Jammu, after which PM Narendra Modi had accused Pakistan of using terrorism and “proxy war” to remain relevant.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113467107,imgsize-36974,width-400,resizemode-4/113467107.jpg"

How will these proposals be implemented?

NEW DELHI: The BJP-led NDA government on Wednesday took another step towards 'one nation, one election' as the Union Cabinet approved the Kovind panel recommendations for simultaneous elections in the country. The panel, headed by former president Ram Nath Kovind , had submitted its report in March this year.Prime Minister Narendra Modi hailed the development calling it an important step towards making India's democracy even more vibrant and participative even as the opposition slammed his government calling the idea impractical and also a cheap stunt.The Kovind panel proposes synchronising elections in two steps. While the first step will integrate Lok Sabha elections and state assemblies' polls, the second step will ensure that elections to municipalities and panchayats are held within 100 days of polls to Lok Sabha and state assemblies.In the past, there have been several occasions when a sizeable number of states have held assembly elections along with the Lok Sabha election. This number was highest in 1967, when as many as 20 state elections were held along with the national elections for Lower House. In 1977, this number was 17 while in 1980 and 1985, it was 14. However, since 1989 the number of states that have held elections simultaneously with Lok Sabha has been in single digits.One of the biggest challenges in implementing 'one nation, one election' is the differing tenures of various state assemblies. Here's a look at how assembly election in states are scheduled from 2024 to 2029, assuming that next Lok Sabha elections will be held in 2029 and all the state governments complete their respective terms.2024: Lok Sabha elections + 6 states, 1 UT2025: 2 states, 1 UT2026: 4 states, 1 UT2027: 6 states2028: 10 statesThe Kovind panel proposes a one-time transitory measure to synchronise all these polls.The transition provisions would come into force from the ""Appointed Date"", which will be the date of the first sitting of Lok Sabha constituted after a general election. The President would by notification issued on ""Appointed Date"" bring into force the provisions for transition.Once the transition provisions are brought into play, the tenure of all state legislative assemblies constituted in any election after the “Appointed date” would come to an end on the expiry of the full term of Lok Sabha, irrespective of when that assembly was constituted. This would result in Lok Sabha and all state legislative assemblies being ready for a simultaneous election at the end of this term.Once synchronisation between the terms of Lok Sabha and state legislative assemblies is achieved, a slew of measures have been proposed by the Kovind Panel to ensure that there is no future disruptions in holding of simultaneous polls. The panel proposes amendments in Constitution to introduce some new concepts and terminologies to ensure synchronisation in future elections.If the Lower House or any state assembly is dissolved sooner than its period of five years from the date appointed for its first meeting, a mid-term election would be held for reconstituting the House or assembly as the case may be. However, the term of the House or the assembly so constituted through a mid-term election, would be for the remaining unexpired period of its term.This will ensure that at the end of five years, the Lok Sabha and all the state assemblies would reach the end of their tenure at the same time, and be ready for the next general election together.In case of any unforseen situation due to which the simultaneous elections to any state assembly cannot be conducted at the time of general elections, the Election Commission of India may make a recommendation to the President, to declare by an Order that the election to that Legislative Assembly may be conducted at a later date. However, the term of such assembly, so constituted, shall end on the same date as the end of the full term of the Lok Sabha.If Lok Sabha is dissolved sooner than the expiry of its full term, fresh elections will be conducted and the next House of the People thus constituted, unless sooner dissolved, shall continue for a period which is equal to the unexpired term of the immediately preceding Lok Sabha.If any legislative assembly is dissolved sooner than the expiry of its full term, fresh elections will be held and a new assembly will be constituted. This new assembly, unless sooner dissolved, shall come to an end with the expiry of full term of Lok Sabha.Mid-term elections to Municipalities and Panchayats will be held for the unexpired period of their term until the next general elections.The Kovind panel has proposed a Constitution Amendment Bill in Parliament to amend Article 83 (Duration of Houses of Parliament) and Article 172 (Duration of State Legislatures) of the Constitution. This Constitution Amendment will not need ratification by the States.Another Constitution Amendment Bill will be introduced for insertion of Article 324A for elections to Municipalities and Panchayats, passed with ratification by the states.Similar amendments will be required to be made in Section 5 (Duration of Legislative Assembly) of the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi Act, 1991 for the Legislative Assembly of Delhi and Section 5 (Duration of Legislative Assembly) of the Government of Union Territories Act, 1963 for the Legislative Assembly of Puducherry. Furthermore, similar amendment will also be required in Section 17 (Duration of Legislative Assembly) of the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019.",Kovind panel proposes synchronising elections in two steps. First step will integrate Lok Sabha elections and state assemblies' polls. Second step will ensure that elections to municipalities and panchayats are held within 100 days of polls to Lok Sabha.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113463802,imgsize-45272,width-400,resizemode-4/113463802.jpg"

Of 17,695 new students, 20% are girls

Seventy-two of top 100 JEE (A) rankers have chosen IIT Bombay , with Delhi following with 23. And in a perfect 10 for the Powai campus, all top 10 rankers have decided to study computer science at the institution. Data shared by IIT Madras at the close of admissions for the 2024-28 batch shows of the top 500, 179 chose IIT-B, 109 Delhi and 69 Madras. While 16 of the top 500 girls arrived in Mumbai, IIT Kharagpur did not get a single top-100 student, reported.MUMBAI: Newcomers to the elite technological club of the country seem to have made a clear choice: 72 of the top 100 JEE (Advanced) rankers have selected the IIT Bombay campus. Another 23 chose IIT Delhi, and two picked IIT Madras.The clamour for computer science at IIT-B among the cream of the lot went up a notch to touch a perfect 10 - all the top 10 all-India rankers in JEE are joining the Powai campus. Twenty-four of the first 25 and 47 of the top 50 followed suit and picked the college over other technology schools at the close of admissions for the 2024-28 batch.Each year, the demand for quality engineering education throws up a disproportionate number of applicants at the computer science department of the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay. A look at the admission forms filled by those who qualified in the JEE (Advanced) 2024 shows that one of two put down computer science at IIT-B as one of their top choices.Data shared by the Indian Institute of Technology Madras shows that of the top 500, 179 chose IIT-B, followed by 109 choosing IIT Delhi, and 69 picking IIT Madras.Last year, 67 of the top 100 got a seat in IIT-B, though computer science at IIT-B was the first choice of 93 of the top 100 rankers. Classes for freshmen have started at the IITs. ""I am proud that IIT Bombay remains the preferred destination for most of the top rankers in the JEE (Advanced) examination,"" IITB director Prof Shireesh Kedare said.On each IIT campus, the top 100 students are considered the icing on the creamy layer. About 30 years ago, IIT Kharagpur was the engineering mecca. The oldest IIT of the country, however, did not receive a single student from the top 100 this year.""While Bombay and Delhi were still building themselves, Kharagpur's students had already occupied top positions in big companies. Students looked at Kharagpur's illustrious alumni and rushed there. Now this has changed,"" a former JEE chairman said.Kanpur ruled the charts after that. A decade ago, admission to IIT-Kanpur ensured demi-god treatment.It is no longer the case. IIT-B alumnus Vishal Misra, vice dean of computing and AI at Columbia Engineering, was recently at the Columbia Global Center Mumbai. Asked why IIT-B is the top choice for many, he said: ""It's the best. As an alum, I have to say that it's the best, for multiple reasons. I think being in Mumbai helps a lot too.""The old Indian Institutes of Technology in the city, Delhi, Chennai and Kanpur have the best gender ratio among all the IIT campuses. This year, 3,480 girls joined various IITs, with 15 girls getting in through the gender-neutral pool of seats, reported.Of the 17,695 students admitted to the 23 IITs, women make up 19.75%. Last year, of the 17,340 admits given out by the IITs, 3,359 were handed out to girls. This year, 42,947 women candidates registered for JEE (Advanced) 2024. Of them, 7,964 candidates made the cut. The southern zone has a disproportionately large share of women. Their journey begins early. Not only have as many bagged a seat, but the proportion of girls - about 15,000 - who register from the southern zone is almost a third of all women aspirants. This zone comprises Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Puducherry. Close to 2,600 from this zone qualified after the entrance exams to join the IITs.Six years after the supernumerary women's quota was intro- duced in the IITs, almost every campus has an average of 19.7% girls. IIT Delhi aims to move towards a 50:50 gender ratio on its campus. ""Women are performing well in all fields of STEM at IIT Delhi. As we are moving towards becoming multi-disciplinary and opening more programmes like design, public policy, we are seeing that a good diverse mix adds so much to the richness of the educational experience,"" IIT Delhi director Rangan Banerjee said. ""While there is already an ecosystem to make everyone comfortable, we want to change the mindset towards science and engineering in a way that our campus' gender ratio is reflec- tive of India's population numbers. We are also making efforts to encourage more women in schools to take up STEM subjects... The ultimate goal is that gender becomes a non-issue,"" he said.","Seventy-two of top 100 JEE (A) rankers have chosen IIT Bombay, with Delhi following with 23.

RBI's policy response

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: The US Federal Reserve reduced interest rates by 50 basis points on Wednesday, marking the first cut in over four years. In its statement, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) said, ""In light of progress on inflation and the balance of risks, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/2 percentage point to 4.75% to 5%.""This move signals the beginning of a policy shift to ease the restrictive conditions previously implemented to control inflation.The Fed's decision will lower the rates at which commercial banks lend to consumers and businesses, reducing the cost of borrowing across a range of financial products, including mortgages, auto loans, and credit cards. This cut is expected to make borrowing more affordable, stimulating spending and investment.The ripple effects of the Fed rate cut will be felt globally, particularly in emerging markets like India.One of the most immediate likely effects of the rate cut is the potential increase in foreign investment in India. When US interest rates are high, investors tend to favor US Treasury securities for their relatively higher returns. However, with a rate cut, yields on these securities will decrease, prompting investors to seek better returns elsewhere, including in Indian equities and debt markets. This shift could lead to a substantial inflow of foreign capital into India, driving up demand for Indian stocks and bonds, which may subsequently increase their prices.The influx of foreign capital is also likely to affect the Indian Rupee (INR). As foreign investors convert their currencies into INR for investment purposes, demand for the rupee will rise, potentially leading to its appreciation against the US dollar. A stronger rupee can have mixed effects; while it may lower the cost of imports (especially crucial commodities like oil), it could also negatively impact Indian exporters by making their goods more expensive for foreign buyers.Globally lower interest rates typically lead to a rally in bond markets . In India, this could mean that existing bonds become more attractive as their yields appear favorable compared to new issues. Consequently, this dynamic may lower borrowing costs for both the government and corporations, encouraging more capital investments and stimulating economic growth .Certain sectors are poised to benefit directly from the Fed's rate cut. For instance, the information technology (IT) sector may see increased demand as US corporations expand their IT budgets due to reduced borrowing costs. Additionally, other sectors such as consumer goods and infrastructure could also experience growth as cheaper financing becomes available.The RBI's response to the Fed's actions will be crucial. Historically, Indian monetary policy has been influenced by US rates. However, RBI governor Shaktikanta Das has already signaled that India is not compelled to follow suit and reduce its own rates.The governor emphasized that maintaining financial stability remains a top priority for the central bank. ""Financial stability is a prime consideration,"" Das said, highlighting the importance of ensuring a robust and resilient financial system.Das's comments suggest that the RBI will carefully assess the domestic economic conditions and potential risks before making any decisions on interest rates.","The ripple effects of the Fed rate cut will be felt globally, particularly in emerging markets like India.

Within that post, Punk discussed an awkward encounter he had with a fan on the way to Portland, Oregon for Raw. According to Punk, the fan had repeatedly asked for an autograph, despite being told no several times. Punk had asked for fans tophrasing quite similar to the words Ethan Page used in his own post about Haliburton.Page may have had some motivation for his lighthearted hit against Punk. By declaring that he will serve as the special guest referee for Page's impending title defense against Trick Williams on the premiere episode of NXT on The CW, CM Punk recently became involved in Page's business on NXT. That episode will take place in Punk's hometown of Chicago, Illinois, which should add to the intrigue. Page's trolling is unlikely to gain him much favor with Punk, and it will be interesting to see whether their lighthearted banter causes any further friction between them.Also read: ""I Heard The Entire Show Just Got Ripped In Half"": WWE Superstar Reflects On His Frustrations With Last-Minute Script Changes During Vince McMahon's Tenure","Ethan Page posted a picture of himself signing an autograph for Tyrese Haliburton.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.",Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
"Yale, Princeton and Duke are questioned over decline in Asian students",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/yale-princeton-and-duke-are-questioned-over-decline-in-asian-students/articleshow/113473858.cms,"The group that successfully sued Harvard to end affirmative action in university admissions last year is now threatening to investigate whether schools are complying with the new rules and to file lawsuits if it believes that they are not. The group, Students for Fair Admissions, has focused on three universities - Princeton , Yale and Duke - where there were notable declines in Asian American enrollment this year compared with last year, which the group said defied expectations.On Tuesday, Students for Fair Admissions sent letters to the schools questioning whether they were complying with rules laid out by the Supreme Court. Princeton, Duke and Yale also saw minor differences in black and Hispanic enrollment in the first class of students admitted since the court struck down race-conscious admissions.The group, a nonprofit that opposes race-based admissions and that represented Asian students in the lawsuit against Harvard, suggested that it was setting itself up as an enforcer of the new rules. ""Based on S.F.F.A.'s extensive experience, your racial numbers are not possible under true neutrality,"" the letters, signed by Edward Blum, the president of Students for Fair Admissions, said.It was one of the first shots across the bow at universities struggling to comply with the court's order while maintaining a diverse student body, and a sign that the fight over race-conscious admissions did not end with the SC's decision. The threatening letters also gave universities - which have been notoriously secretive about their admissions procedures - even more incentive to be opaque.OiYan Poon, a researcher of college admissions systems and the author of a book about the affirmative action debate, said Blum had jumped the gun with his letters. Admissions numbers fluctuate, she said, and one year is too soon to draw conclusions. Among the variables shaping the current numbers is the jump in the percentage of students who chose not to check the boxes for race and ethnicity on their applications. At Princeton, for instance, that number rose to 7.7% this year from just 1.8% last year. ""We've carefully adhered to the requirements set out by the SC,"" a spokesperson for Princeton, said. Yale and Duke did not comment.Asian American enrollment dropped to 29% from 35% at Duke; to 24% from 30% at Yale; and to 23.8% from 26% at Princeton. Black enrollment rose to 13% from 12% at Duke; stayed at 14% at Yale; and dropped to 8.9% from 9% at Princeton.In the court case, Harvard, supported by others like Yale, Princeton and Duke, argued that considering race as one of many factors in an application was the best way to achieve diversity in college classes. The SC ruled that giving preferences to students based on race violated the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment. To comply with the court's decision, colleges did not allow their admissions officers to see the boxes where applicants checked off their race or ethnicity until after students had been admitted.","Students for Fair Admissions sent letters to the schools questioning whether they were complying with rules laid out by the Supreme Court.

Titan submersible tragedy could have been averted? Key employee's big claim,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/titan-submersible-tragedy-could-have-been-averted-key-employees-big-claim/articleshow/113441010.cms,"A key employee, who warned about the possible risk the imploded Titan submersible faced before its last voyage, testified on Tuesday that the tragedy could have been averted if had looked into his complaint.David Lochridge , OceanGate ’s former operations director, said he was disappointed by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's move to not follow through on his complaint.""I believe that if OSHA had attempted to investigate the seriousness of the concerns I raised on multiple occasions, this tragedy may have been prevented,"" he said while speaking before a commission trying to determine what caused the Titan to implode en route to the wreckage of the Titanic last year, killing all five on board.""As a seafarer, I feel deeply disappointed by the system that is meant to protect not only seafarers but the general public as well,"" Lochridge added, according to news agency AP.During his testimony, Lochridge said that eight months after he filed a complaint with OSHA, a caseworker told him that the agency had not begun probing the case and that his case was listed after 11 cases. But by then, OceanGate was suing Lochridge -- in response to which, he filed a countersuit.About 10 months after he filed the complaint, he decided to walk away. The case was closed and both lawsuits were dropped.""I gave them nothing, they gave me nothing,"" he said of OceanGate.Lochridge further claimed that he frequently clashed with the company's co-founder and felt the company was committed only to making money.""The whole idea behind the company was to make money,"" Lochridge said. ""There was very little in the way of science,"" he said.Lochridge was one of the most anticipated witnesses to appear before a commission. His testimony echoed that of other former employees on Monday, one of whom described OceanGate head Stockton Rush as volatile and difficult to work with.The Titan submersible disappeared on 18 June 2023, after losing communication with its support ship following its descent about 400 miles off the coast of Newfoundland, Canada.Onboard were Stockton Rush; Shahzada Dawood, a British-Pakistani businessman; Dawood’s 19-year-old son Suleman; British aviation tycoon and explorer Hamish Harding; and Paul-Henri Nargeolet, a French maritime expert with extensive experience of the Titanic wreck site.Last month, Nargeolet’s family filed a lawsuit against OceanGate, accusing the company of misleading him about the submersible’s safety. Following the accident, OceanGate suspended its commercial and exploratory operations.Four days after the submersible disappeared, wreckage from the vessel was discovered about a third of a mile from the bow of the Titanic. Months later, divers recovered human remains amid the wreckage.","David Lochridge, OceanGate’s former operations director, said he was disappointed by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's move to not follow through on his complaint. Lochridge said that eight months after he filed a complaint with OSHA, a caseworker told him that the agency had not begun probing the case.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113441321,imgsize-41700,width-400,resizemode-4/113441321.jpg"

'He could actually be older'

A popular tourist attraction

Jonathan , born in 1832, holds the title of the world’s oldest living land animal . As of 2024, Jonathan, a Seychelles giant tortoise , is estimated to be 191 years old.Jonathan lives at the governor’s residence on the island of Saint Helena in the South Atlantic Ocean. He was brought to Saint Helena in 1882 and has since become a beloved figure there.Veterinarian Joe Hollins , who has cared for Jonathan and three other tortoises on Saint Helena since 2009, celebrates Jonathan's birthday each year on New Year’s Day.Although the governor of Saint Helena, Nigel Phillips, has unofficially assigned Jonathan a hatch date of December 4, 1832, Hollins prefers to celebrate on New Year’s Day, honoring Jonathan’s age rather than his exact birthdate. On his birthday, Jonathan typically spends his day slowly roaming in search of fresh clover and taking an afternoon nap, according to Hollins.Jonathan’s diet consists of various vegetation, including grasses, leaves, and fruits, which are essential for his health and longevity. His caretakers ensure he receives a balanced diet.Weighing approximately 200 kg and measuring about 1.2 meters in length, Jonathan remains in relatively good health despite his age. He spends his days basking in the sun, eating grass and leaves, and interacting with visitors. His remarkable longevity has made him a popular tourist attraction.Though Jonathan is blind and lacks a sense of smell, he still has excellent hearing.According to Hollins, Jonathan’s age could be even greater than recorded.Historical records show Jonathan grazing the governor’s mansion grounds between 1882 and 1886. A letter mentions that he was fully grown when he arrived from the Seychelles Islands in 1882, meaning he was at least 50 years old at that time. Hollins highlights Jonathan’s historical significance, noting that he was around 50 years old when the incandescent lightbulb was invented. During his lifetime, Jonathan has seen 31 governors come and go.Jonathan has exceeded the average life expectancy of 150 years for a land tortoise. As he has entered his 92nd year, Hollins remains hopeful that Jonathan will continue to greet visitors well into his third century.Hollins shares a deep affection for Jonathan, calling it a privilege to care for him. When Hollins first arrived, Jonathan had health issues, including cataracts and a deteriorating beak. Hollins introduced fresh fruits and vegetables into Jonathan’s diet, which significantly improved his health.Jonathan has become a major attraction on Saint Helena, drawing around 1,500 tourists annually. Due to high visitor interest, a tortoise corridor was introduced to allow tourists to view Jonathan without disturbing him.“He loves the chatter and interaction,” said Hollins, as quoted by The Washington Post, noting that Jonathan also enjoys the sounds from a nearby tennis court.“Whatever happens, I think we can be satisfied that we’ve done our best for him,” Hollins said, expressing his hope to be present for Jonathan’s 200th birthday celebration.","Jonathan, a Seychelles giant tortoise, is estimated to be 191 years old.
