Why are thousands of millionaires set to leave India?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-are-thousands-of-millionaires-set-to-leave-india/articleshow/111126381.cms,"Destinations

The United Arab Emirates will likely receive the largest number of Indian millionaires.

will likely receive the largest number of Indian millionaires. In the last decade, this number increased by 85%.

The country is expected to attract 6,700 HNWIs from around the world in 2024.

Factors like its zero income tax policy, golden visa programmes, luxurious lifestyle and strategic location make the UAE a favourite among wealthy migrants.

Other top destinations for migrating millionaires include the United States, Singapore, Canada, and Australia.

Millionaire matrix

The Henley report describes millionaires and HNWIs as individuals with liquid investable wealth of $10 lakh (about Rs. 8.34 crore) or more.

It said India has 3,26,400 HNWIs, the tenth-highest in the world.

India also had the third-highest number of billionaires: 120.

Globally, 1,20,000 millionaires are expected to migrate in 2024, an increase from last year’s 1,20,000.

Why leave?

Common reasons why millionaires relocate include business opportunities, healthcare, and standard of living.

There are safety and security as well as financial concerns such as taxes and retirement.

They also consider lifestyle factors like climate, nature, scenery and education opportunities.

Not really bad news

The report said this finding is not particularly concerning for India as it “continues to produce far more new HNWIs than it loses to emigration.”

Additionally, a majority of millionaires who leave India often retain businesses and second homes in the country, the report noted.

NEW DELHI: In 2023, India is expected to witness departation of approximately 4,300 millionaires , as reported by the Henley Private Wealth Migration report 2024.Although this figure represents a decline from the previous year's count of 5,100 millionaires, it still positions India as the country with the third-largest number of high net worth individuals ( HNWI ) seeking to relocate abroad.China and the United Kingdom are expected to surpass India in terms of the number of millionaires leaving their respective countries. The report highlights the ongoing trend of wealthy individuals exploring opportunities and shifting their residences to other nations.","In 2023, India is expected to witness departation of approximately 4,300 millionaires.

Trust of India: TOI No. 1 news brand in country,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/trust-of-india-toi-no-1-news-brand-in-country/articleshow/111121868.cms,"When it comes to the trust of India , there's no beating The Times of India . In a year that has witnessed a hard-fought election, which saw rumour mills go into overdrive and social media being flooded with gossip and fake news, India once again turned for reliable and authentic information to its most trusted source.TOI is the most trusted major news media brand in India, according to a 47-country survey conducted by Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism (RISJ), Oxford University. The survey, released as part of Digital News Report 2024, an annual publication by the institute, found TOI had a trust score of 71. TOI had also topped the survey in 2021 and 2022.While the report does not make any cross-country comparisons, just how high a trust level 71 signifies can be seen from the fact that the most trusted brand in the UK, BBC News, had a trust score of 62 and the most trusted paper in that country, Financial Times, scored 57. Similarly, in the US, local TV news had the highest trust score of 62 while New York Times (50), Wall Street Journal (49), CNN (48) and Washington Post (46) scored much lower.The high level of trust is particularly noteworthy in the year of an election with sharply polarised opinion and mainstream media being challenged by social media channels.In general, in India print brands were more prominent at the top of trust scores, with the exception of govt media and BBC News. In the West, as evident from the US and UK examples, the pattern was very much the reverse, with television brands topping the trust charts. It is hardly surprising that India had the highest proportion of respondents (40%) who used print media as a source of news. In the US, that proportion was 16% and in the UK 14%.In India, the respondents were mainly English-speaking, online news users, leaning towards a more affluent, younger, educated, and city-dwelling population. The survey therefore reflects the opinions and attitudes of this section. The survey in India was done in collaboration with Asian College of Journalism.","TOI is the most trusted major news media brand in India, according to a 47-country survey conducted by Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism (RISJ), Oxford University.

It is an identity, an honour, a value, a mantra, and a saga,"" said Modi, highlighting that despite the destruction of the ancient university's libraries by invaders in the 12th century, the essence of knowledge remains indestructible.""The emergence of the new Nalanda University shows fire can destroy books but not knowledge,"" he said during the event attended by Bihar CM Nitish Kumar, external affairs minister S Jaishankar , and representatives from 17 countries.Highlighting the broader significance, Modi said: ""My mission is to see India become the centre of education and knowledge for the world.

The policy aims to exploit the vast offshore wind energy potential within India's exclusive economic zone. Under the scheme, private developers, selected through a transparent bidding process, will establish the projects while the Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd (PGCIL) will construct the power excavation infrastructure, including offshore substations. The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy will coordinate with various Ministries and Departments to ensure successful implementation of the scheme.""Construction of offshore wind energy projects and its operations also require specific port infrastructure, which can handle storage and movement of heavy and large dimension equipment.

Some told TOI they had to watch the staff run scissors through their clothes or ditch them in the trash can.CPB rules say an individual can carry one counterfeit item of each type (like one shirt, handbag, or pair of shoes) provided it is for personal use and not for sale. Anything in ""excess"" of this is banned.I travelled to the US to meet my son, who is pursuing a master's in supply chain management in Texas. I was carrying eight shirts, four trousers, some socks, and a pair of shoes.

Since they threatened me with criminal charges, I had no choice but to let them seize everything immediately.""The traveller said many of the clothing items were torn before being discarded. ""I lost goods worth at least Rs 30,000,"" added the 43-year-old, appealing to authorities to mention these rules on relevant platforms for the benefit of travellers.""How do we know this (rule) if it is not prominently mentioned in the dos and don'ts guide that gives travellers a checklist of what can be carried and what can't,"" asked a 27-year-old student from Hyderabad who had a similar experience a few months ago.""It is very common in India for people to sell and buy copies of big brands.I had no idea that carrying them in my luggage is such a serious offence.""

Unicef: India among 20 nations with ‘severe child food poverty’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/unicef-india-among-20-nations-with-severe-child-food-poverty/articleshow/111121794.cms,"NEW DELHI: Unicef 's new metric on 'child food poverty' exposes the magnitude of the food and nutrition crisis in children under 5 years of age across the world with India along with neighbouring countries China, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Pakistan figuring among the 20 countries home to 65% of the 181 million children globally living in ""severe child food poverty "".The numbers show that 1 in 4 children (27%) globally figure in the severe category as they are surviving on extremely poor diets. These findings are part of Unicef's global 'Child Nutriton Report 2024'. The percentage of children living in severe child food poverty in 92 countries with available data ranges from 1% in Belarus to 63% per cent in Somalia with the percentage for India at 40% which is categorised as 'high'.Unicef defines child food poverty as children's inability to access and consume a nutritious and diverse diet in first 5 years of life. The forces driving severe child food poverty include ""poor food environments for children, poor feeding practices and household income poverty affecting children and their families"". It is a problem affecting both the poor and non-poor households.The report cautions that severe child food poverty is driving child undernutrition and percentage of children living in severe child food poverty is three times higher in countries with a high prevalence of stunting.The findings of this global study hold signficance for India given that the National Family Health Survey-5 (2019-21) of the Union health ministry puts the prevalence of stunting at 35.5%, wasting at 19.3% and underweight at 32.1% for under 5 children.Even though it is an improvement over NFHS (2015-16) when prevalence of stunting was 38.4%, wasting was 21.0% and underweight was 35.8%, undernutrition continues to be concern.The UN report also states that children deprived of good nutrition in early childhood do less well at school and have lower earning capacity in adulthood, trapping them in a cycle of poverty and deprivation.In the report 'child food poverty' is measured using the Unicef and WHO dietary diversity score wherein for healthy development, children need to consume foods from at least five out of the eight defined food groups. Some of the things listed in the food groups include breastmilk, dairy, pulses to grains, eggs, meat, poultry and fish, vitamin A- rich fruits among others.A total of 2 in 3 children (66%) under 5 are living in child food poverty. This amounts to an estimated 440 million children who are unable to access and consume nutritious and diverse diets comprising at least five of the eight food groups. Children who are fed 0-2 food groups a day are seen to be living in severe child food poverty. The report shows that ""1 in 3 children (32%) experience severe child food poverty in countries with a high prevalence of stunting, compared to 11% in countries with a low prevalence; and odds of stunting are 34% higher affected by severe child food poverty compared to children who are not affected,"" it is stated.","1 in 4 children (27%) globally figure in the severe category as they are surviving on extremely poor diets.

Financial outlay for the central sector scheme - to be implemented between 2024-25 and 2028-29 - will be met out of the home ministry's own budget.The strengthening and upgrade of forensic capabilities nationwide is expected to take care of the higher demand for forensics in investigation of crimes under the new criminal laws, which come into effect from July 1, as they provide for mandatory forensic examination of the crime scene and evidence for offences punishable with imprisonment of seven years or more. An MHA spokesperson said the new criminal laws will significantly increase the workload of forensic laboratories, which are currently grappling with a lack of trained forensic manpower .Stressing on the need for significant investment and enhancement in national forensic infrastructure to enable the smooth rollout of BNS, BNSS and BSA, the home ministry said the establishment of additional off-campuses of the NFSU and new CFSLs would address the shortage of trained forensic manpower in the country. This way the case load or pendency of forensic laboratories will be reduced and the Govt of India's goal of securing a high conviction rate of more than 90%, can become a reality, it added.Home minister Amit Shah, in a post on 'X', thanked PM Modi for the ""landmark decision to bolster India's criminal justice system by opening a chain of state-of-the-art forensic laboratories and NFSU campuses across the nation"".

"Monsoon at a standstill since June 12, stalled movement delays Kharif crop sowing",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/stalled-monsoon-delays-kharif-crop-sowing/articleshow/111121545.cms,"NEW DELHI: The monsoon , which made its onset over Kerala two days in advance and arrived in the North-East six days before its normal date, has remained almost at a standstill since June 12 after making gradual progress and covering roughly 40% of the geographical area during the first 14 days. The current relatively longer hiatus has not only contributed to the current heat wave phase but also delayed sowing operation of kharif (summer sown) crops in north and North-West India.Though the India Meteorological Department (IMD), banking on upcoming La Nina formation, still maintains that the country is most likely to get fairly good rainfall during July-Sept, it has downgraded its forecast for June rainfall for the country as a whole from 'normal' to 'below normal' due to the current pause in the movement of monsoon.La Nina conditions - climate pattern associated with the periodic cooling of ocean surface temperatures in the central and east-central equatorial Pacific - are generally associated with good monsoon rainfall in India. Past data shows that the summer monsoon was either 'normal' or 'above normal' in most of the last 22 La Nina years since 1954 except 1974 and 2000 when it was below normal. IMD has, already, predicted 'above normal' monsoon rainfall for the country as a whole this year.""Monsoon hiatus is very common in the monsoon season. Monsoon does not progress in one stretch. But the current hiatus is relatively longer. It could be associated with the intra-seasonal activity and also Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO),"" said Madhavan Rajeevan, climate scientist and former secretary, ministry of earth sciences. MJO is one of the most important atmospheric-ocean coupled phenomena in the tropics, which has a profound influence on the Indian summer monsoon.Asked whether the current hiatus will impact the overall quantitative outcome of the monsoon, Rajeevan said, ""We need to wait for the next spell to revive the monsoon. That is expected during the last week of June. Anyway, June will be deficient. But we should not worry. We will have a normal monsoon.""Delayed monsoon will, however, its implications on the farming operation as it would delay sowing of kharif crops, mainly water-guzzling paddy, which will eventually reduce the gap between harvest of kharif crops and sowing of next (rabi) crops — a situation which invariably leads to more stubble burning episodes in north-west India as farmers have to rush to prepare ground for sowing wheat and mustard. Share of stubble burning is quite high in overall air pollution load in Delhi-NCR and neighbouring states during winter.“We will advise farmers to go for direct seeded rice (DSR) method of cultivation to save time. But this method has, so far, not got universal acceptance. Farmers continue to go for the traditional method of prior nursery preparation and transplantation that consumes a lot of time,” said an official in the agriculture ministry.",The monsoon has remained almost at a standstill since June 12 after making gradual progress and covering roughly 40% of the geographical area during the first 14 days.

Good sleep can help reduce high BP risk in children: Study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/good-sleep-can-help-reduce-high-bp-risk-in-children-study/articleshow/111121502.cms,"NEW DELHI: It is not just the adults. Many children also suffer from hypertension or high blood pressure.While earlier it was thought that changing the diet and improving physical activity are the best non-pharmacological interventions to manage it, new research published in the journal Paediatrics suggests adequate sleep and going to bed earlier are equally important.""We recommend that when a paediatrician identifies a patient (children and teenagers) with elevated blood pressure, in addition to standard counselling, a patient would benefit from counselling on optimal sleep health ,"" study author Amy J Kogon, a pediatric nephrologist at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia , said in a video abstract.Kogon and his team studied the link between sleep and blood pressure in 539 children and teens who were being evaluated for high blood pressure at the hospital's paediatric nephrology clinic.According to study, they found that on average the children and teens slept just over nine hours per night. Every extra hour of sleep duration was associated with reduced odds of increased blood pressure in the morning. Later sleep onset was associated with worse daytime blood pressure parameters, the researchers found.In India, some studies suggest that nearly 7% of school-going children suffer from hypertension.Dr Krishan Chugh, principal director of paediatrics at Fortis Gurugram said the Philadelphia hospital study scientifically proves what has been widely believed earlier also that a good sleep is essential for maintaining the normal blood pressure and working of the heart, besides that of the brain and the mind.""In recent times, it has been noticed that many adolescents are having high blood pressures, both systolic and diastolic, even when they're not suffering from any other illness. Yes, many of them are overweight or obese, but as such, do not have any disease like a kidney disease. High blood pressure in younger children leads to all the adverse effects that are noticed in adults with hypertension,"" Dr Chugh said. He added that it is not only sleeping for a number of hours that is important, but also sleeping at the right time and not too late to match the biological cycle of a normal human being that needs to be practised.Dr Dhiren Gupta, senior consultant paediatrician at Sir Ganga Ram hospital, said shortened sleep duration in children and adolescents predisposes them to inattention, hyperactivity, easy irritability and poor appetite control among others. Ideally, Dr Gupta said, children aged between six to 12 years should sleep for nine to 12 hours daily.","Research suggests adequate sleep and going to bed earlier are equally important.

"EVMs: Experts: EVMs can’t be connected to any device or system, not even power supply",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/experts-evms-cant-be-connected-to-any-device-or-system-not-even-power-supply/articleshow/111069006.cms,"Mumbai: The Indian EVM machine, M3 (model 3), used in the recent Lok Sabha election in which more than 600 million people cast their vote, are complex machines but tamper-proof , say engineers and domain experts.Likening an EVM machine to a simple calculator that cannot be hacked, Rajat Moona, director, IIT Gandhinagar and a member of the technical panel responsible for designing EVMs , said the current conversation around ways to gain illegal access to the voting machine is political in nature and he would therefore like to steer clear of it, but technically speaking, “no EVM can be hacked into or tampered with”. American billionaire Elon Musk who said electronic voting machines — like any device — can be compromised, has once again sparked debate that, experts say, surfaces every few years though no one is really able to prove that Indian EVMs can be tampered with. The machines, said experts, are strictly one-time programmable only, do not interact with other systems and are exclusively meant for voting. The M3 version used in the recently held polls are a smarter version than their predecessor, with several functions that are automated, including a first-level check, like computers carry out before they boot up.“The EVMs, if tampered with, also have a technology to return to factory setting and stop responding completely,” explained experts. These machines are not connected to the internet nor do they have a radio frequency (RF) to respond to Bluetooth; they are not even connected to a power socket.Introduced in 2019, the M3 machines will be used for several state polls and have a lifetime of 15 years before they are phased out and an updated version is launched.“We are already exploring all the new technology that can be brought in for the M4 machines,” said a member of the expert panel.Interestingly, to “remain completely independent”, none of the panel members charge a fee or accept an honorarium to design the architecture or technology of the EVM machines.“That was the only way we knew we could remain totally independent,” said Dinesh Sharma, emeritus professor and expert in microelectronics and solid-state electronics at the department of electrical engineering of the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay.After every election, there are “canards” on how the Indian EVM machines can be hacked ; so Sharma has a two-hour-long talk available in the public domain on busting all those myths. He plans to release an updated video in about a month with regards to the new machines and security features in them for general public so that they can repose their faith in Indian voting process.In his video, Sharma distinguishes between voting machines in other parts of the world and those in India. “Indian EVMs are different from other EVMs in the world. The M3 EVMs have no connection to any other device, not even mains power supply. The EVM machines do not talk to any other device. They are only designed for voting and are not a general-purpose computing device with a loaded programme for electronic voting. So, our EVM can do nothing else. No other programme or software can be loaded on to them. Also, if there is an issue with the system, the machine has to be discarded,” he says in his talk to experts and students. “Each EVM is a unique electronic island in itself, and this makes them super secure.”At every step, the machines undergo third party review for the software. Mock polling is also done multiple times in the presence of candidates’ representatives, following which, the machines are sealed with “rare” paper from the Nashik security printing press; this is the same paper used to print Indian currency notes.Each time, the machines are sealed or opened, it is done in the presence of candidates standing for elections or their representatives. Also, when EVMs are transported and stored before polling day, the storage room has to meet strict criteria, like having only one door.“There is also a provision to allow candidates or their representatives to camp outside 24/7 till the polling day,” explained Sharma.Interestingly, for the general elections, as per the mandate of the Supreme Court, tallying of ballot slip counts of 20,625 randomly chosen VVPATs with the electronic counts of their control units is carried out. If no mismatch between EVM and VVPAT counts is found in such a sample, then it can be said with near certainty that the sanctity of the election process is not disturbed by the use of EVMs, say experts. Till date, ballot slips of 41,629 randomly selected VVPATs have been tallied with the electronic counts of their Control Units and not a single case of transfer of vote meant for candidate ‘A’ to candidate ‘B’ has been detected.Differences in count, if any, have always been traceable to human errors like non-deletion of mock-poll votes from the Control Unit or non-removal of mock poll slips from VVPAT, wherein it is possible to identify and remove the mock poll votes. As Moona said, the matter is political in nature, but technically, the “Indian EVMs cannot be hacked”.","The Indian EVM machine, M3 (model 3), used in the recent Lok Sabha election in which more than 600 million people cast their vote.

The CMDA previously raided mango stalls involved in similar practices. Artificial ripening can make fruits appear ripe in a few hours, compared to the week it takes naturallyTo identify artificially ripened fruits, say experts, consumers should look for uneven colouring. If a banana or mango is green in some areas and yellow in others, particularly around the stem, it’s likely been treated with ethylene. Naturally ripened fruits, on the other hand, have uniform colour.Former director of public health Dr K Kolandasamy, warns that consuming ethylene-treated fruits can cause stomach aches, vomiting, and irritation. “Long-term consumption can harm the body’s internal systems. The FSSAI has banned artificial ripening of edible produce, and we need stringent actions and surveillance to enforce this,” he said.Dr Kolandasamy also noted that artificial ripening caters to mass market demands, as vendors struggle to keep produce for long. “Naturally, we put fruits inside a rice container to speed up the ripening process. This can be followed for households,” he added.","Eight shops in Koyambedu wholesale market were found using ethylene gas to ripen bananas artificially. ethylene poses serious health risks when applied to food, according to experts. Consumers should look for uneven colouring in artificially ripened fruits.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111069257,imgsize-311068,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/111069257.jpg"
CCI clears We Work Inc’s exit from India unit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/cci-clears-we-work-incs-exit-from-india-unit/articleshow/111118663.cms,"MUMBAI: The Competition Commission of India (CCI) has approved WeWork Inc ’s exit from its India unit by selling its entire 27% stake in the local arm. The process will be completed in two steps, the CCI said in a recent notification.

To begin with, certain share capital of WeWork India will be acquired by Real Trustee Advisory Company and a group of independent investors from the company’s majority stakeholder Embassy Group. Separately, the Embassy Group will acquire 100% share capital of 1 Ariel Way Tenant (OAW) from WeWork International. OAW holds the share of WeWork India on behalf of WeWork International. WeWork declined to comment. Currently, Bengaluru-based Embassy Group holds about 73% stake in WeWork India. Real Trustee is the trustee of Volrado Ventures which are alternative investment funds (AIF) registered with SEBI.

Once a high flying startup, WeWork which was valued at $47 billion at its peak had filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy in the US last year. It recently emerged from bankruptcy, completed its global operational and financial restructuring and appointed John Santora as its new CEO. Troubles at WeWork unfolded following a failed attempt at going public in 2019 and the subsequent pandemic which crippled businesses operating in the shared office spaces market.

The Indian unit of WeWork, however, has been growing fairly well and recently expanded in Pune and Gurgaon. It currently runs co-working spaces across more than 50 locations in eight cities.

WeWork India which competes with players like Awfis and 91 Springboard posted revenues of Rs 1,400 crore in FY23.

"Govt okays hike in MSP of 13 Kharif crops, skips green gram",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-okays-hike-in-msp-of-13-kharif-crops-skips-green-gram/articleshow/111120867.cms,"New Delhi: The govt on Wednesday approved new minimum support price (MSP) for 13 kharif crops in 2024-25 marketing season, recommending the highest absolute increase over the previous year for oilseeds and pulses in a signal to farmers to opt for growing these crops with an eye on trimming the country’s import bill.Accordingly, MSP of (oilseed) niger was hiked by Rs 983 per quintal followed by another oilseed sesamum (Rs 632 per quintal) and pulses, tur/arhar (Rs 550 per quintal). The MSP of the most popular kharif crop, paddy, was, however, increased by merely Rs 117 per quintal -- from Rs 2,183 per quintal in 2023-24 to Rs 2,300 per quintal in 2024-25 (rise of 5.3%).In 2023-24, the hike in MSP for paddy over the previous year was Rs 143 per quintal (7% increase over 2022-23). Relatively less hike this year in MSP of water-guzzling paddy can be attributed to the govt’s focus on other crops - oilseeds, pulses and coarse grains - so that farmers can gradually switch over to less water consuming and sustainable crops for better returns over their cost of production.Since the govt has been promoting cultivation of nutri-cereals (coarse grains), the MSP of Ragi has been increased by Rs 444 per quintal - a hike of 11.5% over 2023-24.“This ( MSP hike ) is the first Cabinet decision taken in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s third term in office,” said information and broadcasting minister Ashwini Vaishnaw while sharing details of the Cabinet decision.The expected margin to farmers over their cost of production are estimated to be highest in case of bajra (77%) followed by tur/arhar (59%), maize (54%) and urad (52%). For the rest of the crops, margin to farmers over their cost of production is estimated to be at 50%. ""The hike is in line with the Union Budget 2018-19 announcement of fixing the MSP at a level of at least 1.5 times of the all-India weighted average cost of production,"" said Vaishnaw.Though pulses got priority in the new MSP, moong (green gram) is missing from the list even as it is cultivated in the kharif season in north India. It means the MSP of moong will remain unchanged at Rs 8,558 per quintal. In south India, moong is cultivated in rabi season.","MSP of niger was hiked by Rs 983 per quintal followed by another oilseed sesamum and pulses, tur/arhar.

HC rejects professor’s plea seeking NOC for appointment outside state,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/hc-rejects-professors-plea-seeking-noc-for-appointment-outside-state/articleshow/111121155.cms,"DEHRADUN: The Uttarakhand high court has dismissed the petition of an assistant professor at the Government Medical College in Haldwani, seeking a no objection certificate (NOC) from the principal to apply for a vacant position at Banaras Hindu University (BHU) in Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh. The court stated that “if the employer has reservations against an employee seeking employment elsewhere, the employer possesses the authority to refuse granting an NOC . This is an inherent right that every employer holds.”When the petitioner, Rudresh Negi, applied for the NOC, the principal sought directives from the director of medical education, who instructed him to make a decision in accordance with a government order issued in 2020, which states that the principal shall issue an NOC to a teacher of a govt medical college if the teacher has applied for an appointment at another college within the state. However, in Negi’s case, the NOC was sought for employment outside the state.Negi had approached the court, seeking to quash the order and instruction, and demanded that the department issue him an NOC. Negi’s counsel contended that the 2020 order is arbitrary and illegal, arguing that all medical colleges constitute a homogeneous class. Therefore, the artificial classification made by the order between govt medical colleges within the state and other medical colleges is unsustainable, and the order deserves to be set aside. However, the court did not accept this argument.The chief standing counsel CS Rawat submitted that an employee cannot claim an NOC for seeking employment elsewhere as a matter of right, and every employer has the right to reject the request for an NOC if the situation warrants it. The state counsel maintained that the impugned order does not restrict an employee’s freedom of choice in seeking employment elsewhere, however, an employer cannot be compelled to issue an NOC to an employee in such matters. Rawat contended that the grant of an NOC is the sole prerogative of the employer and if the employer deems an individual indispensable to the institution, the request for an NOC can be turned down without violating any law.The division bench, comprising Justice Manoj Tiwari and Justice Pankaj Purohit, found merit in the submission made by the state counsel, emphasising that a significant amount of public funds would be squandered if a govt medical college loses recognition due to non-compliance with the norms pertaining to the minimum strength of teachers. “The decision has been taken in the interest of the public to ensure the continued operation of government medical colleges in the State and to safeguard the interests of both students and the masses,” the court remarked.The HC also observed that Uttarakhand, being a hill state, faces a scarcity of faculty members in its govt medical colleges. The National Medical Commission (NMC) has established minimum standards regarding the requisite strength of faculty members in medical colleges, and failure to meet these prescribed standards may result in the loss of recognition for the college. Such a loss would have devastating consequences, not only for the students but also for the masses who rely on govt medical colleges for quality medical services.",The Uttarakhand high court has dismissed the petition of an assistant professor at the Government Medical College in Haldwani.

Karnataka eyes 16% industrial growth,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/karnataka-eyes-16-industrial-growth/articleshow/111125876.cms,"Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah

BENGALURU: Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah has set an ambitious target of achieving an annual industrial growth rate of 15% to 16% to transform the state into a $1 trillion powerhouse by 2032. In the past decade, industries in Karnataka have witnessed a growth rate of 9.3%. With a gross state domestic product (GSDP) of $268 billion in the 2022-23 fiscal year, Karnataka stands as the third-largest economic powerhouse in India. The state boasts the highest per capita GSDP in the country, surpassing the national per capita GDP.

Speaking at the curtain-raiser of Invest Karnataka 2025, the state's flagship global investors meet, Siddaramaiah emphasised his government's commitment to balanced regional development through cluster development. ""Economic growth must be beyond metro areas to ensure every region flourishes. We will have training institutions in rural areas so that there is equitable growth in rural areas as well. We want to harness the untapped potential of rural talent,"" he said. The government is fostering specialized industries by leveraging local expertise and resources, identifying clusters across the state to develop priority sectors such as electronics, auto and EV, pharmaceuticals, and textiles.

Industries minister MB Patil announced that the Karnataka Industrial Policy 2025-2030 will provide a range of incentives to encourage industrial growth in the state. The theme for the 2025 edition of Invest Karnataka would be ""Reimagining Growth,"" which reflects the state's commitment to fostering growth that is tech-driven, green, inclusive, and resilient. The investor meet will be held between February 12-14 next year in Bengaluru.

As Invest Karnataka approaches, the state government has emphasized sustainability, technology, and job creation as the primary focus areas. The summit will feature discussions on clean mobility, the application of blockchain and artificial intelligence, and investments aimed at societal betterment. On a different note, Patil also expressed Karnataka's willingness to offer a 20% subsidy if the central government extends a 50% subsidy to support the semiconductor industry in the state. ""I have confidence that Kumaraswamy will not backtrack on this,"" he wrote on X.

Tribal communities roll out seed balls for forest regeneration during monsoon,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/raipur/tribal-communities-roll-out-seed-balls-for-forest-regeneration-during-monsoon/articleshow/111125997.cms,"RAIPUR: In an effort to rejuvenate forests this monsoon , tribal communities , including the Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), are crafting seed balls . Mixed with dried summer seeds, soil, and vermicompost, over 15,000 of these balls are prepared in Dhamtari for scattering across forests and barren lands to enhance greenery and restore habitats.Dhamtari district collector Namrata Gandhi told TOI that the initiative aims to restore vegetation in forest areas affected by forest fires, encroachments, and other environmental challenges. The seed balls have a dual purpose: regenerating forests and providing food for animals in the forest to prevent them from entering village areas and destroying kitchen gardens, particularly due to monkeys causing havoc in these areas.Vegetation such as blackberry (Jamun), guava (Amrood), and bottle gourd (Lauki) will be among the plants whose seeds will be dispersed in barren areas. This regeneration of such plantations will help decrease the number of animals moving towards the villages. This is a major reason why villagers or tribal people are unable to maintain vegetation in their backyards.Tribal communities have been practising this seed germination process for ages, although it has diminished over time. During the summer season, the community gathers and collects seeds from various trees and then spreads them in forest areas, which eventually leads to reforestation.As part of the forest rights recognition, the community collaborates with the forest department to identify patches of forests or barren lands suffering from deforestation or soil erosion. Community elders inform the forest department about the areas affected. Afterwards, tribals, villagers, and community members prepare seed balls by mixing seeds with proper sand, silt, clay, and bio compost, with each ball containing three to four seeds.The collection of seeds and making of seed balls are done simultaneously during the summer season, as the seed balls need to dry. When the monsoon weather begins, villagers use the broadcast seeding method to disperse seeds, which germinate automatically with the rain. The broadcast seeding method involves scattering seeds by hand over a relatively large area to achieve even distribution across the entire sowing area.Community members do not risk sowing new seeds in these places without understanding the nature of the soil and the plant species that will survive there. Only after this assessment do they begin disbursing seeds, said a forest official.Areas identified for seed dispersal in Dhamtari district include Aalmuda Karhaiya (850 hectares), Neginala (1,270 hectares), Govindpur (900 hectares), Sarangpuri (1,200 hectares), Koliyari (900 hectares), Palgaon (900 hectares), Baranharra (400 hectares), and Bagrumnala (500 hectares).Apart from the Dhamtari district, Bhanupratappur, a town in the Kanker district, has also prepared seed balls. A maximum number of women have participated in the process of preparing the seed balls. NGOs working in these areas have motivated and trained the villagers in this preparation.Twenty villages in Bhanupratappur, including Biskondal, Barbaspur, Ghotha, Tudge, Karathi, Chargaon, Vinayakpur, Kuanpaani, Janakpur, Junwani, Doomskot, Khora, Kanachur, Bagwahi, Pichekatta, Chichgaon, Alwar Khurd, Astara, Ranidongri, and Tedhaikondal, have been involved in this initiative, officials said","The initiative aims to restore vegetation in forest areas affected by forest fires, encroachments, and other environmental challenges.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class. The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

A Korean secret to keeping friendships strong: Savings groups,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/a-korean-secret-to-keeping-friendships-strong-savings-groups/articleshow/111121160.cms,"Last fall, Jina Kim and two of her friends splurged on a two-night stay at the Ananti at Busan Cove, a luxury resort in South Korea . The resort, where rooms start at $369 a night, features infinity pools, spas, restaurants, a private coastal walk and beach area, and a 4,600-meter Kim and her friends weren't worried about how they would pay for the trip because they had spent over a decade saving in a "" gyemoim "", a Korean term for people who form financial planning groups to save money for future expenses.Forming gyemoim groups can help friends or families split travel costs equally so everyone can participate, regardless of his or her personal budget. ""Honestly, if we didn't make the gyemoim, then it would have been too difficult for us to arrange that kind of trip,"" Kim said. ""It would have cost too much.""Collective financial planning has had a long history in many parts of the world. ""It's actually not unique to South Korea,"" said Euncheol Shin, a professor of economics in Seoul. ""This practice first developed because there was no financial market, and if you wanted to borrow some money, you had to do some self-financing.""Each member of a gyemoim contributes what are essentially ""club dues"" - often between $10 and $50 each month, with the amount decided by the group. As the balance increases, the members discuss how to spend it together. Kim first formed a gyemoim with two friends after they met at a social club in 2014. The three were attending different colleges and believed the gyemoim would allow them to regularly meet up.Initially, they each agreed to contribute 15,000 won (about $13) every month. Over the next decade, they saved more than 3,000,000 won ( $2,200) before deciding to spend the money on a trip to the Ananti, the resort. By then, the three friends had become busy with their own careers and families, but they remained close, in part, because of the gyemoim. ""It allowed us to keep in touch and have a good time together without worrying about the cost,"" Kim said.Gyemoim groups can work in South Korea because of the nature of the country's social interactions and culture of trust . You could walk into a coffee shop in Seoul and leave your bag without needing to worry.Forming a group to save is so common in South Korea that one bank is adapting to the custom. KakaoBank now offers a gyemoim group account where friends can share a bank account managed by one designated account holder. Some groups still prefer the ""old-fashioned"" method - entrusting funds to one member. Gyemoim groups don't last forever. Circumstances change, friends may've a falling-out, someone may no longer want to participate or a new person may want to join. When that happens, it's up to the collective to decide how to handle it. For a group to be successful, Kim said, members need to share similar interests.","Gyemoim is a Korean term for people who form financial planning groups to save money for future expenses.

NEW DELHI: At least 550 pilgrims lost their lives during the Hajj this year due to heat related issues, according to Arab diplomats. The temperature at the Grand Mosque in Mecca on Monday reached 51.8 degrees Celsius (125 Fahrenheit), according to the Saudi national meteorology centre.The majority of the dead were Egyptians, with 323 succumbing primarily to heat-related illnesses.""All of them (the Egyptians) died because of heat,"" said a diplomat, except for one who sustained fatal injuries during a minor crowd crush. The total figure was obtained from the hospital morgue in Mecca's Al-Muaisem neighbourhood.In addition to the Egyptian casualties, at least 60 Jordanians also perished during the pilgrimage, bringing the total reported deaths from various countries to 577, according to an AFP tally. The diplomats confirmed that the Al-Muaisem morgue, one of the largest in Mecca, recorded a total of 550 deaths.Saudi authorities reported treating over 2,000 pilgrims for heat stress but have not provided updated figures or information on fatalities since Sunday.Despite Saudi officials advising pilgrims to use umbrellas, stay hydrated, and avoid sun exposure during the hottest hours, many Hajj rituals require being outdoors for extended periods during the day. Some pilgrims reported seeing motionless bodies on the roadside and overwhelmed ambulance services.This year, around 1.8 million pilgrims participated in the Hajj, with 1.6 million coming from abroad. However, tens of thousands of pilgrims attempt to perform the Hajj without securing official visas each year to save money, which is more dangerous as they cannot access air-conditioned facilities provided by Saudi authorities along the route.","The temperature at the Grand Mosque in Mecca on Monday reached 51.8 degrees Celsius (125 Fahrenheit) The majority of the dead were Egyptians, with 323 succumbing primarily to heat-related illnesses.
