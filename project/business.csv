NEW DELHI: Delhi airport on Wednesday issued an advisory alerting passengers about potential disruptions to flights that are not CAT III compliant due to low-visibility conditions. Travellers are advised to contact their respective airlines for updated flight information.A thin layer of fog blanketed parts of Delhi this morning, with the minimum temperature recorded at 9°C. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted the possibility of dense fog in the coming hours, further impacting visibility.While Delhi airport is equipped with a CAT III-enabled runway, capable of facilitating safe landings under low-visibility conditions, flights without CAT III compliance may face delays or cancellations.Delhi experienced a sudden shift in weather as light rain swept through several parts of the city on Christmas Eve, bringing a festive chill. The showers, which took place on Tuesday, provided temporary relief from the persistent pollution issues plaguing the national capital.The rainfall helped settle dust and pollutants, resulting in a marginal improvement in air quality. Despite this, the city's Air Quality Index (AQI) on Tuesday night remained at 356, categorised as ""very poor.""CAT III, or Category III, is a precision approach system that enables aircraft to land safely during severe fog or poor visibility, ensuring operational continuity for compliant flights, according to ANI.The authority has urged passengers to stay updated on flight schedules and plan their travel accordingly.","A thin layer of fog blanketed parts of Delhi this morning, with the minimum temperature recorded at 9°C.

Atal Bihari Vajpayee: A statesman who shaped India with his vision & resolve,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/a-statesman-who-shaped-india-with-his-vision-resolve/articleshow/116645104.cms,"Today is a very special day for all of us. Our nation marks the 100th jayanti of our beloved former PM, Atal Bihari Vajpayee. He stands tall as a statesman who continues to inspire countless people.Our nation will always be grateful to Atalji for being the architect of India's transition into the 21st century. When he took oath as PM in 1998, we had passed through a period of political instability. In about nine years, we had seen four Lok Sabha elections. People of India were getting impatient and sceptical about govts being able to deliver. It was Atalji who turned this tide by providing stable and effective governance. Coming from humble roots, he realised the struggles of the common citizen and the transformative power of effective governance.One can see the long-term impact of Atalji's leadership in so many sectors. His era marked a gigantic leap in the world of infotech, telecom and communications. This was particularly important for a nation like ours, which is also blessed with a very dynamic Yuva Shakti. NDA govt under Atalji made the first serious attempt to make technology accessible to common citizens. At the same time, there was foresight in connecting India. Even today, most people recall Golden Quadrilateral Project, which connected the length and breadth of India.Equally notable were Vajpayee govt's efforts to enhance local connectivity through initiatives like Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana. Similarly, his govt gave a push to metro connectivity by doing extensive work for Delhi Metro, which stands out as a world-class infrastructure project. Vajpayee govt not only boosted economic growth but brought distant regions closer, fostering unity and integration.In the social sector, an initiative like Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan highlights how Atalji dreamt of building an India where modern education is accessible to people across the nation, particularly for the poor and marginalised. At the same time, his govt presided over many reforms that set the stage for India's economic surge after several decades of following a philosophy that encouraged cronyism and stagnation.A wonderful example of his leadership can be seen in the summer of 1998. His govt had just assumed office and on May 11, India conducted the Pokhran tests, known as Operation Shakti. The world was stunned and expressed its anger in no uncertain terms. Any ordinary leader would have buckled, but Atalji was made differently.India stood firm and resolute with the govt calling for another set of tests two days later, on May 13! If the tests of May 11 showed scientific skill, those on May 13 showed true leadership. It was a message to the world that gone were the days when India would buckle under threats or pressure. Despite facing international sanctions, the then NDA govt stood firm, articulating India's right to safeguard its sovereignty while simultaneously being the strongest proponent of world peace.Atalji understood Indian democracy and the need to make it stronger. He presided over the creation of NDA, which redefined coalitions in Indian politics. He brought people together and made NDA a force for development, national progress and regional ambitions. His parliamentary brilliance was seen throughout his political journey. He belonged to a party with a handful of MPs, but his words were enough to rattle the might of the all-powerful Congress party that time. As PM, he blunted the criticisms of the Opposition with style and substance. His was a career spent largely on Opposition benches, but he never carried any trace of bitterness against anyone, even though the Congress stooped to new lows by calling him a traitor!He was also not one to cling to power through opportunistic means. He preferred to resign in 1996 instead of following the path of horse-trading and dirty politics. In 1999, his govt was defeated by 1 vote. A lot of people told him to challenge the immoral politics happening then but he preferred to go by the rules. Eventually, he came back with another resounding mandate from the people.When it comes to commitment to protecting our Constitution too, Atalji stands tall. He was deeply impacted by the martyrdom of Dr Syama Prasad Mookerjee. Years later, he was a pillar of the anti-Emergency movement. In the run-up to the 1977 elections, he agreed to merger of his own party ( Jan Sangh ) into the Janata Party. I am sure it would have been a painful decision for him and the others, but safeguarding the Constitution was all that mattered to him.It is also noteworthy how deeply rooted Atalji was in Indian culture. Upon becoming India's external affairs minister, he became the first to speak in Hindi at the UN. This showcased his immense pride in India's heritage and identity, leaving an indelible mark on the global stage.Atalji's persona was magnetic and his life was enriched by his love for literature and expression. A prolific writer and poet, he used words to inspire, provoke thought, and offer solace. His poetry, often reflective of his inner struggles and hopes for the nation, continues to resonate with people across age groups.For so many BJP karyakartas like me, it is our privilege that we were able to learn and interact with a person like Atalji. His contribution to BJP was foundational. To spearhead an alternative narrative to a dominant Congress showed his greatness. Alongside stalwarts like L K Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi , he nurtured the party from its formative years, guiding it through challenges, setbacks and triumphs. Whenever the choice came between ideology and power, he always chose the former. He was able to convince the nation that an alternative world view from Congress was possible and such a world view could deliver.On his 100th jayanti, let us rededicate ourselves to realising his ideals and fulfilling his vision for India. Let us strive to build an India that embodies his principles of good governance, unity, and progress. Atalji's unwavering belief in the potential of our nation continues to inspire us to aim higher and work harder.","Today is the 100th jayanti of our beloved former PM, Atal Bihari Vajpayee.

What do you think of the political battle between NDA and INDIA bloc over Ambedkar's legacy?

What is the status of UCC?

Any update of action against illegal activities and land laws?

Local body elections are scheduled for Jan 2025...

How significant is the winter Char Dham Yatra for the state's tourism?

Uttarakhand is set to implement UCC in Jan, CM Pushkar Singh Dhami tells TOI while stating that stringent measures were being taken against illegal activities, including unauthorised madrasas and land law violations. Excerpts:Congress party is spreading misinformation and disrespecting B R Ambedkar's legacy. Congress has a history of sidelining Ambedkar, but BJP has honoured him by establishing memorials in key locations associated with him.Congress's allegations are an attempt to create confusion and divert the people's attention from BJP's focus on development and equality. Whether it's the 1952 or 1954 elections, Congress and Nehru always conspired to keep him out of Parliament. They made every effort to stop him. For a long time, they didn't give him the recognition he deserved, but the people will see through it.The state is ready to implement Uniform Civil Code in Jan. Training is ongoing, and the draft has been reviewed and approved by the President. The rules and regulations are in place. A (mobile) app is under development to facilitate registrations and other services, enhancing accessibility for residents.On illegal activities, including unauthorised madrasas and land law violations, strict measures are being implemented. Also, it is important to maintain law and order alongside addressing ecological concerns. Changes to land laws are under way and will be introduced in the next session.BJP continues to enjoy the support of people in Uttarakhand due to the state and Centre focusing on development and nationalism. The 'one nation, one election' decision is revolutionary. It will save resources, manpower and time, as frequent elections disrupt development work. This will be a milestone for the country.We've started a new winter pilgrimage. It started on Dec 8 from Omkareshwar temple, and is getting good response. Even in winter, significant number of devotees are visiting shrines. The arrangements ensure visitors face no inconvenience. This initiative aims to promote year-round pilgrimage tourism, showcasing Uttarakhand's scenic beauty.","Uttarakhand is set to implement UCC in Jan, CM Pushkar Singh Dhami tells TOI while stating that stringent measures were being taken against illegal activities.

Police termed the money lost as a huge amount, when compared to other such frauds.Vikram received a call from the mobile number 8791120931 on Nov 11 at around 10.30am. The caller introduced himself as an officer from the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) and told Vikram that a sim card procured in his name was used for illegal advertisements and harassment messages. The fraudster informed him that his Aadhaar was used to procure it. He said they have initiated the process of blocking the sim and a case was registered at the Colaba cyber police station in Mumbai.Later, another miscreant contacted him from mobile number 7420928275, claiming to be a police officer. He told Vikram that his Aadhar was used to open bank accounts for money laundering. They warned him not to disclose the call to anyone, including his family, as the fraud involved influential persons, who are already arrested in money laundering cases. They threatened to arrest him physically if he did not cooperate with the virtual investigation.Vikram then received a call from another number, 9997342801. The fraudsters made him download the Skype app. Subsequently, a person in police uniform made a video call, claiming to be from the Mumbai police. He alleged that businessman Naresh Goyal had opened an account at Canara Bank using Vikram's Aadhar and conducted transactions worth around Rs 6 crore.On Nov 25, another fake police officer contacted Vikram on Skype, claiming that the case against him was being heard in the Supreme Court and that the hearing needed to be completed. He threatened to arrest Vikram's family members if he did not comply with the hearing.Later, they told him that according to Reserve Bank of India (RBI) guidelines, they needed to verify his bank account transactions and instructed him to transfer money to accounts, provided by them for verification, assuring him that it would be returned.Fearing arrest, Vikram first transferred Rs 75 lakh to a bank account and later, Rs 3.41 crore to another account.

GST Council's popcorn taxation sparks backlash on social media,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-gst-rates-on-popcorn-spark-backlash-on-social-media/articleshow/116601956.cms,"NEW DELHI: The GST Council's proposal to levy different tax rates on popcorn based on whether it contains sugar or salt has faced extensive backlash on social media, with two former government economic advisers criticising the taxation framework established in 2017.The GST Council, led by the finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, on Saturday proposed 5% GST for non-branded popcorn with salt and spices, 12% for pre-packaged and branded varieties, and 18% for caramel popcorn, classified under sugar confectionery.The Union finance minister defended the 18% tax on caramel popcorn, stating that items containing added sugar attracts different taxation.Later, the GST Council issued a clarification, saying that pre-packed and labelled ready-to-eat snacks will attract a 12 per cent tax while an 18 per cent GST will be levied if it is caramelised. There is no change in the tax rate of popcorn and the GST Council has only agreed that the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) will issue a circular clarifying the current taxation regime of popcorn.However, opposition politicians, economists and government supporters expressed their disapproval while others responded with humour and satire.""Complexity is a bureaucrat's delight and citizens' nightmare,"" said former Chief Economic Adviser K V Subramanian on X, questioning the decision's value given its minimal revenue impact and public inconvenience.Additionally, his predecessor Arvind Subramanian, criticised the move for increasing complexity rather than simplifying the system, mentioning issues with enforcement and rationality.Meanwhile, Congress party leader and spokesman Jairam Ramesh criticised the ""absurdity of three different tax slabs for popcorn under GST"", saying how it exemplifies the increasing complexity of what was intended to be a straightforward tax system.","GST Council proposed 5% GST for non-branded popcorn with salt and spices, 12% for pre-packaged and branded varieties, and 18% for caramel popcorn, classified under sugar confectionery.

Weight loss drug gets US nod to treat sleep apnea; India launch likely next year,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/weight-loss-drug-gets-us-nod-to-treat-sleep-apnea-india-launch-likely-next-year/articleshow/116641374.cms,"NEW DELHI: In good news for those suffering from obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a condition characterised by disordered breathing during sleep, the US FDA has, for the first time, approved an anti-diabetic drug also used for weight loss, sold under the brand name Zepbound (Tirzepatide), to manage the condition in adults with obesity.Treatments currently for moderate to severe OSA involve using assistive breathing devices such as CPAP and Bi-Pap. Zepbound makers Eli Lilly said they would launch the injectable drug under the brand name Mounjaro in India by 2025 after obtaining all approvals. Pricing is yet to be finalised. ""Our pricing strategy in India will reflect the medicine's efficacy and the significant value it brings in reducing the overall health and economic burden of type 2 diabetes and obesity,"" Eli Lilly said. Approximately, 104 million Indians have OSA, and 47 million have moderate or severe OSA, according to a study published in Sleep Medicine Reviews.""One of the treatments for OSA is weight reduction. This drug helps in reducing weight and, therefore, helps improve breathing during sleep. So, it can certainly prove to be a game-changer. But we need to wait for long-term results, potential side-effects and its applicability in a range for OSA patients,"" said a senior doctor. OSA occurs when a person's upper airway becomes blocked, causing pauses in breathing during sleep. Zepbound's approval for moderate to severe OSA in obese adults was based on two randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of 469 adults without type 2 diabetes.","The US FDA has approved an anti-diabetic drug also used for weight loss.

Isro to launch SpaDex mission on Dec 30 for developing space docking tech,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/isro-to-launch-spadex-mission-on-dec-30-for-developing-space-docking-tech/articleshow/116641609.cms,"NEW DELHI: To take the first giant step towards launching India’s own space station and interplanetary missions, Isro is scheduled to launch the SpaDeX mission, which is aimed at developing and demonstrating a cost-effective technology required to dock and undock spacecraft in space, from Sriharikota at 9.58 pm on Dec 30 using its PSLV-C60 rocket.Through this mission, India is marching towards becoming the fourth country in the world to have space docking technology, Isro said. In a post on X, the space agency said, “PSLV-C60, fully integrated up to PS4 at the PIF facility for the first time, was moved to the MST at the First Launch Pad—over three hours captured in just a few seconds.”SpaDeX technology is essential for India's space ambitions such as landing an Indian on the Moon, sample return from the Moon, and building and operation of Bharatiya Antariksh Station, Isro said in an explainer.In-space docking technology is essential when multiple rocket launches are required to achieve common mission objectives. The SpaDeX mission was floated to develop and demonstrate the technology needed for rendezvous, docking and undocking of two small spacecraft in a low-Earth circular orbit, it said.The SpaDeX mission consists of two small spacecraft Target and Chaser (about 220 kg each) to be launched by PSLV-C60, independently and simultaneously, into a 470 km circular orbit at 55° inclination. The demonstrated precision of PSLV will be used to give a small relative velocity between Target and Chaser spacecraft at the time of separation from the launch vehicle. This incremental velocity will allow the Target spacecraft to build a 10-20 km inter-satellite separation with respect to Chaser within a day.At the end of this drift arrest manoeuvre, Target and Chaser will be in the same orbit with identical velocity, but separated by 20 km, known as Far Rendezvous. Chaser will then approach Target with progressively reduced inter-satellite distances of 5 km, 1.5 km, 500 m, 225 m, 15 m, and 3 m, ultimately leading to the docking of the two spacecraft.After successful docking and rigidisation, electrical power transfer between the two satellites will be demonstrated before undocking and separation of the satellites to start the operation of their respective payloads for the expected mission life of up to two years.Besides the docking demonstration, PSLV-C60 rocket’s fourth stage (POEM) will carry a total of 24 payloads that will be activated once two spacecraft are released in space. Of the 24, 14 payloads are from Isro centres and 10 payloads are from various non-government entities (NGEs) comprising academia and start-ups.","SpaDeX is aimed at developing and demonstrating a cost-effective technology required to dock and undock spacecraft in space.

3 Signs WWE is building up Cody Rhodes vs Drew McIntyre for WrestleMania 41,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/wwe/top-stories/3-signs-wwe-is-building-up-cody-rhodes-vs-drew-mcintyre-for-wrestlemania-41/articleshow/116637979.cms,"Cody vs McIntyre being built up? Image-WWE.com

1. Cody vs Kevin Owens will not last long

2. Drew McIntyre will not be busy for long

3. McIntyre’s recent TikTok session

The “Scottish Warrior” Drew McIntyre is on his tyrant path to destroy any and everyone who has aided Roman Reigns in the last six months or so. He has such deep rooted hate for the “OG Bloodline”, that he doesn’t let any chance go to beat up Sami Zayn and Jimmy/Jey Uso. But this new storyline of his is not worthy of a main event at the grandest age of them all. Moreover, there are indications that WWE is planning something big for the three time WWE World Champion, going into WrestleMania 41 .Here are the signs that tell us WWE is building up Drew McIntyre versus Cody Rhodes for WrestleMania 41Currently, the “American Nightmare” Cody Rhodes is recovering from a neck injury suffered at the hands of Kevin Owens, at Saturday Night’s Main Event. The Undisputed WWE Champion will surely come back and avenge the brutal “Piledriver” delivered by Owens on him. But when that happens, it would probably signal the end of that feud and he will have his plate empty, going into big ticket PLE’s like Royal Rumble, Elimination Chamber and WrestleMania 41. Also, he is probably done with Roman Reigns and there are no signs of The Rock coming back to deter him. Therefore, the signs are ominous that the next big draw, Drew McIntyre versus Cody Rhodes is going to be the main event of WrestleMania 41.Just like Cody, Drew McIntyre’s current feud with the Bloodline members is not a storyline that is worthy of the grandest stage of them all. Also, it is pretty evident that he’s in the purple patch of his life, if you consider the fruitful year that he has had in WWE. He might have lost some big matches, but he has also achieved almost everything in the last one year. After he finishes his feud with the likes of Sami and the Uso twins, it is only a matter of time that he targets the WWE Undisputed Champion, Cody, not just because he aided Roman Reigns, but also because he wants to capture the coveted WWE Title. Also, the two stalwarts have previously collided in other wrestling promotions and the contest was always mouth watering.In a recent TikTok live session , McIntyre clearly hinted towards something big against Cody. He didn’t want to spill too much, but whatever he said was enough to ignite speculations among the WWE fans that something massive is on between the “Scottish Psychopath” and the American Nightmare. “I don’t want to give too much away. It’s going to be significant when the time comes. The world is going to be along for the ride. Feelings will be hurt, bodies will be hurt”, said McIntyre in his viral TikTok live stream.","The “Scottish Warrior” Drew McIntyre is on his tyrant path to destroy any and everyone who has aided Roman Reigns in the last six months or so.

Paul Heyman

thanks Punk

I am a ""Paul Heyman guy""

One of the most prominent Paul Heyman-guys in WWE is CM Punk . The two have done some great work starting in 2012 and now the legendary manager has himself come out to credit the six time WWE World Champion for his comeback to WWE TV, back in 2012. While talking to “Inside the Ropes”, Heyman thanked Punk for making him relevant again in WWE, after he was almost forgotten by the fans all over the world.Recalling his legendary comeback to not just WWE but mainstream WWE television programs, Paul Heyman heaped praise and credits on CM Punk for playing a pivotal role in his return to WWE back in 2012. Notably, the notorious manager was away from any wrestling promotion and was working closely with Brock Lesnar , on different digital projects. Brock, who was involved in UFC back then was writing his autobiography and Heyman was involved with him in that project. Heyman had started feeling that he was a forgotten phenomenon in the Pro Wrestling industry back then. That’s when Punk appeared on WWE television and called himself a “Paul Heyman Guy”.During a particular segment on TV in Las Vegas, Punk came out and openly said, “I am a Paul Heyman guy”. Interestingly, this was a part of his famous “pipe bomb promo” that had become hugely popular among the WWE fans all over the world. Naturally, Punk being one of the most loved and popular superstars at that point of time and him calling himself a Paul Heyman guy made everyone speculative and curious about the whereabouts of Paul Heyman. The people known to Paul were taken aback, while the fans who did not have an idea about who Paul was, wanted to know more about him. Only a year prior to this, Paul was back to WWE, with Brock Lesnar and CM Punk.“So, when Punk went on television in 2011, I had been forgotten by that time. I was out of this business, doing a lot of the digital work with Brock Lesnar, who was in UFC. Brock and I had written Brock’s autobiography together. I was gone, I was part of history, part of a history that was quickly being written out and forgotten. And Punk came on television in Las Vegas of all places, the home of UFC and said, ‘That’s right, I’m a Paul Heyman guy.’ Because he was so hot at the time, people started Googling, ‘Well, who’s this guy Paul Heyman?’ Those who knew me were shocked to hear my name and those who had no clue who I was, became interested in who I was. So thanks to him, a year later, I’m back on television with Brock Lesnar.” Said Paul in his appreciation for Punk, who returned to WWE only last year at the Survivor Series PLE.",Paul Heyman credits CM Punk for making him relevant again in WWE.

Trinity Rodman speaks on pay disparity

The recognition struggle in women’s sports

Trinity Rodman: The Truth about My Family

But the issue is not confined to soccer

Small wins go a long way. Be it sports, or life. But those wins should never dull the fight for the larger victory. The same is true for the fight for equal pay in women’s sports, which saw a victory when the USWNT secured its deal. It inspired athletes across sports to demand fair pay. However, Trinity Rodman , heart and breath of Washington Spirit and the USWNT, revealed that while progress is evident, there are still miles to go.Speaking on the Call Her Daddy podcast, she shared her frustration over the vast pay gap between women in soccer and athletes in leagues like the NBA and NFL.Rodman didn’t hold back when asked about being a female athlete. She said, “Even just being on media and it’s like obviously NBA, NFL makes way more money, has way more viewers—not taking that away, but seeing the contracts and looking at ours, I’m just like, ‘I’m so grateful to be making the money that I make right now at my age, but I look and I’m just like, ‘agh.’”The contrast is stark. In the NBA, the average annual salary for the 2024-25 season is approximately $12 million. Meanwhile, the NWSL’s 2024 salary cap is $2.75 million. Such disparity highlights the economic divide between men’s and women’s sports. While leagues like the NFL and NBA enjoy massive viewership and sponsorship deals, women’s sports, particularly soccer, struggle to attract similar attention.Rodman also addressed a less tangible but equally painful issue: recognition. She shared another experience from the Call Her Daddy podcast: “The recognition for one, I think, even just in conversation it’s like, ‘Oh, who do you play for?’ – Spirit – and they’re like, ‘What’s that?’ I’m like, ‘Ugh.’”This disconnect between athletes and their audience highlights a problem that goes beyond. Despite numerous milestones and achievements, despite doing the unthinkable, and that too on the global stage, women’s soccer lacks the respect and visibility it deserves. The Washington Spirit forward was very clear in her take on how this impacts players mentally.Life, in general, deals women with difficult cards, every day. Be it sports, or any other profession. Across sports, women face hurdles in pay, recognition, and opportunities.While men’s leagues are favored by media houses and enjoy widespread coverage, drawing crowds larger than aspirations, women’s sports often operate with fewer resources. Rodman’s comparison between her earnings and those in the NBA or NFL is in her own, unique way, a wake-up call about systemic inequality.Also Read : Trevor Lawrence's wife, Marissa, dismisses pregnancy rumors as her due date approaches",Washington Spirit forward Trinity Rodman spoke on the Call Her Daddy podcast.

"Khalistan Zindabad Force chief hails from J&K, is now in Pakistan",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/khalistan-zindabad-force-chief-hails-from-jk-is-now-in-pakistan/articleshow/116609434.cms,"NEW DELHI: Khalistan Zindabad Force (KZF), to which the three pro-Khalistan terrorists killed in UP are being linked, is a radical Sikh outfit founded in 1993 by Ranjeet Singh @ Neeta, hailing from Simbal camp in Jammu, but currently ensconced in Pakistan. The outfit's aim is to establish a sovereign Khalistan state. It mostly drew its cadre from among radicalised Sikhs based in the Jammu region.According to former J&K DGP S P Vaid, Neeta had developed strong links with Pakistan's ISI during the eighties, when Punjab militancy was at its peak. He would head-hunt members of the sizeable Sikh population in the Jammu region, particularly the Simbal camp and R S Pora, and brainwash them into embracing violent extremism. In the nineties, when Neeta had struck a deal with ISI and taken shelter to Pakistan, KZF's modus operandi was to target buses/trains plying on the roads to Jammu, Punjab or Delhi.In 2009, the group turned to targeted killing of religious leaders in Punjab - Rashtriya Sikh Sangat chief Rulda Singh in July 2009 - and even abroad (Sant Ramanand of Dera Sachkand Ballan in Vienna). Since 2017-18, there have been intelligence inputs about Neeta using KZF cadre to target police facilities in Punjab. The UP encounter shows that the terrorists, after having carried out the recent bomb blasts at police facilities in Punjab, headed for Pilibhit where there is a sizeable Sikh community. ""It's a very positive development. Apart from putting the Khalistanis on the backfoot, the encounter highlights the good coordination between the Punjab and UP police,"" a former top officer of the Punjab Police told TOI.KZF is listed as a terrorist organisation under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. With international presence and associates spread across Pakistan, the UK, Switzerland, Italy, Germany, the US, Canada, Austria, Belgium, Nepal and Malaysia, it is also banned in European Union nations. These associates, as per the Union home ministry, carry out radicalisation of Sikh youths in Khalistan ideology , mostly through social media.Neeta was declared as an individual terrorist under the UAPA in 2020. As per a gazette notification, Neeta has been aiding, abetting, spearheading, operationalising and funding terrorist activities and pushing in consignments of arms, ammunition, explosive materials laced with narcotics from across the border into India to promote terrorism and support their actions against India. An Interpol Red Corner Notice had been pending against Neeta since 2000.Among attacks in India, in which KZF activists have been involved, are bomb explosions in two buses at Pathankot in April and June in 1997, which had killed and injured several passengers. A bomb was exploded by KZF on the Shalimar Express train in June 1998.One of the 20 terrorists that India wants Pakistan to deport, Neeta is alleged to have been involved in the killing of DSP Devinder Sharma in Kathua in J&K in Oct 2001.","Khalistan Zindabad Force (KZF) is a radical Sikh outfit founded in 1993 by Ranjeet Singh @ Neeta, hailing from Simbal camp in Jammu, but currently ensconced in Pakistan.

Father lambasts ministry, committee

RICH HAUL OF MEDALS IGNORED

OTHER OLYMPIC MEDALLISTS ALSO NOT IN KHEL RATNA LIST

NEW DELHI: Double Olympic medallist shooter Manu Bhaker ’s name missing from the recommendation list of the Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna award has created a furore. Caught on the back-foot, the sports ministry is now considering nominating her name for the country’s highest sporting honour by using its executive powers vested in the provisions of the National Sports Day awards scheme, TOI has learnt.Manu created history at the Paris Games 2024 after clinching back-to-back medals (bronze) in the women’s individual 10m air pistol and in the mixed team event partnering Sarabjot Singh, cementing her place as one of the greatest Indian athletes in Olympic sports. The 22-year-old from Haryana’s Jhajjar district became the first Indian to achieve such a feat at a single Olympic edition since India attained independence.Her omission from the list of athletes recommended for the Khel Ratna – as highlighted by TOI in its exclusive report on Monday – thus came as a huge surprise. The 12-member selection committee failed to take cognizance of her incredible achievements during the awards cycle period, where she won several medals at major multisport and international events.The committee recommended ace drag-flicker Harmanpreet Singh, who captained the Indian men’s hockey team to a bronze medal-finish in Paris, and para-athlete Praveen Kumar, who won gold in the men’s high jump T64 class with an Asian record at the Paris Paralympics, for the Khel Ratna.The authorities forgot that in the past, Olympic medallists were awarded the Khel Ratna upon their return to the country right after their successful campaign at the Summer Games. In 2021, all the medallists from the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games – who had not yet been awarded the Khel Ratna – were awarded with the honour by the govt. Strangely, the same gesture or rule wasn’t applied in the case of a deserving athlete as Manu.While the officials in the ministry claimed that the shooter didn’t apply for the award, Manu’s father Ram Bhaker maintained that she had indeed sent in her application. The point is, even if Manu had not applied for the award, why did the selection panel fail to take cognizance of her stupendous achievements as a shooter over the years?It’s been learnt that the ministry might invoke Articles 5.1 and 5.2 of the ‘Scheme for the Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna Award’ which state: “Sportspersons eligible in accordance with award guidelines will be permitted to self-apply without the recommendation of the authorities/persons. Notwithstanding the above, the government reserves the right to nominate up to two nominations in deserving cases.”According to sources, sports minister Mansukh Mandaviya is expected to go through the names of Khel Ratna, Arjuna, Dronacharya and Dhyanchand nominees and give his approval to the list on Wednesday. Sources said the minister, who has been travelling, has already been informed about the controversy surrounding Manu’s exclusion from the list.While the scheme provides that applicants should self-apply on the ministry’s portal for awards, the respective national sports federation (NSF) of athletes can also send the names of deserving sportspersons to the ministry online by filling up the details. The National Rifle Association of India ( NRAI ) did not nominate Manu for the Khel Ratna when ideally it should have.A source in the federation told TOI that it has now approached the ministry with a request to include Manu’s name.“Manu said she had applied on the portal. If that was the case, then the committee must have considered her name. Whatever the situation, the federation has approached the ministry and requested the officials to include her name,” the source said.Whether Manu’s name will feature in the final list of Khel Ratna awardees is yet to be seen, but it can be confirmed that she has also applied for the country’s third and fourth highest civilian awards – Padma Bhushan and Padma Shri, respectively. Manu’s twin applications for these awards are in possession of TOI. She applied on the Padma awards’ portal on Sep 15.Manu’s father on Monday lambasted the ministry and selection committee for ignoring his child’s achievements. “I regret putting her in the sport of shooting. I should have instead made her a cricketer. Then, all the awards and accolades would have come her way. She won two Olympic medals in a single edition, no one has ever done that. What else do you expect my child to do for the country? The govt must recognise her efforts. I spoke to Manu, and she was disheartened by all this. She told me ‘I shouldn’t have gone to the Olympics and won medals for the country. In fact, I shouldn’t have become a sportsperson’,” Bhaker told TOI.The govt’s note of October 24, 2024 inviting applications for Khel Ratna says: “To be eligible for Khel Ratna award, the spectacular and most outstanding performance in the field of sports by a sportsperson over a period of four years immediately preceding the year during which award is to be given will be considered for award for excellence in sports and games at international level i.e. Olympic/Paralympics/Asian/Commonwealth Games/Championships/World Cup/World Championships and equivalent recognised international tournaments. Accordingly, sports achievements for the period from January 1, 2020, up to the conclusion of the Olympics/Paralympics Games 2024 will be taken into consideration.”During this four-year awards cycle, Manu won several international medals of repute, the twin Olympic bronze medals in Paris topping the chart. During the period, Manu won 17 gold, six silver and five bronze medals spread across different editions of shooting World Championships, World Cups, Asian Games, Asian Championships, Junior World Championships, Junior World Cup and World University Games.Except for Harmanpreet Singh, not a single Paris Olympic medallist was recommended for the Khel Ratna by the committee. Even the bronze-winning shooting duo of Swapnil Kusale and Sarabjot Singh and wrestler Aman Sehrawat were not considered for the award and were instead recommended for Arjuna – the second highest sporting honour.In 2021, all the medallists (gold, silver & bronze) from Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics – who weren’t honoured with the Khel Ratna previously – were given the award by the ministry.",Double Olympic medallist shooter Manu Bhaker’s name missing from the recommendation list of the Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna award has created a furore.

The GST Council recently made an announcement on the tax structure of popcorn, triggering a flood of online jokes and confusion. The council held its 55th meeting and ruled out any alteration in the current tax regime and categorised popcorn into several categories depending upon their mode of preparation. Caramelised popcorn, which is sweet, is taxed at a higher rate, 18% whereas plain or salted popcorn attracts 5-12% tax. Now the clarification, while it tries to simplify the matter in one respect, has caused people to go wild with the memes and social media banter, where users had fun dissecting the differences in tax and questioning common sense behind such subtle differences in taxing snacks.The GST Council's clarification on the taxation of popcorn in its 55th meeting, the council confirmed that no changes would be made to the existing tax rates but clarified how different types of popcorn are taxed differently based on their ingredients and preparation methods.Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman explained that caramelized popcorn, because of sugar added, is taxed much higher than salted and plain popcorn. Here's a break-up of the GST rates:This is because of the method of preparation and the characteristics of each type of popcorn. For example, caramelised popcorn, which falls under sugar confectionery, attracts a higher rate of GST since it contains sugar, while salted popcorn remains at a lower rate because of its simplicity. The Council also pointed out that these different tax rates were determined by the different methods used to prepare the snack.To clear any confusion, the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) is expected to issue a detailed circular soon. Though the clarification was intended to smoothen the tax structure, it has also brought amusement on social media, as users found the distinctions between various types of popcorn to be rich material for memes. Humorous images flooded social media platforms, comparing the difference in prices between salted and caramelised popcorn, highlighting the contrasting GST rates in a light-hearted way.The GST Council has recently clarified the taxation of popcorn, taking the internet by storm with a wave of memes and humorous commentary about it.

NEW DELHI: The need to get back to 7-8% growth against the backdrop of global challenges, geopolitical tensions and to ensure that the country remains on track to reach developed nation status by 2047 dominated deliberations at a meeting of economists with PM Modi Tuesday.At pre-Budget consultations under the theme - 'Maintaining India's growth momentum at a time of global uncertainty' - the PM emphasised that the 2047 goal could be achieved with changes in mindset.The PM's remark came in the context of plans needed for grabbing opportunities that may open up for the country in the wake of a possible tariff war between the US and China and how India can benefit and be part of the global value chain.Economists underlined the need to step up growth and offered suggestions on a range of issues, including employment generation , skill development, raising farm productivity, attracting investment and boosting exports.Growth has slumped to a seven-quarter low of 5.4% in the July-Sept quarter of the current financial year, raising alarm among policymakers and triggering calls for a cut in interest rates.The sharp slowdown in growth in the second quarter has also prompted several agencies, including RBI, to revise growth downwards. Sources said a significant part of the meeting saw experts reinforcing the need to step up growth and deepen reforms across sectors, from the farm sector to taxation reforms both on indirect and direct taxes. Economists suggested a range of reforms for the farm sector such as a robust value chain for vegetables including TOP (tomato, onion and potato). Suggestions were also made on strategies to deal with climate change and energy transition.Issues linked to trade and exports were prominently discussed, with experts suggesting several measures including faster conclusion of free trade agreements, a strategy on tariffs and internationalisation of the rupee. For creating jobs, suggestions were made to deepen vocational training and inculcating dignity of labour.An official statement issued after the meeting, which was coordinated by govt think tank Niti Aayog , said participants shared their views on several significant issues including navigating challenges posed by global economic uncertainties and geopolitical tensions, strategies to enhance employment, particularly among youth, and create sustainable job opportunities across sectors, strategies to align education and training programmes with the evolving needs of the job market, enhancing agricultural productivity and creating sustainable rural employment opportunities, attracting private investment and mobilising public funds for infrastructure projects to boost economic growth , creating jobs and promoting financial inclusion, boosting exports and attracting foreign investment.FM Nirmala Sitharaman, Niti Aayog vice chairman Suman Bery, CEO BVR Subrahmanyam, and senior officials of the PMO and finance ministry attended the meeting.

Last night, after wrapping up my work at 3 AM, I ordered my food through Zomato. As the doorbell rang, I stood up to open it. There he was, Shiva Sarkar, the delivery executive, with a warm smile despite the biting cold outside.

But there was something in his eyes. A heaviness, a story untold.

I invited him in, offered him some water, and gently asked if he was okay. What followed left me deeply shaken.

Shiva, barely 20-21 years old, broke down in tears as he shared his story. He had to drop out of school after 8th grade when his father passed away. The weight of responsibility forced him to take up this job to support his family.

His dreams of education, of a carefree youth, were replaced by long nights and the heavy burden of ensuring his sisters could be married next year. I sat there, in awe of his strength. This young man, who should be chasing his aspirations, is instead running against the clock to make ends meet, with a determination that can only be admired.

As we chatted, I couldn't help but think, how many more Shivas are out there? Young boys and girls sacrificing their education, their dreams, their potential, just to keep their families afloat.

Shiva left with a smile and a “Thank you.” But I was left with a storm of emotions. What could we do for them? Could Zomato, a platform so impactful, introduce upskilling programs, scholarships or easy loans for these unsung heroes?

What if these delivery executives could dream again? Could learn skills that open doors to brighter futures while earning a living?

Deepinder Goyal, I love the Zomato app, but can we do more? Can we, as a society, step up for these individuals who quietly carry the weight of the world on their young shoulders?

I have some plans in mind for him and will do my best to help him wherever I can.

P.S. I took his photo with his consent, and he’s fully supportive of any assistance provided.

Santa’s Route: A Christmas eve adventure

One of the most anticipated global events is taking place this Christmas : Santa’s sleigh is soaring across the skies, delivering gifts to children worldwide. Thanks to advanced technology, millions are tracking his flight in real-time, making Santa's journey the most watched flight on the planet!Flight Radar 24, known for tracking planes worldwide, has been the go-to platform for Santa’s annual adventure. Each year, over 50,000 users log in to follow his festive flight. Santa’s sleigh, coded as R3DN053 or SLEI, takes off from the North Pole, traveling westward as he circles the Earth to ensure every child gets their Christmas presents. To track Santa, all users need to do is input ""SANTA1,"" ""HOHOHO,"" or R3DN053 into Flightradar24’s search bar, and the sleigh's location will be updated in real-time.Flightradar24 isn’t the only platform keeping tabs on Santa. NORAD, the North American Aerospace Defense Command, also offers a Santa tracker. It all started in 1955, when a department store misprint led a child to call NORAD’s military command center, seeking Santa. Air Force Colonel Harry Shoup responded by pretending to be Santa, and the tradition of tracking Santa began. Today,NORAD tracks Santa’s every move via its website and mobile app, with a hotline (1-877-HI-NORAD) offering live updates. Google also joins the fun, offering a live tracker through its Santa Tracker, where families can follow Santa's journey and enjoy holiday games.Santa's sleigh, a legendary 9-engine Rangifer tarandus (caribou), is no ordinary aircraft. Registered as HOHOHO (MSN 0001), it is the oldest active airframe in existence, at 1,753 years old. Despite its age, the sleigh was upgraded with a ninth engine to ensure smooth flying, especially during foggy Christmas Eves.The tradition of tracking Santa has become a beloved part of Christmas for over 100,000 children who call NORAD each year to inquire about his whereabouts. Meanwhile, millions more follow Santa’s journey online in nine languages, making it a worldwide holiday spectacle.Santa’s journey begins at the International Date Line in the Pacific Ocean, traveling westward as he visits the South Pacific, New Zealand, and Australia. He then moves through Asia, Japan, and Africa before heading to Western Europe. From there, Santa continues to Canada, the United States, Mexico, and Central and South America. His route, however, is subject to change depending on weather conditions, as reported by NORAD.","Flight Radar 24, known for tracking planes worldwide, has been the go-to platform for Santa’s annual adventure.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.
