"Pilot study finds over half of truck drivers surveyed have poor vision, 57% elevated BP",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pilot-study-finds-over-half-of-truck-drivers-surveyed-have-poor-vision-57-elevated-bp/articleshow/117666375.cms,"NEW DELHI: A pilot project to identify the problems faced by truck drivers and to take corrective steps across six states — Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu — found that over half of them suffered from compromised vision; over 44% had borderline or above Body Mass Index (BMI) and around 57% had elevated blood pressure levels.A total of 50,713 truck drivers were screened under “Project Abhay” in the past one year, which was designed and developed by Centre for Rural Development & Technology (CRDT) of IIT-Delhi in collaboration with Foresight Foundation and was supported by the road transport ministry. Road transport minister Nitin Gadkari released the report on the findings and steps taken to address the issue faced by drivers on Tuesday.As per the report, during screening, about 55.1% of truck drivers were found to have compromised vision, with 53.3% requiring distance vision correction and 46.7% needing near-vision correction. Under the project, drivers were given the spectacles at the site, which ensured 93.7% of them with refractive errors received immediate corrections. “Improved vision among drivers directly reduced the likelihood of road accidents, contributing to safer highways and more efficient logistics operations,” it said.During health screening, it was found that 44.3% of drivers had borderline or above BMI, 57.4% had elevated blood pressure levels, and 18.4% showed borderline or high blood sugar levels. “Drivers were provided with counseling on lifestyle changes, including dietary changes and stress management, with urgent cases referred to for further medical investigation,” the report mentioned.About 33.9% of drivers reported moderate stress, while 2.9% were found to have high stress levels. Under the project, dedicated mental health counseling desks provided guidance and introduced drivers to resources like Tele-MANAS, which provides access to mental health care through a 24x7 tele-mental health service.Speaking at the release of the report, Gadkari said the govt is committed to transforming India’s logistics sector, by enhancing truck drivers’ welfare, promoting sustainable fuels, and integrating advanced safety technologies. He said that govt plans to shift 80% of India’s truck fleet to CNG or LNG to cut logistics costs and reduce environmental impact as well. The minister also said India has only 75 drivers for every 100 trucks, leading to a shortage of 22 lakh drivers. “This lack of manpower contributes to accidents, as India does not have driver shifts like Europe.” He said, around 10,000 deaths are caused by trucks, he said.","A total of 50,713 truck drivers were screened under ‘Project Abhay’ in the past one year.

Twenty cases had been added to the tally over the weekend. The health department's daily surveillance bulletin mentioned that the number of patients on ventilator support declined from 17 the previous day to 13.Biological samples from some of the patients have revealed traces of the bacterium Campylobacter jejuni and norovirus, leading public health experts to suspect these as a possible cause of GBS outbreak.A senior health department official told TOI that 110 water samples collected from different parts of the city had been sent for chemical and biological analysis. ""Of the eight recent samples that tested positive for bacterial contamination, four are from GBS-affected areas in Pune, while three are from Pimpri-Chinchwad,"" the official said.Among the contaminated sources in Pune, one sample was collected from Khadakwasla dam.

Tribunal: Banks can't seize buyers' flats for developer's default,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tribunal-banks-cant-seize-buyers-flats-for-developers-default/articleshow/117664176.cms,"KOLKATA: West Bengal Real Estate Appellate Tribunal has stopped a bank from taking over apartments from nine customers over a loan default by the developer. The decision is seen as a landmark judgment, setting a precedent for protecting home-buyers' interests against banking institutions' recovery proceedings in real estate projects, reports Subhro Niyogi.The apartments are in a New Alipore project, with each worth Rs 1.95 crore to Rs 3.14 crore. They were already in the buyers' possession when the bank threatened to take possession.The tribunal upheld a ruling by West Bengal Real Estate Regulatory Authority (WBRERA), which had ruled in favour of home-buyers. This ruling was challenged by Yes Bank. The tribunal's decision prevents the bank from taking possession of or auctioning the flats to recover loans.The case involved nine complainants, who purchased flats in Ideal Exotica project in New Alipore from Ideal Real Estates between 2021 and 2023. The controversy arose when Yes Bank, which had extended a loan of Rs 320 crore to the developer, tried to take possession of these flats through Debts Recovery Tribunal under SARFAESI Act, which allows banks and financial institutions to recover loans by auctioning borrowers' assets. The flat owners, who had already completed mutations under Kolkata MC norms, had approached WBRERA seeking protection of their rights when Yes Bank obtained an order from Debts Recovery Tribunal, Kolkata. The bank published a notice of taking possession of the nine flats by appointing a receiver so that it could sell them by auction to recover the loan advanced to the promoter.The tribunal cited provisions of RERA, Transfer of Property Act, and Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, to rule that RERA provisions override SARFAESI Act.","West Bengal Real Estate Appellate Tribunal has stopped a bank from taking over apartments from nine customers over a loan default by the developer.

Poll Should the Uniform Civil Code Be Implemented All Over India? No, It Overlooks Cultural and Religious Diversity Yes, It Promotes Equality for All

What is UCC and what is its significance??

UCC criticism

What is the implementation process?

NEW DELHI: Uttarakhand is set to make history on Monday by becoming the first state in post-independence India to implement the Uniform Civil Code (UCC). Chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami will officially launch the UCC portal and issue a notification marking the adoption of the civil code, following the completion of government employee training, mock drills, and dry-run sessions.""The UCC's implementation represents a significant milestone, making the Himalayan state the first in the country to adopt this progressive legislation since independence,"" Dhami said.CM Dhami said that the UCC was drafted after extensive consultations with experts, locals, and representatives from various communities, with the goal of bringing uniformity in society and empowering women.The UCC addresses various societal issues, including marriage, divorce, inheritance, and live-in relationships. Key aspects of the law include the registration of marriages, divorces, and live-in relationships to ensure equal property rights and protect children's rights, with penalties for non-compliance.UCC is a set of laws that aims to standardise personal laws across religions. The move has sparked both support and criticism, with proponents arguing for equality and opponents warning of potential societal divisions.The UCC clarifies legal requirements for marriage, stating that only mentally capable individuals aged 21 (for men) or 18 (for women) who are not already married may enter into a union. Marriages can be performed according to religious customs, but registration will be mandatory to ensure legal recognition.The law also addresses issues related to the creation and cancellation of wills and codicils under testamentary succession. Marriages solemnized before March 26, 2010, or those outside the state will be eligible for registration if legal requirements are met.Opposition leaders have criticized the UCC, arguing that it may lead to societal division along religious lines and might be impractical and overly ambitious.The debate surrounding the UCC extends beyond Uttarakhand, as Article 44 of the Indian Constitution advocates for a uniform civil code across the country. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has referenced the Supreme Court's direction on the need for a common code, stressing that fulfilling the vision of the Constitution's framers remains a national goal.Uttarakhand's implementation of the UCC is likely to set a precedent, with other states potentially following suit. The success of the law's implementation will depend on its ability to balance individual rights and social harmony.As Uttarakhand stands at the forefront of this legal revolution, the coming weeks will offer a clearer picture of how the UCC will be received, both in the state and across India. The state's experience with the UCC will undoubtedly shape the future of personal law reform in the country.Shailesh Bagauli, secretary (home), stated that the government will issue two notifications: one for the implementation of the UCC and another for the rules and regulations, officially launching the UCC in the state.Dhami had promised to implement the UCC if re-elected during the 2022 state polls. After becoming CM, he appointed a five-member committee led by Justice Ranjana Prakash Desai to draft the code, which received feedback from over 2.3 lakh people, representing nearly 10% of Uttarakhand's families.The 740-page draft was presented to the chief minister on February 2, 2024, approved by the cabinet on February 4, tabled in the assembly on February 6, and passed the following day. Governor Lt Gen Gurmit Singh (retd) approved the bill on February 28 and President Droupadi Murmu subsequently signed it on March 11.","UCC is a set of laws that aims to standardise personal laws across religions.

"China still boosting infrastructure, defence positions along LAC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/china-still-boosting-infrastructure-defence-positions-along-lac/articleshow/117656092.cms,"'Any Chinese deviations being raised at appropriate levels'



NEW DELHI: Despite troop disengagement in Depsang and Demchok last Oct and a flurry of top-level diplomatic meetings, there has been no let-up in China’s strengthening of its military positions and infrastructure all along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) stretching from eastern Ladakh to Arunachal Pradesh.“The infrastructure development activities of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) are continuing at multiple locations along the LAC. In the east, for instance, it is happening in Rongto Chu and other valleys,” a defence source told TOI.The strategically-located Yangtse in the crucial Tawang sector of Arunachal Pradesh is also witnessing China work assiduously to offset the tactical advantage India has in the area by controlling the high ground or ridgeline in the plateau for where it can see PLA positions.Apart from new military camps and the concrete road constructed from its Tangwu dual-use Xiaokang border village towards the LAC in the area, the PLA has also upgraded a couple of dirt tracks there to ensure it can “surge” troops in larger numbers if required, the source said.Asked specifically by TOI about China’s continuing infrastructure build-up across Yangtse, an official Army source on Tuesday said both China and India are undertaking infrastructure development “all along the northern borders as per the guidelines enunciated in various agreements and protocols between the two countries”.“Any deviation from the agreements and protocols by the Chinese side, once observed, are being raised at appropriate levels during engagements through various existing mechanisms,” he added.As per satellite imagery analyst @NatureDesai on X, China has been constructing two new roads, including one from Lampug towards Tangwu, during the ongoing winter months across Yangtse to provide alternate connectivity and higher ground to its troops. It will provide the PLA an “unobstructed view of Indian ground lines of communication” in the area, he said.Defence sources, in turn, said the PLA has been focusing on establishing last-mile connectivity across Tawang, Naku La in north Sikkim and a few other areas in the eastern sector.Areas like Yangtse, where the rival troops had clashed in Dec 2022, Asaphila and Subansiri river valley in Arunachal Pradesh, which have been under Indian control for decades, remain major flashpoints between the rival armies.The story of new Chinese roads, bridges, helipads, gun positions and the like coming up is similar in all the three sectors of the 3,488-km LAC, western (Ladakh), central (Uttarakhand, Himachal) and eastern (Sikkim, Arunachal), with PLA troops continuing to be forward deployed with heavy weapon systems in large numbers.Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi, asked earlier this month whether India had agreed to give patrolling rights to the PLA in sensitive areas like Yangtse, had said that all corps commanders have been delegated powers to resolve “minor frictions” related to patrolling and grazing issues so that they do not become “big issues” later, as was then reported by TOI.China is yet to agree to de-escalation and then de-induction of its troops along the LAC after last Oct’s disengagement at the two remaining face-off sites at Depsang and Demchok in eastern Ladakh, which has led to restoration of patrolling by the rival soldiers and grazing by herders as well as reduced the risk of any inadvertent escalation.","Despite troop disengagement in Depsang and Demchok last Oct, there has been no let-up in China’s strengthening of its military positions and infrastructure.

NEW DELHI: The road transport ministry is considering to bring a new rule to make it mandatory for vehicle owners and driving licence (DL) holders to update their address (Aadhaar), mobile phone number and other details, a move aimed at reining in violators going scot-free and evading penalty.Sources said the ministry is considering making it a part of the proposed amendments to the Motor Vehicle Act. “There is a need to have some mechanism to track people who are violating rules, particularly frequent offenders, posing risk to other road users. Changing mobile number and applying for a new DL is the easiest way to evade paying penalty and face action,” an official said.Recently, union road transport secretary V Umashankar gave a hint of the proposed move while speaking at a conference on road safety. He said, “More than Rs 12,000 crore worth of e-challans issued remain unpaid, essentially because the database through which we are enforcing the e-challan system is not good. So, we need to clean up the database and make it more perfect.”Citing that some DLs and vehicle registration certificates (RCs) on Sarathi and Vahan databases may date back to the 1960s and 70s, and the 1980s and 90s respectively. The old databases has no mobile and Aadhaar numbers. “May be the address is not the same, which means we need to think of certain touch points at which it becomes mandatory for vehicle owners or licence holders to update their details,” Umashanakar said.He said this will help agencies to know whom to reach and where to reach, and if an e-challan penalty remains unpaid after a certain time, then RC or DL holder becomes cut off from other service requirements. “May be his insurance goes up, registration gets invalidated, cancelled or suspended,” the secretary said.","The road transport ministry is considering to bring a new rule to make it mandatory for vehicle owners and driving licence (DL) holders to update their details.

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Raul Gandhi held a rally in Delhi on Tuesday, where he took multiple jabs at AAP Supremo Arvind Kejriwal , ahead of the Delhi elections to be held on February 5.Addressing the gathering at Patparganj, Rahul accused Kejriwal of not helping the poor and vanishing in times of need of the people. ""Kejriwal says anything that comes to his mind, when he came, he had a small car and had said that he will do a new kind of politics.

So this is the truth.""Then, calling for support to Congress' Patparganj candidate and calling out Manish Sisodia for his ""involvement"" in the liquor scam, Rahul said, ""Before, Manish Sisodia ji was the candidate here, who was the architect of the liquor scam.

It is nowhere written in the Constitution that a single billionaire should have all the wealth of the country. Their aim is only to spread fear,"" he further said. Rahul Gandhi also emphasised the minimal involvement of Dalits, backward communities and tribal groups in budget fund allocation decisions, attributing this to their limited representation in crucial sectors.Gandhi called attention to PM Modi's non-response regarding the Congress' caste census demand and affirmed that wherever Congress forms the government, they would implement a nationwide caste census.

Scientists find signs of Earth's crust peeling away beneath California,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/scientists-find-signs-of-earths-crust-peeling-away-beneath-california/articleshow/117654297.cms,"In a big geological discovery , scientists have found signs of portions of the Earth's crust peeling away and sinking into the mantle. This geological churning is happening beneath California's Sierra Nevada mountains . The phenomenon has been happening for millions of years and could shed a new light on how the continents are formed.Geologists used nearly four decades of seismic data from stations encompassing the northern, central and southern Sierra Nevada along California's eastern border to uncover signs of a critical separation between the cool continental crust and mantle below.The findings – made by researchers Vera Schulte-Pelkum from the University of Colorado Boulder and Deborah Kilb from the University of California San Diego – help resolve a mystery on how our planet generates lighter portions of its crust from the dense mix of minerals churning beneath.In a study published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, researchers stated that this process, called differentiation, happens when the dense layers of the Earth’s crust sink and get absorbed into the mantle, leaving the lighter layers behind.“Our observations provide progressive snapshots of a lithospheric foundering process spanning several million years and hundreds of kilometres, illuminating a fundamental differentiation process by which continents are built,"" the researchers noted in the paper.Scientists have traced this peeling process beneath the Sierra Nevada using advanced imaging techniques. The southern section of the mountain range shows evidence of dense material that sank into the mantle millions of years ago. In the central region, the process is still ongoing, as indicated by small, deep earthquakes occurring beneath the surface.The northern part of Sierra Nevada still retains its dense layer, making it a snapshot of an earlier stage in this geological cycle.

No, It May Overlook Regional Needs Yes, It Will Boost Unity And Efficiency

Is it ready to go live?

What is an Atomic Clock?

What are the benefits of the project?

How will the transition happen?

NEW DELHI: The country may be on Indian Standard Time (IST), but the exact time is determined by GPS satellites , down to the millisecond, and is linked to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).In the next few months this is set to change with Navigation with Indian Constellation (NavIC) being the link to National Physical Laboratory to provide the reference time. A lab in Faridabad will receive the time from NavIC which will be shared through an optic fibre link with four other centres - Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Bhubaneswar and Guwahati - with each having an atomic clock .The deployment of atomic clocks will ensure the time shown on digital watches, smartphones and laptops is based on the atomic clocks instead of service providers accessing data from multiple sources linked to GPS. Soon, the regional centres will disseminate the time to all end users - resulting in ""one nation, one time"".The satellite system was conceived soon after the Kargil war, when India could not get the exact location of targets from foreign satellites. Govt realised that strategic importance and finally got moving on the project around seven years ago.Consumer affairs secretary Nidhi Khare said most of the work for the Times Dissemination Project has been completed with atomic clocks installed in Faridabad, Ahmedabad, Bengaluru and Bhubaneswar. A few months ago, the NavIC link with NPL Faridabad was tested. The department, which is working with NPL and Isro to disseminate IST with millisecond to microsecond accuracy, will have to align the clocks in four centres with Faridabad to adjust for the time taken for sharing the data through the optic fibre cable.An atomic clock is a clock known for its exceptional accuracy, and functions by utilising specific resonance frequencies of atoms. The extreme precision levels of the atomic clocks can be interpreted by the fact that they will lose one second every 100 million years or so.Former consumer affairs secretary Rohit Kumar Singh said it will establish India's own precise and reliable time distribution network, reducing dependence on foreign systems and enhancing national security. ""It will benefit critical sectors like power grids, telecommunications, banking, defence, and transportation by ensuring synchronised operations, efficiency, and resilience against cyber threats,"" he said.While technical work is underway, the consumer affairs department has notified the draft rules, mandating the use of IST as the sole time reference for legal, administrative, commercial, and official documents across the country.Exceptions will be allowed for specialised fields such as astronomy, navigation, and scientific research, subject to prior govt approval with violations attracting penalty.","Atomic clocks will ensure the time shown on digital watches, smartphones and laptops is based on the atomic clocks.

In 1973, an SC bench in Kesavananda Bharti judgment had by a narrow margin devised the 'basic structure theory' to demarcate the unamendable part of the Constitution, a ruling that went against the intents of Indira Gandhi and in which Justice H R Khanna had tilted the balance for the majority view.It was followed by the ADM Jabalpur case ruling, in which Justice Khanna Sr had penned the lone dissent to rule Emergency powers could not extinguish the right to life, which he said was inherent to a nation's existence. The CJI said, ""In the initial years, SC had interpreted all fundamental rights as rights working in exclusive silos. This judicial attitude, however, underwent a significant change after the Emergency was imposed in 1975."" He said the court in 1978 in the Maneka Gandhi case had ruled Articles 14, 19 and 21 were not mutually exclusive and had to be read together.He said Constitution created a strong centre but advocated a balanced federal structure, a characteristic of governance which a nine-judge bench in S R Bommai case had termed as a basic feature of the Constitution. ""Bommai (judgment) also has implications for the secular fabric of India. SC had also ruled that secularism is a basic feature of the Constitution.""Supreme Court Bar Association president Kapil Sibal said SC must champion the Constitution, especially when confronted with challenges to constitutional values that are creating serious problems.

""The last two decades of the 21st century stand as a testament to the SC's evolving role in our constitutional framework.""

ASER: Government school enrolment down to 67% in rural India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/aser-government-school-enrolment-down-to-67-in-rural-india/articleshow/117656530.cms,"Boys outshine girls in digi skills: Report



NEW DELHI: Government school enrolment for children aged 6-14 has declined sharply from 72.9% in 2022 to 66.8% in 2024, as per the 'Annual Status of Education Report (Rural) 2024' released Tuesday. While overall enrolment for this age group remains high at 98.1%, the drop in govt school share signals a post-pandemic shift toward private institutions. During Covid, economic pressures pushed families to opt for govt schools, temporarily boosting enrolment, but the trend has now reverted to pre-pandemic levels of 66-67%.The proportion of out-of-school adolescents aged 15-16 has steadily decreased, from 13.1% in 2018 to 7.5% in 2024. However, learning gaps persist in higher grades. Among Class 8 students, only ""45.8% are able to perform basic arithmetic in 2024"", unchanged in recent years.Private school students have also shown no significant progress since 2022, highlighting systemic challenges in improving learning outcomes. Experts stress state govts must prioritise basic maths performance in higher grades. Conducted by Pratham, the survey covered 605 rural districts, 17,997 villages, and almost 6.5 lakh children. The report also highlights a post-Covid surge in digital awareness and smartphone usage among children.Over 90% of households with young people now own smartphones, and more than 80% of children aged 14-16 know how to use them. Yet, only 57% use them for educational purposes. Among this group, ""36.2% of boys and 26.9% of girls own smartphones"", revealing a gender gap in digital access.""Boys outperform girls across most states in digital skills,"" the report states, though states like Kerala and Karnataka buck the trend, where ""girls often match or outperform boys"". Gender inequality in digital literacy remains a pressing issue.Infrastructure remains a challenge in many regions. States like Meghalaya, Arunachal Pradesh and Nagaland lag in providing usable toilets and drinking water. ""Only 72% schools have usable girls' toilets, up from 66.4% in 2018"", while 77.7% have drinking water. Sports facilities show little progress, with ""just 66.2% of schools having playgrounds in 2024"", a slight dip from 66.5% in 2018. These deficits highlight inadequate investment in school infrastructure.Despite challenges, there is progress in foundational learning for lower grades. The proportion of Class 3 students in govt schools who can read a Class 2-level text ""increased from 16.3% in 2022 to 23.4% in 2024"". Similarly, arithmetic proficiency improved, with '27.6% of Class 3 students in govt schools able to solve a subtraction problem"", up from 20.2% in 2022. These gains reflect the success of foundational literacy and numeracy programmes, supported by teacher training and learning materials.Pre-primary education has seen significant progress, with ""enrolment among children aged 3-5 years steadily increasing"". States like Gujarat, Maharashtra and Odisha report near-universal enrolment for this age group. The proportion of underage children enrolled in Class 1 ""dropped from 25.6% in 2018 to 16.7% in 2024"", ensuring age-appropriate admissions. These improvements highlight the impact of targeted early childhood education policies.Better attendance rates in govt schools underscore further progress. ""Teacher attendance rose to 87.5% in 2024 from 85.1% in 2018"", and student attendance ""increased to 75.9% from 72.4%"". Efforts to improve access in remote areas are evident, with ""52.1% of govt primary schools now having fewer than 60 students"", reflecting outreach in sparsely populated regions.Localised successes are notable in states like Punjab and Jammu & Kashmir, where enrolment in govt pre-primary schools has surged. Digital literacy among children aged 14-16 has also improved, with ""over 75% successfully completing tasks like setting alarms, browsing for information, and sharing content via messaging platforms"".While the report highlights these advancements, it emphasises the need to address persistent issues, such as learning gaps in higher grades, gender inequality in digital access, and inadequate infrastructure. Sustained efforts in these areas will be crucial for equitable and quality education across rural India.","Government school enrolment for children aged 6-14 has declined sharply from 72.9% in 2022 to 66.8% in 2024.

'Foolproof': What EC said on EVM tampering allegations



'Why does he want it?' EC over blocking public access of CCTV footage of poll booths



NEW DELHI: Election Commission of India on Tuesday addressed concerns regarding wrongful additions and deletions of voters in the electoral roll and said that the allegations regarding the rigging Electronic Voting Machines were ""baseless.""Setting a poetic tone, the chief election commissioner Rajiv Kumar began with a shayari: ""All questions hold importance; answers must follow; out of habit, we kept giving written replies, but today, face-to-face feels necessary; who knows if tomorrow will come or not, today, an answer is due).""The CEC, before announcing the dates of Delhi assembly elections, took the opportunity to offer clarifications on allegations, including EVM tampering , erratic changes in voter list and recent changes in rules by the poll body to prevent public inspection of certain electronic documents.Kumar refuted claims of manipulation in the electoral roll, categorically mentioning that no deletion is made without proper documentation, field verification, and providing the individual an opportunity to be heard.On addition of names to the electoral roll, Kumar said, ""Regular meetings are held with the representatives of political parties, who have the right to appoint booth-level agents (BLAs). Weekly lists of claims and objections are shared, and both draft and final rolls are published on the Election Commission's website. Polling station rationalisation is also carried out with the consultation of all the stakeholders.""Regarding deletion of names from the list, he said, ""Mandatory field verification is conducted by the BLOs, and in cases where deletions exceed 2 per cent of a polling station's voter list, cross-verification is done. Deletions due to death require a certified death certificate, and a seven-day window is provided for objections after notices are published online. Also, the affected voters are given the opportunity for a personal hearing before their names are removed.""""Where every vote matters, raising doubts about deletion of thousands of names without evidence is misleading. The processes we follow leave no room for manipulation,"" he said.He added that political parties were involved at each and every stage of voter list preparation with full disclosure and opportunity to object.CEC said that it was not possible to change the voter turnout and said that it was ""misleading to compare final VTR with 5pm data.""""...It is impossible to change voter turnout...Some polling parties report at midnight or the next day. Form 17C is matched before counting. There is nothing which VTR does not explain. It explains fully,"" he said.Addressing the EVM issue, CEC said, ""There is no evidence of unreliability or any drawback in the EVM... There is no question of introducing a virus or bug in the EVM. There is no question of invalid votes in the EVM. No rigging is possible. High courts and the Supreme Court are continuously saying this in different judgments... What else can be said? EVMs are foolproof devices for counting. Allegations of tampering are baseless. We are speaking now because we don't speak when elections are on.""Kumar also cited court rulings at multiple occasions and said that ""courts have ruled on 42 occasions that EVMs are not hackable, allegations of tampering totally baseless.""""This is aimed at derailing the electoral process,"" he added.Further, he said that no discrepancies had been found between votes counted through Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) and Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) slips,"" he said.""Let me tell the nation today. After the Supreme Court mandated in 2019 that five VVPATs must be counted from each assembly constituency, over 67,000 VVPATs have been checked. ""This translates to more than 4.5 crore (VVPAT) slips being verified. And let me assure you that not even the difference of one vote has been found with the new machines since 2019,"" he added.Kumar defended the recent amendment to election rules restricting public access to CCTV footage from polling booths, citing the need to safeguard voter privacy and prevent misuse of data to create false narratives.""Why does he want it? Let us ask this question from the person who wants it,"" Kumar asked as he addressed the reason why the poll body had decided to block public access to CCTV footages of poll booths.The CEC explained that the poll authority has evidence showing how such data could be exploited for machine learning and AI to craft deceptive narratives. He cautioned that even fact-checkers might struggle to distinguish between genuine and AI-generated videos of polling stations.The government, acting on the Election Commission's recommendation, amended the rules last month to limit public inspection of certain electronic documents, including polling station CCTV footage, to prevent potential abuse.This comes amidst the opposition raising concerns regarding irregularities in electoral processes, with AAP national convenor Arvind Kejriwal recently accusing BJP of tampering with voters' lists in Delhi. The former CM had alleged that there was an ""unusual increase"" in voter list modifications, including both removals and additions, specifically in New Delhi constituency.Congress had also raised similar concerns during Maharashtra and Haryana assembly elections, with Mallikarjun Kharge demanding ballot papers instead of EVMs.Assembly elections in Delhi are set to take place in a single phase on February 5. Votes would be counted on February 8.","The Election Commission of India addressed concerns regarding wrongful additions and deletions of voters in the electoral roll.

(AI image for representation)

Poll Is DeepSeek's AI Technology Superior to Other Available AI Tools? No, It Still Has a Long Way to Go Yes, It’s a Game Changer

Why it matters

DeepSeek’s success challenges the prevailing belief that AI dominance depends on massive financial investments and cutting-edge technology. By developing its latest model using Nvidia’s less advanced H800 chips, DeepSeek bypassed US export restrictions and delivered an AI system that rivals offerings from companies like OpenAI and Google at a fraction of the cost.

This raises critical questions: Is the US strategy of pouring billions into AI infrastructure sustainable?

Is the US strategy of pouring billions into AI infrastructure sustainable? Can the multibillion-dollar valuations of US tech companies like Nvidia and Microsoft be justified in light of such efficient alternatives?

Are US sanctions on China’s access to advanced chips like Nvidia’s H100 truly effective?

The Nasdaq’s dramatic selloff underscores how vulnerable the market remains to shifts in the AI narrative. As DeepSeek demonstrates, innovation doesn’t always require the most expensive tools.

The geopolitical implications of DeepSeek ’s success are profound. For years, US policymakers have sought to curtail China’s technological ambitions through export controls and sanctions. However, DeepSeek’s rise suggests that these measures may be insufficient to halt China’s progress in AI. By developing competitive models with limited resources, China has signaled its ability to challenge US dominance in a field considered critical to future economic and strategic power.

’s success are profound. For years, US policymakers have sought to curtail China’s technological ambitions through export controls and sanctions. However, DeepSeek’s rise suggests that these measures may be insufficient to halt China’s progress in AI. By developing competitive models with limited resources, China has signaled its ability to challenge US dominance in a field considered critical to future economic and strategic power. Gregory Allen, director of the Wadhwani AI Center at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, pointed out the political significance of DeepSeek’s timing. “The technology innovation is real, but the timing of the release is political in nature,” he said, comparing it to other high-profile Chinese tech launches that coincided with diplomatic tensions.

The big picture: The disruptor from China

DeepSeek’s rise has upended conventional wisdom about AI development. Founded in 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, a hedge fund manager, the Hangzhou-based startup leverages bespoke algorithms and open-source principles. The company developed its latest model, R1, for just $5.6 million—a stark contrast to the hundreds of millions that US firms like OpenAI spend to train comparable models.

DeepSeek’s innovative approach involved using reduced-capability Nvidia H800 chips to train its AI systems. These chips, designed for the Chinese market to comply with US export controls, were thought to be less capable than the H100 chips used by American firms. Despite this limitation, DeepSeek’s R1 model outperformed rivals, including OpenAI’s o1-mini, across several benchmarks.

Last month, DeepSeek drew significant attention in the AI industry by releasing a new AI model it claimed was comparable to offerings from US firms like OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT. This model was also touted as more cost-efficient in its use of Nvidia chips to train on massive datasets. The chatbot became more accessible after launching on Apple and Google app stores earlier this year.

However, the real stir began with a follow-up research paper published last week — coinciding with President Donald Trump ’s inauguration anniversary. The paper detailed a new DeepSeek AI model called R1, which demonstrated advanced “reasoning” capabilities, such as rethinking approaches to math problems, and was significantly cheaper than OpenAI’s comparable model, o1.

’s inauguration anniversary. The paper detailed a new DeepSeek AI model called R1, which demonstrated advanced “reasoning” capabilities, such as rethinking approaches to math problems, and was significantly cheaper than OpenAI’s comparable model, o1. “What their economics look like, I have no idea,” Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon told AP. “But I think the price points freaked people out.”

This development calls into question the efficacy of US sanctions designed to curtail China’s progress in AI. If China can achieve such breakthroughs with limited access to advanced technology, the broader implications for US tech dominance and national security are significant.

Trump calls China’s AI DeepSeek breakthrough ‘a wakeup call’ — but ‘positive’ if true

What they are saying

Prominent voices across tech, politics, and finance have weighed in on the implications of DeepSeek’s success:

Marc Andreessen, US venture capitalist, likened the development to the Soviet Union’s 1957 launch of Sputnik: ""This is AI's ‘Sputnik moment,’ showcasing how China has narrowed the AI gap faster than expected.""

Donald Trump, US President, echoed the competitive urgency, stating, ""The release of DeepSeek’s AI should be a wake-up call for our industries that we need to be laser-focused on competing to win."" He praised the cost efficiency of DeepSeek’s approach, framing it as a challenge that US companies must rise to meet.

Liang Wenfeng, DeepSeek CEO, expressed a vision of democratized AI: ""AI should be affordable and accessible to everyone.""

Deepseek's r1 is an impressive model, particularly around what they're able to deliver for the price. We will obviously deliver much better models and also it's legit invigorating to have a new competitor! we will pull up some releases. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI

Gone in a day: $1 trillion

The market reaction to DeepSeek’s announcement was swift and brutal. Nvidia shares plunged 17%, wiping out nearly $600 billion in value. Alphabet lost 4%, and Microsoft dropped 2.1%, highlighting the tech sector’s vulnerability to disruption. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index fell 9.2%, its steepest drop since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic.

The selloff also spilled into global markets: European chipmaker ASML saw a 7% drop.

In Japan, SoftBank, which has heavily invested in AI, tumbled 8.3%.

Energy firms like Constellation Energy, banking on AI-driven demand for power, suffered losses of over 20%.

Richard Hunter of Interactive Investor summed up the market’s anxiety: ""It will almost certainly put the cat among the pigeons as investors scramble to assess the potential damage it could have on a burgeoning industry.""

Between the lines

What’s next

A seismic shift in the global AI landscape rattled stock markets on Monday, as the Chinese startup DeepSeek unveiled a game-changing AI model. The company’s low-cost and high-performing technology sent shockwaves through Wall Street, erasing $1 trillion from the Nasdaq’s market value and sparking fears about the sustainability of the US-dominated AI boom.Nvidia, the US chipmaker at the heart of AI infrastructure, suffered the largest one-day market cap loss in history, shedding nearly $600 billion in value. The Nasdaq Composite fell 3.1%, with Google’s parent company Alphabet losing $100 billion and Microsoft dropping $7 billion. The development marks a pivotal moment in the race between the US and China for AI supremacy.DeepSeek’s success could ignite a price war in the AI market, forcing competitors to reassess their business models. OpenAI, which has heavily invested in costly infrastructure, may face pressure to lower prices—a move that could strain its finances further.Some analysts, however, remain skeptical about DeepSeek’s claims. Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein noted, ""While DeepSeek’s pricing blows away the competition, the notion that they achieved this for $5.6 million seems overly optimistic. Hidden costs likely exist.""Nevertheless, DeepSeek’s open-source approach has earned praise for its potential to democratize AI access. Dr.Andrew Duncan of the UK’s Alan Turing Institute remarked, ""It demonstrates that you can do amazing things with relatively small models and resources.""The emergence of DeepSeek comes at a critical time for US tech giants, with companies like Apple and Microsoft set to report earnings this week. Investors will be watching closely for signs of how these firms plan to navigate a more competitive AI landscape.At the same time, the broader geopolitical implications are profound. DeepSeek’s rise highlights the diminishing returns of US export controls. If China can produce world-class AI models without access to advanced hardware, the US may need to rethink its approach to maintaining technological leadership.Trump has already signaled his administration’s intent to tighten restrictions further, calling for the elimination of loopholes in existing export controls. However, some experts, like Gregory Allen of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, believe the timing of DeepSeek’s announcement may have been politically motivated to undermine US policies.(With inputs from agencies)","DeepSeek’s success challenges the prevailing belief that AI dominance depends on massive financial investments and cutting-edge technology. The company developed its latest model, the R1, for just $5.6 million, a stark contrast to the hundreds of millions that US firms like OpenAI spend to train comparable models.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117616666,imgsize-1373856,width-400,resizemode-4/117616666.jpg"
Bill Gates News: Bill Gates admits he regrets divorcing Melinda the most: 'It was miserable for me...',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/bill-gates-admits-he-regrets-divorcing-melinda-the-most-it-was-miserable-for-me-/articleshow/117563747.cms,"Bill Gates and Melinda split up in 2021 after 27 years of marriage.

Poll Is Co-Parenting Effectively Possible After Divorce? No, It’s Often Challenging Yes, With Mutual Effort

Bill Gates said divorcing Melinda after 27 years of marriage will always be the thing that he regrets the most in his life. In an interview with the Times of London, he said though he is more cheerful now, the divorce thing was miserable for both him and Melinda for at least two years and this will remain on the top of the chart of his regrets. “Melinda and I still see each other — we have three kids and two grandchildren so there are family events. The kids are doing well. They have good values,” Bill said.Bill Gates,69, is now dating Paula Hurd, 62, the widow of Oracle CEO Mark Hudd. Melinda, 60, has also moved on with her new boyfriend, entrepreneur Philip Vaughn.""When Melinda and I met, I was fairly successful but not ridiculously successful — that came during the time that we were together. So, she saw me through a lot. When we got divorced it was tough and then she made the decision to leave the foundation — I was disappointed that she took the option to go off,"" Bill Gates said.Bill and Melinda were married in 1994 and have three kids Jennifer, 28, Rory, 25 and Phoebe, 22. They announced their split in May 2021 and said that they had been living separately for a year. Bill earlier admitted that he caused pain when she confronted him about a report that he'd had an affair with a Microsoft employee. “I certainly made mistakes, and I take responsibility,” he replied, adding, “I don’t think delving into the particulars at this point is constructive, but yes, I caused pain, and I feel terrible about that.”Another factor behind their separation was Bill's connections to Jeffrey Epstein. “I did not like that he had meetings with Jeffrey Epstein, no. I made that clear to him,” Melinda said in an interview. “He was abhorrent. He was evil personified.” Bill has called his working relationship with Epstein, who died by suicide in jail in August 2019 while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges, a “mistake.”","Bill and Melinda were married in 1994 and have three kids Jennifer, 28, Rory, 25 and Phoebe, 22.

Global repercussions



Accusations and scepticism

Wall Street faced a major shock on Monday as Chinese AI startup DeepSeek emerged as a formidable competitor, triggering a sell-off in US tech stocks . NVIDIA , one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI boom, saw its stock plunge by almost 17%, closing at $118.58 . This came after DeepSeek, a Chinese startup founded in 2023, announced its latest AI model, R1, which reportedly matches US-developed models like OpenAI’s ChatGPT at a fraction of the cost.The news unsettled investors, who fear that such advancements could disrupt the lucrative AI supply chain that has driven Silicon Valley’s growth. “This is AI’s Sputnik moment,” venture capitalist Marc Andreessen told news agency AP.The impact was immediate and widespread. The S&P 500 dipped 1.7%, with tech stocks suffering the brunt of the losses. Shares of Microsoft and Meta Platforms, both heavily invested in AI infrastructure, saw sharp declines, while bond yields fell as investors sought safer assets.The Nasdaq Composite fell 3.1% on Monday, dragged down by sharp losses in Big Tech, including Nvidia’s 17% plunge. The S&P 500 dropped 1.5%, its worst day in over a month, while utilities linked to AI data centres also slumped. In contrast, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.7%, as stocks outside AI-related industries held steady amidst the turmoil sparked by DeepSeek’s announcement of a cost-efficient AI model.DeepSeek gained international attention after its AI assistant app climbed to the top of Apple’s free app chart in the US over the weekend. The company claims its R1 model demonstrates advanced reasoning abilities, similar to OpenAI’s most expensive systems, but at a fraction of the cost. Analysts have noted that DeepSeek may have bypassed US-imposed restrictions on accessing NVIDIA’s cutting-edge chips, a claim that remains under scrutiny.Gregory Allen of the Center for Strategic and International Studies said, “The timing of DeepSeek’s release is strategic, potentially undermining US efforts to maintain technological dominance through export controls.”NVIDIA’s dramatic 17% slump highlights growing investor fears that the AI gold rush, which had propelled the company to a trillion-dollar valuation, could be under threat. The company’s stock had soared from under $20 to over $140 in just two years, fuelled by explosive demand for AI chips.“This news questions the economics of AI investments,” said analyst Kathleen Brooks of XTB. “If China can produce comparable models so cheaply, US tech giants may need to reassess their strategies.”DeepSeek’s announcement also rattled international markets. Dutch semiconductor equipment maker ASML saw its shares drop 7%, while Japan’s SoftBank fell 8.3%. In the US, Constellation Energy shares plummeted nearly 20% after the company announced plans to restart a nuclear plant to power AI data centres.Amid the panic, industry figures like Elon Musk have raised suspicions that DeepSeek may have secretly accessed banned Nvidia H100 chips. However, Hong Kong-based investor Jen Zhu Scott dismissed these claims, stating, “It sounds like a rich kids’ team got outplayed by a poor kids’ team.”Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon remained cautious, saying, “DeepSeek’s models are impressive but not miraculous. The market reaction appears overblown.”","Nasdaq drops 3.1% as AI-driven sell-off hits big tech. S&P 500 drops 1.5%, its worst day in over a month.

Trump Reacts To DeepSeek Rocking Stock Market, AI Industry

Why is it being seen as a threat by US?



US President Donald Trump has warned against the low-cost Chinese AI tool DeepSeek, calling it a ""wake up call"" for America after it gave a huge shock to tech stocks at Wall Street on Monday.""Hopefully, the release of DeepSeek AI from a Chinese company should be a wake up call for our industries that we need to be laser-focused on competing to win,"" Trump told a Republican congressional retreat.Trump, however, suggested that the shock to Silicon Valley could ultimately have a positive effect by encouraging more cost-effective innovation.""I would say that could be a positive,"" he said. ""So instead of spending billions and billions, you'll spend less, and you'll come up with hopefully the same solution.""DeepSeek is a Chinese tech startup founded by Liang Wenfeng that has developed several competitive AI models over the past year, gaining some industry attention. It is headquartered in Hangzhou. DeepSeek's version 3 was developed at just $5.6 million.Its V3 model, in particular, brought the company into the spotlight. However, according to The Wall Street Journal, the model's content restrictions on sensitive topics related to the Chinese government and its leadership have raised questions about its potential to compete effectively in the global market.Further, the R1 model was officially launched last week and gained considerable attention this week after the company disclosed to The Wall Street Journal its remarkably low operating costs.The startup has demonstrated the potential to rival leading US AI companies, achieving comparable results with a fraction of the investment made by American firms.The R1 model is reported to rival US-developed models, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, while operating at a fraction of the cost.The news rattled investors, raising concerns about potential disruptions to the lucrative AI supply chain that has fueled Silicon Valley's growth. The effects were swift and far-reaching, with the S&P 500 dropping 1.7%, led by steep losses in tech stocks. Companies heavily invested in AI infrastructure, such as Microsoft and Meta Platforms, experienced significant declines, while bond yields fell as investors shifted toward safer assets.","US President Donald Trump has warned against the low-cost Chinese AI tool DeepSeek.

Poll Should Loan Waivers Be Limited To The Needy? No, Loan Waivers Should Be Available To All Yes, They Should Focus On Supporting The Underprivileged

NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party supremo Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, urging the Centre to prioritise waiving loans for farmers and the middle class instead of benefitting wealthy individuals.According to ANI news agency, Kejriwal in his letter said, “The Prime Minister should declare that no rich person’s loan will be waived off. If you want to waive off, then waive off farmers’ loans, middle class’s home loans. This money will benefit the middle class a lot.”He further pointed out the potential financial relief for taxpayers if loans for the wealthy were not forgiven. “I have calculated that if loans are not waived off, then tax rates will be halved. A person earning 12 lakhs annually pays his entire salary in tax, this is the sorrow of the middle class,” Kejriwal stated.Meanwhile, ahead of the Delhi assembly polls , AAP has unveiled a new strategy aimed at solidifying its traditional slum vote bank , a key support base for the party.With both the BJP and Congress striving to attract this demographic of the national capital, AAP has devised a campaign to reinforce its connection with slum dwellers.According to AAP sources, “We have seen in the last few days how BJP is trying hard to get the votes of slums towards itself. Therefore, now we have prepared a plan to retain the votes of slums through our campaign as well as the people of slums.”The plan focuses on mobilising educated youth from slum areas who already have strong community influence. Many of these youths, having studied in Delhi government schools, are now trained to communicate the advantages of AAP’s schemes to slum residents.“Through them, we are giving the message to the common slum dwellers that how the Aam Aadmi Party government has worked for their benefit, whether it is free electricity and water, free education, health, construction of lanes and sewers in slums or the schemes coming in the new government,” the party sources added.","Aam Aadmi Party supremo Arvind Kejriwal wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Ever wonder if a college degree is the secret to billions? The world's richest people broke not only the bank but also quite some interesting educational paths. Here are the educational journeys of elite Ivy League dropouts and people who followed rather odd routes to great wealth.Did Jeff Bezos dream of e-commerce while studying engineering? What did Elon Musk learn before targeting Mars? Does Bill Gates regret leaving Harvard? Their answers might shock you! Whether they earned fancy diplomas or dropped class to join startups, these 10 billionaires show that the road to riches is as varied as it is inspiring. So get ready to dive into their educational stories.Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla Motors, attended Queen's University in Canada but would later move to the United States to attend the University of Pennsylvania to pursue degrees in business and physics. His desire was thus fulfilled where he could be more entrepreneurial and up-to-date with the world of technology. His quest for deeper knowledge led him to Stanford University in California to pursue a PhD in energy physics. However, after being at Stanford for only two days, he decided to pursue his entrepreneurial pursuits and left college. Although Musk never completed that program, this educational background largely molded his revolutionary ideas in matters related to technology and business.Jeff Bezos, the founder and executive chairman of Amazon, graduated from Princeton University, where he earned degrees in electrical engineering and computer science. His time at Princeton was pivotal in shaping his future, as the knowledge he gained in these fields laid the groundwork for his innovative work in technology and e-commerce. With a strong foundation in both engineering and computer science, Bezos combined technical expertise with a visionary mindset to revolutionize the retail industry. He founded Amazon, which is today the global powerhouse it is.Larry Ellison initially started as a pre-med student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign but later left before completion of his studies. He thereafter enrolled in the University of Chicago where he majored in physics and mathematics. But he did not graduate. Even though he dropped out from both high school and the University of Illinois early in his academic life, Ellison had become passionate about technology and innovation, which led to co-founding Oracle as it revolutionized the soft-ware industry. It is an enlightening reminder of how educational pathways are not the definitive route to success; rather, passion sometimes leads to incredible feats.Mark Zuckerberg first went to Harvard University to study psychology and computer science. Yet, after only two years, he quit college and took up the entrepreneurial career to pursue his goals. Focusing on Facebook was much more important to him than any college where he might have spent most of his time developing the social media platform that would change the course of connectivity among online users. Although he did not graduate from Harvard, dropping out marked the beginning of an incredible journey that made him one of the most influential figures in the tech world and one of the wealthiest individuals in the world.Bernard Arnault is the man behind the LVMH empire, which comprises brands such as Louis Vuitton and cosmetics giant Sephora. He graduated from École Polytechnique in Paris with a Bachelor of Arts and Science. This institution formed the basis for Arnault's incredible journey into the world of high-end fashion and cosmetics. His education was well-equipped with the analytical skills and business acumen that would later help him build one of the most influential luxury conglomerates in the world. Arnault's success story shows how a strong academic background can blend with entrepreneurial vision to create global dominance.Larry Page, the co-founder of Google, graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in computer engineering from the University of Michigan. While studying at Michigan, he established a strong background in computer science that eventually made him interested in search engine technology. Page later continued his studies for a PhD in computer science at Stanford University, where he met Sergey Brin. Together, they worked on a research project that eventually became Google. Page left his PhD program to focus on developing Google, but his academic background played a crucial role in shaping the innovative approach that led to the creation of one of the world's most successful tech companies.Sergey Brin graduated with honors from the University of Maryland, College Park, with a Bachelor's degree in mathematics and computer science. He later acquired his Master's degree in computer science from Stanford University. At this time, he was awarded a National Science Foundation Graduate Fellowship, an award that recognizes potential to grow into new talent in technology. This is where Larry Page came into his life, and he and Page started on a journeythat transformed the tech industry itself, making him the man behind Google, the world's leading search engine.Warren Buffett studied business at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln, graduating with a Bachelor of Science in Economics in 1950. After that, he studied economics at Columbia Business School, earning a Master of Science in Economics in 1951. At Columbia, he was under the mentorship of Benjamin Graham, one of the most important economists and investors, whose value investing principles Buffett used to great effect in his investment strategies.Steve Ballmer graduated from Harvard University in 1977, earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in Applied Mathematics and Economics. He later attended Stanford Graduate School of Business, graduating with an MBA in 1980. His academic exposure to applied mathematics, economics, and business paved the way for his professional life at Microsoft. After joining the company in 1980, he became very close to Bill Gates, eventually taking on the position of CEO from 2000-2014 and steering the company through growth that turned it into one of the world's most valuable tech companies.The founder and CEO of NVIDIA, Jensen Huang, has impressive academic credentials. He earned his Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from Oregon State University. He further went on to obtain his Master's degree in Electrical Engineering at Stanford University. Huang's education in electrical engineering laid a foundation for his future career in technology and semiconductor industries. In 1993, he founded NVIDIA which he co-founded and made a leader in graphics processing units and AI technology that creates innovations in gaming, data centers, and artificial intelligence.","Elon Musk attended Queen's University in Canada but would later move to the U.S. to attend the University of Pennsylvania to pursue degrees in business and physics.

Budget 2025 income tax expectations : Ever since the last Union Budget was presented in July 2024, the world has seen significant changes ranging from various elections, global economic slowdown, geopolitical developments, volatile Indian stock markets, etc. Having witnessed all of this, the common man awaits with eager anticipation from the Hon'ble Finance Minister as she gears up to unveil her eighth straight budget. Some of the key expectations that individual taxpayers may have are discussed below.It is anticipated that with the thrust of the Government on the adoption of the new tax regime, there may be no changes to the old tax regime. The basic tax exemption limit under the new tax regime is currently at Rs 3 lakh. It is hoped that this limit may be increased to Rs 5 lakh, providing more disposable income for individuals to either spend or save, thereby boosting the overall economy.The full rebate of tax is available up to income limit of Rs 7 lakh currently under the new tax regime. It is expected that this limit can be raised to Rs 10 lakh, offering relief to middle income taxpayers and making it easier for them to manage their finances.Also Read | Budget 2025 income tax: Top tax reliefs FM Sitharaman should consider in Union Budget To protect salaried taxpayers, there is a case in point to increase the standard deduction under the new regime from the current Rs 75,000 to Rs 1,00,000. This increase will help combat inflation and address the higher personal expenses incurred due to changes in work culture, such as working from home, hybrid work, and work from anywhere.n line with the Government's objective of ""Housing for All"" and fostering home ownership, it is suggested that the Government reconsider allowing deductions for interest on self-occupied housing loans under the new default tax regime.To reduce the carbon footprint and move towards clean energy, the Government should reintroduce the deduction provided under section 80EEB (deduction for interest on loan taken to purchase an electric vehicle) and extend it to the new regime as well.Also Read | Budget 2025 income tax: Individual taxpayers want FM Sitharaman to lower tax rates, make new tax regime more attractive, says survey Currently, if a property seller is a resident, buyers must deduct tax at 1% of the consideration if the property value is Rs 50 lakh or more and file a challan-cum-statement, which is a simple and convenient process. However, if the seller is a non-resident, the buyer must obtain a TAN for this one-off transaction, deduct tax at a higher rate, and file a TDS return, which is a cumbersome process. The government should consider introducing challan-cum-statement for non-resident sellers akin to resident sellers to simplify the process.The proposed measures pave the way for significantly improving financial well-being and stimulate economic growth.","It is anticipated that with the thrust of the Government on the adoption of the new tax regime, there may be no changes to the old tax regime.

Sharks divided after the pitch

Anupam Mittal , People Group founder and one of the sharks on Shark Tank India , is once again in the spotlight for his no-holds-barred criticism. This time, his sharp remarks were directed at a social media influencer who pitched a business idea during the show. Vijay Nihalchandani, a business and finance influencer who presented his startup Make My Payment, faced a blunt reality check when Mittal dismissed the idea with the comment, ""Isse acha thela laga lo"" (Better to start a street cart than this).This comes days after Gaurav Taneja, the popular YouTuber and fitness influencer shared his reflections on his experience at the show.“Shut down YouTube and go all in on one business. That’s the advice I got from some Sharks on Shark Tank India,” he revealed in a LinkedIn post. He further revealed that during the pitch, one of the sharks questioned him whether he will continue making videos for YouTube. To which he replied with a confident ‘Yes’.Make My Payment is an app designed to send automated payment reminders to defaulting debtors. Nihalchandani came to the show along with his wife, brother and business partner. The founders pitched their idea on Shark Tank India, seeking Rs 30 lakh in exchange for a 3% equity stake in their company.When asked about the number of users on their platform, Vijay’s wife revealed that out of 3,500 sign-ups, only 200 were paying subscribers. Reacting to this, Anupam Mittal pointed out the weak revenue model and remarked, “You're making Rs 30,000 per month, isse acha thela laga lo”.The influencer-turned-founder’s pitch failed to impress other sharks, namely Namita Thapar and Aman Gupta. Namita Thapar, executive director at Emcure Pharmaceuticals argued that anyone defaulting on payments wouldn’t be persuaded by an automated voice message and could easily block or ignore the calls. While Boat Lifestyle CEO Aman Gupta probed further, asking Vijay if he was involved in anything else apart from this business. Vijay revealed that he is a social media influencer with around 1 million Instagram followers and also runs a profitable hotel bookings business.Lenskart’s Peyush Bansal shifted focus to Vijay's Instagram earnings, to which Vijay responded that he makes approximately Rs 5 lakh per month through the platform. While Peyush appeared impressed by his social media success, the other sharks weren’t as enthusiastic.","Vijay Nihalchandani, a business and finance influencer, presented his startup Make My Payment.

Preview 'Your Attention Please'

For the first time ever, Swiss pharma major Novartis is coming to the Super Bowl with an ad in its “Your Attention, Please” campaign. Hailee Steinfeld and Wanda Sykes star in this 15-second promo for the commercial, which urges everyone to pay attention to the ""important stuff"" in front of them-because nobody ever seems to have a spare minute.The multi-channel campaign will help increase awareness of breast cancer, which is the second most common type of cancer in the United States and the second leading cause of cancer death among American women. It will also raise annual screening rates.Novartis is promoting the importance of regular breast cancer screenings on one of television's biggest stages. The drugmaker is to air its first Super Bowl ad during the repeat matchup between the Philadelphia Eagles and Kansas City Chiefs on February 9, marking the first time the ad has aired in history.Novartis, a breast cancer drug company, launched a ""Your Attention, Please"" campaign on its massive platform to encourage viewers to prioritize their breast health. “We continue to be very active in the therapeutics space, but we also asked ourselves, as a leader in this space, what else can we do?” Victor Bulto, president of Novartis US, said in an interview with Fierce Pharma Marketing.The answer was “pretty clear,” he said: Address the breast cancer diagnosis gap. ""Right now, we know that 1 in 2 women, unfortunately, don’t get their regular mammograms,” he continued. “And we also know that the best chance that they have at surviving is early diagnosis. There’s recent data that point out that early diagnosis can translate into a 99% survival rate—and honestly, that’s what we would like to achieve for every single woman.”The campaign aims to turn attention to women's breasts in society and emphasize the need for better diagnosis and mammograms. Bulto, the creator, said the full commercial is under wraps until its prime-time debut, but it will play on the attention often given to women's breasts.“You will see an ad that defies the current norms of pharma advertisement because, in fact, it is not a pharma advertisement,” he said, emphasizing the ad’s goals of raising awareness about the importance of breast health and, in doing so, increasing early detection of breast cancer.Also Read: “Honored and so proud”: Hailey Steinfeld revealed her participation in the Super Bowl, by collaborating with Novartis for the promotion of breast health Novartis isn’t the only health brand making its advertising debut at the big game.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.
