Professionals Congress launches 'Speak-Up' campaign to promote workplace wellness to help combat stress,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/professionals-congress-launches-speak-up-campaign-to-promote-workplace-wellness-to-help-combat-stress/articleshow/113976054.cms,"NEW DELHI: Urging young professionals struggling with workplace stress to “speak up”, All India Professionals’ Congress (AIPC) on Saturday launched ‘For Anna For All: Workplace Wellness ’ campaign named after Anna Sebastian Perayil, a 26-year-old a CA from Kochi whose alleged death due to extreme work pressure has triggered a nation-wide discussion on workplace stress.The campaign launch follows the assurance given by Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi to the parents of Anna Sebastian during a video call with them on September 21 where he assured them that the Congress will take up the issue affecting professionals nationally and will also raise it in Parliament.Under the ‘Speak-Up’ campaign, AIPC has launched an online platform — ‘ www.profcongress.in/speakup ’ to enable professionals to share their experience with regards to work conditions and incidents and also provide suggestions. According to AIPC complete anonymity will be maintained for professionals who want to remain anonymous.“Millions of professionals across India are facing the same stress and pressure that Anna Sebastian experienced. It’s clear we must do more to support them,” Rahul Gandhi said in a post on X.“This initiative to create healthier working conditions for professionals is a crucial step in the right direction. I encourage everyone to get involved and help drive this movement forward. Together, we can make a meaningful difference,” he added.Sharing the details, AIPC chairman Praveen Chakravarty highlighted that it was a multi-phase programme and an expert group will also be created to draft guidelines for offices across India on ways to improve workplace conditions and wide consultations will be held with professionals and their families.According to AIPC, as a final step Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi will raise this issue in Parliament seeking a constructive discussion on the draft guidelines and urge the government to pass a law.Noting that the problem was widespread, Chakravarty disclosed that 3000 employees of one company have already written to the Professionals’ Congress about their stressful work conditions.He also clarified that the campaign was “completely apolitical”; it was not an Opposition party’s charge against the government. “Nor was it an issue about any particular company or about revenge,” he added.","All India Professionals’ Congress (AIPC) on Saturday launched ‘For Anna For All: Workplace Wellness ’ campaign.

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Saturday ruled out bilateral talks with Pakistan during his upcoming visit to the country for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation ( SCO ).Speaking at the Sardar Patel lecture on Governance, Jaishankar said that while India desires good relations with Pakistan, it cannot be achieved by disregarding the issue of cross-border terrorism and engaging in unrealistic expectations.""Like any neighbour, India would certainly like to have good relations with Pakistan, but that cannot happen by overlooking cross-border terrorism and indulging in wishful thinking. As the Sardar demonstrated, realism must be the foundation for policy. India's relationship with China is similarly an issue on which the Sardar Patel's instincts are on record, and they differ considerably from that of Prime Minister Nehru,"" Jaishankar said.Jaishankar also highlighted the differing views of Sardar Patel and former Prime Minister Nehru regarding India's relationship with China, citing their famous correspondence in 1950.In a press conference following the event, Jaishankar clarified that his upcoming visit to Pakistan for the SCO meeting will be a multilateral event, and he will not be discussing India-Pakistan relations ""I mean, I'm not going there to discuss India-Pakistan relations. I'm going there to be a good member of the SCO. But, you know, since I'm a courteous and civil person, I will behave myself, accordingly,"" he added.Jaishankar is scheduled to visit Pakistan for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) on October 15 and 16.The SCO, established in June 2001, is a Eurasian permanent intergovernmental international organisation consisting of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, India, and China. Known as the ""alliance of the East,"" the SCO is the largest regional organisation in the world, covering three-fifths of the Eurasian continent and nearly half of the human population, representing around 42 per cent of the world's population and 20 percent of the global GDP.","Jaishankar is scheduled to visit Pakistan for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) on October 15 and 16.

Dalrymple criticises British Musuem exhibition 'Silk Roads' for ‘excluding’ India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dalrymple-criticises-british-musuem-exhibition-silk-roads-for-excluding-india/articleshow/113949562.cms,"Ceramic figure of a lute player (Credit: Ashmolean Museum, University of Oxford)

LONDON: Historian William Dalrymple has criticised an exhibition at the British Museum featuring over 300 objects from the Silk Roads from CE 500 to CE 1000 for excluding India.Speaking to TOI from London after visiting the show, Dalrymple said he was shocked India was excluded given that India was the “biggest trading partner where East-West trade took place” during this period.The exhibition “Silk Roads”, which opened last week, claims to “challenge the popular concept of the Silk Road as a single trade route, instead showing how the Silk Roads were made up of overlapping networks.”“Hanging from the ceiling in a single corridor are various location names — it covers almost all of Asia, except India, and it seems so bizarre, because India was the largest trading partner of the Roman empire,” the author said.“When you are trying to present the trade routes of the ancient world and do all the minor sites of international trade and miss out the biggest trading partner where east-west trade took place in its greatest quantity, it is bizarre, particularly when you open the exhibition with a Buddha from Swat and end with a purse containing Rajasthani garnets,” he said.“They acknowledge these garnets, but there is no display for India which should be at the heart of the show. It ends up being a bizarre omission, almost inexplicable, to anyone that knows the centrality of India to ancient trade networks,” he added, pointing out not one Roman coin horde has ever been found in China, yet Roman coin hordes are found in India every year.India was the greatest trading partner with Rome of the classical world, while China and Rome had only the very faintest impression of each other’s existence, Dalrymple said.This is a theme of his book, ""The Golden Road”, in which he argues this notion of an East-West overland route linking China with the Mediterranean, the so-called Silk Road, is a myth which grew out of a Sino-centric reframing of history. “Silk was not even the biggest product imported from the East; pepper from India was,” he said.“India has a haunting presence throughout the exhibition,” Dalrymple said.Buddhism is a central feature, even if the exhibition misses out the home of Buddhism, India.“Nalanda doesn’t feature at all,” he said. “Yet this was the period when the Buddhist monks were coming from Japan and China to Nalanda.”A spokesperson for the British Museum said: “We don’t recognise the characterisation made by Dalrymple. The exhibition goes beyond the narrow 19th-century definition of the Silk Road to present a richer, more complex story of the Silk Roads as overlapping networks.”“Maps in the exhibition and accompanying book also refer to sites from India. For instance, a map showing the probable route of the 9th century ship that sank off the coast of Indonesia, near the island of Belitung, recognises that the vessel most likely stopped at ports along the coast of the Indian subcontinent,” the spokesperson said, adding, “Objects featured throughout the exhibition point to the importance of India in the trade of goods and the transmission of knowledge.”“The game of chess is noted as an invention in India probably around 500 CE and is represented by the world’s oldest group of chess pieces, made from elephant ivory probably sourced from India,” the spokesperson said.",Historian William Dalrymple has criticised an exhibition at the British Museum for excluding India.

"Seek science milestones, not personal glory: Gaganyaan astronaut; next batch selection soon: Isro Chief",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/seek-science-milestones-not-personal-glory-gaganyaan-astronaut-next-batch-selection-soon-isro-chief/articleshow/113946017.cms,"Gaganyaan group Captain Angad Pratap

No personal glory

Comprehensive training

BENGALURU: In an online talk Friday, the first such for any of the four astronaut-designates of the Gaganyaan programme since their selection, Group Captain Angad Pratap said that as India’s human spaceflight programme evolves, the astronaut pool would become more diverse and that aspirants should internalise that there are no personal glories to be sought but only science milestones. Isro chairman S Somanath, in an exclusive interview to TOI on Friday, said that the space agency has already discussed the need for more astronauts with the Indian Air Force (IAF) and that the process would be initiated at a suitable time. IAF’s Institute of Aerospace Medicine (IAM) in Bengaluru screened and selected the first batch of Gaganyaan astronauts and will be involved in creating the larger pool too.Pratap, delivering a talk on ‘who can become an astronaut’ offered insights into the rigorous selection process and training regimen for India’s future space explorers.While giving a disclaimer that he isn’t involved in making policies for future astronaut selection, Pratap emphasised that Isro is particularly interested in candidates from experimental domains and those involved in direct aerospace research.“Any research work that can address the current challenges faced by Isro in its technical pursuits will certainly get preference,” he said. As the programme evolves, Prathap predicts a shift in the selection pool. While early batches may predominantly consist of military aviators and researchers, future selections are likely to diversify.Likening the process to cricket, Pratap described the first batch of astronauts as “openers” or pioneers. “...For the coming decade, they will form the first era of astronauts. These individuals must navigate uncertainties and exhibit patience as the programme develops,” he said.He stressed that becoming an astronaut is a commitment to space research and science, not about fame or simply experiencing a space ride. “The only thing one needs to do is love science. Do science and become science,” he advised aspiring astronauts.“...Remember, your choice to become an astronaut is always for science and it’s not about you…It can never be about celebrity status. But for those who wish to become an astronaut purely to go to space and get a view of the Earth or those who wish to get a kick out of it thinking they are the best, maybe this field is not for them. If someone joins the astronauts corp for such reasons, he or she may not last more than a few years. There’s no personal glory to seek, there are only milestones for the cause of science to seek,” he said.Pratap said the Gaganyaan training programme is comprehensive, covering six key verticals: core academics, physical fitness, aviation skills, psychology, survival skills, and miscellaneous skills. He said astronauts undergo 3-5 hours of daily physical training, including yoga and supervised nutrition.They must also master space theory, participate in simulator sessions, and engage with scientists. Aeromedical training is highlighted as a critical component of the Astronaut Training School (ATS). Survival training in various environments — snow, desert, and sea — is also mandatory.Pratap outlined several core qualities required for aspiring astronauts: honesty and integrity, excellent stress management skills, ability to handle rejection, gratitude for the collective effort behind space missions, sustained focus and discipline, and maturity, humility, and groundedness.On whether any of the four astronaut-designates has been shortlisted to be part of the first Gaganyaan crewed flight, Somanath told TOI: “There will be a process to identify which one of the four will go as part of Gaganyaan, once we have the maturity in terms of the programme. As of now, we are yet to even demonstrate uncrewed missions, we need to do three of them. Once they are done, the health and other parameters of the four astronaut-designates will be reassessed and the committee will choose. All four will be eligible for selection.”","Isro chairman S Somanath said that the space agency has already discussed the need for more astronauts with the Indian Air Force (IAF) Group Captain Angad Pratap said that as India’s human spaceflight programme evolves, the astronaut pool would become more diverse.

The woman is a New Zealand citizen of Indian origin who had got her marriage with an Indian, an NRI, registered in New Zealand in May 2013.They lived together until Nov of the same year and when the husband returned to India, she kept coming to India. She later found out her husband had been married previously. She lodged an FIR against him for breach of trust. The husband was arrested and got bail after a week. However, they continued to meet each other. In her FIR lodged in Sept 2014, the woman said her husband had raped her when at a hotel in Navsari. The man then sought quashing of the FIR. His counsel said the man's second marriage was valid because he was a Muslim, and this would make the rape charge invalid. The govt opposed the quashing petition. ""Since marriage with the applicant of the victim is illegal, when he established physical relations with her during Sep 2014 at Navsari it was a clear case of an offence under IPC Sec 376,"" the prosecutor argued.Justice Umesh Trivedi took note of the fact the woman later married a man of her choice and was not interested in the criminal proceedings. ""They entered into a marriage and got it registered in New Zealand, and thereafter stayed together as husband and wife. Whether entering into that marriage is legal or illegal, physical relations were established with express consent. What is coming out from the FIR is that despite knowing about the suppression of the first marriage of the applicant (husband), she continued the said relations off and on. Not only that, as claimed by her in the FIR itself, she also provided financial help. Without entering into whether it is correct or not, it can safely be presumed that she still wants to continue the said relationship after having knowledge about his first marriage also (sic)."" tnn","Gujarat HC quashes rape charges against a Muslim man after his second wife, who belongs to another faith, filed an FIR against him.

We are sure that institute will flourish under his leadership.""Ramakant Lenka, a member of SIS, said the decision to appoint him was unanimously taken by all SIS members.

The court granted him ad-interim relief by allowing him to continue as VC until Sept 23. This relief was extended thrice for various reasons, such as regular bench not being in session, and paucity of time. On Oct 4, a two-judge bench placed the case for Monday.","SIS officials are now awaiting his formal acceptance. The chancellorship is a five-year term effective from Oct 7.

However, a member claimed it was not discussed during the PAC meeting that took place on Oct 4 and, going by reports, PAC chairman, general secretary of Congress, took the decision ""unilaterally"".Dubey's strongly worded communication is a clear indication that the BJP-led NDA, who are in a majority in the committee, are likely to resist any further move by Venugopal to put the regulator in a spot, signalling that its meetings over the issue will be stormy.

"Ayurveda comes of age, snapping at heels of BDS in Maharashtra admission race",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ayurveda-comes-of-age-snapping-at-heels-of-bds-in-maharashtra-admission-race/articleshow/113972735.cms,"MUMBAI: The field of medical education has undergone a transformation, with students' aspirations and priorities shifting from traditional paths. For youngsters who are successful at NEET, the MBBS degree continues to be the most sought-after choice, with students vying for seats in various colleges and quotas, including the expensive management seats.However, dental course, which was once the clear second option, now has Ayurveda - India's ancient system of medicine - snapping at its heels.The numbers tell the story: In Maharashtra, private Ayurveda colleges closed their recent first-round admissions with a NEET score cut-off of 387, while private dental colleges settled at 396. Dental still holds a slight edge, but the competition is uneven as there are 95 private Ayurveda colleges compared to 25 private dental institutions.A similar trend is seen in govt institutions - admissions to the four dental colleges ended at NEET score of 606, while cut-off at the 22 govt and aided Ayurveda colleges was 436 at the end of first round.In the previous year, the last candidate to get a govt Ayurveda seat had scored 516 in NEET while the corresponding admission in govt dental was 515. In private colleges, the dental cut-off was 201 as compared to 206 of Ayurveda.""This year, top Ayurveda colleges have recorded high cut-offs. Students who missed an MBBS seat by a whisker, have put down their next option as Ayurveda instead of dentistry. Hence, admission in several colleges, including mine, has crossed a score of 450,"" saidMaharashtra University of Health Sciences standing committee chairman Balasaheb Pawar.There is another indicator of growing interest in Ayurveda, which has highest number of colleges and seats after nursing: There is a beeline to start more Ayurveda colleges, said sources from CET cell.Pawar added that after Covid, dental market collapsed and there have been vacant seats in certain govt dental colleges in past three years. ""Before Covid, Ayurveda was languishing... though there were fewer colleges than now, seats remained vacant,"" he said.Pawar pegs Ayurveda's rising popularity to several factors: opening up of govt jobs for Ayurveda graduates, expansion of their scope of work that allows them to practise as general physicians and the increase in the number of patients turning to ""various Indian-pathy"" post-Covid.Ayurveda's rise has been so swift that there are whispers that some colleges now charge capitation fees - though illegal, it's a sign of the field's growing clout.""Ayurveda colleges previously charged 3x the regular fee for institutional quota seats, while MBBS colleges were allowed to charge 5x. This year, Ayurveda colleges demanded 5x rule be extended to them too. Their demand made to medical education ministry, has been forwarded to Fee Regulatory Committee. But colleges are already charging 5x fee,"" said parent representative Sachin Bangad.MUHS vice-chancellor Lt Gen (retd) Dr Madhuri Kanitkar said she is steering Ayurveda into uncharted territory. ""With a sharp focus on rigorous research, enhanced standards in Ayurvedic education, and a commitment to a truly holistic view of health, we are redefining the field. Several Indians practise pluralism - someone at home follows Ayurveda, someone swears by homeopathy, sciences that are wholesome and stress on health being not just curative, but also preventive, promotive, curative, rehabilitative & palliative,"" she said.The creation of a dedicated AYUSH department and the appointment of an Ayurvedic doctor as pro-vice chancellor for the first time are strong signals that the university is focused on Ayurveda.Senior Ayurvedic pediatrician Dr Hetal Nagda has observed a notable shift: Ayurveda has gained momentum post-pandemic, with support from multiple fronts. ""Indian govt has championed it, digitising records and promoting its benefits, but what's striking is people from all walks of life are now embracing it."" Even allopathic doctors, she said, now refer children to Ayurvedic practitioners for ""certain conditions"".","Dental was once the clear second option, now has Ayurveda snapping at its heels.

Jaishankar made it clear Saturday that he had no such intentions, as he again accused Pakistan of sponsoring cross-border terrorism and of preventing SAARC summit process from moving forward.""The visit will be for a multilateral event. I'm not going there to discuss India-Pakistan relations.

Back on old track: Govt gives nod for recruitment of Railway officers through engineering & civil services exams,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/back-on-old-track-govt-gives-nod-for-recruitment-of-railway-officers-through-engineering-civil-services-exams/articleshow/113972540.cms,"NEW DELHI: The govt on Saturday gave the go ahead for recruitment of railway officers through Civil Services Examination (CSE) and Engineering Services Examination (ESE) after struggling to get enough fresh technical manpower through the IRMS, an integrated railway service that cabinet had approved in December 2019.Prior to the Cabinet approval of Indian Railway Management Service (IRMS), the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) used to carry out recruitment tests for railway officers through CSE and ESE.In an office memorandum, the personnel department (DoPT) on Saturday said that considering the railway ministry’s proposal of Thursday, it gave “in-principle approval” for recruitment through UPSC-CSE and UPSC-ESE “considering the unique requirement of both technical and non-technical manpower” in the ministry.Barely hours after the DoPT communication, the railway ministry on Saturday wrote to UPSC and the telecom department said now it has been decided that recruitment of IRMS would be made through CSE and ESE. It said that telecommunication being the nodal ministry for ESE has notified the rules and has sought applications by October 8. It requested the telecom ministry and UPSC to allow participation in the recruitment of 225 engineers by adding to existing notification.It proposed extending the deadline for submission of applications “in order to provide ample opportunity to the candidates for applying”. As per the letter, the new recruits will be called IRMS (Civil), IRMS (Mechanical), IRMS (Electrical), IRMS (S&T) and IRMS (Stores).Railway officials said that in a way this decision is nothing else than bringing back the old system. “The IRMS in railways is not working considering the functional requirement of manpower. Can a student with a history background be tasked to deal with laying of tracks? The govt has understood it. This is a positive move and good for railways,” said a senior official.Interestingly, while giving the “in-principle” approval for the new recruitment mechanism, the DoPT said, “The proposed scheme of recruitment shall not in any way, be in contravention to the decisions of cabinet December 24, 2019 (read merger of services to IRMS).”Railway officials, who had flagged flaws in the IRMS, said though in a way the integrated service will now be redundant, by putting this condition the govt has tried to avoid the embarrassment of how the earlier decision has not yielded the desired results.TOI has learnt that through UPSC-CSE recruitment of officers for accounts, personnel and traffic services would be made while UPSC-ESE would be the exam for recruiting employees for four engineering services -- civil, mechanical, signal, electrical and stores. The Railway Protection Force may be put under the home ministry considering this is a paramilitary force.It can be recalled that so far, no fresh officer recruited under the IRMS regime has joined work as the first batch is still undergoing training and railways isn’t funding enough takers as well.Sources said the Indian Railways had placed an indent for recruiting 150 personnel with the UPSC under the IRMS in 2022. But only 130 candidates were selected. While around 40 of them reported for training at LBSNAA at Mussoorie, the remaining opted for extra-ordinary leave (EOL). Those who reported at LBSNAA are undergoing the final phase of training at a railway institute in Lucknow.Though officials claim that successful candidates taking OEL is normal as they prepare for more exams and without salary, the second round of recruitment in 2023 has not found enough takers. While the railways had placed an indent for another 150 personnel under IRMS, barely 84 have been selected, sources said.The delay in appointment and lukewarm response have caused some shortage of manpower across zones, prompting the railways allowed re-engagement of retired junior railway officers as consultants on an ""exigency basis"" till Dec 2026 to address the staff crunch.In a recent letter, the Railway Board said that re-engagement of retired railway officers as consultants is aimed at addressing the challenges faced by “Zonal Railways due to vacant posts” and to ensure the continuity of operations and services.These consultants will be assigned responsibilities such as inspections, supervision and drawing. “They will be discharged immediately upon the joining of a selected candidate through UPSC or other departmental selection processes,” it said, indicating the delay in getting personnel under the IRMS regime.",Recruitment of railway officers to be done through Civil Services Examination (CSE) and Engineering Services examination (ESE) Personnel department (DoPT) gave “in-principle approval” for recruitment through UPSC-CSE.

He was also sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for life in May 2022 in a terror financing case probed by NIA.Yasin, in his reply-cum-affidavit to the tribunal, claimed that he was assured by “various state officials” in the early Nineties that they shall resolve the Kashmir dispute through a meaningful dialogue and that once he initiated a unilateral ceasefire, all cases against him and JKLF-Y members would be taken back. “Subsequently, a unilateral ceasefire was declared in 1994 by him and his organisation and consequently, he was provided bail in all the 32 pending militancy-related cases under TADA and, thereafter, none of the cases were pursued against him in terms of the ceasefire agreement from 1994 till 2018,” records the tribunal’s order.The JKLF-Y boss claimed that while armed militancy was the outfit’s chosen path from 1988 to 1994 to achieve its aim of establishing a United Independent Kashmir by reintegrating PoK, Gilgit, Baltistan with J&K, “after the year 1994, the said efforts were continued through a non-violent struggle”.The Centre, both in its ban notification dated March 15, 2024, as well as through depositions by officers investigating cases against JKLF-Y, maintained that though Yasin had distanced himself from armed resistance in 1994, he did not step back from supporting and sustaining terrorism. “He used his new facade to become one of the most important channels of financial resources for the violent campaign. JKLF-Y continued its anti-national activities and...played a vital role in the riots which broke out during the years 2008, 2010 and 2016,” it was submitted.Yasin sought to dismiss the charge that he had received Rs 15 lakh from terror-financing accused Zahoor Ahmad Watali as “concocted”, but the tribunal in its order noted that he had refused to comment when asked by ED the purpose of receiving this money. On NIA’s charge that he is implicated in over 89 cases of stone pelting post the killing of Hizbul Mujahideen terrorist Burhan Wani in 2016, Yasin said he was in police custody during the violence.Though Yasin claimed JKLF-Y officers in Kashmir were closed since it was first banned in 2019, he admitted that its international branches in over 50 countries are functional and supporting the cause of the outfit. This belies his submission that there is no unlawful activity by JKLF-Y and its cadres since the 2019 ban.The tribunal, in its order confirming the ban on JKLF-Y, said there is no denial to the assertions by witnesses who deposed on behalf of the Union of India, that JKLF-Y has indulged in acts of secessionism and is still committed to secession of J&K from the Indian Union, “which directly and gravely impinges upon the territorial integrity of India”.","Yasin Malik, who founded JKLF-Y in 1988, is a prime accused in the sensational killing of four Indian Air Force personnel at Rawalpora, Srinagar, in 1990.

The ring was seen as a tribute to his late mother and a way of keeping her legacy close to him and Meghan.However, less than two years after the engagement, the ring underwent a subtle but notable transformation. It was reportedly updated with a slimmer band, a modification that Meghan, 42, first showcased in 2019 during the Trooping the Colour event. The revamped engagement ring was displayed alongside a new ring, and together they became iconic symbols of the Duchess of Sussex .But this year, Meghan has been seen without her engagement ring at multiple public events. In May, she attended a gala without the sentimental piece on her finger, which sparked questions and rumors. Initially, it was reported that the ring was simply ""being fixed,"" yet as time has passed, its absence has only deepened the mystery.A source close to the royal family said that Meghan’s missing ring has raised eyebrows, particularly back in the UK, where Prince William, is known to be deeply protective of his mother’s legacy. The insider expressed confusion over why Meghan would not be “proudly” wearing the ring at significant public events. The source hinted that this development might have caused concern for William, as it touches on the sensitive subject of preserving Princess Diana’s memory. “It's safe to say it has set off alarm bells at the Palace,” a source told The MirrorAccording to Sky news, Diana’s personal jewelry collection which is estimated to be worth around $20 million comprises heirlooms passed down through generations, as well as pieces gifted by foreign royals, her former husband Prince Charles, and her last boyfriend, Dodi Fayed.

Additionally, Adams has been linked to the Kansas City Chiefs following Rashee Rice’s injury, though the Raiders would likely need to absorb part of Adams’ salary to facilitate the move.Also Read: Did the Ravens Eye Davante Adams?

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.",Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

He is now trailing the Tesla CEO by about $50 billion.The Bloomberg Billionaires Index ranks one of the world’ wealthiest individuals daily updates. In 2024, Zuckerberg saw his wealth increase by $78 billion, the largest growth among the 500 richest people tracked by Bloomberg. He owns a 13% stake in Meta, headquartered in Menlo Park, California, which has significantly boosted his position on the wealth index this year.In 2024, Meta's shares surged nearly 70% owing to his rising personal wealth and fueling investors optimistically. This marks a major turn for the company, which laid off 21,000 employees in late 2022 as part of Zuckerberg's cost-cutting strategy—a move seen as pivotal to Meta's recovery.Despite its substantial investments in virtual and augmented reality, investor confidence in Meta remains high. Its core advertising business continues to thrive, and Zuckerberg, at 40 years old, has moved up four places on the wealth index this year. Meta continues to invest heavily in data centres and computing power to lead the AI industry. The company is also advancing with projects like its Orion augmented reality glasses, launched last month. At present, Meta is spending millions of dollars in artificial intelligence, basically augmented reality.Earlier, Mark Zuckerberg shared his vision for Meta’s long-term future with a hope to shape a legacy that would last for 100 long years. Meta continues to be a technology company 20 to 30 years from present. According to him, primarily, he is focussed on the underlying technology platform and focus to continue this for long. He also emphasised that he hopes people will look back and recognize the company for taking bold initiatives that helped push the industry forward.","Mark Zuckerberg becomes the second-richest person surpassing Jeff Bezos.

USCIS updates green card guidelines for those with extraordinary ability,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/uscis-updates-green-card-guidelines-for-those-with-extraordinary-ability/articleshow/113944589.cms,"MUMBAI: The US Citizenship and Immigration Services ( USCIS ) has updated its guidelines for the EB-1 category of visas (aka green cards), available to those who can ‘demonstrate’ extraordinary ability in their field of science, arts, education, business, or sports.Tired of being caught in a decades-long backlog for employment-linked categories of EB-2 (for workers with advanced degrees or specialized knowledge) or EB-3 (for skilled or professional workers) many Indians with a STEM background are exploring the EB-1A option (a sub category of EB-1).For instance, as per NFAP data, as of Nov 2, 2023, only 1.4 lakh Indians were in queue for a EB-1 green card , the numbers for EB-2 and EB-3 cumulative were over a millions.The updated guidance from USCIS focusses on the type of evidence to substantiate extraordinary ability that will be considered by USCIS when reviewing the EB-1 applications. A set number of criteria have to be met to succeed in obtaining this green card.USCIS now recognizes team awards. It also clarifies that past memberships in exclusive or prestigious groups in related fields will be accepted, there is also a relaxation in the conditions relating to publication and clarifications have been issued on exhibitions by the applicant.According to immigration attorneys these updates may broaden the eligibility criteria and aim to provide more transparency and assist petitioners in submitting accurate evidence. However, the exact impact remains to be seen.Awards are one of the ten evidentiary criteria available for EB-1 applicants, who must meet at three. The updated guidance states that team awards will be recognized for EB-1 applicants in categories of ‘lesser’ international and national awards and prizes. Tess Douglas, managing attorney at DGO Legal told TOI, “At the same time the guidance still says that the applicant must be named in the award. So, if a company receives an award for a project that the applicant worked on, it still will not be enough unless the applicant is named as a recipient of the award.” While past memberships in relevant associations will also be accepted. Snehal Batra, managing attorney at NPZ Law Group, points out that if the EB-1 application is not accompanied by any recent evidence, the length of time since membership could be a determining factor on whether the applicant has sustained his/her acclaim. Published material also helps an applicant substantiate his/her extraordinary ability. Here USCIS has removed the condition that the publication must demonstrate the value of the applicant’s work. Lastly, USCIS has clarified applications can include ‘comparable evidence’ for some non-artistic showcases or exhibitions.","The US Citizenship and Immigration Services ( USCIS ) has updated its guidelines for the EB-1 category of visas (aka green cards) This category is available to those who can ‘demonstrate’ extraordinary ability in their field of science, arts, education, business or sports.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113944585,imgsize-27930,width-400,resizemode-4/113944585.jpg"
Marijuana Use: Rising marijuana use in the US leads to growing health concerns,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/rising-marijuana-use-in-the-us-leads-to-growing-health-concerns/articleshow/113977726.cms,"Representative Image (Picture credit: AP)

Across the United States, marijuana use has become more widespread due to increasing legalisation. Healthcare professionals are witnessing a troubling rise in cannabis-related health issues, reported the New York Times.Despite the widespread use of marijuana for both medical and recreational purposes, millions of Americans, particularly chronic users, are suffering from serious health consequences.In midcoast Maine, a paediatrician reports seeing teenagers consuming cannabis throughout the day, while psychiatrists from Washington to West Virginia treat patients experiencing severe delusions, paranoia, and psychosis triggered by the drug.Moreover, emergency rooms are dealing with a surge in cases of cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS), a condition that causes intense vomiting, nausea, and pain, leading to serious complications like dehydration and kidney failure.CHS was first documented in 2004. It is especially concerning, as it can lead to severe health complications, including seizures and even death. Researchers estimate that nearly a third of near-daily cannabis users in the US may exhibit symptoms of this syndrome.THC, the psychoactive compound is what causes the high when using marijuana. When individuals describe a specific type of cannabis as potent, it probably contains a high level of THC.The increase in THC levels over time has likely contributed to the rise in these cases; while cannabis in the 1990s contained about 5 per cent THC, modern products like vape pens and edibles can reach THC levels as high as 99 per cent.Gaps in state regulations, insufficient public health messaging and federal restrictions on research have left consumers and medical professionals unaware of the risks. A common misconception is that cannabis use is not addictive, yet studies show that around 18 million users over the age of 18 report symptoms of cannabis use disorder , according to a Columbia University public health researcher.Doctors are also seeing an increase in cannabis-induced psychosis , which can last from a few hours to several months.Additionally, chronic psychotic disorders, including schizophrenia, are becoming more prevalent, with cannabis often cited as a contributing factor. As marijuana use continues to rise, so do the harmful effects that healthcare systems across the country are grappling with.","Healthcare professionals are witnessing a troubling rise in cannabis-related health issues.

FBI nabs Gandhinagar's 'Al Capone' for defrauding elderly US citizens,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/fbi-nabs-gandhinagars-al-capone-for-defrauding-elderly-us-citizens/articleshow/113975681.cms,"AHMEDABAD: FBI 's hunt for an international scammer posing as Al Capone led them not to Chicago, but to a 24-year-old courier from Gandhinagar , Gujarat living in Georgia. The agents arrested Shreyas Chaudhary , who was using the name of the mobster who ruled Chicago's underworld from 1925 to 1931, for allegedly scamming elderly US citizens out of a staggering $4.8 million.The investigation also resulted in arrest of another surprising figure: 24-year-old Trusha Chaudhary from Gandhinagar, Shreyas's partner-in-crime, who lived with him in Georgia.

"US upgrading its nukes in view of evolving geopolitical environment, says report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-upgrading-its-nukes-in-view-of-evolving-geopolitical-environment-says-report/articleshow/113972385.cms,"MUMBAI: The US has embarked on a massive programme to upgrade and modernise its nuclear weapons due to a deterioration in the geopolitical scenario, states a report of the National Nuclear Security Administration , which is part of the Department of Energy , released Friday.The nearly 200-page report, titled ‘Fiscal Year 2025 — Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan — Biennial Plan Summary’, was presented to the US Congress a few days ago.The report says Russia has increasingly displayed nuclear norm-breaking behaviour, analysis of China’s nuclear programme suggests that it could achieve peer status within a decade, North Korea’s missile testing continues at a significant pace and Iran enriches uranium to a higher level faster than ever before, making negotiations a challenge.“These destabilizing behaviours create an increasingly complex geopolitical environment that is evolving and uncertain. Therefore, nuclear weapons will continue to provide a unique deterrence effect on international security that no other element of US power can achieve for the foreseeable future,” it states.According to the report, some of the nuclear warheads currently undergoing life extension and modernisation include B61-12, W88 Alt 370, B61-13, W80-4, W87-1, W80-4Alt SCLM and W93, all of which are thermonuclear.The nuclear weapon stockpile will be maintained without underground explosive testing, and 80 plutonium pits will be produced annually, it says. A pit is the core of an implosion nuclear weapon.The report further says that future warhead options are being explored to meet required military characteristics based on the threats and possibilities posed by potential adversaries.“With several major warhead modernization activities underway, the Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration is working to reduce warhead age while meeting emerging challenges on a timeline that does not put the nuclear deterrent at risk,” it states.In its conclusion, the report reiterates that the global threat environment is rapidly evolving and becoming increasingly dangerous, complex and uncertain. “In response to this changing environment, the United States must develop a modern, resilient and flexible nuclear security enterprise to provide the DOD (Department of Defence) with the necessary capabilities to continue to execute its critical nuclear deterrent mission.”",The US has embarked on a massive programme to upgrade and modernise its nuclear weapons due to a deterioration in the geopolitical scenario.
