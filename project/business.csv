NEW DELHI: The India Meteorological Department has issued a red alert for the next 24 hours, warning of dense to very dense fog across large parts of north India, even as air quality in the national capital and surrounding regions remained in the ‘very poor’ to ‘severe’ category on Friday.According to the IMD, very dense fog is likely to prevail over Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, with Uttar Pradesh also expected to witness a very cold day. Dense to extremely dense fog has been forecast across Punjab, Uttarakhand and Bihar on December 19 and 20, and over Uttar Pradesh and Haryana during the early morning hours. The weather agency said fog conditions are likely to persist for the next two to three days, raising concerns over reduced visibility, travel delays and road safety.Airport authorities said flight operations were impacted through the day, with 79 departures cancelled, including two international flights, and 73 arrivals cancelled, including two international services. Passengers have been advised to check with their respective airlines for the latest updates before heading to the airport.In Delhi, hazardous air conditions continued, with thick smog blanketing several areas, including Anand Vihar.The Commission for Air Quality Management activated all measures under GRAP Stage IV across Delhi-NCR to curb rising pollution levels.Data from the Central Pollution Control Board showed the Air Quality Index at 442 in Ghazipur, 409 in ITO and 447 in Palam, placing these areas in the ‘severe’ category. The city’s overall AQI stood at 330 at 7.47 am, while earlier readings showed levels as high as 358 during the morning hours. At around 8 am, Delhi’s overall AQI was recorded at 387, placing it in the ‘very poor’ category.Authorities advised residents, particularly children, the elderly and people with respiratory ailments, to limit outdoor exposure as pollution continued to pose serious health risks.Dense fog also disrupted aviation operations at the Indira Gandhi International Airport, with flights being operated under CAT III conditions, leading to multiple delays. Delhi International Airport said low visibility was affecting flight schedules.“Dense fog is impacting flight schedules, and operations are currently under CAT III conditions. Our on-ground teams are working in close coordination with all stakeholders to assist passengers and provide necessary support across all terminals. For real-time flight updates, please reach out to your respective airlines. We sincerely regret any inconvenience caused and appreciate your understanding,” the airport said in a statement.CAT III is a category of the Instrument Landing System that allows aircraft to land in extremely low visibility conditions and requires advanced equipment and specialised pilot training.IndiGo also issued a travel advisory, saying early-morning fog in Delhi and across parts of northern India was disrupting flight operations. “Early-morning fog in Delhi and across parts of northern India is reducing visibility and disrupting flight operations. We seek your understanding, as this is a seasonal occurrence, and flight movements are being managed accordingly to ensure safe and orderly operations. Customers travelling in the early hours may experience delays or revised timings. We recommend checking the latest flight status prior to leaving for the airport, goindigo.in/flight-status,” the airline said in a post on X.“Our teams are actively monitoring weather conditions and coordinating with air traffic authorities. Wherever possible, we are making operational adjustments to minimise inconvenience and ensure customer support remains available across all key touchpoints. We will keep you informed and get you on your way as soon as conditions permit,” the post added.On Thursday, 15 out of 40 air quality monitoring stations in Delhi recorded ‘severe’ pollution levels. Anand Vihar reported the highest AQI at 441, falling under the ‘severe-plus’ category, while 24 stations logged ‘very poor’ air quality, according to CPCB’s SAMEER app.As per official classification, AQI levels between 401 and 500 are considered ‘severe’, while readings above 300 indicate ‘very poor’ air quality.Data from the Decision Support System for Air Quality Management showed transport as the largest contributor to Delhi’s pollution at 18.3 per cent, followed by industries at 9.2 per cent. Residential sources contributed 4.5 per cent, construction activities 2.5 per cent, waste burning 1.6 per cent, road dust 1.3 per cent, other sectors 1.2 per cent and power generation around 1.2 per cent.Pollution from neighbouring NCR districts also added to Delhi’s air quality woes, with Jhajjar contributing 12.3 per cent, Sonipat 8.8 per cent, Rohtak 4.8 per cent, Jind 3.1 per cent, Bhiwani 1.4 per cent and Gurugram 1.1 per cent.Meanwhile, the IMD urged people to exercise caution, avoid unnecessary travel during foggy conditions and stay updated with local advisories over the next few days.","The India Meteorological Department has issued a red alert for the next 24 hours, warning of dense to very dense fog across large parts of north India.

VB - G RAM G row: Opposition sleeps outside Parliament in protest - watch video,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/vb-g-ram-g-bill-opposition-stages-overnight-protest-in-parliament-over-mgnrega-replacement-video/articleshow/126067758.cms,"Lok Sabha Passes Viksit Bharat G Ram G Bill Amid Protests, Opposition Tears Copies Over Gandhi Name

NEW DELHI: Opposition parties staged a 12-hour overnight dharna in the Parliament complex on Thursday night to protest the passage of the Viksit Bharat Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) Bill, or VB-G RAM G Bill, which replaces the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act.The protest came hours after Parliament cleared the Bill amid noisy scenes and walkouts. The Rajya Sabha passed the legislation post midnight by a voice vote, following its approval by the Lok Sabha earlier in the day, even as opposition members demanded its withdrawal and sought its referral to a parliamentary panel.Opposition MPs accused the government of rushing the Bill through without adequate debate and of scrapping a flagship rural employment scheme that, they said, supported crores of poor households. Several members walked out of the Upper House, raised slogans against the government and tore copies of the Bill, prompting repeated warnings from the Chair.Trinamool Congress Rajya Sabha deputy leader Sagarika Ghose alleged that the government had “bulldozed” the legislation. “This is an insult to India's poor, it is an insult to Mahatma Gandhi, it is an insult to Rabindranath Tagore. With just five hours' notice, this bill was given to us.We were not allowed a proper debate,” she said.“Our demand was such an important bill should be sent to the Select Committee and let the opposition parties examine it, let the opposition parties discuss it, let all stakeholders discuss it, but no, in a display of tyranny, in a murder of democracy,” Ghose said, announcing the overnight protest. “We are now going to sit on a 12-hour dharna, 12-hour dharna against the manner in which the Modi government has brought this black law against the people of India, against the poor of India, against the rural poor of India. ”Congress general secretary Randeep Singh Surjewala described the development as a “sad day for the country's labour force” and alleged that the government had hit the livelihoods of millions. “This is perhaps the saddest day for the labourers of India. BJP government has attacked the livelihood of 12 crore people by repealing the MGNREGA . They have proved that the Modi government is anti-farmer and anti-poor,” he said.Congress leader Mukul Wasnik said the original law was framed after extensive consultations. “When MGNREGA was drafted, consultations were held for 14 months. It was passed by Parliament with consensus. The scheme would put an extreme burden on states. As a result, this scheme will collapse,” he said.DMK leader Tiruchi Siva accused the government of erasing Mahatma Gandhi’s legacy. “Likewise they have removed Mahatma Gandhi's name himself. Without Gandhi there is no freedom, that is the total belief in this country. Even in Britain parliament we are having Gandhi statue, but here in Indian parliament his statue is hidden somewhere, and now the scheme which bore his name, his name has also been removed,” he said.Defending the legislation, Rural Development Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said the new law was necessary to address shortcomings in the old scheme and to boost rural development. “This Bill is very necessary as it will help provide employment opportunities, help development of rural India and take the country forward,” he said while replying to the debate in the Rajya Sabha.Chouhan accused the Congress of misusing Mahatma Gandhi’s name for political gains and of disrupting parliamentary proceedings. “I heard the opposition with patience all these hours and expected the opposition to hear my response to the discussion. Making their points, making allegations and running away is like murdering the dreams and ideals of Mahatma Gandhi,” he said.“The entire nation is watching their 'goondagardi' and the opposition is committing the sin of insulting democracy. House 'dadagiri se nahin chalega',” the minister added.He also cited funding figures to defend the government’s record, claiming that while the previous UPA government released Rs 2.13 lakh crore for MGNREGA, the NDA had released nearly Rs 8.53 lakh crore. The opposition, however, maintained that the passage of the Bill without detailed scrutiny set a dangerous precedent and said it would take its protest against the law to the streets across the country.",Opposition parties staged a 12-hour overnight dharna to protest the passage of the Viksit Bharat Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) Bill.

Can Andhra’s rare earth corridor fuel India’s clean-energy dreams?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/can-andhras-rare-earth-corridor-fuel-indias-clean-energy-dreams/articleshow/126067460.cms,"The mineral-rich belt forms an unbroken stretch along Andhra’s coastline (Picture credit: A Sarath Kumar)

Along Andhra Pradesh’s sweeping 974km coastline, the waves wash more than picturesque beaches and bustling fishing harbours. Beneath the dark, heavy sands — from Srikakulam in the north to Nellore in the south — lies one of India’s most valuable and underexploited geological assets: rare earth mineral reserves that could define the nation’s cleanenergy, defence and semiconductor future.These beach sands contain vast quantities of monazite, the primary source of rare earth elements (REEs) and thorium, along with ilmenite, rutile, zircon, garnet and sillimanite, making the state a rich natural repository of strategic minerals.What distinguishes Andhra’s reserves is not only their abundance, but also their grade. Monazite extracted along this coast carries 55-60% rare earth oxides — among the highest in global benchmarks — and 8-10% thorium, considered a potential fuel for India’s next-generation nuclear reactors.The ore houses a complete suite of light REEs such as lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, neodymium, samarium, europium and gadolinium, elements that power permanent magnets essential for electric vehicles, wind turbines, missile guidance, satellite systems, fibreoptics, superconductors and advanced medical diagnostics.The mineral-rich belt stretches like a continuous corridor. Geological surveys identify promising deposits at Bhimunipatnam, Kalingapatnam, Kakinada, Narsapur, Machilipatnam, Chirala, Vodarevu, Ramayapatnam and Dugarajapatnam, forming an uninterrupted chain of strategic material potential.Estimates by the Atomic Minerals Directorate and Indian Rare Earths Limited (IREL) place India’s total deposits at over 300 million tonnes of heavy mineral sands (sand deposits rich in dense, valuable minerals like ilmenite, rutile and zircon), with 12-15 million tonnes of monazite, enough to support 40-50% of domestic rare earth requirements for decades.Andhra is estimated to hold 3035% of India’s monazite reserves.For long, these beaches have remained underutilised, overshadowed by concerns around atomic regulation, limited processing capacity and policy restrictions. Now, with global supply chains tightening and countries scrambling to diversify away from China — which controls nearly 85% of global REE processing capacity — the state has quietly moved into strategic focus.Recognising the opportunity, the Andhra Pradesh Mineral Development Corporation (APMDC) has stepped up exploration and monetisation efforts with renewed urgency. The Centre has granted 16,000 hectares of beach sand-mining leases to the corporation, marking one of the largest allocations for any state. Of this, operational clearance has been issued for 1,000 hectares, recently allotted to a private developer through open tender. Encouraged by potential revenue prospects, the state has sought approval to open another 4,000 hectares, after which the corporation plans to scale out activities across the remaining 11,000 hectares on a fast-track basis.APMDC’s shift is not confined to mining. The focus now is on value addition within India — crucial because exporting raw ore leads to importing high-value end products at a steep cost. “We are concentrating on downstream processing facilities to make the country self-reliant,” APMDC managing director and senior IAS officer Pravin Kumar told TOI, underlining the state’s aggressive roadmap. “Exporting raw minerals forces us to import finished rare earth magnets, chips and components at a high premium. The Centre’s PLI (production-linked incentive) will be a game changer.”At present, monazite processing remains the exclusive domain of IREL, a Central PSU operating under atomic mineral regulations. Private players can mine associated minerals such as garnet, ilmenite and zircon but must hand over monazite to IREL after separation. To increase domestic refining capacity, IREL is establishing a 10,000-tonne-perannum monazite processing plant at Gudur, Nellore, scheduled for commissioning in 2026. Once operational, it is expected to become a central pillar of India’s REE value chain.In a major policy intervention aimed at cutting import dependence and accelerating green-tech manufacturing, the ministry of mines has rolled out guidelines for pilot projects to recover critical minerals — including REEs — from mining waste, red mud, fly ash and industrial tailings. The programme, approved under the National Critical Mineral Mission (NCMM), earmarks funding of up to Rs 100 crore from the National Mineral Exploration and Development Trust (NMEDT) for recovery-oriented R&D and commercial pilots.The mission targets securing domestic supply of 24 strategic minerals such as neodymium, dysprosium, yttrium and cobalt, vital for EV batteries, solar wafers, turbines and missiles. “These guidelines mark a pivotal step towards converting waste into wealth,” said Geetika Sharma, director (projects), NMEDT. Pilot studies may receive 90% central funding, enabling partnerships across PSUs, academia, startups and private mining companies.This policy push is particularly advantageous for Andhra Pradesh. Though placer deposits have for decades supported India’s titanium and zircon industries, enormous quantities of tailings with recoverable REEs, thorium and uranium have remained unprocessed due to lack of technology and regulatory clarity.Andhra Pradesh already possesses early-stage infrastructure that could scale with the new policy. A private REE-processing plant in Anantapur is operational and handles thousands of tonnes annually. IREL runs a beach sand separation plant in Visakhapatnam, generating tailings suited for rare earth extraction using hydrometallurgical and solvent-extraction techniques. Officials estimate that reprocessing alone could unlock a Rs 5,000-crore annual opportunity through circular extraction.“Our monazite reserves can yield dysprosium for EV magnets and terbium for high-performance turbines,” a senior mines and geology department official toldTo ensure accountability, proposals will be screened by an inter-ministerial project sanctioning committee, while technical validation will come from experts at IITBombay, IIT-ISM Dhanbad and CSIR-IMMT Bhubaneswar. Implementation pathways will be led by Jawaharlal Nehru Aluminium Research Development and Design Centre, Nagpur for mining waste recovery projects and Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF), under the Centre’s department of science and technology, for tech-driven pilots.The Andhra government is preparing applications to recover REEs from thermal plant fly ash in Nellore and Krishnapatnam, known to contain trace rare earths. Collaboration possibilities with IIT-Hyderabad, National Mineral Processing Laboratory (Jamshedpur) and geologists are being explored, especially around bio-leaching and electrochemical extraction.Scientists say tailings (ore residues) at Andhra Pradesh and comparable IREL operations in Kerala suggest that over 80% REE extraction is achievable with modern technology.DAR Subramanyam, a retired economics professor from Acharya Nagarjuna University, noted that rapid scale-ups can reduce India’s import dependence from 95% to nearly 50% within five years, provided commercial plants are deployed under the National Critical Mineral Mission (NCMM) framework.With global REE demand expected to grow tenfold by 2030, Andhra stands positioned to emerge as the country’s critical-mineral capital.The first call for proposals under the PLI window is expected shortly, signalling what experts describe as the beginning of a mineral renaissance on the state’s shoreline.From being a silent geological marvel, Andhra’s beaches are on the cusp of powering India’s transition to clean mobility, renewable energy and advanced electronics. The sands are no longer just a coastal landscape — they are India’s next strategic frontier.","Andhra Pradesh is estimated to hold 3035% of India’s monazite reserves.

Delhi Air Pollution Protest At India Gate Turns Violent Amid ‘Madvi Hidma Amar Rahe’ Slogans

NEW DELHI: A dense blanket of fog enveloped Delhi-NCR on Monday morning, severely reducing visibility across roads and disrupting normal movement, while the region continued to grapple with toxic air quality in the ‘severe-plus’ category. The deteriorating weather and pollution conditions also impacted air travel, prompting IndiGo Airlines to issue a travel advisory warning passengers of possible delays and urging them to plan their journeys with extra caution.Amid changing weather conditions, IndiGo Airlines on Monday issued a travel advisory for passengers as Delhi witnessed the first signs of winter fog this season, impacting visibility at the airport.In its advisory, the airline said visibility levels around the airport were currently reduced, and as a result, flight operations were being adjusted, with some departures likely to take longer than usual. IndiGo assured passengers that its teams remain available to provide support, acknowledging that travel plans, schedules, and connections are important.The airline also cautioned that road traffic could be slower due to foggy conditions and advised passengers to plan their journeys accordingly and allow additional time to reach the airport.IndiGo said it is closely monitoring the situation and will keep passengers informed, adding that departures will continue as conditions improve, with safety remaining the top priority.Similarly Air India issued a travel advisory for passengers; it said, ""Poor visibility due to dense fog is impacting flight operations in Delhi and parts of Northern India. Please check your flight status at: http://airindia.com/in/en/manage/flight-status.html before heading to the airport.""Earlier on Sunday, Delhiites could literally see poison in the air. A thick layer of toxic smog enveloped the capital, turning the city into a gas chamber with air quality plunging to 'severe-plus' category for the first time this year.The city's 24-hour average air quality index stood at 461, the second-worst recorded in Dec and the worst in nearly 13 months. Since the scale began in April 2015, only once has a higher AQI been recorded in Dec - 469 on Dec 21, 2017. For any month, the last time Delhiites a suffered worst AQI was on Nov 18 last year (494).High moisture, low temperatures and calm winds effectively trapped pollution close to the surface even as a grey smog screened out the sun for most of the day. Winds are predicted to pick up slightly post-noon on Monday, which could disperse some pollutants.On Sunday, atmospheric ‘inversion’ made the situation worse. This occurs when cooler air near the ground gets trapped under warmer air above, stopping pollutants from dispersing. Though meteorological conditions remained unfavourable for the dispersion of pollutants, local emissions continued to remain high.“This is a true depiction of Delhi’s local emissions because wind speeds are almost zero, meaning there is hardly any inflow or outflow of air. Vertical ventilation is confined to a column of just 600 metres, which means whatever remains in the box — Delhi — is largely its own emissions. Under these conditions, the contribution of dust is negligible. When dust is released from construction activity, it usually spreads to other areas due to wind, but with winds nearly calm, it cannot pollute places beyond the immediate site of release,” said Gufran Beig, founder of the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) and Chair Professor at the National Institute of Advanced Studies (NIAS).Of the total 39 active air quality monitoring stations, 38 saw ‘severe’ AQI while only Shadipur was placed in the ‘very poor’ category at 375. Of these, three stations — Wazirpur, Rohini and Ashok Vihar — maxed out at 500, while several others reported AQI above 490.This is the second spell of severe air days in Delhi this season. The city had recorded three consecutive severe days from Nov 11 to 13. In this winter season, the city has recorded five such days, when AQI surpassed 400.After air quality started rapidly deteriorating on Saturday, the Graded Response Action Plan’s stage III was imposed in the morning. Stage IV was invoked on Saturday evening as AQI showed no sign of improvement. Currently, all stages of GRAP are in force.Delhi’s highest-ever AQI of 497 was recorded on Nov 6, 2016. The second-worst air quality day followed on Nov 18 last year with AQI reaching 494.Experts said since winds are likely to rise only marginally post-noon, no significant respite from toxic air quality is expected on Monday. However, the Centre’s Air Quality Early Warning System (EWS) stated that the AQI may dip to ‘very poor’ on Monday. “Delhi’s air quality is likely to be in the ‘very poor’ category from Dec 15 till 17. The outlook for the subsequent six days from Dec 18 is that AQI is likely to be in the ‘very poor’ category,” said the EWS.The CPCB classifies AQI 050 as 'good', 51-100 as 'satisfactory', 101-200 as 'moderate', 201300 as 'poor', 301-400 as 'very poor', 401-450 as 'severe', and 451 and above as ‘severe plus.’ Meanwhile, the lowest visibility on Sunday morning was recorded at 200 metres at Safdarjung. It was 350 metres at Palam. “Safdarjung reported 300 metres at 5.30am but calm winds further reduced the visibility to 200 metres at 8am,” said a Met official.India Meteorological Department measures fog in terms of visibility. Visibility between 500-1,000 metres is considered ‘shallow’ fog. Fog is 'moderate' when visibility is between 200-500 metres, and ‘dense’ below 200 metres.The maximum temperature was recorded at 24 degrees Celsius, one degree above normal. The minimum stood at 8.2 degrees C. IMD has predicted shallow to moderate fog in the early hours of Monday.","A dense blanket of fog enveloped Delhi-NCR on Monday morning, severely reducing visibility across roads and disrupting normal movement.

NEW DELHI: Close to one million Indians have renounced their citizenship over the last five years, with annual numbers crossing the two-lakh mark consistently since 2022, according to data presented by the government in Parliament.The trend has reignited a crucial question why a growing number of Indians - particularly the wealthy and highly skilled - are choosing to give up their Indian passports.Responding to questions raised by Congress MP KC Venugopal in the Lok Sabha, the ministry of external affairs (MEA) said that 2.06 lakh Indians gave up citizenship in 2024, following 2.16 lakh in 2023 and 2.25 lakh in 2022. Earlier, 1.63 lakh renunciations were recorded in 2021, while the figure stood at 85,256 in 2020, the lowest in a decade due to Covid-related disruptions.Between 2011 and 2024, a total of over 20.6 lakh Indians renounced citizenship, with nearly half of them doing so in just the last five years, the government presented data during the ongoing winter session showed.Venugopal sought details on whether the government had studied the reasons behind the rising trend and what steps were being taken to curb citizenship renunciation, particularly among younger Indians.The issue has also been raised by other opposition leaders in recent years, who have flagged what they describe as a growing “exit of the successful” from India.Leading opposition members including TMC MP Mahua Moitra have previously as well questioned the government as to why people are renouncing Indian passports. During a debate on the economy she had asked whether this indicated a ""healthy economic environment"" or a ""healthy tax environment"". Moitra alleged that an ""atmosphere of terror"" created by the enforcement directorate (ED), with investigations primarily targeting opposition leaders and businessmen, was a contributing factor.Sanjaya Baru, media adviser to former PM Manmohan Singh, in his book ‘Secession of the Successful’, argued that India is witnessing a fourth wave of emigration, marked by the departure of high net worth individuals (HNIs), their families, and elite professionals. Citing Morgan Stanley data, Baru noted that around 23,000 Indian millionaires left the country between 2014 and 2023.Opposition leaders have repeatedly questioned whether rising wealth migration reflects concerns over quality of life, governance, education, taxation and long-term security, especially when compared to developed economies.In its written reply, minister of state for external affairs Kirti Vardhan Singh said the reasons for renunciation are personal and known only to the individuals concerned.“The Government recognises the potential of the global workplace in an era of knowledge economy,” the MEA said, adding that a successful and influential Indian diaspora is an asset. It added that the government’s focus was on engaging the diaspora and leveraging its expertise and soft power, rather than discouraging overseas citizenship.The MEA also placed on record a list of 135 countries whose citizenship Indians have acquired, underlining the global spread of the trend.One of the most cited reasons for Indians giving up citizenship is India’s lack of dual citizenship. Under Section 9 of the Citizenship Act, 1955, any Indian who voluntarily acquires foreign citizenship automatically loses Indian citizenship.For Indians abroad, citizenship often decides access to voting rights, social security, permanent residence, public-sector employment and legal protections. While Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) status allows visa-free travel and limited economic rights, it does not give much of political rights.As a result, many long-term migrants - especially those with families - are left with little choice but to formally renounce Indian citizenship.While the sharp jump in 2022 was partly attributed to pandemic-era backlogs, the continuation of high numbers in 2023 and 2024 suggests a new baseline, analysts say.Before the pandemic, annual renunciations largely remained within a range of 1.2 lakh to 1.45 lakh for nearly a decade.Though occupation-wise data is not available, global studies show that Indians form one of the world’s largest skilled migrant populations. According to the UN, India has remained the largest source country of international migrants, with a diaspora of 17.5 million as of 2019.In the US alone, 81 per cent of Indian immigrants aged 25 and above hold at least a bachelor’s degree, significantly higher than both native-born and other immigrant groups, according to the Migration Policy Institute.Migrants often cite better pay, cleaner environments, reliable infrastructure, stronger civic services, education systems and clearer pathways to residency and citizenship abroad. For many, citizenship becomes the final step in a long migration journey that begins with education and employment.India remains the world’s top recipient of remittances, receiving an estimated $125 billion in 2023, according to the World Bank. However, opposition leaders argue that the steady outflow of citizens/ brain drain - especially among the affluent and skilled - calls for the need for reforms in urban living conditions, public health, education, social security and income parity.As renunciation numbers moves upwards of two lakh annually, the issue is likely to remain a political and policy flashpoint, particularly amid concerns over talent retention and long-term economic competitiveness.","2.06 lakh Indians gave up citizenship in 2024, following 2.16 lakh in 2023 and 2.25 lakh in 2022. Between 2011 and 2024, a total of over 20.6 lakh Indians renounced citizenship.

A shrinking global water reserve



Groundwater: India’s invisible lifeline

The most vulnerable regions are concentrated in three broad zones:

Northwest India: Punjab, Haryana, Delhi and western Uttar Pradesh — where groundwater recharge exists but indiscriminate withdrawal, driven largely by agriculture, has led to over-extraction.

Rajasthan and parts of Gujarat — where arid conditions limit natural recharge. Southern peninsular India: including Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, where hard, crystalline aquifers have low storage capacity.

NITI Aayog has warned that 21 major Indian cities, including Delhi, Bengaluru and Chennai, face the risk of depleting their groundwater reserves.

Bengaluru water crisis

Why is India running out of water?



Rising demand: India’s water demand is expected to outstrip supply by 2030

Agricultural overuse: Water-intensive crops like paddy in Punjab and Haryana

Encroachment of water bodies: Lakes and ponds disappearing, especially in cities like Bengaluru

Climate change: Erratic monsoons and declining river flows

Pollution: Industrial waste, sewage, and mining contaminating groundwater

Weak regulation: Outdated laws like the Easement Act of 1882, which ties groundwater ownership to land

Fragmented governance: Separate authorities for surface and groundwater management

Public apathy: Water treated as a free, unlimited resource

Groundwater overuse and contamination



Nearly 70% of groundwater sources are contaminated

India ranks 120th out of 122 countries on the global water quality index

State and UT-wise classification shows:

Over-exploited (>100%): Haryana, Punjab and Rajasthan

Critical (90–100%): Delhi

High stress (70–90%): Tamil Nadu and Puducherry

Moderate to low stress (<70%): All remaining states and UTs, including Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Telangana, West Bengal, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, and several northeastern states.

The invisible crisis beneath our feet



Behind this lies a darker reality, an informal and often illegal groundwater trade.

In a narrow lane of India, men and women wait quietly with plastic drums lined in rows. Some squat, some sit, with eyes fixed on the bend ahead.Suddenly, the silence breaks. A water tanker reverses into the alley, its engine drowning out the waiting. Young men rush forward, climbing atop the truck, lowering pipes into the tank. Within moments, quiet order unravels into chaos.Hundreds of kilometres away, in rural India, women walk long distances to empty wells, dried-up tubewells and shrinking water bodies, hoping to find a few litres of water.Just because some cities suffered floods doesn’t mean you have water. For a country that supports nearly 17% of the world’s population with just 4% of its freshwater resources, water scarcity has become a daily reality, and not just a distant threat.With India’s population expected to rise from 1.3 billion to nearly 1.7 billion by 2050, the question is no longer whether India is facing a water crisis.But how soon parts of the country will run out!A water crisis occurs when the availability of safe, usable water falls short of demand. The World Bank defines water scarcity as a situation where annual per capita water availability drops below 1,000 cubic metres.India is steadily moving towards this threshold.Despite supporting 17% of the world’s population, India has access to only 4% of global freshwater resources. According to NITI Aayog's Composite Water Management Index (CWMI), the country is facing the worst water crisis in its history, with nearly 600 million people experiencing high to extreme water stress.India’s per capita water availability stood at 1,486 cubic metres in 2021, placing it in the water-stressed category (below 1,700 cubic metres). Government estimates suggest this could fall further to 1,341 cubic metres by 2025 and 1,140 cubic metres by 2050, pushing large parts of the country closer to scarcity.Globally, freshwater reserves have declined sharply over the last two decades, with losses estimated at 324 billion cubic metres every year, enough to meet the annual water needs of 280 million people.According to the Union minister of Jal Shakti releases Dynamic Ground Water Resource Assessment Report of the Country for the Year 2025, “Groundwater assessment units across India are categorised as safe, semi critical, critical and over exploited, based on the ratio of annual groundwater extraction and replenishment in the phreatic aquifer. The assigned categories aid in planning, management, and regulation of the country's groundwater resources. ”Water consumption worldwide increased by 25% between 2000 and 2019, with nearly a third of that growth occurring in already water-stressed regions, the report stated.Northern India figures prominently among these drying zones, alongside parts of northern China, Central America and the southwestern United States. Rising temperatures, erratic rainfall, worsening droughts and unsustainable land and water use have accelerated the decline.For India, the implications are stark. Agriculture, livelihoods, urban growth and ecological sustainability all hinge on groundwater, the country’s most heavily used and least regulated water source.Groundwater forms the backbone of India’s water security. According to the 2019 NITI Aayog report, the Central Groundwater Board (CGWB) stated that the contribution of groundwater is nearly 62% in irrigation, 85% in rural water supply and 45% in urban water supply.Yet this invisible lifeline is being drawn down faster than it can be replenished. As per the Dynamic Ground Water Resource Assessment 2025, India’s total annual groundwater recharge stands at 448.52 billion cubic metres (bcm).After accounting for natural discharge, the annual extractable resource is estimated at 407.75 bcm. Current extraction has reached 247.22 bcm, pushing the national stage of groundwater extraction to about 60.6%.While the national average may suggest moderate stress, the reality on the ground is far more uneven.Out of the total 6,762 assessment units, around 25% have been categorised as Overexploited, Critical, or Semi-Critical. These are areas where extraction is approaching or exceeding natural recharge, a warning sign that aquifers are under severe stress.States with the highest proportion of over-exploited and critical units include Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu and Delhi. In Punjab, groundwater extraction stands at over 156% of annual recharge. Rajasthan follows closely at 147%, while Delhi’s extraction level exceeds 90%, placing it in the critical category.Urban centres are not immune.Chennai already experienced ‘day zero’ in June 2019, when all four major reservoirs of the big city reservoirs ran dry. People had to line up for hours to wait for a small allocation of water brought in by trucks from other areas.A BBC report, citing UN projections, ranked Bengaluru second after Brazil’s São Paulo, among 11 global cities at risk of running out of drinking water. As water levels drop and summer temperatures rise, cities are imposing restrictions.Lakhs of residents across the 'city of dreams,' Mumbai are too grappling with acute water scarcity. In Bengaluru, authorities have banned the use of potable water for non-essential activities such as washing cars and watering gardens. Yet questions remain over whether fines and regulations alone can avert a full-blown crisis.In rural areas, the crisis manifests differently, in longer walks for water, abandoned wells and failed crops.Experts point to multiple, interconnected causes:India is the largest user of groundwater in the world, accounting for over 25% of global groundwater extraction. The consequences are severe:Groundwater extraction in India is assessed using data from the Minor Irrigation Census and sample surveys conducted by State Ground Water Departments. According to the National Compilation on Dynamic Ground Water Resources of India, 2025, the country’s total annual groundwater extraction is estimated at 247.22 billion cubic metres (bcm).The agriculture sector remains the largest consumer, accounting for 87% of total extraction, or 215.10 bcm. Domestic use contributes 11% (27.89 bcm), while industrial use accounts for the remaining 2% (4.23 bcm).Water-intensive cropping patterns, such as paddy cultivation in Punjab and Haryana, and it continues to strain aquifers, even in regions where rainfall is relatively adequate. As India’s population grows and incomes rise, food demand is expected to surge.According to the NITI report, India’s population is expected to increase to 1.66 billion by 2050. At the same time, per capita income is estimated to increase by 5.5% per annum. With increasing population and purchasing power, the annual food requirement in the country will exceed 250 million tons by 2050. The total demand for grains will increase to 375 million tons including grain for feeding livestock by 2050.”“This will increase the demand for food. The surge in demand for these water-intensive crops will, ceteris paribus, multiply our current agricultural consumption of water,” it added.Despite a national average that masks local crises, groundwater stress is highly concentrated. More than 25% of administrative units fall under over-exploited, critical or semi-critical categories in nine states and UTs: Haryana, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi and Puducherry.These regions face the highest risk of aquifer depletion, underscoring the urgent need for targeted groundwater management, crop diversification and demand-side interventions.Rainfall remains the primary source of groundwater recharge in India, but its distribution varies widely across regions and seasons. Most of the country receives rainfall during the southwest monsoon, while long dry spells dominate the rest of the year.Groundwater levels typically fall before the monsoon and recover partially during and after it. However, CGWB data shows that in 2024, more than 57% of monitored wells recorded a fall in water levels compared to the previous year, with significant declines observed in states such as Punjab, Rajasthan, Delhi, Maharashtra, Telangana and Uttar Pradesh.Geology further complicates the picture.According to the National Compilation on Dynamic Ground Water Resources of India, 2025, Karnataka’s annual groundwater recharge is estimated at 19.27 bcm, while extractable resources stand at 17.41 bcm. While recharge and extractable resources have increased marginally from 2024, extraction has also risen slightly. Overall, the state has seen a modest improvement, with extraction levels dropping from 68.44% in 2024 to 66.49% in 2025.Central Maharashtra, a drought-prone region receiving only 400–700 mm of rainfall annually, remains heavily dependent on groundwater. The state’s annual groundwater recharge is estimated at 33.89 bcm, with extractable resources of 31.99 bcm. Extraction stands at 16.57 bcm, translating to a stage of extraction of 51.79% — a slight improvement from 2024.Punjab remains among the most over-exploited states. Its annual groundwater extraction (26.27 bcm) far exceeds its extractable resource (16.8 bcm), pushing the stage of groundwater extraction to 156.36%.Although extraction has marginally declined from 2024, the state continues to draw far more water than it replenishes, largely due to water-intensive agriculture.Rajasthan’s groundwater situation is similarly alarming. With an annual extraction of 17.10 bcm against extractable resources of 11.62 bcm, the stage of extraction stands at 147.11%. Despite slight improvements in recharge, over-extraction remains entrenched.Delhi’s groundwater extraction stands at 92.10%, placing it in the critical category. While extraction has reduced slightly since 2024, the city remains heavily dependent on groundwater to meet domestic demand.address India’s growing water crisis, the government has rolled out a series of initiatives aimed at conservation, recharge, and equitable access to water. One of the key programmes is the Jal Shakti Abhiyan (JSA), launched in 2019 as a nationwide movement to promote water conservation, groundwater recharge and rainwater harvesting.Another major intervention is the Atal Bhujal Yojana, which emphasises sustainable groundwater management through community participation, improved recharge and regulated extraction.In urban areas, the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) 2.0 supports rainwater harvesting through stormwater drainage systems and promotes groundwater recharge via aquifer management plans.The Centre has also launched the Amrit Sarovar initiative, under which 50,000 water bodies, each roughly one acre in size, are being developed across the country to enhance local water storage and recharge.To improve transparency and monitoring, the Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) has developed a GIS-based public platform called the India Groundwater Resource Estimation System (IN-GRES). The portal visualises groundwater recharge, extraction, rainfall and categorisation at the level of individual assessment units, allowing comparisons with previous years.Yet, even as policies and programmes expand on paper, a parallel and troubling reality persists.India’s water crisis is not just about scarcity, but governance. Groundwater ownership laws dating back to the Easement Act of 1882 allow landowners to extract water beneath their land with few restrictions.Fragmented water management, weak enforcement and limited public awareness have allowed overuse to continue unchecked.While government initiatives, from the Jal Shakti Abhiyan and Atal Bhujal Yojana to large-scale rainwater harvesting and aquifer mapping programmes, aim to reverse the trend, experts may warn that without behavioural change and strict regulation, these measures may not be enough.Water budgeting, which treats water like a financial account, balancing availability against demand is also increasingly being seen as a crucial tool to identify stressed regions before they reach breaking point.Tankers extract water from over-exploited aquifers, frequently without regulation or quality checks, accelerating depletion while raising concerns over contamination.For now, the scenes of tankers, queues and dried wells serve as a warning. India may not be out of water yet, but in many places, it is running out of time. This underground trade, operating largely unchecked risks pushing India towards a long-term groundwater collapse tomorrow.","NITI Aayog has warned that 21 major Indian cities, including Delhi, Bengaluru and Chennai, face the risk of depleting their groundwater reserves.

Dhaka assures foreign missions of 'robust security'

NEW DELHI: India resumed operations at its visa application centre in Bangladesh's Dhaka on Thursday, a day after the facility was temporarily shut following a march by a large group of anti-India protesters towards the Indian High Commission, which was stopped by police.“The Indian Visa Application Centre (IVAC) in Dhaka is now operational and functioning normally,” an IVAC official told news agency PTI.However, the visa facilities in Khulna and Rajshahi were closed due to ""security concerns."" In a notice on its website, the IVAC said, “In view of the ongoing security situation, IVAC Rajshahi and Khulna will remain closed today. All applicants with appointments scheduled for today will be allotted fresh slots at a later date.”Bangladesh has five visa centres for those applying to travel to India. While the Dhaka centre - located at Jamuna Future Park in the country's capital and largest city - and the IVAC in Chattogram - the second-largest city - are currently operational, the facilities in Khulna and Rajshahi are closed. The fifth one is in Sylhet.Earlier on Wednesday, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) summoned Bangladesh's high commissioner to India, Riaz Hamidullah, and conveyed its “strong concern” over announcements by certain extremist elements to create a security situation around the Indian mission in Dhaka.“We expect the interim government to ensure the safety of missions and posts in Bangladesh in keeping with its diplomatic obligations,” the MEA said, adding that the envoy was apprised of India’s “strong concerns about the deteriorating security environment in Bangladesh.”Hamidullah was also told that New Delhi expects the Muhammad Yunus-led interim government to ensure the safety of missions and posts in Bangladesh in keeping with its diplomatic obligations.In Dhaka, hundreds of protesters under the banner of “July Oikya” (July Unity) began a march towards the Indian High Commission on Wednesday afternoon, raising anti-India slogans and pressing several demands, including an end to what they described as “anti-Bangladesh conspiracies” and the return of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina.Hasina fled Bangladesh last year following the student-led “July Uprising” against her government. After resigning and leaving the country on August 5, she has since been living in New Delhi.Meanwhile, Bangladesh’s foreign secretary, Asad Alam Siam, met foreign diplomats on Thursday, assuring them of the security of their missions and the maintenance of law and order ahead of the national election scheduled for February 12 next year, the Daily Star reported Foreign diplomats were also informed that the Election Commission would ""welcome"" election observers from abroad.Around 40 diplomats from the embassies located in Dhaka were present at the briefing.","India resumed operations at its visa application centre in Bangladesh's Dhaka on Thursday.

India Speeds Up Visas For Chinese Businesses Amid Thaw In Ties; Beijing Calls It 'Positive Move'

China is reportedly pressing ahead with a massive hydropower project on the Yarlung Tsangpo river in Tibet, a move that experts and officials warn could seriously endanger water security, ecology and livelihoods downstream in India. As the river enters India as the Brahmaputra, any large-scale intervention upstream is seen as a direct risk to millions who depend on its natural flow.According to CNN, the proposed $168bn hydropower system will harness a steep 2,000 metre drop in altitude through an intricate network of dams, reservoirs, tunnels and underground power stations.For India, the concern is not just environmental.Arunachal Pradesh chief minister Pema Khandu had warned that the project could be used as a “ticking water bomb”, with China potentially controlling the timing and volume of water released into the Brahmaputra. Sudden discharges could trigger floods, while withholding water could dry out large stretches of the river during critical periods.Minister of state for external affairs, Kirti Vardhan Singh in August had issued a statement on the project stating that they are consistently monitoring the developments related to the Brahmaputra river.""The Government of India has taken note of reports about the commencement of construction of the mega dam project by China on the lower reaches of the Yarlung Tsangpo (upper reaches of the Brahmaputra) River in Tibet.This project was first made public as far back as 1986 and since then, preparations have been underway in China,"" the MEA had stated in response to an unstarred question in the Rajya Sabha.The MEA said that the government remained committed to safeguarding Indian interests in the region.""Government carefully monitors all developments relating to the Brahmaputra river, including plans by China to develop hydropower projects, and takes necessary measures to protect our interests, including preventive and corrective measures to safeguard life and livelihood of Indian citizens residing in downstream areas,"" the statement said.Much of the Brahmaputra’s water comes from monsoon rains and tributaries within India. However, CNN reports expert's claim that upstream manipulation can still disturb the river’s natural rhythm. Even limited changes could affect fertile floodplains, fisheries and groundwater recharge across Assam and Arunachal Pradesh, regions already vulnerable to climate stress.China has dismissed these concerns, as the Chinese foreign ministry has insisted that downstream countries will not be adversely affected.The technical scale of the project has also heightened fears. CNN quotes Brian Eyler, director of the Energy, Water and Sustainability Program at the Stimson Center in Washington, has described it as the most sophisticated hydropower system ever attempted, but also one of the riskiest.Any failure or miscalculation in such a seismically sensitive and ecologically fragile region could have cascading consequences downstream.Beijing’s management of the Mekong River has drawn repeated criticism from downstream nations, which accuse Chinese dam operators of worsening droughts by regulating water flow to suit power generation needs.The upstream developments have prompted India’s largest state-run hydropower company to push ahead with its own 11,200-megawatt project on the Brahmaputra, a move driven partly by fears of losing strategic and water security ground.Experts warn that competing mega projects on the same river system could worsen risks for both countries. Without cooperation and transparency, analysts caution, a dam-building race between India and China could undermine regional stability and place the future of the Brahmaputra and the millions who rely on it in jeopardy.","China is reportedly pressing ahead with a massive hydropower project on the Yarlung Tsangpo river in Tibet.

End Of MGNREGA? What VB–G Ram G Means For Rural Workers, Farmers And Viksit Bharat Plan

Also Read |

NEW DELHI: The Lok Sabha on Thursday passed the Viksit Bharat Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) Bill amid sustained opposition protests, leading to repeated disruptions and the adjournment of the House after a ruckus.The Bill, which replaces the 20-year-old Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act , seeks to provide a statutory guarantee of 125 days of wage employment in a financial year to every rural household whose adult members volunteer to undertake unskilled manual work.Moving the Bill for consideration and passage, Union rural development minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said the legislation would ensure employment and help fulfil Mahatma Gandhi’s vision of self-reliant villages. He said the VB-G RAM G Bill would ensure all-round development of villages, make them poverty-free and fuel their growth journey.Opposition parties, however, mounted a sharp attack on the government over the repeal and renaming of MGNREGA. Trinamool Congress MP Mahua Moitra accused the government of undermining Gandhi’s legacy. She said the Bill was destroying the idea of Ram Rajya both in letter and spirit by repealing MGNREGA and renaming the scheme.Moitra also accused the government of “dishonouring” Mahatma Gandhi and Rabindranath Tagore by removing Gandhi’s name from the landmark rural employment law. Taking a swipe at the ruling dispensation, she said the Bill showed that the government believed in “Na kisi ka saath, na kisi ka vikas, na Rahim ka, na Ram ka”.Opposing the Bill, she said the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act of 2005 had revolutionised rural India’s concept of livelihood security.Congress MP Jai Prakash said removing the name of the Father of the Nation from the legislation was “the biggest crime”. He claimed the proposed law would create fresh financial liabilities for states and deprive grassroots institutions such as gram sabhas of their right to decide on works under the scheme. He termed the Bill “anti-poor” and “anti-Dalit”, alleging it reflected a pro-rich approach.Speaker Om Birla had earlier said the debate on the Bill would take place on Wednesday, with the minister replying on Thursday before it was taken up for passage.Defending the legislation, BJP MP Brijmohan Agarwal said the previous Congress government had reduced MNREGA to a “dig the pit and cover the pit” scheme. He alleged it failed to strengthen the rural economy and led to large-scale corruption. Agarwal said the inclusion of “Ram” in the new law would deter corruption.According to the Bill, states will be required to frame schemes consistent with the new law within six months of the Act coming into force.",The Lok Sabha on Thursday passed the Viksit Bharat Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) Bill. The Bill replaces the 20-year-old Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday modified its earlier order restraining Delhi and NCR authorities from taking coercive action against ""end-of-life"" vehicles - 10-year-old diesel and 15-year-old petrol vehicles - and said the reprieve would apply only to BS 4 or BS 6 emission norm-compliant vehicles.This order will impact over 14.7 lakh BS 1 compliant cars, three-wheelers, two-wheelers, buses and goods carriers; more than 38.7 lakh BS 2 compliant ones; and another 53.7 lakh BS 3 vehicles. A bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justices Joymalya Bagchi and Vipul M Pancholi passed the order on an application by Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM).Need to restrict plying of vehicles on basis of BS standards: CAQMOn Aug 12, an SC bench led by then CJI B R Gavai had said, “We direct that no coercive steps be taken against owners of vehicles on the ground that these are 10 years old (in case of diesel) and 15 years old (in case of petrol).”Additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati said BS 1, BS 2 and BS 3 vehicles have completed 24 years, 20 years and 15 years, respectively, and are a major cause of air pollution in Delhi-NCR. The CAQM said a BS 1 diesel vehicle produces 5.4 times more CO (BS-2 two times more and BS-3 1.28 times more), 12.13 times more NOx (BS-2 8.75 times more and BS-3 6.25 times more) and 31.11 times more PM (BS-2 18 times and BS-3 2.3 times more) than a BS 4 compliant diesel vehicle.Agreeing to modify its Aug-12 order that had asked the authorities not to take coercive measures against end-of-life vehicles, the bench said only vehicles which are BS 4 and BS 6 compliant would not be proceeded against if they are older than 15 years.The CAQM, in its affidavit, said, “One of the criteria determining the fitness of a vehicle is its emissions. The emissions of any vehicle are tested against its BS standard category. Thus, an otherwise fit vehicle would still be emitting pollutants as per its BS standard. Since Delhi-NCR faces an extraordinary situation, especially during the winter season due to poor dispersal of pollutants on account of unfavourable meteorological conditions, there is a need to restrict the plying of polluting vehicles based on emission standards in Delhi-NCR. ”In compliance with orders of SC and National Green Tribunal, CAQM had issued a directive on July 8 mandating retail outlets to refuse fuel to all end-of-life vehicles with effect from Nov 1 this year in Delhi and from April 1, 2026, in five high-vehicle-density districts contiguous to Delhi, besides other actions in accordance with law.","The Supreme Court modified its earlier order restraining Delhi and NCR authorities from taking coercive action against ""end-of-life"" vehicles. The reprieve would apply only to BS 4 or BS 6 emission norm-compliant vehicles. This order will impact over 14.7 lakh BS 1 compliant cars, three-wheelers, two- wheelers, buses and goods carriers.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126045143,imgsize-44316,width-400,resizemode-4/screenshot-2025-12-18-011018.jpg"

NEW DELHI: The string of landmark judgments on gender equality could not help Shyla Joseph get an equitable 1/9th share of the property of her father N S Sreedharan, who had nine children but in his will disinherited her for marrying outside the community.A Supreme Court bench of Justices Ahsanuddin Amanullah and K Vinod Chandran reversed the concurrent findings of the HC and the trial court which had doubted the will and allowed equitable partition of Sreedharan's property among the nine children, including Shyla.Writing the judgment, Justice Chandran said, ""There can be no interference to the will which stands proved unequivocally. The judgment and decree of the high court and that of the trial court stands set aside. The plaintiff (Shyla) is found to have no claim over the properties of her father, which by a will have been bequeathed to the other siblings of the plaintiff.""Once the SC doubted the claim, senior advocate P B Krishnan, appearing for Shyla, requested the bench that her entitlement at best was just 1/9th share of her father's assets which is a negligible portion of the properties.The bench said the question of equality does not arise in a case relating to the wish of a man about division and inheritance of his properties.It said, ""We are not on equity, and the wish of the testator assumes pre-eminence. The last will and testament of the testator cannot be digressed from or frustrated."" While allowing the appeal of her siblings, the bench ordered dismissal of the suit she had filed for equitable partition of her father's properties.It said the rule of prudence cannot apply to the contents of a will, which is the wish of the individual who has absolute discretion to divide his properties. If all siblings had been divested of their inheritance through a will, then the rule of prudence could have been applied by the courts, the bench said.Referring to the reason for which Sreedharan had disinherited Shyla, the SC said, ""There is a reason stated for such exclusion, the acceptability of which to our minds, is not what the rule of prudence dictates. We cannot put the testator in our shoes... We cannot substitute our opinions in place of that of the testator; his desire prompted by his own justifications.""",Shyla Joseph was disinherited by her father N S Sreedharan for marrying outside the community.

With their reappointments being linked to vacancy status, there was little that HC chief justices could do to proceed further on the issue. These conditions were relaxed on Jan 30 this year. Yet, there has been no ad hoc appointment of retired judges to high courts.A bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justices Joymalya Bagchi and Vipul M Pancholi was informed by senior advocate K Parameswaran that the seniority of retired judges and the question of who would head benches, the retired judge or the sitting judge junior to them, was stopping HCs from recommending names for reappointment.CJI Kant accepted that this was one of the stumbling blocks for high court chief justices as ""I have discovered while interacting with them during the last few months"".The bench then decided to empower high court chief justices to persuade a sitting judge to sit on a bench headed by a retired HC judge on their reappointment as ad hoc judge.""In modification of Jan 30 order, it is clarified that if there are two ad hoc judges appointed in the HC, it will be the prerogative of the CJ to constitute a division bench. Similarly, it will be the discretion of the CJ to constitute a bench consisting of an advocate or a sitting judge wherever necessary and resolve at his level as to who would preside over the bench in the manner as may be agreeable to both judges,"" the bench said.Attorney general R Venkataramani said the memorandum of procedure for appointment of judges provides for the mechanism for such appointments and if any problem or issue arises, he would deliberate on the matter and get back to the court.Under Article 224A of the Constitution, the chief justice of a high court may at any time, with the previous consent of the President, request any person who has held the office of a judge of that court or of any other high court, to sit and act as a judge of the high court of that state. The process for appointment of ad hoc judges would be similar to that for appointment of regular judges under the Collegium system.From a pendency of 38.7 lakh cases in HCs in 2015, the number went up to 57.5 lakh in 2021. At present, the pendency in HCs stands at 63.6 lakh, of which nearly 19 lakh are criminal cases.","Supreme Court said a huge pool of talent in retired high court judges could be utilised through reappointment as ad hoc judges.

NEW DELHI: The passage of the contentious 'VB-G RAM G' bill in Parliament has set the stage for protest politics. As Modi govt rebuffed pressure to refer the bill to the standing committee on rural development for vetting, Congress MP Saptagiri Ulaka told TOI that BJP was wary of the panel because it is headed by him, an opposition member.In what signals a Congress bid to turn the ""dilution"" of jobs guarantee into a nationwide rallying cry against BJP, Congress Working Committee will discuss MGNREGA at a special session on Dec 27. Sources said a plan for protest may also be discussed during the brainstorming. The joint opposition Thursday took out a march in the Parliament complex, with MPs walking behind a huge banner of ""Mahatma Gandhi - NREGA"", raising slogans against the govt.Ulaka told TOI, ""The only reason why govt was scared of the standing committee on RD is that a Congress MP is its chairman. They just wanted to avoid it. They were scared because of the reports we have been submitting. They were worried, though I don't know why.""He said BJP's partisan considerations are the reason why Modi govt prefers to send legislations to JPCs instead of standing committees, because the former are headed by ""dummies"" with whom ""things get done"".Ulaka wrote to Speaker Om Birla that the bill be sent to his panel for scrutiny, while the opposition voiced demand during the debate on the legislation.There is a belief in Congress that it can use 'disbanding' of MGNREGA to reach out to the rural poor and create an agitation on the lines of the one in 2015 against Modi govt's proposed amendments to Land Acquisition Amendment Act, that forced the governing party to roll back its plan. The CWC tone will decide if the party has the appetite for mass mobilisation, given that it has struggled to mount a serious resistance against BJP in the recent months.

Parliament on Friday cleared the Viksit Bharat – Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) or VB-G Ram G Bill, 2025, with the Rajya Sabha passing the legislation hours after its approval in the Lok Sabha, amid strong opposition protests and repeated demands for scrutiny by a parliamentary committee.Earlier, the lower house passed the Bill on Thursday.Replying to the debate in the Lok Sabha, Rural Development Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said the new law substantially improves upon MGNREGA, which he described as having been “riddled with corruption and inefficiency”.He said the revamped scheme seeks to move beyond wage payments to focus on creation of durable rural assets, while also making implementation more transparent.Opposition members, led by Congress MPs, protested against the bill, alleging that the government had removed Mahatma Gandhi’s name from the rural employment guarantee framework.Also Read: MGNREGA to be replaced with VB–G Ram G: What it is and how it’s different — key FAQs answered As demands to refer the bill to a committee were rejected, opposition MPs entered the well of the House, tore copies of the bill and continued demonstrations until its passage.Rejecting the criticism, Chouhan said Mahatma Gandhi’s name was not part of the original 2005 legislation and was added only in 2009.Turning the charge back on the Congress, he said numerous schemes, institutions and awards had been named after members of the Nehru-Gandhi family, citing figures to underline his point.The minister said the government has allocated over Rs 1.5 lakh crore for the scheme, with the Centre’s share exceeding Rs 95,000 crore. Addressing concerns over states bearing 40% of the expenditure, he said both the Centre and states share responsibility for development.Chouhan accused the opposition of turning parliamentary debate into “bheedtantra and goondatantra” and criticised the conduct of Congress leaders during the discussion.

NEW DELHI: Rural development minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said Thursday 'VB-G Ram G' bill improves substantially on MGNREGA, which was ""riddled"" by corruption and inefficiency, as Lok Sabha passed the draft law amid fierce protests from opposition. They demanded that bill be sent to a parliamentary committee for scrutiny and assailed govt for removing Mahatma Gandhi 's name from rural employment guarantee scheme.As Chouhan began his reply after Congress MP KC Venugopal's demand for sending Viksit Bharat-Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission-Gramin (VB-G RAM G) Bill to the committee went unheeded, opposition members trooped into the well, tore its copies and continued their protest till the House passed the bill.Rejecting opposition’s criticism, including removing Mahatma Gandhi’s name, rural development minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan turned to Congress MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s barbed attack on govt for its obsession with changing names and said if anyone suffered from such a proclivity it was Congress, as scores of places, schemes, awards and events were named after members of the Nehru-Gandhi family.There were 25 and 27 schemes in states named after Rajiv Gandhi & Indira Gandhi, while educational institutions named after Rajiv, Indira and Jawaharlal Nehru numbered 55, 21 and 22, respectively, he said, reeling out more data.Unruly protest by Congress MPs and tearing copies of the bill amounts to killing Mahatma Gandhi’s ideals, Chouhan claimed, adding his (Gandhi’s) name was not part of the original 2005 legislation and added in 2009.He said the bill was brought after extensive deliberations as it was felt such massive amounts should not be spent on merely paying wages but used for creating permanent assets as well, while making the programme more transparent. Govt has allocated over Rs 1.5 lakh crore for the scheme and Centre’s share alone be over Rs 95,000 crore, he said. In remarks after the bill’s passage, he denounced opposition for its protest, saying it has turned democracy into “bheedtantra (mobocracy) and goondatantra (hooliganism)”.Rahul Gandhi, he said, has robbed his position of LoP with his conduct, including his current visit abroad when Parliament is discussing key legislations. On the criticism that the bill burdens states with 40% of expenditure, he said both Centre and states are responsible for development. MGNREGA had many shortcomings, some states at times were more interested in drawing funds from Centre and cutting down on their share in expenses of material. One ditch after another was dug up, he said.He told LS, “We have made provisions to improve employment. This vast amount of money will be used to build fully-developed villages,” he said, adding the central sector scheme will be used to ensure water security by creating ponds, irrigation channels and rural infrastructure.

The Commission for Air Quality Management has directed civic bodies and state agencies across the National Capital Region to urgently strengthen municipal solid waste management, flagging persistent open burning of waste, delays in clearing legacy dumps and gaps in enforcement.The directions came after a detailed review of waste management systems in Delhi and NCR states, conducted through a series of meetings with state governments, municipal bodies and pollution control boards.The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) said waste management remains a critical area requiring sustained attention because of its direct impact on air pollution.In Delhi, the CAQM noted continued incidents of open municipal solid waste and biomass burning despite the availability of infrastructure.It directed the Municipal Corporation of Delhi to complete remediation of 143.09 lakh metric tonnes of legacy waste by December 2027, at a processing rate of about 3.5 lakh metric tonnes per month, and to submit monthly progress reports.The commission also ordered immediate augmentation of waste-processing facilities without extending timelines and asked for stronger surveillance of garbage-vulnerable points, spill-free transportation of waste and intensified door-to-door segregation drives.Bulk waste generators in Delhi have been asked to ensure on-site wet waste processing within one month, while the rollout of the zero-waste colonies is to be accelerated.The Delhi Pollution Control Committee has been tasked with strict monitoring of waste-to-energy plants, fly ash disposal, verification of municipal data and monthly compliance reporting to the CAQM.In Haryana, the commission flagged significant delays in legacy waste remediation and processing infrastructure, particularly in Gurugram, Faridabad and Sonipat.Gurugram's municipal corporation has been directed to complete tendering for the remediation of 14 lakh metric tonnes of legacy waste by January 20, 2026, and to start biomining by March 31, 2026.Faridabad has been asked to identify land for decentralised processing facilities within two months and make them operational by April 2026.In Uttar Pradesh's NCR areas, the CAQM observed delays in legacy waste remediation, uneven segregation and coordination gaps.Authorities in Noida, Greater Noida and Ghaziabad have been told to complete remediation within committed timelines and not to seek further extensions for commissioning processing facilities.In Rajasthan's NCR districts, including Bharatpur, Alwar and Bhiwadi, progress on waste remediation and segregation was found inadequate.Urban local bodies have been directed to complete remediation within timelines and strengthen segregation, surveillance and complaint redressal.The commission said it will closely monitor compliance, carry out follow-up reviews and take action wherever required.","The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) said waste management remains a critical area requiring sustained attention because of its direct impact on air pollution.

From Power Cuts To 500 GW Grid, India Emerges As Global Data Centre Hub Under Modi: Piyush Goyal

NEW DELHI: The Lok Sabha on Wednesday gave its nod to the the nuclear energy bill called the ""Sustainable Harnessing and Advancement of Nuclear Energy for Transforming India Bill (SHANTI), 2025"". The bill was passed as opposition staged a walkout, during the ongoing Winter Session.The amended bill was tabled in the lower house, with introduction by MoS for department of atomic energy Jitendra Singh in the House on Monday, signifying a policy shift in the atomic sector operations. The bill allows entry of private players into the industry, something that was reserved for government enterprises till now. Singh said that it provides for “a pragmatic civil liability regime for nuclear damage and to confer statutory status to Atomic Energy Regulatory Board. ""The proposed legislation further aims to facilitate significant growth in nuclear energy and its applications across multiple sectors. This aligns with country's target to establish 100GW of nuclear power capacity by 2047. The law introduces fresh regulatory provisions encompassing updated safety protocols, a specialised nuclear tribunal for resolving disputes, and modifications to the nuclear liability framework to limit risks and encourage investments.The proposed legislation permits private enterprises and their collaborative ventures to seek authorisation for establishing and running nuclear facilities, as well as transporting nuclear fuel. However, crucial operations including uranium enrichment, spent fuel handling and heavy water manufacturing shall continue to be exclusively managed by the Central government. The Centre will maintain oversight of radioactive materials and radiation-producing apparatus to ensure proper safety standards.","The bill was passed as opposition staged a walkout, during the ongoing Winter Session.

Yogi Adityanath Targets Nehru Over Kashmir, Links Historic Blunder To India’s Long Terror Crisis

New Delhi: Asserting that “51 cartons of Jawaharlal Nehru papers” were formally taken back by the “family” in 2008 from Prime Ministers’ Museum and Library (then Nehru Memorial Museum and Library), culture minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat lashed out at Congress asking its senior leader Sonia Gandhi “why have these papers not been returned despite multiple reminders from PMML including the recent reminders in January and July this year”.Pointing out that Gandhi herself has acknowledged in writing that these papers are with her and promised to ""cooperate"" on the matter, Shekhawat sought that Gandhi honour her commitment and return these papers to PMML.Shekhawat’s sharp rebuke came a day after Congress spokesman and senior leader Jairam Ramesh asked “will there be an apology forthcoming” citing the govt’s reply to a question in Lok Sabha that no papers relating to Jawaharlal Nehru were found missing in the annual inspection of PMML.“In reality, 51 cartons of Jawaharlal Nehru papers were formally taken back by the family in 2008 from PMML (then Nehru Memorial Museum and Library). Their location is known. Hence, they are “not missing”,” Shekhawat said in a post on X.“These are not private family papers. They relate to the first Prime Minister of India and form part of our national historical record. Such papers belong in public archives, not behind closed doors,” Shekhawat said in a post on X.The ministry of culture cited a April 29, 2008 letter wherein it was requested that Gandhi wished to take back all of the private family letters and notes of former PM Jawahar Lal Nehru. Accordingly, the papers were sent to Gandhi.“I respectfully ask Sonia Gandhi ji to explain to the country: What is being withheld? What is being hidden?,” Shekhawat asked and said that the “excuses” being given by Sonia for not returning these papers are “not tenable”.“History cannot be curated selectively,” Shekhawat said and added that “transparency is the foundation of democracy and archival openness is its moral obligation which Mrs Gandhi and the “family” need to uphold”.Shekhawat in his reply to Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh’s post said, “The truth placed before the Lok Sabha is clear and on record"". ”The Nehru Papers were taken out in 2008, during the UPA period, when public institutions were often treated as family preserves,"" he said.“In fact it would be more appropriate for you to urge Sonia Gandhi to honour her commitment and return these papers to PMML so that scholars, citizens, and the Parliament can access these crucial historical records and the truth of ""Nehruvian"" times can be examined objectively,” Shekhawat said to Ramesh.","Culture minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat lashed out at Congress.

'Paid Campaign': Nitin Gadkari Slams Criticism Of E20 Program; Calls It 'Politically Motivated'

New Delhi: Highway commuters won’t have to stop to pay user fee at national highway toll plazas by 2026-end as the govt rolls out the multi-lane free flow (MLFF) system, road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari said on Wednesday. He added that the FASTag annual pass launched in Aug, which allows private vehicles to cross 200 plazas, has also come as a big relief for people.Gadkari said over 40 lakh private car owners have subscribed to the FASTag annual pass. “People will be rid of stopping or slowing down at toll plazas as we roll out the MLFF toll system. Cameras above the road will read the number plate and user fee will be automatically debited from the vehicle FASTag account. All this will happen even when someone is driving at a speed of 80 kmph. I made this announcement in Rajya Sabha today,” he said.Earlier in the day, he said in RS that the new system will help save fuel worth Rs 1,500 crore and increase toll revenue by Rs 6,000 crore. The system will make toll collection transparent and corruption-free, he said.Gadkari also said that a system is being put in place where vehicle owners will have to clear all dues, including pending toll fee and e-challans when they sell their vehicles or renew registration.On the next major focus of highway development in the country, Gadkari said that now there is more thrust on building greenfield highways, which is key to reduce logistics cost. “In India, earlier the logistics cost was 16%. But the latest study by IIM-Bangalore, IIT-Kanpur and IIT-Madras indicates that our logistics cost on road has reduced by 6%. The report was out three-four months back. So, I am confident that by now this logistics cost is in single digit at 9%,” he said.He said govt’s focus on infrastructure is driving India’s economic growth. “For the growth of any country, infrastructure is important. Roads, water, power, transport and communication, without developing this infrastructure, we can’t get capital investment in industry and trade & business. And, without investment, we cannot create jobs... Without jobs, we cannot eradicate poverty,” he added.","Gadkari said over 40 lakh private car owners have subscribed to the FASTag annual pass.

Later in the day, the labour department issued an advisory reiterating the restrictions, adding that ""non-compliance is punishable under sections 15 and 16 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, and other applicable laws"".The WFH provisions will not apply to essential services, including hospitals and health services, fire services, prison administration, public transport, electricity services, pollution control departments, forest department and Delhi Jal Board.The govt also announced that it will pay 10,000 to each of the registered construction workers in Delhi because of the 16-day halt in construction work due to Grap provisions aimed at curbing air pollution.In response to worsening air quality, Delhi govt has imposed Grap 4, the highest and strictest stage of Delhi-NCR's pollution control plan. Under Grap 4, construction and demolition activities have been banned, diesel trucks not carrying essential goods have been barred from entering Delhi and govt has announced it will not give fuel to non-PUC compliant vehicles.Mishra said in addition to making 50% WFH mandatory, offices are also being encouraged to adopt flexible working hours.During the period of Grap restrictions last month, construction activities in Delhi were suspended, which adversely affected the livelihoods of daily-wage construction workers. ""Taking this concern into account, Delhi govt has decided to compensate workers for the loss of income caused by the suspension of construction work.

Paul Heyman’s estimated net worth in 2025 and income sources

Marla Heyman’s financial profile and the combined net worth question

Paul Heyman has been one of wrestling's most influential people, shaping eras in ECW and WWE. With his consistent presence both on-screen and behind the scenes on WWE programming, interest in his finances has been rekindled in 2025, raising questions regarding his own wealth and whether or not he even has a combined net worth with his previous wife, Marla Heyman.While entertainment finance outlets regularly estimate Paul Heyman’s earnings, his wife, Marla Heyman, has been able to keep her life quite private, and there are no financial records available to review. Therefore, any conversation about a joint net worth is based on confirmed reporting for Paul Heyman, and the lack of available information is not representative of Marla.According to entertainment finance trackers like Celebrity Net Worth, Paul Heyman's net worth is around $10 million. While not officially verified by WWE or Heyman himself, these numbers are frequently referenced in wrestling media circles.That fortune he has accumulated is largely down to his deep ties to WWE. Wrestling observers associated outlets have covered the subject of Heyman's WWE salary, which was recently reported to be as high as about $2 million per year based on both his onscreen character as well as his offscreen creative prowess.His association with The Bloodline storyline over the past few years has increased this company's cash cow status.Part of Heyman's legacy includes his earlier years with Extreme Championship Wrestling, but not in a good way. Quotes about ECW from court records and wrestling business historians have reported that ECW had declared bankruptcy in the early 00s while also holding a large sum of debt. Though WWE would subsequently purchase ECW's video library and intellectual property and later reinstate the brand's historical significance, this did not equate to a massive paycheck for Heyman personally at the time.Marla Heyman is still not prominent in public financial disclosures. Biographical databases and celebrity background websites have never made clear what her career entailed and what her sources of income were, so assigning an accurate net worth is not possible.Therefore, any assertions of Paul and Marla Heyman's net worth in 2025 should be taken with a grain of salt. Given the reporting available, the only reasonable conclusion is that Paul Heyman has an independently estimated net worth of around $10 million in addition to whatever Marla Heyman has.Also Read: Paul Heyman reveals his new WWE nickname","According to entertainment finance trackers like Celebrity Net Worth, Paul Heyman's net worth is around $10 million.

Elon Musk’s rapid rise: From $24 billion to the brink of trillionaire status









Elon Musk has reached a historical financial milestone, as he has become the first-ever person to ever achieve a net worth that surpasses the whopping figure of $600 billion, as reported in Forbes magazine. This milestone has been achieved during a time when there is newfound interest in his privately owned rocket company, SpaceX, which he believes will make a historical initial start detailing a whopping value of $800 billion with an initial public offering that could potentially take place in 2026.Musk's net worth has not only increased with his involvement with his rocket company, SpaceX, but he has earned a tremendous amount of money with his investment in electric cars with his company, Tesla, where his net worth has increased by a whopping 12% because of his investment in his own artificial intelligence company, xAI.As reported by Forbes, Elon Musk has now broken yet another record by being the first individual to ever reach a net worth of over $600 billion. This achievement has come at a time when his private rocket company, SpaceX, has seen a tremendous rise in market value, with plans of an initial public offering in 2026. Musk's net worth is also contributed by his stake of 12% in Tesla, an electric vehicle behemoth, and his artificial intelligence company, xAI, both of which keep increasing in value.From groundbreaking innovations in space travel and electric mobility to ambitious AI projects, futuristic ventures, and global business expansions, Musk’s diversified portfolio and relentless pursuit of technological advancement have cemented his status as the world’s richest person.SpaceX has also showcased its role in the increasing wealth of Musk to historic levels. With an estimated 42% stake in the firm, the net worth of Musk is expected to grow by an enormous $168 billion if SpaceX continues to retain its current valuation of $800 billion. Analysts also expect it to reach a valuation of $1.5 trillion when it comes to the public market and possibly become the first trillionaire in the world. The innovative nature of SpaceX in terms of its rocket and satellite launches continues to impress the market while affecting the net worth of its CEO.Tesla stock is still an integral part of Musk’s financial network. His current stake of about 12% in Tesla is valued at $197 billion without taking into consideration the stock options from the 2018 CEO Performance Award that are still winding their way through litigation. Apart from that, Tesla shareholders have just approved what is considered the largest compensation deal of $1 trillion that is pegged on meeting various performance goals, including doubling the current market capitalization eightfold in ten years.Musk’s AI company, xAI, is also a significant contributor to his net worth. In the advanced talk of raising funding worth $15 billion in fresh equity, the firm is placed at a value of $230 billion. Musk owns about 53% of the firm’s stakes under xAI Holdings, meaning he has a net worth of about $60 billion. AI is another major sector into which Musk has ventured.Musk's emergence to $600 billion in a short span of time can be noted. He started with $24.6 billion in March 2020 and broke the $100 billion mark later in the same year, and reached $190 billion in January 2021. He broke many records in the last five years with his wealth and became the first person to break $500 billion in October 2025. At present, he leads the richest people in the world by a very large margin of $425 billion over Google co-founder Larry Page and is soon to reach $700 billion.","Elon Musk has become the first person to ever achieve a net worth that surpasses the whopping figure of $600 billion.

Blood tests can specifically show the presence of antigens or antibodies that fight pigeon-related infection. We even use skin prick tests for pigeon-related allergies,"" said Dr Anusha CM, consultant (respiratory medicine), Manipal Hospital, Malleswaram.She said such cases, which were rare even two years ago, have become routine now. ""These cases are especially common among apartment dwellers and office-goers, as the pigeon population is higher in high-rise buildings.""Initial symptoms in these cases are cough, allergic rhinitis, or asthma. However, prolonged exposure to pigeon feathers and droppings can lead to hypersensitivity pneumonitis — a severe lung condition that can lead to lung fibrosis, which causes the lungs to stiffen and shrink and consequently severely affect breathing function.""Treatment often requires long-term care, and some patients may eventually need home oxygen support,"" explained Dr Pragati Rao D, HOD & consultant, pulmonology (respiratory medicine), Ramaiah Memorial Hospital.Dr Sachin Kumar, director of pulmonology & critical care medicine, Sakra World Hospital, elaborated on a recent case that makes it clear how reducing exposure, or in severe cases, completely removing the causative agent (exposure to pigeons) is crucial. ""A 35-year-old man living in an apartment complex developed an ongoing cough and shortness of breath. The symptoms were noticeably worse when he worked from home. There was a pigeon infestation on the vacant upper floors of his building. A CT scan revealed interstitial lung disease, and meaningful improvement was seen only after the source of exposure was identified. Thorough cleaning of the affected areas and preventive steps to stop pigeon nesting led to a clear reduction in his symptoms,"" he said.Doctors also underscored that even those who voluntarily feed pigeons are at risk of infection.","Bengaluru has long battled a pigeon menace, which doctors have linked to rising respiratory illnesses. However, the govt has denied that any pigeon-related infections have been recorded in Bengaluru. Meanwhile, pulmonologists paint a starkly different reality in their clinics.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126062816,imgsize-84114,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/pigeon-peril-in-bengaluru-dk-shivakumar-denies-health-risk-doctors-flag-cases-in-city.jpg"

Nvidia Makes History: First Company to Hit $4 Trillion Market Cap

Fear-driven leadership powers AI chip giant's success

Seven-day workweeks extend beyond executive suite





Despite leading the world's most valuable company with a $4.4 trillion market cap, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang operates in constant fear of failure. In a recent appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast, the 62-year-old executive revealed he works seven days a week in a perpetual ""state of anxiety"" about the company going bankrupt.""I'm not ambitious, I just want to stay alive,"" Huang told host Joe Rogan, explaining his 33-year mantra of running Nvidia as if it's ""30 days from going out of business."" The co-founder, who has led the chipmaker since 1993, said this feeling of vulnerability ""doesn't leave you"" despite the company's recent milestone of becoming the first public firm to reach a $5 trillion valuation in October.Huang's unconventional leadership approach stems from near-death experiences in the 1990s when Nvidia faced bankruptcy multiple times. He recalled flying to Japan to inform Sega that a contracted graphics chip was flawed and the deal should be canceled, while simultaneously admitting Nvidia needed the final $5 million payment to survive. Sega converted the funds into an investment, providing the lifeline that kept the company afloat.""I have a greater drive from not wanting to fail than the drive of wanting to succeed,"" Huang explained. The CEO maintains his intense work schedule by waking at 4 a.m.daily to read emails for hours, processing several thousand messages each day. This routine continues through holidays including Thanksgiving and Christmas.Huang's relentless work ethic has influenced his family, with both adult children Madison and Spencer working at Nvidia seven days a week. The siblings, who are in their 30s, initially pursued different careers before joining the company as interns in 2020 and 2022.Nvidia reported record revenue of $57 billion for its third quarter, driven by surging demand for AI chips that power technology from Microsoft, OpenAI and Meta. However, Huang told Rogan that scale hasn't changed his mindset: ""The sense of vulnerability, the sense of uncertainty, the sense of insecurity—it doesn't leave you.""","Jensen Huang, CEO of $4.4 trillion AI chip giant Nvidia, lives in constant fear of bankruptcy.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella’s joinery from Manipal





Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella once shared his experience of how not going to IIT which he describes as the ""the holy grail"" for middle-class students became a turning point for him. The IIT rejection redirected his life towards a path only few could have imagined and which eventually led him to become the CEO of Microsoft, one of the world’s most valuable companies. Speaking to LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky in 2023, Nadella revealed that as a teenage in Hyderabad his ambition revolved around cricket and banking. He said that he never thought of software. Nadella further added that like many of friends he also viewed IIT as the pinnacle of academic achievement. But when he failed to secure admission, Nadella faced a setback that could have easily defined his future. Instead, it became the catalyst for a different journey.Nadella described IIT as “the holy grail” for middle-class students, acknowledging the weight of expectations. Yet, he later reflected that not getting in forced him to explore other opportunities ones that ultimately shaped his resilience and adaptability.After getting rejected from IIT, Nadella got enrolled at the Manipal Institute of Technology, where he studied electrical engineering. The decision of taking admission in Manipal Institute of Technology set him on a trajectory that would take him to the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee for a master’s degree.After completing his masters he enrolled in the University of Chicago for an MBA.Nadella also recalled that after reaching the US he faced cultural shocks, homesickness and the challenge of proving himself in a new country. He said that he often joked about the fact that he simply cannot locate Milwaukee on a map before moving there. However, all these experiences helped him in building adaptability which later went ahead and defined his leadership style.Nadella joined Microsoft in 1992, after working at Sun Microsystems. Over, the next two decade he rose steadily through the ranks and the became the Microsoft CEO in 2014. When Nadella became the CEO, the company was facing a lot competition from Apple, Google and Amazon. However, under his leadership, Microsoft reinvented itself and it now a market valuation of $3.54 trillion.Nadella has often said that “only in America would someone like me get the chance to prove himself rather than be typecast based on the school I attended.”","Satya Nadella once shared his experience of how not going to IIT which he describes as the ""the holy grail"" for middle-class students became a turning point for him.

Why Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis thinks the AI startup valuation model is breaking,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-google-deepmind-ceo-demis-hassabis-thinks-the-ai-startup-valuation-model-is-breaking/articleshow/126055448.cms,"Big tech vs early-stage hype

'Trump Needs Indian Skilled Workers': Expert On Big Tech's AI Bet On India

Demis Hassabis makes his stand clear on AI scaling





Google DeepMind CEo Demis Hassabis has once again warned that the present wave of AI startup valuations is unsustainable. He also raised concerns that there are chances that the tech sector is heading towards a correction. Speaking on Google DeepMind: The Podcast, Hassabis said many early-stage companies are now raising tens of billions dollars before even launching product. He believes that this trend exposes cracks in the valuation model. “Some startups basically haven’t even got going yet,” Hassabis said. “It’s sort of interesting to see how can that be sustainable. My guess is probably not, at least not in general.” This increase in speculative funding has drawn comparisons to past bubbles, such as the dot-com boom and the crypto frenzy, where companies raised massive sums on hype rather than proven business models.Hassabis emphasised that these seed-stage valuations with investments by established companies like Google, which he said are backed by “a lot of real business.” While Big Tech’s AI bets are supported by revenue streams and infrastructure, many startups are relying solely on investor enthusiasm.He added that AI is “overhyped in the short term” but “underappreciated in the medium to long-term,” suggesting that while the technology’s potential is profound, the current funding frenzy may not reflect sustainable growth.Reflecting on DeepMind’s own early days, Hassabis noted how technological shifts often swing from skepticism to obsession, inflating valuations quickly. “It’s almost an overreaction to the underreaction,” he said, pointing out that investor sentiment can flip dramatically once a technology gains traction.Recently, Google DeepMind CEO also made his stand clear on the debate over how far AI scaling laws can take the industry.As reported by Business Insider, speaking at the Axios AI+ Summit in San Francisco, Hassabis said that scaling current systems must be pushed to the maximum, calling it a critical path towards artificial general intelligence (AGI). “The scaling of the current systems, we must push that to the maximum, because at the minimum, it will be a key component of the final AGI system. It could be the entirety of the AGI system,” Hassabis told the audience.AGI is still a theoretical form of AI which is capable of reasoning as well as humans. AGI is also the ultimate goal for leading AI companies that are driving billions in spending on infrastructure and talent.

Rupee continues to rebound! Currency makes its way back from the 90 level; reaches 89 against US dollar,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rupee-trading-against-us-dollar-on-december-19-2025/articleshow/126068984.cms,"Rupee continued its upward rally against the US dollar on Friday, strengthening past its 90 mark to reach 89.96 against US dollar in early trade. The currency opened at 90.1325 per dollar, up about 0.1% from its previous close of 90.20 against US dollar. This comes after Rupee made a tentative recovery after sliding to record lows earlier this week, even depreciating to the 91 level against US dollar.This rebound was largely attributed to intervention by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which stepped in to sell dollars after the currency came under intense and sustained pressure. Bankers said the apex bank's intervention was aimed at disrupting the one-way depreciation that had built up in the market, triggering unwinding of bearish positions.Market participants noted that the RBI’s latest move was similar to its approach in October and November. Back then, it had intervened multiple times to counter persistent weakness in the currency, selling dollars heavily in both the spot and non-deliverable forward (NDF) markets.Meanwhile, State Bank of India (SBI) has also projected a strong rebound in rupee in the latter half of the next financial year, expecting the recovery to take shape between October 2026 and March 2027, according to its latest report.The country’s largest lender said that its outlook is based on historical currency trends and internal analysis, which suggest that the current phase of weakness is not structural. The report noted that rupee has undergone multiple cycles of depreciation and appreciation in the past and is likely to move out of the present downtrend in the second half of the next fiscal year.","Rupee continued its upward rally against the US dollar on Friday, strengthening past its 90 mark to reach 89.96 against US dollar in early trade.
