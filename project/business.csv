India plans to crank up Tejas production to stem IAF’s depletion in fighters,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-plans-to-crank-up-tejas-production-to-stem-iafs-depletion-in-fighters/articleshow/117967197.cms,"NEW DELHI: With US major General Electric promising the revised delivery of aero-engines for Tejas jets from March onwards, India plans to progressively crank up production of the much-delayed indigenous light combat aircraft and stem the rapid depletion of fighter squadrons in IAF.Tejas-manufacturer Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) already has three Tejas Mark-1A “ready in the flight line”, which will be fitted with the GE-F404 turbofan jet engines once they begin arriving in March. “HAL will have five Tejas Mark-1A jets and four trainers ready by March-April. If the GE engines begin coming, fitments can be done in a few days,” a top defence official told TOI.While integration of advanced electronic warfare systems and the Israeli radars on the Tejas Mark-1A has been completed, work is underway to soon also test-fire the indigenous Astra air-to-air missile from the single-engine jet, which undertook its first flight in March last year.The delivery of 99 GE-404 engines, which HAL contracted for Rs 5,375 crore in Aug 2021 but has been delayed by almost two years, is all-important. GE has now promised to begin the delivery next month, with 12 engines to be delivered in 2026, and 20 every year thereafter, another official said.Depending on the supply of engines, HAL contends it can progressively scale up production to 20 Tejas per year, and then to 24 per year, with the third production line now functional in Nashik to add to the two existing ones at Bengaluru.“The first Tejas Mark-1A should roll out of the Nashik line in a month or two. HAL is also sub-contracting private companies to build wings, fuselages and the like. If they deliver, Tejas production can even go up to 30 per year,” he said.The wait, however, has been excruciating for IAF. Air Chief Marshal A P Singh just last month publicly expressed frustration at the huge delays in the 4th-generation Tejas fighters, while China recently displayed two new 6th-generation fighters.IAF till now has got only 38 of the first 40 Tejas Mark-1 fighters ordered for Rs 8,802 crore under two contracts inked in 2006 and 2010. The first “improved” Tejas Mark-1A jet, out of the 83 contracted from HAL under the Rs 46,898 crore deal in Feb 2021, will now hopefully be delivered in a couple of months. The order for another 97 Tejas Mark-1A fighters for Rs 67,000 crore is also in the pipeline.These 220 jets, along with 108 Tejas Mark-2 variants with more powerful engines, are critical for IAF, down to just 30 fighter squadrons when it is authorized 42.5 to tackle the twin challenge from China and Pakistan.HAL and GE, of course, are now conducting the final techno-commercial negotiations for co-production of the GE-F414 engines in India, with 80% of transfer of technology for around $1.5 billion.These engines, in the 98 Kilonewton thrust class, will power Tejas Mark-2 fighters for a longer combat range and greater capacity to carry weapons than the existing fighters.In Aug 2022, the cabinet committee on security had cleared the development of Tejas Mark-2 with prototypes, flight testing and certification for over Rs 9,000 crore.While the long-delayed Tejas Mark-1 (13.5 tonne weight) was meant to replace obsolete MiG-21s, the Mark-2 variant (17.5 tonne) will succeed fighters like the Mirage-2000s, Jaguars and MiG-29s in IAF’s combat fleet.",General Electric has promised the revised delivery of aero-engines for Tejas jets from March onwards. India plans to progressively crank up production of the much-delayed indigenous light combat aircraft and stem the rapid depletion of fighter squadrons in IAF.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117967178,imgsize-1214326,width-400,resizemode-4/117967178.jpg"

We will finally get permanent homes and a stable means of livelihood,"" he said.Solanki said that people from our community were so excited that they queued up outside the polling booth in Majnu Ka Tilla - a resettlement colony for the refugees.""I have lived here for 17 years but today, for the first time, I truly feel like I am part of Hindustan. Now I have hope that my children will get a better life,"" Chandrama said.For decades, thousands of Pakistani Hindus have sought refuge in India, fleeing religious persecution. Many settled in Delhi's Majnu Ka Tila, living in makeshift shelters, and taking up daily wage work. Yashoda, 27, was the first to receive Indian citizenship in her group.

Delhi assembly polls: Freebies not enough to sway middle class?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-assembly-polls-freebies-not-enough-to-sway-middle-class/articleshow/117965708.cms,"NEW DELHI: Delhi's ever-expanding middle class, instrumental in catapulting Arvind Kejriwal and his AAP party to power after Anna Hazare's anti-corruption movement, forms the epicentre of a political tug-of-war that could give new shape to the city's political future. On Feb 8, when the votes are counted, it will become clear whether the middle class has distanced itself from Kejriwal or reaffirmed its support once again.The strategic importance of this voter segment was evident in both BJP and AAP making big overtures - from the central govt giving income tax benefits in the 2025 Union budget to AAP's distinct middle-class manifesto with a slew of measures for this section. While many middle-class residents appreciate AAP's contributions to education (via govt schools) and healthcare (through mohalla clinics) as well as its efforts to aid the underprivileged with free services, they also feel betrayed by unfulfilled promises, especially in delivering clean and efficient governance.""The middle class initially backed the Anna Hazare movement and then Kejriwal for his anti-corruption stance. We sought good governance, clean surroundings, decent roads and development, but witnessed nothing substantial,"" remarked Rakesh Kumar in Trilokpuri. ""What unfolded were scandals and ministers facing jail time. Free utilities might appeal to those living hand to mouth, but not to us.""Businessman Devendra Tyagi of Chhatarpur similarly lamented the decline in civic infrastructure. ""Development in our area occurred about 15 years ago under a proactive MLA. Now, the roads are deteriorating. Nothing new has been added. And the tug of war between Delhi and central govts only hurts the city.""Air quality is also a cause for distress for households. Orthopaedic Dr Rakesh, 56, of Dwarka was in a dilemma. ""There were only four voters in the queue before me and I still hadn't decided who to vote for,"" he said. ""Important issues like pollution, which affects my family directly, remain unaddressed by candidates. My son jokingly intends to vote for a candidate with a green chilli symbol.""Mahesh and Renuka Wanjare, residents of Kiran Garden, said no one addressed middle-class concerns. ""As an IT professional commuting to Noida, I face traffic problems. My wife, a homemaker, has her concerns about water supply,"" explained Mahesh. ""While the subsidies go to the poor, we struggle with high bills and living expenses, trapped in a cycle that politicians ignore."" Faizal, 42, an engineer, too talked of economic challenges. ""Inflation has made survival tough,"" he said.Raj Kumari, 60, voted in the hope that the incoming govt will create jobs for the young people. Harshvardhan Siddhartha, a dual degree holder seeking govt employment, too said, ""We need jobs to prevent skilled youth from suffering."" Vineet said in Seelampur that limited job opportunities weighed heavily on the community as did sanitation and roads.A group in C block in Krishna Nagar comprising Kuldeep Rai, 52, his wife Renu, 47, cousin Pavan Gupta, 48, Gupta's wife Dimple, 46, and their daughter Pratiksha, 24, had different electoral motivations. The women attributed their business downturn to BJP's policies, while the men held AAP accountable for the same. Nevertheless, they were equally dismayed by all parties shifting their focus to sops and freebies rather than paying attention to fundamental issues during campaigning.Sheerin Khaneja, an international NGO worker, considered intermittent water supply and broken roads while voting.","Delhi's ever-expanding middle class was instrumental in catapulting Arvind Kejriwal and his AAP party to power after Anna Hazare's anti-corruption movement.

Return to bleak future

A family sat in mourning in Tahli village of Punjab's Hoshiarpur. Not for a life lost, but for a dream that died too soon. Kuljinder Kaur's voice quivered as she spoke of her husband Harwinder Singh, who was deported from US after risking everything to build a better life.""We paid Rs 42 lakh to an agent who promised safe passage,"" she said Wednesday, wiping away tears. ""We took the amount on loan, believing he would earn enough to repay it."" Harwinder is back, and the debt remained - a mountain impossible to scale. Villagers gathered around Kuljinder, offering comfort.Harwinder was not alone. Across Punjab's villages, families woke up to harsh reality of human trafficking networks operating in plain sight.In Darapur village, Prempal Singh Saini was reeling from the news that his son Sukhpal has been deported. Sukhpal, a hotel management graduate, had legally moved to Italy last year. But unknown to his family, he had attempted to reach US, only to be sent back.""I had no idea he was even on his way to the US,"" Prempal said. ""He must have thought he could earn more there. Now, he's back to nothing.""From Kapurthala to Hoshiarpur, eight families confronted similar fates. One of them, Lovepreet, a young mother, was deported with her 10-year-old son Prabhjot.The fallout from these deportations is more than just emotional - it is financial ruin. In Fatehgarh Sahib, Jeet Singh spoke of his son Jaswinder, who borrowed Rs 50 lakh to reach US. ""Now, with his return, we face nothing but debt,"" he said. ""We had sold land, borrowed from friends. How will we ever repay?""In Patiala, Ranjit Singh had similar hopes for his 18-year-old son Amrit. The family had five acres of land and a dream of a prosperous future. Now, after spending lakhs on a failed migration, Ranjit said: ""We will never think of sending him abroad again.""At Amritsar airport, the scene was a painful mix of relief and heartbreak. Swaran Singh stood among dozens of anxious relatives, waiting for his son Akashdeep, who had been deported. Akashdeep had first left for Dubai, where he worked as a truck driver. But, longing for a better future, he contacted an agent who promised him passage to US - for a staggering Rs 55 lakh. Singh sold almost all of his 2.5 acre to fund the journey.""My son never returned home from Dubai. He went to US,"" he said. ""Now, he's back, but we are left with nothing.""Nearby, a family waited for their daughter, who had attempted the same perilous journey. Her uncle, speaking on condition of anonymity, shared their story. ""She left for Spain in Jan, then moved to Mexico before trying to enter US. It was all arranged by the man she was to marry.""The groom's family had paid for her migration, expecting her to start a new life in America. ""But instead, she was sent back,"" the uncle rued.The heartbreak stretches beyond Punjab. In Gujarat, the dream of America has crumbled for the deportees, including Ketul Patel, a 40-year-old diamond worker from Patan.Five months ago, Ketul sold his house and borrowed Rs 50 lakh to take his family - his wife and two children - on a journey across borders. They arrived in US believing they had left their struggles behind. But US authorities had other plans.Back home, Ketul's mother Hiraba Patel struggled to accept the truth. ""We had already sold our farmland to buy a house in Surat,"" she said. ""Now, they have nothing left. What will they do?""In Mehsana, a Patel family awaits return of their son and his wife, who left in 2018. They believed their son's birth in US would ensure their safety. Instead, all three, husband, wife, and their American-born child, are being sent back. ""They took a Rs 75 lakh loan to get there,"" a relative said. ""They paid back some, but they still owe Rs 40 lakh. Now, they are broken, and keep talking about ending their lives.""(Inputs from IP Singh in Jalandhar, Bharat Khanna in Patiala, Vibhor Mohan & Yudhvir Rana in Amritsar, Ashish Chauhan in Ahmedabad)","Families across Punjab wake up to harsh reality of human trafficking networks. Hopes sold, lives in debt as deportees are sent back to bleak future.

NEW DELHI: Delhi on Wednesday votes for the assembly elections, with more than 1.5 crore eligible voters hitting the poll button to decide the national capital's politcal fate.A total of 699 candidates: 603 men, 95 women, and one third-gender candidate, are contesting for 70 assembly seats, after 2 weeks of intense campaigning.The polling booths opened at 7 am and voting will continue till 6 pm across 13,766 polling stations spread over 2,696 locations.This high stake contest will witness the ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) striving to retain its power in the region that it has dominated for the last two terms, against its rivals, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Congress.Congress is also looking to achieve a strong comeback after a decade long exile from the capital.Many constituencies are set for fierce battles this time. AAP chief and former CM Arvind Kejriwal faces a tough challenge from BJP's Parvesh Verma and Congress's Sandeep Dikshit, both of whom are former MPs from different constituencies.Meanwhile, CM Atishi is up against BJP’s Ramesh Bidhuri, also a former MP, alongside Congress’s Alka Lamba.Aam Aadmi Party has pledged to expand its welfare schemes, offering free electricity and water, free bus travel for women, and improved education and healthcare, which it claims would save families around Rs 25,000 a month. It has also promised a monthly honorarium of Rs 2,100 for eligible women, free medical treatment for senior citizens, and free bus travel for students.BJP, hoping to break its 30-year drought in Delhi assembly elections, has vowed to continue existing welfare schemes while introducing new ones, including a Rs 2,500 monthly stipend for women, increased pensions for senior citizens, Ayushman Bharat benefits, a monthly pension for small traders, paid internships for youth, and gas cylinders at Rs 500 for low-income households.Congress is attempting to reclaim a share of its traditional voter base from AAP and has promised Rs 8,500 per month for unemployed youth for a year, Rs 2,500 per month for women under the 'Pyari Didi Yojana,' an annual insurance cover of Rs 25 lakh, and zero electricity bills for consumers using up to 300 units.The Delhi election office has pledged to ensure a “free and fair” poll in the city. Delhi’s chief electoral officer R Alice Vaz informed that 1.1 civil officials- polling teams, counting staff, flying squad, sector magistrates, expenditure monitors, control room officials, micro observers and volunteers, along with a pool of 60,000 security personnel have been deployed to achieve the purpose.Approximately 82.7 lakh men and 72.4 women will be casting their vote on Wednesday for whom 21,584 ballot units, more than 20,000 control units and 18,943 VVPAT machines have been set up.Vas further added that all the voters standing in the queue at 6 pm would be allowed to cast their vote.Exit polls are surveys conducted immediately after voters leave polling stations. They aim to predict the outcome of the elections before the official results are declared.However, the election commission has banned releasing exit polls till 6:30 pm on Wednesday, the day of voting. The ban applies to the Delhi elections and bypolls in Uttar Pradesh’s Milkipur constituency and Tamil Nadu’s Erode (East) seat. Citing Section 126A(1) of the R P Act, 1951, the notification stated, “The period between 7am and 6:30pm on 05.02.2025 (Wednesday) is hereby notified as the duration during which conducting, publishing, or publicising exit polls by any means, including print or electronic media, shall be prohibited.”According to the election commission, the exit poll results would be released after 6.30 pm on February 5.The exit poll predictions of 2025 Delhi assembly elections will be live streamed on different news channels, social media platforms, and YouTube channels.The result of the Delhi assembly elections would be announced on Satuday, 8th February.","Polling booths opened at 7 am and voting will continue till 6 pm across 13,766 polling stations spread over 2,696 locations.

Latest income tax slabs 2025-26: How much tax do individuals earning slightly above Rs 12 lakh have to pay? Marginal relief calculations explained,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/latest-income-tax-slabs-2025-26-how-much-tax-do-individuals-earning-slightly-above-rs-12-lakh-have-to-pay-marginal-relief-calculations-explained/articleshow/117911656.cms,"Budget 2025 income tax: The total income till which marginal relief is available is near about Rs. 12,75,000/-.

According to the Income Tax Department, in the new tax regime under section 115BAC(1A), marginal relief is available to resident individuals who have taxable income marginally above Rs 12 lakh. The total income till which marginal relief is available is near about Rs 12,75,000/-.

Latest income tax slabs 2025-26: How is the marginal relief computed?

First the tax as per slab rate is computed on the total income. For e.g. tax on the total income of Rs. 12,10,000/-shall be computed in following steps:

Tax payable on total income of Rs. 12,00,000/- on which rebate is available is Nil.

Now, the tax liability without marginal relief (in this case Rs. 61,500) shall be compared with the amount exceeding total income up to which rebate is available [in this case Rs 10,000, [i.e. Rs.12,10,000- Rs. 12,00,000]

The marginal relief shall be computed by deducting the income exceeding Rs 12, 10,000 (i.e. Rs.10,000) from total tax liability determined in this case (i.e. Rs. 61,500).

Therefore, in this case rebate by way of marginal relief is Rs 51,500 (61,500/- 10,000/-= 51,500/-) is allowed.

Tax payable is therefore Rs 10,000 [Rs 61,500-Rs 51,500]

For income of Rs 12,50,000, the tax liability reduces from Rs 67,500 to Rs 50,000 with marginal relief.

At Rs 12,70,000 income level, the tax obligation decreases marginally from Rs 70,500 to Rs 70,000 with the relief provision.

At Rs 12,75,000 income, the tax payable is Rs 71,250, and marginal relief becomes inapplicable.

Latest income tax slabs 2025-26 post Budget 2025: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced ZERO or NIL tax liability for individuals earning up to Rs 12 lakh in the Union Budget 2025 under the new income tax regime. For salaried individuals, including the standard deduction, this limit is Rs 12.75 lakh under the new regime.But what about individuals with taxable income slightly above Rs 12 lakh? Will they have to pay more income tax than their additional earnings above Rs 12 lakh? Will someone earning Rs 12,10,000 face a Rs 61,500 tax burden versus an individual earning Rs 10,000 less who will pay nothing?There's good news! Here's where the concept of marginal relief comes us. Individuals with income slightly above Rs 12 lakh, which is the nil tax threshold, will receive fair treatment through marginal tax relief.For example, for a person having income of Rs 12, 10,000/-, in the absence of marginal relief, the tax works out to be Rs 61,500/- (5% of Rs 4 lakh + 10% of 4 lakh and 15% of Rs 10,000). However, due to marginal relief, the amount of tax to be actually paid is Rs 10,000/-)Also Read | Income Tax slabs 2025-26: How you can pay ZERO tax with Rs 13.7 lakh salary under new income tax regime The marginal relief is computed in the following manner:-Marginal relief examples:It's important to note that rebate is offered to individuals with taxable income up to Rs 12 lakh under the new tax regime.

Deportation after Modi-Trump conversation on immigration



400% surge in deportations from US



NEW DELHI: The US military plane carrying 104 illegal Indian immigrants landed in Amritsar on Wednesday afternoon, marking the Donald Trump- administration's first crackdown on the country's migrants after assuming office. The official confirmation on the number of deportees are still awaited.A total of 30 deportees aboard the flight were residents of Punjab. Further, 33 deportees are each are from Haryana and Gujarat, three each from Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, and two from Chandigarh, PTI reporting citing sources. Earlier, there were reports of 205 illegal Indian immigrants being deported.The flight landed at Sri Guru Ram Dass Jee International Airport amidst tight security from Punjab Police at 1.55pm.Amritsar airport director, deputy commissioner, commissioner of police, and CIF director had held a meeting and the police barricaded the cargo gate and another entry point at the airport as a part of the security measure.An official on Tuesday had confirmed that a C-17 aircraft carrying migrants had departed for India.This comes ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's two-day visit to the States, where he is also scheduled to meet Trump and hold talks with him.PM Modi and Trump had recently held a conversation where they discussed immigration among other matters of global peace and security.""Discussed immigration with Modi. India will do what is right when it comes to taking back illegal immigrants,"" Trump had said of the conversation.India had assured the US of cooperating in tackling illegal immigration by taking back the migrants who had entered America unlawfully.""We are against illegal immigration, especially because it is linked to several forms of organised crime,"" MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal had said last month.""For Indians not just in the United States, but anywhere in the world, if they are Indian nationals and they are overstaying, or they are in a particular country without proper documentation, we will take them back, provided documents are shared with us so that we can verify their nationality and that they are indeed Indians. If that happens to be the case, we will take things forward and facilitate their return to India,"" he added.The deportation of Indian nationals from the United States surged by 400% in the past three years, according to the US immigration and customs enforcement (ICE) fiscal year 2024 annual report, released in December last year.The report revealed that in 2024, a total of 1,529 Indians were deported, a significant jump from 292 in 2021. In 2024 alone, one Indian was deported every six hours as part of the US government's intensified immigration enforcement efforts.Bloomberg reported last month, citing sources, that both countries have identified around 18,000 illegal Indian migrants for deportation. However, the actual number could be much higher, as the total remains uncertain.India contributes a small portion of illegal migration to the US, with its citizens accounting for approximately 3% of all unlawful crossings in fiscal 2024, according to US customs and border protection data.","The flight landed at Sri Guru Ram Dass Jee International Airport amidst tight security from Punjab Police at 1.55pm.

: After two consecutive terms, there may be signs of voter fatigue with AAP's governance. Criticisms regarding unfulfilled promises and governance challenges could lead some voters to seek change. Corruption allegations: Allegations of corruption against AAP leaders have surfaced frequently in recent months, potentially swaying undecided voters towards the BJP as they position themselves as a cleaner alternative.

Exit polls for the 2025 Delhi assembly elections on Wednesday predicted that the BJP will likely pull off a major upset and secure a majority in the legislative assembly. Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) will likely not get another term, predicted pollsters.The majority mark in the 70-seat Delhi assembly is 36 seats.The results of the elections will be declared on February 8.By 5pm, voter turnout was reported at 57.8% across Delhi's 70 constituencies, with expectations that the final turnout could be higher than the current figures, although it is anticipated to be lower than the 63% recorded in the previous assembly elections in 2020.High-profile campaigning by leaders from all major parties aimed to energise voters and encourage participation.The BJP organised numerous rallies and roadshows featuring prominent leaders, while AAP focused on its record of governance to appeal to its base.The Election Commission of India reported that polling took place across 13,766 stations, with nearly 699 candidates contesting for the assembly seats.The turnout is crucial as it can influence the final results; higher engagement often favors incumbent parties, while lower turnout can benefit opposition parties looking to capitalize on dissatisfaction.Since the emergence of AAP in 2013, exit polls have often struggled to accurately predict its performance.In past elections, pollsters underestimated AAP's strength significantly.For instance, in the 2020 elections, exit polls projected AAP to win around 54 seats, while it ultimately secured 62. Similarly, in 2015, predictions underestimated AAP's landslide victory when it won 67 out of 70 seats.The exit poll results for the 2025 Delhi Assembly elections suggest a potentially transformative moment for Delhi's political landscape. If the BJP's predictions hold true, it would signify not only a return to power but also an end to AAP's dominance in the capital after a decade-long tenure.As counting day approaches on February 8, all eyes will be on how accurately these exit polls predict actual outcomes and what this means for future electoral contests.Several factors may have contributed to the predicted outcomes reflected in the exit polls:","BJP has built a formidable grassroots network that enabled effective voter outreach and mobilization.

Lifetime Pass (₹30,000) – Long-Term Savings Annual Pass (₹3,000) – More Flexible

NEW DELHI: In yet another relief to the middle class and private car owners who frequently use national highways , govt is likely to soon offer the option of purchasing an ‘ annual toll pass ’ with a one-time payment of Rs 3,000 for unlimited use. It will also offer car owners the option to purchase a ‘lifetime pass’ for 15 years with an upfront payment of Rs 30,000.Sources said the proposal is at an advanced stage with the road transport ministry . TOI has also learnt that the ministry is looking at the option of tweaking the base toll rate per km for private cars to give relief to highway users. No new pass has to be bought as they will be embedded in FASTags.At present, only monthly passes are issued to local and frequent commuters for crossing a single toll plaza. For such passes, they need to provide the address proof and other details. This pass is priced at Rs 340 per month, that works out to Rs 4,080 for a year. “So, the offer of Rs 3,000 for unlimited travel across NH network for the entire year is much less than what people pay for free travel at one plaza. This would be optional and detailed analysis has shown that this can be a preferred choice,” said a source.Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari had recently said that his ministry is working on the plan to offer passes for car owners. Sources said the ministry is looking at it as one solution to several issues, including the growing resentment against toll plazas within municipal limits, toll gates at less than 60 km interval and violence at plazas.Data show that out of the total toll revenue of Rs 55,000 crore of 2023-24, private cars had a share of barely Rs 8,000 crore. The trend of toll transaction and collection also shows that while 53% of the transactions were for private cars, their share in toll collection is barely 21%. Moreover, while nearly 60% of traffic are private vehicles at toll plazas between 6 am to 10 pm, the distribution of commercial vehicles are almost even throughout day and night.Sources said there will be no loss of earning due to the passes over a period of few years, though initially the NHAI has to forgo some revenue.","The proposal is at an advanced stage with the road transport ministry.

NEW DELHI: The fate of three major political players and 699 candidates is now sealed with over 60.42% (data updated at 11.30pm) of the 1.56 crore voters of Delhi coming out to cast their votes on Wednesday for electing their representatives for the 70-member assembly in the capital.The voter turnout this year is the lowest since 2008, when only 57.8% of the total number of electors had cast their votes. Nearly 66% of the total electorate exercised their franchise in 2013 while in the subsequent election in 2015, a record high voting of 67.5% was witnessed.The 2020 polls, however, saw a dip of nearly five percentage points with 62.8% exercising their franchise.The turnout this time is 1.8 percentage points more than that of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections – 58.6% – conducted during the peak of summer in May.The Election Commission has, however, said the turnout figures are provisional and will be updated in the next couple of days.ECI director Anuj Chandak said in press statement that near the close of polling, officials have to prepare several statutory and non-statutory forms, seal the EVMs, give copies of VTR (voter turnout) data in Form 17C to the polling agents and then move the EVMs to the designated centres under security.""Thereafter, updated VTR starts continuously reflecting on the VTR APP again from 7pm, as and when the data is updated by ROs (returning officers) when these polling parties return from the polling stations,"" he added.Chandak explained that at times some polling parties fail to submit their documents on poll day which may lead to further update of the turnout numbers after scrutiny of statutory papers and consideration of a repoll, if any.The relatively poor turnout went against the general perception that the city's aware electorate sets an example for the rest of the country. A senior Delhi election official accepted that the turnout was indeed less than expected but added that one should wait for the final turnout figures before looking for reasons. Accepting that the voter turnout was less than what they had expected, election officials said it was too early to look for reasons.""There are several factors that determine voter turnout, and on most occasions those are political. Let's wait for the final numbers before making a comment on it,"" Singh said. It was a triangular contest with AAP, BJP and Congress running an intense campaign in the run-up to the polls.Seeking a third consecutive term, AAP showcased the work done in health, education, water and other sectors besides providing free power and water to frugal consumers and free ride to women in public transport. It promised more welfare schemes for women, senior citizens and other sections of society.BJP, which has been out of office for nearly 26 years, promised to continue the welfare schemes already being run in the capital and also proposed several new free initiatives for various sections of society. With its govt at the Centre, it promised better development projects with a double-engine govt.Congress, while reminding people of the developmental work done by the Sheila Dikshit-led govt in 1998-2013 came out with a manifesto which mentioned various free schemes and plans for all sections.Going by the interim data, Muslim-dominated Mustafabad recorded the highest turnout at 69%, which was more than what was recorded in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls when 66.8% people had cast their votes. However, the constituency recorded a turnout nearly 1.8% less than the 2020 assembly polls, which had witnessed 70.8% voting.Seelampur recorded the second-highest turnout of 68.7%, followed by the reserved constituency of Seemapuri where 65.3% votes were cast. Mehrauli witnessed the lowest turnout of 53% followed by Model Town at 53.4%. The polling started at 7am and the first two hours witnessed a decent turnout of 8.1%. By 11am, almost 20% voting had occurred. That increased to 33.3% at 1pm and 46.5% at 3pm. As per the ECI's voter turnout mobile app, 57.7% turnout was recorded by 5pm with one more hour to go.While the polling booths were largely empty during the first two hours of the day when the air was nippy, officials said queues had started forming by 9am. Several polling booths, especially in the outer Delhi areas, saw queues in the evening, indicating that the final voting percentage may increase by a few more points.""Those who reached the polling stations before the official time of voting to end were given a paper slip.All such voters were allowed to vote,"" said an official.Among the prominent candidates who contested the polls were chief minister Atishi; AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal; former deputy CM Manish Sisodia; ministers Saurabh Bharadwaj, Imran Hussain, Mukesh Ahlawat and Raghuvinder Shokeen; BJP's Vijender Gupta; former MPs Ramesh Bidhuri and Parvesh Verma; former ministers Kailash Gahlot, Raaj Kumar Anand, Arvinder Singh Lovely and Rajkumar Chauhan; Delhi Congress chief Devender Yadav; Sandeep Dikshit; and Haroon Yusuf.The votes will be counted on Feb 8, and if a political party gets a clear majority, the govt will be formed by Feb 11.Election Commission officials claimed that voting remained peaceful across the city and no cases of violence were reported from anywhere.""All 70 assembly constituencies of the National Capital Territory of Delhi went to polls today in a peaceful and festive atmosphere. Voters were delighted with the seamless polling process and facilities at the polling stations,"" Chandak said.""Chief election commissioner Rajiv Kumar, along with election commissioners Gyanesh Kumar and Sukhbir Singh Sandhu, maintained a thorough and exhaustive oversight of the ongoing elections ahead of and during the polling day to ensure seamless, smooth and peaceful elections,"" he added.","The voter turnout this year is the lowest since 2008, when only 57.8% of the total number of electors had cast their votes.

The review was in continuation of the meeting chaired by Shah on Tuesday, in which the Chief of Army Staff, General Upendra Dwivedi, was present, among others.The back-to-back meetings by Shah came close on the heels of a terror attack in south Kashmir's Kulgam district, which had killed ex-serviceman Manzoor Ahmad Wagay, apart from injuring his wife and another relative.Stating that the Narendra Modi govt is committed to completely wiping out terrorism from J&K, Shah said the sustained and coordinated efforts in this direction over the past 10 years have significantly weakened the terrorism ecosystem. He exhorted the security agencies to stay focused on taking stringent action against infiltrators and terrorists, including those engaged in terror financing . ""Our goal should be to uproot the existence of terrorists,"" Shah told the meeting.The home minister directed the agencies to make new appointments in the posts of Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) in view of the timely implementation of the new criminal laws.Recalling the Modi govt's 'policy of zero tolerance against terrorism' to achieve the goal of a terrorism-free Jammu & Kashmir, Shah directed all security agencies to remain vigilant and continue to work in synergy to eliminate terrorism from the UT.""The Union home minister appreciated the efforts of the security agencies for significant improvement in all parameters of the security scenario in J&K,"" said a release issued by the home ministry after Wednesday's review.","Home minister Amit Shah flagged the role of narcotics proceeds in funding terror and facilitating infiltrators.

Although no official data was put out, the state-wise break-up based on multiple reports is: Haryana 35, Gujarat 33, Punjab 31, three from UP and 2 from Maharashtra.On speculation about the deportees being handcuffed, a Punjab govt official said, ""Some of them said barring the kids, they were made to wear handcuffs during the flight. I can't confirm it, though."" The military aircraft, which took off from San Antonio in Texas arrived in Amritsar at 1.55pm and returned around 5.15pm.Several of the deportees told a government official at the airport that they were picked up ""at the US-Mexico border about 10 days ago"". Some said they travelled to the US from the UK.Sources involved in the clearance process at the airport said deportees from Punjab and Haryana were sent home by road. Those from Gujarat and other states were scheduled to take flights late Wednesday. A senior police officer said investigators would look into who helped the deportees reach the US and how much money they paid to these illegal immigration agents.""They feel betrayed by whomever they gave money to. A Gujarati family claims to have paid Rs 1 crore to reach the US,"" another official said. An uncle of a youth from a border village of Amritsar said the family sold one-and-a-half acres of land and spent a little over Rs 42 lakh to send his nephew abroad. ""He reached the US via Mexico only a few months ago,"" he said.Charanjit Singh, a retired police inspector in Punjab, was at the airport to receive his grandson Ajaydeep Singh, a resident of Amritsar Cantt. He said the young man was living in a camp before being deported. On whether families of all the deportees were aware about the circumstances of their return, an official said, ""Some requested us not to inform their families.""Special counters had been set up at the airport to process formalities for the deportees. Several police vehicles and buses were sent to the cargo terminal and used to transport the deportees back to their hometowns.","104 deported Indians landed in Punjab's Amritsar Wednesday afternoon with 104 deported Indians. The Union govt didn't rule out more deportation flights from the US, saying all repatriated citizens whose antecedents had been verified would be ""accepted back"" A Gujarati family claims to have 'paid Rs 1cr' to reach US via Mexico.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117963625,imgsize-790890,width-400,resizemode-4/117963625.jpg"
Is India losing the spring in its step?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/is-india-losing-the-spring-in-its-step/articleshow/117963287.cms,"DEHRADUN: As Jan gave way to Feb, India found itself in what meteorologists describe as an ""early spring-like"" phase, the product of prolonged dry weather and unseasonably high temperatures.According to IMD, Jan 2024 was the third-warmest on record, with average mean temperature of 18.9°C, and the fourth-driest since 1901, making it one of the most arid winter months in recent history.Traditionally, March and April fell into the spring season, but as Feb unfolds with temperatures that feel more like April, data collated by global weather-watching agencies suggest that what was once a predictable passage from winter to summer is increasingly being rewritten by the forces of climate change . This trend, experts say, is more than an anomaly - it is indicative of a gradual but fundamental shift in India's climate, one that could soon render the country's traditional spring season obsolete.Professor Anjal Prakash, research director at Bharti Institute of Public Policy at Indian School of Business (Hyderabad) and an IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Cimate Change, a UN body) author, warned of the wider implications of a disappearing spring. ""With shifting climate patterns, it is becoming increasingly evident that the cherished spring season, once a hallmark of renewal and agricultural vitality, is under threat,"" he said.Prakash added that these changes are disrupting traditional weather cycles, shortening spring, and altering its characteristic temperate conditions. ""The impact extends beyond climate-agriculture, biodiversity, and cultural practices deeply rooted in seasonal transitions are at risk. Addressing this requires immediate, coordinated action to mitigate these effects and preserve the rhythm of our seasons,"" he cautioned.IMD's outlook for this month predicts below-normal rainfall across the country, particularly in northern India, while both maximum and minimum temperatures are expected to remain above average. ""We may see an early or even no spring season at all,"" said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president of meteorology and climate change at Skymet. ""Weak Western Disturbances in Dec and Jan led to less snowfall and fewer winter rains. Additionally, humid and warm winds from the southwest and southeast blocked cold northerly winds, pushing minimum temperatures higher than usual.""The Himalayan region has been particularly affected, with historically low snowfall. Mukhtar Ahmed, director of the regional meteorological centre in Srinagar, J&K, said winters are shrinking rapidly. ""There is no snowfall here, and maximum temperatures have been 6-8°C above normal for three weeks. Winters, which traditionally lasted from Oct to March, are now confined to just Dec and Jan,"" he said.European think tank Climate Central has also highlighted a long-term trend - Feb warming rates have risen significantly in recent decades, causing a sudden shift from winter to summer. World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) has already confirmed 2024 as the warmest year on record, with temperatures about 1.55°C above pre-industrial levels. In northern India, winter is giving way to summer abruptly, eliminating the gradual transition of spring.This winter season has seen severe precipitation deficits across the Himalayas. Since Jan 1, Uttarakhand recorded an 86% shortfall, followed by J&K (80%), Himachal Pradesh (73%) and Sikkim (82%). IMD data shows northwest and eastern India - barring eastern Rajasthan - recorded deficient to significantly deficient rainfall, while central India saw a 96% rainfall deficit in Jan.","As Jan gave way to Feb, India found itself in what meteorologists describe as an ""early spring-like"" phase. This is the product of prolonged dry weather and unseasonably high temperatures. Jan 2024 was the third-warmest on record, with average mean temperature of 18.9°C.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117963611,imgsize-1129258,width-400,resizemode-4/117963611.jpg"

Handcuffed and humiliated': Congress

NEW DELHI: The US military plane carrying 104 illegal Indian immigrants landed in Amritsar on Wednesday afternoon, marking the Donald Trump-administration's first crackdown on the country's migrants after assuming office.The deportees from Punjab and Haryana were taken to their respective hometowns in police vehicles after completion of all formalities.After reaching his home town, one of the deported Indian immigrants, Jaspal Singh said, ""We were handcuffed and legs were chained. These were opened at the Amritsar airport.""He recounted that, at first, they were unaware they were being taken to India. ""We thought we were being taken to another camp. Then a police officer told us that we were being taken to India. We were handcuffed and our legs were chained. The handcuffs and chains were taken off at the Amritsar airport,"" he added.He also claimed he was deceived by a travel agent who had promised him legal entry into the US. ""I had asked the agent to send me after getting a proper US visa. But he deceived me,"" he said, adding that the deal with the agent was finalised at Rs 30 lakh.Jaspal claimed that he reached Brazil by air in July last year. He said he was promised that the next leg of journey, to the US, would be by air too. However, he was ""cheated"" by his agent, who forced him to cross the border illegally.After staying for six months in Brazil, he crossed the border to the US, but was arrested by the US Border Patrol. He was kept there in custody for 11 days and then sent back home, said Jaspal.Earlier, Jaspal's cousin Jasbir Singh said, ""We came to know about his deportation through the media on Wednesday morning"".Jaspal said he was shattered with deportation. ""A huge sum was spent. The money was borrowed.""About the deportations, he said, ""These are issues of governments. When we go abroad for work, we have big dreams for a better future for our families. Those have now been shattered.""Earlier in the day, senior Congress leader Pawan Khera questioned Modi government citing images of Indian nationals in handcuffs facing deportation from the USOn the social media platform X, Khera drew parallels to a 2013 incident during the UPA government's tenure, when Indian diplomat Devyani Kobragade faced handcuffing and strip-searching in the US.His X post read, ""Looking at the pictures of Indians getting handcuffed and humiliated while being deported from the US saddens me as an Indian. I remember in December of 2013, an Indian diplomat Devyani Khobragade was handcuffed and strip searched in America. Foreign Secretary Sujatha Singh registered a strong protest with US Ambassador Nancy Powell.""""The UPA govt retaliated sharply. Leaders like Ms Meira Kumar, Sushil Kumar Shinde & Rahul Gandhi refused to meet the US Congressional delegation (George Holding, Pete Olson, David Schweikert, Rob Woodalland Madeleine Bordallo) that was visiting India at that time. Dr Manmohan Singh termed the US action 'deplorable'. Govt of India withdrew several perks given to the US embassy, including imports of food and alcohol at concessional rates by embassy staff. Income Tax department started investigating the American Embassy school John Kerry expressed regrets at the treatment given to Devyani Khobragade. US administration called up foreign secretary Sujatha Singh to convey the regrets of the USA,"" he added.Congress MP Manickam Tagore also took to X and posted a picture which showed handcuffed men walking.

"Trump dinner, 'El-Mo' meeting on cards at PM Modi's US visit on February 13",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/trump-dinner-el-mo-meeting-on-cards-at-pm-modis-us-visit-on-february-13/articleshow/117957411.cms,"The TOI correspondent from Washington

: Prime Minister Narendra Modi will arrive in Washington a week from now to meet a US President consumed with grand geo-political ideas and theater, with little bandwidth for the small stuff and minor details. While mollifying Trump on trade issues by reducing tariffs and buying more US products will be part of the Indian approach, Trump's tectonic shake-out proposals in the middle-east suggest he's ready for bold, even outrageous, geo-political gambles, something that sits uneasily with an Indian establishment that is very cautious and circumspect in this regard.Modi will be only the second foreign leader after Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to meet Trump at the White House after he assumed office for a second term on January 20, a stark reminder of the MAGA-infused President alliance and partnership priorities. Although not a formal treaty ally -- not that he values any alliance -- India is a key piece in Trump's scheme of things. Officials previewing the visit say big ticket announcements on military purchases, energy (including nuclear) supplies, and artificial intelligence collaboration are on the cards in keeping with the new expectations.Visiting Indian PMs typically place great emphasis on engaging the US Congress during such visits, but American lawmakers have been reduced to supine bystanders in the imperial Trump II regime. Instead, the most important interlocutor in Washington DC after the US President is his unelected tech surrogate Elon Musk, who also happens to be a long-time Modi supporter. Sources said an ""El-Mo"" meeting has not been pencilled in yet during the one-day (February 13) visit, but it is very much on the cards given their long engagement going back to 2015, when Modi first visited the Tesla factory in Fremont, California.The schedule for Modi's visit is still being worked out but sources said he is expected to arrive in Washington DC late on February 12 and depart early on February 14, with all of February 13 committed to bilateral meetings at the White House, with a possible dinner to be hosted by the US President. Musk, who is literally camping out at the Old Executive Office Building next door, will almost certainly be present at the meetings or call on Modi at the Willard Hotel on the other side of the White House.Trump will have most of his cabinet nominees confirmed by the time Modi arrives, along with Tulsi Gabbard and Kash Patel, both with strong ties to the Modi dispensation that is expected to spur cooperation in intelligence field. The only missing piece will be a new US ambassador to India, which Trump has been unable to fill given that many fat cat donors and MAGA principals are said to have given New Delhi a pass because of pollution issues.Scuttlebutt in the US capital that Trump daughter Ivanka was interested in the job has no basis, sources said, given that she has three young children. Trump has named Ivanka's father-in-law Charles Kushner as the US ambassador to France and another in-law, Tiffany Trump's father-in-law Massad Boulos, as Middle East advisor.","Modi will be only the second foreign leader after Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to meet Trump at the White House.

NEW DELHI: Learning from the “rutting” (permanent depressions) at several portions of the Mumbai Expressway’s Sohna-Dausa section last year, which attracted huge criticism, the NHAI has directed detailed testing of the stone mastic asphalt (SMA) material used in other highway projects.Deficiency in the quality of SMA used on this section was identified as one the major reasons for the expressway getting damaged less than two years after its inauguration. Several projects, including the Delhi-Amritsar-Katra Expressway , have been constructed or are being constructed using 50 mm SMA — a gap-graded hot mix asphalt that contains a large percentage of coarse aggregate (over 70%) and bitumen filler mastic.This is used since it is strong, durable, and resistant to deformation. The investigation into the Sohna-Dausa stretch had found that the highway builder had used SMA having 13 mm aggregate, while 19 mm aggregate was preferable.The probe also found that rutting mostly developed during the summer when the temperature of the pavement was more than 70 degrees Celsius. An expert panel had observed that the grade of bitumen used could not sustain high temperatures and recommended use of higher-grade bitumen. It recommended the removal of the SMA layers in stretches where the average rut depth was more than 10 mm, and re-lay the stretch with 50 mm SMA, having 19 mm aggregate with higher quality bitumen.Officials said the work has been completed. “Since this incident came to our notice, we are carrying out tests across all other stretches where SMA has been used to detect if there are similar issues,” said an official.In a circular, the NHAI has said “some incidences” have been reported regarding the “deficiency in quality of SMA” on completed projects”. It added that agencies must ensure that technology (SMA) is implemented in a right manner so that it can survive.In case, SMA or DBM, which is often used as a base course for roads, fails in compliance or has a tendency of premature distress or rutting, then more samples from other locations will be sent for testing. Subsequently, the rectification will be carried out in consultation with domain experts.","The NHAI has directed detailed testing of the stone mastic asphalt (SMA) material used in other highway projects.

Family members who are now filled with fear are now unable to sleep at night due to the growing anxiety and action being taken by Trump.Family members say that the children insisted on going, forcing them to send them to the USA by selling land and valuables through the dangerous ""donkey route."" Agents charged over 40 lakhs per person to send the children via this route. Now, if the children are deported, the families will be ruined.Talking to TOI, Suresh Kumar, a retired army personnel and a native of Khark Bhura village in Uchana town of Jind district, is at a loss for words after his son Rohit Sharma (21), was deported in first batch.""My son went to the UK on January 20, 2024, after completing his graduation. He initially went there on a study visa, but later decided to go to America. He reached America a few days ago, but was caught there. I haven’t received any official communication from the authorities; instead, I learned about his return to India after the village sarpanch and local police contacted me to confirm his details. I haven’t been in touch with my son for the past 15 days, and I don’t know what has happened to him. I am unable to do anything at the moment, but I take solace in knowing that he is coming back alive. Once he returns, I will speak to him and advise him to settle his life in India,"" he said.Gurudev Singh, a resident of Jind, shared that his son went to England two years ago, but after insisting, he requested money and somehow made his way to the USA. They spent nearly 50 lakhs to send him. Now, due to Trump's actions, everyone is worried. The whole family can't sleep at night. Everyone is concerned about what will happen next. ""I have only one son, but out of his persistence, I sent him to the US. Now, children being sent back in handcuffs, it is devastating, and the family is worried about how they will recover the money they invested,"" Singh said.Singh explained that unemployment in Haryana is at its peak, and young people can't find jobs. They are hopeless and disheartened. That's why they want to go abroad. ""If the government ensures good employment opportunities and industries create new jobs in India, the youth will not go abroad.

NEW DELHI: Home minister Amit Shah on Wednesday lauded the appointment of over 2800 youths in Tripura government, noting how the Manik Saha regime in state is providing jobs with full transparency and without any discrimination or corruption, unlike the earlier Left govt that only provided employment to communist “party cadres”.Addressing the programme for distribution of over 2800 appointment letters in Tripura govt through video conference, Shah said Saha govt has ensured a new beginning in the lives of 2,807 youths of the state by offering them 2,437 multi-tasking staff positions and 370 health department positions on Wednesday. With their appointment letter, he said, the 2,807 beneficiaries had become part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s campaign for a developed Tripura and India.Highlighting the vision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to keep the entire northeast on the path of development, Shah said thanks to initiatives taken in the region over the past 10 years, the northeast once known for insurgency, infiltration, blockades, drugs, arms smuggling, corruption, and ethnic tensions “is now known for development, connectivity, infrastructure, education, investment, and the growth of agricultural activities”.Mentioning the peace initiatives taken in Tripura – three agreements signed in the last 10 years – the home minister recalled how the lives of Bru-Reang tribes have changed for the better with sops like permanent residency, education, healthcare, and job opportunitiesHe added that all the insurgent groups in Tripura have been eliminated, surrendered or become part of the mainstream. Shah said that Tripura is moving ahead on the path of participation instead of distraction, speed instead of obstruction, and welfare instead of delay.Underlining how development has picked up in the last seven years, Shah said the policies of Modi government have transformed Tripura from a landlocked state to a land-linked state. He said that airport, roads, water harvesting and irrigation have been taken up by the Government of India and Tripura for the all-round development of the state.","Home minister Amit Shah lauded the appointment of over 2800 youths in Tripura government.

We had issued a detailed statement on this issue on Aug 24, 2024,” Congress general secretary and former environment minister Jairam Ramesh said on X.Referring to the glacial lake outburst-linked flash floods that destroyed the Teesta-III project in Oct 2023, Congress had last year alleged that hydel projects in ecologically fragile regions had been coming up over the past few years “without giving adequate thought to their cumulative environmental impacts”.“Dams on the Teesta are the prime, but not the only, example of how - in the name of development - ecology is being fundamentally altered, with grave consequences for this and future generations,” it said. The party had also flagged that a spate of hydro projects on the Teesta had caused the river to become more flood-prone, washing away sections of National Highway-10, the lifeline of Kalimpong in West Bengal and Sikkim.BJP Sikkim president D R Thapa on Feb 2 wrote to Modi, urging him to direct immediate withholding of the green panel’snod for the Teesta-III project until all necessary scientific reviews, including the revised Probable Maximum Flood study, are completed and independently validated.Thapa also urged the PM to order a fresh and comprehensive environmental impact assessment (EIA) to incorporate recent climate data, glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) risks, and the state’s evolving ecological challenges before final decision.The expert panel had on Jan 10 given its conditional nod to certain amendments in the green clearance to resume construction of the 1,200 MW Teesta-III project. Redesigning the dam and replacing the earlier ‘concrete faced rockfill dam’ with a ‘concrete gravity dam’ is one of the amendments.The panel, however, put a condition, saying “all necessary permissions from Central Electricity Authority (CEA)/Central Water Commission (CWC) or any other agency with respect to project design and other safety parameters shall be obtained before starting the project construction work”.","Congress too opposed the approval, claiming the move was a “thoughtless clearance’ The threat of disaster continued to persist at the dam site, Congress said.

The review was in continuation of the meeting chaired by Shah on Tuesday, in which the Chief of Army Staff, General Upendra Dwivedi, was present, among others.The back-to-back meetings by Shah came close on the heels of a terror attack in south Kashmir’s Kulgam district, which had killed ex-serviceman Manzoor Ahmad Wagay, apart from injuring his wife and another relative.Stating that the Narendra Modi government is committed to completely wiping out terrorism from J&K, Shah said the sustained and coordinated efforts in this direction over the past 10 years have significantly weakened the terrorism ecosystem. He exhorted the security agencies to stay focused on taking stringent action against infiltrators and terrorists, including those engaged in terror financing . “Our goal should be to uproot the existence of terrorists,” Shah told the meeting.The home minister directed the agencies to make new appointments in the posts of Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) in view of the timely implementation of the new criminal laws.Recalling the Modi government's ‘policy of zero tolerance against terrorism’ to achieve the goal of a terrorism-free Jammu and Kashmir, Shah directed all security agencies to remain vigilant and continue to work in synergy to eliminate terrorism from the UT.“The Union home minister appreciated the efforts of the security agencies for significant improvement in all parameters of the security scenario in Jammu and Kashmir,” said a release issued by the home ministry after Wednesday’s review.","Home minister Amit Shah flagged the role of narcotics proceeds in funding terror and facilitating infiltrators.

NEW DELHI: Labelling the announcements for financial assistance by political parties as ""mere poll promises"", a section of women in Delhi said they voted for better education and safety. A woman voter in Dilshad Garden said announcing a financial aid was just a poll promise.""We don't need this ... We want those that would improve a common person's life. I have been working as a government schoolteacher on a contract for eight years. I want the government to make my job permanent,"" she said.The BJP, AAP and the Congress have each promised financial assistance for women, a demographic that constitutes 46.2 per cent of Delhi's electorate. The national capital has 72.36 lakh women voters.The saffron party has proposed a monthly financial assistance of Rs 2,500 for all women while the ruling AAP, under the Mahila Samman Yojana, has pledged Rs 2,100 per month. The Congress has promised Rs 2,500 per month to every woman under the Pyari Didi Yojana, similar to initiatives implemented in other states governed by it.Gole Market resident Madhu said, ""Everyone is trying to buy votes. After one party announced a monthly allowance for women, all other parties did the same. Why didn't they do it earlier?""""I voted for development and better opportunities for the future generation, not fake allowances,"" she added.Priya Sharma, a 35-year-old voter in Southeast Delhi, said that, as a woman, she was looking for a government that truly understood and addressed her needs.Okhla resident Ayesha Khan (27) called the election a chance to choose a government that would support women's rights, education, health care, and safety.""We are seeking a government that will prioritise our safety, health and empowerment. This election is our chance to have a say in shaping a better future for women,"" she said.Emphasising that the parties knew women's voices mattered, she said she expected a government that didn't just use women for elections with promises of monthly allowances or free bus rides.Women voters in Delhi's northeast and east said the pre-election promises of monthly allowances were not a matter of concern for them.Shazia, a homemaker in Babarpur, said employment was a major issue.""The election is one of hope. Apart from getting free electricity and water supply, we also want jobs for everyone. Everything is becoming expensive. We hope the party that forms the government will look into this issue,"" she said.Mustafabad resident Gulshan said she wanted the government to fulfil women's basic needs as well as ensuring their security.Rabia Khan, a homemaker in Jafrabad, said she wanted the incoming government to focus on addressing inflation.""We want a government which focuses on inflation and provides us with a better and affordable environment for living.

DELHI: Madhubala, a 29-year-old third gender, cast her vote for the first time and expressed hope for a better future. ""We want policies that empower us, ensure our safety and give us equal opportunities,"" she said.Delhi has a total of 1.55 crore eligible voters, including 1,261 third genders (transgenders) with their highest concentration (294) in South-West Delhi.Some of the community members were enthused about being able to vote for the first time, seeing it as a valuable opportunity to contribute to the democratic process and shape a better future for all.Madhubala, a dancer by profession who teaches Bollywood-style dance to children, said, ""I voted for the first time with the belief that each vote is important.""She said there are many things in the national capital that need to be fixed, right from human rights to basic infrastructure.""Our community needs leaders who will not neglect us and will take us along with others. We do not want to be left behind.""""We want policies that empower us, ensure our safety and give us equal opportunities,"" Madhubala told PTI.Another transgender from North East District, Tina Kinnar , cast her vote and encouraged her community members to exercise their constitutional right.""We have the right to vote and it strengthens democracy. To all my fellow women of the transgender community, voting is your right. You must vote,"" Tina said.While some expressed excitement and positivity, a few said they were disappointed with the ""failure"" of the political parties to adequately address the needs of the community.Sam Williams, a 40-year-old transgender who voted for the first time, expressed frustration with the lack of support from the political parties for the third gender community.""None of the parties support us... It is disheartening. There are so many announcements for male and female voters, but we are not included as if we are not part of them. We need equal acceptance and opportunity,"" she said.Williams described the voting experience as ""powerful"". ""We all are supposed to stand and participate in the game of democracy. Only then can we fight for ourselves and bring the changes we need,"" she added.Malika Kinnar, a transgender from Jangpura, expressed her eagerness to make an impact. ""It feels empowering to be part of the democratic process. We have often been forgotten but now we have an opportunity to prove that we too matter.""She continued, ""Slowly, things are changing. From nothing, we now have the opportunity to cast our votes as third gender.""""It is a huge development for us. Of course, the process is slow but it is just the start. One day, we will not just vote but we will also be respected by the party, with hope for a better and more inclusive future,"" she said.Polling took place at 13,766 stations across all of Delhi's 70 assembly constituencies to decide the fate of 699 candidates in a contest that could reshape the political landscape of the capital.While the AAP is eyeing a third consecutive term, the BJP and Congress are hoping for a resurgence in Delhi.In the 2020 assembly polls, Delhi recorded a voter turnout of 62.59 per cent, while only 56 per cent of voters participated in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.The results for the 70-member Delhi assembly polls will be declared after counting of votes on February 8.","Delhi has a total of 1.55 crore eligible voters, including 1,261 third genders (transgenders) The results for the 70-member Delhi assembly polls will be declared after counting of votes on February 8.

Delhi election voting time: 7am to 6pm- 11 hours that will matter for 5 years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-elections-2025-7am-to-6pm-11-hours-that-will-matter-for-5-years/articleshow/117927947.cms,"Also Read:

NEW DELHI: The stage is set for a gripping three-way contest that will not only shape the future of the capital but also determine the political fate of its three main contenders.More than 1.5 crore eligible voters will have the chance to choose their representatives for the 70-member Delhi assembly from a pool of 699 candidates - 603 men, 95 women and a third-gender person - who have campaigned vigorously over the past two weeks. The polling booths will open at 7am and voting will continue till 6pm.The last two assembly elections were one-sided with AAP winning two huge mandates. BJP could barely manage to mark its presence in the assembly and Congress was almost decimated. In 2015, AAP romped home with 54.6% vote share and a record 67 seats with the remaining three going to BJP. The 2020 assembly elections saw AAP's vote share and seats drop only marginally to 53.6% and 62, respectively. BJP won the remaining eight seats and Congress failed to open its account yet again.The three political parties are engaged in a fierce electoral battle once again and have spared no effort in wooing the electorate. Most of the promises made in their election manifestos have a similar ring.Several seats are going to witness a keen contest this time. While AAP chief and former CM Arvind Kejriwal is facing a stiff challenge from BJP's Parvesh Verma and Congress's Sandeep Dikshit, both former MPs from different constituencies in different years, CM Atishi is pitted against BJP's Ramesh Bidhuri, another former MP, and Congress's Alka Lamba.As the city votes today, several contests would be closely watched, among them former deputy CM Manish Sisodia, who has shifted from Patparganj to Jangpura, where BJP's Tarvinder Singh Marwah and Congress's Farhad Suri are his two main rivals. In Ballimaran, there is a keen contest between Congress heavyweight and former minister Haroon Yusuf and incumbent AAP minister Imran Hussain.Greater Kailash, Malviya Nagar, Gandhi Nagar, Mangolpuri, Patparganj and Matia Mahal are some of the other seats of immense consequence this time.AAP has promised a number of new welfare schemes, which, it claims, will help families make huge savings. It has showcased free electricity and water provided to frugal consumers and free travel for women in public buses as some of its schemes which, along with ""good education and health"", have helped each household make a monthly saving of nearly Rs 25,000. The party has also claimed that a monthly honorarium of Rs 2,100 for eligible women, free treatment for senior citizens and free travel for students in buses will save another Rs 10,000.While promising to continue the schemes run by the AAP-led Delhi govt, BJP - which has not won a single assembly election in Delhi after 1993 - has promised a monthly honorarium of Rs 2,500 to women besides increasing the pension for senior citizens; implementation of the Ayushman Bharat healthcare scheme for senior citizens; a monthly pension for small traders and entrepreneurs; paid internship for the youth; and a gas cylinder at Rs 500 for the poor.For Congress, it is a matter of survival and staying relevant in city politics. Its campaign was aimed at wresting at least a section of its vote bank from AAP. The party has assured Rs 8,500 per month to the unemployed for a year; Rs 2,500 a month for women under 'Pyari Didi Yojana'; an insurance cover of Rs 25 lakh every year; and zero bills for consumers using up to 300 units, if it elected to office.A bitter campaign that ended on Monday saw AAP, BJP and Congress hurl allegations at each other. Regular representations were made by all three parties to EC, accusing each other of violating the model code of conduct. Interestingly, all three parties this time have an exclusive focus on Poorvanchalis, who form almost one-fourth of the total vote share. Not only have the three parties given tickets to several candidates from the region, BJP has even allied with political parties of Bihar - Janata Dal (United) and Loktantrik Janshakti Party (Paswan) - and allocated them one seat each.The Delhi election office, meanwhile, has promised a ""free and fair"" poll in the city. According to chief electoral officer R Alice Vaz, nearly 1.1 lakh civil officials - polling teams, counting staff, flying squad, sector magistrates, expenditure monitors, control room officials, micro observers and volunteers - and 60,000 security personnel have been deployed.There are nearly 82.7 lakh men and 72.4 lakh women eligible to cast their votes on Wednesday at 13,766 polling booths spread across 2,696 locations across the city.Vaz added that 21,584 ballot units, 20,692 control units and 18,943 VVPAT machines have been procured to conduct the polls. ""A paid holiday has been declared for employees working in govt and private sectors as well as for those employed in shops and commercial establishments. This move, aimed at facilitating voter participation, also applies to voters from bordering states, UP and Haryana, who are employed in Delhi,"" Vaz said.While voting will take place till 6pm, Vaz said all voters standing in a queue at 6pm will be allowed to cast their vote. ""ECI has issued clear directives, prohibiting the use of mobile phones, cameras, smartwatches and any other electronic items inside the polling stations,"" Vaz said.The CEO said that all polling stations will be closely monitored by her office and also by the offices of the district election officers through webcasting.","More than 1.5 crore eligible voters will have the chance to choose their representatives for the 70-member Delhi assembly.

'No room for manipulation': What EC said on claims of voter list meddling



'Foolproof': What EC said on EVM tampering allegations



'Why does he want it?' EC over blocking public access of CCTV footage of poll booths



NEW DELHI: Election Commission of India on Tuesday addressed concerns regarding wrongful additions and deletions of voters in the electoral roll and said that the allegations regarding the rigging Electronic Voting Machines were ""baseless.""Setting a poetic tone, the chief election commissioner Rajiv Kumar began with a shayari: ""All questions hold importance; answers must follow; out of habit, we kept giving written replies, but today, face-to-face feels necessary; who knows if tomorrow will come or not, today, an answer is due).""The CEC, before announcing the dates of Delhi assembly elections, took the opportunity to offer clarifications on allegations, including EVM tampering , erratic changes in voter list and recent changes in rules by the poll body to prevent public inspection of certain electronic documents.Kumar refuted claims of manipulation in the electoral roll, categorically mentioning that no deletion is made without proper documentation, field verification, and providing the individual an opportunity to be heard.On addition of names to the electoral roll, Kumar said, ""Regular meetings are held with the representatives of political parties, who have the right to appoint booth-level agents (BLAs). Weekly lists of claims and objections are shared, and both draft and final rolls are published on the Election Commission's website. Polling station rationalisation is also carried out with the consultation of all the stakeholders.""Regarding deletion of names from the list, he said, ""Mandatory field verification is conducted by the BLOs, and in cases where deletions exceed 2 per cent of a polling station's voter list, cross-verification is done. Deletions due to death require a certified death certificate, and a seven-day window is provided for objections after notices are published online. Also, the affected voters are given the opportunity for a personal hearing before their names are removed.""""Where every vote matters, raising doubts about deletion of thousands of names without evidence is misleading. The processes we follow leave no room for manipulation,"" he said.He added that political parties were involved at each and every stage of voter list preparation with full disclosure and opportunity to object.CEC said that it was not possible to change the voter turnout and said that it was ""misleading to compare final VTR with 5pm data.""""...It is impossible to change voter turnout...Some polling parties report at midnight or the next day. Form 17C is matched before counting. There is nothing which VTR does not explain. It explains fully,"" he said.Addressing the EVM issue, CEC said, ""There is no evidence of unreliability or any drawback in the EVM... There is no question of introducing a virus or bug in the EVM. There is no question of invalid votes in the EVM. No rigging is possible. High courts and the Supreme Court are continuously saying this in different judgments... What else can be said? EVMs are foolproof devices for counting. Allegations of tampering are baseless. We are speaking now because we don't speak when elections are on.""Kumar also cited court rulings at multiple occasions and said that ""courts have ruled on 42 occasions that EVMs are not hackable, allegations of tampering totally baseless.""""This is aimed at derailing the electoral process,"" he added.Further, he said that no discrepancies had been found between votes counted through Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) and Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) slips,"" he said.""Let me tell the nation today. After the Supreme Court mandated in 2019 that five VVPATs must be counted from each assembly constituency, over 67,000 VVPATs have been checked. ""This translates to more than 4.5 crore (VVPAT) slips being verified. And let me assure you that not even the difference of one vote has been found with the new machines since 2019,"" he added.Kumar defended the recent amendment to election rules restricting public access to CCTV footage from polling booths, citing the need to safeguard voter privacy and prevent misuse of data to create false narratives.""Why does he want it? Let us ask this question from the person who wants it,"" Kumar asked as he addressed the reason why the poll body had decided to block public access to CCTV footages of poll booths.The CEC explained that the poll authority has evidence showing how such data could be exploited for machine learning and AI to craft deceptive narratives. He cautioned that even fact-checkers might struggle to distinguish between genuine and AI-generated videos of polling stations.The government, acting on the Election Commission's recommendation, amended the rules last month to limit public inspection of certain electronic documents, including polling station CCTV footage, to prevent potential abuse.This comes amidst the opposition raising concerns regarding irregularities in electoral processes, with AAP national convenor Arvind Kejriwal recently accusing BJP of tampering with voters' lists in Delhi. The former CM had alleged that there was an ""unusual increase"" in voter list modifications, including both removals and additions, specifically in New Delhi constituency.Congress had also raised similar concerns during Maharashtra and Haryana assembly elections, with Mallikarjun Kharge demanding ballot papers instead of EVMs.Assembly elections in Delhi are set to take place in a single phase on February 5. Votes would be counted on February 8.","The Election Commission of India addressed concerns regarding wrongful additions and deletions of voters in the electoral roll.

""For Philadelphia, I don't know if an Embiid trade is on the horizon,""

""We just saw Luka get traded. We just saw Anthony Davis get traded. The Sixers have had their own issues this year because Embiid can't stay healthy and isn't on the floor.""

Sixers are weighing their options with Embiid's future in question

How can a Joel Embiid trade benefit the Los Angeles Lakers?

Thehave already made a historic move by acquiring Luka Doncic from the Dallas Mavericks, but the blockbuster moves may not be over yet. Speculation is up in the air that the Philadelphia 76ers could look to take things up a notch with a potential trade sendingto the Lakers once he becomes eligible.According to YouTuber 'SROS,' the Sixers could explore trading Joel Embiid and Guerschon Yabusele to the Los Angeles Lakers in exchange for Austin Reaves, Rui Hachimura, Gabe Vincent, Jarred Vanderbilt, and a 2031 first-round pick. While no concrete talks have been reported, the idea of pairing Embiid with Doncic is generating buzz.SROS stated. Joel Embiid , the reigning MVP, inked a three-year, $192.9 million extension last offseason, but due to NBA rules, he cannot be traded until after September 28. While this means no immediate deal is possible, Philadelphia may revisit the possibility in the offseason if they decide to reshape their roster.The Sixers have struggled with inconsistency this season, and injuries have once again played a role in limiting their success. Moving Embiid would free up significant cap space and allow them to retool for the long term. If the organization believes their championship window is closing, dealing their franchise cornerstone could be a way to reset.For the Los Angeles Lakers, parting with Reaves and other key depth pieces would be a tough decision, but the upside of adding Joel Embiid is undeniable. After losing Anthony Davis in the trade for Doncic, LA is lacking a dominant big man. A healthy Embiid would instantly fill that void and provide LeBron James with a formidable running mate as he chases his fifth NBA title.Beyond LeBron, Embiid could also thrive in a post-James era alongside Doncic, easing his offensive burden while benefiting from the young star's elite playmaking. At 30 years old, Embiid still has several prime years left, making him a valuable piece for any team with championship ambitions.Also read: NBA Trade Rumor: Golden State Warriors go all-in on $194.2 million Suns star to elevate Stephen Curry’s title hopes While this trade remains purely hypothetical for now, it is a scenario worth watching as the offseason approaches.

Examining the possible landing spots for Giannis Antetokounmpo

What are the future plans for Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Milwaukee Bucks?

By sending Khris Middleton to the Washington Wizards in exchange for Kyle Kuzma, thehave already made a big move as the NBA trade deadline draws near. As they aim for another title, the acquisition shows that Milwaukee intends to bolster its roster aroundand Damian Lillard.However, Antetokounmpo’s recent activity on social media has raised a few odd brows. Shortly after the trade, he posted a tweet featuring the colors red and white along with a thinking emoji, only to delete it moments later. The internet was quick to capture screenshots before the post vanished, fueling discussions about whether it hinted at a possible move involving the Milwaukee Bucks superstar.The tweet’s color scheme has led many to connect it to three potential NBA teams—the Chicago Bulls, Miami Heat, and Houston Rockets. All three franchises have been linked to Giannis Antetokounmpo in trade discussions or as possible free-agency destinations in the past.Among the three, Miami seems like a strong contender. The Heat are reportedly looking to part ways with Jimmy Butler , who is on a similar $48 million per year contract as Antetokounmpo. A trade involving both players would make financial sense, giving Milwaukee another star while allowing Miami to land one of the league’s most dominant forwards.Houston is another possibility, but acquiring Giannis Antetokounmpo would require a significant roster shake-up. The Rockets would likely need to part with Fred VanVleet and other key players to match salaries and provide Milwaukee with enough value in return. Future draft capital could also play a role in making a deal more attractive for the Milwaukee Bucks.Chicago, however, appears to be the least likely destination. The Bulls are in the midst of a rebuild and would need to gut their roster to acquire Antetokounmpo. Trading for him would leave the team without the necessary supporting cast, making it a difficult scenario for both parties.While the deleted tweet has lit up trade rumors, it remains uncertain whether it had any real significance. With the deadline here, the Milwaukee Bucks might not be finished making moves. If they follow the trend set by teams like the Dallas Mavericks, another major deal could still be on the horizon.Also read: NBA Trade Rumor: Los Angeles Lakers eye shocking move for $192 million Philadelphia 76ers MVP after blockbuster Luka Doncic deal For now, Antetokounmpo remains in Milwaukee, but his social media activity has certainly given fans food for thought that is going to raise speculations in an already eventful trade season.","Milwaukee Bucks sent Khris Middleton to Washington Wizards in exchange for Kyle Kuzma.

Pete Alonso’s Future Is “Certain” With His Former Team, The New York Mets, According To Andy Martino



Pete Alonso Might Have To Compromise To Sign A Deal With The New York Mets



Pete Alonso is one of the most popular and talented players in MLB who is yet to join a team for the 2025 season of Major League Baseball. While his free agency continues, many fans and experts are hopeful that Pete Alonso would choose to go back to his former team, the New York Mets, even though he previously rejected their three year deal for a whopping $70 million. Recently. SNY’s Andy Martino provided the latest update on the situation between Pete Alonso and the New York Mets and whether there is a possibility of a reunion.As per SNY’s Andy Martino when the New York Mets’ $70 million deal for three years was rejected by the star player, there was an assumption within the team that Pete Alonso might sign with another team. But unfortunately or fortunately, that is not what happened with the star player. While the Mets believed that Pete Alonso would easily get a better deal, he has remained a free agent, even when Spring Training is just a fortnight away. This could prompt the Mets to approach Pete Alonso again since he does not have another team waiting for him.A couple of days ago at the Amazin’ Day Fest, Steve Cohen, the owner of the New York Mets, had expressed being “exhausted” over the negotiation process with Pete Alonso and admitted that negotiating with Juan Soto was much “easier”. Despite this revelation, SNY’s Andy Martino believes that there is a high chance of Pete Alonso going back to the New York Mets.Andy Martino said, “Yes, they made a financial pivot starting on Jan. 16. And yes, these negotiations have been “exhausting.” But it’s hard to see anything that would prevent a warm reunion.”However, he also added that probably both Pete Alonso and the New York Mets have to compromise to reach a balanced deal. Andy Martino said, “If the Mets are willing to stretch their budget (their call), and Alonso is willing to return for much less than what he turned down in 2023 (his call, but the above timeline suggests that he is), why not do it?”Pete Alonso has not confirmed any rumours yet. Many fans have slammed him and his agent, Scott Boras, for not going ahead with the New York Mets three year deal for $70 million, because apparently, it was a “fair deal”.

For an annual income of Rs 13.7 lakh, with basic salary at 50% (Rs 6.85 lakh), the NPS contribution at 14% would amount to Rs 95,900. Combined with the Rs 75,000 standard deduction, this eliminates tax liability on the entire Rs 13.7 lakh.

Latest income tax slabs 2025-26 after Budget 2025: Zero income tax on Rs 13.7 lakh salary? Don’t rub your eyes! Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in her Budget 2025 speech announced that there will be NIL or zero income tax for individuals earning up to Rs 12 lakh. But did you know that for salaried individuals, the tax-free annual income can reach Rs 13.7 lakh, compared to Rs 12 lakh for others!“I am now happy to announce that there will be no income tax payable upto income of Rs 12 lakh (i.e. average income of Rs 1 lakh per month other than special rate income such as capital gains) under the new regime. This limit will be Rs 12.75 lakh for salaried tax payers, due to standard deduction of Rs 75,000,” FM Sitharaman announced in her Union Budget speech.This advantage of no tax till Rs 13.7 lakh income stems from the Rs 75,000 standard deduction and National Pension System (NPS) investments. Section 80CCD(2) allows tax deduction of up to 14% of basic salary invested in NPS, whilst the old tax regime offers 10%.According to an ET analysis, a salaried individual with Rs 13.7 lakh yearly income can achieve tax savings of approximately Rs 96,000 through NPS contributions. It’s important to note that this benefit requires employer participation in NPS as part of cost to the company, as employees cannot opt independently.It’s interesting to note that despite this opportunity existing for nearly a decade, only 2.2 million individuals have enrolled. ""Only a few corporates are interested in rolling out the NPS benefit, and even fewer employees are willing to enrol in it,"" said Sudhir Kaushik, chief executive of tax filing portal Taxspanner.com.Also Read | New vs old income tax regime after Budget 2025: Post income tax slab changes, which tax regime is better for salaried middle class taxpayers? The extended NPS lock-in period and withdrawal limitations at maturity discourage many investors. Pre-retirement withdrawals are restricted to exceptional circumstances. Upon maturity, only 60% can be withdrawn, whilst 40% must be invested in an annuity for lifetime pension.Financial experts consider these restrictions beneficial. ""The lack of liquidity in NPS is not necessarily bad because the money is at the right place. Investment returns can be enormous if held for the long term,"" said Sriram Iyer, chief executive of HDFC Pension.NPS provides additional benefits, including asset mix selection, fund switching options, and pension fund manager changes without tax implications. It maintains the industry's lowest fund management charges at 0.09% annually, compared to 1-1.5% for the most economical mutual funds.

Rohan Khaunte: Will not tolerate Goans subletting shacks to Delhiwallahs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/khaunte-will-not-tolerate-goans-subletting-shacks-to-delhiwallahs/articleshow/117701194.cms,"PANAJI:

Tourism minister Rohan Khaunte has instructed the tourism director to initiate an enforcement drive to regulate the operations of shacks, water sports, adventure activities, and other tourism-related activities. Khaunte said the department will not tolerate Goans subletting their shacks to “Delhiwallahs” and outsiders.“Using technology, we will go to the next level and ensure each shack is monitored. From Mandrem to Calangute to the south, mapping has started,” said Khaunte.He said that shack operation was a traditional business of locals and that it “must remain with Goans”. He said the tourism department simplified the allotment process, agreed to all the demands of the Shack Owners Welfare Society , and issued permissions for shacks well in advance with the “belief that a Goan will not give away his own business” to a “Delhiwallah come here to make money”.The minister said that enforcement drives will be continuous. He also said Goan shack operators finding it unviable to operate the allotted shacks should surrender them so that those on the waiting list get a chance. “These Delhiwallahs come here to make money and these incidents happen. We have been very clear that these businesses cannot be allowed to be taken over by outsiders,” said Khaunte.Speaking about paragliding activities, Khaunte said extreme adventure sports are fraught with risks, which tourists and enthusiasts need to understand and accept. “Adventure activities come under extreme sports and such extreme sports will always have some danger. There needs to be safety standards in place. People are illegally doing it in panchayat areas. If there are safety standards and all permissions, anyone can come to the director and get an NOC,” said Khaunte.","Tourism minister Rohan Khaunte has instructed the tourism director to initiate an enforcement drive to regulate the operations of shacks, water sports, adventure activities, and other tourism-related activities.

Rajasthan High Court: Live In Relationships to be registered,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/all-live-in-relationshipsto-be-registered-raj-hc/articleshow/117704120.cms,"Poll Do You Think Live-In Relationships Should Be Registered? No Yes

JAIPUR: The Rajasthan High Court on Wednesday ordered that live-in relationships must be registered by a govt established authority or tribunal until such time that the Union and state govts legislate on the subject.A single judge bench of Justice Anoop Kumar Dhand issued directions to the state govt and Union social welfare and justice secretary to draw up a legal format for registering live-in relationships, and sought compliance with the order by March 1. The court passed the order while hearing a writ petition for protection filed by a married woman from Fatehabad in Haryana who is in a live-in relationship with a man from Sikar district.Separately, the single bench requested the chief justice to constitute a larger bench to address the question of granting protection to married individuals cohabiting with unmarried partners or married persons from different marriages living together without dissolving their respective marriages.Emphasising that a law on live-in relationships is the need of the hour, Justice Dhand said legislation should be framed by the Centre and state govt. ""Till the enactment of the appropriate legislation by the govt, let a competent authority be established in each district of the state to look into the matter of registering such live-in-relationships, which will address and redress the grievances of such partners or couples who have entered into such a relationship and the children being born therefrom. Let a website portal be launched in this regard for redressal of the issue arising out of such a relationship,"" the court said.The HC sought fixing the liability of male and female partners in the form of a plan to bear the responsibility for education, health and upbringing of children born of such relationships. Additionally, the court said the liability of the male partner must be fixed for maintenance of his non-earning female partner in such a relationship and the children born of such a relationship.Though such relationships are often disapproved of by the society, they are not legally prohibited, the court said, pointing to couples in live-in relationships seeking judicial protection against threats from their families. ""Several couples in live-in relationships are facing threats from families. They approach constitutional courts seeking protection. Courts are inundated with such petitions. Every day dozens of petitions are submitted,"" the judge noted.Given the differing opinions of coordinate benches, Justice Dhand said it was necessary to refer the matter to a special bench for a definitive ruling.

AMRITSARThe Indian Overseas Congress ( IOC ) strongly objected to the deportation of illegal Indian immigrants , who were reportedly handcuffed and transported aboard a US military aircraft back to India.Condemning the treatment as undignified, the IOC stressed that these Indians were not criminals but victims of difficult circumstances and vowed to raise the issue at every level.""We, the people of Indian origin, are deeply disturbed to learn that Indian nationals who were illegally staying in the US were shackled and sent back to India on a military aircraft. This is unacceptable,"" said Rajwinder Singh, a senior IOC leader, while speaking toover the phone from California on Wednesday. He stated that an online meeting was held with IOC leaders in the US and Europe to condemn the mistreatment of fellow Indians, the use of a military aircraft for deportation, and India's decision to allow the plane to land.Citing the Colombian President ’s refusal to grant permission for a US military aircraft carrying deportees to land in Colombia, Mohinder Singh, a resident of New York, questioned why the Indian government allowed such a plane to land in India.""We wonder why the Indian government permitted a US military aircraft to transport deported Indians when they could have easily been sent back on civilian flights,"" he said, adding that this decision made India appear weak in the eyes of the international community.""We also suspect that the military aircraft could be equipped with high-end surveillance equipment or that there might be other strategic reasons behind allowing a military plane to be used for this purpose,"" he opined.Shudh Singh from Dallas added that IOC members from Europe also attended the meeting, where everyone strongly condemned the treatment of these Indians by the US, particularly the use of handcuffs and a military aircraft.""We have decided to make this a major issue, especially regarding India’s apparent deference to the US government, both through Congress leadership in India and at the global level,"" he said.
