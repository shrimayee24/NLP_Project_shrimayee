Twelve labourers from Pilibhit, reportedly stranded and facing harassment in Kyrgyzstan, are at the centre of a detailed report submitted by the district administration to the Uttar Pradesh Home Department, officials said on Friday.District magistrate Gyanendra Singh stated that the report was prepared following a directive from the Home Department, which had asked for factual details and instructed the Superintendent of Police to conduct an inquiry.“Information about all 12 persons stranded in Kyrgyzstan has been compiled and sent to the government so that the due process can be initiated for their safe return,” Singh was quoted as saying by PTI.The families identified the workers as Ravi Kumar, Ajay, Chandrapal, Santram, Rohit, Ramesh, Harswaroop, Shyamcharan, Sanjeev, Prempal, Ramasare, and Harishankar, saying they were sent to Kyrgyzstan nearly three months ago by agents of a local recruitment agency. Each worker reportedly paid around Rs 2.5 lakh and was sent on a 59-day visa under “misleading contracts,” relatives claimed.The families alleged that the men are being forced to work in different cities, denied adequate food, and prevented from returning home.They further claimed the workers were being beaten and treated “worse than animals.”Families of the stranded labourers have alleged that the men are being tortured abroad, and that local agents are demanding up to Rs 2 lakh for their return. The workers have also been sending video messages to their families, pleading for rescue.Relatives have repeatedly approached police and administrative officials for assistance. Earlier this week, several family members met with Singh and superintendent of police Abhishek Yadav to recount the ordeal.Officials stated that all 12 workers want to return to India as soon as possible, and their video appeals have been included in the ongoing investigation. According to the district magistrate, the administration’s report will assist the state government in taking steps to facilitate their repatriation, PTI.SP Abhishek Yadav confirmed that the case has been assigned to CO City Deepak Chaturvedi for investigation. He said the families have submitted written complaints alleging that a local firm operating from a city colony, along with its representatives, played a role in sending the workers abroad on false promises.","Twelve labourers from Pilibhit are reportedly stranded and facing harassment in Kyrgyzstan.

NEW DELHI: The Red Fort complex in the heart of the capital will be the venue of the 20th session of the Intergovernmental Committee for Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage from Dec 8-13 with over 1,000 delegates from more than 185 countries expected to participate. The inauguration will be held on Sunday.Undeterred by the blast that occurred on Nov 10 near the historical monument, the govt is going all out to uphold the spirit of India and send out a strong message from the Red Fort complex, also a Unesco World Heritage Site.From varied galleries showcasing art, history and artefacts to states setting up stalls to present India’s diverse culture and stage performances — the Red Fort is all set to bring alive the India story over the next one week in one place. The culture ministry plans to keep the cultural components and the galleries open even after the meeting is over so that people can visit them over the next one month in the run-up to Republic Day on Jan 26.The meeting is not only a significant platform for cultural diplomacy and showcasing India’s soft power, but also important as it has formally proposed the festival of Diwali for inclusion in Unesco’s Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH) list.India’s nomination will be examined for inscription on the list at the session. This will mark a significant step to gain global recognition for this major festival, following previous Indian inclusions like Durga Puja in Kolkata, Kumbh Mela, Buddhist chanting of Ladakh, Yoga, Nawrouz and Garba of Gujarat.India currently has 15 elements inscribed on Unesco’s Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.On why Red Fort was chosen, culture minister Gajendra Shekhawat said one day when he came with officials to the site to review the state of maintenance and management of the monument, this thought came up that why not hold this global meet on intangible heritage in a Unesco World Heritage site. “It was challenging but everyone in the ministry worked hard as a team. They kept working despite the recent incident (the blast case near Red Fort) that you saw. Three new galleries have also been readied. We are now ready to welcome the dignitaries,” he added.The meeting will examine nominations submitted by state parties for inscription on the Unesco ICH list, review the status of existing elements and provide international assistance for safeguarding intangible cultural heritage.","The Red Fort complex in the heart of the capital will be the venue of the 20th session of the Intergovernmental Committee for Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage from Dec 8-13.

New Delhi: India and Russia on Friday vowed to scale up bilateral trade to $100 billion by 2030, with PM Narendra Modi saying the target could be ach-ieved ""well ahead of schedule"".""Considering the tremendous potential in our partnership, I am confident that we will achieve this target well ahead of schedule. We are making rapid progress towards this goal,"" Modi said, recalling the target of $100 billion that he and President Vladimir Putin had set last year. The two leaders were speaking at the India-Russia Business Forum.Modi said India and Russia could jointly drive growth in the Global South with India's leadership in affordable EVs, two-wheelers and CNG mobility and Russia's strength in advanced materials, and could collaborate in vaccine development, cancer therapy and automotive components.The PM said both countries were ""actively working"" towards the early conclusion of the Free Trade Agreement with the Eurasian Economic Union - comprising Russia, Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan.Putin said Moscow wanted to deepen cooperation across security, economy, trade and culture. ""What we want is the development of our multi-faceted relations with India in various fields,"" he said. Russian companies, he added, were ready to ""increase manifold"" their purchases of Indian goods and services.He stressed that free trade would require resilient payment systems and insurance mechanisms, an issue that has complicated settlements since financial sanctions on Russia. Putin said Russia was looking to expand energy cooperation with India and ready to ensure uninterrupted fuel shipments. Moscow, he said, was open to joint work on small modular reactors and even floating nuclear power plants. He also wanted to enhance industrial cooperation with a focus on new technologies such as AI.The first round of talks on FTA between India and the Russia-led Eurasian Economic Union began last week. India wants to increase the composition of products in its trade basket with Russia as India exported goods worth $4.9 billion to Russia in 2024-25, while importing goods worth $63.8 billion, primarily crude oil and petroleum products, with a trade imbalance of $59 billion.","India and Russia vow to scale up bilateral trade to $100 billion by 2030.

Nations reaffirm anti-terror commitment

NEW DELHI: The long-standing extensive defence partnership between India and Russia will “reorient” itself from largely a buyer-seller relationship at present to joint R&D, co-development and co-production of advanced military technologies and systems.The joint statement issued after the Modi-Putin summit said this was in tune with India’s quest for self-reliance in defence production. Both sides agreed to encourage joint manufacturing in India of spare parts, components and other products for maintenance of Russian-origin arms as well as defence equipment under the Make in India programme through transfer of technology, it said.The two countries will also work to set up joint ventures to meet the needs of the Indian armed forces as well as “subsequently export to mutually friendly third countries”, it added.While no fresh defence deal was inked during the summit, as was expected, the delegation-level meeting between defence minister Rajnath Singh and his Russian counterpart Andrei Belousov on Thursday discussed India’s plan to procure another five squadrons of the S-400 ‘Triumf’ air defence systems and Rs 10,000 crore worth of their surface-to-air missiles for existing units, which performed extremely well during Operation Sindoor, as was earlier reported by TOI.In the air defence arena, India is also looking to acquire short-range Pantsir and man-portable Verba surface-to-air missile systems. Another procurement on the anvil is R-37 air-to-air missiles, with a range of over 200km, and its advanced version called RVV-BD to arm upgraded Sukhoi-30MKI fighters in IAF’s combat fleet.Joint production of advanced and lightweight variants of BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles also figured in the talks. These BrahMos-NG missiles, for instance, will be able to arm even lightweight fighters instead of the present ones that only heavyweight Sukhoi-30MKI jets can carry.PM Narendra Modi and President Vladimir Putin expressed satisfaction with the regular military contacts between the two countries, while appreciating the ‘Indra’ joint military exercises between their armed forces. They reaffirmed their commitment to maintain the momentum of joint military cooperation activities and expand military delegation exchanges, the statement said.PM Narendra Modi and President Vladimir Putin reaffirmed their strong commitment to preventing and countering terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, including cross-border movement of terrorists and terrorist financing networks and safe havens.“India and Russia have long stood shoulder to shoulder in the fight against terrorism. Whether it is the terrorist attack in Pahalgam, or the cowardly attack at Crocus City Hall, the root of all such incidents is the same. India firmly believes that terrorism is a direct assault on the values of humanity, and that global unity against it is our greatest strength,” said Modi in his media statement. According to the joint statement, the leaders unequivocally condemned all acts of terrorism as criminal and unjustifiable, regardless of their motivation by any “religious or ideological pretexts, whenever, wherever, and by whomsoever they may be committed”.They also called for actions against all UN-listed terrorist groups and entities, including al-Qaida, ISIS/Daesh and their affiliates, aimed at rooting out terrorists’ safe havens.","The long-standing extensive defence partnership between India and Russia will ‘reorient itself from largely a buyer-seller relationship at present to joint R&D, co-development and co-production of advanced military technologies and systems’ Both sides agreed to encourage joint manufacturing in India of spare parts, components and other products for maintenance of Russian-origin arms.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125798463,imgsize-198992,width-400,resizemode-4/india-russia-defence-ministers-meeting.jpg"

Putin, Modi Supercharge India’s Atomic Future With Big Reactor Push And Next-Gen Mini Reactors

NEW DELHI: As the world watched the India-Russia summit intently, hoping PM Narendra Modi would nudge President Vladimir Putin towards an early end to the Ukraine war, Modi’s message to the president going into the bilateral meeting was that the welfare of the world lay in the path to peace that the international community must work together to find. Modi reiterated that India was not neutral but on the side of peace, while backing all recent efforts to bring the war to an end.Putin thanked Modi for his efforts to seek a solution and briefed him on ongoing efforts, including with the US, to resolve the crisis peacefully. Both leaders were very upfront about sharing their perspectives as they brought the issue up in their televised opening remarks, with Modi attributing their continued exchanges on Ukraine to the trust they share in their relationship.“We support every effort for peace and we stand shoulder to shoulder with every effort for peace. The entire world has passed through many crises, from Covid until now. We hope that very soon the world will get relief from these worries and on the path of progress in the right direction, a new hope will emerge for the global community,” said Modi, expressing confidence that ongoing efforts would soon see the world headed towards peace.He also said India had always been ready to contribute to such efforts and would remain so.India will hope that Modi’s message, along with the fact that there was no big-ticket announcement in sensitive areas like defence, will help soothe frayed nerves in the West, which has been visibly riled by India’s hosting of Putin, even if under the 25-year-old annual summit mechanism. India is in the advanced stages of a free trade agreement with both the US, which has slapped a 25% tariff on India for its oil trade with Russia, and EU.With EU at least, India is hoping to conclude negotiations in the next few weeks as it would clear the ground for a successful India-EU summit on Jan 27. Brussels has closely followed Putin’s visit, concerned that it could throw a spanner in its efforts to upgrade the relationship with India through the FTA, for which both sides are still required to address contentious issues like EU’s carbon tax and its insistence on a commitment to the Paris Agreement in the bilateral trade agreement. However, except for the optics of the summit, it’s unlikely that EU would tie itself up in knots over the outcomes that focused mostly on areas like economic cooperation, healthcare, migration and media.India’s fresh call for peace followed its decision earlier this week to abstain from voting on a UNGA resolution demanding an end to Russia’s forced relocation of Ukrainian children.“We have had continuous discussions on Ukraine. You have also, from time to time, as a true friend, kept us informed of all matters. I believe that this trust is a great strength. I have discussed this subject many times with you and have also placed it before the world: the welfare of the world lies in the path of peace. We must all search for the path to peace together,” said Modi in his opening remarks.In his opening remarks, Putin said he discussed at length the Ukraine issue with Modi at the private dinner the PM hosted for him on Thursday. “I could share a great deal of details about the events taking place in Ukraine and what is being undertaken by us jointly with some other partners, including the US, on the question of a possible peaceful settlement of this crisis. And the actions we are taking together with some partners including the US on a possible peaceful settlement,” said Putin, adding that the relationship with India was characterised by substance.","India will hope that Modi’s message, along with the fact that there was no big- ticket announcement in sensitive areas like defence, will help soothe frayed nerves in the West. Putin thanked Modi for his efforts to seek a solution and briefed him on ongoing efforts, including with the US.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125798449,imgsize-41860,width-400,resizemode-4/pm-modi.jpg"

Here are Prime Minister Narendra Modi's top quotes from the joint press conference

My friend President Putin, delegates from both countries - I am happy to welcome President Putin for the 23rd India–Russia Bilateral Summit. Twenty-five years ago, President Putin laid the foundation of our strategic partnership.

The world has witnessed many ups and downs in the last eight decades. However, the friendship between India and Russia has remained like a pole star. This relationship is built on mutual respect and trust... Today, we have held discussions on all factors that will help strengthen this relationship.

Energy security has been a strong pillar of our partnership, and we will continue this win-win cooperation. Our collaboration in civil nuclear energy has spanned decades and contributed to clean energy. Our cooperation in critical minerals is essential for maintaining a diverse and reliable global supply chain.

This year in October, millions of devotees received the blessings of Lord Buddha's sacred relics at the International Buddhist Forum in Kalmykia. I'm pleased that we will soon be launching a free 30-day e-tourist visa and a 30-day Group Tourist Visa for Russian citizen.

Top quotes from Putin's address

We are ready to continue uninterrupted shipments of fuel for the growing Indian economy.

I thank President of India, Droupadi Murmu, Prime Minister of India and all our Indian colleagues for the warm and hospitable welcome accorded to the Russian delegation...I thank PM Modi for the dinner at his residence yesterday.

Last year, our bilateral trade turnover grew by 12 per cent, setting a new record. We are currently forecasting that this year’s trade agreement will remain at the same impressive level.

The Prime Minister gave us a list of challenges that deserve the attention of both governments, and we will act on them. The creation of a Free Trade Agreement between India and the Eurasian Economic Union will help. Our countries are gradually moving to mutual settlements in national currencies, which already account for 96% of commercial transactions. We are also witnessing successful partnerships in energy - stable supplies of oil, gas, coal, and everything required for India’s energy needs.

India and Russia have long been standing shoulder to shoulder in the fight against terrorism. Whether it is the terrorist attack in Pahalgam or the cowardly attack on the Crocus City Hall, the root of all these incidents is the same. India's unwavering belief is that terrorism is a direct assault on the values of humanity and that global unity against it is our greatest strength. India and Russia have close cooperation in the UN, G20, BRICS, SCO, and other forums. We will continue our dialogue and cooperation in all these forums.

Our country, for the last half a century, has been helping to arm and modernise the Indian Army, including the Air Defence Forces, aviation, and the Navy. In general, we are undoubtedly satisfied with the results of the negotiation we just had...I can express my confidence that the current visit and the agreements reached will help further deepen the Russian-Indian strategic partnership for the benefit of our countries and the people, the peoples of India and Russia.

NEW DELHI: IndiGo's operational crisis entered its fourth straight day on Friday, triggering widespread chaos at airports across the country, leaving thousands of passengers stranded with no food, no water, vacant counters and lost luggages.IndiGo has suspended all departures from Delhi Airport until midnight on Friday, intensifying the ongoing travel chaos. This comes a day after the airline cancelled over 550 domestic and international flights, far exceeding its usual daily disruptions. The worst-hit routes were those connecting Pune, Bengaluru, Mumbai, Delhi, Hyderabad, and Goa, triggering delays and congestion across major airports nationwide.According to PTI, airport-wise cancellations included 118 in Mumbai, 100 in Bengaluru, 75 in Hyderabad, 35 in Kolkata, 26 in Chennai and 11 in Goa, with several other airports reporting disruptions as well.Across airports, frustrated passengers complained about long queues, no staff support, uncertainty over alternative flights and hours-long waits at baggage belts.Many shared photos on X showing crowds sleeping on luggage, overflowing check-in areas and piles of unattended bags — unsure whether to go home or hope for a last-minute update.Sharing a post on X, one user wrote, ""Spent the last 4h at Bangalore airport. Some people have been here for more than 13 hours. Every single Indigo flight has been delayed significantly and then cancelled. I still find privilege in having the opportunity to try and get on any flight so I can get to my meetings, yet, no flights available until 24h from now. This is not progress. Thousands stranded.""Inside the terminal, long queues snaked across check-in counters and security lines, with seating areas completely full. A passenger travelling to Bengaluru told TOI that, ""My flight was scheduled to depart at 2.15 pm on Thursday. I rushed to see if I could get a ticket on another airline. But a ticket to Bengaluru had become pricier than a seat at a Taylor Swift concert. Clearly, other carriers were indulging in 'surge pricing. '""Later, when the passengers asked an IndiGo staffer about their delayed flight, he reportedly said: ""The plane is ready, but we don’t have a pilot to fly it,"" offering no clear answers on the delay or cancellation.At several airports, frustration boiled over — angry flyers protested at gates, and the chaos even disrupted boarding for other airlines.Airlines reportedly increased fares amid the crunch. A Delhi–Bengaluru ticket for Friday/Saturday ranged between Rs 11,000 and Rs 43,145, while Mumbai–Kolkata fares touched Rs 19,000.With IndiGo operating 65% of India’s domestic market, disruptions have hit other carriers too. Aircraft stuck at airports like Pune delayed the movement of other airlines.The DGCA held multiple emergency meetings and directed IndiGo to stabilise operations immediately and ensure fares do not rise due to reduced capacity.""To reduce passenger inconvenience while maintaining safety margins, IndiGo has requested operational variations/exemptions from specific FDTL provisions for A320 operations up to 10th February 2026. IndiGo has assured DGCA that corrective actions are underway and that normalized and stable operations will be fully restored by 10 February 2026,"" the DGCA said after meeting the airline management.IndiGo assured the regulator that ""normalized and stable operations will be fully restored by 10 February 2026."" The DGCA has asked IndiGo to submit a detailed roadmap on pilot hiring, training schedules, roster restructuring and safety assessments. A 15-day progress report is now mandatory.A DGCA inspection at Delhi’s Terminal 1 found passenger-handling manpower ""inadequate,"" and the airline has been told to urgently increase staff across affected terminals.Pilot associations have criticised IndiGo for poor planning. The Federation of Indian Pilots (FIP) alleged that despite getting a two-year preparatory window before the full implementation of new flight duty and rest period norms for cockpit crew, ""inexplicably adopted a hiring freeze"".In a statement on X, IndiGo said, ""The last two days have seen widespread disruption across IndiGo’s network and operations. We extend a heartfelt apology to all our customers and industry stakeholders who have been impacted by these events. IndiGo teams are working diligently and making all efforts with the support of MOCA, DGCA, BCAS, AAI and airport operators to reduce the cascading impact of these delays and restore normalcy. ""The airline urged passengers to check flight status before travelling.IndiGo has informed the regulator that more cancellations are likely in the coming days. Flight operations will be trimmed from December 8 to reduce disruptions.IndiGo operates more than 400 aircraft, runs over 2,300 flights daily, connects 90+ domestic and 45+ international destinations, and flew 118 million passengers in FY25. It was recently named ""Best Airline in India and South Asia"" at the 2025 Skytrax Awards.The government on Friday placed the new Flight Duty Time Limitation (FDTL) rules in abeyance with immediate effect, saying the step was taken “solely in the interest of passengers” without compromising safety.Aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu said the pause aims to stabilise IndiGo’s operations, which saw over 1000 cancellations today, with airports like Delhi witnessing no IndiGo departures.The ministry has ordered a high-level inquiry to fix accountability and prevent future disruptions.Airlines must now issue automatic refunds, provide hotel stays for stranded passengers, and prioritise seniors and persons with disabilities. Full normalisation is expected by Monday.The government has ordered an independent probe after preliminary findings pointed to gaps in IndiGo’s internal oversight, operational preparedness, and compliance planning.A four-member committee—comprising Joint DG Sanjay K. Bramhane, Deputy DG Amit Gupta, SFOI Capt. Kapil Manglik and FOI Capt. Lokesh Rampal—has been tasked with a comprehensive review of how the crisis escalated.The panel will examine causes of the disruption, manpower and rostering adequacy, compliance with revised FDTL norms, accountability for planning failures, and the airline’s mitigation efforts. It will submit its findings within 15 days for necessary regulatory action.IndiGo CEO Pieter Elbers on Friday said the airline expects fewer than 1,000 cancellations on Saturday, adding that operations should stabilise between December 10 and 15.Apologising to passengers, he said earlier corrective steps were insufficient, prompting a full system “reboot” that led to over 1,000 cancellations today, the highest so far.Elbers said DGCA’s relief in the implementation of FDTL norms was “of great help”.IndiGo, which usually operates 2,300 flights daily, has sharply reduced services as planning gaps triggered massive disruption nationwide.The government expects schedules to progressively improve over the weekend.Civil aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu has held IndiGo’s “mismanagement” of crew planning under the new FDTL rules responsible for the massive disruptions.He was quoted by ANI as saying that other airlines had adapted to the revised flying-time norms, but IndiGo failed despite months of engagement by the ministry.The government has granted the airline temporary abeyance from FDTL norms and formed a committee to identify accountability.Naidu said the immediate priority is restoring normalcy, clearing airport backlogs, and ensuring support for affected passengers.He added that congestion should ease from tomorrow, with airports expected to return to regular flow.Indian Railways has stepped in to absorb the massive travel demand created by the IndiGo crisis, deploying 116 extra coaches on 37 trains across 114 augmented trips.These additions can carry up to 4,000 passengers per trip, accommodating 4,89,288 travellers overall. The Railways is also rolling out 30 new special trains with 18 coaches each, capable of transporting 30,780 passengers per trip, covering 21,16,800 passengers across 57 trips.With Northern Railways planning more specials, the overall arrangements are designed to handle 35,000 passengers per day, ensuring connectivity for nearly 26 lakh travellers during this period.IndiGo attributed the disruption to ""unforeseen operational challenges"" including technical issues, weather interruptions and the rollout of revised crew duty rules (FDTL norms).The DGCA, however, said the disruptions stemmed from misjudging manpower needs under the new rules that limit pilot duty hours and night landings. After reviewing data, the regulator said the airline’s crew requirements ""exceeded their anticipation"".IndiGo told the regulator that it currently has 2,357 captains and 2,194 first officers available for December. But the airline’s crew requirement has sharply risen since the second phase of the FDTL rules kicked in. In November, IndiGo needed 2,422 captains and 2,153 first officers, higher than October’s requirement of 2,186 captains and 1,948 first officers.The data shows a clear crew shortage, which is a major reason behind the ongoing flight disruptions. With the new FDTL norms also limiting the number of night landings per pilot, night operations have been hit the hardest. The airline admitted that crew requirements were higher than expected and shared its updated projections with the regulator.IndiGo underestimated how many crew members it would need after the second phase of FDTL rules kicked in on November 1. Despite this, the airline increased its domestic flights by 6% — from 14,158 in the summer schedule to 15,014 in the winter schedule starting October 26.This mismatch between flights and available pilots and crew has created a major crunch, turning into a double blow for passengers: cancelled flights and skyrocketing fares.""These disruptions have arisen primarily from misjudgement and planning gaps in implementing phase 2 of the flight duty time limitation, with the airline accepting the actual crew requirement for new (rules) exceeded their anticipation,"" the DGCA added.","IndiGo has suspended all departures from Delhi Airport until midnight on Friday. This comes a day after the airline cancelled over 550 domestic and international flights, far exceeding its usual daily disruptions. The worst-hit routes were those connecting Pune, Bengaluru, Mumbai, Delhi, Hyderabad, and Goa.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125780312,imgsize-106896,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

IndiGo says more cancellation in next few days

NEW DELHI: The Civil Aviation Ministry and the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) have launched an intensive review and monitoring exercise after IndiGo reported widespread operational disruptions and an unusually high number of flight cancellations across its network since late November 2025.Civil Aviation Minister reviewed the situation with senior MoCA officials and IndiGo’s top management, directing the airline and all relevant aviation bodies to take urgent steps to assist passengers and stabilise operations. The Ministry said it is keeping a “close watch” on the situation, according to DGCA's statement cited by ANI.""In addition, the Civil Aviation Minister has also held a meeting with senior officers of the Airport Authority of India and instructed AAI to inform all airport directors that they should constantly monitor the situation and provide all support to stranded passengers. He also directed DGCA to closely monitor the airfares during the flight disruptions/cancellations,"" according to the released statement.Apart from the ministry, DGCA, in a detailed review meeting chaired by the Director General (Civil Aviation), flagged concerns over IndiGo cancelling 170–200 flights per day, a level significantly higher than normal for the country’s largest airline.IndiGo attributed the disruptions to transitional challenges from the implementation of the revised Flight Duty Time Limitations (FDTL) Civil Aviation Requirements, which came into effect in two phases — 01 July 2025 and 01 November 2025 — following court directions.The airline said the new fatigue-management rules, crew-planning issues, and winter operational constraints have sharply impacted scheduling stability.DGCA has directed IndiGo to normalise operations at the earliest and ensure that the current situation does not lead to fare increases.IndiGo has been instructed to submit:As DGCA released its statement assuring firm corrective action and close monitoring, IndiGo, however, informed the regulator that stabilising its network will require a short transition period. The airline told DGCA that additional cancellations will continue over the next two to three days as part of its schedule-reset effort aimed at restoring roster balance and preventing further last-minute disruptions, as reported by PTI.IndiGo has also conveyed that it will proactively scale down flight operations starting December 8 to minimise passenger inconvenience and allow crew-planning teams to rebuild buffers eroded over recent weeks. According to the airline, this controlled reduction in operations is essential to streamline rosters, align crew availability with revised Flight Duty Time Limitation (FDTL) norms and ensure that fatigue-management standards are fully complied with.The carrier has assured DGCA that corrective measures are already underway and that full operational stability will be restored by February 10, 2026.

‘Excessive conditions’ in public dealings must be set aside as illegal: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/excessive-conditions-in-public-dealings-must-be-set-aside-as-illegal-sc/articleshow/125798396.cms,"Simplicity in transactions good governance, says SC

Insistence on unnecessary documentation and circuitous procedures in govt offices remain a harrowing experience for citizens of the country. But in an important decision to simplify administrative procedures and infuse reform, Supreme Court on Friday ruled that govt’s insistence on unnecessary, excessive requirements in public dealings must be set aside as illegal.Terming simplified processes as a hallmark of good governance, a bench of Justices P S Narasimha and Atul S Chandurkar said the authorities must resist imposing superfluous and redundant requirements as they make any procedure complicated, causing loss of time and, also, peace of mind.The bench declared a memo issued in 2009 by Jharkhand govt illegal on the basis that it was not needed. The memo mandated an additional recommendation of assistant registrar as a pre-condition for registration of a document under Section 9A of Indian Stamp Act. The court said that when a cooperative society is registered, the certificate of registration signed and sealed by the registrar shall be conclusive evidence.The additional requirement imposed by govt, SC noted, is “disruptive to ease of transaction, without any value addition to the integrity of the transaction”.“Simplicity in public transactions is good governance. Constitutional courts uphold this virtue to strengthen the rule of law and ensure access to justice.In administrative law, simplicity means laws, regulations and procedures should be clear, straightforward and easy to understand, allowing for effortless compliance. Administrative procedures should avoid complexity, redundant requirements and unnecessary burdens, which waste time, expense, and disturb peace of mind,” Justice Narasimha, who penned the judgment for the bench, said.“While higher courts set aside executive decisions on the grounds of illegality if they are not founded on relevant considerations, or even when the decisions are based on irrelevant considerations, it is important to recognise the principle that executive actions that mandate certain unnecessary, excessive requirements must equally be set aside as illegal,” he said.The court further elaborated that “irrelevant consideration includes insistence or performance of acts or submission of documents, which neither have relevance nor are value additions to the purpose or object of law or policy in place. Instead, they are demonstrably superfluous and unnecessary, consuming limited time and human resources. This also has a direct bearing on efficiency and good governance...”The bench said administrative law has well recognised the principle of an administrative decision becoming unlawful if the decision fails to take into account relevant considerations, or even when it takes into account irrelevant considerations.","Supreme Court rules that govt’s insistence on unnecessary, excessive requirements in public dealings must be set aside as illegal.

All IndiGo flights to Delhi were cancelled on Friday due to 'operational issues', prompting many travellers - especially those headed for international connections at IGI Airport - to book last-minute taxis. Several passengers told TOI that they had to fork out nearly twice the normal fare of Rs 5,000-6,000.Those who had time switched to trains, but most had to cough up extra for a cab ride. Arun Kumar and Naina, who were headed to Canada, said they had no option but to book a cab after their flight to Delhi was cancelled. ""We paid Rs 10,000 for a taxi to IGI. Just last week, our friends went for Rs 5,500,"" they said.In Nagpur, abrupt disruptions & repeated cancellations forced hundreds of passengers to turn to private sleeper bus operators, who stepped in to travel to major metros like Mumbai and Bengaluru at short notice. Unlike Chandigarh, however, operators did not hike charges despite the sudden influx, said private bus operator Mukesh Chaurasiya, who runs a fleet of sleeper coaches. ""We charged normal fares. People were genuinely relieved because they had no other option left,"" he said.""Yesterday alone, I provided four to five buses from Nagpur to Mumbai after flights got cancelled. My buses even had to go directly to the airport because so many passengers were stranded, especially after the Bengaluru flight was cancelled,"" Chaurasiya told TOI.""Even today, five to seven buses are coming from Mumbai to Nagpur. We're getting inquiries from Delhi and other cities as well, but our capacity is limited,"" he added.Other private bus operators, too, confirmed a spike in emergency bookings. When TOI checked online fares for Saturday's buses from Nagpur to Mumbai, the AC sleeper seats were less than Rs 3,000. Fares on Nagpur-Bengaluru route showed a hike, but there seemed to be little to no inflation for other destinations like Pune and Hyderabad.","All IndiGo flights to Delhi were cancelled on Friday due to 'operational issues' Many travellers - especially those headed for international connections at IGI Airport - had to book last-minute taxis.

Massive Outrage Over IndiGo Chaos, Over 600 Flights Cancelled In India's Biggest Aviation Crisis

New Delhi: Mass flight cancellations by IndiGo have sent fares on competing airlines soaring as passengers scramble for alternatives on routes dominated by India's largest carrier.One-way economy tickets for Sunday on Delhi-Mumbai sector range from Rs 21,577 to Rs 39,000 across airlines other than IndiGo. Bengaluru-Kolkata tickets cost between Rs 20,000 and Rs 23,000 each while Chennai-Delhi seats are priced around Rs 21,000.IndiGo, which holds 64% of India's domestic market share, has told passengers it expects to resume normal operations between Dec 10 and 15. Seats on available IndiGo flights scheduled for the next several days cost roughly half the price of competitors due to the uncertainty caused by operational disruptions.The remaining airlines - Air India, Air India Express, SpiceJet and Akasa Air - collectively control 36% of domestic capacity. When passengers avoid IndiGo and concentrate demand on this smaller pool of seats, fares invariably increase based on supply constraints. Regional routes show even sharper increases. Udaipur-Delhi one-way economy tickets for Sunday cost between Rs 15,367 and Rs 26,406 on non-IndiGo carriers.Udaipur-Mumbai fares range from Rs 24,000 to Rs 35,000.Mahima Shukla, a Delhi-based CA, flew to Udaipur Friday by Air India Express and was to return Sunday on an IndiGo flight. ""I am trying to cancel that ticket as I have to be in office Monday. Udaipur-Delhi on other airlines costs upwards of Rs 21,000. This is a double whammy,"" she said.A Delhi-based businessman termed the crisis ""possibly the worst phase in Indian aviation in many years"". ""While fares are skyrocketing, our confidence levels have nosedived,"" he said.","One-way economy tickets for Sunday on Delhi-Mumbai sector range from Rs 21,577 to Rs 39,000 across airlines other than IndiGo.

Exemptions will put safety at risk, says pilots’ body

NEW DELHI: Govt has put on hold the new flight duty time limitation (FDTL) norms for pilots with “immediate effect for now” and expects normalcy in IndiGo operations to be restored by Dec 15.The aviation ministry’s decision came Friday when over 1,000 IndiGo flights — more than half its schedule — were cancelled, with none operating from Delhi, wreaking havoc on plans of lakhs of fliers. IndiGo is offering full waiver on cancellation /reschedule requests on travel from Dec 5 to 15. On Saturday, less than 1,000 flights are likely to be cancelled. The number will gradually fall.On Thursday — when its on-time performance touched its nadir at 8.5% — IndiGo had sought exemption from certain norms, such as the cap on number of night landings a pilot can make between midnight and 6am, to restore normalcy in Airbus A320 operations by Feb 10, 2026. Since that was a long way off, govt put Directorate General of Civil Aviation’s FDTL orders in abeyance.The week-long flight operation disruptions in IndiGo has wiped out nearly Rs 20,000 crore worth of market value for Interglobe Aviations, the company that runs the airline. In past one week, the stock has fallen nearly 9% to Rs 5,371 on BSE at Friday’s close with the airlines major’s current market cap at nearly Rs 2.1 lakh crore now.From its Nov 28 close at Rs 5,904 on BSE, the stock had fallen to an intra-day low of Rs 5,266 during Friday’s session. However, after DGCA allowed the airlines some temporary leeway with crew management rules, the stock recovered some ground to close at Rs 5,371, market players said.While IndiGo’s stock suffered due to the ongoing crisis, the stock price of SpiceJet, one of its smaller competitors, gained. Friday SpiceJet stock price rallied 2.5% on BSE to close at Rs 31.Putting on hold Friday its orders meant to ensure that pilots are not fatigued, thereby boosting flight safety, govt said the move will not compromise on safety of passengers. “This decision has been taken solely in the interest of passengers, especially senior citizens, students, patients and others who rely on timely air travel for essential needs... taken urgent measures to address the ongoing disruption in flight schedules, particularly those of IndiGo,” Union aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu said.DGCA has constituted a four-member committee headed by a joint DG for a “comprehensive review and assessment of circumstances leading to operational disruption of IndiGo. Committee will identify accountabilities for failure and adequacy of subsequent mitigation measures being taken by IndiGo,” a govt statement said.Aviation authorities say all possible steps are being taken to stabilise IndiGo operations at the earliest. DGCA has offered its Airbus A320-type-rated flight operations inspectors (FOIs) to operate flights for IndiGo in an attempt to help the airline recover from its lowest operational point in over 19 years of existence. “FOIs operate a flight every month (to keep their licences valid). We have made this offer to IndiGo, they did not ask for it, to help it get back on its feet as quickly as possible,” said sources.A significant number of pilots for IndiGo and for some other Indian carriers are upset at losing their hard-earned right to a more humane roster. “Airlines treat us as mere cost-cutting items in their income and expenditure statements during their good days. When it fell on bad days last month, we helped as much as working at 120%. But that could not have gone on indefinitely as we remember how they treat us,” said many senior pilots.Sensing the simmering discontent, Naidu held meetings over video links with some pilot bodies and assured them that the exemption from the new FDTL was temporary. DGCA chief Faiz Ahmed Kidwai issued an appeal to pilots’ associations as the aviation sector is under “significant stress”.“As we now approach fog season, peak holiday period, and marriage travel season, it is crucial that the industry prepares for even greater operational challenges. Passenger volumes are expected to rise sharply, and weather-related impacts may further complicate scheduling and flight safety. Given this situation, we earnestly request full cooperation of all pilot bodies, associations, and pilots across India,” Ahmed’s letter says.IndiGo CEO Pieter Elbers issued a video statement saying normalcy could return between Dec 10 and 15, while admitting the crisis had “shaken customers’ belief in IndiGo’s reliability, built over the last 19 years”.Hours after govt relaxed key provisions of the new duty-and-rest norms to help IndiGo stabilise its pilot roster and flight operations, the Indian pilot community criticised the civil aviation regulator, demanding that the said dispensations be withdrawn immediately.The relaxations now allow IndiGo to roster its pilots for longer duty hours than permitted under Phase II of revised Flight Duty Time Limitations (FDTL) norms, which came into effect on Nov 1 after a preparatory period of about two years. FDTL norms are mandatory regulatory limits that define the maximum duty hours and minimum rest periods that should be factored in when rostering pilots for duty so as to keep crew fatigue under check and maintain operational safety. Each country formulates its own FDTL based on specific operational realities and scientific studies.In a strongly worded letter to DGCA, Airline Pilots’ Association of India (ALPA) said selective exemptions compromise safety and undermine the intent of the rules. The union also sought a probe into what it termed an “artificial pilot-shortage narrative” created by IndiGo, punitive action against the airline’s accountable management, and full enforcement of Phase II of the FDTL without exemptions. Airlines in India adopted Phase II of FDTL on Nov 1.The dispensations have destroyed regulatory parity, undermined public trust in DGCA’s neutrality, compromised scientifically established fatigue protections, and placed millions of passengers at heightened risk, said ALPA. Aviation safety expert Capt Amit Singh said the changes bypass the established procedure for exemptions. “These are ad hoc changes. There was no pilot representation before these changes were made,” he said, adding that exemptions must follow safety risk assessments in line with International Civil Aviation Organisation norms.Meanwhile, ALPA’s strongest objection pertained to changes in night operations; relaxation of the definition of night (midnight to 5am was extended in the new FDTL to midnight to 6am) and doubling of permitted landings “encroaching night” — the return to the 5am definition means that a pilot rostered for, say, 5.30am, will not be considered as flying night operations — from two to four, contradicting the revised FDTL and “fundamentally diluting” fatigue protections.DGCA has effectively acknowledged that IndiGo pilots will now fly with reduced rest and increased fatigue, placing passengers at higher risk, it said. It referred to a Nov 24 meeting ALPA had with DGCA in which it was “unequivocally agreed” that no dispensation, exemption or variation, especially for commercial reasons, would be granted to any operator. “FDTL norms exist solely to safeguard human life, and any dilution would expose pilots, passengers, and aircraft to unacceptable risks,” it said.The association questioned why widespread disruptions surfaced 35 days after Phase II came into force: IndiGo had nearly two years to prepare for the Nov 1 implementation of Phase II of revised duty and rest rules for pilot rostering. “These events raise serious concerns that an artificial crisis was engineered to exert pressure on govt for commercial gain under the pretext of public inconvenience.”ALPA warned that if the dispensations are not revoked, DGCA, and not pilots, must bear responsibility for any fatigue-related incident arising from the relaxations.","The week-long flight operation disruptions in IndiGo has wiped out nearly Rs 20,000 crore worth of market value for Interglobe Aviations, the company that runs the airline.

Watch: MPs Speak Out as SIR Row Dominates Winter Session Opening

NEW DELHI: Govt does not wish for India to ever face UPA-era shortages of weapons, ammunition and equipment again, and wants a steady flow of revenue to keep its defence capabilities ready to meet the needs of modern warfare, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said Friday as Lok Sabha passed a bill to levy a cess on pan masala manufacturing units to augment national security and public health.In her reply to the debate on the ‘Health Security se National Security Cess Bill’, Sitharaman spoke at length on the govt’s defence priorities and touched on Operation Sindoor to emphasise that modern conflicts are becoming capital-intensive due to the domination of precision weapons, autonomous system, space assets and cyber operations, making it imperative to constantly update technology.She said, “We need resources and we need to understand that it does not come cheap. Therefore, more resources towards the specific objective of strengthening defence will have to be made.”Highlighting PM Modi’s Independence Day announcement of Mission Sudarshan Chakra to protect infrastructure and key installations, she said, “Enemy should not be given a chance to penetrate. If an enemy dares, our ‘sudarshan chakra’ will destroy them. That is the capability we want to bring in.” The new cess on pan masala was needed as the effective tax incidence on it will fall from 88% to 40%, the maximum GST slab for demerit goods, once GST compensation cess ends, making it cheaper.It will be detrimental for public health, she told the House.Opposition members offered a variety of criticisms of the bill, including a swipe on whether pan masala consumers are going to finance national defence, and if govt has become so desperate it is raising revenue through such a cess.Addressing the criticism, she said it is her duty as finance minister to raise revenue to meet various demands. No govt, since 1947, has given so much relief in direct and indirect taxation within a year, she said in reference to the big relief in income tax and GST rationalisation that made everyday items cheaper.The purpose of the bill is to create a “dedicated and predictable resource stream” for two domains of national importance — health and national security, she said, terming the pan masala industry as highly evasion prone. Turning to CAG reports and statements of govt functionaries from the UPA era, she said soldiers were left in the Himalayan cold without boots, woollens and, at times, food for want for resources. Artillery guns were not procured for decades after the Bofors episode and a then minister said the country does not have enough money for procurement, she added.As health is a state subject, the govt will be sharing a part of the cess with states, she said. Centre has provided more than what it collected from the cess between 2014-15 to 2025-26.Reeling out data of transfer of funds to states, she said Rs 6.4 lakh crore in cess was transferred, while the govt collected Rs 6 lakh crore from health and education from 2014–15 to 2025–26.",Lok Sabha passes bill to levy a cess on pan masala manufacturing units to augment national security and public health.

NEW DELHI: India remains the centre of malaria transmission in the WHO South-East Asia Region, accounting for 73.3% of all estimated cases and nearly 89% of malaria deaths in 2024, even as the region records one of the world’s steepest declines in malaria, World Malaria Report 2025 showed.The region logged 4.79 lakh cases in 2024 — a 65.7% fall since 2015 — and just 99 reported deaths, but WHO estimates indicated a far larger burden of 2.7 million cases and 3,900 deaths, with India driving most infections and fatalities.Despite this dominance, India remains on track to meet the 2025 Global Technical Strategy goal of a 75% drop in incidence, having crossed a 70% reduction by 2024. Most districts continue to report sustained declines, tho-ugh localised outbreaks in forest belts and cross-border spillover from Nepal persist as major challenges.Children under 5 accounted for 8.7% of cases and 18% of deaths, while P.vivax, notoriously difficult to eliminate, caused nearly two-thirds of infections. The report credits the gains to aggressive interventions — large insecticide-treated net drives in India, Myanmar and Nepal; 143% growth in rapid testing since 2015; and 100% treatment coverage. Low-level pfhrp2/3 gene deletions were detected in India, but treatment failure for key ACTs remained below 5%, indicating continued drug efficacy.A key milestone highlighted was India’s exit from High Burden to High Impact group in 2024, marking its shift from a global high-burden nation to one nearing elimination in several states — a transformation few countries have achieved at this scale. Bhutan, Sri Lanka and Timor-Leste are malaria-free. WHO warns drug resistance, climate-related outbreaks and declining international funding threaten global progress.Dr Sunil Rana of Asian Hospital said malaria persists in India because timely healthcare fails to reach tribal and forest communities. “Longer mosquito-breeding seasons, delayed care-seeking, weak surveillance and unchecked migration through border zones keep outbreaks alive,” he said.","India accounts for 73.3% of all estimated cases and nearly 89% of malaria deaths in 2024.

""Derogatory"" BJP Hits Out at Revanth Reddy Over Remarks On Hindu Deities

NEW DELHI: Congress neta Sonia Gandhi Friday alleged that the main goal of BJP establishment is to erase Jawaharlal Nehru and to destroy the social, political and economic foundations on which India has been founded.She said the forces behind the drive against Nehru “belong to the ideology that had no role in our freedom movement, or in the making of our Constitution.” She said the same ideology fanned the atmosphere of hate which led to the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi , and it continues to glorify Gandhi’s assassins. “It is an ideology with a bigoted and viciously communal outlook. Its approach to nationhood is based on stoking prejudices of all kinds,” she said.Sonia said it is natural that a monumental figure like Nehru’s life will be analysed and critiqued, but it has become a widespread practice to divorce Nehru from the challenges he faced and view him without a historical context.“While we welcome on-going analysis of his (Nehru) contributions, what is not acceptable is systematic attempt being made to denigrate, distort, and defame him. The sole objective of this is to not only diminish him as a personality, But also to demolish his multi-faceted legacy in a crude and self-serving attempt to rewrite history,” she added.","Congress neta Sonia Gandhi alleged that the main goal of BJP establishment is to erase Jawaharlal Nehru.

'Like Pole Star': PM Modi Lauds Strong Ties With Russia; Hails Moscow's Support In War On Terror

Relationship built on trust has stood test of time: PM

NEW DELHI: Amidst the turbulence the world has witnessed in the past eight decades, the India-Russia relationship has remained like the pole star, resting on mutual respect and trust, said PM Modi as both sides reaffirmed their commitment to upgrading the economic partnership in the summit with President Putin.The two countries signed more than a dozen agreements and MoUs, including in health, migration and maritime cooperation, and adopted a framework for economic cooperation that is expected to boost trade to $100 billion by 2030, as Putin said Russia is ready to continue uninterrupted shipments of fuel to India.Russia is a reliable supplier of oil, gas, coal, and everything required for development of India’s energy, said Putin, hailing India’s “independent and self-sufficient” foreign policy. The Indian side maintained its energy partners, old or new, understood the need for diversification, given its focus on securing energy interests and the stability in oil prices.While there was a “general discussion” on defence including the Make in India initiative and legacy cooperation, foreign secretary Vikram Misri said the focus was on economic cooperation and efforts to ensure balanced and sustainable trade by facilitating more Indian exports to Russia.Both leaders also strongly backed ongoing efforts for early conclusion of a Free Trade Agreement with Eurasian Economic Union. Modi underlined the significance of civil nuclear cooperation, saying energy security has been a strong and vital pillar of the India-Russia partnership.“Over the past eight decades, the world has witnessed many ups and downs. Humanity has faced numerous challenges and crises. Yet, through all of this, the India-Russia friendship has remained steady like a guiding star. Built on mutual respect and deep trust, our relationship has stood the test of time,” said Modi, adding the new economic cooperation programme till 2030 would make trade and investment diversified and balanced. He said cooperation in critical minerals was vital to ensure secure and diversified supply chains across the world.India announced a free 30-day e-tourist visa and a 30-day group tourist visa for Russian citizens. The manpower mobility agreement will create new strength and new opportunities for both countries, said Modi, who also raised the need for early release of Indians serving in the Russian army with Putin.According to a joint statement — as both sides called for comprehensive reform of UN Security Council to reflect contemporary global realities — Russia reiterated its steadfast support for India’s permanent membership in a reformed council.Putin also said Russia and India were conducting independent foreign policy together with like-minded countries in BRICS and SCO and promoting a more “just and democratic multipolar world order”. “We are defending the main principles of the international law enshrined in the UN Charter. Among them, the right of any country for its own way of development and the preservation of their cultural civilisational identity, respect for sovereignty, careful balance of interests of all participants of the world community,” said Putin.“In general, we are undoubtedly satisfied with the results of the negotiations we just had,” said Putin in his media statement.On international issues, the leaders endorsed their cooperation in keeping Afghanistan free of terrorism and stressed the importance of resolving the Iran nuclear issue through dialogue. They also expressed concern, according to the joint statement, over the humanitarian situation in Gaza.","The two countries signed more than a dozen agreements and MoUs, including in health, migration and maritime cooperation.

After S-400 Gamechanger, Putin & Modi Set For S-500 Monster Missile Pact | Full Detail

Tough to give India S-500 systems as of now, says official

NEW DELHI: India and Russia on Thursday agreed to further enhance their expansive defence partnership, including through collaboration in niche military technologies and stronger defence-industrial cooperation, which is likely to see Moscow continuing as New Delhi’s leading arms supplier for the foreseeable future, reports Rajat Pandit.Ahead of the Modi-Putin summit, defence minister Rajnath Singh and his Russian counterpart Andrei Belousov stressed ties were based on “a deep sense of trust, common principles and mutual respect” while inking a protocol on “ongoing and prospective areas” of defence cooperation.The 22nd inter-governmental commission on military and military-technical cooperation, co-chaired by the ministers, underlined India’s intent to retain its strategic autonomy despite mounting pressure from the US and EU to distance itself from Russia.Sources said discussions ranged from India acquiring additional S-400 Triumf air defence systems and their surface-to-air missiles in large numbers to upgrading IAF’s Sukhoi-30MKI fighter fleet and arming them with long-range R-37 and RVV-BD air-to-air missiles.The joint production of advanced variants of BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles as well as procurement of short-range Pantsir and man-portable Verba air defence systems also figured in the talks.“It will be difficult for Russia to supply advanced S-500 air defence systems as of now even if India wants them. Its fifth-generation Sukhoi-57 fighters are also on offer, but India is yet to take a decision,” an official said.Taking note during the meeting of the special and privileged strategic partnership with Russia, Rajnath Singh said India is determined to expand the capacity of its indigenous defence industry for both local production and exports under the aegis of ‘ Atmanirbhar Bharat ’ policy.Belousov, in turn, said Russian defence industry was ready to support India towards becoming self-reliant in defence production, highlighting that both the countries were “united by many years of friendship and strategic cooperation”.India also wants Russia to expedite deliveries of critical military hardware that have been hugely delayed due to the Ukraine war. These include the two remaining squadrons of the five S-400 squadrons contracted for $5.43 billion in 2018 as well as the advanced Akula-class nuclear attack submarine, which was supposed to arrive this year on a 10-year lease under the $3 billion deal signed in March 2019. “Russia says the two S-400 squadrons will be delivered next year, while the submarine will come in 2028,” a source said.India plans to acquire another five S-400 squadrons, while defence ministry has also cleared the Rs 10,000 crore procurement of 280 of its missiles with interception ranges of 120km, 200km, 250km and 380km to replenish stocks used during the May 7-10 cross-border hostilities with Pakistan as well as build reserves, as was earlier reported by TOI.IAF also wants R-37 air-to-air missiles, with a range of over 200km, and its advanced version called RVV-BD to arm its upgraded Sukhoi-30MKI fighters. This will counter Pakistan’s use of Chinese-origin jets like J-10s armed with PL-15 long-range missiles that initially caught it off-guard during Operation Sindoor.Advanced lighter versions of BrahMos missiles, whose strike range has already been enhanced to 450km from the initial 290km and will eventually go up to 800km, are also on the cards.While the heavyweight Sukhoi fighters armed with BrahMos missiles had carried out long-range precision strikes against Pakistan during Operation Sindoor, the plan now is to go for smaller air-launched BrahMos-NG missiles that can be carried by lightweight jets as well.The total value of the deals inked with Indo-Russian joint venture BrahMos Aerospace has crossed Rs 58,000 crore over the years, with the missiles with a 2.8-Mach speed becoming the prime conventional precision strike weapons for IAF, Navy and Army.","India and Russia agree to further enhance their expansive defence partnership.

Linus breaks down the $26M figure, revenue mix, and why predictable income matters for creators who operate like companies

He Made $26M on YouTube...But Nearly Lost It All (Linus Tech Tips Interview)





Popular tech YouTuber Linus Sebastian recently offered a rare insight into the financial earnings and business strategies behind his uber successful channel Linus Tech Tips. In a new interview with Jon Youshaei, Sebastian opened up not just staggering numbers the channel has pulled in, but also about the financial infrastructure that keeps Linus Media Group stable and evolving with time.The conversation clearly shows how Sebastian's sharp wit and intellect shaped his empire. One can witness the inspirational journey of how a channel with nine billion lifetime views has slowly evolved into a multi-stream business that does not solely depend on ads. The company is currently thriving, and Sebastian credits his supporters for all it has achieved so far.At the four-minute mark of Youshaei’s video, Sebastian invited him into his YouTube Studio dashboard. That’s when Youshaei started reading out the staggering achievements of Sebastian’s channel, including nine billion lifetime views, reaching a peak of 8.4 million views in a single day, and “over $26.3 million” earned through AdSense.When asked if the $26.3 million was made through his individual effort, Sebastian quickly clarified that it was made possible through the company. He said, “I haven’t. Linus Media Group, Inc. has done $26 million in revenue through YouTube AdSense… Linus Media Group has paid more than $26 million in salaries.”Later in the video, the pair went deeper into the channel’s revenue breakdown, including from YouTube Adsense (11.6%), Fully Branded Videos (12.5%), Products (55.4%), Memberships (7.2%), Sponsorships (9.2%), etc. Sebastian gave a shoutout to his supporters who have been substantial in his success story, stating,He stated, “Those are from our incredible supporters… And we have over 40,000 of them right now.And they’re awesome, and I can count on that. YouTube AdSense, I can count on that to a degree, but it’s more volatile.” He also added that FloatPlane “never has a spike, but it never really has a big dip. It's been pretty consistent growth overall.”Interestingly, this new interview comes months after Sebastian acknowledged a drop in the channel’s viewership in September 2025. Rather than seeing it as a setback, Sebastian continued to work hard, strategized ways to battle fluctuation and come back strong, ultimately building his business to new heights.Also read: Why are fans questioning Pokimane’s relationship status amid celibacy rumors?

'US Benefited Immensely From Indians', Says Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Warns US Against Scrapping H-1B

How Elon Musk sees AI and robotics reshaping global industries





Elon Musk: A Different Conversation w/ Nikhil Kamath | Full Episode | People by WTF Ep. 16

Elon Musk’s prediction of AI-driven instant manufacturing





Elon Musk’s view of AI evolving beyond human well-being goals





Elon Musk’s vision of a future where ‘money becomes irrelevant’









Elon Musk has once again shared a striking prediction about the future of human labour. During a conversation on Nikhil Kamath’s People by WTF podcast, the Tesla and SpaceX chief suggested that the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence and robotics is pushing society towards a future where humans no longer need to work to survive. Musk’s view is rooted in the belief that machines will eventually handle all essential tasks, allowing people to approach work as a creative or recreational activity rather than an economic necessity.He expressed strong confidence that the world could reach this turning point within the next two decades. For Musk, this future is not a distant fantasy but a likely outcome of the accelerating technological breakthroughs unfolding today.Musk argued that the extraordinary pace of development in AI models, autonomous systems, and humanoid robots is already rapidly reshaping industries worldwide. According to him, the next phase of technological growth will create intelligent machines that can replicate or even surpass human capability in almost every domain, from manufacturing and logistics to healthcare, education, and creative services.He believes that this massive transition may occur much sooner than most people expect, possibly within ten to fifteen years. Musk compared future labour to home gardening. Just as people may choose to grow vegetables for enjoyment rather than necessity, he thinks future generations will increasingly engage in work for personal fulfilment, creativity, or social contribution rather than mere survival. The essential work that maintains society will be managed entirely by advanced automated systems that require minimal or no human oversight.A core part of Musk’s argument is that AI systems will eventually be able to create anything a person can imagine. His own AI company, xAI, along with its chatbot Grok, reflects his belief that increasingly capable generative systems will expand into physical production through robotics, automation, and smart manufacturing techniques. As these technologies combine, they could enable a world where scarcity becomes obsolete and resource distribution becomes more equitable. Musk visualises a future in which goods and services can be produced instantly and efficiently.He emphasised that the ability to turn ideas into tangible products without traditional labour inputs would fundamentally reshape economies, social structures, and the global workforce. Once technology reaches this stage, he thinks most constraints on human consumption and lifestyle will disappear, creating unprecedented opportunities for innovation, creativity, and human progress.Musk also explored a lesser-discussed aspect of hyper-advanced AI. He suggested that there may come a time when AI and robotics complete every possible task aimed at improving human well-being. After satisfying all imaginable human desires and demands, these systems could reach a saturation point where they no longer have meaningful human-centred tasks to perform.At that stage, Musk believes AI may begin working on activities that serve its own optimisation because the catalogue of tasks that benefit humanity is finite. This idea raises profound questions about the long-term relationship between humans and intelligent machines once human needs are no longer the defining force behind technological activity. Musk’s predictions extend far beyond the automation of work. At the US Saudi Investment Forum earlier this month, he stated that humanoid robots and AI systems have the potential to eliminate poverty. His argument relies on the assumption that when machines can produce goods for virtually no cost and at limitless volume, wealth becomes universal because essential resources are accessible to everyone.If machines can meet all human needs, the traditional economic struggle for income, resources, and opportunity would disappear. Musk envisions a world where every person benefits equally from the capabilities of intelligent robots that can generate abundance without relying on human labour.In his discussion with Kamath, Musk introduced an even more radical idea. He predicted that money might eventually lose its relevance. In his view, money exists primarily as a tool for allocating labour and determining the value of goods that require human effort to produce. If production becomes entirely automated and unlimited, the need for money as a mechanism for distribution fades.Musk suggested that in such a world, the primary form of value might shift towards power generation. Energy would become the foundational currency because machines require it to operate, create and sustain the systems that support human life. The economy would therefore revolve around energy capacity rather than labour or manufactured goods.","Elon Musk has shared a striking prediction about the future of human labour.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. A greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/exemptions is the need of the hour.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

Massive Outrage Over IndiGo Chaos, Over 600 Flights Cancelled In India's Biggest Aviation Crisis

A four-member committee to review operational disruptions

NEW DELHI: Passengers across India faced travel disruption after IndiGo cancelled over 1,000 flights amid operational chaos, with the government putting new pilot duty time rules on hold to restore services.At Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport in Ahmedabad, passengers were seen queuing amid cancellations.One traveller described the impact on a major competition, ""I was scheduled to go to Guwahati on a 6.15 am flight; this was a connecting flight from Kolkata. We were selected for Smart India Hackathon 2025; about 74,000 ideas were submitted there and nearly 1400 ideas were selected. Our centre was North-Eastern Hill University and we were scheduled to perform there. We had booked IndiGo flights. But the flight is delayed and so, we will not be able to go there. There is no other possible way of transportation. If we take a train, it will take us 3 days to reach there. Our hard work of 6-7 months is now wasted. We are returning home. Such opportunities are rare...We were selected in the first attempt but due to flight cancellation, we are unable to go ahead. We were a team of 6 people and we were accompanied by 2 mentors...""Other passengers reported luggage and travel issues. One said, ""I was stranded in Kolkata and Hyderabad for 2 days. Somehow, I came (to Indore) through another airline and my luggage is still lost. I am here for the same...""Another added, ""My luggage has not arrived since 2 days and there is no information. I came to Indore on December 3rd via an IndiGo flight... They have given me a propriety report and a contact number, which is not being received.""Among those stranded was 37-year-old Mangaljeet Singh from Ludhiana, who was seen sitting outside Gate 2 of Terminal 2 with his family at Delhi's IGI airport.""Their first flight from Ludhiana to Delhi via Amritsar had been cancelled, forcing them to travel to the capital by road, only to find out that their connecting flight to Visakhapatnam via Hyderabad was also cancelled. His son's national skating competition has been postponed by a day due to similar delays faced by several participants. The family of five could secure only two tickets on another airline, leaving Singh's wife, 3-year-old daughter and 64-year-old mother with no other option but to return to Ludhiana. If my son misses the competition, his year-long efforts will come to naught,"" Singh said.At Terminal 1, 34-year-old Rinpuii from Aizawl was seen carrying her unwell two-year-old daughter, trying to reach a medical professional in Thiruvananthapuram. Standing outside the airline ticket counter for at least five hours, she met 22-year-old Carolyn, a Delhi resident also travelling home to Aizawl.""They have nowhere to stay in Delhi. And she does not know when she can board the flight home,"" Carolyn said.Pankaj Gupta from Alwar was another passenger struggling to manage disrupted travel. The 26-year-old had brought his elderly parents to Delhi for a vacation and hoped to surprise them with a flight home via Jaipur.""They have never boarded a flight and were so happy when they realised that we were entering the airport. Then, despair took over,"" Gupta said.Outside Terminal 2's Gate 5, a group of 30 tourists from Raipur, Chhattisgarh, returning from Dharamshala, reported waiting at the airport for two days. Hemit Navdia, 23, who was marshalling the group, said:""It's costing me a lot extra to manage so many people in this condition. We don't have any accommodation here. The airport authority has finally given us some food.""The government suspended the Directorate General of Civil Aviation’s (DGCA) Flight Duty Time Limitations (FDTL) orders with immediate effect. Union aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu said the move prioritised passengers.""This decision has been taken solely in the interest of passengers, especially senior citizens, students, patients and others who rely on timely air travel for essential needs... taken urgent measures to address the ongoing disruption in flight schedules, particularly those of IndiGo.""DGCA has set up a four-member committee to review the operational disruptions and assess accountability. Aviation authorities have offered their Airbus A320-type-rated flight operations inspectors (FOIs) to help IndiGo resume operations.Senior pilots expressed frustration over working conditions. One said, ""Airlines treat us as mere cost-cutting items in their income and expenditure statements during their good days. When it fell on bad days last month, we helped as much as working at 120%. But that could not have gone on indefinitely as we remember how they treat us.""DGCA chief Faiz Ahmed Kidwai urged pilots for cooperation, citing upcoming travel pressures, ""As we now approach fog season, peak holiday period, and marriage travel season, it is crucial that the industry prepares for even greater operational challenges. Passenger volumes are expected to rise sharply, and weather-related impacts may further complicate scheduling and flight safety. Given this situation, we earnestly request full cooperation of all pilot bodies, associations, and pilots across India. ""IndiGo CEO Pieter Elbers admitted the crisis had affected passenger confidence but said normal operations could return between 10 and 15 December.","Passengers across India faced travel disruption after IndiGo cancelled over 1,000 flights. The government put new pilot duty time rules on hold to restore services. A four-member committee has been set up to review operational disruptions and assess accountability.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125799237,imgsize-131068,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/-.jpg"
Explained: Why UK universities are saying no students from Pakistan and Bangladesh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/explained-why-uk-universities-are-saying-no-to-pakistani-and-bangaldeshi-students/articleshow/125764326.cms,"What prompted the sudden restrictions?





Indian student’s honest UK student journey: Expectations vs Reality

Which universities have halted or paused recruitment?





A growing list of institutions has already moved to protect their compliance status:

University of Chester has suspended recruitment from Pakistan until autumn 2026, citing an unexpected rise in visa refusals.

has suspended recruitment from Pakistan until autumn 2026, citing an unexpected rise in visa refusals. University of Wolverhampton is no longer taking undergraduate applicants from Pakistan and Bangladesh.

University of East London , Coventry, Sunderland and others have temporarily stopped recruitment from one or both countries.

, Coventry, Sunderland and others have temporarily stopped recruitment from one or both countries. University of Hertfordshire — under a Home Office-mandated action plan — has paused recruitment from both countries until 2026.

Oxford Brookes has paused undergraduate recruitment from Pakistan and Bangladesh for its January 2026 intake.

London Metropolitan University has stopped recruitment from Bangladesh entirely, saying the country accounted for 60 per cent of its visa refusals.

BPP University has temporarily paused recruitment from Pakistan as a risk-mitigation measure.

1. Higher scrutiny from the Home Office





2. Sharp rise in asylum claims





3. Uneven quality of overseas recruitment





How is this affecting students in Pakistan and Bangladesh?





Offers are being withdrawn late in the process

Applications are being paused or left in limbo

Some students have paid deposits they cannot recover

Many who were preparing to travel in January or spring 2026 now have no clear pathway

Why are universities so worried?





Tens of millions in lost tuition revenue

Layoffs and course closures

An irreversible reputational hit

Inability to recruit for key postgraduate programmes

What changes are universities making?





Increasing deposit requirements

Tightening financial documentation checks

Re-evaluating all partnerships with overseas agents

Diversifying recruitment to other markets

Introducing stricter pre-CAS interviews

Reducing exposure to any country with a high refusal risk

What does this mean for migration policy?





The bottom line









The irony is sharp. For years, British universities depended on international students to keep their books balanced and their campuses global. Now many of those same institutions are quietly shutting their doors to two of their biggest applicant pools. The sector insists this is about compliance, not discrimination, but the effect is unmistakable: students from Pakistan and Bangladesh are being blocked, deferred or dropped because universities fear breaching tougher Home Office rules.Here is the full breakdown.Several UK universities have stopped accepting new applications from Pakistan and Bangladesh after tighter Home Office rules made it riskier to sponsor students from countries with high visa refusal rates.The trigger is the overhaul of the Basic Compliance Assessment, the framework universities must meet to retain their student sponsor licence. Under the updated rules, no more than 5 per cent of an institution’s sponsored visa applications can be refused. The previous limit was 10 per cent.Pakistan and Bangladesh now sit well above the new threshold. Their refusal rates — roughly 18 per cent for Pakistan and 22 per cent for Bangladesh in the year to September 2025 — put universities at risk of sanctions, including losing their ability to enrol international students altogether.For many mid-tier and lower-fee institutions, that is an existential threat.Some institutions have reinstated certain programmes for the January intake, but most remain cautious.Why are refusal rates so high?Three major trends have converged:The government has tightened student-visa rules as part of a broader strategy to reduce net migration. Universities now face stricter monitoring of outcomes: refusal rates, enrolment follow-through, and student attendance.There has been a surge in asylum claims lodged by individuals who first entered the UK on a study or work visa. Ministers have warned universities that student routes must not become a “backdoor” to settlement.Some universities rely heavily on education agents to source students. Multiple insiders say poor vetting — particularly in high-volume markets — has led to a mix of strong applicants alongside others with weak documentation or questionable intentions.This combination has pushed refusal rates above the new threshold, putting institutions at risk of non-compliance.For thousands of genuine applicants, the consequences are immediate and painful:Education consultants in the region say the decisions are “heartbreaking” for students who did everything correctly but are caught in the crossfire of institutional risk-management.They also argue that UK universities themselves created the incentives that led to aggressive agent recruitment, weak documentation and fraudulent applications — and are now punishing students for it.The new rules are unforgiving. If a university breaches the 5 per cent refusal cap or other compliance metrics, it can lose its licence to sponsor international students for at least a year.A one-year loss could mean:Officials estimate that at least 22 universities would fail at least one compliance criterion if no corrective action is taken. Five of them could lose their sponsorship rights outright, cutting an estimated 12,000 international students from the system.For lower-fee universities, heavily dependent on international enrolments, even a brief suspension could be fatal.Institutions are now:The result is a cautious and sometimes blunt response: cutting entire markets to protect compliance.The UK government has made it clear that the new rules are intended to restore public confidence in the international student route. Ministers argue that genuine students remain welcome but institutions must take greater responsibility for screening applicants. At the same time, universities warn that the reforms will reshape the sector — reducing diversity, limiting access for students from developing countries, and pushing institutions toward more profitable markets such as China and the Gulf. The Home Office maintains that it “strongly values” international students but insists that only genuine applicants should come to the UK.The freeze on recruitment from Pakistan and Bangladesh is not a political statement by universities. It is a defensive manoeuvre forced by tougher immigration rules, high refusal rates and the fear of losing the right to sponsor students altogether. But regardless of the intention, the impact is immediate: thousands of South Asian students now find their UK education plans derailed, delayed or dropped — not because of their merit, but because the system around them changed overnight.","Several UK universities have stopped accepting new applications from Pakistan and Bangladesh after tighter Home Office rules.

Just touched down in Saudi Arabia and eager to get behind the wheel? Whether you're planning to navigate Riyadh's busy streets or take a leisurely drive through Jeddah, your first step is to figure out if your foreign driving license can be easily converted, or if you'll need to start fresh.Whether you're a new resident or a long-term expat, this guide breaks down the process of converting your license or applying for a new Saudi driving license. We’ve got you covered with everything you need to know, so you won’t be left guessing.Foreigners are allowed to drive in Saudi Arabia under certain conditions. If you hold a valid international or foreign driving license, you can legally drive for up to one year from your date of arrival in the Kingdom, or until your license expires, whichever comes first. After this period, or if you become a resident, you will need to obtain a Saudi driving license.If you're from India, Europe, or any other country, you can drive in Saudi Arabia for up to one year using your home country’s driving license. However, you must carry both your original license and a translated International Driving Permit (IDP). The IDP is required by law for driving on a foreign license in Saudi Arabia, as it serves as an official translation of your original license.Keep in mind that driving without a valid Saudi or officially converted foreign license could result in fines or legal consequences, so be sure to get the necessary documentation in place before you hit the road.If you're planning to stay longer than a year, or you're applying for certain services, you’ll need to convert your license or obtain a new one, depending on where it's issued from.Saudi Arabia offers two different paths for obtaining a Saudi driving license, depending on where your original license was issued.If you're eligible for direct license conversion, meaning you hold a valid license from one of the approved countries, you can convert it directly into a Saudi license without the need to take a driving test. This process is much faster and more straightforward.However, if your home country is not on the approved list, you won’t be able to convert your license directly. Instead, you’ll need to apply as a new driver, which involves enrolling in a Saudi driving school. You’ll need to complete both theoretical and practical driving tests and pay for training sessions, testing, and issuance fees.If you hold a valid driving license from one of the 48 approved countries, including GCC countries, you’re generally eligible to convert it directly into a Saudi driving license, no driving test required. However, an application, proper translation, documentation, and a medical check are still mandatory.If your license is from one of these countries, here’s how you can convert it.Your first task is to get your driving license officially translated into Arabic. Without this step, the conversion process will not proceed.Use the official Absher portal ( absher.sa ) to book an appointment with the General Department of Traffic (Muroor).Use your bank’s online app to access Sadad under Government Payments and select “Driving License Issuance.”Visit an Efada-approved medical center for your health check, bringing:Tests include:On your appointment day, head to the designated Muroor office or traffic school with:Make sure you have your Iqama and all original documents ready, as they are required to complete your license issuance.If everything is in order and your license is from an approved country, you’ll receive your Saudi license the same day, no tests required.If your home country is not listed, you will need to apply as a new driver in Saudi Arabia. That means:This process is longer and involves multiple steps, including lessons and test scheduling, but is required for full legal driving eligibility in Saudi Arabia.Also read: How can foreigners obtain a Saudi driving license if they’re not eligible for direct conversion?",Saudi Arabia allows visitors from 48 countries to directly convert their driving licenses without a driving test.
