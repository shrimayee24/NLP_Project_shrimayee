India Signals Tough Stand On Rafale Fighter Jet Deal, Seeks Deep Localisation And Tech Transfer

NEW DELHI: French President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday said that Rafale fighter jets will boost India’s military strength and that he is committed to having more indigenous content in ‘made-in-India Rafale', as sought by the Modi govt.Speaking on the sidelines of the AI-India Summit at the end of his three-day visit, Macron told the French and Indian media, “Rafale improves the strategic relations between us, and it creates more jobs here.” On criticism in some western quarters over the performance of the 4.5-gen fighter, especially during Operation Sindoor last year, the President said, “I don't see how people can criticise the aircraft because it (Rafale) makes your country stronger. ”Macron said France and India are entering a new era of defence cooperation with plans to jointly produce Rafale fighter jets as well as helicopters.“On Rafale, what we want to do is expand. India confirmed a few days ago its willingness to command a new bunch of Rafales... 114... and to co-produce in India,” he said. India's expected order for another 114 Rafales is a “new step forward” in defence ties. On India’s demand for increasing indigenous content in the jet’s co-production, Macron said, “Very clearly, we are extremely, I would say, committed to having a maximum number of Indian components and manufacturing a maximum number of critical devices in India.... We will have increased cooperation in maintenance and diversification.”Showing his willingness to sell more French submarines to India, Macron cited the tie-up on Rafales to make his case. “I hope we will do it on submarines. We have offered additional capacities,"" he said. The Indian Navy currently operates six French Scorpene submarines and there are plans to have more -- at least three -- such submarines from France in the near future.The President said India's push to co-produce Rafale fighter jets is a “legitimate” ambition that aligns with the “direction of history.... Rafale is the key.” He underscored the long-term necessity of this partnership, predicting that India's requirement for advanced aviation will only grow in the coming decades. “Looking ahead to 2040 and 2050, I am telling you, India will need combat aviation,” Macron said.“We don’t have a strategic partnership, we have a global spatial strategic partnership, which is unique for both France and India,” he said.Macron’s reaction came just days after the Rajnath Singh-led Defence Acquisition Council gave the initial clearance for acquiring 114 more Rafale jets and the defence minister discussed the jet deal with his French counterpart Catherine Vautrin as part of the India-France annual defence dialogue on Tuesday.","France and India are entering a new era of defence cooperation with plans to jointly produce Rafale fighter jets as well as helicopters.

India Displays Naval Might At International Fleet Review 2026, President Murmu Lauds Indian Navy

NEW DELHI: India’s sea-based nuclear deterrent will be strengthened soon as the country’s third indigenous Arihant-class nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine (SSBN), INS Aridhaman (designated S4), is likely to be commissioned by April-May. “The commissioning of INS Aridhaman is expected by this summer as the submarine is currently in the final stages of sea trial,” a defence source told TOI.Last Dec, Navy chief Admiral D K Tripathi had said that INS Aridhaman would be commissioned this year.INS Aridhaman, built under the Advanced Technology Vessel (ATV) project at the Ship Building Centre in Visakhapatnam, will be larger (7,000 tonne) than predecessors INS Arihant and INS Arighaat (6,000 tonne), featuring enhanced capability to carry long-range K-4 missiles. INS Aridhaman will be armed with 24 K-15 Sagarika SLBMs (750 km range) and eight K-4 SLBMs (3,500 km range), which are capable of reaching most parts of Asia.Once it enters service, India will have three operational ballistic missile submarines under the Strategic Forces Command (SFC) at sea for the first time, moving the country closer to achieving ‘Continuous At-Sea Deterrence’, a strategic defence policy where a nation maintains at least one SSBN on patrol 365 days a year.As a stealthy underwater platform, INS Aridhaman boosts India’s “second-strike” capability—the ability to retaliate after a nuclear attack. It is designed to carry more long-range nuclear-tipped missiles than its predecessors INS Arihant and INS Arighaat.In addition to INS Aridhaman, the Indian Navy is securing an Akula-class SSN nuclear-powered attack submarine from Russia, commonly referred to as “Chakra III”, with expected delivery by 2027 or early 2028. Besides these submarine projects, India and Germany are in the final stages of negotiating a $8-10 billion Project-75(I) deal to build six advanced, conventional diesel-electric submarines equipped with Air-Independent Propulsion (AIP) technology.The new submarine acquisitions are timely as Pakistan is acquiring eight advanced Hangor-class diesel-electric attack submarines from China under a $5 billion 2015 deal to bolster its naval capabilities.INS Aridhaman is equipped with an 83 MW pressurised water reactor and advanced sonar suites, possesses indigenous USHUS and Panchendriya sonar systems for better target detection and has improved acoustic damping with anechoic tiles to reduce noise, making it harder to detect. Once operational, it will be based at Project Varsha, a high-security facility with underground pens near Visakhapatnam.","INS Aridhaman is India’s third indigenous Arihant-class nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine.

"Thyroid, infection drugs get fresh safety warnings after national review",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/thyroid-infection-drugs-get-fresh-safety-warnings-after-national-review/articleshow/128577149.cms,"Decision taken after national review

NEW DELHI: Two medicines used widely - antibiotic doxycycline and thyroid drug carbimazole - will soon carry stronger safety warnings, following a national review of adverse drug reaction reports.After examining patient-level safety data, regulators have flagged possible mental health symptoms linked to doxycycline and a rare but potentially life-threatening blood disorder associated with carbimazole. In separate communications issued this month, Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) and Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) directed all State and Union territory licensing authorities to ensure manufacturers update prescribing information and package inserts for both medicines and report compliance.For doxycycline - commonly prescribed for respiratory infections, acne, sexually transmitted infections, urinary tract infection and numerous vector-borne diseases - the authorities have asked that specific central nervous system side effects be explicitly mentioned. These include restlessness, anxiety, irritability, nervousness and dizziness.The decision follows an assessment by Pharmacovigilance Programme of India, which reviewed adverse reaction reports and individual case safety data.The issue was examined at a Signal Review Panel meeting in March 2025 and later discussed by Subject Expert Committee (SEC) on antimicrobial and antiparasitic drugs in Jan 2026, which endorsed updating the official prescribing documents.While gastrointestinal discomfort and photosensitivity were already known side effects of doxycycline, the latest directive formally adds neuropsychiatric symptoms to the safety profile. Regulators have directed manufacturers of carbimazole - prescribed for hyperthyroidism, including Graves' disease - to prominently warn about agranulocytosis, a rare but serious condition marked by a sharp fall in white blood cells.Agranulocytosis can leave patients vulnerable to severe infections. Early warning signs include fever, sore throat and unexplained infections. The recommendation emerged from the 26th Signal Review Panel meeting and was subsequently reviewed by SEC on endocrinology and metabolism before being approved for inclusion in prescribing information leaflet.Dr Rommel Tickoo, director of Internal Medicine at Max Hospital, Saket, said the move reflects a maturing safety system. ""CDSCO's decision on for doxycycline and carbimazole reflects a proactive and responsible pharmacovigilance system. While the medicines remain safe and effective when used appropriately, clearer warnings help both doctors and patients recognise rare but important side effects early. In the case of carbimazole, prompt attention to symptoms like fever or sore throat can be life-saving. Such regulatory steps strengthen patient safety without creating unnecessary alarm,"" he said.For patients, the updated leaflets mean clearer information on risks. For clinicians, the advisory reinforces the need to counsel patients on warning symptoms and monitor use appropriately.",Two medicines used widely - antibiotic doxycycline and thyroid drug carbimazole - will soon carry stronger safety warnings. Decision taken after national review of adverse drug reaction reports. Regulators have flagged possible mental health symptoms linked to doxy cycline. They have also flagged a rare but potentially life-threatening blood disorder associated with carbIMazole.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128577130,imgsize-12810,width-400,resizemode-4/thyroid-infection-drugs-get-fresh-safety-warnings.jpg"

Why SC flagged freebies

Concern over impact on work culture &finances

Court issues notice but clarifies wider concern

Freebies: New currency of political power?

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday raised serious concerns over the growing culture of 'freebies' across states , warning that indiscriminate distribution of such benefits could hamper economic development and strain state finances. The top court also cautioned states and asked whether such a culture, without drawing a distinction between the haves and the have-nots, would amount to an ""appeasing policy.""Hearing a plea by Tamil Nadu Power Distribution Ltd, which plans to provide free electricity to all consumers regardless of their financial status, the court said welfare measures are justified for the poor, but extending them to everyone could weaken development efforts.A bench led by Chief Justice India Surya Kant, along with Justices Joymalya Bagchi and Vipul M Pancholi, pointed out that many states already face revenue deficits yet continue to announce large-scale free schemes.“Most of the states in the country are revenue deficit states and yet they are offering such freebies” overlooking development, the bench said.The judges stressed that excessive spending on freebies could slow economic progress and reduce funds available for infrastructure, jobs, and long-term growth.""The economic development of the nation will be hampered by this kind of largesse distribution. Yes, it is the State's duty to provide, but the ones who are enjoying freebies... is it not something that should be looked at?"" Chief Justice of India Surya Kant verbally observed.The CJI also questioned whether states were using their revenue wisely.""States are running into deficit but still giving freebies. See, 25 per cent of the revenue you collect in a year, why can it not be used for the development of the State?""The bench warned that indiscriminate distribution of benefits could affect productivity and reduce incentives to work.“What kind of culture are we developing in India? It is understandable that as part of the welfare measure you want to provide to those who are incapable of pay the electricity charges,” the bench asked.“But without drawing a distinction between those who can afford and those who cannot, you start distributing. Will it not amount to an appeasing policy,” the CJI asked.The court also questioned the timing of the Tamil Nadu power firm’s proposal.“The states should work to open avenues for employment. If you start giving free food from morning to evening then free cycle, then free electricity then who will work and then what will happen to the work culture,” the CJI said.JusticeBagchi added that states must properly justify such spending in their budgets.""It's not one State we are talking about, it's about all States. It is planned expenditure. Why don't you make Budget proposals and give justification that this is my outlay on unemployment of people?""Despite its sharp observations, the Suprme Court issued notice to the Centre and other parties on the petition filed by the DMK government-run power utility challenging electricity rules.The court clarified that its concern was not limited to Tamil Nadu but applied to all states offering similar schemes without proper financial planning.A report by Aequitas Investments noted that freebies have increasingly become a major electoral strategy.""As political parties compete in what appears to be a race to the bottom, welfare schemes and 'freebies' have evolved from mere campaign promises to the new currency of political power,"" the report said.","Suprme Court raises serious concerns over growing culture of 'freebies' across states.

"Certainty of enforcement, not just awareness, crucial to road safety push: Road transport secretary",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/certainty-of-enforcement-not-just-awareness-crucial-to-road-safety-push/articleshow/128575143.cms,"V Umashankar (File photo)

NEW DELHI: Mere awareness drives or campaigns will not be enough to reduce violations of road traffic rules and road crashes; rather, the “certainty of enforcement” will have a greater deterrent impact, Union road transport secretary V Umashankar said on Thursday while sharing details of the recently notified e-challan rules.Speaking at the release of the New Delhi Road Safety Declaration at the National Road Safety Confluence held at the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, Umashankar questioned whether a juvenile (referring to a recent case in Delhi) did not know that he was underage and should not have been driving a car, or whether the vehicle owner who modified a tourist bus — resulting in the deaths of more than 20 people in a fire — did not know that such modifications were illegal.“Forty-five percent of fatalities involve two-wheelers or people riding two-wheelers. We find that most of these deaths occurred because the rider was not wearing a helmet. Does he not know that wearing a helmet is good for him?” he observed. Umashankar said, “Awareness is not enough — what we need is organised, district-level action, backed by certainty of enforcement and supported by strong institutions. When compliance becomes a habit and accountability becomes certain, road safety will move from intention to impact.Mats-Ake Belin, global lead for the Decade of Action for Road Safety at the World Health Organization, said that road safety is now firmly on the global agenda, with strong political and media attention. “Our responsibility is to move beyond awareness and ensure consistent, evidence-based implementation so that no country is left behind in preventing road traffic deaths,” he added.The New Delhi Road Safety Declaration, aligned with the WHO Decade of Action for Road Safety, states that India records the highest number of road fatalities globally, with vulnerable road users — such as pedestrians, cyclists, two-wheeler riders, gig workers, and rural communities — being the most affected. Despite several initiatives, the absence of coordinated, institution-led action has limited national impact. “The declaration addresses this gap by adopting a Safe System approach, placing human life at the centre of all mobility decisions,” it said.The declaration, spearheaded by the Bharat Association of Road Safety Volunteers (BARS), an organisation comprising members from diverse fields, has set five pillars of action: strengthening road safety management through leadership at all levels; promoting open crash data, annual public reviews, dedicated funding, and enhanced enforcement; ensuring safer vehicles and fleets; promoting safer road users and improved post-crash response; and creating a safer driving environment.Participants included representatives from ministries, WHO and other multilateral agencies, civil society, academia, industry bodies, OEMs, technology innovators, and youth groups.","V Umashankar: What we need is organised, district-level action, backed by certainty of enforcement and supported by strong institutions. “When compliance becomes a habit and accountability becomes certain, road safety will move from intention to impact,” he said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128575122,imgsize-17756,width-400,resizemode-4/v-umashankar.jpg"

NEW DELHI: With Muhammad Yunus ’ departure from the power centre in Dhaka, steps are under way to “fully restore” all Indian visa services, India’s senior consular official in Sylhet, Aniruddha Das, has confirmed.Aniruddha Roy on Thursday assured full cooperation to strengthen India-Bangladesh relations and said efforts are being made to ease visa services.Speaking at the Sylhet District Press Club, he said medical and double-entry visas are currently being issued, and steps are under way to resume other categories, including travel visas.“Medical and double-entry visas are being issued now, and steps are under way to resume other categories, including travel visas,” BD News24 quoted him saying.He said India-Bangladesh ties are based on mutual respect and shared interests.“India-Bangladesh relations stand on the foundation of mutual respect and honour. The people of both countries will be the principal stakeholders of a stable, positive, constructive, long-term and mutually beneficial relationship,” he said.He added that both countries share cultural links and common goals, and cooperation can help create new opportunities.“We should transform our geographical and cultural proximity, growing economic capacity, and future aspirations into new opportunities through cooperation,” he said.He also said journalists can play an important role in strengthening ties between the two countries.“Through objective reporting and constructive criticism, journalists can further reinforce and strengthen this relationship,” he added.Days earlier, Bangladesh entered a new political phase after Tarique Rahman took charge as the country’s new prime minister. Following the Bangladesh Nationalist Party’s landslide victory, securing a two-thirds majority, Rahman invited Prime Minister Narendra Modi to attend his swearing-in ceremony.Prime Minister Modi congratulated Rahman on his party’s victory and later invited him to visit India after he took oath.India-Bangladesh relations had come under strain after Sheikh Hasina ’s exile in August 2024. Ties were affected during the interim government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, particularly after India provided refuge to the former prime minister Hasina. This led to tensions between the two countries, with several reports highlighting diplomatic unease in recent months.India had also expressed concern over incidents of violence against minorities, especially the Hindu community, during the period of unrest in Bangladesh under Yunus’ interim government.","India-Bangladesh relations had come under strain after Sheikh Hasina ’s exile in August 2024.

NEW DELHI: Fugitive businessman Vijay Mallya on Wednesday informed the Bombay high court that he cannot specify when he will return to India as he is legally barred from leaving the United Kingdom.In a statement submitted through his counsel Amit Desai, Mallya said that he does not have an active Indian passport and is also restrained by court orders in England and Wales from travelling outside the UK.The submission came after a bench of Chief Justice Shree Chandrashekhar and Justice Gautam Ankhad last week made it clear that it would not hear his plea challenging the order declaring him a fugitive economic offender unless he returns to India.The court had asked Mallya to clarify whether he intended to come back to the country.Mallya, who has been based in the UK since leaving India in March 2016, has filed two petitions before the high court, one challenging the order declaring him a fugitive economic offender and another questioning the constitutional validity of the Fugitive Economic Offenders Act.In his statement read out in court, Mallya said that he cannot give a definite date for his return as his passport was revoked by the Indian government in 2016 and because courts in England and Wales have prohibited him from leaving the country.“Mallya is not permitted to leave or attempt to leave England and Wales or apply for or be in possession of any international travel document. In any event, the petitioner is unable to precisely state when he will return to India,” Desai read out from the statement.The senior counsel further argued that Mallya’s physical presence in India was not necessary for the court to hear his pleas against the fugitive tag and the provisions of the Act.“If he (Mallya) were to appear in India, then all these proceedings would be rendered irrelevant as the statute says that once the offender appears in the concerned court of law, then all these orders would be set aside,” Desai told the court.Mallya, 70, faces multiple cases of alleged fraud and money laundering linked to the default of loans amounting to several thousand crores. He was declared a Fugitive Economic Offender in January 2019 by a special court hearing cases under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.The high court has directed the Union government to file its reply to Mallya’s statement and posted the matter for further hearing next month.","Vijay Mallya tells Bombay high court that he cannot specify when he will return to India.

MUMBAI: A suit dating back to the year India got independence finally stood disposed of by the Bombay high court this month, with the fourth generation of the original land owner amicably settling a property dispute. The estate included vast portions of the village of Dahisar in north Mumbai. The area was a whopping 2,891 acres or over 1,100 hectares. It was 3.5 times the size of Central Park in New York.Over the decades, the legal battle saw repeated pleas against sale of parcels of land in Dahisar to private parties, as well as an acquisition by the state under the Salsette Law and Forest Act.Justice Farhan Dubash, one of the newest judges of the high court, put a quietus via a consent term order to the legal tussle 78 years, or over three quarters of a century later, on a suit filed on Oct 7, 1947.The original suit had sought administration of the estate of one Haji Alimohammed Haji Cassum following his demise, as per personal laws applicable. It was filed by Badrushama, widow of Suleman Haji Alimohammed Haji Cassum, versus Salim Dawood Agboatwala and others.Justice Dubash, began his order with: ""This order disposes of probably the oldest Suit that is currently pending before the Bombay high court.""Over the years, several orders were passed in the matter, including a preliminary decree passed on Nov 25, 1952 that determined the legal share of all heirs.Before that, the HC appointed a court receiver in 1950 to look after the property. Successive generations continued the legal battle before the HC. Finally, with the litigation entering the fourth generation, all heirs decided to amicably settle. They filed consent terms before the HC on Feb 5. The terms were accepted, and the suit was struck off from a pendency list to a disposed one.This verdict resulted in one of the longest pending cases in the history of the Bombay HC coming to a close.The HC recorded the agreement arrived at between the parties after hearing Kevic Setalvad, senior counsel with advocate Vijaylaxmi Kulkarni appearing for the plaintiffs, and Anupam Surve, counsel with solicitor Nanu Hormasjee and Co for contesting heirs.The settlement was between Ateeq Anwar Agboatwala, a power of attorney holder for the first plaintiff, and other members of the Agboatwala family.At the end of the settlement, what was payable to the court receiver towards costs and charges in the matter was Rs 7 lakh. After deducting this amount, the rest of the undisclosed amount is to be returned on or before Feb 20, 2026 to the family.","A suit dating back to the year India got independence finally stood disposed of by the Bombay high court.

PM Modi Pushes Human Centric AI Model, Launches MANAV Framework At Mega AI Impact Summit 2026

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi pushed on Thursday for democratisation of AI, saying it must become a tool for inclusion and empowerment and a force for global good, especially across the Global South, while taking aim at countries and companies that consider AI to be a strategic asset that must be developed in secrecy.Questioning the walls that have come up around the development of AI as it is leveraged by countries and companies as a force and profit multiplier, Modi said India thinks different. ""It is said sunlight is the best disinfectant. We believe AI will benefit the world only when it is shared. When codes are open and shared, millions of young minds can make them safer and better. Therefore, let us resolve to develop AI as a global common good,"" he said.Speaking at the AI Impact Summit and with heads of foreign govts and tech giants and representatives of 100 countries in audience, Modi cautioned against reducing individuals to ""mere data points or raw material"" and unveiled India's approach of ""MANAV"" framework of ""responsible AI"". He said AI's transformative power must be a multiplier.At a time when fears have grown about AI, which, while generating impressive benefits in diverse fields, can lead to risks ranging from autonomous weapon systems, machines breaking free of control of developers, and breakthroughs widening the gap between powerful countries and others, the PM struck a positive yet cautious note.He noted the wariness about the consequences which could have not been imagined until very recently, but focused on the enthusiasm with which the youth have approached, what he called, the latest of turning points in history.""Today, the world is divided into two kinds of people: those who see fear in AI and speak only of that fear, and those who see fortune in AI. I say with responsibility and with pride that India does not see fear in AI, India sees fortune in AI. India sees the future in AI,"" Modi said.He acknowledged the task that govts and societies face and said while history has seen many turning points, the transformative change represented by AI is unprecedented in terms of speed and scale.The PM sought to strike a balance between increasingly desperate cries for regulating AI and those saying that curbs could stifle innovation, thus nipping potential breakthroughs, which hold the key to challenges of Alzheimer's, cancer and climate change. ""We must give AI the open sky, but keep the command in our hands. Just like GPS - it suggests the route - but the final decision of direction is ours. The path we choose for AI today will determine the future we create tomorrow,"" he said.On Wednesday, senior White House policy adviser on Artificial Intelligence, Sriram Krishnan, had said that the US wants to make sure that the world uses the American AI stack.Modi said India's perspective on AI is reflected in the theme of the summit - Sarvajan Hitaya, Sarvajan Sukhaya - Welfare for all, Happiness for all' - and that is India's benchmark. He said that the emergence of AI is a turning point for human civilisation and urged global leaders and innovators to ensure that the technology remains human-centric, inclusive and ethically governed.Highlighting the need for setting up of global standards, PM flagged deepfakes and fabricated content that are bringing instability to open societies. Drawing a parallel with nutrition labels on food which make a person aware of what they are eating, the PM said the digital world should have authenticity labels on content so that people know what is real and what is created by AI.""As Artificial Intelligence is creating more text, images and videos, the need for watermarking and clear source standards in the industry is increasing. That's why it's necessary that this trust be built in to technology from the beginning,"" he added.The PM said alongside the present generation, there is a need to consider what form of AI will future generations get. Drawing another parallel with nuclear power, where the world has seen its destructive force, and its positive contributions, Modi said, ""AI, too, is a transformative power - if directionless, it leads to disruption; if guided rightly, it becomes a solution. How to make AI human-centric, sensitive and responsible is the core purpose of AI Impact Summit,"" he added.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi pushed for democratisation of AI, saying it must become a tool for inclusion and empowerment.

'Bulls***t': Macron Slams Social Media's 'Free Speech' Rhetoric, Calls For Algorithm Transparency

Govts must work together for safe Net: Macron

PM Modi and French President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday spoke on the need to shield children from the harms of AI and social media. ""We must become even more vigilant about children's safety. Just as a school syllabus is carefully curated, the AI space too must be child-safe and family-guided,"" Modi said at the India AI Impact Summit.Addressing the summit earlier, Macron expressed hope that India would join France and other countries in banning social media networks for children under 15 years of age, emphasising that protecting children is about not just regulation but civilisation as well. He said there was no reason to expose children to content online that is legally forbidden in the real world.The French leader struck a bullish note on India being part of AI revolution and benefiting from it. Backing India and Europe's AI aspirations, he said India had proved the world wrong after being told a decade ago that 1.4 billion people could not be brought into the digital economy.On a ban on social media networks for children under 15 years of age, Macron said France is embarking on the journey, with several European countries also committed to it.Australia has become the first country to ban social media for children under 16 and, in India, BJP ally TDP has pushed for a regulation along similar lines.""I know, Mr Prime Minister, you will join this club. And this is great news that India will join such an approach to protect children and teenagers,"" he said, referring to Narendra Modi who was in the audience along with other global leaders and tech bigwigs. IT minister Ashwini Vaishnav had on Tuesday said that India was debating the issue of restricting children's access to social media.""Our platforms, govts and regulators should be working together to make the Internet and social media a safe space,"" Macron said.He also emphasised France's shared vision with India to ensure access to AI for everyone at a time when it has become a ""major field of strategic competition"".""Hegemony from any quarter is not a fatality. There is a path for innovation, independence and strategic autonomy. And this path, I'm convinced, is what countries like France and India must take together,"" he said, heaping praise on India for its advances in providing digital access, be it for identity or financial transaction, to its entire population. ""That is not just a tech story. That is a civilisation story,"" he said.""Access to Al for all is critical. France and India share a common vision: a sovereign Al used to protect our planet and to foster prosperity for all."" He said the future of Al will be built by those who combine innovation and responsibility, and technology with humanity. ""India and France will help shape this future together. We are determined to continue to shape the rules of the game. And to do it with our allies because we believe in core shared values.

Visakhapatnam: Defence minister Rajnath Singh urged global powers to confront fast-evolving, intertwined maritime risks through cooperation rooted in respect and reciprocity, as India opened its largest-ever multilateral naval exercise, Exercise MILAN-2026.""When our ships sail together, when our sailors train together, and when our commanders deliberate together, we build a shared understanding that transcends geography and politics,"" he said on Thursday.The defence minister addressed visiting navy chiefs and delegations from nine Asean members at the inaugural ceremony, welcoming participation that has grown from four foreign navies in 1995 to 74 nations this year.Navies now shoulder a broader burden as global commerce surges and competition sharpens around chokepoints and channels, he said. Interest in underwater resources, including rare earth minerals, is rising. Terror networks spanning borders complicate security, while climate change is intensifying disasters and pushing humanitarian missions to the fore. ""No single navy, however capable, can address these challenges alone,"" Singh said.Inviting Asean countries to tap India's expanding defence-industrial base, he said the govt's Aatmanirbhar Bharat push led by PM Narendra Modi has transformed India into a ""builder's navy"". He cited aircraft carrier INS Vikrant and the Visakhapatnam-class destroyers as proof of growing indigenous shipbuilding capacity.Singh traced India's maritime outlook from SAGAR to its expanded vision, MAHASAGAR, signalling wider engagement. He backed United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea as a durable framework and called for stronger global naval architecture. India, he said, will remain a steady ""vishwa mitra"" in the Indo-Pacific.","Rajnath Singh urges global powers to confront fast-evolving, intertwined maritime risks through cooperation rooted in respect and reciprocity.

NEW DELHI: TMC MP Mahua Moitra moved Delhi high court on Thursday, challenging a district court order refusing to grant her shared custody of a pet Rottweiler called Henry. The lawmaker had sought interim custody of Henry for 10 days every month.HC sought the stand of Moitra's former partner and advocate, Jai Anant Dehadrai, on her appeal and asked him to file his response. Dehadrai appeared in person and contended that the petition should be dismissed at this stage itself, arguing that it had no merits. HC listed the case for hearing on April 29.In her appeal, Moitra argued that the district court's decision was ""bad in law and on facts"" as it failed to consider that Henry was given to her as her pet ""to be loved and cared for"" and primarily resided at her residence, except when she was away on constituency duties, during which time the dog stayed with Dehadrai.Dehadrai has argued that the dog was purchased by him in 2021. Moitra contended that owing to her friendship at the time with Dehadrai, she was entitled to joint custody of the pet. Last year, HC had advised the parties to ""sit together"" and sort out the dispute.

NEW DELHI: After days of speculation, Bill Gates did not deliver his scheduled keynote at the AI Impact Summit 2026 , with the Gates Foundation announcing the decision just hours before the address on Thursday.The Foundation had stated a day earlier that the keynote will go ahead as planned. However, Thursday morning, it was announced on X that the Microsoft founder will skip the speech. In a brief statement, the foundation said the decision was taken ""after careful consideration"" to ensure that attention remains on the summit's key priorities.Gates was due to deliver a short but high-profile address on opportunities and risks linked to artificial intelligence. His withdrawal comes amid renewed public discussion around his past association with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein , following release of emails bearing his name in late Jan. In recent weeks, some opposition parties and media commentators in India had questioned whether Gates' presence at the summit was appropriate.Despite the debate, preparations appeared unchanged earlier this week. On Tuesday, the Foundation's India office had posted that Gates would attend the summit and deliver his keynote as scheduled.The Foundation said Ankur Vora, president of its Africa and India offices, would deliver the keynote in Gates' place.

AI Rivals Altman, Amodei Snub Each Other, Turns India AI Impact Summit Photo Op With PM Modi Awkward

NEW DELHI: At the AI Impact Summit on Thursday, there was a ""caught-off-guard moment"" on stage. When PM Narendra Modi invited tech leaders to join him on the dais for a group photo, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, who ended up standing next to each other, stopped short of holding hands.Instead, the two AI rivals stood beside each other with arms crossed - a subtle but noticeable gesture that stood out during the otherwise celebratory moment.The moment when Altman and Amodei chose not to join hands on stage quickly went viral across social media platforms. The optics drew attention at a time when rivalry between OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, and Anthropic, which develops Claude, sharpened. Both companies aggressively competed to position their models as the preferred AI assistant for users globally, intensifying an already high stakes battle for global dominance.Altman later clarified in a media statement, ""I was sort of confused... (PM) Modi grabbed my hand and put it up, and I just wasn't sure what we were supposed to be doing.""While CEOs of other companies joined hands, Amodei and Altman stood uneasily, their elbows touching.Altman and Amodei worked together at OpenAI till 2019. Amodei, his sister, Daniela and a group of researchers, left the company in 2020 due to disagreements with Altman and the board over the company's direction, and subsequently set up Anthropic.Earlier this month, Altman hit out at Anthropic after the latter used a Super Bowl campaign to criticise a potential introduction of advertising within ChatGPT. The ads characterised such a move as a ""betrayal"". The TV ads positioned its own Claude chatbot as permanently ad-free.Altman called this campaign ""dishonest"" and defended his company's strategy of using ads, being different from what Anthropic portrayed. ""We are not stupid and know our users would reject that... I guess it's on brand for Anthropic doublespeak to use a deceptive ad to critique theoretical deceptive ads that aren't real, but a Super Bowl ad is not where I would expect it,"" he had said in a social media post.","OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei did not hold hands.

New Delhi: India on Thursday made a clear pitch - AI must work in many languages, solve real problems, and serve societies beyond a small, privileged group, and got leaders of tech giants to adopt the 'New Delhi Frontier AI Impact Commitments' - a voluntary framework aimed at diffusing the benefits of AI among developing and underdeveloped countries; and the Global South.Unveiled at the AI Impact Summit by IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, the commitments bring together global frontier AI firms and Indian innovators to promote responsible, inclusive, and culturally sensitive AI. The emphasis is on real-world use rather than high-level declarations.The framework outlines two key commitments adopted on the first day of the summit.The first focuses on transparency and data. Participating organisations will publish anonymised and aggregated statistical insights on how AI is being used across sectors such as healthcare, agriculture, education and public services. The aim is to build a clearer picture of AI adoption across economies and regions, helping govts design evidence-based policies on workforce transition, skills and productivity, while also tracking how AI use evolves over time.The second commitment addresses a long-standing gap in AI - language. Most AI systems today perform best in English, with uneven results across other languages and cultural settings. Under the new framework, organisations will work to assess and improve AI performance across a wide range of languages and contexts. This includes collaborating with govts, researchers and civil society to develop datasets, benchmarks and evaluation methods for under-represented languages, particularly those spoken in the Global South.Describing the New Delhi commitments as a key outcome, Vaishnaw said the initiative was designed to link innovation with inclusion.","'New Delhi Frontier AI Impact Commitments' are voluntary framework aimed at diffusing the benefits of AI among developing and underdeveloped countries; and the Global South.

‘Why Only Talk About PoK? What About China?’ J&K CM Slams Centre Over 'Double Standards'

SRINAGAR: Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah said on Thursday that he does not believe in media censorship or using govt advertisements to influence coverage.“I have never asked any media house not to write against me or in my favour. I will never use advertisements as a pressure point,” Omar told the Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly in Jammu during the passage of the finance grants.“I have never called a newspaper to question what it has written about me. I am not among those who use advertisements to exert pressure,” he added.However, Omar said the govt would rationalise advertisement policy to ensure greater transparency. He said advertisement allocation should be based on objective criteria like circulation, readership and reach. “Several members mentioned newspapers that many of us have not even seen. But they receive advertisements. It raises questions about how advertisements are being allocated and who takes those decisions,” he said, adding that circulation and audience reach of newspapers and channels should form the basis for advertisement distribution.On vacancies and employment, Omar said there is a distinction between creation of posts and appointments.“We have filled around 6,000-6,500 posts,” he said, reiterating that govt would work to fill around 30,000 vacant posts this year through transparent and time-bound recruitment processes in coordination with the Service Selection Board and Public Service Commission. He also referred to outsourcing engagements, describing them as additional opportunities, though not counted as formal jobs. “At least they are earning a living,” he added.Stating tat Jammu and Kashmir has financial constraints, Omar said tax and non-tax revenues cover only about 25% of expenditure, while 75% comes through central share and assistance.“This is not a situation created today, it has been inherited,” he said, adding that efforts are underway to improve financial self-reliance.Omar emphasised that climate response is now a compulsion for J&K, especially after the impacts of drought and heavy rains last year. He said a fund for climate change mitigation has been prepared, and stressed the need to assign departmental responsibility for studying and addressing climate change impact before undertaking further budgetary measures.About tourism, he said govt successfully revived the industry despite the difficult circumstances following the tragic Pahalgam terror attack. “Today, Gulmarg hotels are full. Sonamarg hotels are full,” he said, adding that several destinations have been reopened with the intervention of the Centre. He expressed hope that by May all destinations still closed would be reopened.","Omar Abdullah said he does not believe in media censorship or using govt advertisements to influence coverage.

‘Targeting People Like Terrorists’: Mamata Banerjee Attacks EC Over SIR, Cites Bangladesh Polls

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission on Thursday asked 22 states and Union Territories including Delhi to complete preparatory work related to the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) at the earliest as the exercise is ""expected to start from April"".Once the exercise is completed, all states and UTs will be covered.In a letter to the chief electoral officers of Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Chandigarh, Dadra and Nagar Haveli & Daman and Diu, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Ladakh, Maharashtra, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Delhi, Odisha, Punjab, Sikkim, Tripura, Telangana and Uttarakhand, the poll authority said pan-India SIR of voters' list was ordered in June last year.Battling ""vote chori"" allegations levelled by the opposition Congress, the Election Commission held the SIR of electoral rolls in 13 states and UTs and a 'special revision' in Assam this year. It is all set to hold a similar exercise in the remaining 22 states and UTs this year.While the exercise, which kept the EC in the news, was completed in Bihar, it is ongoing in 12 states and UTs with nearly 60 crore electors.The remaining 40 crore electors will be covered in these 17 states and five UTs.In Assam, a 'special revision', instead of SIR, was completed on February 10.Due to a variety of reasons, SIR in the nine states and three UTs have seen frequent tweaking in schedules.Like Bihar, political parties have approached the Supreme Court challenging SIR in Tamil Nadu and West Bengal.Recently, TMC president and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee personally pleaded before a bench of the chief justice of India against the poll roll cleanup exercise in her state.As the EC was preparing for SIR in Bihar, its officials had claimed that several nationals from Bangladesh, Nepal and Myanmar were found by its grassroots level functionaries.But eventually, the poll authority did not share any numbers or proof of such people who were not eligible to be on the voters' list.Opposition parties had dubbed the EC's claims as a ploy to carry out SIR to target electors not aligned to BJP and its allies.","The Election Commission asked 22 states and Union Territories including Delhi to complete preparatory work related to the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) at the earliest.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court of India on Thursday has fixed the schedule for the final hearing in a batch of petitions challenging the constitutionality of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 (CAA), for the week commencing May 5, 2026.The petitioners challenging the CAA Act will be heard on May 5 and for half a day on May 6. The respondent Union government, supporting the legislation, will present its arguments during the remaining half of May 6 and continue on May 7.The pleas challenge the law on the ground that it applies to individuals from six specified religious minorities - Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian, while excluding other allegedly persecuted minorities such as the Rohingyas in Bangladesh and Ahmadiyyas in Pakistan.The Bench also indicated that separate hearings concerning issues specific to Assam and Tripura will be taken up immediately after the conclusion of arguments in the main batch of cases. The overall hearing is expected to conclude by May 12.""We have granted liberty to place on record any material and other documents on the Written Submissions, if any, within four weeks. However, there shall be no (new) Writ Petition on the written submissions already placed on record,"" the Court said.The Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, seeks to fast-track Indian citizenship for members of the six specified minority communities from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan who entered India on or before December 31, 2014, citing religious persecution in those countries.The Act was; notified on December 12, 2019, and came into force on January 10, 2020.The Supreme Court, in its March 19, 2024, order, declined an immediate stay on the CAA Rules. Petitioners argued for an immediate freeze, fearing that if citizenship were granted during the litigation, the process would be ""irreversible."" Conversely, the Solicitor General requested a four-week window to file a formal response.During the proceedings, the Court took note of the petitioners' concerns but set a strict timeline for written submissions, limiting both petitioners and the Union to five-page summaries to expedite the hearing.","Supreme Court to begin final hearing of pleas challenging legality of CAA from May 5.

VIJAYAWADA: Amid the ongoing political slugfest between the TDP-led NDA alliance and the YSRCP over the supply of ghee by Maharashtra-based Indapur Dairy to the Tirupati trust, TTD chairman B R Naidu clarified that the Karnataka Milk Federation (KMF) remained TTD’s largest ghee supplier, meeting 62% of the trust’s total requirement. He dismissed the YSRCP’s allegations that Indapur Dairy bags contracts only when the TDP comes to power in the state.B R Naidu released ghee procurement data for 2024–25 to substantiate his claims.According to the TTD chief, following a series of complaints and concerns expressed by millions of devotees of Lord Venkateswara across the globe over the deteriorating quality of the sacred Tirupati laddu — allegedly due to the procurement of adulterated ghee during the erstwhile YSRCP regime — the newly constituted TTD trust board passed a series of resolutions to procure pure cow ghee from reputed dairies across the country in a transparent manner, strictly adhering to FSSAI specifications.“Ever since the revised ghee procurement guidelines came into effect, seven rounds of tenders were called for ghee procurement. Seven reputed national dairies — including KMF, Mother Dairy, Indapur Dairy, Sangam Dairy, Premier Agri Foods, Kolhapur Dairy and Govind Milk — participated in the tender process,” B R Naidu said.“While KMF bagged four out of the seven tenders to supply 60 lakh kg of ghee, the KMF management expressed difficulties and agreed to supply only 10 lakh kg out of the 20 lakh kg tender quantity in the tender floated in October last year.Overall, KMF supplied 50 lakh kg of ghee, accounting for 62% of the total ghee procured by TTD between 2024 and 2025,” the TTD chief noted.B R Naidu further clarified that Indapur Dairy qualified in only two of the seven tenders floated by TTD and secured orders to supply 10 lakh kg of ghee. Dismissing allegations that Indapur Dairy participates in TTD ghee supply tenders only during the TDP regime, he said the dairy took part in the tender process about six times between 2019 and 2024 during the YSRCP regime.Rejecting allegations of an abnormal spike in ghee prices procured by the Tirupati trust, the TTD chairman underlined that ghee prices fluctuate based on multiple parameters. He asserted that the rates at which TTD procured ghee from national dairies were in line with the indicative prices of the National Cooperative Dairy Federation of India (NCDFI) and the Indian Dairy Association (IDA).",B R Naidu released ghee procurement data for 2024–25 to substantiate his claims.

Artificial intelligence is forcing a structural rethink of India’s technology growth model, with HCL Technologies chairperson Roshni Nadar Malhotra on Thursday calling for a decisive transition from services-led expansion to intellectual property creation to remain globally competitive.Addressing the AI Impact Summit 2026, Malhotra said the next phase of economic value creation will depend on ownership of platforms, products and models rather than scale-driven delivery services that defined India’s IT rise over decades, PTI reported.""India must move from being a tech services-led nation to an IP-led nation; services scale with effort. IP scales infinitely,"" she said.She noted that companies deploying technology alone would struggle to capture long-term value as artificial intelligence restructures global business economics. ""In the AI economy, value accrues to those who build and own platforms, models and products, not just those who deploy them. That shift is not only economic, it is transformative,"" she added.Malhotra said AI presents a dual impact -- lowering operational costs through automation while simultaneously opening new markets and opportunities - making strategic repositioning essential for both companies and nations.Outlining priorities for India, she said leadership in the AI economy would require three shifts: moving from scale to IP creation, transitioning from adoption to innovation, and building a national AI infrastructure capable of democratising access to computing power.""Compute can unlock innovation across startups, universities, enterprises and institutions. When compute is accessible, innovation decentralizes. When innovation decentralizes, IP multiplies. That is how an IP nation is built -- not by one champion, but by an ecosystem but ambition without purpose is incomplete,"" she said.Describing AI as a broader leadership moment rather than merely a technological transition, Malhotra said every industrial revolution reshapes human roles, and artificial intelligence raises questions about what responsibilities should remain uniquely human as machines increasingly handle analytical and predictive tasks.She added that HCL Tech is itself adapting to this transformation by moving away from a traditional people-centric delivery framework towards a combined system of software products, intelligent agents and human expertise.""We are evolving from a people-centric delivery model to an integrated system of software products, intelligent agents and human expertise, delivering outcomes at scale. This is more than just a business shift. It reflects a broader national ambition to build intellectual property that creates enduring, compounding value,"" the chairperson said.Highlighting governance risks, Malhotra warned that unchecked technological acceleration could erode trust, stressing that AI must develop alongside responsible oversight.She compared AI’s disruptive impact to a power hitter in T20 cricket, saying outcomes depend on how strategically leaders respond to change.""AI will define this decade, but what the world would remember for centuries is the leadership who shaped it responsibly, wisely and with clarity,"" she added.",HCL Technologies chairperson Roshni Nadar Malhotra called for a decisive transition from services-led expansion to intellectual property creation to remain globally competitive. She said companies deploying technology alone would struggle to capture long-term value as artificial intelligence restructures global business economics.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128564640,imgsize-937821,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

Gulf Power Shift? MBZ 'SNUBS' MBS; UAE Firms Pull Back From Saudi World Defence Show

Why it matters

Higher geopolitical risk premiums for Gulf-linked investments and trade corridors.

More intense proxy competition in fragile states where both already back opposing factions.

A chill on cross-border business between two countries that have tried to sell themselves as safe, frictionless hubs for global capital.

The big picture

Their Yemen priorities diverged around 2018.

OPEC tensions over production quotas flared in 2021.

A broader economic rivalry intensified as Saudi Arabia tried to build a Dubai-like hub at home.

figure in the Saudi-UAE rivalry

What’s next





Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, the Gulf’s two most influential petro-powers, are sliding from strategic partnership into open rivalry - a shift that’s already reshaping the Yemen war, injecting new risk into cross-border commerce, and rippling across flashpoints from Sudan to the Horn of Africa.The fallout is no longer subtle. Where officials once papered over differences with “brotherly” rhetoric, the dispute has curdled into a public narrative war, bureaucratic friction for companies, and intensified proxy competition abroad.“This isn’t a tactical disagreement,” HA Hellyer, a senior associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, told the NYT. “It’s a strategic split over what stability means in the Middle East.”This rift is more than Gulf gossip. It’s a direct challenge to the region’s most important political and economic assumptions: that Riyadh and Abu Dhabi - however competitive - ultimately coordinate on security, energy and the big foreign-policy calls.That assumption underpins everything from investor confidence to war management in Yemen to the cohesion of the Gulf Cooperation Council and the stability of OPEC decision-making.If the rivalry deepens, the consequences could include:Diplomats and executives are increasingly nervous about “what comes next,” as the Economist put it, with some privately drawing parallels to the 2017 Qatar crisis - even if a full embargo remains unlikely.Saudi Arabia and the UAE have been aligned for decades. They are central members of the GCC and the oil producers’ cartel, and they fought together in Yemen against the Houthis after 2015.Their economic ties are deep: the Economist notes the UAE is Saudi Arabia’s fifth-largest export market for goods, while Saudi Arabia ranks ninth for the UAE, with bilateral trade around $31 billion annually. The Dubai-Riyadh route is among the world’s busiest international air corridors.But even when the partnership looked solid, cracks were visible:Foreign affairs argues that the rivalry’s economic engine is Saudi Vision 2030: Riyadh’s drive to attract capital, tourism, headquarters and talent at a scale that inevitably competes with the UAE’s established role as the Gulf’s commercial center. The contest isn’t just geopolitical - it’s a bid for primacy in finance, logistics, tech, tourism and influence.Neither side publicly frames it that way. But the incentives are hard to miss: a Saudi rise in non-oil sectors risks coming “at the cost of Emirati dominance,” as Foreign Affairs puts it, especially if global markets can’t sustain both at the same scale simultaneously.The current rupture burst into the open through Yemen, where Riyadh and Abu Dhabi once shared a military mission but increasingly backed different local power centers.According to the Economist, the relationship hit a new low in December when Saudi Arabia bombed an Emirati weapons shipment and accused the UAE of threatening its national security - despite describing the UAE as “shaqiqa” (“brotherly”) multiple times in an unusually strained diplomatic statement.The NYT reports that a UAE-backed separatist group launched an offensive in December to seize control of Yemen’s south - an area along key global trade routes - and Saudi officials responded by pushing back “forcefully,” declaring the kingdom would take responsibility for Yemen’s future.Reuters adds the most revealing detail: Riyadh is now trying to consolidate the anti-Houthi coalition by deploying political leverage and significant funds - in effect, replacing the Emirati role and asserting itself as the dominant external patron.“Saudi Arabia has cooperated with us and expressed its readiness to pay all salaries in full,” Yemeni Information Minister Muammar Eryani told Reuters.Reuters reports Saudi Arabia is budgeting nearly $3 billion this year for Yemeni salaries and stabilization, including roughly $1 billion earmarked for payments previously handled by Abu Dhabi - a major recurring commitment, especially as Riyadh faces budget pressures and expensive domestic mega-projects.Yasmine Farouk of the International Crisis Group captured the new dynamic bluntly: Saudi Arabia is prioritizing Yemen because “it is now the sole owner of this problem,” per Reuters.That “sole owner” posture is both strategic and reputational: Saudi Arabia wants a coherent anti-Houthi front, fewer rival command structures, and a stable border environment that doesn’t threaten Vision 2030 or investor confidence at home.In the Gulf, policy disputes are often inseparable from leadership dynamics and status. Here, that’s central.Saudi Arabia, under its Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, sees itself as first among equals: it has Islam’s holiest sites, the largest GCC citizen population, and G20 weight. The Economist says a commentator close to the Saudi royal court recently described the UAE as a rebellious “younger sibling.”That framing infuriates Emiratis, who view their more diversified economy and militarily capable state as proof they no longer need to follow Riyadh’s lead. The NYT reports UAE elites grumble that Saudi Arabia is behaving like a domineering “big brother.”The widening gap shows up across multiple files:* Sudan: A sharp divergence after Sudan’s civil war erupted. Riyadh backed Sudan’s army; the UAE allegedly supported the Rapid Support Forces. The Economist notes the UAE acknowledges providing some early support but denies it continues.* Somalia/Horn of Africa: The Horn is a likely arena for further escalation, with Saudi and Emirati ties pulling in opposite directions and raising the risk of destabilization.* Syria: The Economist notes Saudi anxiety over Syria, where the UAE remains skeptical of Ahmed al-Sharaa, the ex-jihadist leader who took power after the Assad regime collapsed in 2024.* Israel and political Islam: The UAE normalized ties with Israel in 2020 and sees political Islam as an existential threat; Saudi Arabia has been more pragmatic - willing to tolerate some Islamist actors while prioritizing stability.These aren’t isolated disagreements - they reflect fundamentally different theories of order. Foreign Affairs says Saudi Arabia increasingly prioritizes predictability and calm to attract investment, while the UAE remains driven by preventing Islamists from gaining ground and by leveraging assertive interventionism.One reason this rift matters globally: it hits the Gulf’s attempt to market itself as a stable magnet for capital.Bloomberg reports businesses are watching tensions closely, with firms quietly contingency-planning in case frictions intensify. Some UAE-based firms report problems securing Saudi business visas, according to people familiar with the matter, though a Saudi official told Bloomberg: “There’s no change regarding visa regulations and procedures for people residing in the United Arab Emirates, and the number of issued visas didn’t change. ”Even without formal measures, the perception of informal obstacles can be enough to rattle decision-making - especially when Saudi Arabia is simultaneously pushing a “regional headquarters” policy designed to pull multinational offices from Dubai to Riyadh.At stake, Bloomberg notes, is roughly $22 billion in trade between the two largest Gulf economies - and broader confidence as both pitch themselves as global finance hubs backed by sovereign wealth funds with trillions under management.The Wall Street Journal ties the feud to a visible Saudi media shift: more aggressively anti-Israel rhetoric that also attacks the UAE’s alignment with Israel under the Abraham Accords.A Saudi editorial in Al Riyadh declared: “Wherever Israel is present, there is ruin and destruction,” per the WSJ, while a cleric at Mecca’s Grand Mosque said: “Oh God, deal with the Jews who have seized and occupied, for they cannot escape your power,” in a sermon cited by the WSJ.The WSJ reports Saudi columnist Ahmed bin Othman Al-Tuwaijri wrote: “The impostor from Abu Dhabi believes that the shortest path to avenging past grudges and healing the state of jealousy and feelings of inferiority toward the Kingdom is by throwing oneself into the arms of Zionism and accepting that the Emirates become the Israeli Trojan horse in the Arab world.”The politics are delicate. Saudi Arabia’s embassy in Washington told the WSJ the kingdom rejects antisemitism and remains open to normalization with Israel if there is a commitment to Palestinian statehood. But the public temperature matters: it shapes what normalization looks like - and whether it’s even feasible.The Saudi-UAE split is no longer confined to the Gulf: It is increasingly entangled with India and Pakistan.Foreign Policy reports that the region is crystallizing into two loose camps, with the UAE and Israel at the center of what it calls an “Abrahamic” alignment that extends outward to include India. That bloc, the magazine argues, seeks to “reconfigure the region through military power, technological collaboration, and economic integration,” leveraging frameworks such as I2U2 and the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor.On the other side, Foreign Policy describes an emerging counterweight led by Saudi Arabia, alongside Turkey and Pakistan - an “Islamic coalition” oriented toward sovereignty and counterbalancing what it views as destabilizing interventionism.That dynamic has become more explicit in recent months.Saudi Arabia and Pakistan signed a Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement in September 2025. The agreement signaled that Saudi Arabia was deepening military ties eastward at the very moment its trust in Abu Dhabi was eroding.Meanwhile, as news spread of a potential Saudi-Turkey-Pakistan security alignment, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed made a high-profile visit to India, signaling Abu Dhabi’s intent to fortify its own strategic footprint with New Delhi.Foreign Policy frames India as giving the UAE-Israel axis “strategic depth that extends well beyond the Middle East itself,” particularly through technology and logistics integration. That matters because India is both a rising economic power and a maritime actor with growing stakes in the Red Sea and Gulf shipping corridors - the same arteries affected by Saudi-Emirati competition in Yemen and the Horn of Africa.Pakistan, by contrast, occupies a different role. It is a long-standing Saudi security partner, and its inclusion in a more formal Saudi-led defense framework sends a message: Riyadh is building external security buffers independent of Abu Dhabi’s network.The immediate question is whether mediation can halt the slide.The Economist reports Qatar has tried to mediate - an ironic twist given the UAE and Saudi Arabia once helped blockade Qatar - while Bahrain, Egypt and Turkey are also working diplomatic angles.President Donald Trump, never shy about his deal-making brand, said: “I can settle it very easily,” on February 16, per the Economist. Yet diplomats quoted there suggest the administration is wary of wading into a dispute between two allies whose ties to Trump-world business networks create extra sensitivity.In the near term, three scenarios look most plausible:1. Managed rivalry, quiet reset: Backchannel diplomacy cools rhetoric, and the two sides compartmentalize disputes - especially to reassure investors.2. Proxy escalation: Sudan, Somalia and the Horn become sharper arenas for competition, raising conflict intensity and humanitarian risks.3. Economic “frictionization”: Not a blockade, but more regulatory pressure, slower visas, customs delays and competing rules - enough to reshape how multinationals structure Gulf operations.Mohammed Baharoon, head of a Dubai research center, told the NYT that ambiguity is what makes this rift dangerous: “In this case, there is no list of demands.” That absence of an off-ramp increases the risk of miscalculation.(With inputs from agencies)","Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are sliding from strategic partnership into open rivalry.

LUCKNOW: Rejecting allegations of large‑scale voter deletions across Uttar Pradesh, chief electoral officer (CEO) Navdeep Rinwa on Wednesday said that only 4,336 names have been removed from the draft electoral roll on the basis of Form‑7 applications filed by third parties that is, applications submitted by an individual seeking deletion of another person’s name — during the claims and objections window under the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) 2026.Addressing what he termed misinformation around deletions, Rinwa presented a granular breakdown of Form‑7 inflows and outcomes. Between Jan 6 and Feb 17, 2026, election authorities received 1.40 lak Form‑7 applications -- 55,752 from women, 84,667 from men and six from the third gender.Looking at the longer window from the SIR‑2026 announcement on Oct 27, 2025, to Feb 17, 2026, total Form‑7 receipts stood at 1.89 lakh (including 76,866 women, 1.12 lakh men, and eight third gender applicants).Drilling down further, Rinwa said that from Jan 6 to Feb 16, there were 1.35 lakh Form‑7 applications, of which 70,865 were self‑filed by voters regarding their own entries; 16,863 were auto‑generated after a voter initiated a transfer request via Form‑8; and only 47,684 were filed by another person requesting deletion of someone else’s name and less than 10% of these were deleted.“Against a total of 12.55 crore voters during the claims and objections period (Jan 6–Feb 16), only 23,935 names have been deleted so far,” he said.Of these, 14,388 deletions are consequent to Form‑8 transfers, 5,211 followed the outcome of a voter’s own transfer request, and just 4,336 resulted from third‑party Form‑7 applications underscoring that external deletion requests form a small fraction of overall actions.The CEO also outlined progress on notices and additions. Following publication of the draft rolls on Jan 6, 2026, notices were issued to voters flagged for no mapping (where a voter’s record is not linked properly) and for logical discrepancies.In total, 3.26 crore notices were to be issued -- 1.04 crore for no mapping and 2.22 crore for logical discrepancies. Of these, 3.25 crore notices have been generated, with over 1.85 crore served by Booth Level Officers (BLOs) and about 1.15 crore hearings completed by notified officers as of Feb 18. Hearing throughput has accelerated steadily, with more than 35 lakh hearings conducted in the last three days of the reported period, Rinwa added, expressing confidence that the exercise would be completed within schedule.On new additions to the rolls, Rinwa said that 54.4 lakh Form‑6 applications were received between Jan 6 and Feb 17, 2026—27 -- 20 lakh from women, 27.19 lakh from men, and 222 from the third gender. This includes 36.76 lakh applications from voters aged 18–29. Counting from the SIR‑2026 announcement (Oct 27, 2025) to Feb 17, 2026, authorities have received over 70 lakh Form‑6 applications.To bolster the field capacity, the number of electoral registration officers (EROs) and assistant EROs has been expanded from 403 and 2,042 at the start of SIR‑2026 to a combined 13,161. Hearing centres rose from 3,984 to 4,635 (as of February 9), with instructions for notified officers to hold on‑site hearings at polling stations to minimise voter travel.","Chief electoral officer (CEO) Navdeep Rinwa rejects allegations of large‑scale voter deletions across Uttar Pradesh.

Kolkata: Lab Blast Injures Students, Water Safety & Crime Worries





KOLKATA: The city recorded its highest surge in vehicle registrations in 2025, taking the total registered vehicle count to 23,66,267. The new figures underscore an accelerating shift towards private mobility in the metropolis.The city’s 2025 registration figure — 1,09,807 — surpassed the previous record set in 2024.While the trend signals positive momentum for trade and overall economic activity, it also deepens urban challenges. Rising vehicle numbers exacerbate congestion, increase emissions, lengthen travel time and contribute to a worrying decline in public transport usage, said transport expert Bhargav Maitra of IIT Kharagpur.Data from the city’s four regional transport offices (RTOs) reveal that three zones recorded robust growth in registrations in 2025, while one posted a marginal year-on-year decline. The surge was driven primarily by personalised modes of transportation — two-wheelers and private cars — reflecting post-pandemic travel behaviour, the expansion of suburbanisation and easier access to vehicle financing.The public vehicles department (PVD) in Beltala, the core RTO of the city, leads in terms of number of registrations.It registered 44,455 vehicles in 2025, a 16% increase over 38,319 in 2024.The cumulative registrations at the RTO reached 9,83,823 vehicles to date. After a slight dip in 2023, growth remained firmly positive for two consecutive years.Behala RTO stood out with the highest growth rate among all zones. It registered 14,962 vehicles in 2025, a robust 17.3% increase over the previous year, when 12,755 vehicles were registered. The zone witnessed a rapid recovery since 2023 and recorded a sharp jump of 36% since 2024.Total registrations in Behala RTO now stand at 3,21,537.Salt Lake RTO also reported a healthy growth, with 27,588 vehicles registered in 2025, marking an 8.4% rise from 25,453 in 2024. With total registrations crossing 5,66,137, Salt Lake continued its steady upward trajectory, building on consistent gains since 2023.Kasba was the only RTO to register a contraction in 2025. Registrations fell marginally to 22,802, a 1.52% decline from 23,154 in 2024. Despite the dip, long-term data indicates gradual expansion, with cumulative registrations touching 4,94,740 vehicles, said a transport department official.Personal vehicles dominate the trend. Officials attribute the overall rise to increasing demand for two-wheelers for daily commuting and compact cars for family use. Rising income levels, improved road connectivity in peripheral areas, and reduced confidence in overcrowded public transport accelerated this shift.With early 2026 figures already showing fresh additions across all RTOs, transport officials expect vehicle registrations in Kolkata to remain on a growth path, even as policymakers grapple with challenges related to congestion, parking, and urban emissions.","The city’s 2025 registration figure — 1,09,807 — surpassed the previous record set in 2024.

Sunil Mittal , founder and chairman of Bharti Enterprises, said AI is already becoming central to telecom operations. “From our company’s standpoint, AI is becoming a really integral part of how we operate, serve customers, and build our networks,” he said, adding that sectors such as healthcare, education, and medical sciences “will flourish on the back of this.”Shantanu Narayen, chairman and CEO of Adobe, said India is likely to see one of the world’s largest AI user bases. “Given that the number of people using AI in India will be greater than anywhere else in the world in a few years, the leadership role India can play—not just in what these models mean, but in how we think about data, privacy, security, and trust—is significant,” he said.A key concern, Narayen added, is authenticity in the age of generative AI. “I want every piece of information that’s produced to carry provenance and a watermark so that people can clearly distinguish what is real from what is fake,” he said, referring to safeguards around synthetic content.On open standards, Mittal questioned whether leading AI developers might keep systems tightly controlled. Narayen acknowledged “the inevitable tension between commercial enterprises that want to keep information proprietary and the need to do good for humanity,” calling it an ongoing challenge.He argued that long-term advantage would not lie solely in owning models. “Sustainable advantage, over time, cannot rest only on the model. It has to be in the use cases—what people are actually doing with that model,” he said, citing Adobe’s support for open standards such as PDF.Expressing confidence in India’s trajectory, Narayen said he was “far more confident about what will happen in India” than in many other parts of the world, pointing to the country’s scale, connectivity, and frugal innovation mindset.","AI must remain open, trusted, and globally accessible rather than concentrated in a few hands, industry leaders said at the India AI Impact Summit.
