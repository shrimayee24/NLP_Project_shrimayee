Single dose of Covid-19 vaccine sufficient for already infected people: Study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/single-dose-of-covid-19-vaccine-sufficient-for-already-infected-people-study/articleshow/83513073.cms,"HYDERABAD: A single dose of Covid-19 vaccine is sufficient for an infected person as there was a greater antibody response when compared with those who have had no prior infection, according to a study released by AIG Hospitals on Monday.The city-based AIG Hospitals recently published a study conducted on 260 healthcare workers, who got vaccinated between January 16 and February 5, in the International Journal of Infectious Diseases (a peer-reviewed journal).The study was designed to assess the immunological memory response in all those patients.All patients were given the Covishield vaccine.The study also said Memory T-cell responses elicited by a single dose of vaccine were significantly higher in the previously infected group compared with those who had no prior infection.Commenting on the impact that this study can have on the overall vaccine administration strategy, Dr. D Nageshwar Reddy , Chairman, AIG Hospitals, and one of the co-authors of the study, said the results show that people who got infected with Covid-19 need not take two doses of vaccine as a single dose can develop robust antibody and memory cell response at par with two-doses for those who didnt get the infection.This will significantly help at a time when theres a shortage of vaccine in the country and more people can be covered using the saved doses, Dr Reddy said.Once the requisite number of people are vaccinated for achieving herd immunity, these patients who got infected and received only one dose can take the second dose of the vaccine, he further said.At this point, all our strategies should be directed at the widespread distribution of available vaccines and to include the maximum number of people at least with a single dose, Dr Reddy added.",There was a greater antibody response when compared with those who have had no prior infection. Memory T-cell responses elicited by a single dose of vaccine were significantly higher in the previously infected group.

"Bihar polls: My age may be young, but my promise is mature, says Tejashwi Yadav",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-polls-my-age-may-be-young-but-my-promise-is-mature-says-tejashwi-yadav/articleshow/125009260.cms,"Tejashwi Yadav (ANI)

As the Bihar assembly election campaign intensifies, INDIA bloc’s chief ministerial candidate, Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, lays out his vision for development, employment and economic justice while taking aim at his political rivals.

He shares his plans to create jobs, strengthen the economy and build an inclusive Bihar with TOI’s AlokKNMishra. Excerpts:

You are the chief ministerial candidate of the INDIA bloc and have been campaigning extensively across Bihar for the past several weeks. What promises are you making to people, and what feedback are you getting?

“My Age May Be Young, But My Promise Is Mature,” Says Tejashwi Yadav Ahead of Bihar Polls

You have pledged to provide a govt job for every family. Critics argue that this may not be financially feasible for Bihar, which does not have the financial resources to fund this. How do you plan to implement this promise?

Have you consulted experts, carried out any study or prepared a blueprint for this?

The INDIA bloc and the NDA are both contesting the election on the development plank. How is the RJD-led alliance’s development plank different from the NDA's?

Having served as deputy chief minister under Nitish Kumar, what do you think about Nitish Kumar's style of leadership and the way he runs the Government?

RJD has traditionally relied on support from the Muslim-Yadav vote base. This time, you have fielded more candidates from women, Dalits, and EBC communities. How is the RJD attempting to broaden its appeal beyond the MuslimYadav combination?

The voting patterns in recent Bihar elections indicate that a larger share of EBC, upper-caste and several groups within the Dalit community voters have favoured the NDA over the RJD

Women in Bihar have traditionally been seen as strong supporters of Nitish Kumar. What strategies is the RJD adopting to attract more women voters in this election?

Do you think the women of Bihar are going to support the INDIA bloc this time?

The NDA is contesting the election under the leadership of Nitish Kumar, but it has not yet categorically announced that Nitish will be the CM if the NDA wins. What is your view on this?

Why will the NDA not make Nitish Kumar the CM?

RJD rule in Bihar ended 20 years ago. Even now, many people say that a return of the RJD to power could bring back the ‘jungle raj’ of the past. Why do such perceptions persist even after so many years since the RJD last governed Bihar?

You have been saying that Lalu Yadav gave social justice to the people of Bihar, and you will deliver economic justice. Can you elaborate?

There have been reports of internal differences within the INDIA bloc. How have you addressed or managed these challenges?

But across 11 se

ats, the INDIA bloc partners are contesting against each other in what is being described as a friendly fight.

Congress is an important partner of the RJD-led alliance in Bihar. It won 19 seats in 2020. How do you feel it is going to perform in this election?

Did you give any suggestions to Congress when they were finalising the tickets?

There seems to be tension in your family, with your elder brother’s newly formed party (Janshakti Janata Dal) contesting the election against many RJD candidates. As his younger brother, many would expect him to support you and stand shoulder to shoulder with you in this crucial time. How do you respond to this?

Is there any possibility of the RJD again aligning with Nitish Kumar’s party JD(U) in future?

How challenging is Prashant Kishor’s Jan Suraaj for the INDIA bloc?

You are the INDIA bloc’s CM face. The VIP (Vikassheel Insaan Party) chief is the deputy chief minister face. Is there a possibility that there could be another deputy CM from the Muslim community?

We have taken an oath to make Bihar the number one state in the country and that is our ultimate objective. Our vision is to build a Bihar where no Bihari brother or sister has to migrate in search of work or opportunities. Every facility and opportunity should be available right here, in our own state. Bihar should have factories and job opportunities, as well as quality hospitals, colleges and universities.Factories should be set up, jute mills reopened, food processing units established and new IT parks and SEZs developed.Our goal is to make Bihar an educational hub so that students do not have to go to places like Kota to prepare for exams and we want to build good hospitals so that people do not have to travel outside the state for treatment. Bihar today is one of the poorest states with the lowest per capita income. We are determined to change that by ensuring that every citizen has access to education, healthcare, income, opportunities and justice – and that the govt is truly action-oriented.Bihar also has immense potential in the tourism sector – whether it is religious tourism, heritage tourism or general tourism. We want to develop this potential and promote Bihar as a major tourism destination. We want to make such a Bihar that moves ahead on the path of progress. We are getting a great response from the people who want a change in Bihar.Let the people say what they want to say. The last time, they were saying that giving 10 lakh jobs was impossible. Now, the same people – the BJP and JD(U) – have been forced to talk about jobs, and they are saying they will give one crore jobs. We have done and shown what we promised.We gave five lakh jobs – about 3.5 lakh every year during the 17 months from Aug 2022 to Jan 2024, when I served as deputy chief minister in the Grand Alliance govt. We also gave the status of Bihar govt employees to over four lakh contractual teachers in the state in Dec 2023. So, we have already done it, and soon we will turn this task – which looks impossible – into a possible one. My age may be young, but my promise is mature.We do not make any announcements without consulting the experts and without conducting the required research and study. We only make announcements that are feasible and practical. We have prepared the blueprint for it.The NDA has no development plank and no vision for Bihar. The BJP wants factories to be set up only in Gujarat – the semiconductor factory is in Gujarat, investor meetings are held there, SEZs are established there, and even the international stadium is built there.Everything is being done in Gujarat, while nothing is being done for Bihar. They have no road map or vision for Bihar. Amit Shah (union home minister) himself said that there is a dearth of land in Bihar, which is why factories and industries cannot be set up here. So, they have made it clear that they have no development plan for Bihar.At present, Nitish Kumar has been reduced to just a puppet. BJP is running the govt while Nitish Kumar is merely a figurehead – the real power lies with Narendra Modi and Amit Shah. We even have sympathy for Nitish Kumar, considering his current condition.This is the same Nitish Kumar who once snapped ties with the NDA after Narendra Modi was announced the chief of the BJP’s campaign committee for the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. He had even cancelled a dinner planned for Modi in Patna. In the past, the same Nitish Kumar returned the Rs 5 crore Koshi flood relief donation from the Narendra Modi-led Gujarat govt in 2010 when the Gujarat govt issued advertisements for it.And now, Nitish ji has, unfortunately, become a puppet and his health condition also does not allow him to run the govt effectivelyThe RJD has always been a party for everyone – inclusive since the very beginning. No govt has given as much representation in the state cabinet to upper castes as the one led by Laluji. Similarly, no other govt has matched the number of leaders from the EBC category who were made MLAs, MLCs, and given various opportunities under the govt of Laluji.It was Laluji who made Bhagwati Devi, the daughter of the Musahar community, an MP. He ensured that every section of society received respect and representation in governance. Yes, some people may have left us at times, but eventually, all of them have come back — because they know that the RJD truly belongs to everyone.In the 2020 election, the difference between the NDA and the Mahagathbandhan was only 12,000 votes, which was less than 1%. It shows that we got votes from all sections of society.The women have woken up now. The truth has come out in the open – that women were often exploited and were denied the respect and rights they truly deserved. This is why there is a growing sense of dissatisfaction among women with the Nitish govt.See, due to growing dissatisfaction among women, the Nitish govt had to give a Rs 10,000 bribe to each woman just before the elections. They realised that their support base among women was drifting away, especially after we announced the ‘Mai Bahin Maan Yojana’ for the women of Bihar, under which women in Bihar will receive Rs 2,500 per month as financial assistance to make them financially independent, and we spoke about making Jeevika Didis permanent.This has clearly panicked the NDA. That is why they are giving out Rs 10,000 in the middle of the election, and yet the Election Commission is not stopping them. What is the emergency that justifies this?Amit Shah ji and the BJP are clear that Nitish Kumar will not become the chief minister again. It is totally clear. He will meet the same fate as Shinde ji (Eknath Shinde was not reinstated as CM after the BJP won a majority in the 2024 Maharashtra assembly elections).His situation is not the same. The BJP wants to have its own chief minister in Bihar because, until now, they have never had one. They aspire for it, but that ambition will never be fulfilled.See, this is nothing but complete propaganda and a wrong perception fuelled by those opposed to the RJD. Lalu ji always gave respect to everyone and worked to ensure equality in society. Those who considered themselves superior by birth had to sit at the same level as Dalits and backward communities. This created resentment among such people. True superiority comes from one’s actions, not from birth. Lalu ji made everyone equal and upheld this principle consistently.We are living in an economic age, and people deserve economic justice. Inflation is soaring, jobs are scarce, and household expenses are rising rapidly. How are people supposed to manage their daily lives? Since Modi came to power, under the NDA govt, everything has become more expensive.Modi ji had promised to bring down inflation, but prices have risen fivefold since he took office – fuel, food, and almost everything has become costlier, while people’s incomes remain stagnant. Small and medium-scale factories are shutting down, businesses are struggling and the economy is not growing as it should. The situation worsened further after Trump imposed tariffs. Now is the time to ensure true economic justice for the people.There were no fissures in the INDIA bloc. There was no problem. It was only in the media.The friendly fight is being conducted strategically. In Jharkhand, we contested and won elections despite similar arrangements. Likewise, in Jammu & Kashmir, the INDIA bloc had friendly fights, and they emerged victorious. In Bihar, the situation is no different. We remain united and strong, contesting the elections with our full strength, and we are going to win the elections.Congress will perform much better this time. We are confident of winning more seats compared to 2020, as we have focused carefully on the winnability factor and meticulously selected our candidates.We all sit together and discuss it – the selection of candidates.That’s alright. In a democracy, everyone has the right to form their own party and contest elections. Yes, it would have been far better if the things that happened had not happened, but this is the reality, and we have to accept it.Now, the Janata Dal (United) will not survive after the elections are over. Half of the JD(U) leaders will go to the BJP and half will come to the RJD.We do not care about such things – who is coming to Bihar, who is making what party. Our only focus is to make Bihar the number one state in the country. Our fight is against unemployment.It has already been announced that there will be one more deputy CM if the INDIA bloc forms the govt. When the right time comes, the decision about it will be taken collectively by the alliance partners and an announcement will be made.","Tejashwi Prasad Yadav is the chief ministerial candidate of the INDIA bloc.

According to sources, the Reliance Centre, Ambani's office at Hotel Ranjit in Delhi, is among several properties attached by ED in lieu of alleged diversion of bank funds of more than 20,000 crore.According to sources, the Reliance Centre, Ambani's office at Hotel Ranjit in the heart of Delhi - spread over more than three acres at Maharaja Ranjit Singh Marg, located between Ramlila Ground and Ranjit Singh flyover - is among the several properties attached by the central agency in lieu of alleged diversion of bank funds to the tune of more than 20,000 crore.Sources said ED in its attachment order has alleged that Ambani group entities indulged in diversion of bank funds, which were further lent to shell companies and wholly owned subsidiaries of the group with an intention to siphon off the proceeds. ""Substantial portions of corporate loans ultimately landed in accounts of Reliance group companies,"" sources said, hinting at round-tripping of the laundered funds.More attachments are likely to follow in the weeks ahead.Since July, ED has carried out multiple searches on Ambani, his associates and group entities, including at his Mumbai residence. He was also summoned and questioned at ED's headquarters in Delhi on Aug 5.ED's investigation under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act is based on two FIRs registered by CBI against Ambani and his entities for alleged bank loan frauds.

"$800,000 shortcut: Wealthy Indians buying their way past H-1B hurdles",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/800000-shortcut-wealthy-indians-buying-their-way-past-h-1b-hurdles/articleshow/125044009.cms,"Indian Workers Face New Challenge as US Tightens Work Visa Rules Amid Crackdown on H-1B Abuse

Gold Card versus EB-5



EB-5's rising momentum



MUMBAI: With a waiting queue running into several decades for an employment-linked Green Card, a growing number of Indians continue to resort to a faster way to live permanently in the US.The investment-linked Green Card program (EB-5) comes in handy for those H-1Bs who can afford it-despite the significant investment involved, a wait-time of a few years compares favourably with an endless wait for the coveted Green Card. The EB-5 program also finds favour among high networth individuals (HNIs) in India, who are looking at securing their children's future in America. Investors initially obtain a conditional Green Card, which is later converted into a permanent Green Card. (See table).Applicants are required to invest $800,000 (about Rs 7.1 crore) or $1,050,000 (about Rs 9.3 crore), depending on the project's type and/or location, and must create or preserve at least 10 full-time American jobs. Most investors route their funds through regional centers (USCIS-designated entities) that pool EB-5 capital into large-scale projects. Over 90% of EB-5 investments in recent years have been made through these centers rather than via direct investments.Soon after being sworn in as US president, Donald Trump announced he would launch a 'Gold Card'; commerce secretary Howard Lutnick added this could replace the EB-5 program with Gold-Card funds going directly to the US govt. This led to jitters among the EB-5 investors and those aspiring for a Green Card under this investment-linked route.On Sept 19, Trump signed an executive order to introduce the 'Gold Card' visa program. Individuals wishing to qualify for Gold Card must make an unrestricted gift of $1 million (about Rs 8.4 crore) to US Department of Commerce. If a corporation or similar entity makes the gift on behalf of the individual, the required amount rises to $2 million (about Rs 16.8 crore).The modalities of the Gold Card are yet to be rolled out. A key difference between the two programs lies not just in the amounts to be paid, but the fact that the Gold Card entails a 'fee', whereas the EB-5 program requires an 'investment'-with a return on capital.As things stand, the long-term future of the EB-5 program remains unclear. Immigration attorneys point out that the EB-5 Regional Center (RC) Program has been reauthorised until 2027 by the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act (RIA) of 2022. Those who have invested, or plan to invest, before Sept 2026 will be protected from future lapses in the program owing to the RIA's grandfathering clause. The clause seems to have eased initial jitters among aspiring investors. Many of India's high networth families are turning to this path to secure long-term US residency for their kids. Mid-career professionals already in the US on H-1B visas -where Green Card backlogs stretch to decades-are increasingly joining them.According to US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) data, the EB-5 program drew $4.1 billion in the first three quarters of FY2025- nearly matching investment for the entire previous year.Since the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act (RIA) came into effect in 2022, around 1,050- 1,150 Indians have filed EB-5 applications, according to USCIS filing data. This places India as the second-largest EB-5 applicant group globally, accounting for roughly 20- 22% of all new post-RIA filings. The demand has remained consistent month-to-month, driven by both H-1B families already in the US facing decades-long Green Card wait times and by high networth families in India planning long-term residency and education pathways for their children.""Most people still believe that once their child gets into a decent US university, they can build a career there,"" said Piyush Gupta, vice-president of CanAm Enterprises, which operates several licensed regional centers. However, uncertainties arising out of ever-changing and tightening H-1B policies prompts many to explore EB-5, he added.For Prahlad Purohit, a 43-year-old Google engineer from Mumbai, the decision was driven by family rather than finance. After nearly a decade in the US, he feared his two India-born children would lose their dependent status when they turned 21. ""My son couldn't even apply for internships because he wasn't a resident,"" Purohit said over a call from San Francisco. ""Both my children grew up here, they don't know the system in India. That's when I chose EB-5.""Speaking to TOI on a Zoom from Mountview, California, he recalls how he selected his investment. ""It's like the Wild West, with many claiming they're the best and promising exorbitant returns on top of the Green Card-from almond farms to hotel chains,"" he said. ""I finally chose a real estate development in Manhattan that was building a corporate skyscraper.""Despite the high approval rate for applications, the EB-5 route remains a high-stakes bet: a blend of financial investment, immigration strategy, and faith in the American market. As Gupta put it, ""For many of our clients, this isn't about returns-it's about certainty. They'd rather invest in a project than a house, if it means their family never has to rely on H-1B visa lottery again.""","The investment-linked Green Card program (EB-5) comes in handy for those H-1Bs who can afford it. Despite the significant investment involved, a wait-time of a few years compares favourably with an endless wait for the coveted Green Card.

Justice Ramana

slams attempts to crush farmers’ movement

Justice N V Ramana (retd) disclosed Saturday that the Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy government filed police cases against his family to target him before he became the Chief Justice of India in 2021 because they supported Amaravati capital city project of Andhra Pradesh.""All of you present here know how my family was targeted and criminal cases were filed against them. All this was done only to coerce me,"" he said while addressing students at the convocation ceremony of VIT-AP at Amaravati.The Jagan Reddy government diluted the previous N Chandrababu Naidu government's Amaravati capital project by announcing the trifurcation of the capital, which was opposed by farmers whose land had already been acquired.The farmers agitated for five years from 2019 till 2024 and the trifurcation idea was dropped after the Chandrababu Naidu government returned to office last year.Recalling his deep association with Amaravati since his student days, he said, ""Present-day Amaravati owes its existence to the resilience of the farmers of this region. The city survives on the back of the farmers' struggle, one of the longest in southern India.""Talking about attempts to ""crush the farmers' struggle"", Justice Ramana said, ""Rarely the media or any politician ever spoken the truth or given real credit as to how the capital of Amaravati survived and sustained,"" he said.Briefly touching on the ""painful days of police action"" against his family members, the former CJI said, ""I was not alone. During that difficult period, all those who empathised with the cause of the farmers, faced intimidation and coercion."" ""Even members of the judiciary who upheld constitutional principles faced transfers, pressure, and at times, persecution. Families of judges, who had no role, suffered collateral damage because of political machinations,"" he said.In these testing times, many political leaders hesitated to take a stand and preferred silence, he said. ""It was the jurists, lawyers and the courts which stood by their constitutional promise,"" he said. ""While govts may change, the courts and the rule of law remain as the anchor of stability. The rule of law survives only when people, in whom the public repose trust, decline to surrender their integrity for convenience,"" he said.""In the coming times, the role of farmers, lawyers, jurists, members of civil society and judges will have to remain the enduring source of inspiration with their integrity and commitment to rule of law,"" he said.",Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy government filed police cases against his family to target him before he became the Chief Justice of India in 2021.

Taliban to appoint its 1st diplomat in Delhi this month,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/taliban-to-appoint-its-1st-diplomat-in-delhi-this-month/articleshow/125041810.cms,"Taliban Confirms India’s Intel, ISI And Pakistan Army Backing IS-Khorasan Terror Network Operations

NEW DELHI: India and Afghanistan are set to further ramp up their diplomatic relations with the appointment of a diplomat by the Taliban regime here this month. This will be the first official placement of a diplomat by the Taliban in India since their return to Kabul in August 2021 and will be followed - as conveyed by Kabul to Indian authorities - by the appointment of another diplomat in late December or early January.The relationship has progressed steadily this year, culminating in an unprecedented visit by foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi to India last month. India has reinforced its role as a trusted partner of Afghanistan with its continued supply of aid and medical supplies to the country, even in the absence of an official recognition by the Indian govt of the dispensation in Kabul.Muttaqi's visit saw India announcing its decision to upgrade its technical mission in Kabul to the level of embassy and also agreeing to accept Taliban diplomats. Both sides are expected to soon have a charge d'affaires leading their respective missions.A Taliban spokesperson on Sunday expressed appreciation for India's donation of over 16 tonnes of anti-vector-borne disease medicines. ""This latest donation underscores India's longstanding partnership and developmental support to Afghanistan. By contributing essential medical supplies, India reaffirms its role as a reliable partner in promoting health, stability and humanitarian cooperation in the region,"" he said.Muttaqi's visit was significant as it also saw the Taliban backing India's sovereignty over J&K. India too has firmly supported Afghanistan's sovereignty and territorial integrity, at a time the Taliban's ties with Pakistan have hit a nadir because of heavy border clashes. The two countries have reached a ceasefire but the threat of an escalation is yet to fully dissipate. The Taliban this week accused Pakistan of working to create chaos in Afghanistan that would allow the US to return and take over Bagram airbase.","The relationship has progressed steadily this year, culminating in an unprecedented visit by foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi to India last month.

ISRO Makes History As ‘Bahubali’ Rocket Places India’s Heaviest Communication Satellite In Orbit

The Indian Space Research Organisation ISRO ) on Sunday successfully launched CMS-03, the heaviest communication satellite to be launched from India, onboard its LVM3-M5 (GSLV-MkIII) heavy-lift rocket from the Second Launch Pad at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre , Sriharikota. The mission marks the fifth operational flight of the LVM3 vehicle. The previous mission using the rocket was Chandrayaan-3 on July 14, 2023.Around 16minutes after liftoff, the rocket with a total lift off mass of 642 tonnes and a height of 43.5 metres, placed the 4410-kg CMS-03 satellite into a Geo-synchronous Transfer Orbit (GTO).The mission’s flight sequence began with the ignition of both S200 boosters at lift-off, followed by their separation at around 131.14 seconds when the vehicle reached an altitude of 62.3 km. The L110 stage ignited at 106.94 seconds and separated at 304.70 seconds, at an altitude of 166.9 km. The C25 cryogenic stage ignited at 307.10 seconds and continued its burn until 950.94 seconds, achieving an inertial velocity of 10.14 km/s. The CMS-03 satellite separated from the launch vehicle at 965.94 seconds at an altitude of 179.8 km, completing its insertion into the targeted orbit.PM Modi congratulated Isro and wrote on social media platform X, ""Our space sector continues to make us proud! Congratulations ISRO on the successful launch of India’s heaviest communication satellite, CMS-03.Powered by our space scientists, it is commendable how our space sector has become synonymous with excellence and innovation. Their successes have furthered national progress and empowered countless lives. ""The LVM3-M5 vehicle, which has seven consecutive successful missions, consisted of two solid strap-on boosters (S200), a liquid core stage (L110), and a cryogenic upper stage (C25), all housed within a 5-metre diameter Ogive Payload Fairing. Each S200 motor carried 204.5 tonnes of Hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB)-based solid propellant, while the L110 core contained 115.9 tonnes of UH25 and N2O4 liquid propellants. The C25 cryogenic stage was loaded with 28.6 tonnes of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen.On the occasion, Isro chairman V Narayanan said, ""LVM3-M5 successfully injected into the required orbit precisely. This is the 8th consecutive successful launch by LVM3. CMS-03 is the heaviest satellite placed in GTO orbit. The vehicle performance was enhanced to increase its payload capacity by 10%.""""The satellite has a life of 15 years and carries a host of new technologies. We accomplished this mission despite the difficult weather condition. The launch also had the reignition of C20 cryogenic engine for the first time after placing the satellite. This will help in placing satellites in multiple orbits using LVM3"", he further added.CMS-03 is a multi-band communication satellite designed to provide services over a wide oceanic region, including the Indian landmass.Narayanan said there will be seven more launches in this financial year. This includes the LVM3-M6 launching a customer satellite in the second week of December; PSLV-C62 launch and SSLV-L1 launch, placing customer satellites; PSLV technology demonstration of 34 new technologies, and the first uncrewed mission of Gaganyaan.The satellite will be used for civilian and strategic purposes.","ISRO Makes History As ‘Bahubali’ Rocket Places India’s Heaviest Communication Satellite In Orbit.

PM Modi Rips Into RJD-Congress For ‘Insulting Faith’, Warns Bihar Voters

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday sharpened his attack on the Opposition’s INDIA bloc during his campaign rallies in Bihar’s Arrah, Bhojpur, and Nawada districts, alleging that the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) “forced” the Congress to announce Tejashwi Yadav as their chief ministerial candidate.As per PTI, PM Modi claimed that the Congress “never wanted” Tejashwi to be declared the alliance’s CM face but was pressured into doing so. “The RJD secured it by placing a katta (country-made gun) on the head of the Congress. They have learnt their lessons in the school of jungle raj. Such elements can never do good for Bihar,” he said at a rally in Bhojpur.The Prime Minister alleged that the RJD’s “hooliganism” and “strong-arm politics” reflected the party’s old ways of governance.As per news agency ANI, the Prime Minister said, “Just a day before nomination filing, behind closed doors, gundagardi was happening. Congress did not want to have an RJD CM, but RJD did not leave the opportunity. They put a gun on Congress' head and stole the CM’s post.”He further claimed that the alliance partners were divided and would “break each other’s heads” after the elections.PM Modi also said that the ruling NDA represented unity and development, while the Opposition alliance symbolised “jungle raj marked by katta, grirta, katuta, kusanskar, kushashan, and corruption.”He alleged that the RJD-Congress combine was working to “erase Bihar’s identity” by supporting infiltrators.In Nawada, PM Modi highlighted the NDA’s promise to give an additional Rs 3,000 to farmers under the state’s ‘Kapurgari Thakur Kisan Samman Nidhi’ scheme, over and above the ₹6,000 provided annually under the PM Kisan Samman Nidhi.“This is Modi — jinhe koi nahi poochhta, Modi unhe poojta hai (Modi worships those whom no one else cares about),” he said, as reported by ANI.The PM claimed Rs 650 crore had already been deposited into accounts of two lakh farmers in Nawada and noted that the NDA’s policies were aimed at uplifting small farmers, “ignored since Independence.”He also took a swipe at the Congress for corruption during past governments, recalling Rajiv Gandhi’s remark that only “15 paisa out of every rupee sent from Delhi reached the villages.”PM Modi added that his government ensures that “the full amount reaches farmers without any cut or commission.”As per news agency PTI, the PM urged people to reject “those responsible for jungle raj,” asserting that the NDA government was “upright, foresighted, and committed to building a developed Bihar as part of a Viksit Bharat.”He also invoked Operation Sindoor, saying it “made the nation proud,” and targeted the Congress for “losing sleep when terrorists were being bombed.”Polling for Bihar’s 243 assembly seats will take place in two phases: on November 6 and 11, with counting on November 14.",PM Narendra Modi sharpened his attack on the Opposition’s INDIA bloc during his campaign rallies in Bihar.

NEW DELHI: Union home minister Amit Shah on Thursday criticised Congress MP Rahul Gandhi , alleging that Gandhi insulted the Chhath Puja festival as he is ignorant of India's culture since Italy is his ""maternal home"".Addressing multiple rallies in Bihar, Shah said the INDIA bloc will be ""wiped out"" and that voters would ""avenge"" what he called an ""insult to Chhathi Maiyya"". He also referred to an earlier incident where Congress workers in the state allegedly abused Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s mother.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had held one of his election meetings in the Muzaffarpur on Wednesday, and alleged that the PM had tried to enact a ""drama"" by planning to take a dip in the Yamuna at Delhi, on the occasion of Chhath Puja.He had alleged that Modi gave up his plans to take a dip when it came to light that the spot he had chosen was a puddle created with clean, piped water, since the Yamuna was extremely polluted and not fit for a bath.""Rahul baba has said Modi and others who worshipped Chhathi Maiyya were indulging in drama. His maternal roots are in Italy, and hence he has no idea about the country's culture,"" Shah said, as quoted by PTI. He asked voters to press the EVM button on NDA symbols ""with such rage that the tremors are felt in Italy"".The home minister accused the Congress and its allies of preventing the construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya. He said, ""thwarting for 70 years"" the construction of the temple, which he said had been a matter of struggle ""since the times of the Mughals, and continued under the British"".Shah praised the Modi government for developing a new university at Nalanda, saying ""no Bakhtiyar Khilji will be able to destroy"" it. He also mentioned an ongoing project worth about Rs 850 crore to develop Punaura Dham in Sitamarhi district, which is linked to the birthplace of Goddess Sita. ""In two years from now, you will see PM Modi performing the consecration ceremony (pran pratishtha) at Punaura Dham,"" he said.At a rally in Nalanda, Shah opened his speech with references to Chanakya and Chandragupta Maurya. He then criticised the previous RJD governments led by Lalu Prasad and Rabri Devi, saying Bihar witnessed ""over 32,000 kidnappings and 12 major massacres"" during their tenure. He said, ""Nitish Kumar ended the ‘jungle raj’... but RJD is trying to bring back ‘jungle raj’ in the state with a new face.""Shah rejected claims by Tejashwi Yadav that the NDA would take back money deposited in women’s accounts under welfare schemes. ""Nobody can dare to take that money back. RJD leaders must give up this diatribe,"" he said.The home minister said that during Nitish Kumar’s time in power, ""there has been a 20 per cent drop in murders while dacoities and kidnappings have gone down by 80 per cent"". He added, ""We are preparing the youth of Bihar to win medals in the 2036 Olympics that will happen in India.""","Amit Shah takes 'Italy' Jibe at Rahul Gandhi after Cong MP Targets PM Modi over Chhath 'Nautanki' He asks voters to press the EVM button on NDA symbols ""with such rage that the tremors are felt in Italy""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124980899,imgsize-681244,width-400,resizemode-4/lkn-35.jpg"

Rare earth nod comes with no-export rider





NEW DELHI: Govt on Thursday announced ""some Indian companies"" have got approval from China to import rare earth magnets, to be used in automotive and electronics industries.MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said licenses have been issued, which will enable access to the magnets whose procurement had been stopped after China put curbs on their sale earlier this year.MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal on Thursday confirmed that some Indian companies have received licences for importing rare earth magnets from China, while responding to questions on the matter.""As far as the question of the latest talks and relaxations that have happened between the US and China (and) as to how it is going to play into our domain, I will come back to you. We have yet to look at it. I am not aware of the technicalities... But I do confirm that Indian companies have received licenses for importing rare earths from China,"" he said.Jaiswal, however, did not give details of the companies that have received permission. Industry sources said the companies include those that supply components to the automotive and electronics industries.However, the imports come with certain restrictions. These include conditions that the magnets cannot be exported to the US, and cannot be used for defence-related industries.The curbs have impacted the production of automobiles, especially electric cars and two-wheelers with companies petitioning govt to take up the matter with China.Rare earth magnets are the strongest type of permanent magnets commercially available. Their high magnetic strength and resistance to demagnetisation make them indispensable in a range of applications, especially where weight and space are constraints.According to experts, these magnets are made primarily from rare earth elements like neodymium, praseodymium, and dysprosium - materials that allow for powerful magnetic properties essential in miniaturised and energy-efficient devices. They are typically made from alloys that contain rare earth elements. The most commonly used rare earth magnet is the neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) magnet.China is estimated to account for about 70% of global rare earth metals mining and holds nearly 90% of the world's rare earth magnet's production. One of the biggest reasons that China dominates the rare earth magnet industry is its control over the entire supply chain, including mining of rare earth ores, separation and refining of rare earth elements (a complex and environmentally sensitive process), and alloy production and magnet manufacturing.Just in the Indian auto industry alone, about 870 tonnes of rare-earth magnets are required to be imported in FY 2025-26 out of the country's estimated overall requirement of 3,600 tonnes.","MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said licenses have been issued, which will enable access to the magnets.

Soybean purchases resume

China to lift trade barriers

Port fees and shipping dispute





The trade talks between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in Busan last week resulted in several breakthrough agreements, easing tensions for the two economies.These ranged from soybean purchases, tariff cuts and rare-earth export restrictions and more, though details were initially withheld.The White House on Saturday unveiled the complete terms of the deal, confirming that both sides have agreed to a temporary pause in their prolonged trade dispute.The agreement freezes new tariffs and export curbs, reinstates major agricultural purchases, and creates a one-year negotiation window. The White House said it also blocks a planned 100% tariff on Chinese goods, while China will pause its latest restrictions on rare earth minerals and magnets used in key industries.Here are what the two nations have agreed to:A key provision is a reduction in US tariffs on Chinese imports linked to supplies of precursor chemicals used to make fentanyl. The tariff rate on those products, imposed earlier this year at 20%, will be lowered to 10%.Officials said this will bring the overall US tariff rate on Chinese imports down to roughly 47%, from the current 57%, once Trump’s earlier duties and a 10% “reciprocal” tariff introduced in April are accounted for, Reuters reported.Beijing has agreed to suspend for one year the new export controls announced this month, which would have required licences for the export of rare earths and magnets, even when present only in trace amounts. The White House described this as “the de facto removal of controls China imposed in April 2025 and October 2022.”China will issue general licences covering rare earths, gallium, germanium, antimony and graphite for US users and their supply chains.Washington has agreed to freeze plans for a one-year expansion of its commerce department entity list, which would have prohibited US companies from selling technology, including semiconductor manufacturing equipment, to any firm more than 50% owned by an already-restricted entity.The measure would have added thousands of additional Chinese companies to the blacklist.China will also suspend all retaliatory tariffs introduced since 4 March, covering a wide range of American products including chicken, wheat, corn, cotton, sorghum, soybeans, pork, beef, aquatic products, fruits, vegetables and dairy.In addition, it will withdraw non-tariff countermeasures taken over the same period, such as putting US companies on “end user” and “unreliable entity” lists, Reuters reported.China has committed to buying at least 12 million metric tonnes of US soybeans during the final two months of 2025, and at least 25 million metric tonnes per year for the following three years. Purchases of US sorghum and hardwood logs will also resume.The White House acknowledged that China had “largely stopped buying US soybeans this autumn,” after turning to Brazil and Argentina instead.China will extend its market-based tariff exclusion process on US imports until 31 December 2026 and will terminate antitrust, anti-monopoly and anti-dumping investigations targeting American firms in the semiconductor supply chain.Beijing will also restart trade operations from Nexperia’s China facilities, allowing legacy chip production to reach global markets.China will remove retaliatory measures linked to the US Section 301 investigation into China’s control over global shipbuilding and logistics. The US, in turn, will pause for one year the new port fees that took effect on October 14, which applied to Chinese-built, -owned and -flagged vessels and were designed to boost US shipbuilding, as per a Reuters report. The White House said these fees, coupled with newly imposed 100% tariffs on Chinese-made ship-to-shore cranes, had already disrupted cargo movements and driven up shipping costs.Negotiations on maritime issues will continue alongside talks with South Korea and Japan on reviving US shipbuilding.The new arrangement marks a fragile but significant de-escalation in the trade war between Washington and Beijing, at least for the next 12 months.","The White House on Saturday unveiled the complete terms of the deal, confirming that both sides have agreed to a temporary pause in their prolonged trade dispute.

The Asian Arowana: Ancient fish that rules the modern aquarium



The Asian Arowana: From banned species to billion-dollar status symbol



The super red Arowana : The fiery dragon fish worth more than gold



Also Read |





For centuries, dragons have embodied prosperity, power, and mystery in Asian culture. Today, that legend lives on in the Asian arowana, famously known as the dragon fish and hailed as the world’s most expensive aquarium fish. Native to the rivers and swamps of Southeast Asia, this ancient predator moves with elegant precision, its metallic scales shimmering like coins of gold under filtered light. As highlighted by National Geographic, the arowana’s mythical resemblance to dragons has made it a potent symbol of luck and wealth across generations. Coveted by collectors, enthusiasts, and investors alike, it now commands staggering prices, often exceeding the value of gold, transforming a once humble river dweller into a living emblem of prosperity, success, and timeless prestige.The Asian arowana (Scleropages formosus) is no ordinary tropical fish. Growing up to three feet in length, it glides through the dark waters of Southeast Asia with hypnotic grace, its large, shimmering scales catching light like polished coins. Two slender barbels extend from its chin, evoking the whiskers of a dragon, a resemblance that fuels its legendary reputation as a bearer of fortune, power, and eternal protection across Asian cultures.This prehistoric species, believed to have existed since the age of dinosaurs, thrives in slow-moving rivers and peat swamps in Borneo, Malaysia, and Indonesia. Yet, it is far from a humble creature. In the modern world, an arowana can command prices as high as £250,000 per fish, a valuation that has elevated it from swamp inhabitant to luxury treasure.In the 1970s, the Asian arowana was added to the list of endangered species under CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora). The trade ban was meant to protect its dwindling numbers in the wild. Instead, it ignited a new kind of frenzy.The ban transformed the arowana from a simple food fish into an elite, forbidden object of desire. Collectors across Asia began competing for the rare, mystical “dragon fish.” Suddenly, what once sold for a few dollars in a local market became a high-stakes commodity worth tens of thousands.By the late 20th century, farms in Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia began breeding the fish legally under government licence. These operations were run like fortresses with guards, surveillance systems, and barbed wire to protect their valuable stock. Each fish was microchipped and issued an identification certificate to prove its legal, captive-bred origin. Despite such measures, black market smuggling and theft became part of the trade’s darker undercurrent.Among the many colour varieties, green, gold, and silver, the Super Red arowana reigns supreme. Found in the remote Kapuas River basin and the Lake Sentarum wetlands of Borneo, its scales shimmer in rich shades of ruby and crimson. In the right light, it appears almost aflame, like a dragon rising from the depths.This rare beauty can sell for astronomical prices. Reports claim that elite collectors, including high-ranking officials and business magnates, have spent more than £200,000 for a single fish. During international fish exhibitions, these rare specimens are transported in tanks escorted by security guards proof that even a creature of water can inspire terrestrial greed and glamour.Former Indonesian president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono was said to have owned one himself, paying around £10,000 for his prized arowana. For many, ownership signifies not just wealth, but alignment with luck, prosperity, and spiritual balance.","The Asian arowana (Scleropages formosus) is no ordinary tropical fish.

India’s tech pay plunges 40% as US engineers strike gold in the AI boom,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/education/news/indias-tech-pay-plunges-40-as-us-engineers-strike-gold-in-the-ai-boom/articleshow/125034791.cms,"Deel and equity management firm Carta

India’s decline: From tech powerhouse to cost correction zone



Meanwhile, in the US: Tech talent becomes gold

Gender parity: India’s quiet strength amid the storm



The future of tech work: Diverging realities

The paychecks that once symbolised India’s ascent as a global technology hub are shrinking, sharply. According to a joint report by payroll and compliance platform, median compensation for engineering and data roles in India has nosedived by 40%, plunging to $22,000 in 2025 from $36,000 a year earlier. In sharp contrast, their counterparts in the United States have seen salaries soar by 23%, reaching record highs as tech firms there recalibrate to retain scarce talent in an AI-driven economy.The findings reveal a widening chasm between two geographies that once marched in step during the digital boom. The pandemic-era surge in global remote hiring and dollar-linked pay scales has now given way to corrections in emerging markets like India, where cost rationalisation and hiring freezes have curbed compensation growth. Meanwhile, in the US, a battle for top-tier engineers and data scientists, especially in AI, cloud computing, and cybersecurity, continues to drive compensation upwards, despite broader economic caution.The report’s data paints a sobering picture of India’s tech workforce. Engineering and data professionals, once the poster children of the country’s IT success story, are now bearing the brunt of global recalibration.Deel and Carta’s joint analysis shows that median compensation for engineering and data roles has dropped 40% in just a year, a steep fall rarely seen in India’s thriving digital economy.Experts attribute this decline to shrinking global remote contracts, the return of in-office mandates in Western markets, and a sharp correction in startup valuations, which has eroded equity-linked pay components. The sentiment reflects a broader shift, from exuberant hiring during 2021–22 to pragmatic scaling in 2024–25.Across the Atlantic, the story unfolds in stark contrast. Median compensation for US-based tech professionals surged 23% in 2025, according to Deel and Carta, as competition for specialised roles intensified. With artificial intelligence reshaping industries, companies are racing to recruit engineers proficient in large language models, data architecture, and machine learning deployment. The result? A bidding war that has sent wages soaring, especially in top-tier hubs such as San Francisco, Austin, and New York.The rise in compensation underscores the paradox of a market where automation displaces some roles even as it inflates the value of others.While India’s compensation figures have dipped, the country has quietly achieved what many Western economies still struggle with: Near gender pay parity in tech. The Deel–Carta report observed that our country has demonstrated near parity in tech roles, with sales accomplishing full gender equality.The emerging divide between India and the US is more than just a reflection of macroeconomic forces; it is a signal of how the global geography of work is being redrawn. For India, the short-term pay decline could lead to long-term resilience, as companies restructure compensation models toward sustainable, performance-linked pay rather than inflated global parity. For the US, the escalation in wages is both a boon and a warning, fueling innovation yet also intensifying cost pressures in an already expensive labour market.As the dust settles on a year of economic realignment, one truth stands out: The digital economy’s backbone, its people, are no longer moving in unison. The pay packets of coders, designers, and data scientists have become the new fault lines in a world still trying to balance ambition with affordability.","Median compensation for engineering and data roles in India has nosedived by 40%, plunging to $22,000 in 2025 from $36,000 a year earlier. In sharp contrast, their counterparts in the United States have seen salaries soar by 23%, reaching record highs.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125034807,imgsize-11104,width-400,resizemode-4/artificial-intelligence.jpg"

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy says that the company’s latest round of layoffs that impacted barely 14,000 people is not because of money or AI. Instead, the real reason behind Amazon job cuts is the culture, Jassy said. “The announcement that we made a few days ago was not really financially driven, and it's not even really AI-driven, not right now at least,” he said as quoted by Business Insider. “It really — it's culture.”“And if you grow as fast as we did for several years, the size of businesses, the number of people, the number of locations, the types of businesses you're in, you end up with a lot more people than what you had before, and you end up with a lot more layers,” Jassy explained.“And when that happens, Sometimes, without realizing it, you can weaken the ownership of the people that you have who are doing the actual work,” he added. “And it can lead to slowing you down.”In a blog post dated October 28, Amazon's senior vice president of people experience and technology, Beth Galetti announced that the e-commerce company is “making organizational changes across Amazon that will impact some of our teammates.”“While this will include reducing in some areas and hiring in others, it will mean an overall reduction in our corporate workforce of approximately 14,000 roles,” she said.Amazon’s latest job cuts is the company’s biggest layoff since 2022 when the company laid off 27,000 positions. Jassy’s remarks contradict what Amazon executive has been saying about the job cuts.In the blog post, Beth Galetti explained “This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones). We’re convinced that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business.”Separately, Tapas Roy, vice president of device software and services sent a company-wide email this week saying the company is cutting roles within its OS & Services team and asked remaining workers to ""lean in on AI.""","Amazon CEO Andy Jassy says that the company’s latest round of layoffs that impacted barely 14,000 people is not because of money or AI. “The announcement that we made a few days ago was not really financially driven, and it's not even really AI-driven, not right now at least,” he said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124986273,imgsize-17580,width-400,resizemode-4/amazon-ceo-andy-jassy.jpg"

Apple iPhone sales





Apple reported a surprise fall in sales in China. However, much to investors and the company's relief, the fall has not been due to the decline in demand. Apple reportedly blamed the surprise decline in China revenue on supply disruptions. According to a report in Bloomberg, Apple has predicted that the company will return to growth in the world’s biggest smartphone arena as the iPhone 17 gains momentum. Apple CEO Tim Cook said at the earnings call, “It was basically supply constraints that drove the results.” Cook added, “We’re thrilled with what we’re seeing right now.”Apple CEO said that Apple’s store traffic is up significantly in China, and that the latest iPhones -- iPhone 17 series -- has been well received. Cook also said that Apple reached a new high for September-quarter revenue from services in China, while reiterating that the iPhone is doing very well.According to the report, China was a prominent topic during the earning conference, with analysts asking about the region multiple times. The threat of higher tariffs has disrupted global tech supply chain that’s already in flux because of longer-term decisions to diversify away from China.Apple’s total growth projection for the December quarter is between 10% and 12%. Cook, however, didn't specify how much China would contribute to that.Apple has seen stiffer competition from local brands in China. Reports suggest that Huawei Technologies took the top spot in June, as its campaign to reclaim a bigger share of the premium tier resonated with Chinese consumers. Xiaomi too is reported to have made a splash with its Xiaomi 17 series.IDC estimates that 58.6 million iPhones were sold worldwide in the July-September quarter, putting Apple second behind Samsung at 61.4 million of their Android-powered phones sold worldwide in the quarter.In a conference call with analysts, Tim Cook indicated his belief that the iPhone 17 lineup will continue to do well, predicting even more of the devices will be sold during the final three months of the year. “As we head into the holiday season with our most powerful lineup ever, I couldn’t be more excited for what’s to come,” Cook said. Apple expects its iPhone sales to increase at least 10% from last year's holiday season, according to projections provided by Apple's chief financial officer, Kevan Parekh. Total revenue is expected to rise at a similar rate.","Apple reported a surprise fall in sales in China.

CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Meta Q3 results





President Donald Trump's Big Beautiful Bill has resulted in a $16 billion hit for Mark Zuckerberg 's Meta. Meta Platforms has taken a near $16 billion one-off charge in the third quarter (Q3) related to President Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill. The company, which owns Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram, said that the bill had led the business to take a non-cash income tax charge of $15.93 billion. Meta said that excluding this, its third-quarter net income would have increased by $15.93 billion to $18.64 billion, compared with the reported net income of $2.71 billion. The expense crashed Meta's third-quarter profit.Incidentally, this is the same bill that Elon Musk and President TrumpThe implementation of Donald Trump's 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act led to “the recognition of a valuation allowance against our U.S. federal deferred tax assets, reflecting the impact of the U.S. Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax,” Meta said. Meta also said, “We expect a significant reduction in our U.S. federal cash tax payments for the remainder of 2025 and future years due to the implementation of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. ”The markets didn't seem pleased with $16 billion charge taken by Meta, as the company's stock fell sharply lower on Wall Street, though briefly.The shares fell $53.60, or 7 per cent, to $698.99 in after-hours trading on Wall Street but recovered to close at $751.67, up less than 1 per cent.“We had a strong quarter for our business and our community,” Mark Zuckerberg, Meta founder and CEO, said in announcing the results. “Meta Superintelligence Labs is off to a great start and we continue to lead the industry in AI glasses.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

This government has failed in all sectors,"" Tejashwi said, accusing the Nitish Kumar–PM Modi-led coalition of ""failing Bihar on every front.""Taking a pointed jab at the chief minister, the RJD leader added, ""CM might not even know what is in that manifesto. Perhaps the press conference was cut short to prevent him from speaking.""Also Read: Bihar elections 2025: NDA vs Mahagathbandhan manifesto war — who promised what Confident of Mahagathbandhan’s prospects in state, Tejashwi said, ""This is just 'jumla.'

People of the state want to end unemployment.""Accusing the NDA of stealing his ideas, he said, ""They copy everything.They say they will provide one crore jobs. They ask me where will I generate jobs from. They should say where will they do it from.""RJD MP and party supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav’s daughter, Misa Bharti, also hit out at the NDA’s manifesto, questioning the alliance’s job promises. ""How will they provide that (1 crore government jobs)? Where will they get the money from? When we said we would provide 10 lakh government jobs, we did.

They talk about bringing industries to every district, but Amit Shah asked where we would get land for industries.

Chief Minister Nitish Kumar was joined by BJP president JP Nadda, Union ministers Jitan Ram Manjhi and Chirag Paswan, and RLM chief Upendra Kushwaha.BJP’s Bihar chief Dilip Jaiswal hailed the document as “the guarantee of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the trust of Bihar CM Nitish Kumar,” likening the alliance to the “Pandavas” of the Mahabharata. “The people of Bihar trust the guarantees of PM Modi and CM Nitish Kumar,” he said, adding that voters would “never forgive Rahul Gandhi and Tejashwi Yadav” for the “ruin of Bihar.”","The ruling NDA alliance in Bihar on Friday released its election manifesto, the ""Sankalp Patra"" The move quickly drew sharp fire from the opposition Mahagathbandhan bloc.

"From ambulance to ashes, every step had a ‘rate’: Ex-BPCL officer’s viral post sparks probe in Bengaluru; 2 cops suspended",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/what-will-the-poor-do-ex-bpcl-officials-ordeal-exposes-graft-web-hms-zero-tolerance-claim-questioned/articleshow/125046120.cms,"



BENGALURU: Former BPCL chief financial officer K Sivakumar, whose 34-yearold daughter Akshaya died of a brain haemorrhage in Sept, exposed deeprooted decay within the administrative machinery when he alleged he was forced to pay bribes at every stage — from ambulance operators and police to crematorium and BBMP staff — to complete last rites.In a now-deleted LinkedIn post, he wrote: “With no empathy for a father who lost his only child. Very sad state. I had money, I paid. What will the poor do.’’ The post went viral, prompting outrage and forcing home minister G Parameshwara to respond. A PSI and a constable from Bellandur police station were suspended. “The govt will not be lenient to anyone accepting bribes in any department, including police,” Parameshwara said.But his promise runs hollow with the reaction on the ground being one of scepticism. Citizens viewed the incident as a symptom of a wider malaisethat runs through every layer of administration. From municipal offices to revenue departments, and from police stations to regional transport offices, the ‘price tag’ culture has become institutionalised. Sources say transfers, licences, clearances, and even basic services often come at a cost.The muchdebated paid transfer system in the police department is only a part of a larger parallel economy thriving within the govt machinery.A recently retired police officer admitted that transparency and fixed tenures remain a challenge. Sources say inspectors seeking prime postings spend between Rs 50 lakh and Rs 1 crore. Similar practices are reported inthe revenue and urban development departments, where officials pay hefty sums for plum posts linked to land, real estate, or enforcement. These positions, in turn, become instruments to recover and multiply the “investment” through bribes and kickbacks.Though the Supreme Court’s 2006 directive mandated independent police establishment boards and other institutional mechanisms to curb political interference, reforms have largely remained on paper. Frequent reshuffles, interference through ‘recommendations’, and politically motivated transfers continue to erode integrity.Vivek Menon, a campaigner for ethics in politics, said corruption acrossdepartments stems from structural flaws rather than isolated lapses. “Low pay at the lower levels, absence of accountability, and deep political interference have normalised extortion in govt functioning. Transfers and postings are used as rewards and punishments, turning governance into a trade,” he said, adding that the govt should ensure a transparent posting system, strengthen the Lokayukta, and link promotions to integrity records.Former vice-chancellor Prof Harish Ramaswamy said financial and political graft are interdependent. “It is false to claim zero tolerance when the political class itself sustains the system,” he said. “Reports like Dharmaveer and Auradkar have repeatedly recommended administrative and salary reforms, but there is no political will to act.”He said the entire governance structure — not just the police — is caught in a cycle where corruption has become transactional. “Unless postings are depoliticised and the bureaucracy gains institutional independence, zero tolerance will remain rhetoric rather than reform,” he said.","K Sivakumar, whose 34-year-old daughter Akshaya died of a brain haemorrhage in Sept, alleged he was forced to pay bribes at every stage.

Staff shortage reaches breaking point







Flights across the United States faced widespread delays and cancellations over the weekend as the government shutdown entered its second month.At Newark Airport in New Jersey, passengers waited up to three hours, with delays spreading to other New York City airports. Officials warned traveller to expect “schedule changes, gate holds, and missed connections. ”According to FlightAware, by Sunday evening, there were 4,295 delays and 557 cancellations nationwide. Major hubs like Houston, Dallas-Fort Worth, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Denver, and Miami were also hit.The shutdown, which began on October 1, is set to become the longest in US history, surpassing the 35-day record from 2019. It has forced 13,000 air traffic controllers and 50,000 transportation security administration officers to work without pay.The federal aviation administration (FAA) said controllers were under “stress and fatigue” after more than a month without salaries. Still, many continue working to keep flights moving safely.Transportation secretary Sean Duffy said safety remains the top priority, even if it means slowing air traffic.“They need support, they need money, they need a paycheck. They don't need to be fired,” he said on CBS’s Face the Nation.Airlines, including Delta, United, Southwest, and American have joined aviation unions in urging Congress to pass a temporary funding bill — known as a “continuing resolution” — to reopen the government while talks continue.Lawmakers remain divided on how to end the shutdown. Republicans are pushing for a “clean” funding measure, while Democrats want to link it to an extension of healthcare subsidies set to expire later this year.So far, neither side has budged, leaving federal workers unpaid and travellers stranded.Even before the shutdown, the FAA was short around 3,000 air traffic controllers. Now, with thousands unpaid and some calling in sick, staffing shortages are worsening across 35 FAA facilities in major cities like New York, Dallas, Phoenix, and Washington.Experts warn that the situation could soon mirror the 2019 shutdown, when staffing shortages forced widespread flight cancellations.","Flights across the United States faced widespread delays and cancellations over the weekend as the government shutdown entered its second month.

Trump warns of economic collapse: What if Supreme Court strikes down tariffs?

‘One of the most important cases’



Massive tax collection—$100 billion mark reached?







US President Donald Trump has warned that the American economy could face severe damage if the Supreme Court overturns his tariff policy.In an interview at CBS’s “60 Minutes,” Trump was asked what will happen if US Supreme Court invalidates tariffs.""“I think our country will be immeasurably hurt. I think our economy will go to hell. Look, because of tariffs, we have the highest stock market we've ever had,"" he answered.The US President further added, “because of tariffs, 401ks at the highest level, and this is millions and millions of people that we've ever had, 401ks. I think it's the most important subject discussed by the Supreme Court in 100 years.”The interview, conducted at Mar-a-Lago by Norah O’Donnell on Friday and published on Sunday (local time), marks Trump’s first appearance on the programme since he settled a $16 million lawsuit with CBS News earlier this year. CBS has not disclosed how the interview came about or whether any specific terms were set ahead of filming. Although O’Donnell is a former “CBS Evening News” anchor, she is not part of the regular “60 Minutes” correspondent line-up.Trump’s remarks come just days before the Supreme Court begins hearing a case which he has described as “one of the most important cases in the history of our country.”The proceedings will examine whether he had the legal authority to introduce broad tariff measures, with the challenge focused on his use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) as the basis for imposing the import taxes, CNN reported.Earlier this year, Trump used those emergency powers to push tariffs up to 50% on countries such as India and Brazil, and as high as 145% on China, measures that underpin his economic agenda.US Customs and Border Patrol data, cited by CNN shows that, as of September 23, American companies have paid close to $90 billion to cover the tariffs imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).That figure represents more than half of all tariff revenue collected by the US government in the 2025 fiscal year, which closed on September 30.Earlier, in an interview with Fox Business, Trump acknowledged that a loss in court could force the administration to reverse course. He said that if the Supreme Court ruled against him, “we’d have to pay back money” and reimburse companies for the billions they have already paid.Trump has repeatedly promoted the tariff revenue as proof of his strategy’s success, describing the money flowing into federal accounts as historic. “We have a lot of money coming in, much more money than the country’s ever seen,” Trump had said earlier, referring to the revenue generated through tariffs.Figures from the US Treasury Department show that the government collected nearly $30 billion in tariff revenue in July, marking a 242% increase compared to the same period last year.Since April, when Trump introduced a 10% tariff on almost all imported goods, followed by additional increases, total tariff collections have reached $100 billion, which is three times the amount collected in the same four-month segment last year.",US President Donald Trump warns that the American economy could face severe damage if the Supreme Court overturns his tariff policy.

What does the new e-passport rollout actually mean?

New e-passport = chip inside: The upgraded passport contains an electronic chip with digitised passport data to speed up immigration clearance and improve security. Applicants will be able to upload a digital, ICAO-compliant photo, signature and supporting documents through the new portal.

No extra biometrics or fees: The Indian Embassy in Abu Dhabi and the Consulate in Dubai stated explicitly that biometric collection rules and passport fees remain unchanged for applicants in the UAE. If you’ve given biometrics for a recent passport, you will not be asked again just because of the e-passport introduction.

Who issues them: The Embassy and Consulate will process applications through the Passport Seva Portal (GPSP 2.0) with support from BLS International for on-the-ground services. Missions say they can handle large volumes around 1,600 passports a day across the UAE to speed renewals and new issues.

Digital chip with encrypted security data

Improved fraud protection and identity verification

Faster processing at international airports

Globally compliant with ICAO standard

No change in services for Indians in UAE

Conclusion





Indian expats in the UAE can finally put the rumours to rest. During a press conference held on October 30, 2025 by the Embassy of India in Abu Dhabi and the Consulate General of India in Dubai, officials clarified that the rollout of India’s new chip-enabled e-passport will not involve any extra biometrics, new procedures, or fee changes for applicants in the UAE. The announcement came amid widespread speculation about additional requirements for the upgraded passport system.The e-passport looks like a regular passport but comes with a secure embedded chip containing the holder’s personal and biometric data. This upgrade enhances security and helps speed up global immigration checks, making travel simpler and safer.Key features of the e-passport include:The initiative is an important part of India’s ongoing mission to modernise travel documents, strengthen cyber-security measures, and align with global digital passport standards.For Indian residents in the UAE, the e-passport rollout will feel no different from the current process. Applicants will continue to use the same channels — including BLS centres, VFS services (where applicable), and the embassy or consulate counters, without the need for new appointments, extra document checks, or revised fees. The missions also urged the community to rely only on official updates from the Embassy or Consulate, reminding expats not to fall for misinformation circulating on social media.The clarification from the Indian Embassy in Abu Dhabi and the Consulate in Dubai has offered much-needed reassurance to the UAE’s Indian community. With no added fees, no extra biometrics, and no change in the application process, the transition to e-passports is set to be smooth and stress-free for expats. As India modernises its passport system to enhance global travel security, UAE-based applicants can continue using the same familiar services without any disruption. For now, the message is simple: nothing changes for you — just a smarter, more secure passport ahead.","The upgraded passport contains an electronic chip with digitised passport data.

November 2025 fuel prices

What’s Driving the November price Buzz?

Oil prices dropped to around $65 a barrel, raising hopes for a price cut.

Then global supply tensions and sanctions sent prices jumping again up by nearly 5% in one day.

What will become cheaper if prices drop in November?

Daily Commutes Get Cheaper: If you drive to work five days a week, your monthly fuel spend could drop by AED 15–40, depending on distance and car type. It may not feel like a jackpot but over a year, that’s a few brunches saved.

School Runs for Parents: Parents doing multiple school pick-ups and drop-offs will feel this the most. With fewer refills, you save not just dirhams… but also those “Why are we stopping for petrol again?” kid complaints.

Delivery & Ride-Hailing Services: Talabat, Deliveroo, Careem, Uber, RTA taxis, chauffeur services, all rely heavily on petrol costs. If fuel drops, operating costs drop and sometimes customers enjoy lower delivery fees or promo rides.

Business Transport & Logistics: Couriers, small business vans, carpenters, maintenance and AC technicians, all feel the heat when fuel rises. Cheaper petrol can mean:

Lower service charges Fewer fuel surcharges Better deals for customers

Weekends and Road Trips Become More Tempting: Lower fuel prices = guilt-free drives to Abu Dhabi, Fujairah, Ras Al Khaimah or Hatta. A small drop in fuel cost could shave off AED 5–15 per road trip enough to justify that karak stop.

Making climate relatable to students and teachers





That Jeff Grant signs off his emails with ""science on!"" says something about his commitment to the subject he teaches to Illinois high schoolers. Lately, that dedication has meant teaching a topic that makes some educators uncomfortable: the science of climate change.As an avid reader of scientific journals and books, and someone who spends time outdoors, he has a clear understanding of how rising temperatures are impacting the planet.""It's been something that for the last decade or so I've personally seen the effects of,"" he said, citing changes to the aquatic, forest and prairie ecosystems he grew up with. As a result, he has started to ""bake"" our changing climate into his classes.Yale University research suggests his approach would be widely welcomed. Three-quarters of adults in the US say they want schools to teach the causes, consequences and potential solutions to global warming.""Today's students are tomorrow's consumers, workers, and voters, and they're going to be faced with a series of challenges due to the disruptions caused by climate change,"" said Glenn Branch, deputy director of the non-profit National Center for Science Education (NCSE).And to deal with the challenges, he adds they'll need ""at least the basic understanding of climate change and its impacts and solutions.""The NCSE is one of several bodies working to ensure students across the country are given accurate climate information. But the decentralized nature of the US education system means curricula decisions are made at the level of the local school district. And with more than 13,000 of them across the nation, that equates to huge variation.Teachers in some states can look to what are known as the Next Generation Science Standards for guidelines on teaching climate change. But they are not obligatory and don't, Grant says, go far enough.""Not every state has that as part of their curriculum,"" he said, adding that even if they do, they don't offer lesson plans. ""It's up to the teachers or the school districts to develop those things or find things to help them with that presentation to kids.""And that is a problem, given that many educators never learned about climate change themselves. They are faced with huge volumes of potential resources to draw from, as well as competing interests from powerful groups trying to take their own agendas into classrooms.Branch says there have been ""systematic attempts to provide teachers with misinformation about climate change in the hopes they will relate it to their students,"" with material coming from ""very strongly ideologically motivated"" climate change denial think tanks, such as the Heartland Institute, as well as from the fossil fuel industry itself.Groups such as the Oklahoma Energy Resources Board (OERB), which is a privatized state agency, are active in a number of states across the US. And always with an educational arm. ""That material is less blatant,"" Branch said. ""But it can still have a distorting influence.""In the case of the OERB, the material includes a series of illustrated books that see protagonist ""Petro Pete"" praise human dependence on fossil fuels. The agency also provides workshops and curricula that give insights into the oil and gas industry. Educators who sign up are rewarded with professional development credits, stipends and class field trips.Melissa Lau, who teaches science in her native Oklahoma, says such offerings strike a chord with teachers who don't know enough about climate change to teach it.""That's very appealing in many ways. If a teacher is like, 'this seems legit…' I mean, there's not anything wrong with the science. It just gives the impression of 'look how good the fossil fuel industry is.' It minimizes the impact.""OERB did not respond to a DW request for further information.Lau says getting climate change into the classroom in Oklahoma is further complicated by the fact that farming — which is responsible for almost 12% of global emissions — and fossil fuels, are among the state's major industries.""A lot of times it is, 'you know, my dad is just trying to make a living, we're trying to feed our family, keep a roof over our heads.' It gets personal."" In Lau's case, having family members in both industries has helped her to address what she calls ""sticky"" topics with her students.

'Severe water shortages': Pakistan faces 'acute risk' after India’s IWT suspension,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/severe-water-shortages-pakistan-faces-acute-risk-after-indias-iwt-suspension-report/articleshow/125001055.cms,"AI-generated image used for representation

Pakistan Issues Naval Warning as Its War Games Overlap with India’s Military Drills





Pakistan, heavily dependent on the waters of the Indus basin, faces a acute risk of insufficient water storage after India suspended the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) earlier this year, according to the Ecological Threat Report 2025.The report, released by the Institute for Economics and Peace, a Sydney-based independent and non-profit think tank, says the suspension gives India the ability to control the westward flow of the Indus and its tributaries into Pakistan. The move came after India decided to put the treaty in abeyance as a punitive measure following the Pakistan-sponsored Pahalgam terror attack on April 22 this year.This marks a major setback for Pakistan, whose agriculture depends 80 per cent on the Indus River system. The report highlighted that Pakistan’s dams can currently hold only about 30 days of Indus flow, leaving the country highly vulnerable to disruptions.“Pakistan lacks sufficient storage to buffer variations,” the report warned, adding, “If India were truly to cut off or significantly reduce Indus flows, Pakistan’s densely populated plains would face severe water shortages, especially in winter and dry seasons.Indeed, about 80 per cent of Pakistan’s irrigated agriculture depends on Indus basin rivers.”While India’s infrastructure limits its ability to completely stop river flows, even small disruptions could have ""disastrous"" short-term effects on Pakistan’s farm sector.In May, India carried out “reservoir flushing” operations at the Salal and Baglihar dams on the Chenab River without notifying Pakistan. This process, used to remove silt by draining reservoirs, had been restricted under the treaty due to the risk of sudden downstream changes.The impact was immediate: parts of the Chenab River in Pakistan’s Punjab ran dry for several days when India shut the dam gates and later released sediment-filled torrents upon reopening them.The Indus Waters Treaty, signed in 1960 and mediated by the World Bank, has long acted as a key tool for water-sharing and conflict resolution between the two countries. It governs the use of the Indus River and its six major tributaries -- five on the left bank and one on the right.","India suspended the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) earlier this year.

India-Bangladesh trade tensions :







Pakistan has granted Bangladesh access to Karachi Port in an effort to revitalize bilateral trade, marking a notable outcome of the 9th Pak–Bangladesh Joint Economic Commission (JEC) meeting -- the first such dialogue in two decades. The development arrives at a sensitive moment, as Dhaka’s relations with New Delhi grow increasingly strained following the fall of the Sheikh Hasina regime.According to the Pakistani news outlet Samaa TV, the port access would allow Dhaka to expand its trade network with China and Central Asian countries.According to the official statement, the two sides emphasized stronger cooperation between their national shipping lines, the news outlet reported.Pakistan’s decision to open Karachi Port to Bangladeshi vessels is expected to streamline trade routes for Dhaka, while also expanding opportunities for commercial engagement across regional and neighboring markets.Trade tensions between India and Bangladesh have been rising, with New Delhi imposing a series of restrictions on Dhaka’s exports this year. Most recently, India banned the import of select jute products and ropes from Bangladesh via all land routes, requiring shipments to be rerouted through the Nhava Sheva seaport in Maharashtra.These measures follow multiple earlier curbs that limited a wide range of Bangladeshi goods, including garments, processed foods, and jute fabrics, to seaborne entry only. India also withdrew a key transshipment facility in April, further tightening trade access and signaling a deepening strain in bilateral commercial ties.The latest trade curbs unfold amid heightened political friction, following comments made in China by Bangladesh’s interim government chief Muhammad Yunus that sparked sharp criticism across India’s political spectrum. Ties have also deteriorated over Dhaka’s inability to prevent rising violence against minorities, particularly the Hindu community.","Pakistan has granted Bangladesh access to Karachi Port in an effort to revitalize bilateral trade.

A solid gold toilet is up for auction.

Guggenheim Museum in New York. (AP Photo, File)





LONDON: For sale: The world's most valuable toilet, a lavatory literally worth its weight in gold. Sotheby's announced Friday it will auction off the solid gold cistern, a sculpture by Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan entitled ""America. ""The auction house calls it an ""incisive commentary on the collision of artistic production and commodity value."" It's also a fully functional toilet, identical to one that gained global fame when it was stolen in an audacious heist from England's Blenheim Palace in 2019.The starting price at the Nov 18 auction in New York will be the price of the just over 101.2kg of gold used to make it - about $10 million.David Galperin, head of contemporary art at Sotheby's in New York, said Cattelan is ""the consummate art world provocateur."" He's also one of most successful, an artist whose work ""Comedian,"" a banana duct-taped to a wall, sold at a New York auction last year for $6.2 million. ""Him"" - Cattelan's unsettling sculpture of a kneeling Adolf Hitler - sold for $17.2 million at a Christie's auction in 2016.The artist has said ""America"" satirises excessive wealth.""Whatever you eat, a $200 lunch or a $2 hot dog, the results are the same, toilet-wise,"" he once said.Two versions of ""America"" were created in 2016. The one being sold has been owned by an unnamed collector since 2017. The other version went on display in a bathroom at the Guggenheim Museum in New York in 2016. More than 100,000 visitors queued up to - to put it delicately - interact with the work.The Guggenheim offered the work to US President Donald Trump during his first term in office after he had asked to borrow a Van Gogh painting.In 2019, it went on show at Blenheim Palace, the English country manor that was the birthplace of Winston Churchill. Within days, it was stolen by burglars who broke into the building, forcibly wrenched it from the plumbing, and fled. Two men were convicted earlier this year and jailed. The toilet has never been recovered. Investigators think it was likely broken up and melted down.Galperin is unwilling to speculate on how much ""America"" could sell for. He notes that Cattelan's duct-taped banana posed questions about ""how one assigns value to something that has, in essence, no value aside from its authorship and its conceptual idea.""'America' is in many ways the complete inverse of that. It is a perfect foil in that this work has a lot of intrinsic value in a way that most artworks do not,"" he said ""The question of the proportion of value between the raw materials and the artistic idea is very on the table here.""""America"" will go on display at Sotheby's new New York headquarters, the Breuer Building, from Nov 8 until the auction. It will be in a bathroom, and visitors will be able to see it up close and personal.At Guggenheim and Blenheim Palace, the toilet was connected to the plumbing system and visitors could book a 3-minute appointment to use it. This time, visitors won't be able to use it - they can look, but they can't flush.","Sotheby's will auction off the solid gold cistern, a sculpture by Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan.

Buckingham Palace announced that Prince Andrew would lose his prince title and vacate Royal Lodge in Windsor amid ongoing controversy over his links to paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein. The former duke agreed to surrender his remaining royal titles, including the Duke of York, earlier this month.The decision follows serious lapses in Andrew’s judgement, the palace said, although he continues to deny the accusations. It is understood he did not object to the King’s decision. The statement from Buckingham Palace in full:,"" the statement read, as per BBC news.,"" the statement added.Prince Andrew will be relocated to a property on the Sandringham Estate in Norfolk as soon as practicable after formal notice to surrender the lease at Royal Lodge was given on Thursday.Details of his specific accommodation have not been released. The wider Sandringham estate covers approximately 20,000 acres, including 600 acres of gardens, but the Palace has not said which property he will occupy.It is understood that Sarah Ferguson, 66, Andrew’s ex-wife, has also been asked to vacate Royal Lodge and will make her own living arrangements.The King will privately fund Andrew’s accommodation and will make “appropriate private provision” for his brother as he moves out of Royal Lodge.Earlier this week, the Public Accounts Committee wrote a letter detailing the “considerable and understandable public interest in the spending of public money” relating to Andrew. The letter asked what the Crown Estate’s plan was to ensure value for money in any future agreements with Andrew. Andrew is understood not to have objected to the King’s decision to remove his titles.The titles being stripped are Prince, Duke of York, Earl of Inverness and Baron Killyleagh. He will also lose the right to be called His Royal Highness and the honours of the Order of the Garter and Knight Grand Cross of the Victorian Order. His birth certificate will not be changed and the title change will not apply retrospectively.To remove the titles, the King will send Royal warrants to the Lord Chancellor, David Lammy. On 17 October, Andrew said he would stop using the titles because the “continued accusations about me distract from the work of His Majesty and the Royal Family”. “I vigorously deny the accusations against me,” he said.Princess Eugenie and Princess Beatrice will retain their titles, as they are the daughters of the son of a Sovereign. This is in line with King George V’s Letters Patent of 1917. Until this month, Ferguson kept the title Sarah, Duchess of York, but she reverted to her maiden name of Ferguson after Andrew was stripped of his Duke of York title.","Buckingham Palace announced that Prince Andrew would lose his prince title and vacate Royal Lodge in Windsor.

Prince William wants to lead a ‘monarchy for the modern age’ — here are 5 ‘totally outdated’ traditions he plans to scrap,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/prince-william-wants-to-lead-a-monarchy-for-the-modern-age-here-are-5-totally-outdated-traditions-he-plans-to-scrap/articleshow/124960710.cms,"The Reluctant Traveler

Prince Andrew’s Royal Lodge Lease Sparks U.K. Parliament Probe

1. Farewell to fancy outfits

2. Scrapping old ceremonial roles

3. Ending bowing and curtseying

4. Less house-hopping

5. Goodbye to gold-embossed stationery





Royal robes, swan keepers, and gold-embossed letters may soon be relics of the past if Prince William has his way. The future king is quietly sketching plans to modernise the monarchy, trimming away its “ridiculous” and “totally outdated” traditions to make the royal family more relatable to ordinary Britons. He has made it clear that he wants to lead “a monarchy fit for the modern age”, one with less pomp, fewer old-fashioned titles, and a stronger focus on purpose and people, according to Cosmopolitan.Speaking recently to actor Eugene Levy on, the Prince of Wales shared that “change for good” is on his “agenda.” He said, “I embrace that. I don’t fear it – that’s the bit that excites me, the idea of being able to bring some change. Not overly radical, but changes that I think need to happen.”His comments sparked curiosity about what exactly those changes might be.“William’s vision is a monarchy fit for the modern age – less pomp, fewer outdated titles, and a stronger emphasis on purpose,” a palace insider told. “He’s pragmatic about it. He knows the monarchy can only endure if it evolves and stays meaningful to people’s lives.One of the biggest changes William is said to favour involves the ceremonial outfits worn by royals during events such as the Order of the Garter.The insider said, “William can’t stand the more theatrical side of royal tradition.” They added that he finds parading around in velvet robes “medieval.”“William’s focus is on celebrating achievement, not ceremony. He wants the spotlight on those receiving honours, not on the royals in elaborate outfits,” the source said.William also reportedly wants to streamline centuries-old ceremonial roles that no longer serve a practical purpose. These include positions such as the Keeper of the Swans or the Yeoman of the Glass Pantry.“Some of these ceremonial positions haven’t had a real purpose in centuries,” the insider explained. “William values history, but he’s practical. He wants the royal household to operate smoothly – not to preserve traditions just for show.”Another royal protocol that could soon vanish is the long-standing practice of bowing and curtseying before members of the royal family. “William’s never been comfortable with all the bowing and curtsying,” said the insider. “He’d rather someone greet him naturally than follow old protocols.”According to the source, this shift is part of his plan to make the monarchy feel more “approachable and human.”Unlike his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, and father, King Charles, William does not plan to constantly move between royal estates. “William isn’t drawn to the idea of rotating between royal estates,” the insider said. “Windsor will be the home base, with Sandringham and Balmoral reserved for short stays.” The move, they added, reflects his wish for “stability for his family, not a life spent packing and unpacking. ”William is also modernising communication within his household. Rather than relying on traditional stationery or monogrammed notes, he reportedly prefers using digital tools. “He’s practical – he wants systems that function smoothly, not trappings designed to impress,” the insider shared, noting that he already uses WhatsApp to communicate with his staff.","Prince William has said he wants to make the royal family more relatable to ordinary Britons.

New influx of Ukrainian refugees?

Maksym: 'I came to do an apprenticeship'

: 'At 23 or 24, you're in a sort of buffer zone'

: 'They might lower the age of conscription'

Building a future in Germany





Almost 1.3 million Ukrainian refugees have come to Germany since Russia launched its war of aggression in February 2022. At the start of October 2025, the central register of foreign nationals recorded 1,293,672 individuals who had been granted temporary protection since the war began. Until recently, the majority were Ukrainian women with children or pensioners. Now, though, large numbers of men under the age of 22 have begun to arrive.This is because Ukraine's government has changed the rules on who is permitted to cross the border. Since August 28, restrictions have been lifted on men aged between 18 and 22 leaving the country. This has led to a huge rise in the number of Ukrainian men in this age group registering in Germany: From around 100 a week to almost 1,000, according to the German Interior Ministry.The Ukrainian Consulting Centre in Berlin confirmed that, since September, it has seen a big increase in the number of young men seeking its support.""Before that, young men in this age [group] were not so much represented among the people whom we help,"" said Elina Waehner, the centre's coordinator. She explains that the advice centre held more than 440 consultations in September, and that 13% of them were with young men in this category.It's a significant increase from the summer, when they made up only 0.1% of the total.Some of these young people go straight to the reception centre for immigrants, while others initially stay with friends or relatives in Germany. The advice center comments that the young men are unusual in that they have a ""relatively high level of education."" Most of them want to obtain temporary protection to secure their right to stay in Germany; then they can apply to study or look for a job.One of the young men who has seized the opportunity to leave Ukraine is 20-year-old Maksym from Kyiv. He recently arrived in Berlin, and it's the first time he has been abroad. Strolling across Alexanderplatz, in the heart of the city, he can hardly find words to express his feelings.""I'm completely overwhelmed!"" he says. ""I'm incredibly happy, because I clearly see that this is my ticket to the future.""Maksym has already applied for temporary protection and is currently in refugee accommodation. He wants to start by learning German, then study or work.""I came here to do an apprenticeship, if not as an electrical engineer, then in a profession that improves people's quality of life and makes this country better,"" he says.Maksym has been working as a courier in Kyiv for the past two years. His father died seven years ago, and he was living alone with his mother, who works as a cleaner. ""I also came to Germany to help my mother,"" Maksym explains.22-year-old Serhiy, who has also recently arrived in Germany, is originally from Donbas. He has been fleeing Russia's war in Ukraine since 2014. Back then, living just two kilometres from the airport in Donetsk, he experienced the start of the war at close quarters. He then moved to the city of Shakhtarsk in the region of Dnipopetrovsk. During his time at school, Serhiy regularly attended Protestant Church services, and also discovered his passion for producing and directing videos. He now works as a freelance motion designer.Serhiy says it was very difficult for him to make the decision to leave Ukraine. He said that the possibilities for men to leave the country are very limited, and it gets even more complicated if you are over 22. He realised that this was his last chance to travel abroad legally.""At 23 or 24, you're in a sort of buffer zone. You can't just go abroad, but you're not hiding either; meanwhile, army call-up is getting closer and closer,"" he says. In Ukraine, men can be deployed in the war against Russia once they reach the age of 25.Serhiy has friends in Germany who left Ukraine some time ago, which influenced his decision to come to Germany too. He's now settling in, filling out applications and looking for work so he can rent an apartment. Later, he would like to bring his family — his mother, brother, and sister — to join him. He doesn't want to go back to Ukraine for at least ten years. He's not homesick.""I've moved a lot, and unfortunately, I never really had a proper home,"" says Serhiy, who has moved six times since the war began in 2014.Eighteen-year-old Viktor from the village of Hryhorivka, south of Kyiv, came to Berlin with his girlfriend at the end of August. They have both applied for temporary protection. Viktor is able to continue to pursue his studies online at the Kyiv University of Culture, and he has dreams of becoming an actor.He initially wanted to go abroad before he turned 18, but he hesitated. Ultimately, he says, it was ""fear of war"" and ""fear of being conscripted"" that prompted him to leave. Though men under 25 currently aren't conscripted, he believes this could change any time.""I read reports that said the age of conscription might be lowered. In our country, all sorts of laws could be passed, including that you can be conscripted as young as 18,"" Viktor says.His parents still live in Ukraine; his mother works as a nurse, while his father has been unemployed for years, for health reasons. Viktor is finding it harder than anticipated to settle in Germany. He would like to learn German, then study at university, or find a job. But right now, he says, things are difficult: ""Everything is very bureaucratic here, and the language barrier is a problem.""Giving men under 22 permission to leave the country provoked a mixed reaction. Critics say Ukraine cannot afford to lose its young generation, especially in times of mobilisation. On social media, young men who leave the country are often reviled as ""deserters"" or ""traitors.""""All my friends in Ukraine are happy for me,"" says Maksym, adding: ""Not even the ones serving in the Ukrainian army have said I'm abandoning the country and ought to fight.""When he left Ukraine, Maksym says, there were only a few men his age on the bus. He comments that anyone taking this step sees it as an opportunity, but he said is prepared to return if integrating abroad proves too difficult. He believes that the things people learn in Germany can be put to good use if they do go back to Ukraine.Serhiy said there were eight other young men on his bus, and they were all very happy after they got through passport control.""Once we were through, everyone shouted: Hurrah, we did it!"" he says.Despite their different circumstances, all three young men — Maksym, Serhiy and Viktor — are keen to build a life for themselves in Germany. Surveys indicate that more than one in five Ukrainian teenagers now want to move abroad, while 52% want to stay in Ukraine.","Since August 28, restrictions have been lifted on men aged between 18 and 22 leaving the country.
