Govt considering holding 2-tier NEET-UG with dual organisers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-considering-holding-2-tier-neet-ug-with-dual-organisers/articleshow/111871455.cms,"NEW DELHI: Significant changes are anticipated for the undergraduate medical/dental entrance test, as the govt is considering dividing the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test-Undergraduate ( NEET-UG ) into a two-tier exam system, with dual organisers . Another major amendment likely is transitioning to a hybrid mode of delivery.According to govt sources, there are a number of options that are presently being weighed, even as the fate of the NEET-UG 2024 is to be decided by the Supreme Court which is hearing a bunch of petitions including pleas for cancellation and retest of the exam conducted on May 5, 2024, due to an alleged paper leak.Some of the changes under discussion involve overhauling NEET-UG to a two-tiered exam - preliminary and finals. According to sources in the knowledge of the developments, the number of candidates to be selected for the finals is likely to be four to five times the number of seats, and the eligibility cutoff will be determined based on the preliminary scores and the total number of seats.""There are also deliberations on whether the finals can be delivered on CBT mode, while continuing with pen-paper mode for the prelims. Another aspect being looked into is to engage separate agencies for prelims and finals . For example, if the preliminary test is conducted by the NTA, can the finals be entrusted to the National Board of Examinations (NBE)/ Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE)/ All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS)?"" said the senior govt official.This, according to the source, is to introduce multiple layers of security. ""In case there are doubts that some candidates did manage to sneak in via wrong means in the prelims as the numbers are getting bigger every year, it will be difficult to make the cut in the finals.""NEET was introduced in 2016 after a five-year legal battle when a constitution bench of the Supreme Court on April 11, 2016, struck down its 2013 judgment, thereby reviving the Centre's December 21, 2010, notification for holding a single common entrance test for MBBS/BDS courses in India. Since the first NEET conducted by CBSE on May 1, 2016, where 6 lakh aspirants attended, this year over 24 lakh registered and over 23 lakh appeared, making it one of the most competitive exams in the country, with a ratio of nearly 21 candidates per seat, and approximately 42 aspirants per govt seat.As in the latest edition, NEET-UG has courted controversies including accusations of paper leaks and other irregularities, including in the first edition in 2016 when there were pleas filed in the SC over the alleged compromise of the question paper in Uttarakhand.","The Supreme Court is hearing a bunch of petitions including pleas for cancellation and retest of the exam conducted on May 5, 2024, due to an alleged paper leak.

Monetisation of assets will take place to pay off the liabilities. In the interim of monetisation of assets and some bonds getting due, the sovereign guarantee bonds stand good. Government of India stands behind those bonds and there will be no default.”Speaking on the sidelines of the India Mobile Congress curtain-raiser event here, Scindia said despite delays, people should have “national pride” and patience in waiting for the upgradation as it is being done on indigenous technologies and not something which is sourced from foreign vendors.“Develop a sense of national pride… The easy for us would have been to pick up technologies (from global vendors), and do what others do. But we feel that India must not be just a supplier of services, but also of products. So, we chose the harder way, and decided to develop the India 4G stack ourselves.”A consortium of Tata-run Tejas and TCS and public sector C-DOT has been working on the complex technologies to develop 4G and 5G telecom infrastructure that will be deployed on BSNL and MTNL networks. “Let me guarantee. We are on track to deploy one lakh RANs (radio access networks) towards this effort.”Scindia said efforts of the govt have been to develop technologies within India which will be used not only for domestic use, but also for exports. “From hardly anything a decade back, export of telecom equipment last year was to the tune of Rs 20,000 crore.”The minister also said that the govt wants to be a facilitator in enabling the growth of the sector, against acting as a regulator. He said after leapfrogging and witnessing rapid growth in 5G, India is now working to be a leader in the development of 6G technologies. “A country that followed the world in 4G, walked with it in 5G, will now lead when it comes to 6G.”Scindia said that India is now working on encouraging the development of apps and solutions for 5G that would be deployed in rural areas.On cybersecurity, the minister said that as India develops on the digital front, there is a looming threat on the front of cyber security. “Wars today are not only fought on land, but also on the cloud.

NEW DELHI: A massive Microsoft outage disrupted life across the globe on Friday as several key services came to a grinding halt. In US, 911 services got impacted which led to grounding of all flights while Britain saw its biggest rail service and London Stock Exchange disrupted. In India also, over 200 flights were cancelled and airports across the country faced glitches due to the outage.Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said a CrowdStrike update , released on Thursday, was behind the outage. ""We are aware of this issue and are working closely with CrowdStrike and across the industry to provide customers technical guidance and support to safely bring their systems back online,"" Nadella posted.Not just the aviation sector but banking, media and medical were also impacted across the globe. After over seven hours of chaos, Microsoft finally managed to fix the bug, however people continued to suffer due to the residual impact. Here is how the events unfolded:The issue came to forefront when several Windows 365 users worldwide have reported experiencing the Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) error. This issue causes systems to suddenly shut down or restart, rendering them unusable. Complaints flooded forums like Reddit, where users are sharing their frustration over their PCs randomly restarting and switching to blue screen error mode. Forums were filled with posts where people expressed their troubles.Multiple Indian airlines , including SpiceJet, Indigo, Akasa Air, Vistara, Air India, and Air India Express, reported encountering technical challenges with more than 200 flights getting cancelled.SpiceJet shared on social media platform X, ""We are currently experiencing technical challenges with our service provider, affecting online services including booking, check-in, and manage booking functionalities.""Airports in New Delhi, Bengaluru, Chennai, and Mumbai also reported IT issues, temporarily affecting some services. While many airlines in India resorted to hand-written boarding passes and manual frisking, flights arcoss the world from Hong Kong to US were impacted.Brokerage firms in India faced technical issues, although stock exchanges remained unaffected. The NSE and BSE stated their operations were running smoothly. Traders at brokerages such as Nuvama Wealth Management, Edelweiss Mutual Fund, Motilal Oswal, IIFL Securities, 5Paisa Capital, and Angel Broking reported problems.London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) also faced technical snag but later reported that its data and systems were back up and running amid Microsoft's global outage.Meanwhile, some banks and financial services firms reported that employees and customers experienced difficulties accessing their systems following the outage. Barclays customers faced issues managing their accounts on the Smart Investor digital investing platform, while Allianz employees had trouble logging on to their computers.The Indian Ministry of Information Technology confirmed having communicated with Microsoft about the situation, which was later resolved.""MEITY is continually in touch with Microsoft, which in turn is actively working with impacted entities.

This even as Haridwar police has taken a cue from their Muzaffarnagar counterparts and have issued similar order for eateries on Kanwar route in the district.Nitish Kumar's JD(U), which is an ally of BJP in Bihar and whose support is crucial for the survival of the NDA government at the Centre, said this directive is against Prime Minister's philosophy of ""Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas"" for Indian society and also the NDA.""A Kanwar Yatra bigger than UP takes place in Bihar. No such order is in effect there. These prohibitions imposed by police in UP are in violation of Prime Minister Modi's spirit of 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas'. It will be good if the order is reviewed or taken back,"" JD(U) leader KC Tyagi said.Another Bihar ally of BJP, the Lok Janshakti Party, also opposed the move of UP police. ""I will absolutely … never support or encourage"" any divide in the name of caste or religion,"" Union minister and LJP chief Chirag Paswan said opposing the Muzaffarnagar police advisory.Paswan said he believes two classes of people – rich and poor – exist in the society and persons of different castes and religions fall in both categories. ""We need to bridge the gap between these two classes of people. It is every government's responsibility to work for the poor, which includes all sections of society such as Dalits, backwards, upper castes and Muslims as well. All are there. We need to work for them,"" the LJP chief added.And its not just allies in Bihar who are opposing the Kanwar advisory, the Rashtriya Lok Dal, which is a key partner of the BJP in Uttar Pradesh, has also objected to the police order.""Gandhiji, Chaudhary Charan Singh and other personalities have spoken about keeping religion and caste behind. Now, politicians are taking forward religion and caste forward in politics. I think the action is not correct. Why do you make someone write their name on street carts? They have the right to work ... This tradition is absolutely wrong,"" RLD national general secretary Trilok Tyagi said.""It is up to the customer, they can make purchases from wherever they want ... I would like to ask politicians - does consuming alcohol not corrupt you religiously? Does it happen only when you consume meat? So, why is there no prohibition on alcohol? Why do they not speak about alcohol? Because those who do business have a nexus, it is a game of the powerful. These small shops are set up by the poor. So, you are pointing fingers at them. I would demand that ban alcohol too,"" he added.Meanwhile, unfazed by the controversy triggered by the Muzaffarnagar police directive, cops of Haridwar in neighbouring Uttarakhand have issued similar order for eateries on Kanwar route in the district. Haridwar Police has warned of legal action against those who do not comply with the order.""Regarding the preparations for Kanwar, we have given general instructions to the hotels, dhabas, restaurants and hawkers on the Kanwar route that they will write the name of the owner on their shops and if they fail to do so, we will take legal action against them. Many times, a situation of dispute arises due to this, hence this decision has been taken by us,"" Haridwar SSP Padmendra Dobal said.The BJP had yesterday come down heavily on the opposition parties for objecting to the directive of Muzaffarnagar police. The BJP leaders cited the display of Halal certification for Muslims to justify the move and questioned why a decision that has been taken to protect the religious beliefs of Kanwar devotees was being opposed.BJP spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla had slammed those objecting to the police order and said: ""Display of Halal certification to ensure Muslims' religious feelings are not hurt = Peak Secularism. Request to ALL eateries to comply with law & make proper disclosures of name to ensure that Kanwariyas' Astha is not hurt by false information- Peak Bigotry.""BJP leader Amit Malviya had also hit out at the opposition. ""If food is a choice, and restaurants, including some MNCs, delivery apps, catering to Muslim sensibilities, prominently display Halal compliance certificates, then why should it be any different for fasting Hindus (Kanwar Yatris in this case), who may want to eat at a pure veg restaurant, where the likelihood of them being served Satvik food is higher? Is giving Hindus equal right to choice a sin?"" he had said in a post on X.The opposition parties have reacted strongly to the move calling it discriminatory.(With inputs from agencies)","UP police order directing eateries on Kanwar Yatra route to display names of owners and workers has divided the ruling National Democratic Alliance.

Centre could have consulted law panel before bringing in new criminal laws: Madras HC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/govt-should-have-consulted-law-panel-on-new-criminal-laws-hc/articleshow/111870858.cms,"Representational Image

CHENNAI: Centre should have consulted at least the law commission before rolling out three new sets of criminal laws to replace IPC, CrPC, and the Evidence Act from July 1, Madras HC said Friday while admitting DMK organising secretary R S Bharathi's writ petition seeking to declare them ""unconstitutional"".""The law commission exists only for such a purpose (to advise govt on legal matters),"" the division bench of Justice S S Sundar and Justice N Senthilkumar said.The bench wondered why Centre wanted to replace the original three laws when the changes it wanted could have been incorporated through amendments to the existing Acts. The new laws - Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, and Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam - might cause confusion and require special interpretation, delaying justice delivery, it said. ""The intention of the amendments might be good. But we are concerned with the delay it might cause,"" the bench said.Senior advocate N R Elango, representing Bharathi, contended that Parliament introduced and passed the new laws without any meaningful discussion. ""The laws go against the legitimate expectation of the citizens that laws touching upon their everyday life as victims or accused would be passed with an open mind and after an elaborate discussion,"" he said.""The new laws do not bring in any substantial changes but merely shuffle the existing sections, which were unnecessary and would cause great inconvenience and confusion to the people regarding its interpretation. Shuffling the sections would make it very difficult for the judges, advocates, law enforcement agencies, and the public to correlate the new provisions with the old provisions to search for precedents,"" Elango said.After Centre's counsel sought time to respond to the pleas, the bench adjourned the hearing by four weeks. HC also tagged the petition with other similar pleas challenging the new criminal laws.","Three new sets of criminal laws to replace IPC, CrPC, and the Evidence Act from July 1.

HYDERABAD: After wading through a stream in spate, climbing hills, and trekking 16km for over five hours, Allem Appaiah, district medical and health officer (DMHO) of Mulugu in Telangana, reached a remote hamlet in Wajedu mandal to deliver medicines , mosquito nets, and provisions to 11 tribal families .The reason Appaiah undertook the arduous journey was not just to deliver essentials to the Guthi Koya tribe families, but also to request them to shift to plains, he said.In a bid to understand their living conditions and day-to-day travails, Appaiah slept in the thanda in Penugolu village overnight on July 16. ""It is hazardous for the families to live there. It will be extremely difficult to provide them medical facilities if there is an emergency in this monsoon season,"" Appaiah told TOI. The thanda (settlement smaller than a village) is home to 39 people, including children below two years, who prefer to stay there.At the request of the district administration, out of the 151 families residing in the village, 140 families shifted to the plains over the years. The 11 remaining families, however, indicated that if they were given houses close to the road and land to cultivate, they may consider the offer to shift.Appaiah said by going to the place himself, he understood the difficulties health assistant Chinna Venkatesh, who goes there to deliver medicines, faces. On July 16, Appaiah set out from Mulugu and reached Wajedu. From there, he began the 16km trek . When TOI tried to contact him on July 16 night, his mobile was not accessible. ""That is because it is difficult to even get a mobile signal there. It is thus that I requested the Guthi Koya families to shift to the plains, but they do not seem interested,"" he said.To reach the thanda, Appaiah crossed Kanchera vagu (stream) at three places.

BENGALURU: The world witnessed an unprecedented IT outage over Thursday and Friday that affected almost every business from airlines to healthcare, financial markets and govt agencies running Microsoft computers.Flights were delayed or cancelled. Banks were unable to issue money. Some retailers had to shut outlets, some put up signs saying they could only accept cash as the biggest IT outage ever affected people around the world.Operations across broadcasters, banks, airports, and transportation suffered massive disruption.Hundreds of flights were cancelled and airports from Australia to US and UK, and India witnessed chaotic scenes.Reports suggest that operations were yet to normalise at several places as the world struggled to come to terms with the enormity of the disruption. The outage was not caused by a cyberattack, as was initially feared. It began with a routine software update from US cybersecurity company CrowdStrike. The firm's solutions are widely used by organisations using Microsoft's Windows operating system. CrowdStrike 's software, Falcon Sensor, is designed to protect computer systems from cyberattacks. However, a defect in its latest update for computers running Windows OS triggered the issue.Those logging into their systems saw what's called the Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) - an error message that's displayed when the operating system encounters a critical issue that it cannot recover from.Within hours, Microsoft and CrowdStrike identified the issue and deployed a fix. But systems already impacted needed to be set right with manual workarounds. Given the scale of computers impacted and limited IT staff in organisations, this was still work in progress in most large businesses on Friday.Paris Olympic Committee said the outage was slowing its operations but tickets sales were not affected. In UK, general physicians and pharmacies were hit hard and faced shutdowns.CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz on X said, ""We understand the gravity of the situation and are deeply sorry for the inconvenience and disruption. We are working with all impacted customers to ensure that systems are back up and they can deliver the services their customers are counting on. He also apologised for the massive disruption saying, ""We are deeply sorry.""Sundareshwar K, partner and leader for cyber security at consultancy firm PwC India, said, ""This is a Black Swan event impacting not just businesses but the overall national machinery, and underscores how safeguarding entities against risk involves much more than technology. This development highlights how it is a misnomer that enhanced technology deployment alone will help organisations become more secure and ensure business continuity.""Back home, the enormity of the outage was felt across industries with airlines issuing handwritten boarding passes.IndiGo flyer Akshay Kothari took to X to share a photograph of his handwritten boarding pass for a Hyderabad-Kolkata flight. ""I got my first handwritten boarding pass today,"" he said. Indian carriers, including Indigo, Akasa Air, Air India Express, and SpiceJet, encountered glitches that impacted services including ticket booking and web check-in.Tata Starbucks, sources said, faced issues with some of its PoS (point of sale) systems, but there was no major impact on the business. Some sellers on Amazon, Meesho and Flipkart faced glitches with their inventory management systems supported by Microsoft, an executive with one of the firms said on condition of anonymity. Amazon and Flipkart did not respond to queries, while a Meesho spokesperson said there had been no impact.PhonePe's stock broking platform Share.market faced issues during the day.

UPSC has issued probationary IAS officer Puja Khedkar a show-cause notice, asking why her candidature in the 2022 civil services exam should not be cancelled, in which case she would cease to be part of the IAS and be barred from all future competitive exams, report Rajshekhar Jha & Bharti Jain.Delhi crime branch will also investigate how Khedkar got an MBBS seat at Pune's Shrimati Kashibai Navale Medical College by availing reservation in the ' Nomadic Tribe-3 ' category.Based on UPSC's complaint, police have slapped IPC sections 420 (cheating), 464 (making a document in the name of a fictitious person), 465 (forgery) and 471 (passing off a forged document as genuine) on Puja. She additionally faces charges under sections 89 and 91 of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act and 66D of the Information Technology Act.Officials said IPC had been invoked as the alleged offences were committed before the new criminal laws took effect on July 1.""UPSC has conducted a detailed and thorough investigation into the misdemeanour of Puja Manorama Dilip Khedkar...She fraudulently availed attempts beyond the permissible limit under the examination rules by faking her identity by way of changing her name, her father's and mother's names, her photograph/signature, her email ID, mobile number and address,"" UPSC said.In 2021, Khedkar cleared the mains and was supposed to undergo a medical test at AIIMS, which she allegedly ran away from to avoid being caught faking disability. ""The next year, she again appeared for the exam, using a fake certificate. Even before the results appeared, she applied for UPSC 2023,"" an officer said, quoting from UPSC's complaint.The complaint alleges that Khedkar showed her parents Dilip and Manorama Khedkar as having separated, so that their assets could be segregated and she could apply for a fake income certificate. Manorama was arrested Thursday in a different criminal case.An official said the inquiry being conducted by the department of personnel and training (DoPT) into Khedkar's candidature was on track and the report should be ready in two weeks. The DoPT committee's report is likely to echo the findings of UPSC's investigation into Khedkar's ""misdemeanours"", including the false OBC and disability claims that paved the way for her entry into the civil services.""UPSC stringently adheres to its constitutional mandate, and conducts all its processes, including all examinations, with the highest possible order of due diligence without any compromise. The commission is unequivocally committed to ensure that such high order of trust and credibility remains intact and uncompromised,"" the agency said in its press statement.In her first reaction to the FIR , Khedkar told reporters in Pune the ""judiciary will take its course"".","Puja Khedkar is a probationary IAS officer.

Their daytime biting behavior increases the risk of these infections in populated areasThis test detects the genetic material (RNA) of the Zika virus in blood, urine, or other body fluids. It is most effective when performed within the first week after visible symptomsWHO recommends sexually active men and women be counselled and offered a full range of contraceptive methods to be able to make an informed choice and prevent possible adverse pregnancy and fetal outcomesZika virus is also transmitted from mother to foetus during pregnancy, as well as through sexual contact, transfusion of blood and blood products, and possibly through organ transplantation: Dengue, chikungunya and Zika have more or less similar symptoms. Unfortunately, we are not testing for chikungunya and Zika as much as we should. 80% Zika infections are asymptomatic, while only 20% are symptomatic. When patient presents with symptoms suggestive of these infections, we test them only for dengue, which comes back negative. Then we have to treat them empirically and rule out any complications. All these three viruses are neurotrophic viruses, which can affect the brain and the spinal cord in a minority of patients. While authorities are right in testing pregnant patients especially in first trimester for Zika infection, they must work on widening the scope of testing to truly address the spread of the virus.Civic bodies have not been able to keep pace with maintaining hygiene to minimize breeding. Fogging and chemical spraying is not the answer. Source reduction by proper garbage clearance and community level awareness are key.Rampant construction, which forms breeding spots is the main cause for increase in mosquitoes today. We need a dedicated campaign to destroy such areas. Awareness drives are crucial, too. Our civic bodies also need more health infrastructure.: There are innumerable breeding grounds across the city and lack of information plays a big role in spread of the virus. There are a lot of misconceptions about if transmission, which can be resolved only through a stronger public health awareness structure. If detected, close follow up and regular scans is the only way to ensure it does not cause neurological or other issues — Dr Devashish Desai | consultant for infectious diseases, ruby hall clinicTo prevent spread of vector-borne diseases, we must address root causes like over-concretization, which create breeding grounds; climate change, which extends breeding seasons; and the destruction of ecosystems that naturally control mosquito populations. Sustainable development is keyFor the past few years, multiple variants of the virus have been making the rounds and there is a lot of panic around its spread. We must stay alert, practice self-care and work on boosting our immunity. We must also ensure that are surroundings are free of breeding spots, take necessary precautions and try to create awareness in our neighbourhoods —I have observed that there is a lot of concern in areas like Kothrud, but otherwise there is complacency among citizens and authorities. There are still scores of places where rain water continues to accumulate. Personally, I feel that the authorities are not taking this menace seriously",Citizens and experts say the civic body has not done its job. There’s been hardly any fogging this season and vector surveillance is poor. This has led to a huge increase in mosquito numbers. Public health measures like source reduction and awareness campaigns recommended to control the outbreak.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111853417,imgsize-109038,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/111853417.jpg"

Trump's marriage with Melania is the longest for Trump -- his marriage with Ivana lasted for 15 years, with Marla Maples around five years and with Melania 19 years.According to reports, it is their prenuptial agreement that has made their marriage strong.Ivana after divorcing Trump got $14 million, an apartment in New York, a mansion in Connecticut, access to Mar-a-Lago once a year, in addition to $650,000 a year in alimony and child support in their divorce. Marla Maples got $2m.The Independent in an article delving deep into Trump-Melania relationship reported that Melania renegotiated a new postnup agreement ahead of Trump's presidential bid -- and it was the third time that her marital agreement terms were renegotiated. The third one was necessitated because of Trump's legal woes.The updated agreement centers around money and property as Melania is most concerned about maintaining and increasing a substantial trust for her son Barron Trump -- who for the first time made a political appearance at father's rally.According to the new agreement, Trump would provide a more solid future for Melania and Barron if there's a divorce. The agreement reportedly has a specific amount of money that Barron is supposed to get.The Independent report noted that if Donald Trump and Melania get divorced during the election and Trump is elected, he is entitled to assign a non-romantic partner to the role of the first lady.Melania has hosted private fundraisers but remained absent from the election scene. She was not even there at the CNN debate.

The only way to ensure that the system works properly is to ensure that good technology is brought into the system,"" added Justice Manmohan.The pilot hybrid court utilizes advanced technologies, including 'Automatic Speech Recognition' and 'Large Language Models', to convert spoken words into text efficiently. This digital transition is set to be a powerful tool and a potential game-changer in legal proceedings.Justice Manmohan pointed out the multifunctional aspect of this technology, indicating that it addresses the acute shortage of stenographers in courts.He shared the ongoing struggle to meet the demands for stenographers and suggested that the new system could alleviate this issue significantly.""As a chief justice, the biggest problem that I face is that all judges are requesting a large number of stenographers, and there is not enough pool available. I think this will solve the problem to a large extent because once the speech-to-text facility is available, especially with regard to the recording of evidence by the joint registrars and by the district judiciary, this will ensure that quite a big pool of stenographers becomes available for other purposes,"" he said.The event also saw the launch of a 'digital court application' designed to enhance judicial processes by providing judicial officers access to all e-filed cases.This desktop application comes with functions such as document uploads to ensure all physical documents presented in court are also digitally available in the Case Information System (CIS).Justice Manmohan praised the IT Committee led by Justice Rajiv Shakdhar, attributing the committee's hard work and dedication to the success of this initiative.He also acknowledged that there are financial constraints and priorities that need to be balanced to expand these technological advancements further.""We require a lot more finances. Naturally, the state has its own priorities. So there is a bit of a tussle, or there is a bit of an argument over it, and we have to resolve it,"" he said.Justice Manmohan expressed concerns regarding the misuse of technology, warning that it is often employed to violate laws.He stressed the importance of using technology correctly to combat such violations and to bring people in conformity with the law.""Today, when I sit in court and decide matters, one of the things that strikes me is that technology is being used to circumvent the laws, to break the laws, to promote infringement.The only way we can deal with violations and bring people in conformity with the law is again to use technology in the right way,"" he added.Efforts are underway to develop hybrid court facilities in all 691 district courtrooms in Delhi, with a budget allocation of approximately Rs 387 crore. Fourteen pilot projects are currently in the pipeline.The inauguration event was attended by several esteemed members of the judiciary and legal fraternity, including Justice Suresh Kumar Kait, Justice Rajiv Shakdhar, Justice Purushaindra Kumar Kaurav, Justice Sanjeev Narula, Justice Tushar Rao Gedela, Justice Girish Kathpaliya, Principal District and Sessions Judge (Headquarters) Sanjay Garf, Principal District and Sessions Judge (West) Vinod Kumar, Senior Advocate Mohit Mathur, President of the Delhi High Court Bar Association, and Nitin Ahlawat, president of the Delhi bar association.","The pilot hybrid court utilizes advanced technologies, including 'Automatic Speech Recognition' and 'Large Language Models', to convert spoken words into text efficiently.

NEW DELHI: Delhi Police busted another kidney racket in the city on Friday, arresting 15 individuals, among them alleged transplant coordinators, recipients and donors. The gang is believed to have had kidney transplants carried out in 11 hospitals in various states, with 34 cases of illegal transplants now listed.""A woman filed a complaint stating that her husband paid Rs 35 lakh to one Sandeep Arya and one Vijay Kumar Kashyap for a kidney transplant but wasn't provided one,"" a police officer said.To investigate the matter, Sanjay Bhatia, additional commissioner of police (Crime), formed a team led by ACP Raman Lamba with sub-inspectors Rakesh and Ankit. ""The team conducted a raid in Noida, nabbed Kashyap and recovered numerous fabricated papers, stamp seals and files of patients and donors. The team also apprehended Arya and Devender from a five-star hotel in Goa,"" said Bhatia.The investigation revealed that some gang members worked in reputed hospitals as transplant coordinators, thus learning about the kidney transplant processes employed by those hospitals. After that, they identified patients undergoing treatment for kidney disease in hospitals in Delhi, Faridabad, Mohali, Panchkula, Agra, Indore and Vadodara.The accused contacted potential donors, often from impoverished families, through social media and promised them Rs 5-6 lakh per kidney. Forged documents were created to portray the patients and donors as close relatives, a mandatory requirement under India's organ transplant laws . After preliminary medical examination, arrangements were made for the donors to pass the scrutiny of the transplant authorisation committeein different hospitals. The investigation led to five more people being arrested: Puneet Kumar, Mohammad Hanif Shaikh, Cheeka Prashanth, Tej Prakash and Rohit Khanna. Five patients who were kidney recipients and two donors were also identified and legal action has been initiated against them too.The racket was run by Arya, an MBA graduate, who had worked as a transplant coordinator in hospitals in Faridabad, Delhi, Gurgaon, Indore and Vadodara. He contacted patients and arranged kidney transplants in the hospitals he worked in. He charged Rs 35-40 lakh for each kidney transplant procedure, including the hospital expenses, arrangement of the donor, accommodation and the legal documentation required for surgery. He made Rs 7-8 lakh for himself from each transplant.Arya and his brother-in-law, Devender, were the ones who cheated the patient whose complaint brought the case to the notice of police. Kashyap was one of the gang members, while Kumar prepared the fake documents confirming a relationship between the patient and the donor.Hanif Shaikh, a tailor, donated his kidney for money and subsequently became involved in the transplant racket, as did Prashanth, who donated a kidney before he began working for the gang. With his help, Arya facilitated three kidney transplants.Prakash obtained a kidney transplant for his wife, while Khanna acquired contact numbers of kidney donors through social media platforms. The latter possessed 26 email IDs, operated several social media pages and was a member of 112 kidney-treatment groups. He is the primary supplier of donors to the syndicate.","The gang is believed to have had kidney transplants carried out in 11 hospitals in various states.

He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said.

Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.",Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

But issues continued to cascade throughout the day, affecting package delivery, hospitals, courthouses and various other sectors worldwide.The outage was attributed to a software update issued by CrowdStrike , a cybersecurity firm whose software is used by myriad industries around the world.The disruption, which reached what some experts called ""historic"" proportions, was a stunning example of the global economy's fragile dependence on certain software, and the cascading effect it can have when things go wrong.A software update issued by CrowdStrike resulted in crashes of machines running the Microsoft Windows operating system. George Kurtz, the company's CEO, said it was not a security incident or cyberattack. He said a fix had been sent out, but warned it could take some time to implement. ""We're deeply sorry for the impact that we've caused,"" he said.Early on Friday, major US airlines - American Airlines , Delta Air Lines and United Airlines - grounded flights, while other carriers and airports around the world reported delays and disruptions.

Usha Vance's RNC speech on Indian heritage amidst 'send them back' chants a stark contradiction,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/why-is-usha-vance-being-accused-of-hypocrisy-after-her-rnc-speech/articleshow/111875648.cms,"Usha Chilukuri Vance on Wednesday spoke proudly about her Indian roots and immigrant parents at the Republican National Convention .However, social media users criticised her for what they perceive as a glaring inconsistency: the strongly anti-immigrant sentiment prevalent among the audience she addressed.Talking about her Indian roots, Usha had said, 'I grew up in San Diego in a middle-class community with two loving parents both immigrants from India and a loving sister.'Throughout the event, signs reading ""Mass Deportations Now"" dotted the convention floor, and chants of ""send them back"" echoed multiple times when politicians, including Usha Vance's husband, JD Vance, spoke about ""illegal aliens"" entering the country.According to experts, this contradiction confirms a long-standing strategy employed by the right. Pawan Dhingra, an American studies professor at Amherst College, explained to NBC, ""There are good immigrants and there are bad immigrants. And the Republican Party is just trying to embrace, quote-unquote, 'good immigrants.'"" During her speech, Usha Vance discussed her upbringing and how it differed from her husband's, emphasizing the American Dream and how their love story exemplifies it.“Usha Vance talking about being a daughter of immigrants as the mostly white people at the RNC hold ‘Mass Deportations Now’ signs is quite the scene,” one person tweeted.Businessman and former GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy also invoked his family's immigrant story during his speech, along with a more explicit message about undocumented immigrants. ""Our message to every legal immigrant in this country is this: You're like my parents,"" he said. ""You deserve the opportunity to secure a better life for your children in America. But our message to illegal immigrants is also this: We will return you to your country of origin.""Dhingra argued that this rhetoric is particularly damaging when expressed by children of immigrants like Ramaswamy and Usha Vance, as it creates a division between communities of colour whose stories are similar. He noted that the binary of good and bad immigrants is nonsensical, as the government's arbitrary limits on legal immigration often contribute to the creation of undocumented immigration.When asked about the criticism, JD Vance's adviser and family friend, Jai Chabria, and Trump campaign communications director Steven Cheung dismissed it as an attack on a successful diverse figure by out-of-touch liberals. However, experts point out that JD Vance's political transformation and stances on immigration put him at odds with his wife's immigrant family story.Despite speeches denouncing undocumented immigrants, Trump's presidency saw the restriction of legal immigration pathways, affecting foreign-born workers, particularly Indian nationals who make up the majority of H1B petitioners.As a new face of the MAGA movement, Usha Vance may have a unique role in addressing these issues, with Dhingra suggesting that her presence could support the Republican Party's rhetoric that they are not anti-immigrant but rather want immigrants to ""adapt"" to the country properly without threatening certain ways of life.","Usha Chilukuri Vance spoke proudly about her Indian roots and immigrant parents at the Republican National Convention.
