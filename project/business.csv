"Oppn accuses Centre of neglecting states ruled by rivals, attaches motive to Fin Bill",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/oppn-accuses-centre-of-neglecting-states-ruled-by-rivals-attaches-motive-to-fin-bill/articleshow/119450405.cms,"With inputs from Mohua Chatterjee

NEW DELHI: Opposition MPs on Monday attacked the Centre over alleged neglect of the states ruled by rival parties .""...the five southern states - Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka and Telangana - are among India's strongest economic engines. They are paying taxes. They generate over a quarter of the country's direct taxes. They contribute 28.5% of GST. But when it comes to receiving their fair share, they get a mere 15% of the Centre's tax pool. How is this acceptable?"" asked Shashi Tharoor, Congress MP from Thiruvananthapuram.Initiating the debate on the Finance Bill in Lok Sabha, Tharoor claimed that the bill was yet another move by the Centre to hoard revenue at the states' expense by slashing basic customs duty on several items which are shared with states and shifting the difference to the Agricultural Infrastructure and Development Cess (AIDC), which the Centre keeps entirely.The Thiruvananthapuram MP demanded the constitution of an independent fiscal council to serve as a redressal body, ensuring that the States have a say in how their hard-earned revenue is allocated.DMK MP Kalanidhi Veeraswamy alleged BJP-led Centre presented the Finance Bill for announcing tax exemption for those earning up to Rs 12 lakh in view of the Delhi elections. ""They have achieved their aim and won in the Delhi assembly elections. So, I would like to congratulate them on their efforts,"" Veeraswamy said, in a sarcastic manner, and went on to add that Tamil Nadu does not get its fair share from tax collected by the Centre.""If you look at the statistics over the last 10 years, Tamil Nadu has paid about Rs 8 lakh crore in the form of direct taxes, but the devolution which has come back to Tamil Nadu is only about Rs. 2.4 lakh crore. The amount of Rs.5.6 lakh crore has been utilised by the union govt where it has been disbursed to other states like UP, Bihar, and other less performing States,"" the Chennai North MP said. He also raised the issue of implementation of the NE.Punjab MP Harsimrat Kaur Badal said there wasn't a single mention in the budget about MSP ( Minimum Support Price ) - an issue for which farmers from the state have been agitating for months.TMC MP Abhishek Banerjee accused the Centre of withholding Rs 2 lakh crore in funds due to West Bengal, making it a key campaign issue for the upcoming state elections. He said BJP's actions had previously backfired, citing TMC's 2021 victory. TMC plans to intensify its campaign on the issue and has set up grassroots committees to prevent electoral fraud by verifying voter rolls, with training camps for supervisors set to conclude by April 30.","Opposition MPs attack the Centre over alleged neglect of the states ruled by rival parties.

'I will not apologise': Kunal Kamra takes shot at 'mob & politicians' in first reaction to 'gaddar' joke row,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/i-will-not-apologise-kunal-kamra-takes-shot-at-mob-politicians-in-first-reaction-to-gaddar-joke-row/articleshow/119435880.cms,"Kunal Kamra (ANI)

NEW DELHI: Stand-up comedian Kunal Kamra on Monday responded to the controversy sparked by his show at Mumbai's Habitat Studio . ""I will not apologise,"" Kamra asserted in his first reaction, taking aim at the ""mob and politicians"" over the backlash to his joke.The uproar stemmed from a segment where he parodied a popular Hindi song from Dil Toh Pagal Hai, referring to Eknath Shinde as a ""gaddar"" (traitor).The incident led to chaotic protests and vandalism by Shinde-led Sena party workers.Taking to X, Kamra posted a series of statements addressing people involved in it. Targeting ""mob"" for studio's vandalism, Kamra said, ""An entertainment venue is merely a platform. A space for all sorts of shows. Habitat (or any other venue) is not responsible for my comedy, nor does it have any power or control over what I say or do. Neither does any political party.""""Our right to freedom of speech and expression is not only to be used to fawn over the powerful and rich even though today's media would have us believe otherwise,"" he added in his response to the ""political leaders"".Kamra further questioned whether the law would be applied equally to those who vandalised the venue, stating: ""However, I am willing to co-operate with the police and courts for any lawful action taken against me. But will the law be fairly and equally deployed against those who have decided that vandalism is the appropriate response to being offended by a joke? And against the unelected members of the BMC, who have arrived today at Habitat, without prior notice, and tore the place down with hammers? Perhaps for my next venue, I will opt for Elphinstone bridge, or any other structure in Mumbai that's in need of speedy demolition.""Addressing those leaking his personal contact details, he said: ""To those who are busy leaking my number or calling me incessantly: I am sure you've realised by now that all unknown calls go to my voicemail, where you will be subjected to the very song that you hate. To the media faithfully reporting this circus: Remember that press freedom in India ranks at 159. I will not apologise. What I said is exactly what Mr Ajit Pawar (1st deputy CM) said about Mr Eknath Shinde (2nd Deputy CM). I don't fear this mob & I will not be hiding under my bed, waiting for this to die down.""Meanwhile, Maharashtra's junior home minister, Yogesh Kadam, announced in the state assembly that Kamra's call records and financial transactions would be examined.""Call recordings along with CDRs, as well as bank statements of comedian Kunal Kamra, will also be checked.

Trump announces 25% tariff on countries buying Venezuelan oil - How it will impact India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/trump-announces-25-tariff-on-countries-buying-venezuelan-oil-how-it-will-impact-india/articleshow/119433171.cms,"Key figures regarding India's oil/gas imports from Venezuela:

December 2023: India imported approximately 191,600 barrels per day (bpd). Reliance Industries received around 127,000 bpd, while Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) and HPCL-Mittal Energy received approximately 37,000 bpd and 28,000 bpd, respectively.

January 2024: India's imports rose to over 254,000 bpd, which was nearly half of Venezuela's total oil exports of almost 557,000 bpd for the month.

President Donald Trump said on Monday he would levy a 25 percent tariff across the board on any country buying oil or gas from Venezuela, as he escalated trade wars with a number of US foes and allies.""Venezuela has been very hostile to the United States and the Freedoms which we espouse,"" he wrote on his Truth Social network. ""Therefore, any Country that purchases Oil and/or Gas from Venezuela will be forced to pay a Tariff of 25% to the United States on any Trade they do with our Country.""In December 2023 and January 2024, India became the top buyer of Venezuelan crude oil. In 2024, India imported 22 million barrels of oil from Venezuela, which made up 1.5% of India's total crude oil purchases.Announcing the new tarrif, Trump said on his Truth Social platform: ""President Donald J. Trump announced today that the United States of America will be putting what is known as a Secondary Tariff on the Country of Venezuela, for numerous reasons, including the fact that Venezuela has purposefully and deceitfully sent to the United States, undercover, tens of thousands of high level, and other, criminals, many of whom are murderers and people of a very violent nature. Among the gangs they sent to the United States, is Tren de Aragua, which has been given the designation of “Foreign Terrorist Organization.” We are in the process of returning them to Venezuela — It is a big task! In addition, Venezuela has been very hostile to the United States and the Freedoms which we espouse.""""Therefore, any Country that purchases Oil and/or Gas from Venezuela will be forced to pay a Tariff of 25% to the United States on any Trade they do with our Country.

MP salary over the years

Constituency allowance, office expenses of MPs also up

NEW DELHI: The govt on Monday notified a 24% increase in salaries of members of Parliament (MPs), with effect from April 1, 2023, on the basis of the cost inflation index, taking their monthly remuneration to Rs 1.24 lakh from Rs 1 lakh earlier.In a notification, the parliamentary affairs ministry said the daily allowance for sitting members, and pension and additional pension for every year of service in excess of five years for former members, have also been increased.While the daily allowance has been increased from Rs 2,000 to Rs 2,500, pension for former MPs has been increased from Rs 25,000 per month to Rs 31,000 per month, it said. Daily allowance can be drawn by MPs while attending Parliament sessions and parliamentary committee meetings.The additional pension for every year of service in excess of five years has been increased from Rs 2,000 per month to Rs 2,500 per month.Now, an MP will get Rs 1.24 lakh per month as salary, Rs 87,000 per month as constituency allowance as against Rs 70,000 earlier, and Rs 75,000 towards office expenses as against Rs 60,000 earlier. In the last revision in 2018, MPs’ salary was increased from Rs 50,000 to Rs 1 lakh.Govt had put in place a sys- tem for automatic revision of salaries and allowances every five years by indexing it to in- flation — doing away with the practice of MPs making recom- mendations for fixing salaries.During the Covid pandemic in 2020, govt slashed salaries of MPs and ministers by 30% for one year. Congress MP Harish Meena questioned the real gain that salary hike will bring to parliamentarians.He argued the pre-hike salary of Rs 12 lakh was within the IT exemption brack- et while the increase of Rs 24,000 has brought the salary in the tax slab.Bharat Adivasi Party MP Rajkumar Roat said he was happy with the increase in salary but govt should increase MPLADS fund to Rs 5 crore, as is available to MLAs in Rajasthan. He said MPs have to spend a lot of money in travel and catering to various emergencies in their constituencies, and the salary hike would provide some relief in view of price rise.","Daily allowance for sitting members, and pension and additional pension for every year of service in excess of five years for former members, have also been increased.

'Impeach Justice Varma ... will not tolerate transfer': Allahabad HC Bar chief on cash row,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/impeach-justice-varma-will-not-tolerate-transfer-allahabad-hc-bar-chief-on-cash-row/articleshow/119427064.cms,"Allahabad HC Bar association president and Justice Varma (R)

'Step in the right direction': Dhankhar praises CJI



'Not a trash bin'



NEW DELHI: The Allahabad HC Bar association has strongly opposed the Supreme Court's decision to transfer Justice Yashwant Varma from Delhi high court to Allahabad high court, amid the recovery of a substantial amount of cash from his official residence after a fire incident on March 14.After a general house meeting in Prayagraj on Monday, Anil Tiwari, Allahabad HC Bar president, condemned the move and demanded further action. ""We have passed 11 proposals. First, we will not tolerate his (Justice Yashwant Varma) transfer here under any circumstances; it did not happen today, nor should it happen in the future,"" he said.He further urged the CJI to allow investigating agencies to take action. ""We request the Chief Justice of India to permit the CBI and ED to file an FIR against him and conduct a trial, as is done for any political leader or bureaucrat, since the incident is not part of any judicial function.""Tiwari also called for impeachment proceedings against Justice Varma. ""We have requested the government to initiate the impeachment process, which should proceed as soon as possible to prevent any attempts to destroy evidence. We have also questioned the appointment system, stating that it is unfair. The collegium system only provides opportunities to well-connected individuals.""The Supreme Court Collegium, led by the CJI Sanjiv Khanna along with four senior-most judges, issued a resolution recommending Justice Varma’s transfer back to his parent court, the Allahabad high court.The Collegium reviewed the transfer proposal on March 20. The top court has clarified that the transfer is unrelated to the in-house inquiry initiated by the Chief Justice of the Delhi high court regarding the cash recovery.Rajya Sabha chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar praised CJI Khanna for upholding judicial transparency amid the ongoing controversy.Dhankhar mentioned that, for the first time since Independence, a Chief Justice has publicly disclosed all relevant material without withholding any information.""This is a step in the right direction. The formation of a committee by the Chief Justice and his vigilance are also noteworthy. Institutions like the judiciary and legislature function best when their internal mechanisms are efficient, prompt, and uphold public trust,"" he added.This is not the first time the Allahabad HC Bar association has opposed the transfer. Last week, it wrote to Chief Justice Arun Bhansali, stating that the Allahabad HC is ""not a trash bin."" The association linked the decision to broader concerns about the judicial appointment and transfer system, arguing that it had weakened public faith in the rule of law.Justice Yashwant Varma, in his response to the inquiry panel, has denied any wrongdoing, calling the allegations an attempt to malign him. In a letter to the Chief Justice of the Delhi HC, he stated that neither he nor his family had any connection to the cash allegedly discovered at the site.","The Allahabad HC Bar association has strongly opposed the Supreme Court's decision to transfer Justice Yashwant Varma.

NEW DELHI: Two months after it conducted searches on the premises of a railway claims tribunal judge in Patna, R K Mittal, and his associates in a case of Rs 50 crore fraudulent withdrawal of death compensations, ED on Friday attached 24 properties belonging to the accused.This was not the first time the agency had acted against a judge accused of alleged bribery or association with fraudsters engaged in fixing benches and cultivating judges for favourable judgments. Apart from the known instances, the agency is also learned to be keeping a close surveillance on conflicts of interest of judges and alleged efforts to bribe them.On Aug 10 in 2023, ED arrested Panchkula's former special court judge Sudhir Parmar in connection with alleged bribery and for favouring accused in a money laundering case against real estate developer IREO and its promoter Lalit Goyal.Goyal was arrested by the agency just a month before it took Parmar into custody. Panchkula's special CBI court judge was suspended by Punjab and Haryana high court in April that year after agencies produced ""incriminating evidence"" against him for allegedly favouring the IREO promoters accused in a money laundering investigation .ED later arrested Goyal's associates and promoters of M3M, Basant Bansal and Pankaj Bansal, in a separate case. ED in its remand note had claimed that ""Sudhir Parmar (the Panchkula judge) was showing favouritism to the accused Roop Bansal, his brother Basant Bansal, the owners of M3M, and Lalit Goyal, the owner of IREO Group, in lieu of undue advantages"".In yet another case, while probing the Chhattisgarh PDS scam pertaining to the period of the previous Congress-led govt of Bhupesh Baghel, ED came across evidence of alleged liaisoning between two senior IAS officers who were accused in the case and a judge of the Chhattisgarh high court influencing the trial.ED brought the issue to the notice of Supreme Court, which transferred the judge in question to Patna high court, an action similar to what the SC collegium had proposed in case of a judge of Delhi high court after alleged recovery of a huge pile of cash from his residence.In the case of Chhattisgarh HC judge, as reported by TOI, ED had told SC that two IAS officers, Anil Tuteja and Alok Shukla, ""were in touch with the high court judge who granted bail to Shukla"". The agency further alleged that the then advocate general of the state had been liaising between the two accused and the judge, indirectly alleging quid pro quo in relief granted to the babus under investigation in the PDS scam.","Two months after it conducted searches on the premises of a railway claims tribunal judge in Patna, R K Mittal, and his associates, ED attached 24 properties belonging to the accused.

NEW DELHI: India will now for the first time conduct a major naval exercise called `Aikeyme’ with 10 African countries, as part of the continuing military outreach to the continent where China has made major strategic inroads, even as it keeps a close watch on the threats posed by Somali pirates and Houthi rebels in the region.The Navy will next month also launch another maiden initiative called `Indian Ocean ship (IOS) Sagar’, under which a combined crew of Indian sailors and 44 personnel from nine friendly foreign countries will man offshore patrol vessel INS Sunayna during her deployment to the south-west Indian Ocean Region (IOR) from April m5 to May 8.“Over the past 10 years, the Indian Navy has deepened its partnerships with navies and agencies of IOR countries to enhance maritime security in consonance with the govt’s vision of `Sagar’ (security and growth for all in the region),” Navy deputy chief Vice Admiral Tarun Sobti on Monday.“With the announcement of `Mahasagar’ (mutual and holistic advancement for security across the regions) by the PM during his visit to Mauritius in March, Aikeyme and IOS Sagar -- first of their kind initiatives -- are aimed at consolidating India’s stature as the ‘preferred security partner’ and `first responder in the IOR,” he said.While attacks by Somali pirates and Houthi rebels in the region have receded since Dec, an Indian warship is permanently deployed in the Gulf of Aden and adjoining seas, and more will be sent if piracy gains “ascendancy” again, the deputy chief added.The multi-nation Aikeyme exercise, or the `Africa-India key maritime engagement’, will be conducted off Dar-es-Salaam in Tanzania from April 13 to 18. “We are looking to make the exercise a biennial endeavour. This time it includes east African countries. In the next edition, we will invite west African countries as well to make it a larger African exercise,” Vice Admiral Sobti said.The countries taking part in Aikeyme, which will be inaugurated by defence minister Rajnath Singh, include Tanzania (which is co-hosting it), the Comoros, Djibouti, Eritrea, Kenya, Madagascar, Mauritius, Mozambique, Seychelles and South Africa.The exercise will focus on VBSS (visit board search and seizure) drills, arms firings, helicopter operations, seamanship evolutions, search and rescue missions, among others. “There will also be table-top and command post exercises on anti-piracy operations and information-sharing,” Vice Admiral Sobti said.India and Africa give immense importance to maritime security and have reiterated their commitment to increase cooperation in tackling threats such as piracy, drugs smuggling, trafficking and other illegal activities through sharing of information and surveillance, he added.The IOS Sagar, in turn, will see 44 personnel -- already undergoing training at Kochi -- from Sri Lanka, Maldives, Mauritius, Comoros, Kenya, Madagascar, Mozambique, Seychelles and South Africa on board INS Sunayna, which will set sail from Karwar on April 5.The warship will undertake port calls at Dar-es-Salaam, Nacala, Port Louis, Port Victoria and Male as well as undertake joint surveillance of EEZs of Tanzania, Mozambique, Mauritius and Seychelles.",India will now for the first time conduct a major naval exercise with 10 African countries.

Moments later, he is seen attacking a woman who had come to his office with her child.As seen in the footage, he first threw a pile of papers at her before pushing her during an altercation. The incident quickly escalated into a heated argument, with others in the office intervening to separate them.The footage comes at a time when Bajinder Singh is already under investigation in a sexual harassment case.As per PTI, a 22-year-old woman accused the pastor of harassment, stating that he took her mobile number and began sending her messages.From 2022, Singh allegedly made her sit alone in a church cabin, where he hugged her and touched her inappropriately. She further claimed that he threatened to have her and her family eliminated if she reported him. The Punjab Police registered a case against Singh on February 28, booking him under Sections 354A (sexual harassment), 354D (stalking), and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC.Following the complaint, a three-member Special Investigation Team (SIT) was formed, led by Superintendent of Police Rupinder Kaur, to probe the allegations. The National Commission for Women (NCW) has also taken cognizance of the matter and demanded swift action against Singh.Singh, however, has dismissed the allegations, calling them ""baseless.""Speaking to the media earlier, he said, ""Fake chats can be easily created these days. They should provide proof against me. Everyone in the church knows that she [the complainant] suffered from fits and was troubled by evil spirits. People come here for prayers, and our job is to pray. She is like our daughter"".Singh has a history of controversy. In 2018, he was arrested at Delhi airport over a sexual harassment case filed by a woman from Zirakpur. More recently, a Mohali court issued warrants against him in that case. In 2022, he was accused of taking money from a Delhi-based family for treating their daughter, who later died.The preacher has also been on the radar of tax authorities, with income tax raids conducted at his premises in 2023.Despite these allegations, Singh remains a well-known figure with a massive social media following. His YouTube channel, ""Prophet Bajinder Singh,"" has over 3.74 million subscribers, and his sermons often attract large crowds, both in India and abroad.Celebrities such as actors Chunky Pandey and Aditya Pancholi have previously endorsed him.","CCTV video shows self-styled Christian prophet Bajinder Singh physically assaulting multiple individuals, including a woman with a child.

From 2020 to date, Centre has provided Rs 20,660 crore for road development of Ladakh,” Malhotra told journalists in Leh.The minister showcased progress on Bilaspur-Manali-Leh railway project with an Rs 1.31-lakh crore allocation. “At present, the journey from Delhi to Leh takes 40 hours (by road) but after the railway line is ready, it will reduce the distance to 20 hours,” Malhotra said. He added the Srinagar-Leh rail project had not been cancelled but put on hold.A major push for air connectivity is also on, with Rs 640 crore earmarked for a new terminal at Leh airport.With the chief executive of Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council (LAHDC) Tashi Gyalson by his side, Malhotra mentioned a flurry of projects. These included Shinku La Tunnel. PM Narendra Modi inaugurated the Rs 1,200-crore project on July 26 last year. It involves a 4.1-km twin-tube structure built at 15,800ft. The tunnel on Nimu-Padum-Darcha Road will be completed in two years and connect Himachal Pradesh and Ladakh. It will provide all-weather connectivity to Leh, vital for both civilian and military requirements.“Road infrastructure continues to be a priority, with Rs 2,405 crore earmarked for the Nimu-Padam-Darcha Road.

Centre redflags plan to remove 3 names from Haryana SC list,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/centre-redflags-plan-to-remove-3-names-from-haryana-sc-list/articleshow/119450146.cms,"NEW DELHI: Centre has waived a red flag at Haryana's decision to remove the names of three castes from the Scheduled Castes list and issue them caste certificates under other communities, telling the state that any inclusion to or exclusion from the SC list is the Parliament's prerogative. The state has also been told that a SC caste can only be given affirmative action benefits like reservation in its own name and not under any other group, even if it is part of the same sub-social bloc.The negative order is in response to Haryana's recent request to Centre that it should drop the names of 'Chura', 'Bhangi' and 'Mochi' from the list of SC communities for the state. As reported by TOI, the state has argued that the three names are ""objectionable and irrelevant"", in a move designed to end the usage of caste names that are widely deployed as pejoratives.To buttress its claim, Haryana had in its letter attached a 2013 state govt order in which it had announced that 'Chura, Bhangi' and 'Mochi' have been deleted from the local SC list, and the communities will be issued caste certificates in the name of 'Balmiki' and 'Chamar', respectively. The more than a decade old state govt order was addressed to all senior authorities of Haryana, especially the field administrators whose domain includes the process of issuing caste certificates.The proposal and the argument, however, have not found favour with Centre. Union social justice and empowerment ministry is learnt to have recently replied to Haryana that its 2013 order is ""impermissible"", and urged it to bring the circular in consonance with the Article 341 of the Constitution - which says that the power of inclusion in, and exclusion from, the SC list lies with the Parliament.","Haryana had asked Centre to drop the names of 'Chura', 'Bhangi' and 'Mochi' from the list of SC communities for the state.

SC asked police to lodge an FIR and investigate the allegations. It said police could not take a shortcut ""just because something happened in the hostel of an...institution like IIT Delhi"".Supreme Court on Monday agreed to examine the issue of mental health problems on campuses and set up a 10-member National Task Force under a former apex court judge.A bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan was hearing a petition by parents of two IIT-Delhi students who had taken the extreme step in 2023. Holding that lodging of FIRs was mandatory in cognisable offences, the court pulled up Delhi Police for not lodging a case despite the parents' complaint that the two students died by suicide after facing caste-based harassment from hostel inmates and faculty members.It directed Delhi Police to lodge an FIR and initiate a probe by an officer not below rank of assistant commissioner of police into allegations of caste discrimination in IIT-D.Noting that 98 students had died by suicide in top premier educational institutes since 2018 - 39 at IITs, 25 at NITs, 25 at central universities, four at IIMs, three at IISERs and two at IIITs - the bench expanded the litigation initiated by the aggrieved parents and set up a task force headed by retired SC Justice Ravindra Bhat to analyse and suggest measures to prevent such suicides. It will also comprise psychiatrist Alok Sarin, professors of clinical psychology Mary E John and Seema Mehrotra, and senior advocate Aparna Bhat.""Recurring instances of student suicides in higher educational institutions, including at private educational institutions, serve as a grim reminder of the inadequacy and ineffectiveness of the existing legal and institutional framework in addressing mental health concerns of students on campuses and to prevent students from taking the extreme step,"" it said.The court asked the panel to prepare a comprehensive report on predominant causes which led to such suicides, including but not limited to ragging, caste-based discrimination, gender-based discrimination, sexual harassment, academic pressure, financial burden, mental health-related stigma, discrimination based on ethnicity, tribal identity, disability, sexual orientation, political views, religious belief or any other ground.Pulling up Delhi Police for not lodging a case in the IIT-Delhi suicides, the bench said, ""Even if police were of the view that there was no element of truth in what had been alleged by the appellants (students' parents), it could have said so only after registering an FIR and conducting an investigation.

Cannot tolerate such a process of demolition: SC

Clip of girl fleeing bulldozer sparks outrage in UP

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Monday pulled up the Uttar Pradesh govt for demolishing houses in Prayagraj within 24 hours of serving notice, saying it had ""shocked the conscience of the court"" and hinted that it would allow the aggrieved owners to rebuild their houses subject to the outcome of the case challenging the demolition. The case pertains to razing of the houses of a lawyer, a professor, and others in 2021.A bench of Justices Abhay Oka and N Kotishwar Singh, based on the claim by the aggrieved, took exception to the manner in which demolition was carried out and termed it the state's high-handedness. ""It shocks the conscience of the court the manner in which within 24 hours of the notice it was done,"" it said.The UP govt, however, disputed the version of the petitioners that the demolition squad had moved in a day after notices were served on them.Attorney general R Venkataramani, appearing for the state, argued that reasonable time was given to the petitioners to respond to the notice. He said on Dec 8, 2020, they were given the first notice, followed by notices in Jan 2021 and March 2021. The petitioners said the demolition notice was issued March 1, 2021, served on March 6, 2021, and demolition carried out on March 7.The petitioners said they were not given a reasonable opportunity to challenge the demolition notice before the appellate authority under Section 27(2) of the UP Urban Planning and Development Act.""State must act very fairly and state must give reasonable time to enable them to file an appeal before the structures are demolished. Notice served on March 6 and demolition carried out on March 7. Now, we will allow them to reconstruct,"" the bench said.The bench pointed out that the notices were served by affixture, which is not the method approved by the law and only the last notice was served through the legally recognised method.""Therefore, we are going to pass order only in the light of these facts. The manner in which the whole process has been conducted... the court cannot tolerate such a process. If we tolerate in one case, it will continue. We will pass an order that they can reconstruct at their own cost and if the appeal fails, then they will have to demolish at their own cost,"" it said.The court asked the petitioners to file an undertaking and adjourned the case. The petitioners in the case are advocate Zulfiqar Haider, Prof Ali Ahmed and three other individuals. They moved the apex court after Allahabad high court dismissed their plea against the demolition.The video of an eight-year-old girl clutching her books and running away from her shanty during an anti-encroachment drive in Ambedkar Nagar’s Jalalpur area in UP has sparked widespread outrage.The footage, which surfaced on social media, showed an earthmover revving nearby, drawing sharp criticism from opposition parties. Former UP CM and SP president Akhilesh Yadav condemned the demolition, calling it an example of the state’s deteriorating condition.On Monday, he posted on X, “Eight years, UP ruined, and only questions remain.” He also shared an AI-generated image of a girl holding books while a bulldozer loomed in the background.

Kashmiri Pandits who stayed in Valley after 1990 demand same facilities as migrants,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kashmiri-pandits-who-stayed-in-valley-after-1990-demand-same-facilities-as-migrants/articleshow/119439063.cms,"SRINAGAR: Kashmiri Pandits based in Kashmir Valley are facing a “demographic erosion”, the community leadership on Monday said, and urged central and J&K govts to make efforts to check it by ending their “systemic exclusion”.“In 2008 there were 808 non-migrant Kashmiri Pandit families in the Valley. Today the number has dropped below 650. This demographic erosion is not accidental. It is a direct result of systemic exclusion and psychological warfare against our community, even as the central govt claims to support us,” said Sanjay Tickoo, president of Kashmiri Pandit Sangharsh Samiti, an organisation which works for Valley-based Kashmiri Pandits.Tickoo blamed the leadership of migrant Kashmiri Pandits for the plight of community members who stayed on in the Valley even after the 1990 insurgency.He said the Pandits who refused to leave the land of their ancestors are facing sustained bureaucratic apathy and political marginalisation. After a long struggle, the central govt in Dec 2014 extended partial relief by introducing a rehabilitation programme for Kashmiri Pandits, under which it devised two prime minister’s packages in 2008 and 2015. The packages included housing for the migrants to encourage their return to the valley, employment, and increase in monthly cash assistance from Rs 500 per family in 1990 to Rs 13,000 per family. According to govt figures, out of 6,000 posts announced under PM packages, about 3,800 migrants have been provided govt employment.However, Tickoo alleged that non-migrant Kashmiri Pandits were denied any assistance. “The most distressing aspect of this prolonged injustice is the betrayal by sections of the migrant Kashmiri Pandit leadership, who instead of supporting their brethren, colluded with the administration to ensure that the benefits meant for the non-migrant community were never truly implemented,” he said.Tickoo appealed to the Omar Abdullah govt to help the Valley-based Kashmiri Pandits get the benefits meant for the community. “The continued neglect of our issues has caused immense distress, and we believe the time has come for these concerns to be acknowledged and addressed in earnest. If this indifference continues, we may be compelled to launch campaigns in various forms and bring these long standing grievances to the attention of international forums,” he said.","In 2008 there were 808 non-migrant Kashmiri Pandit families in the Valley.

Elon Musk Tesla Latest News: Tesla investor who called for Elon Musk's exit says Board should not have allowed him to purchase Twitter,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/tesla-investor-who-called-for-elon-musks-exit-says-board-should-not-have-allowed-him-to-purchase-twitter/articleshow/119351660.cms,"Some Tesla investors want Elon Musk to step down from the CEO post.

Can Elon Musk be removed as CEO?



Long-time Tesla investor Ross Gerber, the CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management, who called for Elon Musk 's exit from the company has now said that the Tesla Board should have never let him purchase Twitter as that started Elon Musk's distraction from Tesla. ""Why has the board of directors sat quietly while so much brand value has been eroded to the point that cars are being set on fire?"" he said. ""It's been wildly negligent that the board has done nothing to curb Elon's behavior, especially around extremist statements.""Gerber's statement came as shares of Tesla dropped in the wake of massive protests against Elon Musk inside the country and also outside. Hundreds of Tesla vehicles have been set on fire showing anger against Elon's interference in the government decisions. The arson incidents are being treated as 'domestic terrorism' by the Donald Trump administration who sympathized with Elon at this time of crisis.Elon, however, brushed aside the emergency and adviced shareholders to hold on to their shares -- in a surprised all-hands meeting of Tesla.Gerber said the Tesla Board can't do anything against Musk as it solely functions for the benefit of Elon and is highly compensated by him. ""They're not going to do anything he doesn't say,"" Gerber said.Newsweek reported that Tesla shareholders don't have the power to directly vote to remove the CEO. But they could influence the Board if they believe Musk's leadership endangers their investment. ""An ouster would likely occur if enough board members—facing pressure from large investors—determined that Musk's actions or controversies significantly harmed Tesla's performance or reputation,"" David Park, professor of entrepreneurship at Syracuse University, told Newsweek.Gerber believes Tesla is suffering because of Elon Musk's involvement with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) -- the department that he has been leading solely after Vivek Ramaswamy's exit. DOGE has a mandate to cut the government spending within a year and after that DOGE is supposed to stop functioning.As the world's wealthiest individual, Musk has assumed a prominent position in President Donald Trump's second term, heading DOGE. However, his engagement in politics has sparked investor unease, leading to Tesla's poor market performance throughout 2025.In 2025, Tesla's share value has declined by 37 per cent, following Musk's controversial political statements and decisions. Recent weeks have also witnessed increasing incidents of Tesla vehicles being targeted for vandalism including gunshots fired at Tesla dealerships, or targeted in arson attacks.Read more: Tesla arson attacks investigated as 'domestic terrorism,' backed by radical group tied to 2020 riots","Long-time Tesla investor Ross Gerber, the CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management, called for Elon Musk's exit from the company.

Indians on green cards are advised not to panic but to carry relevant documents when returning to the US from abroad,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/indians-on-green-cards-are-advised-not-to-panic-but-to-carry-relevant-documents-when-returning-to-the-us-from-abroad/articleshow/119419156.cms,"Checklist of documents that green card holders should carry with them for re-entry into the US



Valid and unexpired green card (Form I-551) – Ensure it is unexpired.

Passport from home country

Re-entry permit (if applicable) – Needed for those staying abroad for over one year but less than two years

Pay stubs from current employment (last 3 months)

Employment verification letter

Previous year’s W-2 form and federal income tax return copy

US bank account details

US driver’s licence

With a tough immigration policy being followed by the US government and key agencies including the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection ( CBP ), putting green card holders under heightened scrutiny; many Indians who are living and working in the US with legal permanent resident status (green cards) are worried.A recent statement by US Vice-President, JD Vance , that a green card “doesn’t give you an indefinite right to stay in the US”, has sparked concerns among thousands of Indians who are in the US on green cards. However, many experts and immigration attorneys feel that there’s no need to panic for most Indians who are on green cards and may need to travel outside the US, including on visits to India.“Though green cards can be revoked for certain reasons, including national security risks or criminal activity, most Indian professionals are law-abiding and tax-paying individuals. They don’t need to panic. As long as they follow US laws, avoid criminal activities, maintain strong ties to the US, and avoid extended stays abroad, they have little to worry about,” feels Neha Mahajan , co-founder of Skilled Immigrants in America (SIIA), an organisation supporting Indians stuck in long green card queues. She adds that green cards aren’t automatically at risk unless someone engages in actions that violate immigration rules or national security policies.The green card is a status of permanent resident in the US; hence strong ties to the US are important. “One can have multiple residences but the US government wants America to be the permanent residence of green card holders,” says Manjunath Gokare , an attorney based in Atlanta, Georgia, who specialises in immigration. Law requires that the green card holder must live in the US (maintain a home or apartment); maintain employment in the US; file income taxes in the US on all income earned globally; and maintain US bank accounts and driver’s licence.An important factor for green card status is the duration of travel outside the US and long absences are not recommended. “A stay of less than six months outside the US typically does not raise questions. A stay of more than six months but less than one year could result in additional scrutiny upon arrival in the US. A stay beyond one year without a valid re-entry permit (Form I-131) may lead to the presumption that you have abandoned your green card,” says Mumbai-based immigration lawyer, Poorvi Chothani.For green card holders, it is important to keep certain documents with them and to make sure that they are valid and updated. “Keep your green card valid and on you and renew it on time and always carry the original when you are travelling. Keep your US bank account, active health insurance, driver’s licence, and tax records up to date,” says Mahajan. She adds that green card holders should file taxes as resident (1040) and not as non-resident.Given the increased scrutiny at ports of entry, it is wise to carry certain documents for green card holders returning from overseas. “These include pay stubs from your current employment (last 3 months); employment verification letter and last year’s W-2 form and federal income tax return copy,” says Gokare.It is very important for green card holders not to have been convicted of any criminal offences (classified under US immigration laws as aggravated felonies) that render them deportable or removable, under US immigration laws.“If one is maintaining their permanent residence in the US and does not have any criminal convictions, then there is nothing to worry about. Green card holders that are targeted by CBP, typically have either residency issues or removable criminal convictions,” says Gokare. He adds that green card holders who believe that they have always complied with the law, but are yet facing issues at the port of entry, should ask the CBP officers to set up a ‘deferred inspection’.“With an appointment for deferred inspection, a green card holder is allowed to provide evidence and can be accompanied by a lawyer when they meet with CBP officers to present their case as to how they are maintaining permanent residence in the US,” he says.If faced with tough questions at a US border, green card holders are advised not to sign any forms; including Form I-407; which is the record of abandonment of legal permanent residence status; without consulting their lawyers, even if there is pressure from CBP. “No one is legally required to sign it. If they refuse, CBP cannot unilaterally strip them of their green card without due process,” says Chothani.Despite providing evidence of resident status and ties to the US, if CBP officials ask green card holders to renounce their green cards on arrival, there are still certain potential recourse measures that can be taken up.“Those who have been outside the US for an extended period should be prepared for questioning by CBP officers. If placed in secondary inspection, it is best to remain calm and provide clear responses regarding ties to the US,” says Chothani.Secondary inspections can take up to two hours to clear and Gokare advises anyone facing such inspections to co-operate with the officers and not get alarmed. Even if CBP insists that a green card holder is inadmissible or has abandoned their green card, they can still request a notice to appear before an immigration judge. This allows them to fight the case in immigration court rather than surrendering the green card at the airport.“If an individual’s green card is revoked, they may still have a few options including filing for a motion with the USCIS or immigration court to reopen or reconsider and applying for a returning resident visa to regain LPR status,” Chothani says.Finally, five years after getting their green cards, those who are eligible can consider US citizenship. “It’s the best way to make sure you don’t have to worry about losing your status,” says Mahajan. She adds that green card holders should stay engaged; follow rules and not let small mistakes put their status at risk.","A recent statement by US Vice-President, JD Vance, has sparked concerns among thousands of Indians who are in the US on green cards.

8 years of Yogi govt: A flag-bearer of Sanatan who made development his 'dharma',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/8-years-of-yogi-govt-a-flag-bearer-of-sanatan-who-made-development-his-dharma/articleshow/119453779.cms,"LUCKNOW: From a surprise appointment as Uttar Pradesh chief minister in 2017 to a popular choice as the CM in BJP Govt 2.0 in 2022, Yogi Adityanath has grown immensely in stature within the BJP and has emerged as the most prominent face of the party, at least in UP, in the past eight years of his two consecutive terms.Yogi also holds the record of longest serving chief minister of Uttar Pradesh.Though the number of seats that the BJP secured in 2017 gave Yogi a chance to establish himself, as stability was no concern at that time, the onus of performance in 2022 assembly polls wrested surely and solely on him and the credibility that he had earned in the first five years of governance. Yogi’s model of governance and popularity fetched 255 seats to the BJP in the 2022 assembly elections.The catalyst for the party’s resounding success in UP elections was mainly the maintenance of law and order with an iron hand.Security and law and order have always been a major concern for successive govts and it was one of the major reasons which led to the loss of the Samajwadi Party in 2017.After taking over the reins of the govt, Yogi immediately started working on the law-and-order front which led to encounters of dreaded criminals and active focus on quick prosecution of those who were behind bars.Stability in posting of officers also gave ample opportunities to bureaucrats to perform at the ground level. All this created an atmosphere where Uttar Pradesh could write its growth story.A conducive atmosphere was created which instilled confidence among business leaders in the new dispensation under Yogi Adityanath which resulted in the first investors’ summit in Feb 2018 with agreement on intent of over Rs 4.28 lakh crore investments within one year of the formation of the govt.The CM made it a point to ensure that intents received during the summit were materialised on the ground. The next few years saw ground-breaking ceremonies which showcased the Yogi govt’s intent to not only sign MoUs but also to bring most of the projects on the ground.While industrialisation and providing conducive environments to investors remained on top of the agenda, the CM did not shift his focus from UP’s core economic activity, the agriculture sector. He ensured that central govt schemes in the sector were implemented in letter and spirit and provided relief to farmers in his first cabinet meeting by waiving debt of over 83 lakh farmers.However, what made Yogi seen as a tough administrator was his stringent action against criminals and mafia irrespective of how influential ther were. He also kept his focus on women safety leading to drastic reduction in cases of eve-teasing and harassment after he set up anti-Romeo squads which kept vigil outside schools and colleges.He ensured that the Centre’s free ration scheme reached every household in the below poverty line (BPL) category. Yogi showed clarity and conviction while moving forward with anti-appeasement policy and adopting tough measures to ward off any hooliganism by members of any community to disturb communal harmony.Yogi repeatedly proved that though he looked after 26 crore people of the state, he would be remembered as one of the torchbearers of Sanatan and Hindutva. Be it the survey of a mosque in Sambhal, or adjusting with Friday prayers during Ramzan when it coincided with Holi, the CM was clear that festivities were held peacefully.His focus on law and order, coupled with pro-poor welfare schemes, proved a gamechanger in 2022 assembly elections. The election result came as a stamp of approval on Yogi’s authority as political experts credited the success to Yogi’s style of governance and his tough measures to bring UP on a path of progress and make it a trillion-dollar economy by 2028.Besides providing an unbiased governance ensuring that the benefits of welfare schemes reach everyone irrespective of caste, creed, and religious faith, Yogi’s style of governance remained clear on issues related to Hindutva as he kept on raking up issues related to threat to Sanatan with slogans like ‘Batenge to katenge’, that ultimately became a war cry in the 2024 UP byelections and also echoed in assembly polls in Haryana. Deft management of Maha Kumbh at the 45-day mela at Prayagraj further cemented his position as the flag-bearer of Sanatan.His focus on promoting religious tourism also bore positive results with record footfall at places like Ayodhya, Kashi, Mathura, and Prayagraj.What further strengthened Yogi’s credibility was his perseverance in carrying forward with whatever he initiated, be it the ‘One district, one product’ scheme, inviting investors and continuous hammering on the law-and-order front to keep the police on their toes.A year after the BJP govt 2.0 took over, Yogi decided to hold Global Investors Summit-2023. The improved credibility of Yogi and his reformist policies led to signing of MoUs worth over Rs 40 lakh crore. The govt also ensured that most of the projects for which MoUs were signed see the light of the day. A total of four ground-breaking ceremonies have led to around 14,000 projects worth over Rs 10 lakh crore becoming a reality, according to Invest UP website.However, despite smooth sailing, the BJP failed to perform in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections mainly due to its failure to assess caste equation and overconfidence in getting votes in the name of Prime Minister Narendra Modi while ignoring grassroots workers.Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath continued to toil hard and took it on his own to ensure that the BJP, despite suffering huge losses in Lok Sabha polls, comes out with flying colours during bypolls on 10 assembly seats. The party won eight out of 10 seats, including Muslim-dominated Kundarki, complex-caste ridden Katehri, and Milkipur in Ayodhya.His focus on zero tolerance on corruption was not mere lip service as it was proved by action against officials found guilty of corrupt practices, the latest example being the suspension of Invest UP CEO Abhishek Prakash following complaints of demand for bribery through a middleman.His flip side, however, continues to be his over-dependence on the official machinery and lesser trust on his legislative assembly colleagues. Nonetheless, after the 2022 Assembly elections, he made concerted efforts to regularly meet the MLAs and BJP workers and give them a patient hearing.","Yogi Adityanath has emerged as the most prominent face of the party, at least in UP, in the past eight years of his two consecutive terms.

Trump to impose high tariffs on countries buying Venezuelan oil. Will it impact India?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-to-impose-high-tariffs-on-countries-buying-venezuelan-oil-will-it-impact-india/articleshow/119450907.cms,"25% tariffs on Venezuelan oil



Will it impact India?



Failure to uphold agreement



The 'dirty 15' countries



US President Donald Trump on Monday announced high tariffs on imports from countries buying Venezuelan oil and gas—a move that could impact India, China, and others while fueling global trade tensions.""Venezuela has been very hostile to the United States and the Freedoms which we espouse. Therefore, any Country that purchases Oil and/or Gas from Venezuela will be forced to pay a Tariff of 25% to the United States on any Trade they do with our Country,"" Trump posted on Truth Social.Trump further accused Venezuela of ""purposefully and deceitfully"" sending criminals to the United States, including violent offenders and members of organisations such as Tren de Aragua.Trump has aggressively imposed tariffs on both allies and rivals, using them as a tool to exert economic and diplomatic pressure, since his return to the White House in January.The newly proposed 25% tariffs on Venezuelan oil, affecting both direct and indirect purchasers, could be implemented from April 2, as per Trump's signed directive.The implementation decision rests with the secretary of state, who will consult with other US agencies before determining whether to enforce these levies.These tariffs scheduled for April 2, coincides with Trump's planned announcement of reciprocal tariffs on other nations—a day he calls ""liberation day.""In addition to reciprocal tariffs, he has vowed to impose broad sector-specific duties on imported automobiles, pharmaceuticals, and semiconductors.The tariffs could impact India and China, as both nations import Venezuelan oil, along with the United States and Spain. Trump confirmed the 25% tariff would be additional to existing rates.The order stipulates that the 25% tariff will cease one year after a country's last Venezuelan oil import, or earlier at Washington's discretion.In 2024, India imported 22 million barrels of oil from Venezuela, which made up 1.5% of India's total crude oil purchases.In January 2024: The nation's imports increased to above 254,000 barrels per day, representing approximately half of Venezuela's aggregate oil exports, which totalled nearly 557,000 barrels per day during this period.In December 2023: India's crude oil imports stood at roughly 191,600 barrels per day. The distribution amongst companies showed Reliance Industries securing 127,000 barrels per day.Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) obtained 37,000 barrels per day, and the HPCL-Mittal Energy received 28,000 barrels per day.Last year in February, Venezuela exported approximately 500,000 barrels of oil daily to China and 240,000 barrels to the United States, according to AFP.Trump's announcement follows last month's suspension of the deportation pipeline between the US and Venezuela, citing Caracas' failure to uphold an agreement to take back migrants quickly. Following this, Venezuela withdrew from accepting these flights.Earlier on Saturday, Caracas announced reaching a new agreement with Washington to resume deportations, resulting in nearly 200 Venezuelan nationals being deported from the US through Honduras.Separately, the Trump administration extended the operational deadline for US petroleum corporation Chevron in Venezuela until May 27. The firm had been functioning under a sanctions exemption.Earlier, during an interview with Maria Bartiromo on Fox Business, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that Washington would approach trading partners to discuss tariff levels and non-tariff barriers.Bessent explained that countries could potentially avoid these levies by discontinuing their current practices.During the same discussion, Bessent mentioned that the tariffs would target approximately 15 percent of nations having trade imbalances with the US, referring to them as a ""dirty 15.""","US President Donald Trump on Monday announced high tariffs on imports from countries buying Venezuelan oil and gas.

(Writer is a senior journalist & political commentator)

LUCKNOW: In 2017, when Yogi Adityanath ’s government was formed in Uttar Pradesh , everyone was surprised, wondering how a monk from a monastery could manage a vast state like Uttar Pradesh, especially since Yogi Ji had no prior experience in governance or administration. Even after he became the Chief Minister, speculation continued for a long time, questioning how long he would be able to handle power. But today, as the BJP government has successfully completed 8 years under his leadership, looking back reveals that under Yogi Ji’s leadership, the government has written a new story of progress in the state.Before 2017, Uttar Pradesh was known as a backward state where each district was ruled by mafia gangs. Law and order were in a poor state, and no major corporate group or businessman was willing to invest capital in the state. However, from 2017 to March 2025, a lot has changed in the state. Today, under Yogi Adityanath’s leadership, Uttar Pradesh has become the growth engine of the country’s economy. This transformation is not just about policies; it is the result of strong willpower, transparent policies, and solid implementation.Talking about law and order, until 2017, the state was struggling with issues of poor law and order, inadequate infrastructure, and lack of investment. But now, under the double-engine government, Uttar Pradesh has emerged as the fastest-growing economy in the country.Today, UP is setting new records in various important areas like electricity, roads, health, infrastructure, investment, and security. The state has now become a major hub for investment and logistics.Since Yogi Adityanath took charge of the state, he has made his mark on every front. He is a hardworking and visionary leader, and the most significant thing is that he accomplishes whatever he sets his mind to. Under his leadership, Uttar Pradesh has become not just a land of possibilities but a land of opportunities.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said about Yogi Adityanath and the state: “Today, the people of Uttar Pradesh, under the leadership of Yogi Adityanath Ji , have completely transformed the picture of the state. Under Yogi Ji’s leadership, law and order have improved, and connectivity is rapidly advancing. More work is happening today for modern transportation in UP than in the seven decades after independence. The way UP is modernizing under the double-engine government is truly unprecedented.”To enforce strong law and order, a zero-tolerance policy has been adopted against crime and criminals. The Police Commissionerate system has been implemented in Lucknow, Gautam Buddha Nagar, Kanpur Nagar, Varanasi, Agra, Ghaziabad, and Prayagraj. A Special Security Force has been established in UP. In action against notorious criminals, 222 criminals have been killed in encounters so far, and 8,118 have been injured. Police have arrested and imprisoned 28,085 criminals with bounties on their heads.Compared to 2017, UP-112’s response time has improved remarkably, dropping from 25 minutes to just 7 minutes and 24 seconds by 2024. Most importantly, the Yogi Adityanath government passed the Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Religious Conversion Bill. It has provisions for life imprisonment as the maximum punishment for those found guilty of deceiving someone into marriage and illegally converting their religion.Special attention has been given to women’s safety, and Anti-Romeo Squads have been established in every district. In crimes against women and minors, 27,425 cases have been prosecuted, including 11,254 cases under the POCSO Act and 3,775 cases of dowry-related deaths. The Uttar Pradesh State Forensic Science Institute has been established. Various steps have been taken to improve law and order, which has built people’s trust in the legal system.Apart from improving law and order, the Yogi government has done excellent work in connectivity. With the Purvanchal Expressway and Bundelkhand Expressway operational and the Ganga Expressway nearing completion, the Gorakhpur Link Expressway will soon be opened to the public. After the completion of the Ganga Expressway, Uttar Pradesh will have 55% of the expressways in the country.Additionally, work is about to begin on new expressways, including the Vindhya Expressway, Purvanchal Link Expressway , and an expressway connecting Bundelkhand Expressway from Chitrakoot to Prayagraj via Rewa. Another expressway will connect the Ganga Expressway from Meerut to Haridwar.Over the past 8 years, the expansion of infrastructure has ensured seamless connectivity through air, water, road, and rail networks, promoting easy logistics for industries to reach domestic and international markets.When law and order improved, investments started pouring in on a large scale. Uttar Pradesh has now become a dream destination for business and investment. Over the past 8 years, investment proposals worth approximately ₹45 lakh crores have been received, of which proposals worth ₹15 lakh crores have been implemented on the ground. This has been made possible by a robust law and order system, ease of doing business, investment-friendly policies, a single-window system, and an accountable and transparent framework.We can see that Yogi Adityanath has set a remarkable example of visionary leadership that will serve as an inspiration for any future leader. Yogi has been completely successful in implementing Prime Minister Modi’s vision on the ground.This does not mean that he hasn’t faced challenges over the past 8 years. Apart from the opposition, he has faced tough challenges from within his own party and organization. Speculation about him has continued constantly from his adversaries, and there have been repeated attempts to break his morale. But, like a seasoned warrior, he has faced every difficulty with determination.Today, Yogi Adityanath is counted among the top leaders in the country. The “Brand Yogi” has consistently grown stronger, which is a testament to his hard work and dedication. Over the past 8 years, he has proven himself capable of tackling and resolving the most difficult challenges.However, it is essential to note that he still has a long way to go in politics, and for that, he needs a strong and trustworthy team. His information system should be robust, and he should surround himself with trustworthy individuals and high-level professionals so that he can face any future challenge and carve a new path in Indian politics.","In 2017, Yogi Adityanath ’s government was formed in Uttar Pradesh.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Delhi Results 2025: 'LinkedIn Lessons' from Brand BJP's win and Brand AAP's loss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-results-2025-linkedin-lessons-from-brand-bjps-win-and-brand-aaps-loss/articleshow/118066797.cms,"AAP: From Disruptor to Establishment to Decline



AAP was the ultimate political startup—the kind that raises Series A, B, and C funding at record speed, becomes a unicorn, and then implodes under its own weight. It was supposed to be the alternative to traditional politics, the fresh face in a crowded market, a party that rejected caste, religion, and dynasty-driven politics.

But somewhere along the way, it stopped being a startup and started behaving like an old-school corporate giant—bloated, bureaucratic, and overconfident.

1) From Lean & Agile to Bureaucratic & Slow

AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach—the political equivalent of a D2C brand shaking up a legacy market.

Over time, it became centralized and top-heavy, with decision-making confined to a handful of leaders. MLAs became inaccessible, the leadership became distant, and ground-level mobilization weakened. No succession planning. Kejriwal remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force.

remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force. The result? Voters saw it as just another party, not the disruptor it once was.

2) A Reputation Built on Ethics, Lost to Scandals

AAP built its brand on fighting corruption—but its own leadership got embroiled in one of the biggest scandals of its time, the liquor policy scam.

Manish Sisodia, Sanjay Singh, and even Kejriwal himself faced corruption allegations, undoing years of anti-corruption positioning.

The Sheesh Mahal controversy—where Kejriwal’s residence was allegedly renovated with ₹45 crore of taxpayer money—completely shattered the “humble leader” narrative.

AAP’s response? Defensive, aggressive, and dismissive. Instead of damage control, it doubled down on denial—a classic PR blunder.

The perception shift was swift and brutal—from “anti-corruption warriors” to just another power-hungry political entity.

3) Ignoring the Middle-Class Voter That Built Its Base

AAP was originally the party of the middle class—frustrated taxpayers who wanted clean governance and economic relief.

Over time, its focus shifted to freebies and populist policies, leaving the middle class feeling ignored.

BJP stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters.

stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters. Kejriwal’s pre-election outreach to the middle class felt forced and last-minute—while BJP had already solidified its positioning.

Takeaway ? A business (or party) that forgets its core customer will eventually lose them.

4) Blaming External Factors Instead of Owning Failures

For 10 years, AAP blamed the Centre, the LG, and opposition parties for everything.

The “victim card” was effective in the early years but wore thin by 2025—voters expected governance, not excuses.

BJP flipped this weakness into an advantage, promising that with a BJP-led government, there would be no Centre-state conflicts, leading to “seamless governance.”

The narrative changed from “AAP vs. BJP” to “AAP vs. Results.” Lesson? Leaders who constantly shift blame instead of delivering solutions lose credibility.

5) Strategic Missteps and Lack of Political Alliances

AAP contested separately from Congress, which led to a split in the anti-BJP vote.

Rahul Gandhi’s direct attacks on Kejriwal made matters worse—AAP was getting hit from both sides.

Internal conflicts weakened the party further. Atishi and Saurabh Bharadwaj were seen as Kejriwal’s successors, but there was no clear transition strategy.

BJP: A Masterclass in Strategic Adaptation

BJP’s 2025 win in Delhi was not a Modi-centric sweep but a well-calibrated organizational comeback. After a lackluster 2024 Lok Sabha performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader.

performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader. Unlike AAP, BJP adapted, restructured, and executed flawlessly.

1) Moving Beyond Modi Dependency

BJP understood that Delhi’s electorate needed a more localized approach.

Instead of making the election about Modi, it focused on governance, urban issues, and direct voter engagement.

No CM face? It didn’t matter. The party projected collective leadership instead of relying on one individual.

By decentralizing its campaign, BJP looked more stable and future-ready.

2) Adopting AAP’s Own Strategies Against It

BJP neutralized AAP’s welfare advantage—promising free electricity, continued subsidies, and additional financial support for women.

Middle-class tax reliefs were announced just before the elections, ensuring they won over voters that AAP had neglected.

The manifesto focused on real urban issues—pollution control, traffic congestion, and infrastructure—exactly what AAP had failed to address convincingly.

Lesson? The best way to beat a competitor is to adopt their strengths while exposing their weaknesses.

3) Letting Congress Do The Attacking



BJP didn’t need to attack AAP aggressively—Rahul Gandhi and Congress did that for them.

By letting AAP and Congress fight it out, BJP consolidated its voter base while the opposition split.

AAP’s credibility suffered more because the attacks came from within the anti-BJP camp.

A strategic win, without unnecessary effort.

4) A Disciplined, Focused, and Well-Executed Campaign

BJP stayed on message, focusing on corruption, governance, and economic stability.

The campaign was structured and well-planned, unlike AAP’s which seemed reactive and disorganized.

The promise to investigate AAP’s corruption cases resonated with voters, reinforcing BJP’s stance on accountability.

In business terms? BJP had a clear marketing strategy, strong brand positioning, and flawless execution.

5) Final Takeaways

Adaptability is key. BJP recalibrated after its 2024 Lok Sabha setbacks, while AAP remained stagnant.

Brand trust is fragile. AAP built its image on honesty but lost credibility due to scandals and mismanagement.

Execution matters more than rhetoric. BJP delivered a disciplined, well-structured campaign.

Leadership succession planning is critical. AAP failed to build second-line leadership, while BJP showcased organizational depth.

Voters reward governance, not excuses. After a decade in power, AAP’s blame game no longer worked.

Politics, like business, rewards those who adapt, execute, and deliver.

Ah, another election, another flood of LinkedIn wisdom posts—where every poll result is a ""case study,"" every political leader is a ""CEO,"" and every campaign is an ""MBA-level lesson in leadership."" Some call it democracy, but on LinkedIn, it’s all about business jargon and corporate analogies.So, let’s break this down the LinkedIn way.BJP, on the other hand, had a structured, disciplined campaign with clear messaging and no internal rifts. In politics and business, a divided team rarely wins.","AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach.

Ten years of incumbency

Liquor scam, Sheesh Mahal dent Kejriwal's 'imandaar' image

No tie-up, Congress did strategic campaigning

Flood of freebies but no next-level of development

BJP focuses on Kejriwal, Hindutva takes back seat

BJP's latent vote

Rahul roasted Kejriwal as payback for Haryana

MCD with AAP: No excuses

Steady exodus of AAP leaders

AAP goes negative

The BJP on Saturday pulled off a major political upset by unseating the Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ) from Delhi after over 10 years. As per the latest Election Commission data, the BJP may win around 48 seats and the Kejriwal-led party may secure around 22 seats in the 70-seat Assembly.BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in a fierce contest from the New Delhi seat by a margin of 4,089 votes. Verma, 47, bagged 30,088 votes, while Kejriwal and Congress' Sandeep Dikshit got 25,999 votes and 4,568 votes.Kejriwal conceded his defeat and hoped that the BJP will fulfill all its promises.""We accept the mandate of the people with great humility. I congratulate the BJP for this victory and I hope they will fulfil all the promises for which people have voted for them,"" Kejriwal said in a video address posted on X.In the evening as the results were decalred, PM Modi kicked off his victory speech with a powerful chant of ""Yamuna Maiya ki Jai"". PM Modi declared that the people of Delhi were experiencing both relief and joy -- relief from the ""disaster"" (AAP-da governance) and joy in embracing a new era under BJP rule. ""I had written a letter to every Delhi resident, urging them to give the BJP a chance to serve in the 21st century...Today, I bow my head in gratitude to every family in Delhi for trusting us. You have given us love with an open heart, and I assure you that we will return it manifold through rapid development,"" PM Modi said.The Prime Minister also attacked the AAP over allegations of corruption against its leaders, saying that all links of such charges will be probed and those who ""looted"" money will have to return it.With the BJP set to regain control of Delhi after 27 years, what went wrong for the Aam Aadmi Party?After governing Delhi for a decade, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) faced significant anti-incumbency.While AAP achieved impressive results in health and education during its first two terms, and kept voters happy with power and water subsidies, unfulfilled promises, such as improved air quality, became major poll issues.The AAP's assertion that the BJP government at the Centre was creating roadblocks in its functioning began to be increasingly seen by voters as excuses, especially after ten years in power.The BJP's ""double engine"" promise, suggesting seamless governance between the central and state levels, appealed to voters against the backdrop of AAP's constant conflicts with the Centre. Furthermore, internal disarray within the AAP, with senior leaders facing jail time, added to the challenges of incumbency .The image of Arvind Kejriwal as an anti-corruption crusader suffered a setback due to several factors, most notably the controversy surrounding the now-scrapped liquor policy.The BJP accused the AAP government of turning Delhi into a ""city of drunkards"" with the new policy, and receiving crores in kickbacks from those who opened the vends.Probes by central agencies led to the arrest of top AAP leaders, including Arvind Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia, and Sanjay Singh. These arrests forced Sisodia to step down as deputy chief minister and kept the AAP in ""firefighting mode"", distracting from fulfilling its 2020 poll promises.Additionally, the ""Sheesh Mahal"" controversy, referring to the renovated residence of the chief minister, further dented Kejriwal's image. The BJP further highlighted a Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) report that indicated the renovation cost had increased from an initial estimate of Rs 7.91 crore to Rs 33.66 crore by completion.AAP has been synonymous with Arvind Kejriwal since its inception. Kejriwal, initially seen as an agent of change with his untucked shirt and no-nonsense demeanor, resonated with the common person.However, the anti-corruption image of Kejriwal and his party suffered irreparable damage, specially after the AAP leader's arrest in March 2024 on corruption allegations and his subsequent resignation as CM.While he was later granted bail, the leadership transition to Atishi and the circumstances surrounding Kejriwal's arrest damaged the party's image and cohesion.The absence of an alliance with the Congress party and the Congress's strategic campaigning likely contributed to the AAP's loss.In previous elections, the AAP had significantly reduced the Congress's presence in the Delhi assembly.Attempts to convince Congress workers to collaborate with AAP volunteers reportedly led to an ""existential crisis"" among them.The Congress decided to campaign aggressively against the AAP, sensing ""anger building up against the AAP"". Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra attacked the AAP in the final days of the Delhi campaign.The Congress further claimed the AAP did not want an alliance, with Kejriwal announcing all 70 candidates early on.The rise of AAP in Delhi has been congruous with the decline of the Congress. In 2013, AAP won 28 seats with a 29.49% vote share, while the Congress tally decreased to 8 seats from 43 in 2008. In 2015, Congress suffered a 15% decline in its vote share, while the AAP saw its support base rise by around 15%.While AAP's welfare schemes, such as free electricity and bus travel for women, initially garnered support, a lack of focus on infrastructure development and maintenance became a significant issue.The poor condition of roads and sewers across Delhi angered voters.Overflowing drains, potholed roads, and irregular garbage collection contributed to the party's unpopularity.The AAP's control over the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) meant it could not deflect blame for these issues onto the BJP. Voters in middle- and upper-middle-class areas were particularly affected by the deteriorating infrastructure.AAP's origins trace back to Anna Hazare’s anti-corruption movement, positioning the party as an alternative to the Congress in 2013.While AAP secured mandates in 2015 and 2020, their repeated promises and ""freebies"" seem to have lost their appeal.The promise of piped water connections for all in 2015 remains unfulfilled, as does the promise of full statehood for Delhi and the ""Rozgar Budget"" aimed at creating 20 lakh jobs.Kejriwal himself admitted that he had failed to fulfill three promises: cleaning the Yamuna, providing clean drinking water, and upgrading Delhi's roads. This acknowledgment gave the BJP an opportunity to attack the AAP, with Amit Shah mocking Kejriwal's promise to purify the Yamuna.The BJP's campaign strategy focused primarily on targeting Arvind Kejriwal and his government, rather than emphasising Hindutva, as it has often done during campainging in other state elections as well as previous Delhi polls.This approach likely resonated with a broader segment of the population, including those who may not have been inclined to support a religiously charged campaign. By focusing on issues such as corruption and governance, the BJP effectively undermined AAP's credibility and appealed to a wider range of voters.The BJP also focused on hyper-local issues such as air pollution, traffic, and public safety, and engaged with local Resident Welfare Associations. They also promoted central government schemes.The BJP also targeted specific demographics, including Purvanchalis and slum dwellers, and utilised an aggressive digital campaign with AI-enhanced content and memes targeting AAP.The BJP's consistent performance in the Lok Sabha polls in Delhi indicated a latent voter base that the party successfully mobilised this time around for the assembly elections.Despite AAP's strong performance in the assembly elections, the BJP had consistently swept Lok Sabha elections in the national capital, winning all seven seats.This pre-existing support base provided a foundation for the BJP's campaign and likely contributed to their victory.The BJP also strategically fielded Parvesh Verma, a strong Jat leader, in the New Delhi constituency, signaling their intention to win back the confidence of the Jat community, which had previously favoured AAP in Delhi elections.During the Delhi Assembly elections, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi launched strong criticisms against Arvind Kejriwal, which may have been payback for events in Haryana. Gandhi's attacks covered a range of issues, including alleged corruption, unfulfilled promises, and inaction on key issues.Like the BJP, Gandhi attacked Kejriwal over the alleged liquor scam and accused him of living in a ""Sheesh Mahal"" while engaging in corrupt practices.Gandhi said that Kejriwal made false promises, ""similar to Prime Minister Narendra Modi"", particularly regarding cleaning the Yamuna River. He also challenged Kejriwal to drink Delhi's tap water, implying it was still polluted despite promises to clean it.The Aam Aadmi Party's (AAP) win in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) in 2022 proved to be a double-edged sword, ultimately hurting the party instead of helping it. AAP had promised a cleaner city with world-class roads, but it fell short on both accounts. The MCD House was in limbo, and the Standing Committee, which controls all financial powers, was never formed. The AAP repeatedly accused the Centre of creating hurdles through the Lieutenant Governor and stalling projects.This time around, voters held the AAP accountable for the deteriorating civic infrastructure across Delhi.AAP's performance in the MCD was a letdown for the people of Delhi. The party failed to address critical issues such as clearing garbage, repairing roads, and cleaning clogged sewers. Erratic water supply and overflowing sewers that were never repaired because Rs 4,000 crore for the Delhi Jal Board was not released further hurt the party.Senior party leaders stated that the MCD functioning had collapsed under the AAP, and no work was being done, leading to frustration among councillors.The steady departure of senior leaders from AAP over time might have also weakened the party's organisational structure and public image.The exit of prominent figures like Prashant Bhushan, Yogendra Yadav, Mayank Gandhi, and Kumar Vishwas, who had dared to disagree with Arvind Kejriwal, and repeatedly accused Kejriwal of having an ""autocratic"" style of leadership.Resignation of senior leaders like Kailash Gahlot, who cited the party's focus on political agenda over fulfilling promises, along with internal challenges, signalled internal discord.The BJP had termed Gahlot's resignation a ""courageous move"".Negative campaigning by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) centered on issues like Yamuna River pollution, the Delhi Police, and the Election Commission (EC) may have affected public perception of the AAP government.In the lead up to the polls, Kejriwal accused the BJP-led Haryana government of poisoning the Yamuna River, which supplies drinking water to Delhi. He claimed that the Haryana government deliberately sent polluted waters to Delhi to create an artificial water scarcity and blame the AAP.The AAP also repeatedly levelled accusations of voter fraud and irregularities against the BJP as well as the EC.AAP alleged that the Election Commission and Delhi Police were shielding BJP workers and accused them of ""hooliganism"". Kejriwal wrote to the Chief Election Commissioner, expressing concern over the intimidation and harassment of AAP volunteers by BJP workers. The EC responded that no written complaints could be traced in most cases but assured that all registered complaints are investigated.Kejriwal further criticised the Election Commission for allegedly refusing to make Form 17C public, a document detailing the number of votes polled at each booth. AAP then launched a website, transparentelections.in, claiming to upload Form 17C data for all constituencies to present the data in an accessible format.The EC dismissed Kejriwal's claims regarding Form 17C, stating that copies had already been provided to polling agents at each booth after voting, as per Rule 49S of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961.","BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. Verma, 47, bagged 30,088 votes, while Kejriwal and Congress' Sandeep Dikshit got 25,999 votes and 4,568 votes. Kejriwal conceded his defeat and hoped that the BJP will fulfill all its promises.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118065596,imgsize-587609,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/118065596.jpg"

Hyundai announces record $20 billion investment in US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/hyundai-announces-record-20-billion-investment-in-us/articleshow/119452125.cms,"Trump: 'Tariffs very strongly work'

'More investments, more jobs, and more money'

South Korea’s Hyundai has unveiled a massive $20 billion investment in US manufacturing , including a $5 billion steel plant in Louisiana, marking the company’s first steel production facility in the country. The announcement was made on Monday at the White House, alongside US President Donald Trump, Hyundai chairman Euisun Chung, and Louisiana governor Jeff Landry.The $5.8 billion Louisiana plant, which will produce over 2.7 million metric tonnes of steel annually, is expected to create more than 1,400 jobs and supply steel to Hyundai’s auto plants in Alabama and Georgia.Chairman Chung called it the auto giant’s largest US investment ever.Hyundai's announcement comes as more global firms ramp up US investments amid tariff concerns. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Japan’s SoftBank, and Apple have all announced major expansion plans in the country. Apple recently pledged $500 billion to boost manufacturing and infrastructure across the US.Speaking at the White House, Trump linked the investment to his trade policies, saying, ""This investment is a clear demonstration that tariffs very strongly work."" His administration had previously introduced 25% tariffs on steel and aluminium imports and planned new levies on Asian and European car imports, set to take effect next month.Hyundai’s Euisun Chung acknowledged Trump’s role in the company’s decision, revealing that discussions about the US steel plant began in 2019 during a meeting in Seoul. He added that the announcement coinciding with Trump's second term made the moment ""even more special,"" CNN reported.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt praised the development on social media, writing, ""More investments, more jobs, and more money in the pockets of hardworking Americans – all thanks to President Trump’s economic policies.""While such investment pledges are common during new presidential terms, their success varies. Trump’s 2017 announcement of a $10 billion Foxconn factory in Wisconsin, expected to create 13,000 jobs, ultimately resulted in a scaled-down investment of $672 million, producing fewer than 1,500 jobs.Despite Trump's push to ""save"" the US auto industry, American factories already produce the majority of North American auto production. In 2023, US assembly plants built 10.2 million vehicles, compared to 4 million in Mexico and 1.3 million in Canada.With Trump’s next wave of tariffs set for 2 April, more companies are expected to shift production to the US to avoid trade penalties.","The $5.8 billion plant will produce over 2.7 million metric tonnes of steel annually.

Louis DeJoy, who led the US Postal Service for five years, stepped down on Monday amid the discussions by President Donald Trump and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency regarding the possibility of privatising the mail service.Doug Tulino, the Deputy Postmaster General, will serve as interim leader until the Postal Service Board of Governors selects a permanent successor.
