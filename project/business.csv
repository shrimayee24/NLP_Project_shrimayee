"70% of road deaths of adolescent, children on roads annually in lower- and middle-income countries: Unicef report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/70-of-road-deaths-of-adolescent-children-on-roads-annually-in-lower-and-middle-income-countries-unicef-report/articleshow/118370979.cms,"MARRAKECH: A little over 1.8 lakh children and adolescents below the age of 19 years lose their lives on the roads annually across the globe, which comes to around 500 deaths per day, and almost 70% of them occur in lower- and middle-income countries (LMICs), a report released by Unicef on Tuesday said.As per the report, Africa and south-east Asia face the highest burden of child and adolescent road traffic deaths . In India, around 9,500 persons below 18 years died in road crashes in 2023.The Unicef report released at the 4th ministerial conference said that the African region reports around 46% of all child fatalities as pedestrian-related. By contrast, in the European region, 50% of road deaths in this age group occurs among vehicle occupants.""Powered two-wheelers are prominent in South Asia, East Asia, and the Pacific, while they are much less so on the African continent and the Caribbean,” it said.The report highlighted how children and adolescents are more vulnerable on roads in the LMICs as the rate of road traffic death among children and adolescents are up to three times higher in these countries than in high-income nations. “LMICs often lack adequate infrastructural and safety measures, such as road markings, raised intersections, sidewalks and traffic lights, as well as enforced road safety policies, that are needed to protect young road users,” the report said.The findings of the global status report gains importance considering that there are 3.3 billion children and adolescents aged below 19 years and 90% of them live in LMICs.Highlighting several policy gaps such as only 37.2% of countries testing all drivers involved in a fatal collision for alcohol and 33.7% have set age and height criteria for child motorcycle passengers, the report has recommended enacting and enforcing legislation requiring a maximum speed limit of 30 kmph on roads around schools and legislation to reduce maximum speeds on all urban roads to a safe level.",A little over 1.8 lakh children and adolescents below the age of 19 years lose their lives on the roads annually across the globe.

Isro develops world’s largest vertical propellant mixer for rocket sold propellants,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/isro-develops-worlds-largest-vertical-propellant-mixer-for-rocket-sold-propellants/articleshow/118370967.cms,"NEW DELHI: In its quest for self-reliance within the space sector, Isro has announced the successful development of a 10-tonne ‘vertical planetary mixer’, the largest of its kind for solid propellants globally. This innovative equipment has been designed and manufactured in collaboration with the Central Manufacturing Technology Institute (CMTI) in Bengaluru.Solid propulsion plays a crucial role in Indian space transportation systems and vertical mixer is one of the critical equipment in production of a solid motor of a rocket. “Solid propellants are the backbone of rocket motors, and their production requires precise mixing of highly sensitive and hazardous ingredients,” Isro said, adding “the 10-tonne vertical mixer is the world’s largest solid propellant mixing equipment”.The formal handover of the 10-tonne mixer took place on Feb 13 at CMTI, Bengaluru, where the director of Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota, received the mixer from the CMTI director in the presence of Isro chairman V Narayanan. The new system is expected to play a crucial role in advancing India’s spaceflight capabilities.“Department of Space has undertaken multiple initiatives towards indigenous development of critical technologies, materials and machinery as part of ‘atma-nirbharata (self reliance)’ in space. Realisation of indigenous 10-tonne vertical mixer is a true testament to India’s growing technological prowess, self-reliance and unwavering commitment to innovation,” the space agency said.Solid rocket motors require precise mixing of sensitive and hazardous ingredients. The new vertical mixer will improve the efficiency and safety of this process. The mixer weighs about 150 tonnes with a length of 5.4 m, breadth of 3.3 m & height of 8.7 m. The development involves collaboration with academia and industries and has successfully completed factory-level acceptance tests.Isro said the mixer will significantly improve productivity, quality and throughput in heavy solid motor production.","Isro has announced the successful development of a 10-tonne ‘vertical planetary mixer’ The new system is expected to play a crucial role in advancing India’s spaceflight capabilities.

"India's first microbiological nanosat, developed by students, to find ways to keep astronauts healthy",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indias-first-microbiological-nanosat-developed-by-students-to-find-ways-to-keep-astronauts-healthy/articleshow/118370934.cms,"NEW DELHI: India's first microbiological nanosatellite RVSAT-1, which was launched on board Isro’s PSLV C-60 last December as part of the SPADEX/POEM-4 mission, has been designed and developed by a team of students of Bengaluru-based RV College of Engineering in order to explore the growth of the gut bacterium in space.For the students’ group Team Antariksh, RVSAT-1 is more than a student project: “It is a leap into the future of space exploration”. Success at each stage of tests of the nanosatellite bolstered the team’s confidence and brought the team closer to their dream of sending their work into space. And it was finally realised when RVSAT-1 was launched into space on Dec 30 last year from Sriharikota.Gut bacteria plays an important role in our health by helping control digestion and benefiting our immune system and many other aspects of health. To know how the gut bacteria functions in space will help Isro find ways to keep Indian astronauts healthy during space missions.H Nandish, a third-year aerospace student of the college who is engaged in RVSAT-1 project, told TOI, “Our satellite mission was only for three days. We collected a lot of data soon after the launch. The study was to measure the growth of gut bacterium, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, in space and how it behaved in zero gravity. Study of data will not only help in space medicine but will also provide clues for applications on Earth, such as advanced waste recycling systems and combating antibiotic resistance. Data will also help Isro find solutions to keep astronauts healthy for a long space journey.”“We will publish a research paper after finding results from our nanosatellite data and put the report in public domain for its use by Isro, academia and others,” Nandish said, adding “data will basically help in astronaut health, waste management and antibiotic development.”On growth of gut bacteria, Aditi Arun, project manager, who is also engaged in the satellite project, said, “The bacterial growth curve is plotted utilising optical density measurement. This gives a quantitative measure of the variation of growth patterns in space.”The journey of RVSAT-1 has been challenging. Miniaturising complex lab equipment like incubators and spectrophotometers into a 2-U nanosatellite was a daunting challenge for Team Antariksh. Its innovative design incorporated a state-of-the-art microfluidic set-up and a precise optical system.The payload's unique experiment, combining bacterial growth analysis with prebiotic supplementation, promises groundbreaking insights into maintaining astronaut gut health. RVSAT-1's development faced moments of uncertainty. The rigorous testing phase demanded the highest standards of precision and performance. Each test-thermal vacuum (T-VAC), vibration, 1,500g shock test, and electromagnetic interference and compatibility — simulated the harsh conditions of space, pushing the payload to its limits.Beyond the technical achievements, RVSAT-1 symbolises the power of collaboration and the boundless possibilities of student innovation.","India's first microbiological nanosatellite RVSAT-1 was launched on board Isro’s PSLV C-60 last December as part of the SPADEX/POEM-4 mission.

NEW DELHI: India and Qatar upgraded their ties to a strategic partnership as PM Narendra Modi held bilateral talks with the visiting Qatar Amir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, discussing ways to enhance cooperation in areas like trade, investment, energy and security. Qatar committed to investing $ 10 billion in India, as it announced Qatar Investment Authority will open an office in India.The leaders spoke about signing a bilateral Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement and agreed to double the current $ 14 billion bilateral trade in the next 5 years. Apart from the establishment of strategic partnership, 6 other deals were signed including a revised agreement for avoidance of double taxation and another for financial and economic collaboration. They also agreed agreed to expedite negotiations for the India-Qatar Bilateral Investment Treaty.Qatar is the 5th GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) country with which India has signed a strategic partnership agreement, after UAE, Saudi Arabia, Oman and Kuwait.Modi and Al-Thani discussed the West Asia situation, reiterating their respective positions on the Gaza situation and emphasising the need for dialogue and diplomacy to resolve conflicts. Qatar is a key player in Gaza ceasefire efforts and, as US President Donald Trump proposes a takeover of the Strip, its foreign ministry said Tuesday Palestinians will decide the future of Gaza. India has also reiterated its support for the 2-state solution after Trump announced his plan to relocate Palestinians to Jordan and Egypt.The leaders unequivocally condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations including cross-border terrorism and agreed to jointly combat the menace through bilateral and multilateral mechanisms.“They agreed to enhance cooperation in information and intelligence sharing, developing and exchanging experiences, best practices and technologies, capacity building and to strengthen cooperation in law enforcement, anti-money laundering, drug-trafficking, Cybercrime and other transnational crimes,’’ said the joint statement. Modi and the Amir spoke about promoting cooperation in cybersecurity, including prevention of use of cyberspace for terrorism and radicalisation.The Qatari leader had last year pardoned 85 Indian prisoners, including the 8 Indian navy veterans who had been sentenced to death for military espionage. Modi had personally thanked Al-Thani for their release during his visit to Doha last year but one of the men, Purnendu Tiwari, remains in Qatar because of a financial fraud case against him. A travel ban is said to have been imposed on him.“Regarding the Navy official who is still over there, I would like to just say his matter remains sub judice in the local courts in Qata,’’ said MEA Secretary Arun Chatterjee, who handled overseas Indian affairs. The official added that the PM appreciated the work that Amir has done for the protection and welfare of Indian citizens. Qatar is home to 800,000 Indian nationals.The official said that while talks are underway for an India- GCC FTA, India and Qatar at the bilateral level will look at the possibility of having an FTA in the future.According to the joint statement, Qatar commended the steps taken by India in ensuring a conducive environment for Foreign Direct Investment and Foreign Institutional Investment and expressed interest to explore investment opportunities in different sectors, including infrastructure, technology, manufacturing, food security and hospitality. “In this regard, the Qatar side announced a commitment to invest $ 10 billion in India,’ it said, adding Indian side also appreciated Qatar’s efforts in enhancing its investment environment and its initiatives to attract Foreign Direct Investment.“India also recognized Qatar’s growing role as a regional hub for goods and services, leveraging its strategic location, world-class infrastructure, and business-friendly policies,’’ said the statement.","Qatar committed to investing $ 10 billion in India, as it announced Qatar Investment Authority will open an office in India.

What’s next for Allahbadia?

NEW DELHI: A crude joke on India’s Got Latent , a show hosted by comedian Samay Raina, has landed YouTuber Ranveer Allahbadia—popularly known as BeerBiceps—into legal trouble. His comment about parents and sex, which went viral on February 10, sparked public outrage and multiple FIRs against him and fellow comedians Ashish Chanchlani, Jaspreet Singh, and Apoorva Makhija.Even as the Supreme Court shielded Allahbadia from immediate arrest on Tuesday, the judges did not hold back their criticism. ""This is vulgarity. You have a dirty mind,"" the bench observed, making it clear that legal immunity did not equate to moral approval.Multiple FIRs were lodged against Allahbadia across states, prompting senior advocate Abhinav Chandrachud to seek relief. The Supreme Court, while granting interim protection, made its disapproval clear.The court directed Allahbadia and his associates to halt any further shows until further orders, bluntly stating, “Stop this show business for the time being.”Chandrachud admitted he found Allahbadia’s words “disgusting” but questioned whether they warranted criminal prosecution. The bench fired back: “Does this judgment (on obscenity) give you a license to speak all kinds of vulgarity? Can he spew his depraved mind anywhere and anytime?""The case reignites the debate on free speech and comedy in India. From Kunal Kamra’s judiciary jabs to Munawar Faruqui’s jail time for alleged religious slander, comedians have repeatedly faced legal action. The court noted, “Society has self-evolved values. What are those parameters? We want to hear from the petitioner and other artists—how do you define your limits?”Allahbadia’s counsel cited threats from a former wrestler and legislator, which had made it unsafe for him to travel where FIRs were filed. The court dismissed this, saying, “If you seek cheap publicity with abusive language, someone issuing threats also wants to be popular.” However, it condemned vigilantism, asserting, “This is not a people’s court.

Vijay Mallya claims in London court that Indian banks pursuing him are ‘acting in bad faith’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/vijay-mallya-claims-in-london-court-that-indian-banks-pursuing-him-are-acting-in-bad-faith/articleshow/118365672.cms,"The TOI correspondent from London:

Fugitive Indian businessman Vijay Mallya ’s barrister told a London court that the banks pursuing Mallya are “acting in bad faith” and not being transparent as he made a failed attempt to adjourn Mallya’s appeal hearing against his bankruptcy order in the London high court on the first day of its hearing on Tuesday.Alastair Tomson, representing Mallya, told the court that Mallya's writ petition in the high court of Karnataka on Feb 5 could “soon” lead to “new evidence” relevant to whether the bankruptcy order should ever have been made and applied for the appeal hearing to be adjourned.Judge Sir Anthony Mann dismissed the adjournment application on the spot, questioning how long a case in India would take to reach its conclusion. “Anecdotal evidence shows me ‘soon’ in Indian courts is not necessarily soon. A lot of cases take a long time in India,” Mann said.He also did not allow late evidence from Mallya, which included the writ petition.Mallya was declared bankrupt by the insolvency and companies courtin London on July 26, 2021 for failing to clear a judgment debt of £1.05 billion (Rs 11,499 crore) determined by the Debt Recovery Tribunal, Karnataka, in 2017, which was registered in the English courts.Tomson said that Mallya believes that the State Bank of India (SBI)-led consortium pursued bankruptcy proceedings against him “in bad faith”, the banks have made recoveries which “satisfied the judgment debt twice over”, and incorrect information was given in various proceedings.He said Mallya believes the “consortium has concealed and misrepresented the details of recoveries made” and that there is “no accountability of the assets recovered.” He said they have suppressed facts and at the same time taken advantage of accruing interest, which is “unprecedented in debt recovery”. “The intent of these extortionate actions is to recover far in excess of what is due to the petitioners, which is arbitrary, unlawful and unconstitutional,” Tomson said.Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman made a statement in Parliament in Dec 2024 detailing banks had recovered Rs 14,131.6 crore from Mallya. This triggered Mallya to write to the chief manager of SBI on Dec 24, 2024, in which he criticised the way banks got a worldwide freeze order against him in and asserted that SBI was involved in “deception” by realising his assets whilst allowing interest on the judgment debt to accrue, Tomson said. SBI has not responded.Tony Beswetherick KC, representing the banks, opposed the adjournment and new evidence and said there is no evidence the Karnataka high court will grant the relief sought.Mallya (69) switched law firms last week and instructed Zaiwalla & Co.The chancery division of the high court is hearing three appeals combined into one hearing this week. The banks are appealing having to file an amended bankruptcy petition whilst Mallya is appealing the bankruptcy order and the amended petition.","Mallya was declared bankrupt by the insolvency and companies courtin London on July 26, 2021 for failing to clear a judgment debt of £1.05 billion.

Poll How Can Water Contamination Risks Be Addressed at Major Events? Raise Public Awareness on Health Risks Improve Water Quality and Monitoring

What is faecal coliform?

'Increase in faecal concentration'

'High levels of faecal and total coliform at various locations'

'Quality of Ganga water not good for bathing'

'People back from Kumbh experiencing medical issues'

'

Respiratory tract infections

due to crowded settings'

NEW DELHI: Water quality at several locations in Uttar Pradesh's Prayagraj during the ongoing Maha Kumbh did not meet primary bathing standards due to high faecal coliform levels, a report by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) informed the National Green Tribunal on Monday.According to the CPCB,—a key indicator of sewage contamination—should not exceed the permissible limit of 2,500 units per 100 ml.Faecal coliform bacteria are a group of microorganisms found in the intestines of humans and animals. Their presence in water indicates contamination from sewage or animal waste. While not all coliform bacteria are harmful, their detection raises concerns about the potential presence of dangerous pathogens like viruses, Salmonella, and E. coli.A tribunal panel, headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Prakash Shrivastava and comprising Judicial Member Justice Sudhir Agarwal and Expert Member A Senthil Vel, reviewed measures to prevent sewage discharge into the Ganga and Yamuna rivers in Prayagraj. The bench took note of a CPCB report dated February 3, highlighting certain non-compliances and violations.""The river water quality was not conforming to the primary water quality for bathing with respect to faecal coliform (FC) at all the monitored locations on various occasions. A large number of people bathe in the river at Prayagraj during the Mahakumbh Mela, including on auspicious bathing days, which eventually leads to an increase in faecal concentration,"" the report said.The tribunal noted that UPPCB had not submitted a comprehensive action taken report as previously directed, instead providing only a covering letter with water test results.""Even upon reviewing the documents enclosed with the covering letter dated January 28, 2025, sent by the in-charge of the central laboratory, UPPCB, it is reflected that high levels of faecal and total coliform have been found at various locations,"" it continued.The counsel for Uttar Pradesh received one day to examine and respond to the report. The tribunal instructed the UPPCB Member Secretary and relevant state authority responsible for Ganga water quality at Prayagraj to attend the next virtual hearing scheduled for February 19.Speaking to news agency PTI, Jyotish Peeth Shankaracharya Swami Avimukteshwaranand Saraswati said: ""The National Green Tribunal had highlighted this even before the Kumbh started that the quality of Ganga and Yamuna waters was not good for bathing. They had also issued certain directions, especially on controlling the flow drains into the river. 40-50 crore people are taking bath there, it is being advertised all over the world, but the basic facility of clean water for bathing is not being provided.""While in a separate video, a Senior Consultant in Internal Medicine at Indraprastha Apollo Hospital, Delhi, told news agency ANI: ""We are definitely seeing people with medical problems who are coming back from Kumbh, but obviously in a place which has so many people taking a dip in the water. We would expect that this would happen. The number of people who are coming with medical problems is much less as compared to the volume of people that are going over there.""That way, I think the control is very good, but yes, people are definitely coming with something like what we call gastroenteritis , where they're having loose motions, vomiting, and all that. They're having a fever of unspecific or unspecified origin. Most probably, they're viral fevers that are happening,"" the expert warned.The Senior Consultant said that many people returning from Kumbh are experiencing respiratory tract infections which is a common ailment in crowded settings.""Quite a few people are suffering from respiratory tract infections, like a runny nose, sneezing, cough, and cold, which is obviously very common. When you go to such a crowded place, and then you take a dip, which might be at 3 am in the morning, you can get exposed to this cold,"" he continued.He further advised the ""people to carry their own water, maybe water from home or maybe bottles of water, and they should drink water from a good place or carry their own bottles"".""The second thing is to eat food from a healthy place and eat cooked food rather than raw food, wear a mask and try to keep people at a distance...Do not drink the water while taking a dip in the river,"" the doctor added.","Water quality at several locations in Uttar Pradesh's Prayagraj during the ongoing Maha Kumbh did not meet primary bathing standards due to high faecal coliform levels, a report by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) informed the National Green Tribunal on Monday.

CEC appointment: Rahul fires 'midnight decision' salvo; BJP questions Cong's past 'pliant picks',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cec-appointment-rahul-fires-midnight-decision-salvo-bjp-questions-congs-past-pliant-picks/articleshow/118361284.cms,"So, why is the new appointment process under judicial scrutiny?

What did Rahul say in his dissent note

'Congress acting like cry baby'

SC hearing tomorrow

NEW DELHI: Gyanesh Kumar will take over as the 26th Chief Election Commissioner tomorrow - on a day the Supreme Court will hear a petition challenging the 2023 law under which his appointment was made by the Centre late on Monday night.The appointment, which is the first under the new law, was made by a selection panel which included Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union home minister Amit Shah and leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi . The Congress leader objected to the selection process citing tomorrow's SC hearing and presented a dissenting note to the panel.The Centre's move triggered a war of words between the BJP and the Congress. While the Congress claimed that the midnight appointment by PM and HM was both ""disrespectful and discourteous,"" the BJP asserted that no rules were broken and accused the grand old party of acting like cry babies. The BJP also questioned the appointment of past ECs under the Congress regime and cited how they were rewarded by the grand old party.On March 2, 2023, a five-judge SC bench had directed that a panel comprising the PM, leader of opposition (LoP) and Chief Justice of India would advise the President on appointment of CEC and election commissioners. SC had said its order would hold good until the Centre came up with a law to lay down a mechanism for the selection.The apex court's verdict also held that leaving the appointment of the ECs and CEC in the hands of the executive would be detrimental to the health of the country's democracy and the holding of free and fair elections.After the SC verdict, the Centre notified a new legislation for appointment of CEC and ECs in August 2023 and Parliament passed the Bill in December 2023. Under the Centre's new law the CJI in selection panel was replaced with a Union minister alongside the PM and LoP.This effectively made the Election Commission appointments at the discretion of the government and hence was challenged in the apex court. The petitioners contended that the Election Commission should be insulated from ""political"" and ""executive interference"" for maintaining a healthy democracy.In his dissent note presented before the selection panel, Rahul Gandhi cited the speech of B R Ambedkar while speaking in the Constituent Assembly in June 1949 to discuss the setting up of an independent Election Commission, where he had warned about executive interference in India's democracy and the affairs of the Election Commission.The Congress leader said the SC March 2, 2023 verdict reflected the larger concern among hundreds of millions of voters over the integrity of our electoral process. This is also reflected in public surveys that show a continuing decline in trust of voters in India's election process and its institutions.He further claimed that the government's legislation bypassed the spirit and the letter of the Supreme Court's order. Citing the hearing in apex court, he urged that the process of choosing the next CEC be deferred and the meeting be postponed.The Congress said that by removing the chief justice of India from the selection committee, the government has made it clear it wants control and not to preserve the credibility of the Election Commission.The BJP dismissed Rahul Gandhi's criticism as ""politically motivated"" and accused him of undermining an elected government's constitutional mandate through ""malicious"" judicial activism. BJP's IT department head Amit Malviya said Rahul's dissent on the appointment of the chief election commissioner (CEC) is not just politically motivated but also lacks merit. He also accused the Congress of conveniently misreading and misinterpreting the Supreme Court's judgment on the CEC's appointment.Attacking the Congress, he said the party and the Gandhis, in particular, should be the last to sermonise on the appointment of the CEC, given their record of ""abusing the office, appointing pliant candidates, and later doling out political appointments to incumbents as a reward for their services after stepping down"". The BJP leader also shared a list of several former CECs who were later given different positions or honoured with Padma awards by the then government.BJP leader and Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan also attacked Rahul and said ""Congress Party crushed the Constitution at their convenience to serve their political interests. Congress never left an opportunity to ridicule and insult Baba Saheb Ambedkar, yet the Yuvraj of Congress has the audacity to take a grandstand on upholding Baba Saheb's ideals and that of our founding leaders.""""This latest jig by @RahulGandhi is another attempt to create controversy and peddle propaganda on the appointment of CEC. Has Rahul Gandhi forgotten how ECs were appointed during Congress rule? Despite being in power for decades why did Congress govt do nothing to reform the selection mechanism?"" he asked.The education minister further stated, ""As a matter of fact, this is the first time that CEC has been appointed by a law passed in the Parliament. It is our govt. that has created a joint system for the appointment of CEC and EC, which includes the LoP. It is a great misfortune that Rahul Gandhi and Congress Party are acting like cry babies even when no rule/law is broken"".It will be interesting to see what is the Supreme Court's take on the issue when a bench of Justices Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh hears the petitions against the Centre's amended law. The apex court had in January this year said that examining the validity of the 2023 law would boil down to a contest between Parliament's power to legislate on the selection framework and SC's power as a constitutional court.On March 15, 2024, the top court had refused to stay the appointments of the new ECs under the 2023 law.On February 12 this year, the top court had fixed February 19 to hear pleas against the appointment of the CEC and EC under the 2023 law saying if anything happens in the interregnum, the consequences were bound to follow.It had said the issue would be decided on merit.(With inputs from agencies)",Gyanesh Kumar will take over as the 26th Chief Election Commissioner tomorrow. The Supreme Court will hear a petition challenging the 2023 law under which his appointment was made. The Centre's move triggered a war of words between the BJP and the Congress.

To secure the deal, he handed over an advance agreement for an acre of his land. His journey began in November 2022, when he was first sent to Dubai. After spending nearly 18 months there, he returned to India, only to be sent to South Africa for four-and-a-half months.From there, he was taken to Brazil on August 26 last year and embarked on a treacherous route through multiple countries. The journey involved walking through dense forests, crossing rivers, and surviving on minimal food. Eventually, he reached Mexico, where he was forced to stay for a month while his travel agent coerced his wife into signing over his land. Finally, he crossed into the US on January 27, only to be caught and detained by US Border Patrol. ""I was given only a bottle of water, a packet of chips, and an apple daily,"" he told PTI.Sourav, a 20-year-old from Punjab's Ferozepur district, also shared his harrowing experience. His family spent Rs 45-46 lakh to send him to the US, selling farmland and borrowing money from relatives. ""We were kept in a camp (detention centre) for 18 days,"" he said. ""A day before our deportation, we were told that we would be shifted to another camp. When we boarded the plane, they said we were being taken to India.""Sourav had travelled through Amsterdam, Panama, and Mexico before attempting to cross the border on January 27.

Lupex marches on

BENGALURU: Chandrayaan-4 India’s planned lunar sample return mission that aims to soft land near the Moon’s south pole, collect samples from the lunar surface, and return them to Earth for analysis will have a mass of approximately 9,200kg compared to Chandrayaan-3’s 3,900kg.Since Isro ’s current capability to lift payloads to geotransfer orbit (GTO) is limited to about 4,500 kg, the mission will require two separate launches: Two modules will be launched in one stack, three modules will be launched in another stack. These launches will be conducted using the LVM-3 vehicle with a one-month gap between them.In an exclusive interview to TOI, Isro chairman V Narayanan explained how multiple dockings will be carried out, and also gave details on Chandrayaan-5 , the joint mission with Japan, also called Lupex (Lunar Polar Exploration Mission).“We have completed the configuration design and now the design of various subsystems is ongoing,” Narayanan said, adding that the mission architecture involves multiple docking and undocking manoeuvres in both Earth and lunar orbits.According to Narayanan, after the two launches, the initial docking of modules will occur in Earth orbit. A propulsion module will then transport the spacecraft to lunar orbit (separating at around 1-lakh-km from Moon). In the lunar orbit, four modules will remain after propulsion module separation and two modules, including the ascending module will separate and land on Moon.After sample collection, one module will return and dock with the remaining modules in lunar orbit, the sample will be transferred to a re-entry module and the re-entry module will return to Earth with the samples.“The mission requires development of new technologies, including a high-capacity propulsion system, specialised payloads, and robotic arms for sample collection. Work on all of this is going on,” Narayanan said.Elaborating on Lupex, which India will designate as Chandrayaan-5, Narayanan said the landing mass of the spacecraft will be 6,200kg and the rover on Lupex will weigh 350-400kg compared to Chandrayaan-3’s 26kg.For Lupex, Japan will be responsible for the development and operation of the launch vehicle and rover, while India will be responsible for the development and operation of the lander. Aside from Indian and Japanese instruments, Lupex will also carry American, and European instruments.“After the project was approved, configuration study has been completed, and teams are now working on hardware design and development,” Narayanan said. TOI had reported earlier that Lupex will need Isro to work on a heavier lander engine, which Narayanan confirmed. He said work had already begun on that.In the first week of Feb, Jaxa, Japan’s space agency updated its mission page on Lupex to add details about the rover payloads. As per Jaxa, the rover will carry seven main payloads.The first payload, Resource Investigating Water Analyser (REIWA) will have the Lunar Thermogravimetric Analyser (LTGA), Triple-reflection Reflectron (Triton), Aquatic Detector using Optical Resonance (ADORE) and Isro Sample Analysis Package (Isap).The other six payloads are: Advanced Lunar Imaging Spectrometer (Alis), Neutron Spectrometer (NS), Exospheric Mass Spectrometer for Lupex (EMS-L), Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR), Mid-Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (MIR) and Permittivity and Thermophysical Investigation for Moon's Aquatic Scout (Prathima).","Chandrayaan-4 India’s planned lunar sample return mission will have a mass of approximately 9,200kg.

Delhi Earthquake News: Why did the 4.0-magnitude earthquake in Delhi-NCR feel so strong?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-did-the-4-0-magnitude-earthquake-in-delhi-ncr-feel-so-strong/articleshow/118315557.cms,"Why did the tremors feel so strong?



Epicentre within Delhi: Since the earthquake originated beneath the city, seismic waves had less distance to travel, making the tremors feel more intense.

Shallow depth: Earthquakes that occur closer to the Earth's surface generate stronger shaking compared to deeper quakes of similar magnitude.

Urban infrastructure: High-rise buildings in Delhi, Noida, and Ghaziabad sway more due to their height, amplifying the sensation of shaking.

Soil composition: Soft alluvial soil in some areas of Delhi can amplify seismic waves, further intensifying the tremors.

Why did the earthquake occur?

How earthquake intensity changes with magnitude





Also See: Earthquake in Delhi

NEW DELHI: Residents of Delhi-NCR and several parts of northern India were jolted awake early Monday morning as strong tremors shook high-rise buildings , prompting many to rush outside. The earthquake, measuring 4.0 on the Richter scale, struck at 5:36 AM IST with its epicentre located within Delhi's Dhaula Kuan, according to the National Centre for Seismology (NCS).Though a 4.0-magnitude quake is considered moderate, its impact felt stronger than usual because of its shallow depth and close proximity to densely populated areas. Earthquakes with epicentres within a city result in more intense shaking since seismic waves travel a shorter distance before reaching structures, amplifying the tremors.Delhi, which falls in Seismic Zone IV , is prone to moderate-to-strong earthquakes, making localised tremors more pronounced as the. Experts noted that buildings, particularly high-rises, sway more due to their design, increasing the perceived intensity of shaking.Authorities have reported no major damage or casualties, but the sudden tremors sparked concern among residents. Seismologists continue to monitor aftershocks and have advised citizens to stay informed about earthquake preparedness measures.However, National Centre for Seismology Director OP Mishra said, ""The epicentre was at Jheel Park in Dhaula Kuan, it was a 4.0 magnitude earthquake . It was in the depth of 5 km, it is called shallow depth, hence people felt the effect. People getting panicked was natural. Seismologically, it is not new region, earthquakes have happened earlier in the region. Earlier, there was 4.6 magnitude earthquake in 6 km periphery, but it was deeper, with 10 km depth. There is a difference. It was not a plate tectonic earthquake, it was due to in situ material heterogeneity, it was due to local effect. We can expect aftershock of around 1 or 1.2 magnitude.""See how close were you from the epicenter: Dhaula Kuan Delhi sits near active fault lines, including the Delhi-Hardwar Ridge and the Mahendragarh-Dehradun fault, making it prone to moderate seismic activity. The tremors were caused by tectonic plate movement along one of these fault lines, where stress builds up over time and is eventually released as an earthquake.The intensity of an earthquake is measured on the logarithmic Richter scale, where each whole-number increase represents a tenfold increase in the amplitude of seismic waves and about 32 times more energy release. This means that even small changes in magnitude can have a dramatic impact.For instance, an earthquake of magnitude 4.0 produces 10 times stronger shaking and releases 32 times more energy than a 3.0. Similarly, a 5.0-magnitude earthquake shakes 10 times more than a 4.0 and releases 32 times more energy. By the time an earthquake reaches magnitude 6.0, the shaking is 1,000 times stronger than a 3.0, and the energy released is 32,000 times greater. This exponential increase is why a seemingly small rise in magnitude can lead to severe destruction, especially in urban areas.","Residents of Delhi-NCR and northern India were jolted awake early Monday morning as strong tremors shook high-rise buildings. The earthquake, measuring 4.0 on the Richter scale, struck at 5:36 AM IST with its epicentre located within Delhi's Dhaula Kuan. Authorities have reported no major damage or casualties, but the sudden tremors sparked concern among residents.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118319192,imgsize-4133549,width-400,resizemode-4/118319192.jpg"

All of them corroborated the fact that cash was paid to the hawala dealers and ‘entries' (unsecured loans) were received in shell companies"".ED had claimed that these five shell companies spent Rs 27.69 crore to acquire the land parcels. Jain was a minister in the AAP govt in Delhi from December 28, 2013 to February 14, 2014 and again from February 2015 till much after his arrest in 2022.","President Droupadi Murmu on Tuesday granted sanction to the Enforcement Directorate (ED) to prosecute AAP leader and former Delhi minister Satyendar Jain.

However, CPCB found that by Jan 19, total coliform levels had reached a whopping 700,000 MPN/100ml in the Ganga and 330,000 MPN/100ml in the Yamuna. It analysed the samples on Jan 12, 13, 14, 15 and 19, and the total coliform levels never met standards.CPCB findings not only indicated non-compliance with NGT's earlier directive to maintain critical water quality standards, but also raised concerns over public health and environmental sustainability, the tribunal's principal bench, headed by its chairperson Justice Prakash Shirvastava, noted during a hearing on Feb 17.The high levels of faecal bacteria in the waters pose significant risks of waterborne diseases, while excessive organic pollution threatens aquatic life and overall river health.Pointing out that UP Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) had not filed any comprehensive action taken report, as directed by tribunal in Dec last year, the bench ordered the board's member secretary and the state authority responsible for maintaining water quality in river Ganga at Prayagraj to appear before it virtually during the next hearing on Feb 19.NGT had in Dec asked CPCB and UPPCB to monitor and report the water quality regularly, while also ensuring that untreated sewage did not flow into the two rivers so that the pilgrims who came for a holy bath did not suffer. It directed the agencies to analyse water samples from the rivers at least twice a week at regular intervals.In compliance, CPCB submitted its report, which said river water quality did not conform to the bathing criteria at all the monitored locations on various occasions.","The Sangam waters where millions of devotees have been taking a holy dip every day during the ongoing Maha Kumbh has been found to be contaminated with alarming levels of faecal and total coliform.

NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trump on Wednesday asked the purpose behind providing $21 million to India for ""voter turnout"" and said that the country is ""one of the highest taxing countries in the world"". This came after Elon Musk-led DOGE’s (Department of Government Efficiency) disclosed that USAID contributed $21 million to EC allegedly for boosting voter turnout.""Why are we giving $21 million to India? They have a lot more money. They are one of the highest taxing countries in the world in terms of us; we can hardly get in there because their tariffs are so high,"" he asked while signing executive orders at Mar-a-Lago.Categorically mentioning that he had ""a lot of respect"" for PM Narendra Modi, Trump questioned the funding. ""I have a lot of respect for India and their prime minister, but giving $21 million for voter turnout?"" he said. The two leaders recently held bilateral talks where they discussed trade, illegal immigration, defence and energy, among other key sectors.The Musk-led department had last week shared a list of areas from where it had decided to revoke the US aid. One of those included -- ""$21M for voter turnout in India"" -- prompting political slugfest between the BJP and the Congress in the country.The BJP has renewed its call for an investigation into the matter. Meanwhile, former CEC SY Quraishi clarified that while the Election Commission had an understanding with USAID, no financial assistance was involved.“So, DOGE has discovered that USAID allocated $21 million for ‘voter turnout’ in India, a euphemism for paying voters to cast their votes to effect regime change. Veena Reddy was sent to India in 2021 (ominous?) as head of USAID’s Indian mission. Post Lok Sabha elections 2024 (presumably her voter turnout mission done), she returned to US. Pity because investigating agencies here could have asked her some questions about who this money was given to for applying it to voter turnout operations,” BJP MP Mahesh Jethmalani said.The Congress party has also condemned foreign interference in India's electoral process, urging the Modi government to probe USAID’s claims and take action if any wrongdoing is uncovered.","US President Donald Trump asked the purpose behind providing $21 million to India for ""voter turnout"" He said that the country is ""one of the highest taxing countries in the world"" The BJP has renewed its call for an investigation into the matter.

The 'trial in absentia' provision is expected to facilitate trial in terror cases in J&K, given that the main accused in these cases - masterminds heading foreign terror outfits and handlers of the arrested accused - operate from safe havens in Pakistan or Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.By virtue of Section 355 and 356 of the BNSS, Pakistan-based terror masterminds can be put on trial in India and the judgment pronounced in their absence.Shah directed J&K authorities to ensure the full implementation of the new criminal laws - BNSS, Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita and Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam - by April.Sources in the J&K LG's office said the infrastructure and systems required for 100% rollout of the new laws - across pillars of criminal justice like police, prisons, prosecution, courts and forensics - are at an advanced stage of readiness. The training of the J&K Police in the new criminal justice system is nearly 72% complete, they added. Shah has asked this to be completed at the earliest.Briefing reporters after the meeting, Abdullah said while implementation of the criminal laws is not his mandate (with law and order being the LG's domain), his govt does have a role in spreading awareness about the laws across universities, colleges, and in social and political circles.During the meeting - attended by DGs of the Bureau of Police Research and Development and the National Crime Records Bureau - Shah stressed on the need for the J&K Police to focus on safeguarding the rights of citizens, with terror activities on the wane and the improving security scenario in the UT.He said the process of filing of chargesheets must be expedited and decisions on invoking provisions related to terrorism and organised crime taken after scrutiny at the level of superintendent of police, to prevent any misuse.",Home minister Amit Shah said J&K must urgently use the new provision in the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS) The provision allows 'trial in absentia' of an accused declared as a proclaimed offender and who has absconded to evade trial.

They are given age relaxation by 3 years while SC/ST candidates get 5 years' relaxation in upper age limit.The division bench comprising Chief Justice Suresh Kumar Kait and Justice Vivek Jain deferred hearing of the case to Feb 24 while directing all the parties to present their arguments in writing by then.In the Feb 14 interim order, HC had directed UPSC to allow EWS candidates to fill the form for Civil Services Exam with 5-year relaxation in maximum age limit and also allow them 9 attempts, as provided to candidates of other reserved classes. The final results of these candidates will, however, be subject to the final verdict of the court, said the bench.The petitioner, Aditya Narayan Pandey and 15 other UPSC aspirants, have questioned why EWS applicants don't get the same benefits in age relaxation and number of attempts as other reserved classes.UPSC has advertised 979 posts for Civil Services Exam 2025 and the prelims is on May 25. The petition argues that EWS candidates should have parity with candidates of other reserved classes and should not be clubbed with general category candidates in terms of eligibility criteria.On Feb14, counsel for Union govt and UPSC sought time to file objections to the petition but the bench said: ""Since the last date to fill up forms is approaching, we deem it appropriate to permit the petitioner to apply for the same.

In one such appeal case, it had said, ""Inclusion of a condition for payment of money by the applicant for bail tends to create an impression that bail could be secured by depositing money alleged to have been cheated.

However, in court, he admitted under cross-examination that they had used a shop's scales. The result: Ashok Kumar alias 'Kakka' Kumar walked free. The seizure took place on Nov 11, 2019, at LGN Road-Gopal Dass Road junction following a tip-off that Kumar was in possession of ganja. Police searched him in the fruit market and claimed to have seized 1.5kg of ganja.After the seizure, 50 grams of ganja were sent to a forensic lab, while the remaining quantity was packed and sealed. However, police took 61 days to submit the seized narcotic to the court, raising doubts about the integrity of its handling. The NDPS Act mandates that police should carry their own weighing machines, testing kits, and packing materials to ensure proper evidence collection at the scene of seizure. The trial court cited contradictions in the prosecution's evidence and ruled in favour of the accused. Principal Special Judge S Hermies found the recovery process unreliable and dismissed the case.This isn't an isolated case - Chennai police have repeatedly skipped carrying weighing machines, leading to acquittals.

The law included a Cabinet minister in the panel, excluding the Chief Justice of India.Advocate Prashant Bhushan requested a bench of Justices Surya Kant and N K Singh to take up the hearing on the petitions, which are almost at the fag end of the list of cases scheduled to be heard on Wednesday, to be taken on priority and for issuance of instructions to that effect to the SC officials concerned. The bench declined to issue any direction but said it would hear the matters.A little later, solicitor general Tushar Mehta sought adjournment of a petition on alleged encounter killings in Assam, a case in which the petitioner is represented by Bhushan, which the bench agreed to.Bhushan said the Assam encounter case can be adjourned but the matter relating to the EC selection process cannot wait as it is very important for holding free and fair elections .A five-judge SC bench on March 2, 2023 in the Anoop Baranwal case had noticed a vacuum in parliamentary legislation on the process for selection of CEC and ECs and directed that a panel comprising the Prime Minister, the leader of the opposition and the Chief Justice of India would advise the President on appointments to the Election Commission of India. The bench said this court-crafted panel will continue to operate till Parliament enacts a law in this regard.In Dec 2023, both Houses of Parliament passed the Chief Election Commissioner and other Election Commissioners (Appointment, Conditions of Officer and Terms of Office) Bill, which became a law on getting the President's assent on Dec 29, 2023. The law replaced Chief Justice of India with a Union Cabinet minister (to be nominated by the PM) in the committee.Many petitions were immediately filed before Supreme Court alleging that the law violated the spirit of the SC judgment, which was to maintain the independence of ECI. On Jan 12, 2024, a bench of Justices Sanjiv Khanna (now CJI) and Dipankar Datta refused to stay the operation of the legislation.The CJI has recused from hearing PILs on the ground that these are seeking CJI's inclusion in the selection panel.","Supreme Court to conduct final hearing on petitions challenging validity of law.

I'll choose my academic stream based on my board results,"" said the 15-year-old whose parents are agricultural labourers.The turmoil in her life was unleashed just 11 days after her rousing Republic Day speech on the importance of saving the girl child and educating her. The 33-year-old schoolteacher allegedly assaulted her after luring her to a hotel on the pretence of his birthday celebrations. He is also accused of threatening to fail her in the board exam.Ever since the Feb 7 horror, the girl has been living with her father's sister, who has two exam-facing daughters. ""We don't want people and relatives streaming in daily and disturbing her studies,"" her uncle said.As she maintains the same unwavering dedication to her studies as she did before her ordeal, immense emotional support has come from her two cousins, who study alongside her, offering her company in these trying times. ""We are incredibly proud of her courage and determination. We will support her every step of the way, regardless of the challenges that lie ahead,"" said her uncle.Living in a joint family, most members make a living as agricultural labourers. ""We don't want our future generation to toil as farm hands. After all, we are not landowners. We realise the importance of education,"" her uncle asserted. The praise isn't limited to the family as the girl is seen as a beacon of resilience for countless others who falter when faced with far lesser challenges.The principal of her grant-in-aid school is among a growing list of those applauding her fortitude - just as the Jan 26 audience did. ""She has been a bright student who never missed classes. It's inspirational, to say the least, the way she is navigating these challenging times with courage and resilience,"" the principal told TOI.","The 15-year-old was allegedly raped by her teacher days after winning deafening applause for her Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao speech at a Jan 26 event in her village school in Gujarat's Sabarkantha.

This is the first visit by the Amir to India in nine years.Al-Thani joined a select group of people, which includes former US President Barak Obama, Donald Trump during his first presidency, former Japanese PM Shinzo Abe and UAE President Mohamed Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, who have been given that honour by Modi.In a major reprieve for India last year, Al-Thani had pardoned eight Indian Navy veterans who had been arrested by Qatari authorities for military espionage. While seven have come back to India, one is yet to return.Commander Purnendu Tiwari (retd) is still in Qatar apparently because of a travel ban. The eight men had been sentenced to death but later had it commuted to imprisonment.

Vance: Fact check: JD Vance's free speech attack claims debunked,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/fact-check-jd-vances-free-speech-attack-claims-debunked/articleshow/118345177.cms,"US Vice President JD Vance has attacked Europe over free speech, citing several instances where people weren't allowed to express themselves online or pray in public and at home. Are the claims smoke and mirrors?During his recent visit at the Munich Security Conference in Germany, US Vice President JD Vance claimed European freedom of speech was in decline. DW's Team Fact check takes a closer look at some of his examples and provides context surrounding these cases.Claim: The Scottish government has allegedly warned citizens that praying at home could be illegal. ""The Scottish government began distributing letters to citizens whose houses lay within so-called Safe Access Zones, warning them that even private prayer within their own homes may amount to breaking the law,"" Vance said. ""Naturally, the government urged readers to report any fellow citizens suspected guilty of thought crime.""DW Fact check: Misleading.While it is true that Scotland introduced so-called Safe Access Zones within 200 meters (about 650 feet) of abortion clinics in September 2024 and banned ""silent prayer"" and similar pressure-building activities to keep women from going through with abortions, silent prayer at home with no distress to others is not included in the ban.However, the law does stipulate that even activities that can be seen or heard within the zone and are ""done intentionally or recklessly"" in a private place within the area (like a house) between the protected premises and the boundary of a zone could be an offense.It's a common tactic by US anti-abortion activists, so-called ""pro-lifers,"" to gather in front of abortion clinics, handing out fliers, showing photos of fetuses or using the cover of prayer to intimidate women entering the clinics to pressure them into keeping the baby.""This is shocking and shameless misinformation from Vice President JD Vance,"" said Gillian Mackay, Member of the Scottish Parliament on X, who had introduced the Safe Access Zones bill.She said that while the letter encouraged people to report anything they thought violated the law, the police would give the same encouragement for every other law in the country.""The letter was sent to households to inform them of what the zones mean for them. As we discussed in the passage of the Act, no individual behavior is criminalized. Silent prayer or praying in your own home are not illegal as stated by the VP,"" she wrote on X. ""This is simply scaremongering.""Claim: A British man was charged for silently praying in front of an abortion clinic on behalf of an unborn son he and his former girlfriend had aborted, Vance said. ""A little over two years ago, the British government charged Adam Smith-Connor, a 51-year-old physiotherapist and an army veteran, with the heinous crime of standing 50 meters from an abortion clinic and silently praying for three minutes."" He was found guilty of breaking the ""government's new buffer zones law"" and was sentenced to pay ""thousands of pounds in legal costs to the prosecution.""DW Fact check: Misleading.Adam Smith-Connor was convicted of breaching a safe zone by praying outside an abortion clinic in Bournemouth in November 2022, after refusing repeated requests to leave the area. He was handed a 100-pound fine which he didn't pay, triggering a court case. Ultimately, he was given a two-year conditional discharge and ordered to pay prosecution costs to the tune of 9,000 pounds ($11,300, €10,800).The Public Spaces Protection Order was introduced outside the Bournemouth clinic in October 2022 to create buffer zones around abortion clinics to stop women from being harassed or having to pass by vigils.The son Smith-Connor said he was praying for was aborted over 20 years ago.Smith-Connor is receiving legal support from an American conservative Christian legal advocacy group that has been labeled a ""hate group."" He has appealed the decision.Claim: ""I look to Brussels, where EU commissars warn citizens that they intend to shut down social media during times of civil unrest the moment they spot what they've judged to be, quote, 'hateful content,'"" Vance said in Munich.DW Fact check: Misleading.After quick research around JD Vance's claim on EU commissars warning about shutting down social media during times of civil unrest, we found different media reports referring to the topic back in July 2023. They cited former European Commissioner for Internal Market, Thierry Breton , referring to the possibility of a shutdown under EU's content moderation law only ""in extreme cases"" and following due process if they didn't crack down problematic content during riots. In his statements, Breton cites and refers to the Digital Services Act ( DSA ), adopted in 2022 and fully applicable since 2024.Breton's comments were a response to French President Emmanuel Macron raising the possibility of blocking social media platforms during civil unrest in the country after the police killing of 17-year-old Nahel Mezouk in a Paris suburb. Article 19, a British human rights organization, and other organizations raised concerns over Breton's comments.But does the DSA actually allow EU Member States to shut down social media during times of unrest like JD Vance claims?The DSA regulates online intermediaries and platforms, such as social networks, content-sharing platforms and app stores and addresses issues like illegal content, transparent advertising and disinformation. According to the European Commission, the main goal of the act is ""to prevent illegal and harmful activities online and the spread of disinformation.""In its fourth chapter, under Article 51, the DSA establishes the powers of the Digital Services Coordinator, the authority designated by an EU Member State to supervise providers of intermediary services and enforce their regulation.The act states in Article 51, Section 3b that if Digital Services Coordinators consider that an infringement that is causing serious harm and entails a criminal offense involving a threat to the life or safety of persons has not been remedied, they can request a competent judicial authority to order the temporary restriction of access of recipients to the service concerned by the infringement. If this is not technically feasible, the provider's online interface on which the infringement takes place can be restricted.This measure, however, is the last of a series of mechanisms against platforms that don't comply with the EU legal framework. That means that for this figure to be able to restrict the use of a social media platform, all other measures outlined in the DSA must have been exhausted, including allowing the management of the platform to adopt a plan of action to terminate the infringement (Section 3a of Article 51).And how does this affect social media platforms? The DSA dictates specific obligations to what it considers ""very large online platforms,"" meaning platforms and search engines reaching 45 million or more consumers in Europe. The list of these online platforms include services by providers like Google, Meta, TikTok, Twitter International Unlimited Company (X.com), among others.In that regard, the claim that the EU commissars can shut down social media if they spot what they've judged to be ""hateful content"" is misleading.",US Vice President JD Vance claimed European freedom of speech was in decline. Vance cited several instances where people weren't allowed to express themselves online or pray in public and at home.

"Senior EC member Gyanesh Kumar new CEC, Haryana chief secretary Vivek Joshi on panel",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/senior-ec-member-gyanesh-kumar-new-cec-haryana-chief-secretary-vivek-joshi-on-panel/articleshow/118338829.cms,"NEW DELHI: Gyanesh Kumar , election commissioner since March 2024, was on Monday appointed as chief election commissioner (CEC), maintaining the convention of the seniormost election commissioner being elevated to the top post. However, for the first time, this convention was adhered to with the approval of the selection committee comprising Prime Minister Narendra Modi, home minister Amit Shah and leader of the opposition in Lok sabha Rahul Gandhi. Vivek Joshi , a serving 1989 batch IAS officer currently posted as Haryana chief secretary, has been appointed as election commissioner, restoring the EC’s strength to a three-member body following the retirement of incumbent Rajiv Kumar . Joshi had earlier served as secretary, personnel in Govt of India, and as Registrar general of Indian and census commissioner of India. He, as RGI, was to conduct the census 2021 before it had to be postponed on account of the Covid outbreak in March 2020.Kumar, a retired 1988 batch IAS officer allocated to the Kerala cadre, has served in several key positions in his home cadre and at the centre. He retired in January last year as secretary of the ministry of cooperation. He was an additional secretary in charge of J&K division in the home ministry when Article 370 was nullified in the erstwhile state.Joshi, going purely by the seniority principle, will be CEC after Gyanesh Kumar retires on January 27, 2029 upon turning 65 years of age. Election commissioner Sukhbir Singh Sandhu’s tenure in Nirvachan sadan is due to end on July 6, 2028.Joshi, who is 58 years old, will have a tenure of 5 years until February 2030. This means that he will be CEC during the 2029 general election to the Lok sabha and also hold all the state/UT elections as election commissioner and CEC. His experience as RGI and Census commissioner is expected to come in handy during the delimitation exercise, which is to be based on the next census taken after 2026. The delimitation commission has the chief election commissioner or his nominee as an ex-officio member.LoP in Lok sabha Rahul Gandhi submitted a dissent note during the meeting of the selection committee here on Monday. He is said to have asked the government to wait until February 19, when the Supreme court is due to hear the petition challenging the current composition of the selection panel, before picking the next CEC. The demand was however declined.This is the first time since enactment of the CEC and Other ECs (Appointment, conditions of service and term of office) Act, 2023, that a CEC has been appointed by a collegium or selection committee. Both Kumar and Sandhu were appointed as election commissioners in March last year, by the selection committee as proposed by the law.The legislation followed the direction of the Supreme court to the government in March 2023 to set up a committee comprising the Prime Minister, Chief Justice of India and LoP in the Lok Sabha as members, until the Parliament enacted a law providing for a collegium process for appointment of the CEC and election commissioners.Until the SC ruling in March 2023, all appointments to the post of CEC and election commissioners were made by a simple executive order, with no say or role of the opposition. A regular law on appointment and terms of service of the three EC members was eventually enacted in December 2023, though it provides for a selection committee comprising the PM, a minister to be nominated by the PM, and LoP in Lok sabha.The Supreme Court, at the last hearing of the challenge against the composition of the selection committee, had declined to interfere with pending appointments in the CEC necessitated by the completion of incumbent Rajiv Kumar’s tenure. The matter is due to be heard next Wednesday.","Gyanesh Kumar, election commissioner since March 2024, was on Monday appointed as chief election commissioner (CEC) Vivek Joshi, a serving 1989 batch IAS officer currently posted as Haryana chief secretary, has been appointed as election commissioner, restoring the EC’s strength to a three-member body.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118338865,imgsize-794822,width-400,resizemode-4/118338865.jpg"

He also said China remained the foremost security threat and economic challenge.In an interview, Pitroda, who is head of Indian Overseas Congress, said, ""What is this threat from China? I think it has been blown out of proportion at times as the US has this habit of defining an enemy. Our attitude is that of confrontation from day one and that attitude creates enemies and that attitude creates some support. To assume that China is enemy from day one is not fair; not fair to China not fair to everyone.""""India should not look at China as an enemy country, rather it should respect its growth. Confrontational attitude creates enemies and we need to change that pattern. China is not our enemy... This attitude creates support in the country. It is time to increase our communication. It is time for us to collaborate, cooperate and co-create, and not have this command and control mindset,"" said Pitroda.The counter from BJP came fast. ""All these things make clear the agenda of harming India. The 'mohabbat ki dukan' of Congress is for anti-national forces, be it George Soros or China,"" BJP spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi said.Pitroda's comments are an insult to Indian military and the sacrifices made by its personnel, invoking the Galwan clash in which 20 army personnel laid down their lives while an unspecified number of Chinese soldiers died too, Trivedi said. He added that India wants good relations with every country, adding it will be, however, done by maintaining its prestige and security.Pitroda also said, ""Some nations will grow slowly; some will grow fast. The developed nations will grow faster but such countries will have an ageing population as well. On the other side, developing economies will take time to grow and will have dividend of the demography. It is always good for world leaders to meet each other and bond with each other. It is always good to have more and more foreign interactions.

Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift might make their red carpet debut at the Met Gala

Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift, who have been dating since summer 2023, may be making their red carpet debut this year. They could have attended major red carpet events like Swift's Eras Tour film premiere in Los Angeles in October 2023 and the Grammys and VMAs in 2023 and 2024, but decided against them due to scheduling or unknown reasons. With Swift's Eras Tour over and Kelce having a break before the next football season, this event might be the perfect opportunity for them to make their red carpet debut.Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift have been busy with social engagements and busy schedules since dating in 2023. Taylor's Eras Tour and Travis' role in helping the Kansas City Chiefs win three consecutive Super Bowls make them as busy as any celebrity couple.Both Swift and Kelce, who are off the road after a disappointing Super Bowl loss, are expected to attend the Met Gala red carpet on May 5. People Magazine reports that they will make headlines due to their fashion expertise and previous attendance at the event. Both Swift and Kelce are expected to make a statement at the event.“As part of their R&R time, it's thought the couple could finally make an official red carpet appearance together — with the Met Gala earmarked as their first potential event together,” the Mirror reported of Kelce and Swift. “So far Swift and Kelce, who began dating in 2023, have struggled to align their schedules to step out together at an event.”Taylor Swift and her boyfriend Kelce have decided to attend the Met Gala, a first for Swift, as she hasn't attended the event with any of her boyfriends since 2016.

Tom Brady’s Valentine: A Heartwarming Bond with His Daughter



Tom Brady may no longer be in a romantic relationship, but that didn’t stop him from celebrating Valentine’s Day with someone truly special—his daughter, Vivian. The legendary quarterback, who was once married to Brazilian supermodel Gisele Bündchen, has embraced fatherhood as his primary focus since his divorce. His heartwarming tribute to Vivian on social media captured the essence of their close bond, proving that love transcends romantic relationships.Tom Brady, who shares two children—Benjamin, 15, and Vivian, 12—with Bündchen, as well as a 17-year-old son, Jack, with actress Bridget Moynahan, has kept a relatively low profile when it comes to dating since his divorce in October 2022. Instead, his priority has been his children. This Valentine’s Day, he took to Instagram to express his affection for his daughter, calling her “My Forever Valentine” while sharing a skiing selfie.It was a touching reminder of the deep connection between a father and his child. As many fans noted, it was refreshing to see a public figure like Brady put family first, embracing the joys of fatherhood rather than rushing into a new relationship.Despite the end of their 13-year marriage, Brady and Bündchen have reportedly maintained an amicable co-parenting dynamic. The former couple has worked towards ensuring that their children feel supported and loved, even as they navigate life separately.While Brady has remained devoted to his children and his burgeoning career as a broadcaster, Bündchen has fully embraced a new chapter in her life. The supermodel, now in a relationship with jiu-jitsu instructor Joaquim Valente, recently welcomed their first child together. According to reports, the birth went smoothly, and Valente has been by her side “24/7,” embracing fatherhood with dedication.Back in December, he shared few photos of his daughter on his Instagram to honor Vivian on her 12th birthday.""Happy 12th birthday to my forever baby girl. Watching you grow and chase after your dreams are the proudest moments of my life,"" Brady sweetly wrote in his caption. ""Your love, compassion, and joy fill up every room that you’re in, and will always make your daddy smile. You light up my life!""For Bündchen, this isn’t just another milestone—it’s a chance to build a life on her own terms. While some rumors have suggested that her romance with Valente may have overlapped with the final days of her marriage to Brady, no concrete evidence has ever surfaced. What remains clear is that she has moved forward with confidence, prioritizing her happiness and growing family.Meanwhile, Brady has continued making strides in his post-NFL career. His first season as a broadcaster for Fox recently concluded, marking the beginning of his decade-long, $375 million contract with the network. Though speculation has swirled regarding whether he might step away from the booth due to his involvement as a minority owner of the Las Vegas Raiders, he has firmly denied any such plans. His commitment to both broadcasting and his business ventures suggests that he is fully invested in his future.Also Read: Hollywood Brown free agency rumors: Which contenders could secure the Chiefs' speedy playmaker?
