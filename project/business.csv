NEW DELHI: The Centre has tasked a high-powered committee with reviewing and restructuring Association of Indian Universities (AIU) to align its mandate with National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and the proposed reforms under the Higher Education Commission of India (HECI).The move comes amid efforts to streamline governance of higher education, enhance institutional autonomy, and establish a globally competitive ecosystem for Indian universities, reports Manash Gohain.The committee will submit its report within six months, during which AIU has been advised to maintain status quo.The committee, chaired by Anil Sahasrabudhe, head of National Educational Technology Forum, is expected to examine AIU's role in the evolving regulatory landscape and suggest how it can support universities as they transition to HECI's unified framework. Its members include V Kamakoti, director, IIT-Madras; Nageshwar Rao, former VC, IGNOU; Shashikala Wanjari, VC, NIEPA; S Vidhyasubramaniam, VC, Sastra; and Pankaj Mittal, secretary general, AIU.AIU, founded in 1925, has for long coordinated functioning of universities, evaluated foreign degrees, and promoted sports and cultural initiatives.However, with NE envisioning a single regulator for higher education through HECI, AIU's operational structure and functions are being reassessed.""The committee will examine operational issues and AIU's future role, including whether it should come under HECI,"" a member told TOI. ""AIU's robust institutional network could be leveraged for global engagement and recognition of qualifications under the new system.""The restructuring also follows University Grants Commission 's notification of the Recognition and Grant of Equivalence to Qualifications Obtained from Foreign Educational Institutions Regulations, 2025. The framework seeks to establish a standardised and transparent process for recognising foreign academic degrees in India, bolstering the government's ""Study in India"" initiative.","The move comes amid efforts to streamline governance of higher education.

NEW DELHI: Government should never be a hurdle and should always be a facilitator of growth, PM Narendra Modi said on Saturday while virtually distributing 51,000 appointment letters for central government jobs, with this over 10 lakh recruitment letters have been issued through Rozgar melas since October 2022.Addressing the new recruits, PM Modi said the world acknowledges that India has two limitless strengths, one in demography and the other in democracy, the largest youth population and the world's biggest democracy.""This power of youth is both the greatest asset and the strongest guarantee for Bharat's bright future. Our government is working day and night to turn this strength into a formula for prosperity.""Modi said every individual deserves the opportunity to move ahead and it's the responsibility of the government to extend a helping hand. ""And you, my friends, are young. I have great faith in you. I have high expectations from you. Wherever you're assigned, you must always put the citizens first. Helping them, easing their difficulties-that alone will push the nation forward rapidly.""Modi said besides giving permanent government jobs, his administration is also focusing on creating new employment opportunities in the private sector.Referring to the recent Cabinet decision on the Employment Linked Incentive (ELI) scheme, he said the government will provide Rs 15,000 to a youth getting their first job in the private sector, which means the first month's salary of such employees will be borne by the government.For this, Rs 1 lakh crore has been allocated, he said.Highlighting a recently released report of the International Labour Organisation (ILO), Modi said it found more than 90 crore citizens in India have been brought under the umbrella of welfare schemes over the last decade, which is essentially an expansion of social security. He also spoke about the achievement of nearly 25 crore people rising out of poverty by ""defeating poverty with their strength and courage"".The PM said global institutions like the World Bank are openly praising India for this achievement and it's now being ranked among the top countries in the world in terms of equality. ""This means inequality is decreasing rapidly, and we are moving toward greater equality. The world is now taking note of this transformation,"" he said.","PM Narendra Modi said government should never be a hurdle and should always be a facilitator of growth.

'FUEL CUT OFF': Air India Boeing 787 Crash TRUTH Out; PROBE Reveals 'ACTUAL CAUSE' | Details

Poll Considering the information provided, what do you believe should be the priority for aviation safety moving forward? Enforcing all safety recommendations, even if advisory Improving aircraft technology and fault detection systems

The question is, what was the microprocessor status on the AI B787 that crashed?





MUMBAI: Three seconds after Air India flight AI-171 lifted off Ahmedabad runway on June 12, the fuel to both engines of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner (VT-ANB) cut off. Within a time gap of one second, fuel to both engines was cut off. ""In the cockpit voice recording, one of the pilots is heard asking the other why he cut off the fuel supply. The other pilot responded that he did not do so.""SEE ALSO: The big question in Air India Crash: If pilots didn’t cut fuel, what caused both engines to shut down mid-air? Experts say 'cockpit conversation is alarming' This is the most crucial bit of information in the 15-page preliminary report into the fatal Air India accident that killed 270 people. India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) released the report to the public in the early hours of Saturday.The big questions are: If the pilots didn’t cut off the fuel, then how did the fuel supply to both engines cut off during the most crucial phase of flight? Was it a technical problem with the Boeing 787 Dreamliner? The only other logical possibility is one of the pilots cutting off the fuel supply and saying he didn’t.The investigation report veers towards aircraft issue. It refers to a 2018 bulletin issued by the US aviation regulator on fuel switch malfunction.The AAIB report says that Air India did not carry out the relevant inspection recommended in the bulletin as it was not mandatory.The final report into the accident which will be released by June 12, 2026 will likely give the answers and reveal the probable causes of the accident.The aircraft started rolling at 08:07:37 UTC. As per the EAFR (the digital flight data recorder) data, the aircraft crossed the take-off decision speed V1 and achieved 153 kts IAS at 08:08:33 UTC. This is the speed at which a take-off should be continued and should not be aborted for any reason.This is the sequence of events put down in the AAIB report.The Vr speed (155 kts) was achieved as per the EAFR at 08:08:35 UTC. The Vr speed is the speed at which the pilots pull back the control column to lift the nose and lift off the ground.The aircraft air/ground sensors transitioned to air mode, consistent with lift-off at 08:08:39 UTC. The aircraft achieved the maximum recorded airspeed of 180 Knots IAS at about 08:08:42 UTC, and immediately thereafter, the Engine 1 and Engine 2 fuel cut-off switches transitioned from RUN to CUTOFF position one after another with a time gap of 01 sec.The Engine N1 and N2 began to decrease from their take-off values as the fuel supply to the engines was cut off.""The CCTV footage obtained from the airport showed Ram Air Turbine (RAT) getting deployed during the initial climb immediately after lift-off (fig. 15).No significant bird activity is observed in the vicinity of the flight path. The aircraft started to lose altitude before crossing the airport perimeter wall,"" the report says.While the commander of the flight had over 15,000 hours of flying experience, including about 8,600 hours on the B787, the co-pilot had 3,400 hours of flying experience. The co-pilot was Pilot Flying (PF), and the PIC was Pilot Monitoring (PM) for the flight.The investigation has noted the relevance of US aviation regulator, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Special Airworthiness Information Bulletin (SAIB) No. NM-18-33, issued in December 2018. It highlighted reports from operators regarding potential disengagement of the fuel control switch locking feature in Boeing aircraft, including the B787-8 fitted with similar part numbers.Although the SAIB did not result in an Airworthiness Directive (AD) and was advisory in nature, it recommended inspection of the fuel control switch installations to ensure proper locking function.""As per the information from Air India, the suggested inspections were not carried out as the SAIB was advisory and not mandatory,"" the report said. Records indicate that VT-ANB underwent throttle control module replacements in 2019 and 2023, unrelated to fuel control switch faults, and no subsequent fuel control switch defects were documented after 2023, it added.""At this stage of the investigation, no definitive cause has been determined, and no immediate safety recommendations have been issued to B787-8 or GEnx-1B engine operators,"" it said, adding that the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) of India, supported by NTSB-USA, Boeing, GE, FAA, and other international stakeholders, continues a detailed investigation focused on engineering, human factors, and system interactions.TOI spoke to senior commanders and examiners, and they referred to another service bulletin issued jointly by FAA and GE (engine manufacturer) in 2021.Service Bulletin FAA-2021-0273-0013 Attachment 2 recommends the replacement of the ""MN4 microprocessor on ECU"" with respect to engine fuel and control. It states: ""This recommendation is to address a condition that may affect Flight Safety... Accumulated thermal cycles of the EEC with age causes the solder ball to fail.""What is the MN4 Microprocessor and what is the Engine ECU? ECU stands for Engine Control Unit, and it’s like the ""brain"" of the modern jet engine. It monitors crucial engine parameters such as temperature, pressure, and RPM. But most importantly in this context, it controls fuel flow, variable geometry components, starting, and other functions to ensure optimal performance, efficiency, and safety.The MN4 is an integrated microprocessor used inside the ECU. It handles critical processing tasks such as interpreting sensor data, executing engine control algorithms, sending signals to actuators such as fuel metering valves, and managing fault detection and communication with cockpit systems.Why did the FAA recommend replacement of the MN4 Microprocessor? ""Solder Ball Fatigue"" was the crucial issue. ""The microprocessor is mounted on a Ball Grid Array (BGA), which uses tiny solder balls to attach the chip to the circuit board. As the aircraft flies, the engine experiences high temperature swings, constant vibration, and thermal cycling (repeated heating/cooling during engine start/shutdown).Over time, this thermal cycling causes fatigue cracks in the solder balls, leading to intermittent electrical connections, loss of signal processing, and potential engine control faults,"" explained a senior commander. A failing microprocessor could disrupt fuel flow control, cause engine flame-out, prevent proper engine restart, and trigger dual engine shutdowns (a catastrophic scenario).Capt Amit Singh, an air safety expert said: ""The time line given in the report is not tallying, especially after take-off when the RAT is shown deployed in the image, which means both engines have already failed. It does not match with the engine failure timings given in the report.""What was happening in the ten seconds after the fuel cutoff switch was off. The report doesn't give information on the conversation in the cockpit.The two sentences from the CVR mentioned in the report about a pilot enquiring who cutoff the fuel also doesn't carry a timestamp.""Capt Sam Thomas, President of the Airline Pilots' Association of India (APAI), said: ""The conversation between the pilots enquiring who cut off the fuel control switch is alarming.""Another crucial issue is, why did the Emergency Locator Transmitter not work after the accident? It should emit signals if the force of impact is between 3.2 to 3.5 G; the impact of the accident would have been exponentially higher.He also raised a question about the composition of the investigating team. ""Who is the expert in this group? It is assumed that some B787 Dreamliner pilots have been... Why the secrecy? We know pilots in India, and none of them have been consulted. IAF pilots are not competent enough to investigate and understand modern aircraft operated by civilian airlines.""The AAIB said: ""The investigation team comprising Mr. Sanjay Kumar Singh as Investigator-in-Charge, Mr. Jasbir Singh Larhga as chief investigator and Mr. Vipin Venu Varakoth, Mr. Veeraragavan K, and Mr. Vaishnav Vijayakumar as Investigators. Experienced Pilots, Engineers, Aviation Medicine Specialist, Aviation Psychologist and Flight Recorder Specialists have been taken on board as Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) to assist the Investigation in the area of their domain expertise,"" the report said.","Fuel supply to both engines cut off shortly after takeoff. Pilots denied responsibility, raising questions about technical malfunction or deliberate action. The final report into the accident which will be released by June 12, 2026 will likely give the answers and reveal the probable causes of the accident.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122398376,imgsize-735071,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/122398376.jpg"

India-US trade deal:

'Closer': Donald Trump's Big Hint On India-US Trade Deal Amid High Tariff Slapped On Other Nations

India, US near trade deal. What happens next if New Delhi joins Trump’s shortlist?



United States is working toward an interim trade agreement with India that could reduce proposed tariffs to below 20%. This would give India a more favourable position compared to other countries in the region.Unlike many nations, India is not expected to receive a formal tariff hike notice this week, and the agreement may be announced through an official statement, Bloomberg reported, quoting sources.The proposed interim trade deal between the two nations would allow both the sides to continue negotiations, giving India time to address unresolved issues before a broader agreement expected later this year, the source added.The planned agreement is likely to set a baseline tariff of under 20%, down from the 26% initially proposed, with provisions to allow further adjustments as part of a final pact. However, the exact timeline for the interim deal remains uncertain.If finalised, India would likely join a select group of nations that have reached trade arrangements with the Trump administration. In contrast, several other countries were hit with surprise tariff hikes of up to 50% this week, ahead of the August 1 deadline.India is pushing for a more favourable deal than the one signed with Vietnam, which included 20% tariffs. Vietnam, caught off guard by the high rate, is now seeking a revision. So far, only the UK has officially signed trade deals with the Trump administration.Earlier on Thursday, Trump told NBC News that he is considering imposing blanket tariffs of 15% to 20% on most trading partners who haven't yet received specific rates.Currently, the baseline tariff for most US trade partners stands at 10%. For Asian countries, announced rates so far include 20% for Vietnam and the Philippines, and as high as 40% for Laos and Myanmar.Despite being among the earliest to initiate trade discussions this year, India-US relations have shown recent tensions.While Trump indicates an imminent agreement, he has also suggested additional tariffs regarding India's BRICS membership.An Indian negotiation team is expected to visit Washington soon to push forward trade talks. India has already made its final offer to the Trump administration and outlined its non-negotiable positions.The key sticking points remain, including the US demand for India to allow genetically modified (GM) crops, something New Delhi has firmly opposed, citing concerns for farmers. Other unresolved issues include non-tariff barriers in agriculture and regulatory challenges in the pharmaceutical sector.","India is not expected to receive a formal tariff hike notice this week, and the agreement may be announced through an official statement.

If you have dedicated time and effort to helping others, whether through volunteering, medical aid, education, or supporting charitable causes, the UAE now offers a clear opportunity for long-term residency.The UAE has long been known for its rapid development and forward-looking policies. Over the past year, its Golden Visa program, originally focused on investors and entrepreneurs, has expanded its coveted Golden Visa to embrace a different kind of capital: humanitarian service.Volunteers, aid workers, and philanthropists, often unsung, mobile, and working across borders, now have a place to call home, with security and status to match. This development reflects the country’s commitment to supporting those who serve communities and contribute to social development, providing them with greater stability and recognition.Launched in 2019, the Golden Visa is a long-term residency program designed to attract and retain global talent. Originally targeting property investors, business owners, and individuals with substantial capital, the visa has since evolved into one of the most inclusive and strategic residency schemes in the world.Today, the Golden Visa is available to over ten categories of individuals, including frontline health workers, scientists, engineers, artists, athletes, and now, humanitarian contributors and volunteers.The visa comes with a powerful suite of benefits that distinguish it from traditional permits in the region:This framework ensures stability, not only for entrepreneurs and investors, but for those whose work uplifts the vulnerable and underserved.The UAE’s expansion of the Golden Visa to the humanitarian sector is not symbolic, it’s systematic. This dedicated pathway recognizes the invaluable impact of volunteers, nonprofit workers, and humanitarian pioneers, and ensures that their presence in the country is secure and celebrated.The goal is clear: to integrate socially committed individuals into the UAE’s social fabric, where they can continue serving communities without the administrative friction of short-term visas or professional instability.By doing so, the UAE is not only acknowledging their contributions, it’s also amplifying them.According to the Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs and Port Security (ICP), the Golden Visa for humanitarian contributors has clearly defined eligibility criteria. Applicants considered ""pioneers"" in humanitarian fields must demonstrate significant involvement in recognized charitable, volunteer, or community-based work. You may be granted the full 10-year Golden Visa, if you fall under one of the following categories:This category of elite humanitarian efforts reflects the UAE’s philosophy that humanitarianism is not a hobby, it’s a lifelong vocation worthy of permanence and prestige.Unlike broad or vague interpretations, the UAE has clearly outlined the sectors it considers essential within the humanitarian landscape. These areas represent critical needs both locally and globally, and those contributing within them are eligible for Golden Visa consideration.These sectors are not only vital to global sustainability but also reflect the UAE’s own national priorities in development, aid, and long-term resilience.To ensure credibility and measurable impact, the UAE has identified a number of recognized humanitarian organizations whose volunteers may qualify for the Golden Visa. These institutions play a vital role in both domestic and international aid efforts, and affiliation with them significantly strengthens any application.For a complete directory, applicants are encouraged to refer to the Ministry of Community Development’s official list of accredited charitable organizations.Applying for the Humanitarian Visa or Golden Visa for Volunteers involves submitting proof of your involvement in recognized humanitarian or volunteer work, along with identification and endorsement documents from UAE-registered organizations. Applications are processed through official government portals such as the ICA or GDRFA, depending on the emirate.Applicants must pay processing fees, which generally range from AED 3,000($816.77) to AED 5,000($1,361.28), and undergo routine checks like medical and security clearances. Processing times typically take a few weeks.Renewals are required every 5 to 10 years, depending on the visa type, and visa holders must continue active humanitarian involvement and maintain good standing with relevant organizations and UAE laws to remain eligible.The UAE’s extension of long-term residency to humanitarian contributors aligns with its broader commitment to global humanitarian efforts. Over the past two decades, the country has become a leading donor of aid relative to its GDP, supporting disaster relief in regions like Turkey, Syria and addressing hunger through large-scale meal campaigns.The UAE has also developed key institutions such as Dubai Cares, Noor Dubai Foundation, and the International Humanitarian City, which play important roles in education, health, and aid logistics. Domestically, initiatives like the Volunteer Emirates platform encourage community engagement, reflecting the country’s belief that humanitarian work begins at home.",The UAE’s Golden Visa now covers humanitarian workers and volunteers.

NEW DELHI: As the month-long Pakistan presidency of the UN Security Council (UNSC) nears its business end, Islamabad is gearing up to organize an open debate on unresolved disputes around the world, looking to follow it up with a resolution urging member-states to use mechanisms available to them for pacific settlement of disputes.While the motive behind convening this signature event under the UN’s maintenance of international peace and security agenda is to highlight the Kashmir issue, it’s unlikely Pakistan will name J&K for fear of getting the resolution vetoed. UNSC resolutions need 9 votes to pass, including the concurrence of all 5 permanent members.Pakistan deputy PM and foreign minister Ishaq Dar will travel to New York to chair the event on July 22 that will likely be briefed by Secretary General Antonio Guterres too.According to the Security Council Report, Pakistan aims to adopt the resolution urging full use of all Chapter VI mechanisms for peaceful resolution of disputes between nations. Article 33 of the Chapter states that the parties to any dispute, the continuance of which is likely to endanger the maintenance of international peace and security, shall seek a solution by, among other things, mediation and arbitration.However, the same Article also says the parties can seek a solution through “other peaceful means of their own choice”. This is important for India as it helps underscore its position that this is exactly what it is trying to do through Simla and Lahore Declarations that stress bilateralism.“The generic resolution which will most likely be conceptual in nature will focus on general principles not specific issues to avoid any objections,” says Syed Akbaruddin, former Indian ambassador to the UN. Pakistan also knows that except China, all other permanent members continue to maintain that Kashmir is a bilateral issue.While underlining the Council’s role in maintaining peace and security, many member-states stress that any such attempt can’t undermine a State’s sovereignty or invoke settlement agreements without the consent of both parties. The open debate follows closed consultations called by Pakistan on May 5 to discuss India-Pakistan tensions after the Pahalgam terrorist attack.Pakistan will also convene another signature event under its presidency, hoping to strengthen cooperation between the UN and Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), the 57-member body that has repeatedly expressed support for Islamabad’s Kashmir agenda.The meeting will take place under the UN’s ‘Cooperation between the United Nations and regional and subregional organizations’ agenda item. Along with Pakistan, there are 4 other non-permanent member-states that are also in the OIC – Algeria, Somalia, Sierra Leone and Guyana. It will be difficult though to gloss over differences between the Council and OIC on key issues like Israel’s actions in Gaza and the OIC condemnation of the US strikes on Iran. India has repeatedly accused the OIC of allowing its agenda to be hijacked by Pakistan, while ignoring Islamabad’s support to cross-border terrorism, and any mention of the Kashmir issue at the meeting is likely to be met with a similar response from India.",Pakistan is gearing up to organize an open debate on unresolved disputes around the world.

MUMBAI: The preliminary report of Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) into the June 12 Air India flight 171 crash in Ahmedabad refers to a serviceability bulletin on the Boeing-787's fuel control switch which indicates a potential equipment malfunction, but deemed it was not an unsafe condition.The AAIB report mentioned that the fuel switches of engine one and two of the Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner aircraft were cut off within a gap of one second and later turned on before the crash.Capt Sam Thomas, president of the Airline Pilots' Association of India, said: ""The AAIB report refers to a serviceability bulletin concerning the fuel control switch gates, which indicates a potential equipment malfunction. The tone and direction of the investigation suggest a bias toward pilot error. ALPA categorically rejects this presumption and insists on a fair, fact-based inquiry.""What is the possible technical issue? The AAIB report refers to the 'Special Airworthiness Information Bulletin (SAIB) No. NM-18-33' issued by the US regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), in Dec 2018. The bulletin is about the potential disengagement of the fuel control switch locking feature. The bulletin was issued after reports came in from operators of Boeing 737s that the fuel control switches were installed with the locking feature disengaged.The said fuel control switch design, including the locking feature, is similar on various Boeing airplane models, including the B787, the aircraft that crashed.The FAA recommended: ""Inspect the locking feature of the fuel control switch to ensure its engagement. While the airplane is on the ground, check whether the fuel control switch can be moved between the two positions without lifting up the switch. If the switch can be moved without lifting it up, the locking feature has been disengaged and the switch should be replaced at the earliest opportunity.""The AAIB report said: ""The airworthiness concern was not considered an unsafe condition that would warrant an airworthiness directive (AD) by FAA. As per information from Air India, the suggested inspections were not carried out as the SAIB was advisory and not mandatory.""",Preliminary report of Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) into the June 12 Air India flight 171 crash in Ahmedabad refers to a serviceability bulletin on the Boeing-787's fuel control switch.

What the report answers

What triggered the dual engine flame-out?

Did the pilots attempt an engine restart?

Was fuel contamination a factor?

What did cockpit audio reveal?

Was the aircraft airworthy?

Were flight crew and procedures followed?

What still remains uncertain

Could the engine electronic control unit (ECU) be at fault?

Why wasn’t the landing gear retracted?

Why is there no cockpit video?

Could it have been an electrical glitch?

Was the Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT) operational?

Who is on the investigative panel?

When is the final report expected?

In its first official account of the June 12 crash that killed 260 people in Ahmedabad, the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) has released a 15-page preliminary report into Air India Flight 171. The Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner plunged into a medical college hostel moments after takeoff, becoming one of India’s worst aviation tragedies in decades and the first fatal crash of a Dreamliner globally.The report stops short of assigning blame but outlines a chilling sequence of events: both engine fuel control switches were inexplicably moved from ""RUN"" to ""CUTOFF"" within a second of each other, starving the aircraft’s engines of fuel. Cockpit voice recordings captured one pilot asking the other why he had shut off the fuel. The other denied doing so.Despite relighting both engines, only one recovered fully before the plane crashed just 32 seconds after becoming airborne. The switches were later found back in the ""RUN"" position. While mechanical failure, bird strike and fuel contamination have been ruled out, the mystery of how the switches were moved persists, prompting calls for further forensic analysis and voice identification.Roughly seven seconds after lift-off, both fuel switches were cut to CUTOFF in less than one second, depriving the engines of fuel and leading to a thrust loss. The Ram Air Turbine (RAT) swung into action to supply emergency power—which was captured on CCTV footage shortly thereafter.Yes. The Enhanced Airborne Flight Recorder (EAFR) shows that around 10 seconds after the cutoff, both switches were returned to RUN, and one engine began recovering. However, the altitude was insufficient for a full restoration of thrust before crashing.No. DGCA lab tests on samples from the refuelling bowsers and tanks found the fuel to be satisfactory.The CVR captured a pilot asking, “Why did you cut off?” with the response, “I did not do so,” but identities were not assigned to either speaker.Yes. All mandatory checks had been completed. However, an advisory issued by the FAA in 2018 concerning fuel switch locking mechanisms was not acted upon, as it was classified as non-mandatory. The VT-ANB underwent throttle control module replacements in 2019 and 2023, with no reported fuel switch defects since, TOI reported..Both pilots passed pre-flight breathalyser tests and were visible on CCTV pre-departure. The captain, Sumeet Sabharwal, had over 15,000 flying hours (8,600 on the 787), while First Officer Clive Kunder had 3,400 hours. Sabharwal was monitoring, Kunder was flying.TOI reports that veteran commanders referenced a 2021 joint FAA–GE Service Bulletin recommending replacement of the “MN4 microprocessor” on the engine’s ECU—citing solder-ball fatigue due to thermal cycling that might lead to electrical faults. A failure here could plausibly trigger unintended switch activation.The report notes the gear was still down. One theory is that the crew was preoccupied with engine failure procedures and had no opportunity to retract the gear. Audit transcripts make no mention of the “positive climb” or “gear up” call being made.Experts like Peter Goelz of the NTSB have lamented the lack of visual cockpit recording, which could definitively identify who moved the switches, BBC reported.Former AAIB investigator Capt Kishore Chinta, while speaking with BBC raised the question of whether the ECU or other systems could have electronically tripped the fuel switches—adding to suspicions of a microprocessor fault.Capt Amit Singh, told TOI that the ELT failed to emit a distress signal—despite impacts of 3.2 to 3.5 g ordinarily triggering it. He also questioned discrepancies in the RAT deployment timeline and the lack of cockpit conversation timestamps.TOI had also reported that Capt Sam Thomas of the Airline Pilots’ Association of India raised doubts about the expertise composition of the AAIB team. The AAIB has since confirmed the inclusion of subject-matter experts: pilots, engineers, aviation medicine specialists and flight-recording experts supporting the core investigation team.According to AAIB, the comprehensive report is due by 12 June 2026. Until then, no definitive cause has been declared, nor have safety directives been issued for 787-8 operators or GE’s GEnx-1B engines.","The Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau has released a 15-page preliminary report into Air India Flight 171.

'FUEL CUT OFF': Air India Boeing 787 Crash TRUTH Out; PROBE Reveals 'ACTUAL CAUSE' | Details

NEW DELHI: The Airline Pilots’ Association of India (ALPA) on Saturday raised concerns over the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau’s (AAIB) preliminary report on the Air India plane crash in Ahmedabad, saying the investigation seems to assume that the pilots were responsible for the accident.""The tone and direction of the investigation suggest a bias toward pilot error. We categorically reject this presumption and insist on a fair, fact-based inquiry,"" ALPA India president Sam Thomas said in a statement.The association also pointed to a ""lack of transparency"" in the process. ""Investigations continue to be shrouded in secrecy, undermining credibility and public trust. Qualified, experienced personnel—especially line pilots—are still not being included in the investigation team,"" the statement said.A preliminary report has found that the fuel supply to both engines of Air India flight AI171 was cut off within a second of each other, causing confusion in the cockpit and the airplane plummeting back to ground almost immediately after taking off.The 15-page report says that in the cockpit voice recording, one unidentified pilot asked the other why he had cut off the fuel, which the other denied.ALPA referred to a Wall Street Journal article published on July 10 that reported the crash may have involved the movement of the engine fuel control switches.The association questioned how such information was leaked to the media before the official release of the report. ""A July 10 article in The Wall Street Journal references inadvertent movement of the fuel control switches. ALPA-I questions how such sensitive investigative details were leaked to international media,"" the statement read.ALPA also criticised the AAIB for releasing documents without proper official identification. ""ALPA-I is concerned that the preliminary AAIB report has been shared with the media without any responsible official signature or attribution,"" it said.The association again requested to be allowed to participate in the investigation process. ""ALPA-I renews its request to be included, at the very least, as observers in the investigation process to ensure transparency and accountability.""On June 12, a London-bound Boeing 787 Dreamliner crashed shortly after takeoff from Ahmedabad airport, hitting a medical college hostel. The crash killed 241 of the 242 people onboard and 19 people on the ground, making it the deadliest aviation accident in a decade.According to a timeline in the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) report, both engine fuel control switches—which are used to shut down the engines—were moved to the cutoff position almost immediately after takeoff. The report did not mention how this happened or who was responsible.Soon after the fuel control switches moved from RUN to CUTOFF, one second apart, a Ram Air Turbine (RAT) pump was deployed to provide hydraulic power as both engines dropped below idle speed.About 10 seconds later, the fuel control switch for Engine 1 was moved back to RUN, followed by Engine 2 four seconds later. The pilots managed to relight both engines, but only Engine 1 regained power. Engine 2 did not build enough thrust to stop the plane’s descent.One of the pilots made a ""Mayday, Mayday, Mayday"" call, but before air traffic control could respond, the aircraft clipped some trees and crashed just outside the airport boundary into a hostel occupied by students.","The Airline Pilots’ Association of India (ALPA) on Saturday raised concerns over the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau’s (AAIB) preliminary report on the Air India plane crash in Ahmedabad.

CHENNAI: There's no age limit for learning - some senior citizens in Tamil Nadu seem to have discovered this mantra. Three people aged 68, 67 and 60, including two lawyers, have cleared NEET this year and applied for MBBS admissions in Tamil Nadu. But, their sudden passion for a tough and demanding branch of study like medicine has left TN officials in a fix.State selection committee officials said there are at least 25 people, above the age of 35 years, competing for UG medical and dental courses. There's no upper age limit to appear for NEET as NMC had removed the bar on age or number of attempts for the qualifying examination.""This year, there are many graduates and professionals aspiring for a medical or dental seat. This is the highest number of middle-age and older applicants we have seen since 2017,"" said an official.Some candidates have obtained enough marks that could secure them a seat under the 69% reservation category and permit them to study medicine at a subsidised cost at a government college or free of cost at a private college.All three senior citizens applied for admission under a special quota, where 7.5% of seats are reserved for students from government schools to pursue medicine in government or private colleges free of cost.While the older candidates have the qualifying marks, officials are seeing technical problems - in many cases, documents are not matching the requirements mentioned in the prospectus, an official said.The core debate among officials is whether this special quota should extend to all graduates, regardless of age.","Three people aged 68, 67 and 60, including two lawyers, have cleared NEET this year and applied for MBBS admissions in Tamil Nadu.

Judge seeks 'reasonable care' while invoking BNS' stringent Sec 152

PRAYAGRAJ: Allahabad high court has observed that merely expressing support for Pakistan without referencing any specific incident or mentioning India does not prima facie constitute an offence under Section 152 (act endangering sovereignty or unity and integrity of India) of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS).Allowing the bail plea of Riyaz, accused of pledging support to Pakistan in an Instagram post, Justice Arun Kumar Singh Deshwal said a perusal of record showed ""the applicant has not mentioned anything which shows disrespect towards our country"".""Merely posting a message to...show support for any country may create anger or disharmony among citizens of India"", and may be punishable under Sec 196 of BNS (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language etc), but ""definitively will not attract"" Sec 152, the HC said in its July 10 order.Sec 196 of BNS provides for up to seven years in jail, while an offence under Sec 152 is non-bailable and carries a life sentence or imprisonment up to seven years and fine. The judge called for exercising ""reasonable care"" while invoking Sec 152 of BNS, saying it was a new provision stipulating stringent punishment, which had no equivalence in IPC.""For attracting ingredients of Sec 152, there must be purpose by spoken or written words, signs, visible representations, electronic communication to promote secession, armed rebellion, subversive activities or encourages feeling of separating activities or endangers the sovereignty, unity and integrity of India,"" HC said.""Merely posting a message to show support for any country may create anger or disharmony among citizens of India"", and may be punishable under Sec 196 of BNS (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language etc), which provides for up to seven years jail, but ""definitively will not attract ingredients of Sec 152, BNS"", HC said in its order July 10.Justice Deshwal said spoken words or posts on social media are also covered under the right to freedom of speech and expression, and should not be narrowly interpreted, unless they are of such nature which threaten the country's sovereignty and integrity or encourages separatism.During the hearing, the applicant submitted through his counsel that his social media post did not lower the dignity and sovereignty of the country. Neither was India named, nor the Indian flag or any photo was posted which showed disrespect to the country, he argued. ""Merely supporting a country, even if that country is an enemy to India, does not attract the ingredients of BNS Sec 152,"" the applicant's counsel said.State opposed the bail plea, submitting that such posts encourages separatism.

The left engine failed several seconds after the right engine, indicating that fuel control switches were cut off one after the other. The AAIB report has a lot of ambiguity.”A senior Boeing commander, requesting anonymity, said: “The argument that since Boeing has not issued an advisory it indicates the pilot moved the fuel to the cut-off position is flawed. Lack of advisory does not confirm system safety. Several aircraft design flaws were acknowledged only after multiple incidents, history has shown.“We know how pilots were the first to be blamed after the Lion Air crash involving a Boeing 737 MAX aircraft in 2018.”",Pilots have expressed their concerns about the the AAIB report.

The report is ambiguous on what starved the engines.But it referred to a 2018 safety bulletin that instructed airlines to look out for a possible mechanical fault with the fuel control switches, which could cut off fuel supply to the engines.“In the cockpit voice recording, one of the pilots is heard asking the other why did he cut off (the fuel supply). The other pilot responded that he did not do so.” This is the most crucial information in the 15-page preliminary report released early Saturday by India’s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB). The June 12 AI-171 crash killed 270 people, including 19 on the ground.Aviation safety experts criticised the report for paraphrasing the pilots’ exchange.What stands out in the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau's preliminary report into the AI 171 air crash is that it points to a single-point failure or tampering with a critical flight system, the fuel supply cutoff switch.The possibility of inadvertent movement of fuel control switch from “run”’ to “cut off” position was ruled out. “The fuel control switch has a locking mechanism for added safety. You lift it up with three fingers and roll it up and into the slot to run fuel supply to the engine and, similarly, you lift it up, roll it down and then push it back into the slot to cut off fuel supply,” said Captain Manoj Hathi, former director (operations), Air India. The report does refer to a 2018 serviceability bulletin concerning fuel control switch gates which flagged disengagement of the locking mechanism.The final report into the accident, to be released on or before June 12, 2026, will likely give answers and reveal the probable cause of the crash.Most crashes are caused by a combination of several factors & multiple failures, such as the AI Express Calicut or Mangalore crash in 2020 & 2010, respectively. While the commander of AI-171 had 15,000 hours of flying experience, including 8,600 hours on the B787, the co-pilot had 3,400 hours of experience.The senior commanders TOI spoke to also referred to another service bulletin issued jointly by the FAA and GE (engine manufacturer) in 2021. Service Bulletin FAA-2021-0273-0013 recommends the replacement of the “MN4 microprocessor on ECU” with respect to engine fuel and control. “This recommendation is to address a condition that may affect flight safety,” it states.It involves the engine control unit (ECU), the “brain” of modern jet engine. An ECU monitors crucial engine parameters and controls fuel flow. MN4 is an integrated microprocessor used inside ECU. It handles critical processing tasks such as interpreting sensor data, executing engine control algorithms, sending signals to actuators such as fuel metering valves, and managing fault detection and communication with cockpit systems.The report said CCTV footage obtained from the airport showed the ram air turbine (RAT) being deployed during initial climb immediately after lift-off. “No significant bird activity is observed in vicinity of the flight path. The aircraft started to lose altitude before crossing the airport perimeter wall,” the report said. “At this stage of the probe, no definitive cause has been determined, and no immediate safety recommendations have been issued to B787-8 or GEnx-1B engine operators,” it stated.","Preliminary report into the Air India flight AI171 crash in Ahmedabad has revealed an unsettling detail.

NEW DELHI: Justice Surya Kant, who would be the next CJI, told the world community that India, with a robust mechanism for protection of human rights, is often targeted by countries with rigid immigration policies & a documented tendency to use excessive force for minor violations.Bringing back memories of cruel treatments meted out to immigrants and Indians by police of foreign countries, Justice Kant told a gathering of eminent lawyers and social scientists at Stockholm that ""India has historically demonstrated a strong commitment to human rights, rooted in its constitutional framework and heritage, long before these conversations gained global traction.""""To be candid, it is somewhat paradoxical when countries with some of the most rigid immigration policies - and a documented tendency to resort to excessive use of force, even in response to minor infractions - position themselves as foremost champions of human rights.

Supreme Court Asks EC to Consider Aadhaar, Ration, Voter ID for Bihar Voter Roll Revision

NEW DELHI: While Aadhaar was conceived as an identity proof, and not as proof of citizenship, allowing onboarding without real scrutiny, recent moves have meant that only verified adults can enrol for the unique ID. Besides, the Unique Identification Authority of India UIDAI ) is going to tap the online database for passport, ration cards, and birth and matriculation certificates in the future for enrolment of adults and also for updates to ensure that Aadhaar remains foolproof.While Section 9 of the Aadhaar Act states that it is not evidence of citizenship or domicile, the new tools are seeking to ensure only citizens get the unique number.Over the last 15 years, over 140 crore Aadhaars have been generated, including for those who have died, and there is near adult saturation. With infants also now getting Aadhaar soon after birth, govt has decided to tighten the norms for new adult registrations.To thwart attempts by illegal immigrants to get the unique ID based on forged or fake documents, for the last couple of years, the onus has been on states to verify credentials and that Aadhaar is only issued after rigorous checks through a state portal.In the past, there were concerns over illegal immigrants getting Aadhaar and then using it for other purposes, including other IDs.""It is going to be difficult for any illegal immigrant to now get Aadhaar,"" argued an official, indicating a shift from the relaxed, if existent at all, rules of enrolment.Sources said that even if illegal immigrants use Aadhaar to clear the SIR of electoral rolls, there is little possibility of new ones being able to use that as the launchpad for acquiring documents, and most crucially, citizenship.A new tool developed by UIDAI is also going to put a second layer of check for updates as well as enrolments by tapping into documents available online, such as driving licenses, PAN, MNREGS details, and going forward, things like electricity bill.

Mamata Banerjee Slams BJP as Over 300 Bengal Workers Jailed in Rajasthan for Speaking Bengali

NEW DELHI: Tata Group chairman N Chandrasekaran met West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee in Kolkata on Wednesday, signalling a possible reset in ties between the industrial group and the state.The meeting, the first between Mamata Banerjee and a Tata group chairman since Banerjee became chief minister, comes over 17 years after her agitation led to Tata motors pulling out its Nano project from Singur.In a post on X, the TMC said, ""Mamata Banerjje hosted Natarajan Chandrasekaran, Chairman of Tata Sons and the Tata Group, for a constructive dialogue on Bengal's industrial growth and emerging opportunities. The meeting reflected Bengal's commitment to fostering meaningful public-private partnerships that drive innovation, investment, and inclusive development.""Seventeen years ago, following a protest led by Banerjee against land acquisition for a Tata Motors facility in Singur, the company relocated the plant. At the time, the state was governed by CPM under the late Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.The opposition Trinamool Congress in West Bengal, led by Mamata Banerjee, had led widespread protests after the state government had rejected her demand to return 400 acres land to farmers.In a move that was termed ""sad"" by the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh Tata announced his exit plan. PM Modi, who was then chief minister of Gujarat, spotted an opportunity and slid into the industrialist's DMs with a 'welcome' text.""When Ratan Tata said in a press conference in Kolkata that they are leaving West Bengal, I sent him a short SMS saying 'welcome'.

A recent study published in Nature Medicine by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), a specialised agency of the World Health Organization (WHO), has issued a stark warning: the world is facing a significant surge in gastric cancer cases, with Asia—and particularly India—bearing the brunt. The study analysed people born between 2008 and 2017 and estimated that 15.6 million individuals globally from this generation are at risk of developing gastric cancer in their lifetime. Worryingly, almost two-thirds of these cases will occur in Asia, largely due to high population numbers and ongoing exposure to risk factors.The study highlights that India and China together could account for approximately 6.5 million new gastric cancer cases in the coming decades. This projection positions Asia as the global hotspot for the disease. The rise is largely driven by factors such as rapid population growth, increasing life expectancy, and a continued prevalence of key risk factors—many of which are still not adequately addressed through public health measures. These include poor sanitation, limited access to healthcare, and dietary habits that may increase stomach cancer risk.Experts say this could make gastric cancer one of India’s biggest future health crises if timely action is not taken.One of the most important takeaways from the study is that Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is the leading cause of future gastric cancer cases—accounting for about 76% of them. This bacterium infects the lining of the stomach and can remain undetected for years. Over time, it causes inflammation that can lead to ulcers and eventually cancer. In India, where access to preventive screening is limited and awareness is low, H. pylori often goes untreated, significantly raising the risk of long-term health complications. The study urges stronger surveillance and early intervention programmes to tackle this hidden epidemic.Currently, gastric cancer is the fifth most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide, but its burden is not evenly distributed. While some regions, like Sub-Saharan Africa, report relatively low incidence rates today, the study warns of a six-fold increase in cases in those areas over time. In contrast, India’s numbers are expected to rise more sharply and sooner due to existing health inequalities, limited diagnostic infrastructure, and lack of widespread awareness about early symptoms. This puts millions of Indians at a heightened and preventable risk.The research points to a clear solution: early screening and treatment of H. pylori can dramatically reduce future cases of gastric cancer—by as much as 75%. In countries like India, where healthcare resources may be stretched, focusing on population-wide, low-cost screening initiatives could be a game-changer. Treating H. pylori with antibiotics and simple follow-up care could save countless lives and significantly ease the burden on the healthcare system. These preventive steps are not only scientifically sound but also financially viable.Perhaps the most alarming finding from the study is that gastric cancer is increasingly affecting younger individuals, especially those born after 2008. This is a major shift from previous decades when the disease primarily affected older adults.Combined with India’s ageing population, this trend could create a dual burden of both young and elderly patients requiring long-term cancer care. Without timely intervention, India risks reversing years of public health progress in cancer control.India must take public health action against gastric cancerTo reduce its future gastric cancer burden, India needs to adopt a multi-pronged public health strategy. The study recommends:These actions are essential not only to control gastric cancer rates but also to build long-term resilience in India’s public health system.With projections estimating over 1.6 million new gastric cancer cases in India alone, the country is at a crossroads. The study’s findings are a powerful reminder that prevention is not just possible—it is necessary. Investing in screening, early detection, and health education can prevent hundreds of thousands of deaths and reduce the financial and emotional toll on families. If India acts now, it can turn the tide and prevent gastric cancer from becoming an unstoppable epidemic in the decades to come.",Gastric cancer is rising in India faster than in many regions.

In a bold and aggressive move to dominate the artificial intelligence race, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is assembling a dream team for the company’s new Superintelligence Lab . The tech giant has reportedly offered record-breaking salary packages ranging from Rs 800 crore to over Rs 1,600 crore to lure top minds from Apple, OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic. The initiative aims to unify Meta’s fragmented AI projects and leap ahead in the race toward superintelligence, an even more ambitious goal than artificial general intelligence (AGI). With key hires and strategic leadership, Meta is now at the center of Silicon Valley’s escalating AI talent war .Meta’s recruitment spree signals a paradigm shift in the global AI race. As Zuckerberg pours billions into building a centralised AI superteam, rivals like OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic will face intensified pressure to retain talent and accelerate innovation. Whether Meta’s Superintelligence Lab will achieve its lofty goals remains to be seen but the talent war has clearly entered an explosive new chapter.Among the standout deals is Apple’s Ruoming Pang, who reportedly joined Meta for a staggering compensation package of $200 million (over Rs 1,600 crore). Similarly, OpenAI’s Trapit Bansal was offered $100 million (approximately Rs 800 crore). According to Bloomberg, these packages include base salary, substantial signing bonuses, and large equity grants with performance-linked clauses and extended vesting schedules, ensuring long-term loyalty. These deals make Meta’s AI salaries among the highest in the corporate world even surpassing many CEO compensation packages at global banks.Meta’s Superintelligence Lab (MSL) is being built to rival OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic in the development of next-gen AI. Zuckerberg has made it clear: AI is the company’s top priority, and he’s willing to pay big to bring the best minds on board. The effort includes unifying Meta’s various AI teams under a central umbrella focused on creating “superintelligence,” a loosely defined concept that goes beyond AGI by outperforming the human brain itself.Meta’s Superintelligence Lab is being led by some of the most high-profile figures in AI and tech:Unlike artificial general intelligence (AGI), which aims to mimic human cognitive functions, superintelligence refers to AI systems that far exceed human intelligence in all domains. While still theoretical, it is seen as the ultimate frontier in AI, capable of solving complex problems across medicine, science, economy, and creativity. By investing in top-tier AI talent and consolidating its resources, Meta aims to leapfrog competitors and become a global leader in the development of superintelligent systems.The massive salary deals are not simple cash payouts. Instead, they typically include:Industry insiders say this is only the beginning. Meta is reportedly in talks with several more prominent figures in AI research and robotics, indicating further expansions to the Superintelligence Lab.

Goldman Sachs to the halls of power: Rishi Sunak’s journey from finance to political leadership



Leading the UK through crisis

A return to finance, but with a new mission

The full circle of a modern career





Former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak ’s latest career move surprised many. After serving as the United Kingdom’s Prime Minister during one of its most turbulent periods, he is now returning to Goldman Sachs as a senior adviser. This is the very firm where his professional journey in finance began more than two decades ago.“Right now, our country is facing a profound economic crisis. The aftermath of COVID still lingers. Putin’s war in Ukraine has destabilized energy markets and supply chains over the world.”I pledge to govern with integrity, professionalism, and accountability, and promise, “Trust is earned, and I will earn yours.”Said Rishi Sunak, as he took oath as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom on 25 October 2022, under looming clouds of uncertainty, and water as well, outside 10 Downing Street, London.Now, two and a half years later, Rishi Sunak prepares to return to the private sector as a senior adviser at Goldman Sachs, the very firm where his journey in finance began.From a young investment banker at Goldman, to leading the UK through political and economic turbulence, and now rejoining the financial world, Sunak’s path has come full circle, blending boardrooms, ballots, and comeback at Goldman Sachs.Rishi Sunak’s early career was rooted firmly in finance.After graduating from Oxford and Stanford, he joined Goldman Sachs as a summer intern and then worked as an analyst from 2001 to 2004. This experience gave him a foundation in global markets and investment banking, skills that would later shape his approach to economic policy. However, Sunak’s ambitions extended beyond finance. He entered politics, winning the Richmond parliamentary seat in 2015. His rise was rapid, culminating in his appointment as Chancellor of the Exchequer, where he managed the UK’s economic response to the COVID-19 crisis. His leadership during this period was widely noted for balancing fiscal support with a commitment to economic stability.Rishi Sunak became Prime Minister in October 2022 following the resignation of Liz Truss, whose short-lived premiership collapsed under the weight of economic turmoil triggered by her government’s mini-budget. As the Conservative Party scrambled to restore stability, Sunak was chosen as a unifying candidate and became the party leader unopposed.W hen Sunak became Prime Minister, the UK was grappling with a profound economic crisis. The pandemic’s aftershocks still reverberated through public health and the economy, while war in Ukraine had disrupted energy supplies and global trade. Sunak’s government faced soaring inflation, energy price shocks, and political instability. His promise to govern with integrity and accountability was tested daily. Despite the challenges, he sought to restore confidence both at home and abroad, emphasizing fiscal responsibility and international cooperation.Despite efforts to stabilize markets and promote fiscal responsibility, Sunak struggled to unite a deeply fractured Conservative Party. Mounting internal tensions, declining public support, and a series of backbench rebellions eventually eroded his authority. In July 2024, facing mounting pressure and a leadership challenge, Sunak announced his resignation as Conservative Party leader, bringing his tenure as Prime Minister to an end.Rishi Sunak’s return to Goldman Sachs as a senior adviser is notable not only because it marks a return to his roots but also because of the role’s unique nature. He will advise clients on macroeconomic and geopolitical issues, drawing on his extensive experience in government and global affairs. Importantly, Sunak will not receive a salary for this position. Instead, any earnings will be donated to the Richmond Project, a charity he co-founded to promote numeracy and education in his constituency. This arrangement reflects a commitment to public service even as he re-engages with the private sector.Rishi Sunak’s comeback to the private sector is not just a career move; it’s an inspiring example of how public service can continue even after leaving office. Unlike many politicians who often retire into comfort, relying on accumulated wealth or government benefits, Sunak is choosing to re-engage professionally in a meaningful way. His decision to take on an advisory role at Goldman Sachs without drawing a salary, and instead donating any earnings to charity, reflects both integrity and a deep sense of responsibility. It sets a strong precedent for how former leaders can remain active contributors to society, not for personal gain, but for a greater public good.Rishi Sunak’s journey embodies a rare blend of high finance and high politics. Few have navigated the worlds of global banking and national leadership with such prominence. His career trajectory, from a young banker in New York to the UK’s highest political office, and now back to the financial sector, illustrates the increasingly interconnected nature of finance and governance in the 21st century. As he steps into this advisory role, Sunak brings a wealth of experience shaped by crises and leadership, poised to influence global economic discussions from a new vantage point.In a world where the lines between public service and private enterprise often blur, Sunak’s return to Goldman Sachs is a vivid example of how careers can evolve in unexpected ways, reflecting both personal ambition and a broader narrative of resilience and adaptability.","Former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is returning to Goldman Sachs as a senior adviser. This is the very firm where his professional journey in finance began more than two decades ago. Sunak will advise clients on macroeconomic and geopolitical issues, drawing on his extensive experience in government and global affairs.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122344635,imgsize-21572,width-400,resizemode-4/122344635.jpg"

HYDERABAD: A 44-year-old businessman from Gandhinagar lost 3.24 crore to fraudsters posing as stock trading advisors of a private company.Based on the complaint of the victim, a case was registered by the Telangana State Cyber Security Bureau (TGCSB) on Friday.On May 28, the businessman received a message from an unknown number inviting him to a WhatsApp group run by fraudsters posing as 'Prisha Singh' and 'Purav Jhaveri'. For six weeks, the duo posted market tips, block-trade charts, and invitations to participate in upcoming initial public offerings, claiming privileged access to the institutional quota for high net-worth clients.The victim fell for the tricks and downloaded a trading application shared through a private link. He began wiring money for assured IPO allotments.He transferred 3.24 crore from three personal accounts to 20 beneficiary accounts held in various banks between May 30 and July 9. The fraudsters allowed a single withdrawal of 5 lakh on June 20 to bolster credibility, a TGCSB official said.Till that withdrawal, the victim had only transferred about 75 lakh. After the withdrawal, he transferred 1.49 crore more till July 4, taking the total investment to 2.24 crore.""On 8 July, the amount shown in my app was 30 crore, and I attempted to liquidate it.

NEW DELHI: In Pune, Jamaluddin bought over 2 lakh square feet of land for Rs 16 crore through complex agreements that included multiple stakeholders — among them, family members of court staff from the Chief Judicial Magistrate’s office.The deals, investigators say, were just one part of a sprawling operation involving illegal religious conversions and questionable real estate acquisitions across two states.On Saturday, UP’s Anti-Terrorism Squad arrested the 70-year-old — known in Balrampur as Hazrat Baba Jamaluddin ‘Peer Baba’ — along with his wife Nasreen, for allegedly orchestrating a religious conversion network and acquiring property worth over Rs 100 crore using forged or dubious means.In Balrampur alone, the couple is believed to have purchased land worth Rs 1.5 crore and developed it into residential and commercial structures without securing legal land-use conversion.Police say they lived near the Chand Auliya Dargah, where Jamaluddin presented himself as a Sufi spiritual leader and built a loyal following.But Jamaluddin was not always a religious figure.“He posed as a spiritual guide but was running a well-structured conversion racket,” said ADG (Law and Order) Amitabh Yash.“People were converted through emotional exploitation, pressure or allurements. We are now uncovering financial and property links as well.”Several FIRs have been lodged against the couple, and authorities suspect a wider network.The ATS is now scrutinising all land deals, especially in Pune, where the names of judicial staff families on agreement papers have raised concern. More arrests are likely as the investigation deepens.","Police say they lived near the Chand Auliya Dargah, where Jamaluddin presented himself as a Sufi spiritual leader and built a loyal following.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's net worth soars $1 billion as the chipmaker joins the $4 trillion club,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huangs-net-worth-soars-1-billion-as-the-chipmaker-joins-the-4-trillion-club/articleshow/122377958.cms,"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang

Jensen Huang’s net worth passes $140 billion



Nvidia’s market value climbs above $4 trillion



How a 3.5 percent stake fuels one of the world’s biggest fortunes



Where Jensen Huang now ranks among global billionaires



Why investors keep bidding the price up

AI demand everywhere. Cloud providers, carmakers, and sovereign data-centre projects line up for the current Hopper chips and the coming Blackwell series.

Scarcity premium. Nvidia controls around 80 percent of high-end AI GPU supply, and capacity stays tight even after Taiwan’s fabs ramp up output.

Ecosystem lock-in. CUDA software and support contracts make switching costs high, so even rivals that launch competitive silicon must still lure developers away.

What could slow the rally

Export curbs. The United States still blocks top-tier chips from shipping to China, Nvidia’s largest single-country market outside the U.S.

New competition. AMD, Intel and a clutch of start-ups are readying chips that nibble at Nvidia’s margins, especially in inference workloads.

Rich valuation. At about 40 times forward earnings, the stock leaves little room for an earnings miss; even a small disappointment could yank billions from Huang’s paper wealth.

Nvidia finished trading on July 10 with a market value of just over $4 trillion, the first time any listed firm has crossed that threshold. The jump did more than rewrite Wall Street leaderboards; it also pushed co-founder and Chief Executive Jensen Huang’s fortune past $140 billion. He owns about 3.5 percent of Nvidia, held directly and through family trusts, so every flicker in the share price lands straight in his pocket.Bloomberg’s daily billionaire tally shows Jensen Huang adding roughly $1 billion in a single session, and nearly $28 billion in 2025 so far. That kind of lift puts him shoulder-to-shoulder with household names like Warren Buffett, a spot unthinkable just three years ago. Investors keep paying the premium because Nvidia sells the chips that make modern AI run, from data-centre clusters to enterprise servers. The faster the market grows, the richer Huang becomes.As of the New York closing bell on 10 July, Bloomberg pegged Huang’s net worth at $143 billion, up from about $20 billion in early 2022. That leap happened in stages: $44 billion by mid-2023, $117 billion in late 2024, and now the $140-plus range. Fueled by the AI boom and soaring Nvidia shares, the difference this year alone is bigger than the entire market value of some Fortune 500 firms.The company’s share price settled near $164, capping a run that has lifted the stock 74 percent since April’s low and around 22 percent since January. Nvidia is now the dominant weight in the S&P 500, ahead of Apple and Microsoft. Analysts at Citi, Barclays and Loop Capital all raised their price targets this week, citing demand for the upcoming Blackwell platform and a backlog of data-centre orders.Huang’s percentage looks small beside founder holdings at some other tech giants, yet at a $4 trillion valuation it leaves him with shares worth roughly $140 billion. The stake figure comes from Nvidia’s March 2025 proxy filing and excludes unvested stock units. Cash, past dividend income and secondary-share sales round out the number Bloomberg uses, but the equity slice is what matters daily.With the latest move, he edges into Bloomberg’s global top ten, swapping places with Google’s Larry Page and closing in on Warren Buffett. Forbes, which refreshes less often, lists him ninth. None of the other names in that bracket made their money so fast in so short a window.","N Nvidia finished trading on July 10 with a market value of just over $4 trillion, the first time any listed firm has crossed that threshold.

Goldman Sachs hires a new employee that could be a 'nightmare' for engineering graduates,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/goldman-sachs-hires-a-new-employee-that-could-be-a-nightmare-for-engineering-graduates/articleshow/122414587.cms,"AI workforce could transform banking productivity



Entry-level positions face uncertain future

Goldman Sachs has made a hiring decision that could send shockwaves through the engineering job market : the investment banking giant is deploying Devin , an AI software engineer that never sleeps, never takes breaks, and never asks for a raise. The bank announced it will initially deploy hundreds of these autonomous coders, with plans to scale to thousands.The AI employee, developed by London-based startup Cognition, represents a seismic shift in how major financial institutions approach software development. Goldman's Chief Information Officer Marco Argenti told CNBC that Devin will function ""like our new employee who's going to start doing stuff on the behalf of our developers.""With Goldman employing 12,000 human developers, the introduction of thousands of AI coders signals a fundamental transformation in the industry's labor dynamics. Argenti projects that Devin could boost productivity by three to four times compared to previous AI tools, focusing on routine tasks like updating legacy code that human engineers often consider drudgery.""Those models are basically just as good as any developer, it's really cool,"" Argenti told CNBC, describing the AI's capabilities as matching human performance levels.The implications for aspiring engineers are particularly concerning. Bloomberg Intelligence warned in January that banks could eliminate up to 200,000 jobs globally over the next three to five years due to AI adoption. Traditional analyst positions—the typical entry point for finance careers—may shrink dramatically as routine coding and research tasks become increasingly automated.However, Argenti envisions a ""hybrid workforce"" where humans and AI work collaboratively. ""It's really about people and AIs working side by side,"" he explained to CNBC. ""Engineers are going to be expected to have the ability to really describe problems in a coherent way and turn it into prompts.""While roles requiring sector expertise, client relationships, and high-stakes judgment are expected to remain resilient, the era of AI coders has officially begun on Wall Street.","Goldman Sachs is deploying an AI software engineer that never sleeps, never takes breaks, and never asks for a raise.

Fentanyl to fix trade and toxins



US President Donald Trump has sent letters to 23 trading partners this week, including Canada, Japan, Brazil, and others — threatening blanket import tariffs ranging from 20% to 50%. The move, part of a renewed aggressive trade stance, also includes a 50% duty on copper imports.The letters outline that the proposed 30% general tariff would be in addition to existing levies — such as 50% on steel and aluminum and 25% on autos, which will remain in place. Countries have until August 1 to negotiate individual trade deals to avoid the hikes.This marks a return to Trump’s hardline approach seen earlier this year, when a similar round of tariff announcements jolted global markets before being postponed.Earlier on Saturday, Trump warned he would impose a 30% tariff on imports from the European Union and Mexico starting August 1, after trade talks with both sides failed to reach a full agreement.The announcement, shared through letters posted on Trump’s Truth Social account, marks a sharp escalation in trade tensions. It has alarmed US allies and shaken investor confidence.Despite global pushback, Trump appears undeterred, buoyed by a strong US economy and record stock market highs.In his letter to the European Commission, Trump demanded that the EU remove all tariffs on US goods, claiming the bloc must help reduce America’s trade deficit.Both the EU and Mexico, key US trade partners, condemned the proposed tariffs as unfair and disruptive. Despite the warning, they expressed willingness to continue negotiations in hopes of reaching a broader deal before the deadline.Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said she remained confident that an agreement could still be finalised. ""I've always said that in these cases, what you have to do is keep a cool head to face any problem,"" Sheinbaum said.""We're also clear on what we can work with the United States government on, and we're clear on what we can't. And there's something that's never negotiable: the sovereignty of our country,"" she added.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that, ""The European Union will allow complete, open Market Access to the United States, with no Tariff being charged to us, in an attempt to reduce the large Trade Deficit,"" he wrote.She also warned that the 30% tariffs ""would disrupt essential transatlantic supply chains, to the detriment of businesses, consumers and patients on both sides of the Atlantic.""Trump has so far only reached framework trade deals with a few countries like the UK, China, and Vietnam. Talks with other major partners remain ongoing.The proposed tariff rate for Mexico is less than Canada's 35%, with both nations' correspondence mentioning fentanyl trafficking, despite official statistics indicating substantially higher seizures at the Mexican frontier compared to the Canadian border, according to Reuters.""Mexico has been helping me secure the border, BUT, what Mexico has done, is not enough. Mexico still has not stopped the Cartels who are trying to turn all of North America into a Narco-Trafficking Playground,"" Trump wrote.China remains the primary supplier of precursor chemicals for fentanyl production.According to US authorities, just 0.2% of all fentanyl seized in the country comes through the Canadian border, with the overwhelming majority smuggled in from Mexico via the southern border.Mexico, which sends over 80% of its exports to the US , became America’s top trading partner in 2023, largely driven by free trade between the two nations.Meanwhile, the European Union had initially aimed for a full-scale trade deal with the US but has since dialed back its ambitions. It is now pursuing a more flexible framework agreement, similar to the one struck with the UK, leaving finer details to be worked out over time.The EU faces internal tensions as Germany advocates for swift agreement to protect its industrial interests, whilst other members, including France, advise against accepting unfavourable US terms.Bernd Lange, who leads the European Parliament's trade committee, advised Brussels to implement counter-measures immediately. ""This is a slap in the face for the negotiations. This is no way to deal with a key trading partner,"" Lange told Reuters.Trump's recent tariff directives have generated substantial revenue, with US customs duties exceeding $100 billion in the fiscal year through to June, according to US Treasury figures. These measures have affected diplomatic relations with close US allies.","US President Donald Trump has sent letters to 23 trading partners this week, threatening blanket import tariffs ranging from 20% to 50%. The move, part of a renewed aggressive trade stance, also includes a 50% duty on copper imports. Countries have until August 1 to negotiate individual trade deals to avoid the hikes.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122414575,imgsize-29030,width-400,resizemode-4/122414575.jpg"
US customs duties top $100bn for first time in a financial year,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-customs-duties-top-100bn-for-first-time-in-a-financial-year/articleshow/122414436.cms,"US customs duties top $100bn for first time in a financial year





US customs duty collections surged again in June as President Donald Trump’s tariffs gained steam, topping $100 billion for the first time during a fiscal year and helping to produce a surprise $27 billion budget surplus for the month, the treasury department reported on Friday.The budget data showed that tariffs are starting to build into a significant revenue contributor for the federal govt, with customs duties in June hitting new records, quadrupling to $27.2 billion on a gross basis and $26.6 billion on a net basis after refunds.The budget results are likely to reinforce Trump’s view of tariffs as a lucrative revenue source and as a hammer to enforce non-trade foreign policy. He said on Tuesday that “the big money” would start to flow in after he imposes higher “reciprocal” tariffs on US trading partners on Aug 1.US treasury secretary Scott Bessent said on X that the results show the US “reaping the rewards” from Trump’s tariff agenda. “As President Trump works hard to take back our nation’s economic sovereignty, today’s Monthly Treasury Statement is demonstrating record customs duties – and with no inflation!” Bessent said.For the first nine months of fiscal 2025, the customs take reached records of $113.3 billion on a gross basis and $108 billion on a net basis, nearly double the prior-year collections.The govt’s fiscal year ends on Sept 30.In the space of roughly four months, tariffs as a share of federal revenue have more than doubled to around 5% from about 2% historically.The June budget surplus represented a turnaround from the $71 billion deficit in June 2024. The new tariff-related revenue helped boost total budget receipts last month by 13%, or $60 billion, to $526 billion, a record for that month, the Treasury said. Outlays in June fell 7%, or $38 billion, to $499 billion.The overall year-to-date deficit, however, increased 5%, or $64 billion, to $1.337 trillion, as outlays rose for health care programs, Social Security retirement benefits, defence spending, debt interest and the department of homeland security, the Treasury said.REUTERS","US customs duties in June hit new records, quadrupling to $27.2 billion on a gross basis and $26.6 billion after refunds.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.
