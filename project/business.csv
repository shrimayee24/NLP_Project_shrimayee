"In motor accidents, claims not restricted to third party, says SC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-motor-accidents-claims-not-restricted-to-third-party-says-sc/articleshow/123105796.cms,"New Delhi: Motor vehicle insurance protects a policyholder against claims made by a third party for damages due to the policyholder's actions, but what about the claim against injury/death of the policyholder themselves in a road accident? Holding that family members of such a policyholder can also claim compensation, Supreme Court has referred the issue to a larger bench since there are contradictory verdicts of the apex court on the matter.While hearing the compensation plea of a minor girl who lost both her parents in a car accident in which her father was on the driving seat, a bench of Justices Sudhanshu Dhulia and K Vinod Chandran said section 163A of the Motor Vehicles Act could be invoked for such a claim, as it is a special provision which overrides not only all the provisions of the Act but also any other law in force for the time being.In this case, the minor was awarded compensation by the insurance company for the death of her mother but not for her father as he was himself the insured party.The bench said: ""... a claim under section 163A, as per the words employed in the provision, according to us covers every claim and is not restricted to a third party claim; without any requirement of establishing the negligence, if death or permanent disability is caused by reason of the motor accident. This would also take in the liability with respect to the death of an owner or a driver who stepped into the shoes of the owner, if the claim is made under section 163A dehors the statutory liability under section 147 or the contractual liability as reduced to writing in an insurance policy"".The insurance company, however, took the stand that the petitioner, having succeeded to the estate of the owner of the vehicle who died in the accident cannot at the same time be the person who has the liability and is the recipient of the compensation.""It would override the provisions under sections 147 & 149 along with the other provisions of the Act and the law regulating insurance as also the terms of the policy confining the claim with respect to an owner-driver to a fixed sum. This according to us is the intention of incorporating the non-obstante clause under Section 163A providing for no-fault liability claims, the compensation for which is restricted to the structured formula under the IInd Schedule. It is a beneficial piece of legislation brought in, keeping in mind the enhanced chances of an accident, resulting from the prevalence of vehicles in the overcrowded roads of today. It was a social security scheme, brought about considering the need for a more comprehensive scheme of 'no-fault' liability for reasons of the ever-increasing instances of motor vehicle accidents and the difficulty in proving rash and negligent driving,"" the bench said.",The Supreme Court has referred the issue to a larger bench since there are contradictory verdicts of the apex court on the matter. A bench of Justices Sudhanshu Dhulia and K Vinod Chandran said section 163A of the Motor Vehicles Act could be invoked for such a claim.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123105808,imgsize-10596,width-400,resizemode-4/123105808.jpg"
SC proposes panel to manage Banke Bihari temple till HC decides on UP ordinance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-proposes-panel-to-manage-banke-bihari-temple-till-hc-decides-on-up-ordinance/articleshow/123105718.cms,".

New Delhi: Supreme Court on Monday proposed an interim committee, headed by a retired high court judge and comprising the district collector and Goswamis (pujaris), for management of Banke Bihari temple in Vrindavan till Allahabad HC decides the validity of UP govt's ordinance for all-round development of the temple area to provide facilities to pilgrims.A bench of justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi asked additional solicitor general K M Nataraj to seek state govt's response by Tuesday morning, when it will take up a batch of petitions that have questioned the manner in which state govt, prompted by an SC order, had come out with a temple development project proposed to be implemented at a cost of Rs 500 crore.The Goswamis, through senior advocate Shyam Divan, said taking over of the temple through an ordinance was extraordinary as the issue was not before constitutional courts, which were only dealing with alleged mismanagement of Guriraj temple. In the guise of better management of temples in the 'Braj area', the SC passed an order without even hearing temple Goswamis, which prompted the state to issue the ordinance, they said.The bench agreed that such an order without hearing the Goswamis could not have been passed. However, the Justice Kant-led bench said, ""It is only for development of the temple and its surroundings. The state's intention does not appear to siphon out temple funds but to spend it on providing facilities to pilgrims.""Divan said Banke Bihari temple was a private temple and any law brought about by govt or any order passed by courts could not have been without hearing the Goswamis, who have been managing it for centuries.The bench saw a point in Divan's argument and said, ""The state cannot be seen coming to the court in a clandestine manner and getting an order set aside in a case which had nothing to do with Banke Bihari temple. We will set aside that part of the order, set up an interim committee to manage the temple and permit the HC to decide the legality of the ordinance.""However, the bench was in favour of development around the temple to provide space for parking and places to stay for pilgrims with all facilities. ""Religious tourism is assuming great importance. It can also be a big revenue earner and help in job creation. But there has to be adequate facilities to handle pilgrims,"" it said.The interim committee may also have to induct representatives of Archaeological Survey of India as well as independent architects proficient in ancient building restoration to protect the temple, the bench said.",Supreme Court proposes an interim committee for management of Banke Bihari temple in Vrindavan.

Shifting of the home ministry and personnel department from North Block at Raisina Hills to the new address gains huge significance since these have operated from the iconic structure for nearly 90 years.In the next couple of months, the finance ministry will shift from North Block to another Kartavya Bhawan, and at a later stage, offices of the defence ministry and PMO will also move out from South Block to pave way for Yuge Yugeen Bharat museum.Govt has proposed building 10 new Kartavya Bhawans along Kartavya Path as part of the Central Vista revamp programme. Two of these buildings are expected to be completed by next month, which will pave way for shifting of more ministries and departments to these new office complexes.In a statement, PMO said Kartavya Bhawan was a state-of-the-art office complex spanning an area of around 1.5 lakh sq metres across two basements and seven storeys, including the ground floor.The building is designed to use 30% less energy. Solar panels on the roof of Kartavya Bhavan-3 will generate over 5.3 lakh units of electricity every year, and charging stations for electric vehicles are also provided, it said.The new facility will reduce repair and maintenance costs, boost productivity, improve employee well-being and enhance overall service delivery, govt said. It added the building would exemplify modern governance infrastructure featuring IT-ready and secure workspac-es, ID card-based access, integrated surveillance and a centralised command system. These will also promote eco-consciousness.","Kartavya Bhawan-3 will house the home, petroleum and natural gas, external affairs and rural development ministries.

He holds about 12% of Tesla, the electric car pioneer valued at hundreds of billions, and owns a 42% stake in SpaceX, a leader in commercial space technology.Musk’s 2022 purchase of Twitter (renamed X) for $44 billion further solidified his influence in social media and AI-driven communication. Known for his ambitious projects, such as Neuralink and The Boring Company, Musk’s vision revolves around sustainable energy, interplanetary travel, and integrating AI into human life.Larry Ellison, co-founder of Oracle Corporation, built one of the most successful software companies in the world, specializing in databases and enterprise solutions.

Recently, he married Lauren Sánchez, marking a new personal chapter. Bezos also focuses on philanthropy, investing in climate change initiatives and education. His success story is a prime example of how innovation and risk-taking can create unprecedented wealth.Mark Zuckerberg launched Facebook in 2004, a social media platform that became an integral part of global communication.

His leadership and strategic direction have positioned Nvidia as one of the most valuable tech companies, crucial to the growth of AI and cloud computing industries.Bernard Arnault, chairman of LVMH (Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton), oversees more than 70 luxury brands, including Louis Vuitton, Dior, and Sephora.

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Monday reiterated the need for a fair and multipolar global order, stating, “Our collective desire is to see a fair and representative global order, not one dominated by a few. ”His remarks come amid global trade tensions, including US tariff threats and pressure on India’s oil trade with Russia.Speaking at the BIMSTEC Traditional Music Festival in Delhi titled SaptaSur: Seven Nations, One Melody, Jaishankar linked cultural traditions to the broader vision of global balance. “We live in complicated and uncertain times. Our collective desire is to see a fair and representative global order, not one dominated by a few. That quest is often articulated as political or economic rebalancing,” he said.Jaishankar noted that cultural traditions play a role in strengthening identity and guiding national direction. “Traditions are of particular value because ultimately they define identity. We must be assured about what we are if we want to be confident about shaping the future. For nations like us, traditions are truly a great source of strength,” he added.Referring to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s earlier commitments, Jaishankar said, “I also want to underline what Director General of ICCR has said, that this was a commitment which was made by Prime Minister Modi at the BIMSTEC Summit and I am so glad that like so many of his commitments, that has been kept and kept early.”He also reflected on his personal journey and how cultural exposure shaped his outlook. “In my own case, it was actually through music and to some extent books that I developed an interest in the world. There is so much that music is able to convey that it is understandably regarded as the soul of a society,” he said.“Music serves both as a bridge between nations and a powerful expression of their heritage and identity,” he concluded.Jaishankar’s remarks come as India faces economic and diplomatic challenges, including concerns over possible US tariffs and warnings related to India’s ongoing oil trade with Russia.While the minister did not refer directly to these developments, his emphasis on sovereignty, tradition, and multipolarity echoed India’s current diplomatic positioning."," External affairs minister S Jaishankar spoke at the BIMSTEC Traditional Music Festival in Delhi.

The lower deck is 1,449.3 metres long and helps vehicles move from Patna College to Gandhi Maidan, near BN College. Both decks, each 8.5 metres wide, connect to PMCH and are meant to reduce traffic jams in the city.Officials said Ashok Rajpath will soon have four levels—two flyover tiers, a ground-level service road, and the upcoming metro underground.","The structure was built at a cost of Rs 422 crore.

‘What was the tearing hurry?’: SC questions UP govt on Banke Bihari ordinance; may put corridor nod on hold,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/what-was-the-tearing-hurry-sc-questions-up-govt-on-banke-bihari-ordinance-may-put-corridor-nod-on-hold/articleshow/123095831.cms,"Poll Do you agree with the Supreme Court's decision to question the Uttar Pradesh government's management of the Shri Banke Bihari temple? Yes, I support the Supreme Court's intervention. No, the government should manage it.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday questioned the Uttar Pradesh government's move to take over the management of the Shri Banke Bihari temple in Vrindavan, stating that key stakeholders had not been heard before the May 15 order allowing the corridor project was passed.A bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi questioned the state’s decision-making, particularly the urgency with which it enacted the Uttar Pradesh Shri Bankey Bihari Ji Temple Trust Ordinance, 2025. “What stopped you from acquiring the entire land and properties from your corpus in public interest? What was the tearing hurry in enacting the ordinance, when the matter was sub-judice? Providing basic amenities and developing the area is the duty of the state. There are numerous instances where the state’s participation has helped in developing the religious places like in Golden Temple in Amritsar,” the bench observed.The court said it would pass orders on August 5 to put the May 15 direction in abeyance and appoint a retired high court or district judge to oversee daily management of the temple. The proposed committee would also include other stakeholders and focus on managing the temple and surrounding areas.The bench expressed concern about the state approaching the court without informing key parties. “Less said the better. How do you justify the directions passed by the court? The state in the most unfortunate way came to the court in the most clandestine manner without informing the court receiver or stakeholders... Get the directions behind their back and set aside the order of the high court. This is the least thing we expect from the state,” the bench said.At present, the court is not examining the constitutionality of the ordinance. That issue will be taken up by the Allahabad High Court. The top court will instead look into interim arrangements for managing the temple and adjacent developments.“This is the land of Lord Krishna. He was the first mediator known to the world. Let’s find a way out to resolve the dispute pending for years and develop the area in the interest of lakhs of devotees who visit these iconic religious places. Basic amenities need to be created as nowadays religious tourism is one of the biggest sources of revenue,” the bench added.During the hearing, Additional Solicitor General K M Nataraj, representing the state, said a member of the Goswami community had approached the court but was not supported by others. The bench questioned why all warring factions were not heard and asked whether the court receiver in charge of temple management had been consulted.The court also questioned the state’s use of temple funds for acquiring five acres of land for a holding area. It asked why public funds were not used instead and again raised concern about the urgency of the ordinance when the matter was already under judicial consideration.Senior advocate Shyam Divan, appearing for the temple’s managing committee, said the order had been passed without giving them an opportunity to be heard. He said since it was a private temple, notice to them was necessary.The court responded by stating that the term “private temple” was not applicable in this context, given the scale of public involvement and the number of devotees who visit annually.The top court asked Nataraj to seek instructions from the state and adjourned the matter to August 5. It clarified that the High Court would examine the legality of the ordinance and that the Supreme Court would adjust its May 15 directions accordingly.Petitioners, including members of the managing committee, have been asked to submit suggestions on how the temple affairs should be managed during the interim period.The plea, filed through advocate Tanvi Dubey on behalf of the temple's management committee, challenges the ordinance which hands over control of the temple to a state-administered trust.On May 15, the Supreme Court had allowed the Uttar Pradesh government’s impleadment application and permitted the development of a temple corridor at Vrindavan, using temple funds. That order may now be placed on hold pending further directions.(With inputs form agencies)",The Supreme Court on Monday questioned the Uttar Pradesh government's move to take over the management of the Shri Banke Bihari temple in Vrindavan.

Telangana car owners may not benefit from Centre’s Annual Toll Pass scheme,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/telangana-car-owners-may-not-benefit-from-centres-annual-toll-pass-scheme/articleshow/123079938.cms,"File photo

NEW DELHI: Private car owners in Telangana won’t be able to avail the Annual Toll Pass scheme for National Highways (NHs) and expressways to be launched by the Centre on Aug 15, as vehicles registered in the state have not yet been migrated to the Vahan database (central registry of vehicles). The annual pass, to be issued from next week, requires real-time validation of vehicle class through the Vahan portal.Union transport secretary V Umashankar, in a letter addressed to Telangana chief secretary last week, sought the “personal intervention” of the top state official to expedite the migration of the state’s vehicle data to Vahan portal and ensure “equitable access to the nationwide facility for road users”.In his letter, Umashankar highlighted how the Centre had reached out to the state govt in May this year for merger of state registers for driving licence (DL) and registration certificate (RC) of vehicles with the national registers —Sarathi and Vahan -- but the same has not happened yet.Except Telangana, all other states have come on board, officials said. They expect the state to act quickly, as the issue is crucial for dealing with DL and RC related matters at the national level.Umashankar has said that only vehicles registered as “non-commercial car/ jeep/ van” are eligible to get the FASTag-based pass by paying Rs 3,000, granting them 200 toll-free crossings on NHs in a year.Sources said the National Highways Authority of India is giving finishing touches to the scheme and putting all infrastructure in place for starting the registration process. A special team has been trained to handle queries relating to the scheme at their call centre.","The annual pass, to be issued from next week, requires real-time validation of vehicle class through the Vahan portal.

"Govt says National Medical Commission rules allow complaints against docs, but commission rejects them",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-says-national-medical-commission-rules-allow-complaints-against-docs-but-commission-rejects-them/articleshow/123076303.cms,"NEW DELHI: Responding to a Parliament question on whether the National Medical Commission (NMC) was biased towards doctors, the health ministry has stated that the ethics regulation of 2002 provided for complaints against doctors. However, NMC’s ethics section has been rejecting all patient appeals claiming that the NMC Act prevails over the 2002 ethics regulation.The NMC act states that doctors can file appeals against state medical council decisions. Referring to this, the ethics section has been dismissing all appeals filed by patients claiming that only doctors can file an appeal, even though it is against the law.The NMC Act itself clearly states that “the rules and regulations made under the Indian Medical Council Act, 1956, shall continue to be in force and operate till new standards or requirements are specified under this Act or the rules and regulations made thereunder”.Since the Indian Medical Council (Professional Conduct, Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations, 2002 has not been replaced, it still stands. Clause 8.8 of the 2002 ethics regulation states: “Any person aggrieved by the decision of the State Medical Council on any complaint against a delinquent physician, shall have the right to file an appeal to the MCI within a period of 60 days from the date of receipt of the order passed by the said Medical Council”.Yet, over 162 appeals of patients have been rejected by the NMC.In the reply to Parliament, minister of state for health Anupriya Patel stated that “to ensure that the NMC functions in a transparent and fair manner”, the central government appoints the chairperson and presidents of four autonomous boards as per the NMC Act 2019. However, there is no transparency as even the minutes of the meetings of the NMC and its autonomous boards are not available in the public domain as used to be the case with the erstwhile Medical Council of India. Moreover, all autonomous boards including the posts of presidents are currently almost entirely vacant with the government having failed to make appointments for over 10 months.The few minutes of commission’s meetings accessed using RTI show that most non-doctor ex-officio members hardly ever attend meetings and hence most decisions are taken by commission members, almost most of whom are doctors. Of the 33-member commission, about 20 are doctors.“I have complained to the health ministry and the law ministry by registered post about NMC rejecting patient appeals and hence I have proof. So, the health ministry cannot claim to have not received any complaints,” said Gokul Aneja, husband of a victim of alleged medical negligence, who appealed against the decision of the Punjab state medical council, only to have his appeal rejected twice.","The NMC act states that doctors can file appeals against state medical council decisions.

"To drive sale of EVs, government to clarify they are exempt from 15-year 'end of life' norm",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/to-drive-sale-of-evs-government-to-clarify-they-are-exempt-from-15-year-end-of-life-norm/articleshow/123082925.cms,".

NEW DELHI: In a bid to increase the penetration of electric buses, cars and trucks, and to spur their sales, government is likely to clarify soon that the 15-year 'End of Life' (EoL) regulation isn't applicable to EVs.The power ministry will also expedite extending the CAFE norms (regulations designed to reduce fuel consumption and CO2 emissions) to urban freight vehicles, trucks and buses.These were among the steps finalised at a recent high-level meeting chaired by Niti Aayog member Rajiv Gauba amid concerns over the slow progress of EV penetration in the country, which was barely 7.6% in 2024, as against the target of 30% by 2030. While EV penetration is higher for two- and three-wheelers and buses, it has been slow for four-wheelers, with e-trucks not having taken off so far.Sources said that responding to an observation from road transport secretary V Umashankar that most over 15-year-old buses are privately owned, Niti Aayog CEO BVR Subrahmanyam suggested that if the 15-year EOL regulation is not applied to EVs, it may spur sales.Umashankar also held that a mandate for EV adoption works best at places where a certain level of penetration and ecosystem are in place.Sources said there was a consensus to move from incentives to mandates and disincentives for faster EV adoption and for strategies to have saturation in five cities for buses, para-transit and urban freight vehicles. A source said there was unanimous agreement on the need for fast expansion of charging infrastructure, deployment of fast chargers, development of new battery technologies to reduce import dependence and easier finance for e-buses and e-trucks.Days later, the finance ministry held talks with banks to address their reluctance to finance EVs and the issue of higher interest rates.At the meeting chaired by financial services secretary M Nagaraju, banks urged govt to standardise batteries, bring down vehicle costs and announce some incentive for purchase of new batteries, considering that batteries usually have to be replaced in 6-7 years and account for 40-50% of the cost of EVs.","Government is likely to clarify soon that the 15-year 'End of Life' regulation isn't applicable to EVs.

NEW DELHI: Disappointing former Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel and his son, Supreme Court on Monday asked them to move high court to challenge Enforcement Directorate 's allegedly illegal practice of filing incomplete chargesheets in money laundering cases to keep the probe open-ended, and keep them apprehensive about their possible arrest at any time.Baghel said since 2019, there had been six ECIRs filed by ED under PMLA relating to Nagrik Apurti Nigam (PDS), income tax, District Mineral Fund, coal levy, Mahadev betting and Chhattisgarh liquor cases. In all these cases, there was a constant threat of his arrest, he said.Appearing for him and his son, senior advocates A M Singhvi and Mukul Rohatgi told a bench of justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi that filing of multiple incomplete chargesheets, on the specious ground that the probe was ongoing, was illegal since it was mandatory for ED to take permission of the magistrate to carry out further investigation.The bench said, ""This abnormality of rushing directly to Supreme Court is becoming chronic, especially when cases involve affluent and influential people. If you are seeking quashing of the FIRs or chargesheets on grounds of irregularity on part of the agency, then you must move the HC."" Singhvi and Rohatgi withdrew their petitions.In another petition by Baghel, senior advocate Kapil Sibal told the bench that the former CM was challenging the constitutional validity of PMLA sections 50 and 63. ""The framework u/s 50(2) and 50(3) of PMLA infringes upon the fundamental rights against self incrimination guaranteed under Article 20(3)... The aforesaid provisions permit ED to summon any person and compel answers and production of documents under a threat of penalty u/s 63 of the Act and arrest under Section 19 of the Act,"" Sibal said.Appearing for ED, additional solicitor general S V Raju said these petitions were not maintainable as the former CM had not been named in any of the ECIRs.","Baghel said since 2019, there had been six ECIRs filed by ED under PMLA relating to Nagrik Apurti Nigam (PDS), income tax, District Mineral Fund, coal levy and Mahadev betting.

"Boards ignore SC order, says no to disabled who cleared NEET",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/boards-ignore-sc-order-says-no-to-disabled-who-cleared-neet/articleshow/123104625.cms,"Several candidates with disabilities who cleared the NEET exam in 2025 have been rejected by many of the 16 medical boards across India as being ineligible to do MBBS due to their disability. The candidates complained that the boards seem to be unaware or poorly trained in the new interim guidelines on ""functional assessment"" of persons with disabilities issued on July 19. With no appellate body being constituted by the National Medical Commission (NMC) or the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS), as directed by the Supreme Court, the candidates are left with no forum for redress other than courts.According to the National Testing Agency, 753 of the 8,842 candidates with disabilities who sat for the NEET exam have cleared it. The interim guidelines state that legal and policy developments collectively emphasise the prioritisation of ""functional competency over rigid percentage-based disability thresholds"". They talk about facilitating reasonable accommodations, revisiting eligibility norms and adopting evaluation criteria focused on individual capabilities.Yet, according to a wheelchair-using candidate who was rejected, the board asked the person to perform seven physical activities including walking, standing and climbing stairs. Another candidate with missing fingers was rejected by a board in Tamil Nadu but went to Kerala for counselling for the All-India quota and was selected.The NMC has failed to identify at least one assessment centre in each state though the apex court order in Oct last year stated that ""the availability of medical boards should be increased so that there is minimum one medical board in each state and union territory for proper medical examination of students who have passed the examination"". With just 16 centres in 11 states, candidates are forced to spend considerable amounts on travelling, food and lodging.""There appears to be very poor sensitisation in the boards on how to deal with candidates with disabilities. A board in Chennai referred to the candidate as ""patient"" while rejecting her saying that she is ""wheelchair bound"". How will they select when they see her as a patient?"" said Dr Satendra Singh, founder of Doctors With Disabilities: Agents of Change, India's largest network of health professionals with disabilities.This is despite the Supreme Court order stating: ""To enable members of the Disability Assessment Boards to effectively apply the functional competency test, they must be adequately trained by professionals and persons with disabilities or those who have worked on disability justice"". It further mandated that each disability assessment board include at least one doctor with a disability.Although counselling commenced on 21 July 2025, no training schedule for members of the disability assessment boards has been published and no directive has been issued mandating the inclusion of a doctor with a disability on the boards.""The NMC had agreed in court to change the name of the boards from Disability Assessment Boards to Ability Assessment Boards to reflect the change in the focus of the assessments, but that term is nowhere there in the interim guidelines. Candidates with disabilities are paying the price and not everyone can afford to go to court,"" said Dr Singh, who has written to the NMC and the DGHS.He added that the interim guidelines were inadequate, though NMC's expert committee had taken nine months to frame them in time for the 2025-26 academic year.","Candidates with disabilities who cleared the NEET exam in 2025 have been rejected by many of the 16 medical boards across India.

'Unreasonable': India hits back at Trump tirade on Russian oil,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/unreasonable-india-hits-back-at-trump-tirade-on-russian-oil/articleshow/123104332.cms,"External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar (ANI file photo)

MEA: Nations slamming India themselves trading with Russia

In its first direct public pushback against US President Donald Trump's repeated targeting of India over trade with Russia, the Centre termed his criticism ""unjustified and unreasonable"". It said like any major economy, New Delhi will take all necessary measures to safeguard its national interests and economic security.In an official statement, ministry of external affairs said the US itself continues to import uranium hexafluoride for its nuclear industry, palladium for its EV industry and fertilisers as well as chemicals from Russia.The response, a rare outpouring of frustration with Trump's rants, followed another outburst by the US president in which he accused India of buying massive amounts of Russian Oil and selling it in the open market for big profits, while threatening to substantially raise tariffs on imports from India.MEA added that India's imports are meant to ensure predictable and affordable energy costs to Indian consumers and are a necessity compelled by global market situation. ""...It is revealing that the very nations criticising India are...indulging in trade with Russia. Unlike our case, such trade is not even a vital national compulsion,"" said spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal.It is revealing that the very nations criticising India are themselves indulging in trade with Russia.Unlike our case, such trade is not even a vital national compulsion,” said MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal.The official also recalled that the US had in 2022 encouraged Indian imports from Russia as it helped stabilise the global energy market.Trump’s blunt and open threat, which came on top of the 25% tariffs and unquantified penalty he has already announced last week, did not specify if there would be more or higher tariffs than he has already rolled out. But what seems certain is that he is angered by India’s obduracy in not concluding a trade deal on his terms and its insistence on continuing to buy discounted Russian oil.In a message he posted on his “Truth Social” platform, Trump also accused India of not caring “how many people in Ukraine are being killed by the Russian War Machine”. Trump surrogates have alleged that India and China are virtually bankrolling the war because they are among the world’s top two oil importers, and revenue from hydrocarbons is what is funding the Russian military.The charge that New Delhi is re-selling Russian oil for profit appears to be a distortion, twisting India’s large refining capacity that makes Russian oil suitable for export, including to Europe.Trump is also irked by India’s repudiation of his repeated claim that he used the bait of trade to stop the India-Pakistan war, a claim he has made nearly 30 times in several fora. Unable to end the Russia-Ukraine war on “Day One” of his presidency as he had pledged, Trump is talking up his claimed role in the India-Pakistan cessation of hostilities in a transparent bid for a Nobel Prize, including gratuitously canvassing for it with anyone who listens.The extraordinary threat by the US president, who has weaponised tariffs for a range of objectives from gouging trade deals from poor and vulnerable nations to trying to bring about regime change (like in Brazil) to dismantling groups like Brics, which he sees as a threat to the US and the primacy of its currency, is unprecedented in history.Combined with Trump’s sudden love for Pakistan, ostensibly for its glib backing for a Nobel Prize for him, it evokes among some commentators memories of Washington’s infamous 1970’s “tilt” during the Nixon administration, when the US tried to bully New Delhi during the Bangladesh Liberation War by sending the US Seventh Fleet to the Bay of Bengal with the nuclear-powered USS Enterprise.While a much weaker India refused to be browbeaten by the Nixon-Kissinger threat at that time, New Delhi appears to be in as defiant a mood in the face of Trump’s belligerence, potentially risking what some experts have said could be a 2% blow to its GDP growth (currently clocking around 6.5%), but which some govt surrogates say could be as low as 0.2%.“India has been targeted by the US and the European Union for importing oil from Russia after the commencement of the Ukraine conflict. In fact, India began importing from Russia because traditional supplies were diverted to Europe after the outbreak of the conflict. The United States at that time actively encouraged such imports by India for strengthening global energy markets stability,” said MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal.Such reactions by India were limited earlier to calls by the Europeans to shun trade with Russia. The ministry also said that the EU in 2024 had a bilateral trade of Euro 67.5 billion in goods with Russia. In addition, it had trade in services estimated at Euro 17.2 billion in 2023. This, added the official, is significantly more than India’s total trade with Russia that year or subsequently.“European imports of LNG in 2024, in fact, reached a record 16.5m tonnes, surpassing the last record of 15.2m tonnes in 2022,” Jaiswal said, adding that Europe-Russia trade includes not just energy, but also fertilizers, mining products, chemicals, iron and steel and machinery and transport equipment.","Nations slamming India themselves trading with Russia, says MEA.

‘Op Akhal’ Enters Day 3; One Terrorist Killed in Joint Operation in Kulgam

NEW DELHI: Army Chief General Upendra Dwivedi on Monday said the Indian armed forces are fully prepared to handle fifth-generation warfare marked by non-contact combat, strategic tempo and psychological dominance, emphasising that the nature of modern warfare demands integration of conventional power with emerging technologies.Speaking at the Indian Institute of Technology-Madras, Gen Dwivedi described future battlefields as ones “where boots must share space with bots.”He was addressing a session on ‘ Operation Sindoor – A New Chapter in India’s Fight Against Terrorism’, and used the occasion to highlight India’s evolving military doctrine and readiness.Describing Operation Sindoor as a turning point, Gen Dwivedi said it was an “intelligence-driven response that redefined India’s counter-terrorism doctrine.”As per news agency PTI, he stated that the 88-hour tri-services operation was “unprecedented in scale, range, depth and strategic impact,” compelling Pakistan to seek a ceasefire within that window. He said it was executed across the DIME spectrum, referring to diplomatic, informational, military and economic efforts.During his two-day visit to Chennai, the army chief also inaugurated ‘Agnishodh’, a dedicated Indian Army Research Cell at IIT-Madras to promote indigenous defence innovations.As per a press release, this initiative forms part of the Army’s ‘Five Pillars of Transformation’, particularly focusing on modernisation and technology infusion.Gen Dwivedi underscored the military’s commitment to self-reliance through collaborations under national technology missions like ‘INDIAai’, ‘Chip-to-Startup’, and ‘Project QuILA’, with Military College of Telecommunication Engineering (MCTE), Mhow, as a strategic partner.According to PTI, he also appreciated innovation-led efforts of Indian Army cells at institutions such as IIT-Delhi, IIT-Kanpur and IISc-Bengaluru. He noted that programmes like Project SAMBHAV and additive manufacturing partnerships with Army Base Workshops are “setting new benchmarks” in applied defence technology.Calling the IIT-Madras collaboration a landmark step, he said ‘Agnishodh’ would convert academic excellence into battlefield innovation and bolster the goal of ‘Viksit Bharat by 2047’.During the event, the Army Chief also honoured four decorated ex-servicemen with Veteran Achievers Awards, recognising their service and continued contributions to nation-building, the official statement added.","Army Chief General Upendra Dwivedi said the Indian armed forces are fully prepared to handle fifth-generation warfare.

So, the construction period reduces significantly,” said an official.The Central Public Works Department (CPWD) has implemented the project at an expenditure of around Rs 550 crore. The buildings have a shelf life of over 100 years. The two-level basement has the capacity to accommodate 500 cars.

At the TOI Ecopreneur Honours 2025 held in Delhi on Monday, a thought-provoking panel titled ""From Boardroom to the Road: Integrating Sustainability into India's Growth Strategy"" brought together top industry leaders who outlined how sustainability is no longer a corporate accessory but a foundational growth driver for India’s future.The session featured Anjali Ravi Kumar, chief sustainability officer at Zomato; Ram Kuppuswamy, COO of Hero MotoCorp; Pankaj Verma, chief sustainability officer at Adani Green Energy Limited; and Abhijeet Sinha, program director at National Highways for Electric Vehicles (NHEV). Each panelist detailed how their organisation is embedding sustainability into core operations—beyond CSR—and why doing so is key to long-term success.“We have always embedded sustainability at the heart of our products, services, and customer outreach,” said Kuppuswamy, stressing that Hero MotoCorp has intensified its green efforts over the past decade. “It’s not just a responsibility but a strategic necessity for all stakeholders.”Pankaj Verma echoed this sentiment, highlighting how Adani Green Energy has built its business model around sustainability.“From strategy to execution, we’ve aligned everything with long-term environmental goals. Even our suppliers are improving on these aspects,” he said, adding that their roadmap is reviewed and approved by the Board.Zomato’s Anjali Ravi Kumar noted that Gen Z and younger consumers are driving awareness. “Sustainability matters, but the primary functionality like delivery speed or pricing cannot be compromised. Green practices are now a value addition,” she said. She cited Zomato’s success in offsetting plastic waste: “Each of our food deliveries is 100% plastic neutral. We’ve recycled about 45,000 metric tonnes of plastic. ”Abhijeet Sinha brought a philosophical lens, urging India to develop a model based on indigenous thinking rather than replicating Western frameworks. “India’s green future must emerge from its own wisdom. If we fail to do this, we risk losing our identity,” he warned.The discussion also touched upon urban challenges like the worsening condition of Gurugram. Kuppuswamy pointed out that personal responsibility must go hand-in-hand with systemic reform, while Verma stressed the need to embed sustainability from the planning phase itself. Sinha added that the issue has become a matter of civic and electoral concern.Together, the panellists highlighted that India's green transformation will require both top-down strategies and grassroots participation.

TOI Ecopreneur Honours 2025: Youth-led movements and digital platforms drive environmental action,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/toi-ecopreneur-honours-2025-youth-led-movements-and-digital-platforms-drive-environmental-action/articleshow/123099288.cms,"TOI Ecopreneur Honours 2025

At the TOI Ecopreneur Honours 2025 held in Delhi on Monday, the first panel of the evening ,The Power of the Citizen: Redefining Environmental Activism in the Digital Age, showcased two young changemakers leading by example in the fight against climate change.Prachi Shevgaonkar, founder of Cool The Globe, and Malhar Kalambe, founder of Beach Please India, discussed how their grassroots movements have turned individual responsibility into large-scale environmental impact, using digital tools and community engagement as key drivers.Malhar Kalambe, whose journey began with a simple beach clean-up, highlighted the power of hands-on experience in shaping environmental consciousness. “You can’t learn about the environment in a classroom,” he said. “What we try to do through our community is give young people — even kids as young as six — the opportunity to physically clean beaches and rivers. Only then do they understand how serious the problem really is. ”Over 800 clean-up drives later, his initiative has removed over 8 million kilograms of waste and engaged 4.5 lakh citizens.Kalambe emphasised relatability and creativity on social media as essential tools in motivating youth.“We try to make beach clean-ups cool, something young people can relate to. A single social media post once brought in 6,000 volunteers.”For Shevgaonkar, personal climate anxiety led to innovation. Her journey began with a self-imposed challenge to reduce her carbon footprint by 10%, leading to the creation of Cool The Globe, a mobile app that tracks carbon savings from everyday actions like public transport use or waste segregation.“People often ask: what can one individual do?” she said. “When one lakh users from 150 countries came together, we saved over 7 million kilos of carbon emissions. That’s the power of collective action.” The app features a live global meter and has sparked a worldwide movement, with sustainability ambassadors in over 25 countries.She credited social media for helping create belief among ordinary people that their actions matter. “If we all do our part, miracles can happen,” Shevgaonkar said.The panel highlighted how India’s new wave of eco-champions is turning anxiety into action",The Power of the Citizen: Redefining Environmental Activism in the Digital Age showcased two young changemakers leading by example in the fight against climate change.

"Trump tariffs: India under fire from US over Russian oil imports; China buys more but escapes criticism, says GTRI",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/trump-tariffs-india-under-fire-from-us-over-russian-oil-imports-china-buys-more-but-escapes-criticism-says-gtri/articleshow/123109229.cms,"AI-generated image

As the tension between US and India escalate with regards to trade talks, a recent Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) report called out Donald Trump claiming the US President has been selectively criticising India regarding Russian oil imports while remaining silent about China's involvement.The report, cited by ANI, presented data showing China as the primary purchaser of Russian oil, with imports valued at $62.6 billion in 2024, exceeding India's USD 52.7 billion. Yet, Trump's criticism remains focused on India, overlooking China's more substantial involvement.""Trump appears unwilling to criticize China, perhaps because of geopolitical calculations, and instead targets India unfairly,"" GTRI said.The report contests Trump's recent Truth Social post claiming that India is ""buying massive amounts of Russian oil and selling it on the open market for big profits"", identifying this statement as inaccurate.The organisation clarifies that India does not export crude oil of any origin.As a net crude oil importer, India exports only refined petroleum products, including diesel and jet fuel, some derived from Russian crude, which is standard practice for energy-importing nations.GTRI further emphasised that Indian oil refineries maintain operational autonomy in sourcing crude oil.These entities operate without requiring governmental approval for oil purchases from Russia or other nations, basing decisions on business factors including pricing, reliable supply, and export destination regulations.The report indicates that Indian refiners might independently reduce or cease Russian imports if faced with secondary sanctions or limited market access.This shift is evident in the statistics, according to ANI citing the GTRI report, with India's Russian imports decreasing by 9.8 per cent to $9.2 billion in May 2025 compared to May 2024.The GTRI report determines that India faces unjust scrutiny while China's larger involvement remains unaddressed, potentially due to wider geopolitical considerations.MEA calls out US, EU over oil trade with Russia; pans double standardsThe GTRI report is aligned with MEA's response on Monday over India being targeted.India pushed back against Trump’s threat to significantly increase tariffs on Indian goods, attributed to the country’s ongoing oil imports from Russia, describing the move as “unjustified and unreasonable.” In a sharply worded statement, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) defended India’s energy strategy, stating that its purchases of crude oil from Russia are “a necessity compelled by global market conditions” and not a political endorsement of Moscow. “India will take all necessary measures to safeguard its national interests and economic security,” the MEA said, while highlighting that the US and European Union have themselves continued trade with Russia, including in energy and critical commodities, despite publicly opposing the Ukraine conflict.Read more: India calls out US, EU over oil trade with Russia; pans double standards","A recent Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) report called out Donald Trump for selectively criticising India regarding Russian oil imports.

Matt Deitke’s rise and how Mark Zuckerberg stepped in with a historic offer

Building Molmo and earning global recognition at the Allen Institute for AI



Vercept and Deitke’s vision for autonomous AI agents





In the rapidly evolving world of artificial intelligence, few names have made waves quite like Matt Deitke. At just 24, Deitke turned heads by rejecting a $125 million offer from Meta to join its elite AI division. What followed was even more astonishing: Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg personally met with him and doubled the offer to an eye-popping $250 million. Deitke’s decision to finally accept showcases the extraordinary lengths Big Tech is now going to in order to secure top AI talent. But who is Matt Deitke, and why is he considered one of the brightest minds in artificial intelligence today?Matt Deitke began his academic career in a PhD programme in computer science at the University of Washington. Despite his early academic promise, he left the programme to pursue more hands-on work in artificial intelligence. This move surprised many but proved instrumental in shaping his career. Deitke joined the Allen Institute for AI (AI2) in Seattle, where he quickly made a name for himself.At AI2, Deitke led the development of Molmo, a state-of-the-art multimodal chatbot capable of understanding and reasoning through a combination of text, images, and audio.His groundbreaking work earned him an Outstanding Paper Award at NeurIPS 2022, one of the most prestigious AI conferences in the world. With his rising reputation, it was not long before top tech companies began to notice.In 2024, Meta approached Deitke with a $125 million compensation package spread over four years to join its Superintelligence Lab. Surprisingly, he declined the offer, choosing to stay focused on independent research and his entrepreneurial ventures. Deitke reportedly felt that joining too early would limit his freedom to experiment—a value he deeply prioritizes in his research philosophy. Refusing to give up, Mark Zuckerberg personally met with Deitke to discuss Meta’s vision for the future of AI. Following their conversation, the offer was doubled to approximately $250 million, with up to $100 million front-loaded in the first year. It was one of the most generous recruitment packages in AI history. This time, Deitke accepted.Before joining Meta, Deitke had already made significant contributions to AI research. At the Allen Institute for AI, he helped pioneer work on Molmo (Multimodal Language Model), a system designed to move beyond traditional text-based interaction by integrating visual and auditory data. Unlike chatbots that rely solely on language models, Molmo could respond with images, reason through spatial information, and interpret sensory input in real time.Deitke’s work positioned him at the forefront of the next generation of AI tools—intelligent systems that combine perception and reasoning. His NeurIPS 2022 paper, which won an Outstanding Paper Award, drew attention for its bold approach to human-like AI reasoning. Molmo was even cited by OpenAI researchers as a benchmark system for cross-modal alignment testing, a rare recognition from rivals in the space. The achievement made Deitke not just a standout engineer but a thought leader in the AI space, someone capable of redefining how humans and machines interact.In late 2023, while still outside the Big Tech ecosystem, Deitke co-founded Vercept, a startup aimed at building AI agents that can autonomously perform complex tasks on the internet. Unlike conventional AI tools that rely on human prompts, Vercept’s agents are designed to understand goals, search the web, execute sequences of tasks, and adapt to new contexts. They essentially act like intelligent assistants with real-world functionality.Vercept began with just 10 employees but quickly attracted the attention of major investors. The company secured $16.5 million in early-stage funding, with notable backing from former Google CEO Eric Schmidt. The vision behind Vercept was simple but powerful: to create AI agents that don’t just talk, but act.Matt Deitke’s work at Vercept, combined with his academic and research accomplishments, painted a clear picture of his potential. As Big Tech continues its billion-dollar race to dominate AI, it is clear why Meta was willing to go to such extraordinary lengths to bring Deitke into the fold.","Matt Deitke is one of the brightest minds in artificial intelligence today.

$15,000 Bond Soon For US Visas

The Donald Trump administration has announced that some categories of visas may now require a $15,000 bond from the visitors before being issued by America. The regulation revives a measure from US President Donald Trump's first term's last days, designed to employ bonds as a ‘diplomatic tool’ to ensure visitors depart as scheduled, reports suggest.This initiative was unveiled through temporary final regulations on Monday, implementing a year-long pilot programme to assess its effectiveness.The US State Department has introduced a new policy requiring visitors from nations with substantial visa overstay rates to pay bonds up to $15,000 for tourism and business travel visas.Also Read | What is EB-5 visa?

The State Department's latest directive requires additional face-to-face interviews for numerous visa renewal candidates, eliminating previous exemptions.Furthermore, the department has proposed that participants in the Visa Diversity Lottery programme must have current passports from their citizenship countries.The visa bond requirement would exclude nationals from Visa Waiver Program participating countries, with potential exemptions available based on individual applicant conditions, according to an AP report.“In this temporary final rule (TFR), the Department of State (the Department) announces the commencement of a 12-month long visa bond pilot program. Aliens applying for visas as temporary visitors for business or pleasure (B-1/B-2) and who are nationals of countries identified by the Department as having high visa overstay rates, where screening and vetting information is deemed deficient, or offering Citizenship by Investment, if the alien obtained citizenship with no residency requirement, may be subject to the pilot program.

His legal team has argued that the judge made “multiple legal errors” in striking down what was then the largest executive compensation plan in corporate history, valued at over $50 billion.Earlier this year, Tesla said a special board committee had been formed to revisit Musk’s compensation, though it did not initially disclose details. The new award — nearly $29 billion based on current market prices — will require Musk to pay $23.34 per share of restricted stock, the same as the exercise price of his voided 2018 package.""While we recognize Elon's business ventures, interests, and other potential demands on his time and attention are extensive and wide-ranging ...we are confident that this award will incentivize Elon to remain at Tesla,"" the special committee said in its filing.Tesla’s board and Musk have repeatedly stated that increasing his voting power was essential to securing his continued leadership at the company, especially as it undergoes a strategic pivot.

"Bageshwar mining poses grave danger, government panel says in alarming report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/bageshwar-mining-poses-grave-danger-govt-panel-says-in-alarming-report/articleshow/123098878.cms,".





DEHRADUN: Unregulated mining in Bageshwar has triggered slope instability, spring depletion and land subsidence, creating conditions that mirror those seen in Jyotirmath (earlier named Joshimath) before its collapse, a technical committee told National Green Tribunal (NGT) on July 30 in an alarming report. The expert panel, constituted by the govt, warned that the region faced an impending disaster unless immediate corrective measures were taken to prevent further ecological and geological damage.The committee included experts from the Geological Survey of India, the Uttarakhand Landslide Mitigation and Management Centre, the Department of Geology and Mining, and the Indian Institute of Remote Sensing. It surveyed 61 soapstone mines across Bageshwar, Kanda and Dugnakuri tehsils, and found unsafe excavation practices such as vertical cutting without benches, direct dumping of mining debris into natural drainage, and encroachment near homes, fields and springs. The report flagged that these activities had made the terrain extremely prone to landslides and rockfalls, especially with the district falling under seismic zone V — the highest risk zone for earthquakes.The panel's report drew comparisons with the Jan 2023 Jyotirmath subsidence, where over 800 homes developed cracks due to poor drainage and construction in a geologically fragile zone. The committee said, ""A Jyotirmath-type crisis is in the making if the current practices continue.""The report also noted that there was inadequate documentation of slope modifications and no mapping of water resources, making regulation difficult and ineffective.Residents of Kanda-Kanyal valley, where a concentration of mines operates, had reported recurring landslides, cracks in houses, declining crop yields and drying of water sources. The team observed ground deformation and found that several springs had either deteriorated in quality or stopped flowing altogether. Satellite data confirmed ground shifts near mining sites. In some locations, mining activity extended within metres of houses and farmlands, violating environmental norms and compounding the risk of slope failure during monsoon.The panel recommended mandatory slope stability assessments, scientific monitoring using local seismic networks and satellite data, digitisation of mining leases, and mapping of local water sources. It also suggested enforcement of buffer zones between mines and human settlements, and holding leaseholders accountable for violations. NGT, which is hearing the matter, directed that mining must not resume in geotectonically sensitive areas unless a seismic study is completed and reviewed by a competent body.In Dec 2024, a court-appointed inspection team had flagged ""official obstruction"" during its visit to Bageshwar. The commissioners informed Uttarakhand high court that officers on site attempted to interfere with their inquiry, offered bribes, and discouraged villagers from speaking. Following this, HC stayed all mining activity in Bageshwar and later summoned DG of mines safety in Feb to explain why heavy machinery had been permitted despite existing court orders. Police later seized 124 excavators, and the state pollution control board suspended clearances for over 100 mines while issuing notices to 54 operators.During a hearing on June 9, HC directed GSI and the Central Ground Water Board to conduct a field inspection after villagers reported water accumulation in abandoned mine pits ahead of monsoon. The court noted that these artificial ponds, combined with choked natural drains, were increasing slope instability and could lead to widespread damage if not addressed before heavy rains. It also pointed out that many low-income families remained in affected areas, while those who could afford it had already moved out.","Unregulated mining in Bageshwar has triggered slope instability, spring depletion and land subsidence.

Yes, it affected my daily commute No, I found alternative transport





NEW DELHI: Public transport across Karnataka came to a grinding halt on Tuesday morning as employees of the state's road transport corporations launched an indefinite strike, leaving thousands of commuters stranded. The protest, sparked by long-pending demands for wage revision and salary arrears, continued despite an interim stay issued by the Karnataka high court.Passengers were left scrambling for alternatives, with bus services either suspended or severely limited in cities like Bengaluru, Mysuru, Hubballi, Dharwad, Kalaburagi, Raichur, Shivamogga, and Chikkamagaluru.Visuals from major bus stands show long queues and overcrowded platforms, while in districts like Gadag, not a single NWKRTC bus operated out of the daily fleet of over 500.Private operators and cab aggregators saw a spike in demand, with many passengers alleging overcharging by autorickshaws in Bengaluru and other cities. Commuters also criticized the state government for not addressing the issue sooner, even as disruption intensified.The strike follows the breakdown of negotiations between the Joint Action Committee of trade unions and the government. Employees are demanding clearance of 38 months' salary arrears and a wage revision effective from January 1, 2024.The government, however, has offered to settle only 14 months of dues, citing a one-man committee's recommendation.Despite the HC’s interim order on Monday urging unions to defer the strike and avoid disrupting essential public services, the unions proceeded. KSRTC Staff and Workers' Federation president H V Anantha Subbarao said, ""We are not satisfied. The strike will begin as planned. We want full 38 months' arrears.""The government has warned of disciplinary action. KSRTC MD Akram Pasha said circulars enforcing a 'no work, no pay' policy have already been issued and that transport is an essential service under the Karnataka Essential Services Maintenance Act. BMTC MD R Ramachandran added, ""Since BMTC provides essential services, employees are urged to not take part in the strike.""The high court bench expressed concern over the prolonged delay in wage payments and questioned the state on its handling of the issue. Although the government had held two rounds of talks with union leaders, no breakthrough was reached.With over 1.1 crore people relying on Karnataka's state-run buses daily — including 40 lakh commuters in Bengaluru alone — the impact of the strike was widespread. The government has reportedly prepared contingency measures involving private operators to keep limited services running.The situation remains tense, with uncertainty over how long the strike will last and whether the state will step in with a revised offer or harsher action.","Public transport across Karnataka came to a grinding halt on Tuesday morning.

Japan, a country known for its incredible life expectancy and vibrant elderly community, has celebrated yet another milestone in longevity. Shigeko Kagawa, a 114-year-old retired physician from Nara Prefecture, has officially been recognised as Japan’s oldest living person, according to the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare.This honour comes after the passing of Miyoko Hiroyasu, also aged 114, who previously held the title. Kagawa’s life, spanning more than a century, reflects Japan’s rich cultural heritage, advancements in healthcare, balanced diet, active lifestyles, and unique lifestyle choices often linked with exceptional longevity and healthy ageing trends in the region.Born in the early 20th century, Shigeko Kagawa’s life began in a very different Japan. She pursued higher education at a time when opportunities for women, particularly in medicine, were rare and challenging. Kagawa graduated from medical school before World War II, making her part of an early wave of women who broke gender barriers in healthcare.Her initial medical work was conducted in Osaka during wartime, a period marked by limited resources, societal upheaval, and urgent medical needs. She later returned to her hometown, where she took over her family’s clinic, serving as an obstetrician and gynecologist.Her work focused on women’s health, maternal care, and childbirth, areas that were vital for post-war recovery in Japanese society.Kagawa continued practicing medicine until the age of 86, demonstrating not only her professional dedication but also her remarkable physical and mental resilience.Even after retirement, Shigeko Kagawa’s life continued to inspire. In 2021, when the world was still recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic, she became one of the oldest Olympic torchbearers in history. Participating in the Tokyo 2021 Olympic Torch Relay at the age of 109 made headlines worldwide, symbolizing hope, perseverance, and the enduring spirit of the elderly community.Her appearance wasn’t just ceremonial—it carried a powerful message: age does not define one’s ability to contribute, inspire, and celebrate life. For many, Kagawa became a living example of Japan’s “ikigai” philosophy, which emphasizes having a purpose and joy in everyday life as a secret to longevity.When asked about her secret to longevity in a 2023 interview with TOS News, Shigeko Kagawa’s response was simple yet profound:“I don’t have any. I just play every day. My energy is my greatest asset. I go where I want, eat what I want, and do what I want. I’m free and independent.”Her lifestyle emphasises freedom, independence, and a playful approach to daily living. Unlike rigid dietary regimens or structured fitness programs often associated with longevity, Kagawa attributes her long life to mental well-being, active living, and personal happiness.These traits are common among centenarians, particularly in Japan, where psychological wellness and social connections often play as big a role as physical health in extending life expectancy.Shigeko Kagawa’s recognition as Japan’s oldest living person follows the death of Miyoko Hiroyasu, who had also lived to the remarkable age of 114. Hiroyasu, born in 1911, lived a life filled with creativity and education. She studied art in Tokyo, worked as a teacher in Hiroshima Prefecture, and raised three children.Her later years were spent in a nursing home in Oita Prefecture, where she enjoyed reading newspapers, sketching, and playing card games—activities that kept her mind active and engaged. On her 113th birthday, she expressed gratitude for her health and longevity, saying: “I am grateful to be healthy.”Hiroyasu’s life story, much like Kagawa’s, reflects the value of staying mentally and socially active, traits commonly linked with Japan’s exceptional number of centenarians.Japan holds a global record for life expectancy, with women often outliving men by several years. As of 1 September 2024, the country had 36 million people aged 65 or older, making up 29% of the total population—the highest proportion of elderly citizens in the world. Even more striking is the fact that 10% of Japan’s population is now aged 80 and above, according to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications. This demographic trend has profound implications for healthcare, social support, and economic planning.While longevity is often celebrated, it also presents challenges. A rapidly aging population increases demand for elder care, medical infrastructure, and pension systems. Policymakers are focusing on innovative solutions, such as robotics for elderly care, community-based support programs, and promoting healthy aging through technology and wellness education.At the same time, people like Shigeko Kagawa provide valuable insight into how to live a long, fulfilling life without rigid rules or extreme lifestyle changes. Her story resonates with younger generations who are increasingly seeking work-life balance, mental well-being, and personal freedom.Japan’s unusually high number of centenarians—individuals aged 100 and older—has long fascinated researchers and policymakers. Several factors contribute to this phenomenon:Japanese cuisine emphasizes fresh vegetables, fish, rice, seaweed, and fermented foods, all of which promote heart health and digestion. The traditional diet is low in processed sugars and saturated fats, reducing the risk of chronic diseases.Many elderly Japanese remain physically active through simple routines like walking, gardening, or even participating in community events, just as Kagawa did with the Olympic torch relay.Loneliness has been linked to reduced life expectancy globally, but Japan’s elderly often benefit from tight-knit communities, cultural respect for seniors, and strong family bonds.Japan’s universal healthcare system provides affordable medical access, ensuring early detection and treatment of diseases that might otherwise shorten life expectancy.The Japanese concept of “ikigai”, meaning a reason to live or purpose in life, is often cited as a key to longevity. People like Kagawa embody this philosophy by maintaining independence, enjoying simple pleasures, and staying engaged in meaningful activities.","Shigeko Kagawa, a 114-year-old retired physician from Nara Prefecture, has officially been recognised as Japan’s oldest living person. This honour comes after the passing of Miyoko Hiroyasu, also aged 114, who previously held the title.

‘Bill Gates has no role in toxic food coating’: Michelle Pfeiffer apologises after spreading misinformation; what is the controversy about Apeel’s food coating,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/bill-gates-has-no-role-in-toxic-food-coating-michelle-pfeiffer-apologises-after-spreading-misinformation-what-is-the-controversy-about-apeels-food-coating/articleshow/123037875.cms,"Bill Gates’ name wrongly linked to Apeel in viral misinformation

How did Apeel respond

Pfeiffer apologizes and retracts earlier claims

The larger debate on food tech, trust, and responsibility





In July 2025, actress Michelle Pfeiffer sparked controversy when she shared posts on social media claiming that Apeel, a food technology company backed by Bill Gates , was contaminating organic produce. Pfeiffer's posts stated that organic produce ""is no longer safe"" because Apeel's edible plant-based coating, recently approved by the USDA for organic certification, is invisible and ""cannot be washed off. "" She implied a direct connection between Gates and ownership of Apeel. Shortly after, Apeel clarified that Bill Gates has no ownership or involvement in the company beyond two small grants from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in 2012 and 2015. Pfeiffer later apologized, acknowledging she had shared outdated and inaccurate information about Apeel and its safety.Apeel Sciences, founded in 2012, develops an edible coating made from plant-derived ingredients such as citric acid and baking soda, designed to extend the shelf life of fruits and vegetables and reduce food waste. The product, called OrganiPeel, was formally FDA approved in 2024 and has been used in grocery stores since 2017. Apeel received two grants totaling approximately $1.1 million from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, but Bill Gates himself is neither a founder, shareholder, nor involved in operations. The company emphasizes its commitment to sustainability and improving food access worldwide.On July 10, 2025, Michelle Pfeiffer shared posts warning her followers that organic produce coated with Apeel was no longer safe to consume, emphasizing the coating's supposed invisibility and inability to wash off.She also posted a list of major grocery chains that do not sell Apeel-coated produce. These claims echoed long-running social media smear campaigns that falsely accused Apeel of contaminating food and overstated Gates's involvement. The misinformation prompted backlash from Apeel, its representatives, and many food safety experts who contested Pfeiffer’s assertions.Apeel representatives firmly denied the allegations related to food safety and company ownership. They stressed that their product is edible, made from responsibly sourced plant oils, and can be removed by simply rinsing and gently scrubbing produce. Apeel also clarified that Bill Gates has ""zero involvement or ownership"" in the company, and that the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation's funding was limited to grants with no controlling influence. The company reaffirmed its transparent mission to reduce food insecurity and improve sustainability in food systems.Three weeks after her initial posts, Pfeiffer returned to social media to issue a public apology. She admitted to unintentionally sharing outdated and inaccurate information about Apeel's product and ownership. Pfeiffer confirmed having spoken directly with Apeel representatives, learning that OrganiPeel is neither a new product nor exclusively linked to Bill Gates. She emphasized the importance of accurate public conversations on food safety and sustainability and expressed regret for spreading misinformation.This incident reflects ongoing tensions and misinformation in public discourse surrounding new food technologies and influential figures like Bill Gates. While some commentators applauded Pfeiffer for raising awareness, others criticized the spread of unverified claims that fuel distrust in science-based innovations. Apeel's case highlights the challenges companies face in balancing transparency, innovation, and public perception amid rapid advances in food technology. Pfeiffer's correction serves as a reminder of the responsibility public figures hold in verifying information before sharing it widely.","Actress Michelle Pfeiffer sparked controversy when she shared posts on social media claiming that Apeel, a food technology company backed by Bill Gates, was contaminating organic produce.

Billionaire Vinod Khosla says “College degrees are dead” as AI will disrupt education and replace expert jobs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/billionaire-vinod-khosla-says-college-degrees-are-dead-as-ai-will-disrupt-education-and-replace-expert-jobs/articleshow/123094534.cms,"



Vinod Khosla predicts AI tutors will surpass human educators

“College degrees are dead”: End of credentialism

Democratizing access to education and expertise

CK-12 and the future of adaptive education

Wider impact: Job disruption and new opportunities

In a bold prediction that challenges the foundations of modern education and white-collar work, billionaire venture capitalist Vinod Khosla has declared that traditional college degrees are becoming obsolete. Speaking in recent interviews and forums, Khosla argued that artificial intelligence will soon outpace elite human educators and professionals, ushering in a future where personalised, AI-driven learning replaces expensive universities—and expert jobs in law, finance, and healthcare are increasingly handled by machines. His vision portrays a near-future where curiosity, adaptability, and access to AI matter more than credentials.Khosla believes that AI tutoring systems will soon outperform even the most highly paid private teachers. These systems will offer continuous, personalized learning tailored to each student’s pace and style. In his view, a child in a remote village could soon receive better instruction from an AI tutor than a child at an elite school in a global city. He predicts that within five years, every student could access a free AI tutor, leading to a radical transformation in how we think about learning and its cost. He suggests this would flatten the global learning curve, giving every child—regardless of geography—a fair shot at academic success.According to Khosla, the dominance of college degrees and academic credentials is nearing its end. He argues that AI systems providing real-time, updated knowledge will erode the need for time-bound degrees and institutional validation. Skills will matter more than diplomas, and success will increasingly be measured by one’s ability to learn and adapt—not by a framed certificate. In this new landscape, curiosity-driven education will replace rigid curricula, empowering learners to switch disciplines without enrolling in long, expensive degree programs. He likens traditional degrees to outdated relics, calling them ""passports to the past, not tickets to the future.""A major emphasis of Khosla’s vision is accessibility. AI will remove geographical and economic barriers to education and professional guidance. From legal advice to financial planning and medical diagnostics, AI could deliver expert-level services to anyone with a smartphone. He suggests this could ease the burden on overworked courts, make quality healthcare accessible to rural areas, and allow even low-income individuals to receive reliable financial advice—unlocking upward mobility at scale.Khosla predicts that AI will deeply reshape white-collar professions. In law, AI could reduce case backlogs by offering free or low-cost legal support. In finance, smart algorithms will deliver tailored investment and savings strategies, even to people earning modest incomes. And in healthcare, he sees AI providing diagnostic support and treatment recommendations, democratizing what was once the preserve of elite specialists. Over the next 25 years, he believes many of these services could be available nearly for free.Highlighting existing examples, Khosla often points to CK-12, the nonprofit education platform co-founded by his wife Neeru Khosla, as a model of how AI-powered, adaptive learning can reach millions. Unlike traditional textbooks or courses, CK-12 tailors content based on student performance, offering a glimpse into how future AI tutors might work—scalable, personalized, and accessible to all, regardless of income or location.While Khosla acknowledges that AI may replace up to 80% of current jobs in the coming years, he also sees this shift as an opportunity. As specialized tasks become automated, the most valuable human skillsets will be generalist in nature: critical thinking, creativity, communication, and adaptability. He urges educators and policymakers to prepare for a world where lifelong learning, not career-long credentialism, is the norm.Vinod Khosla’s forecast is not merely about technology—it’s about a fundamental redistribution of opportunity. As AI breaks down traditional barriers to knowledge and professional advice, the gatekeepers of education and expertise lose their monopoly. The result, according to Khosla, will be a more equitable society—if people and institutions are willing to adapt. In his words, “This is not an improvement of the old system—it’s the end of the old system.”","Billionaire venture capitalist Vinod Khosla has declared that traditional college degrees are becoming obsolete.

"Over 3,000 Boeing fighter jet workers went on strike; here's why",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/over-3000-boeing-fighter-jet-workers-went-on-strike-heres-why/articleshow/123091474.cms,"Why Boeing fighter jet workers walked off the job

What Boeing’s unionised workforce is demanding

Boeing’s response to the walkout

What’s at stake for Boeing and US defense projects





More than 3,200 unionised Boeing workers in the St. Louis area and Illinois walked off the job on August 4 after overwhelmingly rejecting a second contract offer from the aerospace giant. These workers, who are responsible for assembling key US military aircraft like the F-15 and F/A-18 fighter jets, argue that the proposed agreement falls short of addressing their financial and workplace concerns. As Boeing’s defense business grows with new contracts like the F-47A, labor tensions are rising over what union leaders say is a disconnect between the company’s profits and the value of its frontline workers.The strike centers around dissatisfaction with Boeing’s proposed four-year contract, which included a 20% general wage increase, a $5,000 ratification bonus, and promises of better vacation time and sick leave. Boeing claimed the offer would raise average pay by 40%, but members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 837 weren’t convinced. They argued that the revised deal was nearly identical to an earlier version that had already been rejected.Workers say that despite inflation and record profits, their take-home pay has barely kept up with rising household costs. Many say they are working longer hours under tighter deadlines, without the recognition or resources they need. Workers say Boeing’s booming defense operations make it reasonable to expect a contract that keeps pace with rising living costs and recognizes their pivotal role in national security manufacturing.The workers’ demands go beyond higher wages. Union leaders have stressed the need for stronger job security protections, better healthcare benefits, and fairer compensation structures that reflect the growing workload. As Boeing increases its defense production, employees are asking for assurances that these new projects won’t result in excessive overtime without adequate compensation or the outsourcing of jobs.They also want clearer promotion pathways, more transparent performance evaluations, and increased retirement benefits to support long-term stability for workers and their families. According to District 837 President Tom Boelling, the workers “deserve a contract that reflects their skill, dedication, and the critical role they play in our nation’s defense.” The union sees this strike not just as a wage dispute, but as a stand for respect and investment in the skilled labor force powering Boeing’s defense ambitions.Boeing expressed disappointment at the rejection and said it was ready for the work stoppage, having implemented contingency plans to keep operations going. Dan Gillian, vice president and general manager of Boeing’s St. Louis defense facilities, called the offer “generous.” CEO Kelly Ortberg downplayed the strike’s impact in a call with analysts, citing past experiences with labor action, including a seven-week strike last year by a larger group of commercial aircraft builders in the Northwest.The walkout affects the assembly of several critical platforms including the F-15, F/A-18, T-7A Red Hawk trainer jet, and MQ-25 Stingray refueling drone. It also raises concerns about possible delays in production of the new F-47A, recently greenlit for the US Air Force. Any significant delay in these programs could ripple through the Pentagon’s procurement timeline, affecting both domestic readiness and international defense partnerships. With national security and multi-billion-dollar defense contracts on the line, the strike highlights the tensions between corporate cost control and labor rights — a balancing act Boeing must navigate carefully as it looks to lead the next generation of US military aviation.","More than 3,200 unionised Boeing workers in the St. Louis area and Illinois walked off the job on August 4.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has shifted from being a futuristic concept to a rapidly evolving reality impacting every industry. With advanced machine learning models, automation systems, and AI-powered decision-making tools, tasks once performed by humans are now handled with speed and precision by algorithms. This has triggered global concern about potential job losses. Top tech leaders have issued warnings that AI will significantly disrupt the workforce. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has admitted that automation will reduce certain jobs within the company. Similarly, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated that AI will impact “everybody’s jobs” in some capacity, although he expects it to also create new opportunities. Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis predicts the most dramatic changes will occur within the next five to ten years, transforming entire job markets.When asked about the possibility of artificial general intelligence (AGI) performing all human tasks, DeepMind CEO Hassabis highlighted an important distinction:AI could analyse medical data, scans, and test results faster and more accurately than human doctors, potentially replacing or assisting in diagnosis and treatment planning.Nurses, however, provide emotional support, physical care, and human empathy that technology can’t replicate. A robotic nurse may be efficient but lacks the ability to emotionally connect with patients, a critical part of caregiving.This example shows that while AI in healthcare may replace certain intellectual tasks, professions relying on emotional intelligence will remain human-centered.According to Hassabis, the workplace of the future will integrate humans and AI collaboratively. AI will handle data-heavy, repetitive, and analytical processes, allowing humans to focus on creative problem-solving, emotional interaction, and leadership roles. This shift will require governments and industries to invest heavily in reskilling programs to prepare workers for AI-driven environments, emphasizing lifelong learning, adaptive skills, ethical AI usage, and the development of new interdisciplinary roles bridging technology, creativity, and human-centric decision-making.Andy Jassy’s remarks highlight a future where AI automation tools replace repetitive and operational tasks. Amazon already relies on robotics and intelligent software to manage logistics, inventory, and supply chain processes. Jassy believes that as these technologies mature, fewer human workers will be required for jobs like order processing and warehouse management. However, he noted that the shift doesn’t necessarily mean fewer opportunities overall but rather a need for upskilling and reskilling so employees can transition into more technology-driven roles.Jensen Huang, whose company Nvidia provides the graphics processing units (GPUs) powering modern AI systems, offered a candid view on AI’s impact:“Everybody’s jobs will be affected. Some jobs will be lost. Many jobs will be created.” Huang believes AI’s productivity gains will help industries perform tasks faster and cheaper, which may reduce demand for certain roles but open new ones focused on AI development, data analysis, and advanced engineering. He expressed hope that economic growth from AI adoption will ultimately “lift society” rather than harm it.Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind and a key architect of advanced AI systems, views AI as an additive rather than purely disruptive technology. He explained that as AI capabilities expand, new job categories will emerge—roles that use AI to enhance human output rather than replace it entirely. Historically, technological revolutions (like industrial machines or computers) displaced certain jobs but also created industries that didn’t exist before. Hassabis believes this trend will continue:“New jobs will be created that are actually better, that utilise these tools or new technologies.”AI can handle data analysis, diagnostics, and treatment recommendations faster than humans, but doctors will still oversee complex decision-making and patient care.Nursing requires emotional support, hands-on care, and human empathy—qualities that machines and robots cannot replicate effectively.He predicts massive workplace changes within 5–10 years, with some jobs disappearing and new ones emerging.Amazon CEO Andy Jassy expects automation to cut some jobs, while Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang believes AI will affect “everybody’s jobs” but also create new opportunities.Roles focused on AI development, creative problem-solving, emotional intelligence, and advanced data management are expected to increase.",Top tech leaders have issued warnings that AI will significantly disrupt the workforce.

Foxconn sells Lordstown plant for $88 million but keeps EV production running while expanding US growth plans,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/foxconn-sells-lordstown-plant-for-88-million-but-keeps-ev-production-running-while-expanding-us-growth-plans/articleshow/123094141.cms,"Source: Reuters and Automotive News

Foxconn sells Lordstown plant while boosting US EV plans



Why Foxconn chose Crescent Dune as existing partner for its Lordstown sale



Foxconn continues EV production at Lordstown after $88 million sale



Foxconn expands US footprint with focus on EVs and advanced manufacturing



Taiwanese manufacturing giant Foxconn (2317.TW) has finalised the sale of its former Lordstown, Ohio factory for $88 million, as revealed in recent regulatory filings. The facility’s new owner, Crescent Dune LLC, has been described by Foxconn as an ‘existing business partner’, indicating a continued strategic relationship. Despite the transfer of ownership, Foxconn confirmed it will remain an occupant of the plant, ensuring ongoing production and operations remain unaffected. The company further announced plans to reinvest the sale proceeds into US-based initiatives, reinforcing its commitment to building a long-term industrial and manufacturing presence in the United States. The deal reflects Foxconn’s evolving strategy to optimise assets while supporting its growth in electric vehicles and advanced manufacturing sectors.The Lordstown site has a long history in American automotive manufacturing. It previously belonged to Lordstown Motors Corp, an electric vehicle startup that acquired the property from General Motors after GM closed its plant there in 2019. Lordstown Motors aimed to revive the region’s auto industry with its electric pickup truck program. However, due to financial struggles, production delays, and eventual bankruptcy, Lordstown Motors sold the facility to Foxconn in 2022 for $230 million as reported by Reuters.For Foxconn, known globally for assembling consumer electronics like the iPhone, the acquisition marked its entry into electric vehicle manufacturing—a strategic move to diversify beyond electronics and capitalise on the growing EV market.The buyer, Crescent Dune LLC, is described by Foxconn as an ‘existing business partner’, but little is publicly known about its operations or specific business model. By transferring ownership to a trusted partner while remaining a tenant, Foxconn benefits from the facility without bearing the long-term cost of ownership.This sale-and-leaseback arrangement is common in manufacturing, allowing companies to unlock capital tied up in real estate and redirect it into core business expansion. For Foxconn, this means focusing funds on scaling electric vehicle production, research, and emerging US manufacturing projects.Despite the ownership change, Foxconn emphasised that its current workforce and operations will remain intact. The company will continue using the facility to support electric vehicle programs, component manufacturing, and advanced production initiatives. This approach minimises operational disruption and ensures that the strategic objectives behind the initial Lordstown acquisition remain in place.At first glance, the difference between the $230 million purchase price in 2022 and the $88 million sale price may raise eyebrows. However, this is part of a long-term financial and operational restructuring strategy. By selling the real estate and reinvesting in its high-growth business segments, Foxconn can focus resources on innovation, partnerships with EV startups, and digital manufacturing infrastructure instead of tying capital in physical property ownership.Lordstown and surrounding areas have faced economic turbulence since General Motors shuttered operations, leading to job losses and economic uncertainty. The arrival of Foxconn initially generated optimism, particularly for skilled labor and EV industry growth. With the company continuing operations at the same facility, the local economy may still benefit from jobs and advanced manufacturing expertise. Additionally, partnerships like these often attract ancillary businesses and encourage regional supply chain growth.Foxconn has long signalled plans to expand its US footprint beyond electronics. Its entry into electric vehicles, semiconductors, and digital infrastructure manufacturing demonstrates a strategic shift toward next-generation industries. By divesting real estate while remaining operational, Foxconn is showing a preference for flexibility and scalability in its US strategy.The move aligns with Foxconn’s collaborations with EV startups and established automakers, leveraging its experience in high-volume, precision manufacturing to serve one of the world’s fastest-growing industries.","Taiwanese manufacturing giant Foxconn has finalised the sale of its former Lordstown, Ohio factory for $88 million.

Mark Zuckerberg’s offer and Tulloch’s viral rejection





Andrew Tulloch, an Australian computer scientist and machine learning expert, has made headlines after turning down a $1.5 billion offer from Mark Zuckerberg to rejoin Meta. A former OpenAI engineer, Tulloch is now the co-founder of Thinking Machines Lab alongside ex-OpenAI CTO Mira Murati. The AI startup, still in its early stages, is already valued at $12 billion. Tulloch’s decision to decline Zuckerberg’s aggressive recruitment attempt reflects a broader trend of top AI talent prioritizing independence, mission-driven work, and long-term impact over staggering financial packages.Tulloch’s journey began at the University of Sydney, where he graduated with first-class honours and a University Medal in mathematics. He later earned a Master’s in Mathematical Statistics from Cambridge and pursued a PhD at UC Berkeley. Tulloch worked at Meta (then Facebook) from 2012 to 2023, contributing to machine learning systems and the development of PyTorch. He joined OpenAI in 2023, focusing on GPT-4 pretraining and reasoning models, before co-founding Thinking Machines Lab in early 2025. Unlike many AI engineers who stay within big tech, Tulloch has consistently sought out roles where he can shape core AI architecture rather than optimize existing systems.Co-founded with Mira Murati, Thinking Machines Lab is focused on building AI systems that are safer, interpretable, and customizable—going beyond traditional chatbot interfaces. The startup, though yet to release a product, has secured a $2 billion seed round with backing from Andreessen Horowitz, Nvidia, AMD, and Google Cloud. Its ambition and leadership have made it a top target for recruitment, especially from Zuckerberg's new ""superintelligence"" division at Meta. Industry insiders say the startup has quietly attracted talent from DeepMind, Anthropic, and OpenAI—further signaling that it may become a major challenger in the foundation model race.According to The Wall Street Journal, Zuckerberg personally tried to lure Tulloch back to Meta with a six-year offer worth up to $1.5 billion, contingent on bonuses and stock performance. Tulloch declined, joining other Thinking Machines Lab co-founders in resisting Meta’s poaching attempts. The bold rejection has gone viral, with Tulloch’s LinkedIn profile celebrated for charting a rare career driven by principles rather than payouts. Meta later disputed the exact terms of the offer but confirmed outreach efforts were made.","Andrew Tulloch, an Australian computer scientist and machine learning expert, has made headlines after turning down a $1.5 billion offer from Mark Zuckerberg to rejoin Meta.

Government systems potentially exposed to foreign oversight

Microsoft announced last month that Chinese state-sponsored hackers exploited vulnerabilities in its SharePoint collaboration software to breach hundreds of companies and government agencies, including the National Nuclear Security Administration and Department of Homeland Security.

The revelation raises serious questions about potential security risks when foreign personnel maintain critical US government systems.ProPublica's investigation revealed that Microsoft's China-based engineering team has been responsible for maintaining SharePoint software for years, supervised by a US-based engineer. The company stated that work is ""already underway to shift this work to another location"" following the security breach.The timing proves particularly concerning given that Microsoft's analysis showed Chinese hackers were exploiting SharePoint weaknesses as early as July 7. Despite Microsoft releasing a patch on July 8, hackers successfully bypassed the initial fix, forcing the company to issue additional ""more robust protections.""Cybersecurity experts warn that allowing China-based personnel to perform technical support on US government systems creates major security vulnerabilities. Chinese laws grant officials broad authority to collect data, making it difficult for citizens or companies to resist direct requests from security forces.The Office of the Director of National Intelligence has identified China as the ""most active and persistent cyber threat"" to US government and critical infrastructure networks. The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency confirmed that the SharePoint vulnerabilities enable hackers to ""fully access SharePoint content"" and execute malicious code.This latest revelation follows ProPublica's previous reporting that Microsoft has relied on foreign workers, including China-based engineers, to maintain Defense Department cloud systems for over a decade.

Once known primarily for rebounds and reality TV headlines, Tristan Thompson has taken a new kind of shot as he appeared at the White House. The NBA champion turned podcast host recently sat down with Bo Hines, Executive Director of the White House Digital Assets Council, for a revealing conversation on cryptocurrency. And while fans were stunned by the setting, Thompson made it clear that his interest in blockchain technology has the potential to change everything as he discussed the same with the top Donald Trump official.Tristan Thompson has returned to the White House. The 34-year-old “Courtside Crypto” podcast host was there to discuss digital currency with Bo Hines, a top figure in the Donald Trump administration's digital asset initiative. The two dived into the evolving future of crypto in America.“One thing about myself, the people at home, and the people in the trenches, they were so excited when President Trump said, 'We're gonna be the crypto Bitcoin president of the United States.' That made people so excited,” Thompson told Hines.He added, “When people hear ‘crypto,’ they still think of scams or speculation. But what they don’t see is how blockchain can impact healthcare, education, and even how we buy homes.This is an infrastructure revolution, and we need to help people understand it.”Hines, who praised Thompson for using his platform to educate the public, responded, “You, with your platform, I think you’ve just done a phenomenal job helping to educate folks. To help them understand the technology here that’s being built, and coming from the crypto industry, it’s going to have a huge impact on their lives in a positive way.”Thompson has shown continued commitment to tech innovation beyond crypto. He also serves as Chief Content Officer and Lead Advisor for TracyAI, a platform that brings real-time analysis to sports broadcasts using artificial intelligence. “I want my kids to buy their first home with stablecoins, no bank wires, no ten forms to sign.

‘Unable to accept erosion of its dominance’: Russia slams Trump’s tariffs; hails Brics-Global South unity,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/unable-to-accept-erosion-of-its-dominance-russia-slams-trumps-tariffs-hails-brics-global-south-unity/articleshow/123109234.cms,"



Russia has accused the United States of pushing a ""neocolonial agenda"" after President Donald Trump announced substantial hike in tariffs on the global south. In a sharp rebuke, Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the move reflected Washington’s inability to cope with a shifting global order.""Sanctions and restrictions have unfortunately become a defining feature of the current historical period,"" Zakharova said in response to a media query on the US decision to tighten tariffs against countries in the Global South.""Unable to accept the erosion of its dominance in an emerging multipolar international order, Washington continues to pursue a neocolonial agenda, employing politically motivated economic pressure against those who choose an independent course on the international stage.""Zakharova asserted that no sanctions or tariff wars would stop the evolution of the international system. ""Nonetheless, we firmly believe that no tariff wars or sanctions can halt the natural course of history. We are supported by a vast number of partners, like-minded states, and allies, particularly among the countries of the Global South and, above all, within Brics, who share this perspective,"" she said.Zakharova accused the United States of violating the very principles of free trade it once championed, pointing to what she called ""politically driven protectionism and the arbitrary imposition of tariff barriers.""She named Brazil—Russia’s strategic partner in Latin America—as one of the main victims of such policies, and said these actions amount to interference in other countries' internal affairs and pose a broader threat to global economic stability.""We stand ready to deepen cooperation with them to resist unlawful unilateral sanctions and to help shape a genuinely multipolar, just, and equitable international order,” Zakharova said.Her remarks came in response to Trump’s statement on Truth Social, where he accused India of profiting from reselling Russian oil and declared that the US would “substantially raise the tariff paid by India.”India has pushed back strongly, calling the criticism ""unjustified and unreasonable."" The Ministry of External Affairs in New Delhi said that India’s imports are driven by national interest and energy security, and pointed to ongoing US and EU trade with Russia in energy and other sectors.","Russia has accused the United States of pushing a ""neocolonial agenda"" after President Donald Trump announced substantial hike in tariffs on the global south.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.
