'Diluting quality of army training': Tharoor attacks Centre over Agniveer scheme,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/diluting-quality-of-army-training-tharoor-attacks-centre-over-agniveer-scheme/articleshow/112055449.cms,"NEW DELHI: Attacking the Centre's Agniveer scheme , Congress MP Shashi Tharoor said that by training soldiers for just six months and allowing them to serve for only 3-4 years, the government is undermining the quality of training and the professional opportunities available to the Indian Army .""The professional reputation of the Indian Army is extremely high around the world.It's considered one of the most professional armies in the world and maintaining that professionalism is in the interest of the entire nation. When you create a situation where soldiers can be trained for 6 months and serve for 3-4 years, you are diluting the quality of training and professional opportunities available to the Indian Army,"" Tharoor said.""I believe it is deeply damaging, the only rationale for it is indeed to save money on the pension and therefore I think that the Congress stands justified in its insistence that we will scrap the scheme when we come to power,"" he added.Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday addressed in Ladakh's Kargil on the occasion of 25th Kargil Vijay Diwas , in which he stressed on Agniveer scheme, saying, that the scheme aims to rejuvenate the Army and ensure its continuous readiness for war. PM Modi noted that such major reforms have been a long-standing demand.""The country has felt the need for major reforms in the defence sector for decades. The army has been demanding this for years, but unfortunately, it was not given enough importance earlier. The Agnipath scheme is also an example of the necessary reforms done in the Army. For decades, discussions have been going on in Parliament and many committees on making the army young,"" Prime Minister said during his address.Several BJP-ruled state chief ministers have announced reservations for Agniveers in their respective states.Rajasthan chief minister Bhajanlal Sharma said that the government will provide reservations for Agniveers in the police department, as well as for prison guards and forest guards, once they complete their service in the Indian Army.Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma also announced that his government will recruit most Agniveers into the state police.Odisha chief minister Mohan Charan Majhi announced a 10 percent quota and a five-year age relaxation for Agniveers in uniformed services.Madhya Pradesh chief minister Mohan Yadav announced that Agniveer Jawans will receive reservations in the recruitment of police and armed forces in the state.Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also announced that Agniveers, after their service, will be given priority in recruitment for the UP Police and Provincial Armed Constabulary (PAC) forces. He noted that the nation would benefit from having trained and disciplined young soldiers through the Agniveer program.","Congress MP Shashi Tharoor said that by training soldiers for just six months and allowing them to serve for only 3-4 years, the government is undermining the quality of training and the professional opportunities available to the Indian Army.

Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman did not have anything specifically for Tamil Nadu , but the state is likely to benefit from some of the measures announced in the Budget. Here are five of them.Farmers in Tamil Nadu too can reap the benefits of the Budget’s push to enhance productivity and resilience in the agriculture sector. For example, the launch of 109 new high-yielding and climate-resilient varieties of 32 field and horticulture crops, missions for pulses and oilseeds, and promotion of natural farming.Setting up digital public infrastructure f o r agriculture helps too. S Chandramohan, director and group president, finance & investment, TAFE said, “The digitisation of agri records will help farmers; proper land records will also help them get loans.”The range of measures for MSMEs will help Tamil Nadu, which is home for the second largest number of such units in the country. The employment-linked incentive schemefor hiring freshers will encourage MSMEs to recruit young graduates, said T T Keshav, co-convenor, CII Tamil Nadu CEO forum. “In Tamil Nadu, MSMEs offer the first job for most freshers hailing from smaller towns. With MSMEs facing shortage of employees and financial constraints, this announcement will be a booster to absorb more new graduates,” he added.Financial support for setting up a network of nucleus breeding centres for shrimp broodstock and reduction in basic customs duty on certain broodstock, polychaete worms, shrimp and fish feed to 5% will help coastal states such as Tamil Nadu. Seafood Exporters Association of India president Pawan Kumar G said, “We welcome the announcement because the govt has started focusing and recognised it is an important sector. Implementation must be expedited.” In 2023-24, Tamil Nadu exported marine products worth $484 million.The budget has slashed basic custom duty (BCD) for mobile phones, chargers and printed circuit board assembly of mobile phones. It also removed BCD for specified goods used for manufacturing connectors and resistors and duty on critical minerals including copper, lithium and silicon. This is expected to increase localisation of the electronics supply chain.Tamil Nadu has a major share in the country’s $14 billion Apple iPhones manufacturing. Dr Veerapan, chairman of Indian electronics and semiconductor association (IESA), said, “Funding for product development and creation of the electronics ecosystem will play a crucial role in building the component ecosystem.”BCD for spandex yarn raw material has been cut from 7.5% to 5%. Tanned leather, wet white leather, crust leather and finished leather included under the duty-free scheme for leather product exporters. Export duty on wet blue and crust leather also cut.“This step will help increase leather and footwear exports to $13.7 billion by 2030 from $4.70 billion at present,” said Rajendra Kumar Jalan, chairman of council for leather exports (CLE). Textile exporters say reduction of customs duty and credit guarantee for purchase of machinery for MSMEs will help the textile industry.K Venkatachalam, chief advisor of Tamil Nadu Spinning Mills Association, said one has to wait and see whether some of these benefits will be passed on to the customers. “Some long-pending demands for removal of import duty on cotton, withdrawal of quality control orders on viscose and polyester fibres were not met.”",Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman did not have anything specifically for Tamil Nadu.

NEET-UG scam: Number of toppers set to drop from 61 to 17 in revised list,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/neet-ug-scam-toppers-number-set-to-drop-from-61-to-17-in-revised-list/articleshow/112024237.cms,"NEW DELHI: The number of toppers in the NEET-UG exam is set to come down to 17 from 61 when National Testing Agency ( NTA ) announces the revised merit list , most likely on Friday.Revision of the merit list was necessitated after IIT-Delhi , working at Supreme Court's instance, recommended that only one of the options in a question in the physics paper was correct.Several students had complained that two of the four options could be held to be correct going by different NCERT books. With only one answer being deemed correct, those who had chosen the other option lost five marks (four marks for wrong answer and one negative mark), in what was sure to have a cascading effect on the ranks of all those who took the exam.This decision will primarily impact the scores of 4.2 lakh candidates, including 44 who achieved perfect scores of 720, because they had opted for the answer deemed incorrect by IIT-Delhi and for which they had been awarded four marks earlier by NTA. “The number of toppers, which stands at 61, will come down to 17, post the deduction of marks,” an NTA official said.The change in ranking could prove to be crucial for many students considering that over 24 lakh aspirants took the NEET-UG for the 1.08 medical seats up for grabs in the country. Of these, 56,000 seats are in govt institutions, which are much sought after for their better infrastructure and lower fees.According to sources, the biggest impact will be on candidates ranked between 50,000 to 1 lakh as over 16,000 candidates, who were earlier likely to earn a seat in a medical college, are likely to go out of the cohort.Sources said the impact on the 44 students, who will no longer be toppers, will not be much as they would still feature in the rank cohort of 33,000 to 50,000 but change in their ranks will impact their chance of securing seats in govt medical colleges of their choice.",The number of toppers in the NEET-UG exam is set to come down to 17 from 61 when National Testing Agency ( NTA ) announces the revised merit list.Revision of the merit list was necessitated after IIT-Delhi recommended that only one of the options in a question was correct.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112024337,imgsize-98584,width-400,resizemode-4/112024337.jpg"

'Behave, It's Her Maiden Speech': Kangana's Big Claim In Lok Sabha Triggers Uproar

NEW DELHI: Politics in Andhra Pradesh is on the boil with chief minister Chandrababu Naidu continuing with his attacks on his predecessor Jagan Mohan Reddy . A day after comparing former state chief minister Reddy to Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar over alleged drug menace in the state, Naidu on Friday alleged that the five-year rule by the YSRCP had destroyed the state's economy which had led to a loss of up to Rs 7 lakh crore revenue.Naidu alleged that state's debt rose from Rs 3.75 lakh crore on March 31, 2019 to Rs 9.74 lakh crore by June 12, 2024.Naidu, who is on a spree of releasing white papers on different aspects of governance under Jagan Mohan Reddy in the last 5 years, released details of state's finances in the assembly and alleged that Andhra's economy was destroyed between 2019 and 2024. On Thursday, Naidu had released white paper on law and order and the ganja (marijuana) prevalence and had claimed that Andhra had emerged as ganja capital between 2019 and 2024.Naidu has also released white paper on the excise policy of the previous government and has said the state government would soon order a probe by the CID into the large-scale irregularities in the Excise Department during the YSR Congress Party rule. The chief minister alleged that the state suffered a loss of Rs 18,860.51 crore with the change in liquor policy after the YSRCP came to power in 2019.The chief minister has alleged that misrule in the state started after Reddy took over the reins of the government. This led to looting of natural resources, anti-industrial policies, change of policy on capital city and destruction of the Polavaram project , Naidu alleged.The new government has published seven white papers for every citizen to understand the real extent of the previous government's mismanagement.Meanwhile, Jagan Mohan Reddy hit back at Chandrababu Naidu and said the chief minister is backing off from presenting a regular budget as he would be compelled to incorporate poll promises in it. The former chief minister alleged that Naidu does not have the boldness to table a regular budget, which generally is for 12 months. Recently, Naidu had announced in assembly that the state budget will be presented after two months due to 'financial constraints'.""If he presents a regular budget then he has to show the fake promises he had made during polls in the regular budget. If those super six promises do not reflect, he (Naidu) thought people will open their mouths,"" said Reddy.What are the Super Six promises made by Chandrababu Naidu to people of Andhra PradeshJagan, who staged protest at Delhi's Jantar Mantar against alleged political violence in Andhra Pradesh, got support from several INDIA bloc members and AIADMK leaders. Ironically, the YSRCP is not a member of the opposition INDIA bloc, and had previously maintained issue-based support to the Modi government. Samajwadi Party (SP) supremo Akhilesh Yadav, Shiv Sena (UBT) leaders Sanjay Raut and Priyanka Chaturvedi, the TMC's Nadimul Haq, and the AIADMK's M Thambidurai were among those who condemned the alleged attacks on YSRCP workers in Andhra Pradesh.Questioning if the state is moving forward or going back 52 days after the declaration of the election results, Reddy alleged atrocities such as murders, rapes and destruction of assets were rampant. He alleged victims were being booked while the police department was playing the role of a spectator under the allegedly oppressive rule of the TDP-led government, which also includes the BJP and the Janasena.(With inputs from agencies)",Chief minister Chandrababu Naidu continues his attacks on his predecessor Jagan Mohan Reddy.

PM Modi defends Agnipath: Will keep forces combat-ready,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-modi-defends-agnipath-will-keep-forces-combat-ready/articleshow/112050792.cms,"(Referring to Pak) Today, I am speaking from a place where the patrons of terrorism can hear me... their nefarious intentions will never succeed. Our brave soldiers will crush terrorism with full force. PM Modi

DRASS (KARGIL): Strongly defending the Agnipath scheme that has faced criticism from several quarters, PM Narendra Modi on Friday said short-term recruitment of soldiers was necessary for keeping the armed forces young and combat-ready at all times, and accused the opposition of trying to mislead the youth and playing politics over national security issues.Addressing the 25th Kargil Vijay Diwas celebrations at Drass, Modi said his govt had made defence reforms a top priority unlike previous regimes, rubbishing claims that the Agnipath scheme rolled out in June 2022 was meant to save pension money.“The fact that the average age of Indian soldiers was higher than the global average was a major concern discussed in Parliament and various committees for decades, but there was no will power to address it. The aim of Agnipath is to make the armed forces younger and keep them continuously fit for war,” Modi said, in his first public response to attacks on Agnipath scheme by opposition which made the short-tern recruitment scheme one of the key themes of the Lok Sabha election campaign.It is “necessary reform” undertaken by the military, PM stressed.“Unfortunately, such a sensitive issue related to national security has been made a subject of politics by some people. They are the same people who weakened our armed forces by committing scams worth thousands of crores. They are the ones who did not want IAF to get modern fighter jets (Rafales). They had also made preparations to lock the (indigenous) Tejas fighter in a box,” he said, taking a swipe at the previous UPA govt by recalling that the Army lacked bulletproof jackets before he took over and the UPA govt allocated Rs 500 crore for one rank-one pension scheme.The very same people are spreading the canard that the govt came with the Agnipath scheme to save pension money, said Modi, stressing that the question of pension for those being recruited today would arise after 30 years. “By then, I would be 105. Why would the govt take a decision for it today and face abuse? We could have left that for the govts in the future. But we respected this decision taken by the forces because for us, the security of the country is paramount, not party or politics,” he said. “The truth is that the Agnipath scheme will increase the country’s strength and the country will also get capable youth. Announcements have earlier been made about giving priority (in jobs) to Agniveers in the private sector and paramilitary forces.”The PM said those “misleading” the youth today had no regard for the armed forces in the past. In this context, he cited his govt’s implementation of the “one rank, one pension (OROP)” scheme, under which ex-servicemen have been given more than Rs 1.25 lakh crore till now, and the construction of the national war memorial.Stressing the importance of upgrading military technologies amid the ongoing geopolitical flux, the PM said the armed forces not only need the latest weapons and equipment, but also “a modern working style and arrangements”. “In the last 10 years, defence reforms have been prioritised, making our forces more capable and self-reliant,” he said.A major stake in defence procurements is now being given to the Indian defence industry, while 25% of the defence R&D has also been reserved for the private sector. “As a result of these efforts, India’s annual defence production has crossed the Rs 1.25 lakh crore-mark,” the PM said.“In the past, India was counted only as an arms importer, but now the country is also making its mark as an arms exporter,” he added, expressing happiness that the armed forces have decided to stop importing more than 5,000 defence products and items.",PM Narendra Modi said short-term recruitment of soldiers was necessary for keeping the armed forces young and combat-ready at all times. Modi said his govt had made defence reforms a top priority unlike previous regimes. He rubbished claims that the Agnipath scheme rolled out in June 2022 was meant to save pension money.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112050867,imgsize-990504,width-400,resizemode-4/112050867.jpg"

What Supreme Court has said in the past

'Playing with fire'

NEW DELHI: Trinamool Congress-ruled West Bengal and CPM-led LDF government in Kerala, who have had prolonged faceoff with their respective governors, would finally hope of some resolution with the Supreme Court taking note of their pleas alleging denial of assent to bills passed by the respective legislative assemblies. The top court, in the past, has taken very strict view of governors sitting over bills passed by state assemblies, giving hope to the two states.The CPM-led Left Democratic Front government of Kerala had moved the top court in March alleging that certain bills cleared by legislative assembly were referred to President by the governor and these were still pending assent.West Bengal, in its plea, has alleged that the state governor was withholding assent on eight bills. The state also claimed that West Bengal governor had referred some of the pending bills to President when he got to know that the matter was coming up for hearing in the top court.The top court issued notices to Union ministry of home affairs and the secretaries of Kerala governor Arif Mohammad Khan and his West Bengal counterpart CV Ananda Bose and sought their replies within three weeks.The bench of Chief Justice DY Chandrachud, Justice JB Pardiwala and Justice Manoj Misra also directed the Trinamool Congress-led West Bengal government to make the home ministry a party to the petition.Senior advocate KK Venugopal, appearing for the Kerala government, challenged the reference of bills to the President. Kerala said its plea pertained to the acts of the governor in reserving seven bills, which he was required to deal with himself, to the president. Not one of the seven bills had anything to do with Centre-state relations, it said.Kerala's counsel added these bills were pending with the governor for as long as about two years and his action ""subverted"" the functioning of the state legislature, rendering its very existence ""ineffective and otiose"".Senior advocate Abhishek Singhvi, appearing for West Bengal, said he would make the Centre a party and file a written note to assist the court in deciding the plea.He referred to instances of other states, including Tamil Nadu, and said the moment the top court fixed the cases for hearing, certain bills were either cleared or referred to the President.Venugopal said there was a need for the top court to lay down guidelines on when the governors could return or refer the bills.The Constitution is silent on how much time President can take in granting assent to a bill passed by a state legislature and referred to the Rashtrapati Bhavan for presidential consideration or for denying consent.Article 361 of the Constitution says the President, or the governor of a state, shall not be answerable to any court for the exercise and performance of the powers and duties of his office or for any act done or purporting to be done by him in the exercise and performance of those powers and duties.West Bengal, in its plea, said the denial of assent without assigning any reason to the bills passed by the assembly was contrary to Article 200 of the Constitution.The article provides for the process for a bill passed by the assembly of a state to be presented to the governor for assent. The governor may either assent or withhold assent or reserve the bill for consideration by the president.When a bill has been passed by the legislative assembly of a state or, in the case of a state having a legislative council, has been passed by both Houses of the legislature of the state, it shall be presented to the governor and the governor shall declare either that he assents to the bill or that he withholds assent therefrom or that he reserves the bill for the consideration of the President.This is not the first time that faceoff between state government and governor has reached the doors of Supreme Court. The apex court has dealt with similar petitions from Tamil Nadu and Punjab governments and has made some very strong observations on the issue. ""Our country has been running on established traditions and conventions and they need to be followed,"" the top court has said in its earlier judgments on the issue.When Tamil Nadu governor R N Ravi had refused assent to bills, the Supreme Court, referring to Article 200 of the Constitution, said the governor cannot send the bills to the President after they were readopted by the legislative assembly upon getting them back from the office of the governor earlier.The top court had also questioned the delay on the part of Ravi in granting assent to several Bills passed by the state assembly, asking why should governors wait for parties to move the top court with their grievances.In the case of Punjab, the Supreme Court had told the then governor Banwarilal Purohit ""you are playing with fire."" The top court expressed serious concern over the deadlock in Punjab and took a stern view of state governor not giving assent to bills passed by the state assembly.(With inputs from agencies)","West Bengal and Kerala have had prolonged faceoff with their respective governors. The Supreme Court has taken note of their pleas alleging denial of assent to bills. The top court, in the past, has taken very strict view of governors sitting over bills passed by state assemblies.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112048826,imgsize-48196,width-400,resizemode-4/112048826.jpg"

PM targets opposition over Agniveer scheme





Opposition accuses PM Modi of 'petty politics'





NEW DELHI: On the Kargil Vijay Diwas, as opposition cornered PM Modi-led NDA government over the Agniveer scheme , the Bharatiya Janata Party-ruled states moved to provide job reservations to the ex-servicemen. In back-to-back statements, the chief ministers of Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh , Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Odisha announced the decision to provide job reservations to Agniveers in the state jobs while backing the scheme.Underscoring the importance of national security, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath criticised the opposition on Friday for allegedly misleading the public regarding the Agniveer scheme.He also stated that his government will provide Agniveers jobs in police service and Pradeshik Armed Constabulary (PAC) on ""priority basis"".In a post on X, CM Yogi said, ""When Agniveers return after their service, Uttar Pradesh government will provide these youth the facility of adjustment in Police Service, PAC on priority basis. A certain reservation facility will be provided for them in Uttar Pradesh Police.""The announcement comes just days after the BJP-led Haryana government said the state would provide 10% reservation to Agniveers in direct recruitment to posts of constable, mining guard, forest guard, jail warden and SPO.Besides UP, Madhya Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Chhattisgarh also announced job quotas for Agniveers on Friday.Madhya Praadesh chief minister Mohan Yadav on Friday announced that his government will provide reservations to Agniveers in the recruitment of police and armed forces after the end of their services.Sharing the information on social media platform X, Yadav said the decision is as per ""the wishes of our illustrious Prime Minister Shri @narendramodi ji.""The Madhya Pradesh CM earlier in the morning paid tribute to the heroes of the Kargil war at Shaurya Smarak in Bhopal on the occasion of 25th anniversary of Kargil Vijay Diwas.With this, Madhya Pradesh became the third BJP-led state to announce reservation in jobs for Agniveers.On the occasion of Kargil Diwas, Uttarakhand CM Pushkar Singh Dhami also announced a similar decision.""We will make provisions and bring an Act to give reservation to them in government services. We are working on this plan. We will make use of their skills and discipline in various government departments,"" Dhami said.The chief minister also announced that the aid extended to the kin of martyrs will be increased from Rs 10 lakh to Rs 50 lakh.""No sacrifice can be bigger than the act of laying down one's life to secure the country's borders. No grant or honour can be enough for this supreme sacrifice,"" he added.Chhattisgarh CM Vishnu Deo Sai also made the announcement saying, ""I am glad to announce that ex-Agniveers will be given priority in appointment of police constable, forest guard and jail guard in Chhattisgarh. The state government will soon release guidelines for it.""Odisha CM Mohan Charan Majhi announced similar move and said 10 per cent quota and five-year age relaxation will be given to the Agniveers in uniform services.Nayab Saini-led Haryana government had announced the similar move on July 17.Chief minister Nayab Saini said the state government will provide 10 percent reservation to Agniveers in Haryana in direct recruitment to the posts of constable, mining guard, forest guard, jail warden and SPO.He also announced age waiver of three years for Agniveers in Group B, C employment in the state.Earlier today, in his address at the Kargil Vijay Diwas Shradhanjali Samaroh in Drass, PM Modi called Agnipath scheme an example of necessary reforms done by the army.He said some people were playing politics over a sensitive issue related to national security and rubbished claims that the Agnipath scheme was launched to save pension money. ""The aim of Agnipath is to make the forces young ... The aim of Agnipath is to keep the armies continuously fit for war,"" he said.""For decades, there have been discussions on making the armed forces young, from Parliament to various committees. The average age of Indian soldiers being higher than the global average has been raising concerns. Therefore, this topic was raised in many committees for years. But the will to solve this challenge related to the country's security was not shown earlier,"" PM Modi said.""Unfortunately, such a sensitive issue related to national security has been made a subject of politics by some people. Some people are playing politics of lies for their personal interests even on this reform of the army,"" the PM added.Modi government's Agniveer scheme has attracted constant criticism by the opposition making it one of the major flashpoint during Lok Sabha election campaign and subsequent Parliament sessions.As PM Modi on Friday blamed the opposition for ""playing politics of lies for their personal interests even on this reform of the army"" over the scheme, the INDIA bloc leaders launched a counter-attack, accusing PM Modi of being involved in ""petty politics"".Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge and other party leaders accused the prime minister of indulging in ""petty politics"" over the Agnipath issue and said the prime minister's remarks that his government implemented the scheme at the behest of the Army was a ""blatant lie"".""It is very unfortunate and deplorable that Prime Minister Narendra Modi ji is doing petty politics even on occasions like paying tribute to martyrs on Kargil Vijay Diwas. No Prime Minister has ever done this before,"" Kharge said.""Modi ji is saying that his government implemented the Agnipath scheme at the behest of the Army. This is a blatant lie and an unforgivable insult to our valiant armed forces. Modi ji, it is you who is spreading lies!"" he said in a post on X.Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh accused Modi of ""lying"" even on Kargil Vijay Diwas.""He (Modi) says the Agnipath/Agniveer scheme was introduced by the Army. General MM Naravane, who was Army chief at that time, has written that the scheme came as a complete surprise to the Army and as a 'bolt from the blue' to the Navy and Air Force. Modi is now trying to evade responsibility for this disastrous scheme,"" he said in a post on X.Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) MP Mahua Maji said the scheme needs to be reviewed as it does not provide any social security to the Agniveers.""I salute the martyrs of Kargil. Whenever foreign nations have attacked us, our brave soldiers have sacrificed their lives,"" she said.""But there should be a review of the Agniveer scheme. We should think about the soldiers on whom the whole nation of 140 crore people relies. What would happen to them after four years when they become unemployed?"" the JMM MP posed.The Trinamool Congress' Rajya Sabha MP Dola Sen dismissed the prime minister's remarks that the Agniveer scheme is intended to keep the force young.""The Army has always been young, perhaps the prime minister does not know... They get voluntary retirement while they are young. They serve the nation, we respect them,"" she said.""Being in the Army was a full-time job. But the Agnipath-Agniveer (scheme) ended that. We will keep protesting against the scheme,"" Sen said.","BJP-ruled states move to provide job reservations to the ex-servicemen. Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Odisha announced the decision.

"Two of 17 NEET toppers from Delhi, 4 from Rajasthan",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/two-of-17-neet-toppers-from-delhi-4-from-rajsthan/articleshow/112050801.cms,"NEW DELHI: A change of mere five marks has brought cheer for many and caused heartbreak for others as there are candidates who have moved up or down by 8,000 ranks in NEET-UG for medical school admissions.As exclusively reported by TOI on Friday, 17 candidates with perfect 720 marks were declared toppers, against 61 when NTA released the merit list following SC’s order.Leading the pack of 17 toppers with a perfect score of 720 is Delhi’s Mridul Manya Anand, followed by UP’s Ayush Naugraiya from EWS category. With multiple candidates getting perfect scores, NTA uses a tiebreaker system to rank them.While there was another Delhi candidate who scored 720, Rajasthan had four toppers, the highest.There was also a huge sigh of relief from other examinees for whom there was a marginal difference in ranks. Along with the decrease in the number of toppers, in the revised results, the qualifying cutoffs and number of qualified candidates have also come down. The revised results were declared Friday following a directive from Supreme Court after considering marks of a physics question, as there were two correct answers to a question.Apart from 17 with the perfect 720, there were six who scored 716, and 77 with 715 marks, which forms the cohort of top 100 candidates.The revision of results also brought down the qualifying cutoffs — for the unreserved and economically weaker section the new cutoff range is 720-162, down from 164, while for OBC/SC/ST it is 161-127.With four girls scoring 720, the share of female toppers went up from 16% to 23%, and there were 22 among the top 100.The list of toppers comprises four candidates from Rajasthan, three from Maharashtra, two each from Delhi and UP, and one each from Kerala, Chandigarh, Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Bihar and West Bengal.Forty-four of the 67 candidates who were earlier declared toppers had scored full marks because of the marks awarded for that particular physics question. The number of toppers was later reduced to 61 with NTA withdrawing grace marks awarded to six candidates to make up for loss of time at a few exam centres.The total number of qualified candidates dropped by 415 to 13,15,853. There are 15 states and UTs which registered an increase in the number of qualified candidates, including Goa, Gujarat, Kerala, Uttarakhand and West Bengal.Although NTA has not revealed the number of candidates who had earlier qualified (as per June 4 results) but are now short of the qualifying marks due to the loss of five marks, sources said, “the number is significant”.Even though the number of qualifiers decreased marginally, UP has the maximum with over 1.6 lakh making the cut, followed by Maharashtra (1.4 lakh) and Rajasthan (1.2 lakh). The other two states with over 85,000 qualifiers are Karnataka (88,887) and Kerala (86,713).Category-wise, the number of qualifiers decreased for unreserved, EWS and OBC, while it increased for SC and ST.Sharing his results and relief, a candidate said on social media, “656 se 651. Rank 26,119. Rank me zyada difference nahin (from 656 to 651 score. Not much difference in rank),” while another said, “2,000 rank pani me gayi chapak chapak (2,000 rank lost)”.On Tuesday, SC had dismissed pleas seeking cancellation and re-test of the controversy-ridden exam, holding that there was no evidence on record to conclude that it was “vitiated” on account of any “systemic breach” of its sanctity.CBI is probing alleged irregularities in NEET-UG and has lodged six FIRs.NEET-UG is conducted by NTA for admissions to MBBS, BDS, Ayush and other related courses in govt and private institutions.","The revised results were declared Friday following a directive from Supreme Court after considering marks of a physics question.

However, the special court judge rejected the Central Bureau of Investigation's application on Friday, saying the court cannot review his own order of rejection of custody of the accused. Granting permission to arrest the accused would be reviewing the earlier order, the court said.The CBI, in its plea, had said it needs to interrogate Varma to unearth his role with Mehul Choksi in availment of 142 buyers' credit amounting to Rs 3,011 crore disbursed against 165 unauthorised Letters of Undertaking (LOUs). However, the accused, through his lawyer, contended that he was made as accused in the supplementary chargesheet in 2021. When he left India in May 2017, there was no chargesheet against him. Therefore he cannot be said to have evaded criminal proceedings, his lawyer submitted.Choksi has been living in Antigua since 2018, after escaping from India, weeks before the scam was reported. The diamantaire and his nephew, Nirav Modi , allegedly siphoned off over Rs 13,000 crore of public money from the PNB using LoUs and foreign letters of credit (FLCs) by bribing officials of the bank's Brady House branch in Mumbai.","Varma, a former international business head of Mehul Choksi's Gitanjali Group, appeared before the court last week.

His remarks come as a counter to the charges of Congress members Randeep Surjewala and Jairam Ramesh in the House.Chouhan even cited various responses of the then ministers - Sharad Pawar, Kantilal Bhuria and K V Thomas - of UPA-I & II regimes and claimed that all of them had rejected the higher MSP that was recommended by the Swaminathan commission on one or the other ground.""We have given twice the MSP rates as compared to when Surjewala's (Congress-led UPA) govt was in office,"" said Chouhan amid sloganeering by opposition members.

PM Surya Laxmi Yojna: Free 3KW Solar Rooftop Installation in Madhya Pradesh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/pay-nothing-to-set-up-a-3-kw-solar-rooftop-plant-in-madhya-pradesh/articleshow/112003038.cms,"The estimated cost of a 3KW solar rooftop plant as per Union govt specifications is Rs 1,65,000.

BHOPAL: Can you set up a solar rooftop plant without paying any money? Yes, the Madhya Pradesh govt is coming up with a new ambitious scheme named ""PM Surya Laxmi Yojna"" that encourages more than 1 crore power consumers to install solar rooftop plants without incurring any cost.This will reduce the electricity subsidy provided by state govt month-on-month and help the power distribution companies (discoms) to meet clean energy requirement.The scheme proposes that the Union govt under its solar rooftop policy provides subsidies to the tune of 60% of the cost of the plant while the state aims to provide 10% of the remaining 40% amount as margin money to the banks upfront and get the balance amount financed at 7% interest.Thus, the consumer will not be burdened to pay additional money for installing the solar rooftop plant and the financed amount can be paid back to the bank by selling off surplus energy generated each month.It's a win-win situation for the state govt and power distribution companies (discoms) that are burdened with power subsidies and the consumers.According to state govt estimates there are a total of 1.26 crore domestic consumers in Madhya Pradesh. Of these, 1.08 crore consumers are beneficiaries of the Atal Griha Jyoti Yojana, i.e., their consumption is less than 150 units of electricity per month, and they are subsidized at the rate of Rs 568 per month by the state govt. And among these 1.08 crore consumers, 62.7 lakh consumers are those who consume between 100 and 150 units of electricity per month. They are the target of the new scheme.As of now, after state govt subsidy, these 1.08 crore consumers pay between Rs 100 and Rs 408 per month to the respective discoms. But after installing solar rooftop plants at the current tariff they will be required to pay only Rs 36 to Rs 183 per month.Under the proposed scheme of the MP govt, the estimated cost of a 3KW solar rooftop plant as per Union govt specifications is Rs 1,65,000. Of this, GoI provides a subsidy of 60% i.e. Rs 99,000 and the state would provide the banks a margin money of 10% i.e. 16,500. The remaining 30% i.e. Rs 49,500 would be financed by the banks at 7% interest.""The consumers will get a solar rooftop at zero investment-they will get lower bills and once the bank instalments are paid, they will also earn some extra income by selling surplus power,"" said a top official.""On the other hand, as on date, the MP govt spends more than Rs 5,500 crore annually only for the subsidy on Atal Griha Jyoti Yojana. After installation of RTS plants under proposed Surya Laxmi scheme, the state govt will only have to pay the subsidy once, which is a maximum of Rs 16,500 per consumer. Besides, the govt and consumers, the discoms stand to gain as they will get the benefit of purchasing power at lower rates and selling it at a higher rate. It will provide the benefits of decentralized generation,"" energy department sources said.""Under the proposed scheme, only those consumers who are beneficiaries of the Atal Griha Jyoti Yojana will be eligible for the margin money subsidy by the state govt. For all other consumers only the subsidy provided by the central govt will be available. In the first phase 1,00,000 such rooftop installations will be targeted,"" said sources.","The Madhya Pradesh govt is coming up with a new ambitious scheme named ""PM Surya Laxmi Yojna"" The state aims to provide 10% of the remaining 40% amount as margin money to the banks upfront. This will reduce the electricity subsidy provided by state govt month-on-month.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112003152,imgsize-1678420,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/112003152.jpg"

GURGAON: Faridabad was Haryana 's most polluted city and the second-most polluted city in India in the first half of 2024, according to a study by Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air ( CREA ).The city's air quality was assessed based on PM 2.5 concentrations, which averaged at 103 g/m³.Gurgaon was the fourth-most polluted city in the country in the same period, its average PM2.5 at 99 g/m³.These findings underscore the critical risk to health that air pollution poses in NCR. The top 5 most polluted cities are Byrnihat (Meghalaya), Faridabad, Delhi, Gurgaon and Bhagalpur (Bihar).The CREA report presents a dismal scenario, revealing that Faridabad surpassed the World Health Organization's (WHO) daily PM2.5 guideline of 15 g/m³ on every day between Jan and June this year.Moreover, it exceeded the daily limit under the National Ambient Air Quality Standards ( NAAQS ) of 60 g/m³ on a staggering 164 out of 182 days.Faridabad is the sole non-attainment city in Haryana under the country's National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), as its air quality didn't meet the national ambient air quality standards between 2011 and 2015.NCAP was launched in 2019. A total of 131 cities are covered under this programme.The situation in neighbouring Gurgaon and Ballabgarh is not much better either. While Gurgaon's average PM2.5 concentration was the fourth-highest in India in the last six months, Ballabgarh was ninth on the list at 94 g/m³.Both cities reported PM2.5 levels above the NAAQS limit for over 160 days during this period. These findings underscore a critical environmental health issue in Haryana, with air pollution levels consistently breaching safe standards, posing a significant risk to public health and necessitating urgent action.Other cities on the most polluted list were Bhagalpur (5th-most polluted), Sri Ganganagar (6), Greater Noida (7), Muzaffarnagar (8), Ballabgarh (9), Bhiwadi (10), Hanumangarh (11), Chhapra (12), Patna (13), Mandi Gobindgarh (14), Angul (15), Noida (16), Muzaffarpur (17), Saharsa (18), Asansol (19), and Rohtak (20).Sunil Dahiya, analyst at CREA, said: ""As many as 21 of the 24 Haryana cities that were included in the study, except Palwal, Ambala and Mandikhera, exceeded the NAAQS PM2.5 limit for most of this period. The authorities need to focus on two areas. First, the data quality and placement of ambient air quality monitors for these three cities should be investigated, as it is peculiar that some cities are showing unusually low values in the area's polluted airshed, which raises questions on the data recorded by these cities. Second, it is crucial to formulate a larger airshed-level clean air action plan, which also enforces systematic and comprehensive pollution strategies for these cities and addresses sources beyond the municipal corporation boundaries of these cities.""Officials from the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) said Faridabad's air quality has improved compared to past years. Between Oct 2021 and Sept 2022, the average PM2.5 level was 101.5 g/m³, which improved to 89 g/m³ in Oct 2022-Sept 2023, a senior official said.""This represents a 12% dip, indicating an improvement in air quality compared to previous years. There has been a reduction in pollutants, but it is true that the condition has not changed completely. Coal-based industries have been shifted out of Faridabad, and many have converted to PNG. Road infrastructure has also improved in the last three years, and awareness about pollution has also increased. But we still have miles to go. We are working towards achieving clean air,"" the official said.The NCAP initially set a target of reducing PM2.5 and PM10 in the selected cities by 20%-30% by 2024, taking the pollution levels in 2017 as the base year to improve upon.In Sept 2022, the Centre set a new target of a 40% reduction in PM2.5 concentration compared to 2017 in cities covered under NCAP by 2026. To meet these targets, it has released around Rs 6,897 crore to these cities.PM2.5 refers to air particles that are 2.5 microns in diameter, which is approximately 1/30th the width of a strand of human hair.It comprises fine, toxic particles that can penetrate deep into the lungs, enter the bloodstream, and cause heart disease, stroke, and other respiratory ailments. PM2.5 data is a widely employed measure for assessing the impacts of air pollution on health.","Faridabad was Haryana's most polluted city and the second-most polluted city in India in the first half of 2024.

Their companies, Tesla and Meta, have had heightened tensions, particularly after Meta launched Threads, a text-based conversation app, in July 2023. This led X to send a cease-and-desist letter to Meta, accusing it of using Twitter’s trade secrets and other intellectual property improperly.Interestingly, Musk’s challenge came just a day after he praised Zuckerberg for Meta’s new AI model, Llama 3.1. This model, which Meta claims is superior to OpenAI’s GPT-4, is open-source and available for public use.

NEW DELHI: The Allahabad high court has granted bail to Ravindra Singh Rathaur , a man accused of raping a woman by allegedly rendering her unconscious with chloroform . Justice Krishan Pahal , leaning on medical expertise, cited that it is highly improbable for an inexperienced person to manage to anesthetize a sleeping individual without causing disturbance.The court emphasized the principle of ‘ Presumption of Innocence Unless Proven Guilty ,’ referencing a Supreme Court decision.“The story often published in the lay press of a woman having been rendered suddenly unconscious by a handkerchief soaked in chloroform held over her face and then raped is not to be believed,” the court stated.Justice Pahal further referenced JP Modi's Medical Jurisprudence & Toxicology, stating that it is “impossible to anesthetize a woman against her will while she is awake.”Rathaur was accused of establishing a physical relationship with the complainant after falsely marrying her in 2022. It was later revealed that he had hidden the fact of having two children from a previous marriage.The complainant alleged Rathaur rendered her unconscious using chloroform and recorded videos of her private moments.

:

Nearly 40 metal roof sheets at the Panaji municipal market were blown away due to gusty winds on Thursday night. Rain water also entered several shops and vendors said that they have suffered losses.Mayor Rohit Monserrate visited the market complex on Friday to assess the damage. “The Corporation of the City of Panaji ( CCP ) will temporarily install new roof sheets to ensure that vendors and visitors don’t face any inconvenience,” he said.Monserrate said that a tender would be floated for refurbishing the complex, including the roof as a long-term solution. “CCP has decided to refurbish the market at an estimated cost of Rs 2 crore. We had tried to engage other departments for the project but there was no positive response from them. So, CCP will handle it independently by securing council approval and initiating the tender process,” he added.The mayor also said that the civic body has been facing significant financial challenges due to a lack of revenue generation from market tenants .

"Muslim Leadership Summit to discuss reservation, other issues facing the community",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/muslim-leadership-summit-to-discuss-reservation-other-issues-facing-the-community/articleshow/112048323.cms,"Muslim Welfare Association founder Saleem Sarang (right) with MP Maulana Mohibulllah Nadvi

MUMBAI: Being brought together for The Muslim Leadership Summit 2024 next week in Mumbai, a group of intellectuals, scholars and law-makers from the community will discuss threadbare Muslim reservation and other issues facing the community. Around two dozen Muslim MPs, besides scholars and activists, are expected to participate in the Summit.The Muslim Leadership Summit 2024 is being hosted by the initiative called Muslim Welfare Association founded by activist and political leader Saleem Sarang.“This significant event will serve as a platform for comprehensive discussions on critical issues affecting the Muslim community, including welfare, reservation, safety, and security,” said Muslim Welfare Association founder Saleem Sarang.Noted Islamic scholar Khalil-ur-Rahman Sajjad Nomani who is also an important functionary of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board will also participate and guide the community with his talk.""We are bringing together Muslim lawmakers from across the country,” said Sarang. Sarang added that it is high time the Muslims got reservations not only in education and jobs but they deserve political reservation too.The summit aims to foster dialogue and collaboration among Muslim leaders to address the issues facing the community.The event will feature a series of panel discussions, keynote addresses and interactive sessions, providing a unique opportunity for parliamentarians, scholars, community leaders and other stakeholders to engage in meaningful conversations. Several panel discussions have been planned, including on Muslim welfare and reservation.“We will also debate the current reservation policies and advocating for equitable representation of the community in various sectors. This is an important issue. As many as 75 percent of Muslim children aged six to 14 miss out on education within the first few years of school. Only two to three percent of children receive higher education. The proportion of Muslims below the poverty line is also high. This ratio is two to two and a half percent in government jobs as well as private jobs. Drug addiction and vulnerability to commit crimes are big issues.The root cause of all this is lack of education,” said Sarang.The Muslim Leadership Summit 2024 aspires to create a roadmap for the future, emphasizing unity, resilience, and progress. By bringing together influential Muslim leaders, the summit aims to amplify voices, foster understanding, and work towards a more inclusive and just society.A few weeks ago, Sarang had called on Maula Khalil-ur-Rahman Sajjad Nomani and had an engaging discussion.“During our meeting, we delved into two pressing issues: Muslim reservation and Muslim political representation. Maulana sahab emphasized that these issues are critical for the socio-economic and political advancement of the Muslim community. He stressed the importance of the community uniting and actively working towards securing their rightful place in society,” said Sarang.","The Muslim Leadership Summit 2024 is being hosted by the initiative called Muslim Welfare Association.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.",Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
Drugs: How US tricked and captured infamous Mexican drug lord 'El Mayo',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/how-us-tricked-and-captured-infamous-mexican-drug-lord-el-mayo/articleshow/112055236.cms,"A Narco thriller come to life



Betrayal by a close ally



A capture years in the making



Pleading not guilty



Contrasting styles



Implications and repercussions



Ismael ‘ El Mayo ’ Zambada, co-founder of the Sinaloa Cartel, and Joaquín Guzmán López, the son of the cartel's other co-founder, Joaquín ‘ El Chapo ’ Guzmán, were arrested in El Paso, Texas. The arrest of Ismael Zambada García, a major Sinaloa Cartel leader who had dodged authorities for years, unfolded unexpectedly at a small airport near El Paso, involving deception and betrayal according to the New York Times.They were arrested in Texas, US attorney General Merrick said, calling the cartel ""one of the most violent and powerful drug trafficking organizations in the world.""""Both men are facing multiple charges in the United States for leading the Cartel’s criminal operations, including its deadly fentanyl manufacturing and trafficking networks,"" he added.On Thursday evening, a Beechcraft King Air turboprop landed at a small municipal airport outside El Paso. Stepping off the plane was one of Mexico 's most wanted men: Ismael Zambada García, also known as El Mayo. For decades, he had successfully eluded capture by both Mexican and American officials, despite a $15 million US bounty on his head. Living a life of luxurious simplicity in the mountains of Sinaloa, he had managed to stay one step ahead—until now.The cross-border flight that led to his capture was orchestrated by an unlikely betrayer: Joaquín Guzmán López, the son of Zambada García's former partner in crime , Joaquín ""El Chapo"" Guzmán. According to US officials, Guzmán López tricked Zambada García into boarding the plane under the guise of inspecting real estate in northern Mexico. Unbeknownst to El Mayo, the plane was actually bound for Texas, where American agents were waiting.Joaquín Guzmán López’s betrayal came as a shock. He and his brothers had inherited their father’s faction of the cartel, and tensions had been simmering between them and Zambada García since El Chapo’s extradition to the US in 2017. The younger Guzmán's actions may have been motivated by a desire to secure a favourable deal for himself and his brother, Ovidio Guzmán López, who is already in US custody.For years, American law enforcement maintained a quiet back channel with Guzmán López, which increased in frequency after Ovidio's extradition to Chicago last September. This relationship eventually culminated in Guzmán López delivering Zambada García to the US, a significant coup for American prosecutors.The arrest of Zambada García marks one of the biggest blows to organised crime in recent years. It also raises numerous questions about the role of US law enforcement and the possible involvement of Mexican officials. Mexico's Secretary of Security, Rosa Icela Rodríguez, confirmed that the Mexican government played no role in the capture and only learned of the event when the US Embassy announced that Zambada García and Guzmán López were in custody.President Andrés Manuel López Obrador of Mexico demanded a full report from the US on the operation, stressing the need for respect between the two nations.At an initial court appearance in Texas on Friday, Zambada García, believed to be in his 70s and in a wheelchair, entered a plea of not guilty to drug conspiracy charges. He waived his right to be present at an arraignment next Wednesday, with his case overseen by US District Judge Kathleen Cardone.The Texas charges to which Zambada pleaded not guilty included continuing criminal enterprise, narcotics importation conspiracy, and money laundering.The indictment, filed in April 2012, alleges that under Zambada and El Chapo's leadership, cartel members kidnapped a Texas resident in 2009 over a lost marijuana shipment, and a US citizen with his family in 2010. Both were murdered, and their bodies were found in Juarez, Mexico, according to prosecutors.Both Zambada and Joaquin Guzman Lopez, a son of El Chapo, face multiple charges in the United States for funneling huge quantities of fentanyl and other drugs to US streets. Fentanyl overdoses have surged to become the leading cause of death for Americans between the ages of 18 and 45.The Sinaloa Cartel traffics drugs to over 50 countries and is one of Mexico's two most powerful crime groups, according to US authorities.Zambada and El Chapo's sons represent different generations within the cartel, each with their own style. Zambada is known as an ""old-school"" operator who stays out of the spotlight and works behind the scenes. In contrast, El Chapo's sons are more flamboyant, drawing attention as they rose through the cartel ranks. They are also seen as more violent and impulsive compared to Zambada’s calculated approach.The capture of Zambada García could have significant repercussions for the criminal landscape in Mexico. Experts predict potential internal conflict within the Sinaloa Cartel, possibly leading to increased violence as rival factions vie for control. The Mexican military has already deployed 200 Special Forces members to Culiacán, the cartel's stronghold, to maintain order.Moreover, Zambada García's cooperation with US authorities could expose corruption within Mexico, further straining relations between the two countries. While the arrests of key cartel figures might not immediately disrupt drug trafficking operations, they represent a substantial victory for US law enforcement in their ongoing battle against narcotics smuggling.In recent years, the Sinaloa Cartel has become a primary target for US authorities, accused of being the largest supplier of fentanyl to the US The cartel's influence extends globally, trafficking drugs to over 50 countries. The arrest of El Mayo Zambada, a ""godfather"" figure in the underworld, signals a critical moment in the fight against organised crime.","Ismael Zambada García, a major Sinaloa Cartel leader who had dodged authorities for years, was arrested in El Paso, Texas.

Passengers exact 'revenge' on Delta Airlines following flight delays,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/passengers-exact-revenge-on-delta-airlines-following-flight-delays-did-they-go-too-far/articleshow/112055015.cms,"People loading up on free food in airline’s VIP lounge.

“This is for the people,” said content creator Kyle Philippi in the comments. (TikTok / @kylephilippi)

In a dramatic act of protest , a pair of passengers took their frustration with Delta Airlines to a new level by raiding the airline’s VIP lounge after experiencing significant flight delays . Their bold antics, which included loading up on free food, emptying hand sanitizer dispensers, and more, have captured widespread attention online.A video documenting the escapade has garnered over 600,000 views on TikTok.Content creator Kyle Philippi, who posted the footage, captioned it, “POV: Delta doesn’t compensate for thousands of dollars lost from delaying our flights for days so we gonna get it back in the Sky Club. This will set them back.”The video’s timing seems to align with last week’s Microsoft outage, which led to Delta canceling thousands of flights and affecting approximately half a million passengers, according to the AP.The footage opens with Philippi and an accomplice filling their plates with an excessive array of complimentary food at Delta’s Sky Club lounge. They proceed to pour out bottles of wine, steal magazines, and squeeze all the hand sanitizer from its dispenser. The video concludes with Philippi running water in the lounge’s shower, without using it for bathing, and emptying the shampoo and soap onto the floor.Despite the clear act of defiance, the TikTok community has largely supported the duo’s actions. Comments praising Philippi and his partner have been abundant, with one user saying, “I won’t lie, pouring the wine out went hard.” Another praised, “This is the level of petty we strive for,” and a third added, “As a Sky Lounge connoisseur, I am humbled by your greatness.”Philippi responded to supporters, saying, “This is for the people,” reflecting the sentiments of those who feel wronged by the airline.The Post has reached out to Delta Airlines for a response. US regulators are currently investigating the reasons behind Delta’s prolonged recovery from the global outage, which has intensified scrutiny of the airline’s operational procedures.","A video documenting the escapade has garnered over 600,000 views on TikTok. “This is for the people,” said content creator Kyle Philippi in the comments.
