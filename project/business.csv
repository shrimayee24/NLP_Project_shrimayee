"Partition’s unanswered questions still haunt India, says Mani Shankar Aiyar after Pahalgam attack",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/partitions-unanswered-questions-still-haunt-india-says-mani-shankar-aiyar-after-pahalgam-attack/articleshow/120659292.cms,"(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Veteran Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar questioned whether the unresolved legacy of Partition is reflected in the horrific tragedy that unfolded in Pahalgam. Speaking at a book launch event at the India International Centre in New Delhi, Aiyar said the fundamental question posed to India during Partition still remains unanswered.""Many people almost prevented Partition, but it happened because there were differences in value systems and assessments of the nature of India's nationhood and its civilisational inheritance between people like Gandhi, Pandit Nehru, Jinnah and many other Muslims who did not agree with Mr Jinnah,"" he said.""But in today's India, does a Muslim feel that he is accepted? Does a Muslim feel that he is cherished? Does a Muslim feel that he is celebrated? Why should I answer my own questions? Ask any Muslim and you will get the answers,"" he added.""But the fact is that the Partition happened and till today we are living with the consequences of that Partition. Is this how we should be living? Is that the unresolved questions of the Partition reflected in the terrible tragedy... in Pahalgam on April 22,"" Aiyar added.Reflecting on history, Aiyar recalled that Pakistan's ambition of being the homeland and protector of Muslims in the subcontinent collapsed after the 1971 war, when Bangladesh broke away to assert its Bengali identity over a purely religious one.""It was the failure to understand that every salvation has more than one dimension to this identity that was responsible for what happened to Pakistan in 1971,"" he said.Aiyar further added that the questions India faced then pre-Partition and one that continues to resonate today is what should be done with what were around 100 million Muslims at the time, and nearly 200 million now.""Do we accept Jinnah's view and say 'no, they are a separate nation living amongst us as saboteurs or potential saboteurs', or do we look at them and say 'they are part and parcel of us'? Do we define ourselves as a composite or do we say 'no, we have only one dimension in our identity and that is the religious dimension of Hinduism'?""On April 22, terrorists attacked tourists at Baisaran meadow in Pahalgam, south Kashmir, killing 26 people, including a Nepali national. It was the deadliest assault in the region since the 2019 Pulwama attack. In the aftermath, the government vowed severe punishment for the perpetrators, while also launching major crackdowns on terrorist networks across Jammu and Kashmir.","Mani Shankar Aiyar questioned whether the unresolved legacy of Partition is reflected in the horrific tragedy that unfolded in Pahalgam.

A sweeping crackdown across Gujarat has led to the detention of over 550 Bangladeshi immigrants living illegally in Gujarat, with the majority more than 100 individuals apprehended in Surat during an overnight operation, authorities said on Saturday, PTI reported.Led by Gujarat Police in collaboration with the Special Operations Group (SOG), Crime Branch, Anti-Human Trafficking Unit (AHTU), and local police units, the coordinated raids also covered Ahmedabad, where over 450 suspected illegal immigrants were detained in the early hours of the morning. Officials confirmed that those detained had entered India without valid documentation and were living in the country using forged papers.Deputy Commissioner of Police (SOG) Rajdeep Singh Nakum stated that the Surat detentions followed intelligence inputs and that the individuals would be deported following verification and interrogation. “They had entered India illegally and were living with forged documents. After the investigation, they will be deported to Bangladesh,” he said.In Ahmedabad, the operation began at around 3 a.m. and was executed by teams from multiple wings including the Economic Offences Wing and Zone 6. According to DCP Ajit Rajian, more than 400 people were taken into custody from the Chandola area, a locality flagged in recent intelligence reports for harbouring undocumented immigrants.Sharad Singhal, Joint Commissioner of Police (Crime Branch), said that the drive was carried out under direct orders from the Home Minister, Commissioner of Police, and Director General of Police. He noted that prior to this operation, two FIRs had been filed since April 2024, leading to the arrest of 127 Bangladeshis and the deportation of 77.The Gujarat crackdown follows a wider national pattern, with Delhi Police simultaneously launching its own probe into illegal immigration networks facilitating the entry and settlement of Bangladeshi and Rohingya nationals. Six FIRs have been registered in the capital, and Special Investigation Teams are now looking into what has been described internally as a ""mother conspiracy"" involving agents creating forged Indian identity documents and arranging housing and employment.In recent weeks, multiple arrests have been made in Delhi, including individuals who had been residing in the city for decades under fake identities.

NEW DELHI: Citing past incidents - Kargil War, 26/11 attack and Kandahar hijacking - where media coverage severely impacted security operations , Centre on Saturday issued a strong advisory to media outlets, urging them to refrain from live coverage of defence operations and troop movements. With tensions escalating following the Pahalgam attack , I&B ministry's advisory warned that real-time reporting could ""inadvertently assist hostile elements"" & endanger national security . tnnThe Union government said: ""In the interest of national security, all media platforms, news agencies, and social media users are advised to exercise utmost responsibility and adhere strictly to existing laws and regulations while reporting on matters concerning defence and other security-related operations.""Government specifically barred ""real-time coverage, dissemination of visuals, or reporting based on 'sources-based' information related to defence operations or movement"", emphasising that premature disclosure of sensitive details could compromise operational success and put personnel at risk.Saturday's advisory signals growing concern over the fast-paced, unregulated flow of information in the current media ecosystem - especially on digital and social media platforms, where battlefield visuals and operational updates often surface before official confirmations.According to senior officials, there are several legal provisions which already regulate sensitive reporting, including the Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act and provisions under the Disaster Management Act and ""the advisory subtly warned that violations could attract action"".Security experts say the move was inevitable after images, videos and speculative reports flooded news channels and social media following the Pahalgam attack, with some inadvertently revealing movement of reinforcements and counter-terror preparations.Though the advisory stops short of imposing a complete ban on defence reporting, it underlines that the media must balance public interest with operational sensitivity. ""Utmost responsibility"" is the key, govt said, in an atmosphere where any careless dissemination could be weaponised by adversaries.","Citing past incidents - Kargil War, 26/11 attack and Kandahar hijacking - where media coverage severely impacted security operations.

PANAJI: A day after the enforcement directorate (ED) seized property documents worth Rs 600 crore from the offices and residence of 'key mastermind' Rohan Harmalkar , it seized his house.

"FIITJEE siphoned off Rs 250 crore, failed to deliver quality educational services: ED",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/fiit-jee-siphoned-off-rs-250-crore-failed-to-deliver-quality-educational-services-ed/articleshow/120659232.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Enforcement Directorate has added a new dimension to its actions — its recent searches on FIITJEE were prompted not just by financial irregularities, but also by the institute’s failure to deliver “quality educational services” promised to students.The anti-money laundering agency has always been confined to probing financial frauds, tracking money trail of proceeds of crime and attachment of assets. But, of late, it has shifted its focus to immediate restitution of attached assets: be it to banks or individuals who have been scammed by fraudsters.As an outcome of its searches earlier this week, ED on Saturday said the probe revealed FIITJEE collected Rs 250 crore from 15,000 students and siphoned off the proceeds in buying personal properties by di rectors and other top executives of the coaching company.At least 32 coaching centres at Ghaziabad, Lucknow, Meerut, Noida, Prayagraj, Delhi, Bhopal, Gwalior, Indore Faridabad, Gurugram, Mumbai etc were abruptly shut down, causing widespread distress leading to several FIRs registered by police in several states.“These funds were diverted for personal and unauthorized use, while faculty salaries remained unpaid,” ED said. On April 24, ED conducted searches at seven locations in Noida, Delhi and Gurgaon in the case of FIITJEE fraud.The ED said it initiated investigation against FIIT-JEE and its senior management as FIRs alleged that the “senior management collected substantial fees from students and parents under the pretext of providing quality educational services , but instead engaged in large-scale financial fraud and criminal breach of trust.”","The probe revealed FIITJEE collected Rs 250 crore from 15,000 students.

India’s sudden Jhelum water release sparks panic in PoK,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/indias-sudden-jhelum-water-release-sparks-panic-in-pok/articleshow/120652831.cms,"Water came rushing in, we're struggling to protect lives and property: POK resident



ISLAMABAD: A sudden surge in the Jhelum river’s water level has thrown Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) into chaos, as India, local authorities claimed, released water from the Uri Dam without prior warning on Saturday.The abrupt discharge triggered a water emergency in PoK’s Hattian Bala district, forcing residents along the riverbanks to flee to safer ground.The move escalated tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbours, with Pakistani authorities condemning it as a violation of international norms and the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT). India suspended the IWT on April 23 citing the terror attack in Pahalgam in which 26 people were killed by terrorists.Local officials in Muzaffarabad, PoK’s capital, and Chakoti sounded alarms through loudspeakers, urging communities to evacuate as water levels rose rapidly. “We had no warning. The water came rushing in, and we’re struggling to protect lives and property,” said Muhammad Asif, a resident of Dumel, a village on the riverbank in PoK.A district government official in Muzaffarabad issued a brief statement advising citizens to stay away from locations close to the Jhelum river. “Due to India releasing more water than usual into the Jhelum river, there is moderate flooding,” added the spokesperson.Moderate flooding has been reported in low-lying regions of Kohala and Dhalkot, with unconfirmed reports of livestock losses and damage to crops.The PoK govt has accused India of deliberate “water terrorism”, pointing to the lack of prior notification as a breach of the IWT, a 1960 agreement brokered by the World Bank to regulate shared river waters. The treaty mandates that both nations share information on water releases to prevent downstream harm.In PoK, officials said, the immediate focus remains on protecting residents. The Hattian Bala administration has set up temporary shelters and mobilised rescue teams. “We’re doing all we can, but the scale of this crisis is overwhelming,” said district commissioner Bilal Ahmed.Authorities have also urged residents to avoid riverbanks and refrain from fishing or grazing livestock near the water. Across the border, India officials have remained tight-lipped, neither confirming nor denying the release. Some Indian media outlets, however, claim the discharge was a routine dam operation necessitated by heavy rainfall in Jammu and Kashmir.","A sudden surge in the Jhelum river’s water level has thrown Pakistan-occupied Kashmir into chaos.

De-weeding operation at Bengaluru’s Madiwala Lake throws up refrigerator,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/de-weeding-operation-at-bengalurus-madiwala-lake-throws-up-refrigerator/articleshow/120652381.cms,"BENGALURU: In a bizarre discovery, a double-door refrigerator was fished out of Madiwala Lake during a de-weeding operation Friday evening. A Jaldost team, operating under the banner of National Aerospace Laboratories (NAL), stumbled upon the unexpected ‘catch' while clearing overgrown water weeds.The refrigerator wasn't alone in its watery grave. Among the other items retrieved were heaps of plastic bags, milk packets, mugs, books, pens, and even steel vessels, turning the lake into what locals call a ‘miniature junkyard'.While the Jaldost — the de-weeding machine — is adept at removing weeds and debris from water, NAL officials and residents pointed out that the responsibility of waste disposal lies with Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP). ""Each scoop can lift objects as tall as 6-7ft and weighing up to 3-4 tonnes,"" said T Karthikeyan, senior principal scientist at NAL. ""So far, we've pulled over 20 tonnes of waste, the majority of which was hyacinth and garbage. This includes all sorts of waste from metal to plastic to a refrigerator. We're now wondering what all we might get when we completely clear the lake.""Elaborating on finding the refrigerator, Karthikeyan added, ""While our operators were de-weeding a small part of the lake, as the Jaldost machine went inside and started to clean, it hit a hard rock-like structure. On slowly trying to lift it, the operator realised it was heavy. When he pulled it out, he realised there was a refrigerator with loads of weeds and silt inside it.""Lack of clear planOnce the de-weeding is done and waste lifted, the Jaldost operator dumps it near the lake and into trucks, and BBMP needs to discard it appropriately. ""The extracted biomass can be put to good use — processed into paper, cardboard, handwoven products, or even biofuels. However, without a clear plan for handling the massive volumes of waste, the opportunity is being wasted,"" Karthikeyan told TOI.So far, BBMP has shown little urgency in clearing the growing piles of weeds and garbage collected at the lake's edges. Locals, meanwhile, are left grappling with the aftermath of decades of neglect. ""If refrigerators and steel vessels are emerging from the lake, one can only imagine what lies beneath,"" said Nithin Shetty, a resident of BTM Layout and frequent visitor to Madiwala Lake.Another resident, Naveen Reddy, said, ""BBMP has been ignorant about this lake for quite a while. They should first monitor the lake and penalise everyone dumping waste in it. We might find a sofa set soon in this lake. BBMP should be penalised for this.""When asked about waste segregation, Bangalore Solid Waste Management Ltd (BSWML) officials the garbage is being collected but they haven't segregated it. ""There is too much waste to be segregated,"" an official said.HOW JALDOST CAME ABOUTThe de-weeding work at Madiwala Lake is being carried out using Jaldost Mark 2 , a machine developed by NAL as a spin-off from aerospace technology. Built with lightweight materials and controlled by hydraulic systems similar to those used in aircraft, it is designed to tackle heavy biomass loads. Sources explained the machine can operate in lakes with a depth of up to 30ft, thought a minimum of 2ft is needed for effective use.The Jaldost project was initiated in 2020 after BBMP approached NAL with specifications for a de-weeding solution. Following extensive testing, the machine was launched in 2023 across various lakes. Its first official deployment was at Gottigere Lake, where it successfully cleared 35 acres of hyacinth in just a month. Impressed by the results, BBMP deployed the machine at Madiwala Lake last week.","A double-door refrigerator was fished out of Madiwala Lake during a de-weeding operation Friday evening.

Cars24 lays off 200 employees: Read what CEO Vikram Chopra said,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/cars24-lays-off-200-employees-read-what-ceo-vikram-chopra-said/articleshow/120659645.cms,"What Cars24 CEO Vikram Chopra said about job cuts

A tough moment and the road ahead

Autonauts,

This is a hard message to write.

Over the past few weeks, we have had to make the difficult decision to part ways with around 200 of our teammates across various functions. Every person impacted gave this company their time, energy, and belief. That matters deeply, and we are genuinely grateful.

This is not about how hard someone worked. This is about the bets we placed and where we got it wrong.

More than performance, this is about structure.

We’ve always believed in moving fast. We’ve always pushed to build big. But the hard truth is: speed without enough clarity is expensive. And when the math doesn’t add up, it is on us to reset.

Over the last few months, we realised that some projects did not deliver what we expected. Some roles were added too early. A few hypotheses simply didn’t hold when tested. And in some cases, we couldn’t offer the kind of growth or learning that people truly deserve.

It is easy to blame the market or external factors. But the responsibility is ours. When the plan doesn’t work, you don’t blame the players, you take responsibility, and change the plan.

Yes, we made mistakes.

I wish we hadn’t, but when you're building something hard, failures are part of the journey. The most challenging part is when those failures affect our teammates. That’s not easy to accept.

But I truly believe this: CARS24 and our Autonauts get stronger with every experience. Tough times don’t last. Tough people do.

So we are course-correcting now. Fewer things, done better. That’s the shift. It may sound obvious, but when you’re in motion constantly, it’s easy to lose balance.

The exercise is now behind us.

From here, we focus entirely on rebuilding stronger, with clarity and care.

You are not alone. We are here to help you land on your feet, and to walk with you through this transition.

To those impacted: We’re here for you, offering severance support, resume and LinkedIn assistance, mentorship, emotional wellness resources, and access to open roles within our network. Your managers and people team have already reached out to you. We are here for you, not just in words, but in action. Our first priority is to ensure the smoothest possible transition for you and your families. If you are facing financial hardship, whether due to medical issues, family emergencies, or any other reason, please know you are not alone. That’s why we have created a Compassion Fund: a way to stand by those who need extra support right now. We will look at every case with care, dignity, and urgency, and do our very best to provide help where it is needed most. This is our commitment to be there for our Autonauts in the moments that matter most. Even if you don’t need financial help, please know: we are still here for you in every way we can be. You are, and will always be, part of the Autonaut family.

To those still here: I know this shakes confidence. Please don’t hold back. Speak your mind. Share what’s heavy. Let’s walk through this together. I’ll do my best to answer every question.

Wherever people go from here, I hope one thing stays true: That we each get to do work that pushes us, grows us, and matters.

Today, more than ever, our values are not abstract words, they are practices.

Let’s keep building that kind of company together.

– Vikram

Cars24, a leading e-commerce platform for pre-owned vehicles, has laid off nearly 200 employees across various departments as part of a strategic restructuring exercise. The company clarified that the decision was not driven by cost-cutting but aimed at aligning its team and structure with long-term goals. In a blog post titled “A Tough Moment and the Road Ahead,” Cars24 CEO Vikram Chopra described the layoffs as a “specific, intentional reset” rather than the beginning of a broader reduction plan. Chopra explained that some projects and roles introduced prematurely did not meet expectations, while others failed to deliver the desired outcomes. He emphasised the importance of being more strategic and deliberate in team-building and investments moving forward.Cars24 is offering comprehensive support to affected employees, including severance packages, career assistance, mentorship, and access to job openings within its network. The company is also providing resources for emotional wellness to help employees navigate this transition.The layoffs come amid Cars24’s efforts to streamline operations following a ₹498 crore net loss in FY24, despite a 25% increase in revenue to ₹6,917 crore.","Cars24 has laid off nearly 200 employees across various departments.

India shines for global consumer goods giants despite urban demand slowdown and global market turmoil,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/india-shines-for-global-consumer-goods-giants-despite-urban-demand-slowdown-and-global-market-turmoil/articleshow/120659345.cms,"AI-generated image (Credit: Lexica)

As global markets grapple with uncertainty and turmoil, India has emerged as a positive outlier for multinational consumer goods firms, even amid a slowdown in urban demand.Senior executives from leading companies — including Unilever, Procter & Gamble (P&G), Pernod Ricard, Reckitt, PepsiCo, Heineken, and L'Oréal — have highlighted India's significant contribution to growth among emerging markets during the recent quarter, according to a report by The Economic Times.While companies acknowledged softness in urban markets due to modest wage growth and inflationary pressures impacting household spending, they expressed optimism about a robust recovery in the current fiscal year.""India is driving mid-single-digit growth very nicely,"" said P&G Chief Financial Officer Andre Schulten during an investor call last week. ""The market gets better every time we look at it. We feel very solid about the growth opportunity there,"" he added.Over the past decade, sales of branded daily essentials in India — a nation of 1.4 billion people — have increasingly depended on rural markets, home to over 800 million people whose purchasing behavior closely tracks agricultural output.After a prolonged period of sluggishness that weighed on overall market performance until last year, rural demand has shown marked improvement over the past three quarters. However, urban India continues to experience subdued demand for a range of products, from groceries to lifestyle goods, for over a year now.""In India, the urban market continues to be soft, and we had anticipated that it would come back a little bit faster this year,"" said Noel Wallace, chief executive of Colgate-Palmolive, during an investor briefing late Friday.Despite challenges in the mass-market segments, demand for premium products has remained resilient. Companies like PepsiCo, Reckitt, and L'Oréal reported particularly strong performances across emerging markets during the March quarter, with India serving as a key growth driver.India remains the second-largest market for both Unilever and Pernod Ricard. While urban market softness could mean India does not retain its earlier position among the fastest-growing markets, both firms continue to view India as essential to their growth strategies.Fernando Fernandez, chief executive of Unilever, praised India’s consistent performance, saying, ""This is a market where we will be unblinking in our defence. When we get our growth engine moving, we know how to drive earnings ahead of growth,"" during a recent investor call.Pernod Ricard, the world’s second-largest distiller and owner of premium brands like Absolut vodka and Chivas Regal Scotch whisky, reported continued strong demand and premiumisation trends in India.Similarly, Heineken Chief Financial Officer Harald Van den Buch, owner of the Kingfisher beer brand, expressed confidence in India's growth momentum. ""In India, beer volume grew by a mid-single digit, continuing its growth momentum with premium volume growing in the 20s,"" he said during an analyst call in mid-April.","India has emerged as a positive outlier for multinational consumer goods firms, even amid a slowdown in urban demand.

Cardinals congregate in Rome to elect new Pope after death of Francis at 88: Who they are and what they do,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/cardinals-congregate-in-rome-to-elect-new-pope-after-death-of-francis-at-88-who-they-are-and-what-they-do/articleshow/120659396.cms,"High dignitaries of the Catholic Church

The Pope-makers

Created, not named

The importance of Cardinal Red

A political appointment

Declining privileges

Cardinals from all over the world have begun convening in Rome to prepare to hold a conclave to select a successor for Pope Francis , who passed away on Monday at the age of 88. As the Catholic Church stands at a pivotal transition, eyes turn to the men who will eventually select its new leader — but what is a cardinal, anyway?A cardinal, from the Latin cardinalis, meaning ""principal"", is one of the top officials of the Catholic Church, appointed by the pope to help govern. Most of the important dicasteries, the equivalent of government ministries within the Vatican, are led by cardinals. They have the official title of ""Cardinal of the Holy Roman Church.""Organized into the College of Cardinals , they have a dean — now the 91-year-old Italian Giovanni Battista Re — and constitute the pinnacle of Catholic leadership. Although cardinal is a title more than a defined position, a majority of cardinals are bishops stationed in various parts of the world, and some reside in Rome, exercising important posts within the Curia, the Church's central government.Of the 252 cardinals that exist today, only those below the age of 80, or ""cardinal electors,"" are actually allowed to cast a vote for a new pope. There are 135 such electors.The conclave is convened within the Sistine Chapel where the election happens under strict ceremonial and secrecy that has not greatly changed over the centuries. Once the cardinals have finished conducting the mourning ceremonies for Francis, the conclave will commence.Cardinals are not appointed; they are ""created"" by a unique papal bull. The word, derived from Roman usage, means that the recipient is promoted in rank because of his individual merits, not because he is assigned to an empty office.Under Vatican regulations, the pope may create cardinals from among men who are ""truly outstanding in doctrine, virtue, piety and prudence in practical matters.""Cardinals can be identified easily by their scarlet red vestments — a color formerly emblematic of the power of the Roman Senate, now symbolizing the blood of Christ and readiness to die for the Church.They have a sapphire ring, a pectoral cross, a crosier (a ceremonial staff), and a mitre (a ceremonial headdress) as part of their formal wear.The appointment of cardinals is not only a religious choice but also a very political one. Each pope exercises his appointing power to determine the future of the Church.Pope Francis significantly increased the College of Cardinals by appointing men from the ""peripheries"" — areas historically underrepresented by Rome — in order to make the Church more representative of the global, worldwide nature of Catholicism and to influence the election of his successor.In spite of their standing, the privileges cardinals once took for granted have been progressively eroded. Cardinals — who are formally addressed as ""Eminence"" — are just below the pope and can say Mass in any church outside Rome. They also have the right to be interred inside churches.But dramatic changes started coming into effect after the Second Vatican Council, which took away cardinals' indulgences like private train compartments and throne rooms in their houses.Pope Francis took it a step further: in 2021, he directed a reduction in cardinals' salaries to compensate for losses incurred due to the coronavirus pandemic, and in 2023, he abolished the tradition of providing them rent-free apartments within Vatican City.As the world observes Rome, attention has shifted to these influential leaders — who they are, how they were selected, and how they will define the next chapter of the Catholic Church.","A cardinal is one of the top officials of the Catholic Church, appointed by the pope to help govern.

""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job. Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.

This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Delhi Results 2025: 'LinkedIn Lessons' from Brand BJP's win and Brand AAP's loss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-results-2025-linkedin-lessons-from-brand-bjps-win-and-brand-aaps-loss/articleshow/118066797.cms,"AAP: From Disruptor to Establishment to Decline



AAP was the ultimate political startup—the kind that raises Series A, B, and C funding at record speed, becomes a unicorn, and then implodes under its own weight. It was supposed to be the alternative to traditional politics, the fresh face in a crowded market, a party that rejected caste, religion, and dynasty-driven politics.

But somewhere along the way, it stopped being a startup and started behaving like an old-school corporate giant—bloated, bureaucratic, and overconfident.

1) From Lean & Agile to Bureaucratic & Slow

AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach—the political equivalent of a D2C brand shaking up a legacy market.

Over time, it became centralized and top-heavy, with decision-making confined to a handful of leaders. MLAs became inaccessible, the leadership became distant, and ground-level mobilization weakened. No succession planning. Kejriwal remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force.

remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force. The result? Voters saw it as just another party, not the disruptor it once was.

2) A Reputation Built on Ethics, Lost to Scandals

AAP built its brand on fighting corruption—but its own leadership got embroiled in one of the biggest scandals of its time, the liquor policy scam.

Manish Sisodia, Sanjay Singh, and even Kejriwal himself faced corruption allegations, undoing years of anti-corruption positioning.

The Sheesh Mahal controversy—where Kejriwal’s residence was allegedly renovated with ₹45 crore of taxpayer money—completely shattered the “humble leader” narrative.

AAP’s response? Defensive, aggressive, and dismissive. Instead of damage control, it doubled down on denial—a classic PR blunder.

The perception shift was swift and brutal—from “anti-corruption warriors” to just another power-hungry political entity.

3) Ignoring the Middle-Class Voter That Built Its Base

AAP was originally the party of the middle class—frustrated taxpayers who wanted clean governance and economic relief.

Over time, its focus shifted to freebies and populist policies, leaving the middle class feeling ignored.

BJP stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters.

stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters. Kejriwal’s pre-election outreach to the middle class felt forced and last-minute—while BJP had already solidified its positioning.

Takeaway ? A business (or party) that forgets its core customer will eventually lose them.

4) Blaming External Factors Instead of Owning Failures

For 10 years, AAP blamed the Centre, the LG, and opposition parties for everything.

The “victim card” was effective in the early years but wore thin by 2025—voters expected governance, not excuses.

BJP flipped this weakness into an advantage, promising that with a BJP-led government, there would be no Centre-state conflicts, leading to “seamless governance.”

The narrative changed from “AAP vs. BJP” to “AAP vs. Results.” Lesson? Leaders who constantly shift blame instead of delivering solutions lose credibility.

5) Strategic Missteps and Lack of Political Alliances

AAP contested separately from Congress, which led to a split in the anti-BJP vote.

Rahul Gandhi’s direct attacks on Kejriwal made matters worse—AAP was getting hit from both sides.

Internal conflicts weakened the party further. Atishi and Saurabh Bharadwaj were seen as Kejriwal’s successors, but there was no clear transition strategy.

BJP: A Masterclass in Strategic Adaptation

BJP’s 2025 win in Delhi was not a Modi-centric sweep but a well-calibrated organizational comeback. After a lackluster 2024 Lok Sabha performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader.

performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader. Unlike AAP, BJP adapted, restructured, and executed flawlessly.

1) Moving Beyond Modi Dependency

BJP understood that Delhi’s electorate needed a more localized approach.

Instead of making the election about Modi, it focused on governance, urban issues, and direct voter engagement.

No CM face? It didn’t matter. The party projected collective leadership instead of relying on one individual.

By decentralizing its campaign, BJP looked more stable and future-ready.

2) Adopting AAP’s Own Strategies Against It

BJP neutralized AAP’s welfare advantage—promising free electricity, continued subsidies, and additional financial support for women.

Middle-class tax reliefs were announced just before the elections, ensuring they won over voters that AAP had neglected.

The manifesto focused on real urban issues—pollution control, traffic congestion, and infrastructure—exactly what AAP had failed to address convincingly.

Lesson? The best way to beat a competitor is to adopt their strengths while exposing their weaknesses.

3) Letting Congress Do The Attacking



BJP didn’t need to attack AAP aggressively—Rahul Gandhi and Congress did that for them.

By letting AAP and Congress fight it out, BJP consolidated its voter base while the opposition split.

AAP’s credibility suffered more because the attacks came from within the anti-BJP camp.

A strategic win, without unnecessary effort.

4) A Disciplined, Focused, and Well-Executed Campaign

BJP stayed on message, focusing on corruption, governance, and economic stability.

The campaign was structured and well-planned, unlike AAP’s which seemed reactive and disorganized.

The promise to investigate AAP’s corruption cases resonated with voters, reinforcing BJP’s stance on accountability.

In business terms? BJP had a clear marketing strategy, strong brand positioning, and flawless execution.

5) Final Takeaways

Adaptability is key. BJP recalibrated after its 2024 Lok Sabha setbacks, while AAP remained stagnant.

Brand trust is fragile. AAP built its image on honesty but lost credibility due to scandals and mismanagement.

Execution matters more than rhetoric. BJP delivered a disciplined, well-structured campaign.

Leadership succession planning is critical. AAP failed to build second-line leadership, while BJP showcased organizational depth.

Voters reward governance, not excuses. After a decade in power, AAP’s blame game no longer worked.

Politics, like business, rewards those who adapt, execute, and deliver.

Ah, another election, another flood of LinkedIn wisdom posts—where every poll result is a ""case study,"" every political leader is a ""CEO,"" and every campaign is an ""MBA-level lesson in leadership."" Some call it democracy, but on LinkedIn, it’s all about business jargon and corporate analogies.So, let’s break this down the LinkedIn way.BJP, on the other hand, had a structured, disciplined campaign with clear messaging and no internal rifts. In politics and business, a divided team rarely wins.","AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach.

Ten years of incumbency

Liquor scam, Sheesh Mahal dent Kejriwal's 'imandaar' image

No tie-up, Congress did strategic campaigning

Flood of freebies but no next-level of development

BJP focuses on Kejriwal, Hindutva takes back seat

BJP's latent vote

Rahul roasted Kejriwal as payback for Haryana

MCD with AAP: No excuses

Steady exodus of AAP leaders

AAP goes negative

The BJP on Saturday pulled off a major political upset by unseating the Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ) from Delhi after over 10 years. As per the latest Election Commission data, the BJP may win around 48 seats and the Kejriwal-led party may secure around 22 seats in the 70-seat Assembly.BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in a fierce contest from the New Delhi seat by a margin of 4,089 votes. Verma, 47, bagged 30,088 votes, while Kejriwal and Congress' Sandeep Dikshit got 25,999 votes and 4,568 votes.Kejriwal conceded his defeat and hoped that the BJP will fulfill all its promises.""We accept the mandate of the people with great humility. I congratulate the BJP for this victory and I hope they will fulfil all the promises for which people have voted for them,"" Kejriwal said in a video address posted on X.In the evening as the results were decalred, PM Modi kicked off his victory speech with a powerful chant of ""Yamuna Maiya ki Jai"". PM Modi declared that the people of Delhi were experiencing both relief and joy -- relief from the ""disaster"" (AAP-da governance) and joy in embracing a new era under BJP rule. ""I had written a letter to every Delhi resident, urging them to give the BJP a chance to serve in the 21st century...Today, I bow my head in gratitude to every family in Delhi for trusting us. You have given us love with an open heart, and I assure you that we will return it manifold through rapid development,"" PM Modi said.The Prime Minister also attacked the AAP over allegations of corruption against its leaders, saying that all links of such charges will be probed and those who ""looted"" money will have to return it.With the BJP set to regain control of Delhi after 27 years, what went wrong for the Aam Aadmi Party?After governing Delhi for a decade, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) faced significant anti-incumbency.While AAP achieved impressive results in health and education during its first two terms, and kept voters happy with power and water subsidies, unfulfilled promises, such as improved air quality, became major poll issues.The AAP's assertion that the BJP government at the Centre was creating roadblocks in its functioning began to be increasingly seen by voters as excuses, especially after ten years in power.The BJP's ""double engine"" promise, suggesting seamless governance between the central and state levels, appealed to voters against the backdrop of AAP's constant conflicts with the Centre. Furthermore, internal disarray within the AAP, with senior leaders facing jail time, added to the challenges of incumbency .The image of Arvind Kejriwal as an anti-corruption crusader suffered a setback due to several factors, most notably the controversy surrounding the now-scrapped liquor policy.The BJP accused the AAP government of turning Delhi into a ""city of drunkards"" with the new policy, and receiving crores in kickbacks from those who opened the vends.Probes by central agencies led to the arrest of top AAP leaders, including Arvind Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia, and Sanjay Singh. These arrests forced Sisodia to step down as deputy chief minister and kept the AAP in ""firefighting mode"", distracting from fulfilling its 2020 poll promises.Additionally, the ""Sheesh Mahal"" controversy, referring to the renovated residence of the chief minister, further dented Kejriwal's image. The BJP further highlighted a Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) report that indicated the renovation cost had increased from an initial estimate of Rs 7.91 crore to Rs 33.66 crore by completion.AAP has been synonymous with Arvind Kejriwal since its inception. Kejriwal, initially seen as an agent of change with his untucked shirt and no-nonsense demeanor, resonated with the common person.However, the anti-corruption image of Kejriwal and his party suffered irreparable damage, specially after the AAP leader's arrest in March 2024 on corruption allegations and his subsequent resignation as CM.While he was later granted bail, the leadership transition to Atishi and the circumstances surrounding Kejriwal's arrest damaged the party's image and cohesion.The absence of an alliance with the Congress party and the Congress's strategic campaigning likely contributed to the AAP's loss.In previous elections, the AAP had significantly reduced the Congress's presence in the Delhi assembly.Attempts to convince Congress workers to collaborate with AAP volunteers reportedly led to an ""existential crisis"" among them.The Congress decided to campaign aggressively against the AAP, sensing ""anger building up against the AAP"". Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra attacked the AAP in the final days of the Delhi campaign.The Congress further claimed the AAP did not want an alliance, with Kejriwal announcing all 70 candidates early on.The rise of AAP in Delhi has been congruous with the decline of the Congress. In 2013, AAP won 28 seats with a 29.49% vote share, while the Congress tally decreased to 8 seats from 43 in 2008. In 2015, Congress suffered a 15% decline in its vote share, while the AAP saw its support base rise by around 15%.While AAP's welfare schemes, such as free electricity and bus travel for women, initially garnered support, a lack of focus on infrastructure development and maintenance became a significant issue.The poor condition of roads and sewers across Delhi angered voters.Overflowing drains, potholed roads, and irregular garbage collection contributed to the party's unpopularity.The AAP's control over the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) meant it could not deflect blame for these issues onto the BJP. Voters in middle- and upper-middle-class areas were particularly affected by the deteriorating infrastructure.AAP's origins trace back to Anna Hazare’s anti-corruption movement, positioning the party as an alternative to the Congress in 2013.While AAP secured mandates in 2015 and 2020, their repeated promises and ""freebies"" seem to have lost their appeal.The promise of piped water connections for all in 2015 remains unfulfilled, as does the promise of full statehood for Delhi and the ""Rozgar Budget"" aimed at creating 20 lakh jobs.Kejriwal himself admitted that he had failed to fulfill three promises: cleaning the Yamuna, providing clean drinking water, and upgrading Delhi's roads. This acknowledgment gave the BJP an opportunity to attack the AAP, with Amit Shah mocking Kejriwal's promise to purify the Yamuna.The BJP's campaign strategy focused primarily on targeting Arvind Kejriwal and his government, rather than emphasising Hindutva, as it has often done during campainging in other state elections as well as previous Delhi polls.This approach likely resonated with a broader segment of the population, including those who may not have been inclined to support a religiously charged campaign. By focusing on issues such as corruption and governance, the BJP effectively undermined AAP's credibility and appealed to a wider range of voters.The BJP also focused on hyper-local issues such as air pollution, traffic, and public safety, and engaged with local Resident Welfare Associations. They also promoted central government schemes.The BJP also targeted specific demographics, including Purvanchalis and slum dwellers, and utilised an aggressive digital campaign with AI-enhanced content and memes targeting AAP.The BJP's consistent performance in the Lok Sabha polls in Delhi indicated a latent voter base that the party successfully mobilised this time around for the assembly elections.Despite AAP's strong performance in the assembly elections, the BJP had consistently swept Lok Sabha elections in the national capital, winning all seven seats.This pre-existing support base provided a foundation for the BJP's campaign and likely contributed to their victory.The BJP also strategically fielded Parvesh Verma, a strong Jat leader, in the New Delhi constituency, signaling their intention to win back the confidence of the Jat community, which had previously favoured AAP in Delhi elections.During the Delhi Assembly elections, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi launched strong criticisms against Arvind Kejriwal, which may have been payback for events in Haryana. Gandhi's attacks covered a range of issues, including alleged corruption, unfulfilled promises, and inaction on key issues.Like the BJP, Gandhi attacked Kejriwal over the alleged liquor scam and accused him of living in a ""Sheesh Mahal"" while engaging in corrupt practices.Gandhi said that Kejriwal made false promises, ""similar to Prime Minister Narendra Modi"", particularly regarding cleaning the Yamuna River. He also challenged Kejriwal to drink Delhi's tap water, implying it was still polluted despite promises to clean it.The Aam Aadmi Party's (AAP) win in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) in 2022 proved to be a double-edged sword, ultimately hurting the party instead of helping it. AAP had promised a cleaner city with world-class roads, but it fell short on both accounts. The MCD House was in limbo, and the Standing Committee, which controls all financial powers, was never formed. The AAP repeatedly accused the Centre of creating hurdles through the Lieutenant Governor and stalling projects.This time around, voters held the AAP accountable for the deteriorating civic infrastructure across Delhi.AAP's performance in the MCD was a letdown for the people of Delhi. The party failed to address critical issues such as clearing garbage, repairing roads, and cleaning clogged sewers. Erratic water supply and overflowing sewers that were never repaired because Rs 4,000 crore for the Delhi Jal Board was not released further hurt the party.Senior party leaders stated that the MCD functioning had collapsed under the AAP, and no work was being done, leading to frustration among councillors.The steady departure of senior leaders from AAP over time might have also weakened the party's organisational structure and public image.The exit of prominent figures like Prashant Bhushan, Yogendra Yadav, Mayank Gandhi, and Kumar Vishwas, who had dared to disagree with Arvind Kejriwal, and repeatedly accused Kejriwal of having an ""autocratic"" style of leadership.Resignation of senior leaders like Kailash Gahlot, who cited the party's focus on political agenda over fulfilling promises, along with internal challenges, signalled internal discord.The BJP had termed Gahlot's resignation a ""courageous move"".Negative campaigning by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) centered on issues like Yamuna River pollution, the Delhi Police, and the Election Commission (EC) may have affected public perception of the AAP government.In the lead up to the polls, Kejriwal accused the BJP-led Haryana government of poisoning the Yamuna River, which supplies drinking water to Delhi. He claimed that the Haryana government deliberately sent polluted waters to Delhi to create an artificial water scarcity and blame the AAP.The AAP also repeatedly levelled accusations of voter fraud and irregularities against the BJP as well as the EC.AAP alleged that the Election Commission and Delhi Police were shielding BJP workers and accused them of ""hooliganism"". Kejriwal wrote to the Chief Election Commissioner, expressing concern over the intimidation and harassment of AAP volunteers by BJP workers. The EC responded that no written complaints could be traced in most cases but assured that all registered complaints are investigated.Kejriwal further criticised the Election Commission for allegedly refusing to make Form 17C public, a document detailing the number of votes polled at each booth. AAP then launched a website, transparentelections.in, claiming to upload Form 17C data for all constituencies to present the data in an accessible format.The EC dismissed Kejriwal's claims regarding Form 17C, stating that copies had already been provided to polling agents at each booth after voting, as per Rule 49S of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961.","BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. Verma, 47, bagged 30,088 votes, while Kejriwal and Congress' Sandeep Dikshit got 25,999 votes and 4,568 votes. Kejriwal conceded his defeat and hoped that the BJP will fulfill all its promises.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118065596,imgsize-587609,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/118065596.jpg"
What recent polls say about Donald Trump's approval ratings,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-recent-polls-say-about-donald-trumps-approval-ratings/articleshow/120653906.cms,"Donald Trump's approval rates are falling, according to all recent polls.

Men are not supporting Trump any more



President Donald Trump's approval ratings have reached an all-time low after his tariff war against countries and this is the unanimous outcome of all recent polling, the latest being the New York Times/Sienna College one which gave Trump an approval rating of 42 per cent. 54 per cent said they disapproved of his job performance, putting him 12 points underwater in net approval.Trump’s approval rating is considerably lower than the rating for other recent presidents nearly 100 days into their administrations.Trump has a net negative approval rating on a wide range of issues pollsters asked respondents about, including immigration and the economy — the two issues that had consistently been seen as his strengths since the start of his first term, the NYT poll said. The poll was conducted April 21-24 among 913 registered voters. The margin of error was 3.8 points.One of the major takeaways from these recent polling is that Trump's approval rating with men is turning sour. According to a Pew Research poll, conducted between April 7-13 among 3,589 Americans, Trump's approval among men has dropped from a net positive in February (52 per cent approve, 46 per cent disapprove) to a net negative in April (44 per cent approve, 55 per cent disapprove). That represents a 17-point swing in a matter of months. The latest poll had a margin of error of +/- 1.8 percentage points.The latest Economist/YouGov poll, conducted between April 19-22 among 1,625 respondents, shows Trump at 45 percent approval and 49 percent disapproval among male respondents—down from 55/40 just a month earlier. That represents a 19-point net drop in just four weeks. Both polls had a margin of error of +/- 3.3 percentage points.A Fox News poll, conducted between April 18-21 among 1,104 registered voters, found male support at 48/51, down from a breakeven 50/50 split in March.","The latest New York Times/Sienna College poll gave Trump an approval rating of 42 per cent, putting him 12 points underwater in net approval.

Hubris Maximus

'I know how ruthless he is'



'Elon Musk cannot stand being told what to do'



A new book on Elon Musk , published this week, has revealed that a young Musk told an investor 30 years ago that he is the 'reincarnation' of Greek conqueror Alexander the Great. It was at a lunch that Derek Proudian , then at Mohr Davidow Ventures, met a young Musk 30 years ago. The moot point was bankrolling Musk's first startup Zip2 which aimed to bring the Yellow Pages online. Musk told him Zip2 was going to be the biggest company ever.“No—you don’t understand,"" Mus said. “I’m the reincarnation of the spirit of Alexander the Great.”Proudian was not willing to give any importance to what young Musk was saying but Musk kept on saying that he had got the samurai spirit. “I’ve got the samurai spirit,” he said. “I’d rather commit seppuku than fail,"" the book titledby Washington Post's Faiz Siddiqui says, as reported by The Daily Beast.Proudian said in the book he did not take the words of 23-year-old Musk seriously but now that he looks back he knows how smart he is and how ruthless he is. “I am really concerned because I know how smart this guy is and I know how much money he has and I know how ruthless he is, and it’s playing out in front of my own eyes,” he said.Ross Gerber, a former Tesla investor and one of the company’s biggest cheerleaders, told Siddiqui that Musk cannot stand being told what to do—even by the Securities and Exchange Commission. “He just basically has a complete disdain for any authority period,” said Gerber, whose relationship with Musk eventually soured. “I have a completely different opinion about the hubris of thumbing your nose at the people that could really hurt you.”The book has details of the time when Musk bought Twitter for $44 billion in 2022. When he called the executives for a meeting, it was bizarre. ""One high-level exec recalled waiting for 90 minutes outside of Musk’s office. When he was finally allowed to enter, Musk was watching a YouTube video on his phone. There ensued an awkward 10 minutes of silence during which the executive waited for Musk to acknowledge his presence,"" the Daily Beast report narrated.Siddiqui wrote how whenever he tried to reach Musk for a story, Musk would invariably say ""Give my regards to your puppetmaster,"" referring to Post's owner Jeff Bezos.","A new book on Elon Musk has revealed that a young Musk told an investor 30 years ago that he is the'reincarnation' of Greek conqueror Alexander the Great.

Grace Without Grandstanding

The Anti-Influencer in an Influencer Age

Politics, Without Losing the Plot

The Long Game

When the Vances landed in India this week, the itinerary looked textbook: meet the Prime Minister, pose at the Taj Mahal, sprinkle in a few cultural references for good measure. Standard fare for visiting dignitaries, performed thousands of times before.But what unfolded was something very different — a subtle masterclass in cultural diplomacy , and at the heart of it was Usha Vance .In a political era dominated by noise, posturing, and performative outrage, Usha Vance’s quiet, unassuming presence achieved what armies of spin doctors and PR consultants usually fail to do: she connected.And in doing so, she drew comparisons to the gold standard of American charm offensives abroad — Jackie Kennedy in Paris, 1961.The most telling moment of the trip came not from a prepared speech or a state dinner, but a simple, almost instinctive gesture.As JD Vance spoke at Jaipur’s cultural centre, he stumbled on a pronunciation and turned, mid-speech, to ask his wife, ""Did I pronounce that right, honey?""It wasn’t a rhetorical line. It wasn’t crafted for the cameras.It was something rarer: a moment of natural intimacy, trust, and authenticity.In that moment, Usha Vance wasn’t just a spouse. She was an anchor — the confidante without whom the Vice President himself seemed adrift.It was also a preview of the trip's underlying reality: JD Vance may have held the title, but Usha Vance held the stage.Much like Jackie Kennedy’s visit to Paris six decades ago, Usha Vance’s presence rewrote the mood of the trip. Jackie enchanted the French not with policy pronouncements, but by embodying a vision of America that was cultured, refined, and impossibly elegant.Usha Vance, too, projected an America many Indians still admire — one where success is earned, roots are honoured, and dignity does not have to be loud to be powerful. She did it without flowing designer gowns or staged glamour shots. She wore practical flats, let her grey streaks show, and stepped into interviews in the same outfit she wore sightseeing. She didn't “represent” India — she understood it, because it was part of her own story. In doing so, she touched something deeper than policy: cultural memory.At a time when every political figure is expected to be a personal brand — hashtags, filters, inspirational quotes ready for algorithmic distribution — Usha Vance's refusal to participate in the theatre made her stand out even more. She didn’t document every meal or pose for TikTok challenges.She wasn’t selling a story — she was the story: the Indian-American daughter of immigrants, navigating two worlds with an ease that felt both effortless and earned. And when the Vance children turned up in traditional Indian attire, it didn’t feel like a photo-op. It felt like a homecoming. This was soft power , not shouted from podiums but whispered through generations.Usha Vance's journey is, inevitably, a political one.Once a registered Democrat, now standing comfortably by the side of a Vice President aligned with Trump-era nationalism, her transformation unsettles many.How does someone who knows the immigrant struggle, who thrived in the meritocratic grind of Yale Law School, reconcile herself with MAGA politics?The answer lies partly in personal loyalty — to her husband, to her own experiences.But it also speaks to something larger: the refusal to be reduced to a demographic stereotype.In India, these contradictions weren’t interrogated. They were understood.India knows that identity isn’t always linear. That tradition and modernity, loyalty and ambition, rootlessness and belonging can — and often must — coexist.Unlike most American second ladies, Usha Vance is only just beginning to shape her public persona.She has hired a small team. A portfolio of issues — likely revolving around family, education, and immigration — is in the works.For now, though, she has kept her focus squarely on being a mother, a wife, and, when required, a reluctant public figure.It is precisely this restraint that gives her such quiet power.When she finally does step forward with initiatives of her own, she will bring to them the most precious political currency of all: credibility.Not manufactured. Not focus-grouped.Lived.When Jackie Kennedy left Paris, Charles de Gaulle famously remarked, ""I do not know how successful the President was, but I do know the First Lady conquered Paris."" If there is a modern parallel, it was written this week, somewhere between the crowded streets of Jaipur and the sunlit marble of the Taj Mahal. JD Vance was the Vice President on official duty. But it was Usha Vance who conquered India. Not with grand gestures. Not with rehearsed slogans. But simply by embodying a version of America — and India — that feels timeless and aspirational. In a world often weighed down by spectacle and cynicism, Usha Vance offered something rarer: a quiet grace that both nations could recognise — and celebrate — as their own.","Usha Vance's quiet, unassuming presence achieved what armies of spin doctors and PR consultants usually fail to do: she connected. In doing so, she drew comparisons to the gold standard of American charm offensives abroad — Jackie Kennedy in Paris, 1961.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120648592,imgsize-80230,width-400,resizemode-4/Jackie-Kennedy-and-the-Vances.jpg"

'Jung karni hai to...': How Pakistanis are trolling themselves on social media,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/jung-karni-hai-to-how-pakistanis-are-trolling-themselves-on-social-media/articleshow/120622600.cms,"After the Pahalgam massacre—where terrorists from Pakistan crossed the border and executed 26 people in cold blood—the usual geopolitical script began to unfold. India condemned, Pakistan denied, and the West reached for its thesaurus of euphemisms : “gunmen,” “militants,” “insurgents.” But something unusual happened this time. The sharpest rebuke didn’t come from New Delhi or Washington. It came from within Pakistan itself.Not from TV anchors or ministers. But from everyday Pakistanis—with Wi-Fi in one hand, rage in the other, and no illusions left to break.Take this tweet: “Jung karni ho to 9 baje se pehle kar lena, 9:15 per gas chali jati hai hamari.”Translation: If you're planning a war, please do it before 9am—we run out of gas after that.It would be hilarious if it weren’t heartbreakingly accurate. Pakistan, a nuclear power, can’t guarantee a cup of tea in the morning.Another tweet offered mock-condolences: “People of Karachi, Faisalabad, Multan, Islamabad—we are sorry.”A citizen apologising not for terrorism—but for governance. Or the lack of it.This isn’t your everyday political frustration. This is something more profound. More fatalistic. What we're witnessing is post-collapse satire—not born from resistance, but from resignation. Not defiance, but detachment. Pakistanis aren’t mocking their military, politicians, or failing institutions because they’re angry. They're doing it because there's nothing left to do but laugh.The timing of this public self-roast is revealing. Pakistan has once again been implicated in a cross-border terrorist attack. The victims were targeted for their religion. The attackers were affiliated with Lashkar-e-Taiba ’s proxy, The Resistance Front. And while the world watched, Pakistanis didn’t take to the streets to support their “freedom fighters.” They didn’t protest Indian foreign policy. They turned inward—and began roasting the very state that enabled this tragedy.Not because they were suddenly overcome with guilt. But because they’ve understood what the world still struggles to say aloud:The real victim of Pakistan’s obsession with jihad isn’t India. It’s Pakistanis themselves.Their fuel. Their food. Their currency. Their safety. Their dignity.All sacrificed at the altar of “strategic depth.”While generals polish their medals and issue denials, the public boils with a mix of exhaustion and clarity. There’s no electricity. Gas is rationed like contraband. Inflation hovers at 30%. The rupee is in freefall. The government runs on loans. And when Pakistan was supposed to host the ICC Champions Trophy, India refused to show up—forcing Pakistan to play on neutral ground in Dubai. The punchline wrote itself: even Pakistan can’t host itself without a connecting flight.This level of civic self-awareness would have once been dangerous. A decade ago, a sarcastic tweet could get you disappeared. Today, the dam has broken. Not because the state has grown tolerant—but because the people have grown numb. The rot is no longer underground. It’s trending on X.If memes are the last resort of a powerless populace, then Pakistanis are now full-time philosophers. Their humour is bleak, their metaphors are postmodern, and their sarcasm is indistinguishable from sadness. This is not the comedy of rebellion. This is the comedy of collapse.After Pahalgam, the rest of the world looked at Pakistan with suspicion. But for once, Pakistanis looked inward—and they laughed. Not because they didn’t care. But because they’ve stopped pretending that anything will change. The state has lost the plot. The people have rewritten it as dark comedy.And so, in the aftermath of yet another tragedy, it wasn’t India that needed to respond. The loudest condemnation came from within Pakistan. Not through op-eds or diplomatic cables, but through memes, tweets, and deadpan jokes. The only thing that still functions on time in Pakistan today is the punchline.They mocked their inability to keep the lights on. Their dependence on bailouts. Their cricketing humiliations. Their rulers. Their uniforms.It was gallows humour in a gaslit republic.Albert Camus would’ve called it freedom—the moment you stop asking why and simply push the boulder again. That’s the Sisyphus Clause.India, despite all its flaws, still chases Jefferson’s promise of happiness—through growth, dissent, and democracy.Pakistan? It has stopped expecting anything. And in that quiet surrender, it has turned its citizens into jesters, philosophers, and unwilling realists.They don’t protest anymore. They don’t revolt. They meme. Because in Pakistan, even tragedy comes with load-shedding. And the only thing that ever arrives on time… is the joke.","After the Pahalgam massacre, Pakistanis turned inward and began roasting the very state that enabled this tragedy.

Overlooked letter shows Shakespeare was not a neglectful husband,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/overlooked-letter-shows-shakespeare-was-not-a-neglectful-husband/articleshow/120632792.cms,"NYT photo

Any clue about William Shakespeare's life usually excites scholars, but one piece of evidence had been neglected for decades. Now, a new analysis of that overlooked document seems to shatter a long-standing narrative about the Bard's bad marriage.Shakespeare was 18 in 1582 when he married Anne Hathaway, daughter of a family friend in Stratford-upon-Avon, in her mid-20s and pregnant. For centuries, it was thought he left his wife and children behind for a literary life in London, seeking to avoid ""the humiliation of domestic feuds"", as one 19th-century essayist put it. This view of Shakespeare's wife as a ""distant encumbrance"" suited scholars who thought ""Shakespeare was far too interesting to be a married guy,"" said Matthew Steggle, a professor at University of Bristol, England. The perception was bolstered by the fact that Shakespeare had left her his ""second best bed"" in his will. But Steggle's research, expected to be published this week in the journal Shakespeare, suggests the writer was not detached from his marriage after all.The hint lies in a fragment of a 17th-century letter addressing a ""Mrs Shakspaire,"" found in the binding of a book published in 1608. The letter was noted in 1978 by an amateur historian, but got minimal attention, even after the book was unbound in 2016, revealing what appeared to be part of a reply from Shakespeare's wife, Steggle said.If it really was addressed to Mrs Shakespeare, ""it is self-evidently remarkable,"" Steggle said - it offers new clues about their relationship, and suggests Mrs Shakespeare lived for a time in London with her husband. If she did live in London, she was possibly back in Stratford by the time she received the letter, around 1607 - though not necessarily because her husband wanted independence. Steggle says ""there is an obvious reason to avoid London in 1603-4, namely the very bad wave of plague"". Also, the upcoming arrival of their first grandchild after daughter Susanna's 1607 marriage ""would surely be a good time"" for Hathaway to be back in Stratford.Steggle says her movements should be reconsidered with an eye to her ""possible absences from London rather than her perpetual absence"". The letter concerned money for a fatherless child named John. It called upon her to pay money, most likely held in trust for him, a pledge her husband may have undertaken, and referred to a time when she ""dwelt in trinitie lane,"" which Steggle believes refers to a location in London.","William Shakespeare was 18 in 1582 when he married Anne Hathaway, daughter of a family friend. For centuries, it was thought he left his wife and children behind for a literary life in London.

"Why Annabel Elliot, Queen Camilla’s sister, refuses to curtsy her despite royal protocol",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/why-annabel-elliot-queen-camillas-sister-refuses-to-curtsy-her-despite-royal-protocol/articleshow/120612332.cms,"Annabel (L) and Camilla (R): AP file photos

Annabel Elliot , younger sister to the British Queen Camilla and official “companion” to her, has said she still cannot bring herself to curtsy to her elder sibling—even two decades after Camilla entered the royal family.The revelation came in a new Tatler profile written by royal biographer Robert Hardman to mark the 20th wedding anniversary of King Charles and Queen Camilla.Although royal customs have relaxed over time—and the official royal website says there are no compulsory gestures—curtsying remains common within the royal household. For most, especially insiders like Elliot who hold formal roles, such traditions are still followed.Elliot, an interior designer by profession, said the formality feels unnatural despite her sister’s royal status. “I think she’s transitioned beautifully, actually. I mean, I sometimes look at her, and I can’t really believe it,” she said, reflecting on Camilla’s journey from private citizen to Queen.While Elliot may skip the curtsy, her love and support for Camilla are unwavering. She has been described as the Queen’s emotional anchor, especially during a difficult year in 2024, which saw family health challenges and personal loss.In the BBC documentary Charles III: The Coronation Year, Elliot appeared visibly moved as she recalled watching her sister depart for Westminster Abbey in the golden coach. “It was quite a moment,” she said, recalling how surreal it felt to see someone she grew up with take the throne beside King Charles.",Annabel Elliot is the younger sister to the British Queen Camilla.
