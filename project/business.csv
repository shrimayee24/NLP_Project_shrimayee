"Army opens fire after detecting suspicious movement along LoC, search operations under way",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/army-opens-fire-after-detecting-suspicious-movement-along-loc-search-operations-under-way/articleshow/112275950.cms,"NEW DELHI: Army troops fired warning shots after detecting suspicious movement of two groups of infiltrators along the Line of Control ( LoC ) in the Akhnoor and Sunderbani sectors of Jammu and Kashmir, early Monday morning.Despite the heightened alert, no direct exchange of fire occurred, and a massive search operation is now underway in both regions.According to officials, the first incident occurred around 1:30 am in the Battal sector of Akhnoor on the outskirts of Jammu. Alert troops noticed suspicious activity involving three to four individuals and responded by illuminating the area with flares and deploying drones for surveillance. Reinforcements were quickly mobilized to establish a tight cordon around the area, and a search operation commenced at first light.Simultaneously, troops in the Sunderbani-Nowshera sector of Rajouri district detected suspicious movement around 12:30 am and fired a few warning rounds. This area is also being combed as part of a broader effort to secure the LoC and prevent any possible infiltration.The heightened security measures come on the fifth anniversary of the abrogation of Article 370, which granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir. Authorities have significantly increased security across the region to manage any potential unrest or security threats associated with the anniversary.The ongoing search operations are focused on ensuring that no infiltrators have crossed the border and to maintain the integrity of the LoC. The Indian Army remains on high alert in light of the current security situation and the anniversary's significance.Security forces are coordinating closely with local intelligence agencies to address any emerging threats and ensure the safety of the region. The situation remains under close monitoring as the search efforts continue.","Army troops fired warning shots after detecting suspicious movement of two groups of infiltrators along the Line of Control ( LoC ) in the Akhnoor and Sunderbani sectors of Jammu and Kashmir.

Why trial judges should not just ‘play it safe’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-trial-judges-should-not-just-play-it-safe/articleshow/112274371.cms,"Arbitrary Arrests,

Bail Denial

Preventive Arrests Exceed Prosecutions

Delays In Securing Bail

Need To Question Assumptions

The author is Team Lead, Crime & Punishment, at Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy

On July 28, the Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud, speaking at a conference in Bengaluru, said: “Trial judges are increasingly playing it safe, not granting bail on important issues of serious crimes.” He emphasised that judges should be more receptive to the need for accommodating the concerns of people seeking liberty. He also highlighted that delays in granting bail “compound the problem of those facing arbitrary arrests”.These statements underscore two pressing issues within the criminal justice system : arbitrary arrests and the frequent denial of bail — both of which are affronts to personal liberty .The CJI’s concerns are well-founded. The police exercise unbridled power to arrest anyone on suspicion or apprehension of an offence. The courts, meant to check this power, are often too reluctant to grant bail. Laws, especially special legislations, further erode the fundamental principle of ‘bail, not jail’ by imposing unreasonably harsh conditions for bail, often requiring judges to make a preliminary assessment of guilt.On July 29, a day after the CJI’s comments, an SUV driver was arrested for driving through a waterlogged road near a coaching institute in Delhi where three people drowned due to waterlogging. He was charged with culpable homicide and initially denied bail, only to be released after spending four days in custody.Then, on July 30, Uttar Pradesh assembly passed an amendment to the Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversions Act, 2021, imposing stringent bail conditions similar to those in the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, and the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985. These laws require judges to conclude that reasonable grounds exist to show the accused is not guilty of the offence before they grant bail. Anecdotes, however, do not present the complete picture of the problem that confronts us.'Latest data from the National Crime Records Bureau show that 32 lakh people were arrested for offences under the Indian Penal Code, 1860, in 2022, and another 21.6 lakh for offences under special laws. In comparison, over 80 lakh people were preventively arrested under provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure,1973, and other state-specific provisions. This is 50% more than arrests for crimes that were actually committed. While around 80% of these individuals were released within 24 hours, many remained in police or judicial custody for extended periods. What is crucial to note is that courts do not get to test the necessity and validity of the majority of these arrests, fostering a culture of arbitrary detentions that escape judicial scrutiny.Data from prisons in India also show how arrests, pretrial, and undertrial detention impact the right to personal liberty. At the end of 2022, there were 4.3 lakh undertrials in Indian prisons, accounting for 76% of the total prison population. During the same year, 15 lakh undertrials were released from prison, with 95% of them released on bail. This may suggest that the bail system is functioning adequately.However, the details reveal a deeper issue: at the end of 2022, around 68% of undertrials in Indian prisons had been in custody for at least three months. Of these, 11,448 had spent over five years in prison as undertrials. This extended pretrial and undertrial detention reflects a systemic failure that contradicts the very essence of personal liberty. Even as the trial courts’ reluctance to grant bail proactively is concerning, delays in high courts exacerbate the problem. Almost 40% of bail matters in high courts take over a month for disposal, with median disposal times ranging from 28 days to 156 days for many high courts (Daksh, 2023). These delays further undermine the efficacy of the bail system and contribute to prolonged and unjust detentions.Even as arbitrary arrests and delays in the disposal of bail applications contribute to a burgeoning crisis of overcrowded prisons and a broader issue of personal liberty, the laws add to the problem by categorising more offences as cognisable, providing wide powers of arrest, and imposing stringent conditions for granting bail.So, is there a solution? The legislature can ensure that criminal laws and procedures do not overly rely on jail terms and police powers of arrest are restricted to absolutely necessary situations. The judiciary can adopt a more proactive approach to protect personal liberty and avoid normalising pretrial and undertrial detention.The police can be sensitised to the fact that personal liberty is the most cherished of fundamental rights and should not be routinely trampled upon. Also, there’s a need to question the premise that police remand is a prerequisite for any investigation, and that judicial custody is necessary to ensure trial.","Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud said judges should be more receptive to the need for accommodating the concerns of people seeking liberty. The police exercise unbridled power to arrest anyone on suspicion or apprehension of an offence. The courts, meant to check this power, are often too reluctant to grant bail.

Natural diamond hub eyes lion's share in lab gems,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/natural-diamond-hub-eyes-lions-share-in-lab-gems/articleshow/112273927.cms,"SURAT: India, the undisputed natural diamonds processing behemoth, is sniffing a chance of establishing itself as the world's largest lab-grown diamonds (LGD) maker and exporter.The massive fall in LGD prices over the last year has forced some of the leading global firms making these synthetic gems to reconsider their positions. The relatively young Indian LGD firms have been quick to capitalize on the situation by offering their products at highly competitive prices.The average per carat price of LGD plummeted to around $179 in 2023-24 from $355 in 2022-23. Unable to sustain such a sharp fall, several international firms like WD LGD, the largest LGD maker in the US, filed for bankruptcy last year.Similarly, international natural diamond behemoth De Beers suspended its LGD production for jewellery in May. The latest to join the shop shutters is Diam Concept, a French man-made diamonds firm, which went into receivership in July.Local firms have the inherent advantage of lower costs of growing, cutting-polishing, jewellery manufacturing, and a global marketing network. In 2022-23, India's LGD exports were 4.73 million carats, worth $1,680.29 million. In 2023-24, the export of LGD was 7.81 million carats, but fell in value terms to $1,402.44 million.Industry insiders say that rising LGD production in India has been pulling down prices for the last few years, while firms operating in foreign countries prefer to exit due to plummeting profits.These firms made huge profits when LGD prices were higher and in short supply. ""But with dropping profits, it proves difficult for them to meet the expenses in their region of operation. In India, the production costs are much lower; hence we can manage with lower profits as well,"" Dinesh Navadiya, chairman of Indian Diamond Institute, says. Industry sources said there could be other financial and business reasons behind developments in these firms, but stiff global LGD competition cannot be ruled out.Vallabh Lakhani, a leading LGD manufacturer, said: ""It's true that Indian firms are giving tough competition globally. While some foreign firms are still in the race with better technology, India too has close competition from China in smaller diamonds, and it may toughen if they succeed in manufacturing big (more than one carat) diamonds."" Vipul Shah, chairman of Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC), said: ""While some international players have scaled back or exited the market, it's essential to consider the broader context. India's emergence as a global LGD manufacturing hub has been phenomenal. Our country's diamond expertise, strong infrastructure, skilled workforce, and cost-effective operations have positioned us as a preferred destination for LGD production."" ""Indian LGD industry can give tough competition since we grow our diamonds, we already have the world's best cutting and polishing infrastructure, and we are also doing well in jewellery manufacturing. We already have a marketing network to sell our products globally,"" Babu Vaghani, president of LGD Association, said. Rajni Chanchad, another LGD maker, says: ""We have a better level-playing field for jewellery manufacturing.""","The average per carat price of LGD plummeted to around $179 in 2023-24 from $355 in 2022-23.

Government set to bring bill to curb waqf board powers on assets,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/government-set-to-bring-bill-to-curb-waqf-board-powers-on-assets/articleshow/112253430.cms,"Bill also eyes changes in compositions of waqf boards

NEW DELHI: In a major step, government wants to curb the ""unfettered"" powers of Waqf Boards to declare any property a 'waqf asset' and take control of it.Sources said the Cabinet on Friday evening discussed 40-odd amendments in the Wakf Act (known as Waqf Act before 2013), including ones to check the jurisdiction, considered arbitrary in many quarters, of Waqf Boards which now control assets running into lakhs of crores of rupees across the country.Under the proposed amendments, Waqf Boards' claims, which were previously unrestricted, will be subject to mandatory verification. A similar mechanism of mandatory verification has been proposed also for properties for which Waqf Boards and individual owners have made claims and counter-claims.Though an official briefing on Friday evening on Cabinet decisions did not mention this move, sources indicated that a Bill to amend the Wakf Act is likely to be introduced in Parliament next week.Sources also said that the two provisions of mandatory verification of properties, which would check arbitrary powers of Waqf Boards, are the major amendments proposed to the Act. At present, these entities have powers to tag any property as waqf asset. More than 8.7 lakh properties across the country, totalling around 9.4 lakh acres, are under the jurisdiction of Waqf Boards.The need for such legislation arose as there were several representations from Muslim intellectuals, women and different sects such as Shia and Bohras, among others, seeking changes in the existing law, sources said, underlining that the preparation to bring amendments had started much before the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. They also added that preliminary perusal of the laws across Islamic nations such as Oman, Saudi Arabia and others show that none of these countries have given such sweeping powers to one entity.More sweeping powers were conferred on Waqf Boards by bringing amendments to the original Act during the UPA govt in 2013, which have been a major bone of contention among waqf authorities, individual property owners, and several state entities, including the Archaeological Survey of India.TOI has learned that the Bill also proposes changes in the composition of Waqf Boards and also seeks to repeal some provisions of the current law.The Wakf Act, 1995 was enacted to regulate ‘auqaf’ (assets donated and notified as waqf) by a wakif — the person who dedicates a property for any purpose recognised by the Muslim law as pious, religious or charitable.Earlier, govt had taken note of sweeping powers of state Waqf Boards to stake claim on any property and also delay in conducting a survey of such property in most states. Government had also considered the possibility of involving district magistrates in monitoring of waqf properties to prevent misuse of the assets. Sources said the flaws in the appeal process were also under scrutiny.","Cabinet discussed 40-odd amendments in the Wakf Act (known as Waqf Act before 2013) Bill also eyes changes in compositions of waqf boards.

KOCHI: At 1:30 am on Tuesday, Neethu Jojo made the first phone call that let the world know of the tragedy that was about to unfold in Wayanad .As a resident of Chooralmala and recognising the telltale signs of a devastation unfolding - the roar of the wind, the thunder of rocks tumbling down and the gushing water that entered her home - Neethu lost no time in calling up Wayanad Institute of Medical Sciences ( WIMS ) where she worked as an executive.""She called me up around 1:30 am. She told me that there was a massive landslide in her area, and the area was being inundated. She asked me to send a vehicle to rescue them,"" Shanavas Palliyal, deputy general manager at WIMS, told TOI.Palliyal pacified Neethu, telling her that help was on the way and then got around to arranging it.It is around 40-45 minutes’ drive from our hospital. So, I asked her to wait for some time. Then, I called the police station in Meppadi but the line was busy. Then I tried the number at Kalpetta station, but the cops there were unaware of the landslide. Then I dialled 100 and got to the control room at Thiruvananthapuram and shared the news,” Palliyal said.An ambulancewas rushed to Neethu’s house at Chooralmala from the medical college. But the bridge beyond Chooralmala town was blocked by an uprooted tree and the ambulance was stalled. By the time a smaller ambulance — an Omni van — was found and sent to the place, it was too late.Inside Neethu’s house, the situation was dire with the water rising by the minute. She urged her husband Jojo to take their five-year-old son and her parents to leave the place and seek higher ground. As a member of the healthcare industry, Neethu’s caregiver instincts had kicked in. She told her husband that she would follow them soon, once she had gathered the few neighbours who were moving in the direction of her house. Her Samaritan nature was to cost her life. Around 4am, the second more devastating landslide occurred.Palliyal said that he called her again at this point but all he could hear was Neethu’s panicked voice and that of her neighbours. “The river started to widen and change its course in the area where her house was located. She along with others was washed away,” he said.Neethu’s body was retrieved from Soochimala waterfalls. But initially, there was some confusion which delayed things. “It was her bangle which became the key for her husband Jojo to make sure it was Neethu’s body,” Palliyal said.","Neethu Jojo, an executive at Wayanad Institute of Medical Sciences, lost her life in a landslide.

Land jihad big threat to demography: Himanta

GUWAHATI: BJP-governed Assam is ready with a proposed law mandating life imprisonment for anyone convicted of "" love jihad "", CM Himanta Biswa Sarma said Sunday, less than a week after the UP assembly passed a Bill amending the state's 2021 anti-conversion legislation to increase the punishment for offences linked to marriage or elopement from the current maximum 10-year jail term to life.A law requiring prior chief ministerial consent for land-related transactions between Hindus and Muslims is also in the works to halt what Sarma labelled "" land jihad "".""We spoke about love jihad during the elections. It is a real and serious issue, involving forced conversions and deceitful romantic relationships. In the next few days, we aim to take steps to make this punishable with a life sentence,"" the CM saidIf a Muslim wants to buy a Hindu’s property or a Hindu wants to buy a Muslim’s property, it will be subject to scrutiny, Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said at BJP ’s state executive meeting in Guwahati.Besides Uttar Pradesh in 2021, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Madhya Pradesh have enacted anti-conversion laws with separate and stricter clauses against change in religion deemed to linked to “love jihad”.In Assam, BJP-led govt last month moved to repeal Assam Muslim Marriages and Divorce Registration Act and Rules of 1935, which permitted underage marriages under specific conditions.CM Sarma mentioned at the BJP meeting that his govt viewed “land jihad” as a serious threat to the state’s demography and had al-ready reclaimed encroached areas through a series of eviction campaigns.He said a span equivalent to the size of Chandigarh had been freed from encroachment by people from a particular community.BJP is committed to protecting every right of the indigenous people of the state, the CM said. “We will have a new law to protect land in historically and culturally important regions like Barpeta, Majuli, and Batadrava so that only the people from those places can purchase property there.”Sarma said the delimitation exercise last year was a crucial step towards safeguarding the state’s future.On CAA, Sarma mentioned the “limited impact” of the agitation against the law. “Bringing CAA was a brave step by BJP govt.

Proposed bill seeks to make women waqf board members,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/proposed-bill-seeks-to-make-women-waqf-board-members/articleshow/112270799.cms,"NEW DELHI: The proposed amendments to the Waqf Act will include, judicial scrutiny to determine whether a property is a waqf asset and mandatory provision of registration of properties with district collectors for their actual valuation. Another major proposed change will to broad-base the composition of the Central Waqf Council and waqf boards in states by mandating inclusion of two women as members in each of these entities, sources said on Sunday.Government is also considering giving a new name to the law akin to the meaning of ""hope"", sources said. There are 30 waqf boards in the country looking after properties spanning more than 8 lakh acres, which make them the third largest owner of real estate after the ministries of railways and defence.As per the 40 amendments that were cleared by Cabinet on Friday, the entire mechanism for collection of revenue from commercial use of waqf properties and expenditure will be made online, which will bring transparency and benefit the ""poor, children and women"", who hardly get any benefit, sources said. All income from waqf properties are meant to be spent for charity.Rejecting allegations from some sections that govt is trying to take over waqf properties by bringing changes in the law, sources said the proposed amendments will rather ensure the deprived sections get the maximum benefit as there will be proper use of waqf assets for welfare of poor Muslims. They also said while assets will remain with waqf boards, these will be registered properly and there will be proper audits of these entities, stressing that the amendment to allow judicial scrutiny of waqf boards' decisions, are based on the recommendations of the Sachar Committee and K Rahman Khan-led joint parliamentary panel.Sources said govt will establish a framework on how waqf properties should be used so that revenue earned from them are spent for welfare of only poor Muslims.""Despite the waqf boards having more than 8.7 lakh immovable properties, the total revenue is barely Rs 200 crore. These boards are also controlled by only around 200 people. So the need was felt after getting representations from Muslim women and intellectuals to bring the amendments. The instances and numerous allegations of misuse of power by the boards for so many years simply show how urgent it is to amend the law and how we are too late to correct this,"" said a source who did not wish to be named.Though the govt has not yet decided when to introduce the amendment Bill in Parliament, sources did not deny this as well, while mentioning there is little time available in the session to do so.The Waqf Act was first passed by Parliament in 1954. Subsequently, it was repealed and a new Waqf Act was passed in 1995 which gave more powers to waqf boards.In 2013, it was further amended and renamed as Wakf waqf Act to give unlimited powers to the boards to take any property, which even could not be challenged in any court. The Waqf Boards have unlimited powers to claim properties in the name of Muslim charity and even plaintiffs are barred from seeking justice from the judiciary, sources said.Sources said the Union govt gave the land of Muslims who went from India to Pakistan to the Waqf Boards under the Waqf Board Act of 1954. But in 1995, Congress changed the Waqf Board Act to give the boards unlimited rights to acquire land in what was largely seen as an attempt to modify Muslims in the wake of the Babri demolition of 1991.The Congress-led UPA govt again amended the act in 2013.","Proposed amendments to the Waqf Act will include, judicial scrutiny to determine whether a property is a waqf asset and mandatory provision of registration of properties with district collectors for their actual valuation.

""This has established that a consumer has no right to recover money by illegal and defamatory posts misusing social media,"" said Mehta.

VADODARA: Delhi high court has directed a Noida resident and some social media platforms to remove defamatory videos on Amul products. This follows a post by the resident, Deepa Devi, in June claiming she had found a centipede in an Amul vanilla tub purchased from Blinkit, sparking an internet furore.A bench of Justice Manmeet Pritam Singh Arora passed the order recently after lawyers for Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation (AmulFed) -- the maker of Amul products and owner of its brand -- told the high court that the Noida resident had failed to appear before the court despite several notices and opportunities.Jayen Mehta, managing director of GCMMF , called it a ""milestone"" verdict. ""This has established that a consumer has no right to recover money by illegal and defamatory posts misusing social media,"" said Mehta.In an interim order last month, the high court had directed Deepa to take down her posts. Later, the court issued another order, stating that the defamatory content should be removed from all social media platforms, including X, YouTube and Meta. Justice Arora issued the order on July 24 after hearing the lawyers for GCMMF and some social media platforms.The high court had ordered that if the video and the post, or parts of them, are found uploaded on the platforms, they shall all have to be deleted.""Amul shall bring the same to the notice of the social media and the concerned URLs shall be taken down by them within 36 hours,"" the order states.The court observed that the URLs of the posts had already been provided to the counsels for X, YouTube, Meta and other platforms.

ED to return Rs 12 crore scam money to victims,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ed-to-return-rs-12-crore-scam-money-to-victims/articleshow/112271231.cms,"NEW DELHI: Enforcement Directorate is set to start restituting money to victims of scams. It will start with disbursement of nearly Rs 12 crore in attached fixed deposits (FDs) of Rose Valley group of companies in Kolkata to around 22 lakh small depositors who were tempted by the accused companies into depositing money with them by by promising exorbitant returns that never materialised.In a first, a special PMLA court in Kolkata on July 24 asked ED to transfer 14 attached FDs valued at Rs 11.99 crore in the Rose Valley scam to a court monitored Asset Disposal Committee (ADC), ""subject to the conditions that amount shall be disbursed to the bona-fide claimants on pro-rata basis or as may be directed by ADC or by the court"".ED started implementing the order, in keeping with PM Narendra Modi's promise during Lok Sabha campaign to compensate victims of financial crimes by distributing among them accused's assets that have been seized by ED.During the campaign, Modi had said that upon being re-elected, he would explore legal options for restituting the victims of frauds by distributing among them the accused's assets that remain with ED during pendency of the case; often, a long-drawn out process spanning many years which compounds the woes of the duped.The Kolkata court and ED have found a way out in Section 8(8) of PMLA under which attached assets confiscated by ED can be restored to ""a claimant with a legitimate interest in the property, who may have suffered a quantifiable loss as a result of the offence of money laundering"". ED has to prepare panchnama for such transfer of attached property which may be used as evidence during trial, according to the law.Although there is no clarity on the amendments government is planning to bring to help victims, given the PM's focus during the campaign, ED is all set to to use the Kolkata court order as a precedent.The restitution in the Rose Valley case is based on an earlier direction from Calcutta High Court where it had constituted the ADC headed by Justice Dilip Kumar Seth, former judge of Calcutta HC, to sell the assets of the accused company situated in West Bengal in public auction and the sale proceeds to be deposited in a separate account to be opened by the committee. Significantly, the special court, while passing the landmark order, also factored in the possibility of acquittal of the accused, a prospect which is a deterrent for govt's plan to compensate the duped.""I have also taken into account the eventuality, that is to say, suppose the accused are acquitted after trial, and then what will be the effect of such restoration order? The answer is, whatever is the result of the trial, the investors would get their money returned,"" the special court judge said.The order further justified the restitution and said, ""It is appropriate and rational that the money should be utilised in returning the bankrupt investors and depositors instead of keeping it idle as NPA for a prolonged period because the trial in money laundering offence takes time to complete.""","ED will start with disbursement of nearly Rs 12 crore in attached fixed deposits (FDs) of Rose Valley group of companies in Kolkata to around 22 lakh small depositors.

KOZHIKODE: In a different time, 18-year-old hotel management student Abhijith Kallingal would have gone for a long, leisurely stroll in his village of Punchirimattom to capture its lush green hills and waterfalls with his mobile phone, as he did almost every day. But this is now. Sitting in a relief camp in Meppadi's government high school this weekend, he was deleting these cherished photos, unable to bear the memories they evoked.Abhijith's life was shattered when a landslide early Tuesday flattened his village and claimed the lives of his entire family , eight in all - including his parents, siblings, grandmother, uncle, aunt, cousin, and four close neighbours who had sought refuge in his home as it rained nonstop for two days in Wayanad.The teenager survived only because he was away in Thiruvananthapuram for his studies. His once safe and beautiful village, often photographed and shared with friends, became the site of an unimaginable tragedy .Abhijith's home, perceived as safe due to its elevated location, was completely destroyed. All its 12 occupants at the time perished. The bodies of his father, sister, uncle, and aunt were found in the rubble, but his mother, brother, grandmother, and cousin remain missing. Adding to his grief, Abhijith lost an aunt who was visiting relatives in Chooralmala - the site of another devastating landslide.Abhijith is left alone, accompanied only by his cousin Pranav, the sole survivor from his uncle Narayanan's family. Amidst his trauma, Abhijith left the relief camp to perform the last rites of his father and sister at the Mariyammam temple funeral grounds. ""Our village was so beautiful. I had taken so many images. I have deleted most of them. What is the use of keeping them when everything is lost?"" he said.

For instance, they are more prone to dehydration due to their lower ability to regulate body temperature, making them more vulnerable to heat waves and high temperatures. Also climate change may cause crop failures and rising prices, which in turn may lead to increased rates of malnutrition among children.The minister shared the findings of a study done this year by MS Swaminathan Research Foundation (MSSRF). It examines the implications of climate change on women and children across various agro-ecological zones in India and reveals that women and children in Bihar, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal and Telangana are especially vulnerable to climate-related disasters.“Children exposed to climate hazards are more likely to experience stunting, underweight conditions, and increased susceptibility to early pregnancies. According to the study, exposure to drought events raises the likelihood of underweight women by 35%, child marriage by 37%, teenage pregnancy by 17% and intimate partner violence by up to 50%,” she said.On the response to the challenges, the WCD minister said, “The govt recognises the adverse impact of climate change on women and children and has taken several steps to mitigate the vulnerabilities.”Besides the fact that the govt implements the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC), the minister highlighted the National Programme on Climate Change and Human Health (NPCCHH) launched by the health ministry in 2019 to reduce morbidity, mortality, injuries and health vulnerabilities to climate variability and extreme weather events especially among vulnerable groups like women, children and marginalised communities.","The govt on Friday emphasised that it is now globally accepted that the “climate crisis and its impact are not gender-neutral” The minister for women and child development, Annpurna Devi, however, also highlighted that so far, no audit regarding the impact of climate change on women and children has been conducted.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112269643,imgsize-1052452,width-400,resizemode-4/112269643.jpg"

According to the BJP, the suspension of MGNREGA funds, which began on March 9, 2022, is not politically motivated but is a response to financial irregularities uncovered during audits by the central government. These audits, conducted between 2019 and 2021, found substantial misappropriation of funds by the TMC government, amounting to Rs 537.05 lakh, which prompted the central government to recommend recovery.""TMC’s habitual engagement in duplicity and capriciousness is once again laid bare through the mendacious tweet by Derek O’Brien. In his attempt to hoodwink the innocent voters of Bengal, he blamed the Central Govt for failing to release funds under MGNREGA,"" BJP said in a post on X.The BJP said that the TMC’s responses, including an Action Taken Report submitted in June 2019, have been inadequate. The state’s continued non-compliance led to the invocation of Section 27 of the MGNREGA Act, justifying the fund stoppage. As of July 25, 2024, the central government reiterated its request for updates on recovery and disciplinary actions, noting that only Rs 161.64 lakh of the misappropriated funds have been recovered.""It is high time for TMC to finally accept their involvement in the debacle and take action against the Chief of the Loot - Mamata Banerjee!"" the saffron party said.O’Brien's claimed the Modi government has admitted in Parliament that West Bengal received ""zero"" funds under MGNREGA. He cited a reply from the Union minister of state for rural development, Kamlesh Paswan, which showed zero households completed 100 days of employment in 2023-24. However, the data also indicated that 1,618 households completed the work in 2022-23, and 4,71,136 in 2021-22, before the funding halt.""Finally! Modi Govt admits inside Parliament that BENGAL'S BEEN GIVEN ZERO for MNREGA funds,"" the TMC MP said in his post on X.The BJP's accusations came on a day when the West Bengal Governor CV Ananda Bose Governor said there were loopholes in the financial management of West Bengal.

KRS Dam: KRS Dam Records 4th Highest Outflow in History,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/krs-dam-records-4th-highest-outflow-in-history/articleshow/112209184.cms,"We also published the following articles recently

Inflow to KRS crosses 1 lakh cusecs; Hemavathi dam receives 53,000 cusecs

The KRS dam witnessed a significant increase in water inflow due to heavy rainfall in the Malnad districts. Authorities released more water from the dam to manage the rising levels, leading to a flood-like situation in Mysuru and Mandya. The Hemavathi River also flooded several villages and towns in the Hassan district, disrupting daily life and transport.

High alert as 1.7L cusecs of water flows out of Mettur dam

The discharge from Mettur dam was increased to 1.7 lakh cusecs due to heavy inflow from Karnataka. District authorities were instructed to take precautionary measures for the flood situation in the Cauvery. Relief camps were set up, and residents near the river were evacuated. Measures were also taken to handle landslides in the Nilgiris.

Flooding worsens as excess water is released from KRS, Kabini dams

Authorities released 1.5 lakh cusecs of water from KRS dam and 50,000 cusecs from Kabini dam, worsening the flood situation in Mysuru, Mandya, and Chamarajanagar districts. Eight villages were notified as flood-affected. Schools were closed, and entry to several tourist spots was banned. Bridges and temples were submerged, and several relief camps were set up for affected families.

Mysuru/ Mandya: The KRS dam has scripted history this monsoon season. Wednesday’s release of 1,72,161 cusecs to the river from the KRS dam located in Srirangapatna in Mandya district was the fourth highest ever outflow from the reservoir since it was built.According to the Cauvery Neeravari Nigama Limited (CNNL), the highest ever outflow from the dam was 2.13 lakh cusecs recorded in 1961.Thirty years later, in 1991, the dam recorded its second highest ever outflow of 2.11 lakhs cusecs, which was largely attributed to flash floods. The third highest outflow was recorded in the year 1964 with 1.9 lakhs cusecs. Wednesday’s outflow was the fourth highest outflow, explained officials.However, the outflow has been reduced to 1.3 lakh on Thursday as the inflow dipped a wee bit.The inflow and outflow at all the four major dams in the Cauvery basin in the state have come down significantly easing the flood situation.

Willie Brown: Who is Willie Brown? What role did Kamala Harris’ former lover play in her career?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-willie-brown-what-role-did-kamala-harris-former-lover-play-in-her-career/articleshow/112168665.cms,"Kamala’s Way: An American Life

Willie Brown's Role in Kamala Harris' Career

Willie Brown's Political Legacy

Kamala Harris , during her early career as a prosecutor, was involved in a relationship with Willie Brown , a powerful Democratic figure who was 60 years old at the time and serving as Speaker of the California State Assembly. Their relationship began in 1994, when Harris was 29. According to Dean Morain's 2021 book, Brown showered Harris with gifts, including a BMW, trips to Paris, and attendance at prestigious events like the Academy Awards.According to a report in the New York Post, he also took her on a business trip to Boston, where he was meeting with Donald Trump .The relationship between Harris and Brown was well-known in San Francisco. The San Francisco Chronicle referred to Harris as ""the speaker’s new steady,"" while the Los Angeles Times described her as Brown’s ""frequent companion."" In November 1994, near the end of his term as Speaker, Brown appointed Harris—then working in the Alameda County District Attorney’s office—to the California Medical Assistance Commission, a position that paid $72,000 annually and required monthly meetings.Brown, now 90, has acknowledged his role in Harris's political ascent. In a 2019 opinion piece, he confirmed their relationship and noted his influence in her career, including appointing her to two state commissions and supporting her first run for San Francisco District Attorney. These days, he often jokes that if she became president, she would 'deport his a**'.Willie Brown played a pivotal role in Kamala Harris' early political career by providing key opportunities, mentorship, and connections. As Speaker of the California Assembly, he appointed her to state boards, which gave her valuable experience and financial stability. Brown also introduced Harris to influential figures and donors in San Francisco's elite circles, helping to build her network and support base. His deep knowledge of California politics and strategic guidance were invaluable to Harris as she navigated her career. Brown's public endorsements further bolstered her credibility, aiding her successful bid for San Francisco District Attorney in 2003. Overall, his influence and support were instrumental in Harris' rise through the political ranks.Willie Brown is a prominent American politician who has been a key figure in California's political landscape for decades. Born on March 20, 1934, in Mineola, Texas, Brown moved to San Francisco in 1951, where he pursued higher education and eventually earned a law degree from the University of California, Hastings College of the Law.Brown began his political career in the early 1960s, losing his first run for the California State Assembly in 1962 but winning in 1964. He served in the Assembly for over 30 years, becoming its longest-serving Speaker from 1980 to 1995. Known for his sharp political acumen and negotiation skills, Brown was a key figure in state politics, often described as one of the most powerful state legislators in the country. His tenure as Speaker was marked by his ability to navigate complex political landscapes, maintaining control even in challenging circumstances, such as when Democrats lost the majority in the Assembly in the mid-1990s.In addition to his legislative career, Brown served as the first African American mayor of San Francisco from 1996 to 2004. His time as mayor was marked by both controversy and praise, particularly for his efforts to revitalize parts of the city and his influence over local and state politics.Brown has been a mentor to many political figures, including Vice President Kamala Harris. His influence extended beyond his official roles, often acting as a kingmaker within the Democratic Party.After retiring from public office, Brown continued his involvement in public life, establishing the Willie L. Brown, Jr. Institute on Politics and Public Service in 2008, aimed at training future municipal leaders. Despite his retirement, he remains an influential figure in California politics.Brown's personal life also attracted attention; he was married to Blanche Vitero, with whom he has three children, though they separated in 1976. He also has a daughter, Sydney Brown, from a later relationship. Throughout his career, Brown has been recognized with numerous honors, including honorary degrees from various institutions, reflecting his lasting impact on public service and politics in California.","Willie Brown was the Speaker of the California State Assembly from 1980 to 1995.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
'Just give me my money' TikTok trend explained: Why it's taking over social media,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/tiktok-trend-just-give-me-my-money-becomes-latest-social-media-sensation/articleshow/112274496.cms,"In the ever-evolving world of TikTok trends, a new viral sensation , the “Just Give Me My Money” trend is sweeping across the platform, leaving both participants and viewers in stitches.The trend's premise is refreshingly simple yet irresistibly entertaining. Participants gather in a circle or line and each takes turns saying the phrase “just give me my money” in an exaggerated, comical voice.As the phrase is uttered, the rest of the group showers the speaker with enthusiastic applause. However, the humor comes into play when an unsuspecting participant, who is not in on the joke, says the phrase and is met with dead silence and no applause.The prank’s charm lies in its unpredictability and the often hilarious reactions of the unprepared participant.One of the most talked-about instances of the trend involved none other than Will Smith. In a recent video, Smith's “Fresh Prince of Bel-Air” co-stars orchestrated a playful prank, remaining silent and walking away after he delivered the phrase. The result was a bewildered Smith, whose confused reaction only added to the trend’s viral appeal.The origins of the “Just Give Me My Money” trend are somewhat murky, but many attribute its inception to popular streamer Kai Cenat.During a January 2024 livestream with rapper DreamDoll, Cenat is believed to have introduced the phrase, which bears a striking resemblance to a scene from the 2002 film Paid in Full. In the movie, the phrase is repeated several times, potentially sparking the initial idea for the trend.","The prank’s charm lies in its unpredictability and the often hilarious reactions of the unprepared participant.

I have heard from authoritative sources of hundreds of people arriving in Canada with valid visitor's visas and applying for asylum soon after landing in Canada. While we should continue to support genuine refugee claimants, we should strictly deal with those who are misusing and gaming our generous refugee system."", Arya added in his postAccording to a report in the Toronto Star, Canada's largest independent tribunal received 1,38,000 new claims for refugee status in 2023, rising by 129 per cent from 2022 and by 136 per cent in 2019, Canada stares at 1,86,000 cases in the queue, as 46,700 claims were lodged by the end of March 2024.""It didn't take long for me to realize with the team that we needed to maintain our ability to render fair decisions despite the growing intake. We need to do something about that, "" the Toronto Star quotedManon Brassard , the chairperson of the Immigration and Refugee Board in 2023 as having told a Senate committee in June.The report added that in the spring session of the Canadian parliament, the federal government tried to bring an omnibus bill to tackle the backlog and streamline the process. But, it failed to pass. Critics say the board needs more decision makers and the government must take some people out of the queue and give them other alternatives.Immigration lawyer Maureen Silcoff told the Toronto Star that Canada can offer immigration status to asylum seekers who are employed in fields with labour shortages .

His initial reaction was confusion, as there was no apparent panic among the passengers.In a subsequent interview with the People, Judelson described the scene, noting that the woman’s rush seemed overly dramatic for the situation. He and another passenger wondered why she was so frantic, since everyone would be deplaning together.Judelson recounted, “I look around, no one’s on the ground, no one’s freaking out. I’m like, ‘it can’t be that dire.'” Upon landing, the situation became more peculiar. “As soon as we land, this woman across the aisle from me shoots up and rushes to the front of the plane,” he ewas quoted as explaing, noting that it seemed like an exaggerated urgency to be the first off the aircraft.The situation grew even stranger when passengers were told they would face a 12-hour delay and were given hotel vouchers. Judelson’s confusion deepened as he questioned whether they were stuck in Phoenix indefinitely.American Airlines confirmed in a statement that the flight was diverted due to a medical emergency. However, the specifics remained unclear until Judelson learned through word of mouth that the real cause was a lice outbreak. He overheard other passengers discussing how bugs had been spotted in the woman's hair, prompting the emergency landing.Despite the unusual interruption, passengers eventually continued their journey to New York, albeit with an unexpected detour.","A flight from Los Angeles to New York was forced to make an emergency landing in Phoenix.

Commitment to swift action

In a bold declaration during a recent Fox News interview, former President Donald Trump referred to America's untapped energy resources as "" liquid gold ,"" asserting that the United States has more energy potential than any other nation, including Saudi Arabia and Russia . He promised to harness these resources to make the US energy-dominant on the world stage.""We have more energy — we have more liquid gold, as I call it, under our feet than Saudi Arabia, than Russia, than anybody,"" Trump was quoted as saying.""We're going to be energy-dominant, we're going to make a fortune, we're going to supply it all over Europe, all over the world,"" Trump said.

""We're going to get energy way down. Drill, baby, drill,"" he said, emphasizing that reducing energy costs would help address broader economic challenges.Beyond energy, Trump laid out an aggressive plan to revive the American auto industry, which he claims has been significantly eroded by foreign competition. He pledged to bring back auto jobs through a tariff system designed to encourage domestic production and penalize countries like China and Mexico, which he says have ""stolen"" US manufacturing jobs.""Those people in Michigan that love me and that I love, they're going to give us a victory because their auto industry won't exist in two years if she [Harris] gets elected,"" Trump warned, predicting a dire future for the industry under current policies.

California nurse claims discrimination after being asked to leave Southwest flight over skin condition,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/california-nurse-claims-discrimination-after-being-asked-to-leave-southwest-flight-over-skin-condition/articleshow/112270737.cms,"Woman unfairly kicked off Southwest flight due to medical condition

Brianna Solari , a nurse from Roseville, California, said that she faced a distressing situation when she was asked to leave a Southwest Airlines flight over her skin condition.Solari explained that she lacks a certain enzyme, neurofibromin , which is a tumor suppressor . ""I lack an enzyme, which is neurofibromin, which is a tumor suppressor. So tumors grow along nerves and can be tiny, little pinpoint tumors, or they can be enormous.Some of them can be very disfiguring,” the nurse told KCRA.After its removal on Wednesday, Solari was prepared to fly back to Sacramento the next day on Southwest Flight 3471 at 12.10 pm (local time).Upon boarding the flight, a crew member allegedly asked her to step off the plane, reported the New York Post.“I exited the airplane, and they said there had been some concerns,” Solari recounted. “‘Do you have any, you know, medical conditions, or diseases?’ And I said, no, I had surgery,” she explained to KCRA. “That’s none of their business what’s going on. But I said, no, I had surgery. And they said, ‘OK.'”The crewmember also called a doctor contracted with the airline, but prevented Solari from speaking directly with the physician.Throughout the incident, Solari said that she experienced a range of emotions, feeling ""Humiliated, embarrassed, ashamed? It's already hard enough. It's already difficult enough with this condition because I did have some visible tumors on my face and my arms, and people would comment.""After missing her original flight, Solari had to obtain a letter from her surgeon clearing her to fly after which she was placed on a new flight back to Sacramento. However, this did not change her feelings toward the airline. “I don’t think I’ll ever fly them again. I think this could have been handled much more professionally,” Solari said. “They should have waited until they had all of the information before making a decision that ultimately impacted my day, my flight, my traveling, and my overall perspective on Southwest has changed.”Southwest Airlines issued an apology and in a statement to the Post said, ""We are disheartened to learn of the Customer's experience flying with us and extend our deepest apologies for the inconvenience."" “Even though our team ultimately received clearance for the customer to travel, we weren’t able to do so in time for the flight’s departure. We rebooked her on a later flight, offered a travel voucher for a future flight along with a meal voucher, and we’re following up with her directly to discuss the situation,"" the Airline spokesperson further said.The airline offered Solari a $500 flight voucher and a $45 meal voucher, but she is still considering legal action, according to KCRA.Solari believes the situation was discriminatory and violated her medical privacy , asserting, ""This is absolutely discrimination !

Non-profit organisation CEO Sarah Kate Ellis faces criticism over spending and IRS concerns,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/non-profit-organisation-ceo-sarah-kate-ellis-faces-criticism-over-spending-and-irs-concerns/articleshow/112269040.cms,"LGBTQ advocacy non-profit organisation GLAAD’s CEO Sarah Kate Ellis is facing criticism over extravagant spending on travel, accommodation, and office renovations revealed by a New York Times report .The report also raised concerns about potential IRS violations . Covering expenses from January 2022 to June 2023, the report highlighted first-class flights, stays at luxurious hotels, and a $20,000 home-office remodel that included ivory pillows and a chandelier.Ellis, who earns approximately $700,000 annually, allegedly utilized at least $18,000 of a $20,000 allotment to renovate her home office in Long Island.This revamp aimed to make the space “suitable” for television appearances and virtual events, as claimed by a GLAAD spokesperson. However, GLAAD reportedly did not declare these renovation costs as income on Ellis' tax forms, based on legal advice, potentially violating IRS rules.Additionally, other lavish expenses flagged were hotel stays at high-end properties like the Waldorf Astoria and a $15,000 summer rental in Cape Cod. The seasonal rental was defended as a business expense since it facilitated Ellis in raising millions of dollars during a typically slow fundraising season.Last year, these expenditures alarmed GLAAD’s then-Chief Financial Officer, Emily Plauche, who believed they conflicted with the organization's policies and were not adequately disclosed to the IRS.In response to the allegations, GLAAD defended the spending, with the chair of its board of directors expressing firm support for Ellis. Ellis herself said, ""I take my role as GLAAD's financial steward incredibly seriously, and we'll continue updating our procedures to keep pace with the organization's rapid growth."" She also emphasized the urgency of GLAAD's work, citing the increasing attacks on the LGBTQ community, according to the Hollywood Reporter.The organization defended the expenses and criticized the Times for utilizing ""significant resources to spin a negative story"", reported the New York Post.GLAAD has been openly critical of the Times' coverage of transgender people. In response, the Times maintained that their article was ""fair, accurate and based on objective information in GLAAD’s expense reports, employment contracts, tax filings, and other documents.""After an investigation conducted by a law firm into these concerns, GLAAD reportedly revised its travel policies.Established in 1985, GLAAD is a non-profit organization dedicated to advocating for the LGBTQ community and promoting cultural change. As the leading global media advocacy organization for the ""Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer (LGBTQ)"" community, GLAAD works to enhance media accountability and foster community engagement, according to the organisation's website.The non-profit strives to ensure that authentic LGBTQ stories are ""seen, heard, and actualized"" across various media platform and collaborates with media outlets, content creators, and community members.","GLAAD CEO Sarah Kate Ellis is facing criticism over extravagant spending on travel, accommodation, and office renovations revealed by a New York Times report.
