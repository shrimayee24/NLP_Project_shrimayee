"Renowned poet, ex-R&AW officer Keki Daruwalla passes away",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/renowned-poet-ex-raw-officer-keki-daruwalla-passes-away/articleshow/113755207.cms,"NEW DELHI: Keki N Daruwalla, one of the foremost poets of post-independent India, who also donned the mantle of a cop and intelligence officer with equal felicity, passed away in a hospital on Thursday. He was 87.""He suffered a stroke a year ago and wasn't keeping well. But it wasn't a stroke this time. He died of pneumonia,"" his daughter Anaheita Kapadia told PTI.Born in Lahore to a Parsi family, Daruwalla’s collections of poems include, ""Under Orion"" and ""The Keeper of the Dead"", which earned him the Sahitya Akademi Award in 1984.In 2015, he returned the award as a protest against the Akademi’s inability to stand up boldly against rising intolerance against writers. His ""Landscapes"" received the Commonwealth Poetry Award, Asia, in 1987. In a press release on Friday, the Sahitya Akademi described him as “one of the greatest poets of modern India”Poet and professor Ashwani Kumar said that Daruwalla enjoyed an “edge over his contemporaries like Nissim Ezekiel, A K Ramanujan, and Jayanta Mahapatra in social awareness of history and the mastery over emotional immediacy of language. He redefined the land and landscape of Indian poetry in English.”A recipient of Padma Shri in 2014, Daruwalla’s work was translated into various languages ranging including Spanish, Swedish, German and Russian. Sahitya Akademi recipient writer Mridula Garg said that the poet loved life and history with equal passion. “Both combined to give his poetry a special cadence and a sense of adventure. The present and the past were intermixed in a way that enthralled the reader as a participant in the history of even those he did not know intimately,” she said.Harish Trivedi, former professor of English in Delhi University, said that as a poet, Daruwalla was as deeply engaged with current political and social issues as he was with the ancient civilisations of Persia and Greece. “He also had a fine sense of metre and rhythm which is now so rare,” he said.Daruwalla’s demise drew tributes from a wide spectrum of prominent people. In a post on social media, Congress politician Jairam Ramesh pointed out that the poet was also “a distinguished IPS officer of the 1958 batch and had spent much time in India's intelligence establishment, including R&AW…Tremendously witty and always with a smile, he spoke truth to power at all times. A man of great compassion and empathy, he reflected all that is noble in our syncretic culture.”","Keki N Daruwalla, one of the foremost poets of post-independent India, passed away in a hospital on Thursday.

Meet the Wolf of WhatsApp,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/meet-the-wolf-of-whatsapp/articleshow/113743565.cms,"Thirukkural

with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres.

Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece.

“Nanrari vaaril Kayavar Thiruvudayar





Nenjaththu Avalam Ilar”

One afternoon, my phone rang from an unknown number. The caller, claiming to be from the Mumbai Police’s Narcotics Control Wing, had my Aadhaar and PAN details. He accused me of having a consignment linked to narcotics, saying an arrest warrant had been issued in my name. To make his story more convincing, he asked me to accept a video call to show the warrant and mentioned I would be placed under “digital arrest”.Scam calls are now part of daily life. They often begin with an automated message, claiming to be from a govt agency, warning that your phone will be disconnected unless you speak to an “officer”. Once connected, the scammer uses fear and urgency to cause panic, manipulating emotions to drive victims into transferring funds out of sheer anxiety.Another common scam involves phishing emails or messages posing as legitimate banks, prompting you to click links for rewards or refunds. These links install malware, giving scammers remote access to your device. They can steal money and intercept OTPs, leaving you helpless. These operations are run by tech-savvy fraudsters, often based in call centres across the country, while the masterminds remain in safe havens abroad.Scammers impersonate officials from credible organisations such as tax departments, TRAI, customs or the police, using words like “digital arrest” to create panic. Desperate victims transfer money to avoid arrest. In Delhi NCR alone, scammers swindled up to ₹120 crore between June and August.Stolen money is laundered through “layering” or moving between accounts to evade tracking. While some call centres have been busted, the complexity of these networks — scattered victims, accounts and scammers — makes it challenging to eliminate the problem. As long as people fall for these schemes, fraudsters will continue refining their tactics.Swindlers have long preyed on human vulnerabilities, exploiting emotions and bypassing rational thought. History offers many examples.In 300 BC, Greek merchant Hegestratos tried to sink his ship to avoid repaying a loan. In the 17th century, British conman Gregor MacGregor sold fictitious land to wealthy investors. Jeanne de Valois tricked a French Cardinal into buying jewellery for Queen Marie Antoinette, which she stole herself. Victor Lustig ‘sold’ the Eiffel Tower twice, while Charles Ponzi’s schemes netted $65 billion. India’s Natwarlal famously “sold” the Taj Mahal, Red Fort and Parliament.I often wonder — do these fraudsters feel no remorse, or has guilt simply evaporated?Psychologists believe that many fraudsters don’t feel guilty about their actions. They use a mental process called “neutralisation”, where they justify their deeds by thinking, “These people can afford it, and I need the money more than they do.” A sense of entitlement, combined with the thrill of outsmarting others, drives these individuals. Manipulating people becomes a source of inner gratification.Interestingly, even the ancient Tamil poet Thiruvalluvar addressed this mindset centuries ago. In his work, he observed sarcastically that cheats live without guilt, while honest people constantly question themselves, burdened by their conscience.Happier than men of conscience are these fraudsters,For they never have any pangs of guilt.“Madam, are you there? A consignment with drugs has been shipped under your name,” said the man on the other end.Feigning anxiety, I played along. “Oh, you caught my consignment? Ketamine or cocaine?”After a brief silence, I added, “You have my Aadhaar, right? Just come and arrest me at home. I am waiting.”The line went dead, and I smiled.My daughter will be proud of me as I borrowed the last line from a Vijay movie.","Bharathi Bhaskar explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’ Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113743619,imgsize-77150,width-1000,height-562,resizemode-75/113743619.jpg"

SRINAGAR: If a roller coaster was to morph into life, it would likely be Kashmiri. And, possibly Fayyaz Ganai .The youngster from Kupwara flew on govt's ""Udaan"" scheme to make a life in Kolkata but jolted by the post-Pulwama backlash, Article 370 shutdown and Covid lockdown he never could quite settle down. Coming to Kashmir for safety and forced to Kolkata by circumstances, he was resigned to his fate.Only to be finally back home to become a chef. His story is symbolic of other Kashmiris since 2019.""I don't know how the five years went by,"" says Fayyaz.It is difficult to imagine a more soothing setting in life - the scenic Dal lakefront, milling tourists haggling with eager locals hawking their craft, Kashmiri cuisine adding to their delight, its aroma wafting through the warmth of the day and nip of the night. All forming the mystique of what is Kashmir.But Fayyaz was anxious and searching. A computer operator at a gas agency in Kupwara, he imagined a life beyond the backwaters when, through ""Udaan"", he was recruited by a software giant for its insurance back-office in Kolkata in 2017. The next two years were what he had longed for, till the Pulwama attacks in February 2019 turned his world upside down.""There were attacks on Kashmiris selling shawls in Bengal. My family was worried and asked me to return,"" he said.Fayyaz played smart. As employers understood the pressure on Kashmiris, he flew to Srinagar, and quietly started a restaurant of local delicacies. He used the pretext of marriage to extend his stay and weighed his options.And, just when he felt he could quit the Kolkata job, his world was shattered again on Aug 5, 2019, with the abrogation of Article 370. Kashmir was shut down, the tourist flow stopped. He defaulted on EMIs on a Rs 3 lakh loan taken to set up the restaurant.Desperate, but with considerate employers, Fayyaz returned to Bengal in Oct. But his concerned parents kept nudging him to come back.Hope soared again three months later when basic internet was restored and curfew lifted in Kashmir. ""I resigned on a three-month notice period,"" he recalled. His mind was set on being a quality chef in Srinagar, catering to the taste buds of tourists he imagined flocking to Kashmir again.Again, it was not to be. Covid struck with a nationwide lockdown in March 2020. A hapless Fayyaz took back his resignation. ""I was stranded in Kolkata, and worked from home,"" he recalled.Aided by a scheme to repatriate stranded workers, he returned to Srinagar on WFH for his Kolkata office, and did the remote work till Oct 2022. But this time, he used the stay at home to simultaneously learn the exquisite ""wazwan"" from his brother-in-law, a professional chef. He had his mind made up now. He resigned from his Kolkata job, and made Srinagar his home.Fayyaz has since picked up pieces and put his life together. It has had its ups and downs, more downs than ups. The post-Covid revenge tourism saw an uptick in local and inter-state footfall in 2021, and a solid boom in 2022. But since then, it has been on a slide, with losses mounting.Back home in Kupwara, he has old parents saddled with slip disc, with a monthly medical expenditure of Rs 12,000, and a sister to sustain. His brother Tariq is studying and helps him in the restaurant.Since, the genial young man is hopeful that in future, tourists will be a consistent feature, normalcy would be permanent, and he would see good days. And, just as he had done, Fayyaz is planning to send Tariq out to make a life in Delhi. But, he prays, with better luck.","Fayyaz Ganai flew on govt's ""Udaan"" scheme to make a life in Kolkata.

Nandini Ghee: The new ghee supplier for Tirupati laddus – who owns it?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nandini-the-new-ghee-supplier-for-tirupati-laddus-who-owns-it/articleshow/113669912.cms,"Image source: KMF Nandini

Nandini: A popular household name in South India

The origins of

Karnataka Milk Federation

(KMF)

How KMF functions today

NEW DELHI: The Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam ( TTD ) has appointed ‘ Nandini ’ as the new ghee supplier, with the supply order already issued to the company. The Andhra Pradesh government took this action amid controversy over the alleged adulteration of laddus at the Tirupati temple, following claims of the use of animal fat and other substances.‘Nandini’ is a well-known brand in South India, similar to the popularity of Amul and Mother Dairy products in North India.It is Karnataka’s biggest milk brand and is also recognised in neighbouring states like Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Maharashtra, and Goa. The ‘Nandini’ brand is owned by the Karnataka Cooperative Milk Producers’ Federation Limited ( KMF ), the second-largest dairy cooperative in India, after Gujarat’s Amul.The current managing director and CEO of KMF is Karnataka administrative service officer MK Jagdish.KMF’s history dates back to 1955, when the first dairy cooperative was established in the Kodagu district of Karnataka. At that time, there was no system of packaged milk, and farmers delivered milk directly to households. There was also a shortage of milk. It wasn't until the 1970s, during India’s ‘White Revolution,’ that efforts to increase milk production took hold, supported by World Bank projects.In 1974, the Karnataka government created the Karnataka Dairy Development Corporation (KDCC) to implement these dairy projects. By 1984, KDCC was renamed the Karnataka Milk Federation, and it began selling packaged milk and other products under the brand name ‘Nandini.’ Over time, ‘Nandini’ grew into Karnataka’s most popular dairy brand and expanded to neighbouring states.KMF operates 15 dairy unions throughout Karnataka, including the Bengaluru, Kolar, and Mysore Cooperative Milk Unions. These unions buy milk from village-level Dairy Cooperative Societies (DCS) and deliver it to KMF for processing. According to the Karnataka Milk Federation’s website, KMF purchases over 86 lakh kilos of milk daily from 26 lakh farmers in 24,000 villages.One of KMF’s standout features is its daily payment system for milk suppliers, who are mainly small farmers and producers. The federation distributes more than Rs 28 crore in daily payments. KMF has 15 units that process and package milk, which is then sold through various channels.","‘Nandini’ is a well-known brand in South India, similar to the popularity of Amul and Mother Dairy products in North India.

Water shortage in Bengaluru: Tanker bill per house goes up to Rs 25k here,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/water-shortage-in-bengaluru-tanker-bill-per-house-goes-up-to-rs-25k-here/articleshow/113683003.cms,"The situation has escalated to the point where families are outbidding each other to get tankers to oblige to their demand.

BENGALURU: Residents of Kamadhenu Layout in Mahadevapura have been grappling with severe water shortage for over 18 months now, forcing them to rely on very few private water tankers to meet their daily needs. The situation has escalated to the point where families are outbidding each other to get tankers to oblige to their demand, and each household is spending anywhere between Rs 10,000 and Rs 25,000 every month on water.BWSSB officials attribute the delay in addressing the issue to the pending activation of Cauvery Stage 5.Rishabh Aditya, a software engineer and new father, shared the difficulties faced by his family due to irregular water supply. ""I have an infant at home, and water has become a top priority for us. We need it for cooking, cleaning, and giving warm baths to the baby. Unfortunately, we receive no support from BWSSB, and we are forced to rely on tankers,"" he said.Aditya described the frustration of having to stay awake until late at night to ensure water delivery. ""Tankers supply water based on who books first. With more than 100 people in the layout, we often have to wait until 1am, which is exhausting,"" he said.The cost of water from tankers varies, with residents paying anywhere between Rs 1,500 and Rs 4,000 for a 5,000-litre load. For larger families, the expenses quickly add up. Naveenchandra Keshavmurthy, another resident, shared that his household spends Rs 20,000 to Rs 35,000 each month on water. ""We are in absolute misery because of the lack of BWSSB water supply. Despite our complaints, nothing has been done,"" he maintained.Senior citizens living in the area are also feeling the pinch, especially those who rely on pension and savings. Jaishankar V, an elderly resident, expressed concern over the financial strain caused by the ongoing crisis. ""It is painful for us, especially those who are retired. Depending on tankers every day is draining our savings, and monthly costs are overwhelming just for basic water supply,"" he lamented.Venkateshwar, a local tanker owner, said the challenges faced by operators in sourcing and supplying water to the area. ""There is a huge demand for water here, and it is difficult for us to source enough to meet everyone's needs. We charge reasonable rates, but residents still complain.""The residents approached BWSSB officials multiple times, but have only received assurances. According to BWSSB chairman Ram Prasath Manohar, the delay is due to the pending release of Cauvery Stage 5 water. ""These layouts, including Kamadhenu, were developed in 110 villages, and water supply was not originally allocated for them. However, in a few weeks, they will receive water from BWSSB. We are working to address the tanker mafia problem in the area,"" he said.","Residents of Kamadhenu Layout in Mahadevapura have been grappling with severe water shortage for over 18 months now.

'Belong to community of humanity'

Reddy is anti-Hindu, says TDP spokesperson



Reddy defends ghee tender process



'Adulterated ghee was not used'



(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: YSRCP chief Jagan Mohan Reddy on Friday lashed out at the TDP government in Andhra Pradesh, stating that "" demons are now in power in the state"" as he had ""never seen political parties creating hurdles even to make a visit to a temple"".The former CM launched the attack after he cancelled his trip to Tirumala temple amid the Tirupati laddu row. Reddy was scheduled to reach Tirumala on Friday night and visit the temple for darshan on Saturday.Hours before his departure from Tadepalle to Tirupati, Jagan decided to cancel his trip amid growing demands for giving 'declaration of faith' and security concerns.YSRCP had alleged that the state police, under orders from Chandrababu Naidu and minister Nara Lokesh, had issued warnings to YSRCP leaders ahead of Reddy's visit, instructing them not to participate.After cancelling his trip, Reddy held a press conference in which he said that the cops were ""issuing notices to YSRCP leaders and cadres in the wake of my Tirumala visit"".""Police clearly stated in the notices to YSRCP leaders that visit to Tirumala has no permission ... why do we need police permission to visit Temple?"" Reddy said, adding that ""demons are ruling"" the state.""The demon rule is continuing in the state. The government is trying to obstruct my upcoming visit to the Tirumala temple. Police have issued notices to YSRCP leaders across the state regarding the temple visit. The notice states that the visit to the Tirumala temple is not permitted, and the program organised by YSRCP does not have the necessary approval. Consequently, leaders are not allowed to participate in that programme,"" said the YSRCP chief.""On one side, they are serving notices to obstruct my temple visit, while on the other side, BJP cadres are coming into the state from elsewhere, and a large number of police are deployed at multiple locations. I don't know if the BJP leadership is aware of this. To shift the political focus, CM Chandrababu Naidu has brought up the laddu issue. CM Chandrababu Naidu is portraying that animal fat was used in the laddu prasadam manufacturing, which questions the sanctity and pride of Tirumala. Is this justified? Chandrababu Naidu is blatantly lying on TTD Laddu Prasadam,"" the former chief minister told the media after cancelling his trip.The YSRCP chief had said he would visit the temple on September 28 as part of a statewide temple rituals called for by the party to atone for the 'sin' allegedly committed by CM Naidu through his allegations on Tirupati laddus.""What happened during the so-called controversy on Laddus? TTD's reputation has been lowered by Chandrababu Naidu. The pride of our Laddus was diminished by Chandrababu Naidu. He intentionally planted a seed of doubt that the Laddus were not good to eat, even though he knew very well that he was lying,"" said Reddy.On the matter of 'declaration of faith', Reddy said CM Naidu had come up with 'faith declaration' issue to divert attention from failure to convince people on Tirupati laddu quality.He further said: ""Many questions have been raised about my caste. I read the Bible at home, and I respect and follow Hinduism, Islam, and Sikhism. I belong to the community of humanity. What does the Constitution say? If a person equivalent to the Chief Minister is not allowed into the temple, I question how Dalits will be treated.""Reacting to Reddy's charges, TDP national spokesperson Pattabhi Ram Kommareddy, said: ""By cancelling his trip to Tirumala, Jagan Reddy has once again proved that he is anti-Hindu. The only thing that he had to do to have a darshan of Lord Balaji was to sign a declaration, which is a rule in TTD for more than three decades. Any person belonging to a religion other than Hindu is supposed to sign a small declaration and he has to take permission from the concerned authority to have a darshan of Lord Balaji. So what problem does Jagan Reddy have in signing this declaration? Even people like Dr APJ Abdul Kalam, who visited Tirmala as President of this country had signed this declaration because he is a Muslim. Many other eminent leaders in our country have done this... Without having faith and reverence towards Lord Balaji, What will you do by having a darshan of the deity? What kind of drama are you trying to play, Jagan Reddy? On one hand, you say that you'll have the darshan of Lord Balaji and pray for forgiveness for what had happened. It is an unforgivable sin. Lord Balaji will never forgive you.""Defending the ghee procuring process, Reddy said: ""CM Chandrababu Naidu is telling lies. The ghee procurement e-tender is a routine process that has been happening for decades, every 6 months. Tirupati Laddu is very special. Since my childhood, I know that it is very special. The tender process takes place every 6 months, it's a routine. It has been happening for years. Anyone who qualifies can participate.""""Every 6 months, tenders (for Laddu) are called and the one who quotes for lower prices, gets approved by the TTD board. There is no government interference. The TTD board is also very special. Union Ministers and other state CMs also recommend the board members. The tenders of TTD were called as per routine and the suppliers were given as per the tender auction. TTD has a robust mechanism. The tankers that come to Thirumala should have an NABL certificate. The suppliers should get the tankers certified and produce the certificate,"" said the former CM.""During Chandrababu Naidu regime from 2014 to 2019 nearly 14-15 times, the ghee was rejected due to quality issues. There is a robust process. Similarly from 2019 to 2024, 18 times it was rejected and sent back. Whatever I am saying is all facts,"" Reddy added.""Four tankers failed the test in July during Chandrababu Naidu's regime in 2024. The samples from those tankers should have been sent to CFTRI Mysore, but instead, they were sent to NDDB in Gujarat for the first time. TTD issued a show-cause notice to the company responsible for the refused tankers. The refused tanker material was not used by TTD, yet Chandrababu Naidu claims that adulterated ghee was used. I question how adulterated ghee could have been used in prasad manufacturing if the tankers were sent back?"" Reddy said.""The TTD Executive Officer, recruited by Chandrababu Naidu, confirmed on July 23 that vegetable fat oil that is Vanaspati Oil was involved and a show-cause notice was issued to the suppliers. The TTD EO later confirmed on September 20 that adulterated ghee was not used for making Laddu prasadam. Chandrababu Naidu, even after EO submitted the reports, is spreading false allegations about our party and on Hindu sentiments and questions about the sanctity of Tirumala prasad and temple,"" said Reddy.","YSRCP chief Jagan Mohan Reddy lashed out at the TDP government in Andhra Pradesh.

NEW DELHI: UK prime minister Keir Starmer has added his voice to a growing chorus for India's inclusion as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council ( UNSC ).""We want to see permanent African representation on the Council, Brazil, India, Japan and Germany as permanent members, and more seats for elected members as well,"" Starmer said in his address to the 79th session of the UN General Assembly held in New York.Emphasising the need for the UNSC to evolve into a more representative body that can effectively address global challenges without being hindered by political paralysis, the UK PM said: ""If we want the system to deliver for the poorest and most vulnerable then their voices must be heard. We need to make the system more representative and more responsive to those who need it most. So we will make the case not just for fairer outcomes, but fairer representation in how we reach them. And this also applies to the Security Council. It has to change to become a more representative body, willing to act – not paralysed by politics.""Promising to change how the UK does things, Starmer said: ""UK will move away from the paternalism of the past towards partnership for the future.

The council also includes ten non-permanent members elected for two-year terms.Starmer highlighted that the inclusion of nations like India, Brazil, Japan, and Germany as permanent members would enhance the council's legitimacy and effectiveness.French president Emmanuel Macron had voiced similar sentiments just days prior, stating that an expanded UNSC is essential for improving its efficiency and representation. He called for permanent seats for India, Brazil, Japan, and Germany, alongside two representatives from Africa.This push for reform has been echoed by US President Joe Biden, who also recognised India's significant role on the global stage during recent discussions with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.India has long argued that it deserves a permanent seat at the UNSC due to its growing geopolitical influence and contributions to global peacekeeping efforts.India last served as a non-permanent member from 2021 to 2022 and continues to advocate for reforms that reflect contemporary geopolitical realities.The recent endorsements from major powers like the UK, US, and France mark a significant step towards achieving this long-sought goal, as they collectively call for a reformed UNSC that better represents today's world dynamics.","UK PM Keir Starmer has added his voice to a growing chorus for India's inclusion as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.

CHANDIGARH: Reprimanding Punjab government for not releasing funds to private hospitals under Ayushman Bharat despite receiving Rs 350 crore from Centre, Punjab and Haryana HC has ordered salaries of senior functionaries, including Kumar Rahul, Punjab health department principal secretary, to be attached.The HC observed that state govt, having received money for a specified purpose, is a custodian of the money and must release i t only to actual beneficiaries.It cannot be permitted to retain the amount, leaving citizens litigating for their dues, and misappropriate the grants at the cost of the actual recipient, the HC said.The petitioners had approached HC seeking release of their pending dues. The empanelled hospitals admit patients under the scheme and raise claims for medical expenses with state health agency under Punjab govt’s department of health and family welfare.“Ordinarily, such action would call for stern orders against erring officials who misdirected funds for unauthorised use. However, before proposing any action, it is deemed expedient to seek a detailed response from the state on financial reimbursement received by it from Centre from Dec 2021 until now and how that money has been utilised,” the HC order said, seeking an affidavit from Punjab within two weeks.“The affidavit shall also inform whether the amount received could be used for the said purposes (for which the amount has been utilised) or not,” the order added. It also asked Punjab to provide details of payments made against bills from Dec 30, 2021 to Sept 24, 2024 along with date on which such payment was released.","HC orders salaries of senior functionaries, including Kumar Rahul, Punjab health department principal secretary, to be attached.

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission (EC) on Friday chided the Maharashtra administration for its failure to fully carry out its July 31 instructions to transfer all poll-related officers who have completed three years in a posting or are posted in their home districts, while ordering immediate compliance.Sources in the commission told TOI that over 100 inspector-level officers in Mumbai and several revenue officials holding key positions in the state, who fulfil the criteria laid down in EC’s guidelines on mandatory pre-poll transfers, have not been transferred despite the poll panel’s having sought a compliance report from the Maharashtra chief secretary and DGP by August 20, followed by reminders sent on Aug 22, Sept 11 and Sept 25.The non-compliance, it is suspected, could be a deliberate attempt on part of the state administration to retain officers “friendly to the ruling dispensation”, with the assembly poll process expected to kick in by October second week.Chief election commissioner (CEC) Rajiv Kumar , who is on a visit to Maharashtra along with fellow commissioners Gyanesh Kunar and S S Sandhu, expressed his displeasure over the state administration's non-compliance, stating that the delay undermines efforts to ensure a free and fair electoral process.Seeking an explanation from the Maharashtra chief secretary and DGP on why the process of relocate officials eligible for mandatory pre-poll transfers has not been completed, with no response in from the chief secretary yet and only a partial compliance update submitted by the additional DGP on Sept 13, EC on Friday said further inaction in the matter shall not be tolerated.In a communication sent to Maharashtra chief secretary on Friday, EC reminded the former that it had directed him and the state DGP to submit a compliance report of its instructions on pre-poll transfers, complete with details of action obtained from the concerned departments and offices, by Aug 20.“Despite the above directions, no report was received from the chief secretary and DGP till the due date. Reminders were issued vide the Commission's letter of even number on 22.08.2024, 11.09.2024 and 25.09.2024, directing thereby to furnish the reports urgently,” the EC underlined.The poll panel stated that while the Maharashtra chief electoral officer (CEO) had forwarded a letter from addl DGP dated Sept 13 regarding partial compliance, “no report has been received in the commission from the chief secretary till date”.Directing that its instructions on transfers be immediately and fully complied with, EC called for an explanation from the chief secretary and DGP as to why the compliance reports were not furnished even after the lapse of stipulated time limit and despite the reminders.","The Election Commission (EC) on Friday chided the Maharashtra administration for its failure to fully carry out its July 31 instructions to transfer all poll- related officers.

Maldives President Mohamed Muizzu has denied having an “India Out” agenda, asserting that the island nation had a “serious problem” with the presence of foreign military on its soil.Muizzu, who is in the US to attend the 79th session of the United Nations General Assembly, made the remarks on Thursday while responding to a question at Princeton University’s “Dean’s Leadership Series”.“We have never been against any one country at any point. It’s not ‘India Out’. Maldives faced a serious problem with foreign military presence on this soil,” Maldivian news portal adhadhu.com quoted him as saying. “The people of Maldives do not want a single foreign soldier in the country,” he said.Ties between India and Maldives came under severe strain since November last year when Muizzu, known for his pro-China leanings, took charge as Maldivian president. Muizzu had asked India to withdraw nearly 90 Indian military personnel operating three aviation platforms gifted by the country. India withdrew its military personnel by May 10 and replaced them with civilian personnel to operate a Dornier aircraft and two helicopters.Muizzu further stressed he had taken action against deputy ministers for insulting Prime Minister Narendra Modi on social media. “No one should say such a thing. I took action against it. I will not accept insulting anyone like that, whether he is a leader or an ordinary person. Every human being has a reputation,” the report quoted him as saying.Earlier this year, deputy ministers in Maldives’ youth ministry were suspended for derogatory social media posts against Modi following a backlash, with New Delhi strongly raising the matter with Male. The deputy ministers criticised Modi for his post on X following his visit to Lakshadweep, inferring that it was an attempt to project the Union territory as an alternative tourist destination to the Maldives.

PUNE: Senior economist Bibek Debroy , in an email and a letter sent to Pune-based Gokhale Institute of Politics and Economics (GIPE) vice-chancellor Ajit Ranade , has said that he was ""standing down with immediate effect"" as chancellor of the institute on ""moral"" grounds.The two communications on Sept 26 by Debroy, who is also chairman of the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister, came the day the Bombay high court extended an ad interim relief to Ranade by allowing the latter to continue as V-C till Oct 7.Ranade confirmed to TOI that he has received the email but preferred not to elaborate on the grounds that his petition challenging his removal as V-C was pending before the high court.In another letter to the University Grants Commission (UGC) chairman Jagadesh Kumar on Sept 26, Debroy has said, ""The Bombay high court has granted Dr Ajit Ranade a stay. In my view, Gokhale Institute of Politics & Economics now stands in direct violation to UGC stipulations on deemed universities. It is for you and UGC to decide on how you will act on the matter.

Debroy has said that under the circumstances, he has no moral right to continue as chancellor of GIPE and was standing down with immediate effect. He has asked the V-C to inform the board of management and everyone else who needed to be informed. He said he would not attend GIPE's convocation on Oct 5 as he was stepping down with immediate effect.""On Sept 14, Debroy had issued an order removing Ranade from the V-C's post based on a three-member fact-finding committee's report concluding that Ranade's appointment was not legally tenable as he does not fulfil the criteria of 10 years of experience as a professor to be appointed as a V-C. UGC norms state that the chancellor can remove the vice-chancellor after his appointment on grounds of incapacity, misrepresentation or violation of regulations.On June 27, the then chancellor Rajiv Kumar had issued a show cause notice to Ranade for not meeting the eligibility criteria following a complaint lodged by former faculty of Gokhale Institute, Murali Krishna.On Ranade's request, Debroy had allowed him to continue as V-C till Sept 21 to complete certain formalities.

NEW DELHI: At a time when authorities are wary of taking action against those burning crop residue prior to Haryana elections, the beginning of stubble burning in Punjab-Haryana that fouls winter air in Delhi and NCR made the Supreme Court on Friday rap the Commission of Air Quality Management ( CAQM ) for inaction and ask why no penal action is taken to stop farm fires .A bench of Justices A S Oka and A G Masih said though the CAQM Act was enacted vesting the commission with vast powers, no tangible results have been achieved on the ground as the pollution level showed no signs of improvement every year during the winter.""There has been total non-compliance of the Act. Please show us a single direction issued to any stakeholder under the Act,"" the bench said.Additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati, appearing for the Centre, informed the court about the steps taken, such as issuing advisories and guidelines, to control stubble burning. However, the top court remarked, ""It is all in the air, nothing has been shown regarding what has been done in the National Capital Region (NCR) states.""""We are of the view that though the Commission has taken steps, it needs to be more active. It must ensure that its efforts and directions issued translate into reducing the problem of pollution.""Agreeing with amicus curiae and senior advocate Aparajita Singh that CAQM has not functioned as per the mandate of the law and that accountability needs to be fixed on officials responsible for implementation of the Act, the bench said if penal action is not taken as per Section 14 of the CAQM Act, prohibitory orders against farm fires would remain only on paper.It asked the commission to file a better affidavit detailing steps taken to stop stubble burning by Thursday, the next date of hearing. Bhati said that Centre is helping the state govt in every possible way, including supply of machinery, to persuade farmers not to burn the crop residue. The bench asked the Centre to check whether the machinery has been used by farmers.When the bench repeatedly asked what concrete action was taken against those who indulge in stubble burning, Bhati said even section 14 of the CAQM Act which punishes those who flout commission's order with imprisonment up to five years, completely exempts farmers. ""Authorities have to do hand-holding and persuade the farmers not to resort to stubble burning,"" she said.The proviso to Section 14 of the Act says, ""Provisions of this section shall not apply to any farmer for causing air pollution by stubble burning or mismanagement of agricultural residue.""In fact, a bench of Justices S K Kaul and S Dhulia had on Nov 7 last year ordered authorities to forthwith stop farmers from stubble burning and made local police under the overall supervision of the DGP and chief secretary responsible for stopping crop residue burning. However, farm fires continued through most of the month with farmers refusing to bow to persuasion or threat of coercive action.Justices Oka and Masih accepted amicus curiae's suggestions that central pollution control board and all other bodies regulating air pollution in NCR be directed to tag the CAQM with the implementing authority concerned while responding to complaints on social media page to help better monitoring of pollution hot spots and taking of urgent remedial measures. CAQM in its affidavit informed the SC that ""owing to systematic planning and concerted actions for implementation of action plans framed on a year-to-year basis"", there has been a significant reduction in farm fire incidents. It said between 2021 and 2023, farm fire incidents in Punjab went down from 71,304 to 36,663; In Haryana from 6,987 to 2,303; and NCR, UP and Rajasthan from 78,550 to 39,186.",Stubble burning in Punjab-Haryana fouls winter air in Delhi and NCR.

TOI

Welcome to Mumbai! This is your first time in India, any first impressions?

That’s a common complaint from first-time visitors!

Any Indian filmmakers or films that you admire?

Do you discover something new about the film every time you screen it for a new audience?

Nostalgia runs deep in your films. What’s that piece of the past that you most long for today?

Any modern storytelling techniques in cinema today that you’d love to try out?

So, you see promise in AI?

Some people find it threatening, though.

They say movie magic unfolds on the big screen, but Italian filmmaker Giuseppe Tornatore reminded us that there’s as much wonder behind the rectangular hole of the projection room with his 1988 film ‘ Cinema Paradiso ’ on the bittersweet nostalgia of old movie houses and the friendship between a boy and a projectionist. So, who better to honour these unsung heroes of cinema than the Oscar-winning director who was once a projectionist himself? On a rainy Friday morning in Mumbai, ahead of awarding two Indian projectionists as part of Film Heritage Foundation ’s (FHF) festival, ‘Cinema Italian Style—Celebrating Tornatore and the Masters of Italian Cinema’, the 68-year-old director spoke toabout the lasting legacy of Cinema Paradiso, urgent need to preserve the theatres of yore and his unexpected enthusiasm for AI.Yes, this is my first time in India, thanks to Shivendra (Dungarpur, founder of FHF) and the Film Heritage Foundation event. I arrived two days ago and had some time to explore. The city has a familiar atmosphere—some streets and the people remind me of Palermo when I was very young, around five or six. The crowd, the attitude—they’re so polite and open. I’ve taken many pictures. The only thing I don’t love is the sound of the klaxons (Italian for car horns) going pom-pom, pom-pom! (Laughs)It’s a short trip, but I’m very happy to be here. I’ve received invitations to India for years but never had the chance until now. I’m very fascinated by the culture and the people—not just from a tourist’s perspective.Tornatore: The last Indian movie I watched was one year ago, ‘The Last Film Show’ (Chello Show) by Pan Nalin that was inspired by Cinema Paradiso and represented India at the Academy Awards. I really liked it. For me, though, the most important filmmaker from India is Satyajit Ray . In many of his movies, I felt an original point of view— an authenticity about his world. Some aspects remind me of our Italian Neorealism. I love that kind of cinema. But I’m not familiar with the new Indian movies. I’ve never seen a Bollywood film. I would like to, but in Italy, we don’t have any distributors that bring those movies to us. We hear about them with great curiosity. I’m told many people here know some of my films— that’s a privilege and a great honour.It’s extraordinary how 36 years after Cinema Paradiso initially struggled at the box office before it went on to become a worldwide hit, continues to be celebrated. Why do you think it still resonates with people?It’s a mystery. I don’t know why this movie, made little by little, is still so loved after 36 years. Maybe it’s the shared experience of generations going to the cinema—something universal. The story is simple, about the end of a small village cinema. Maybe that touched the emotions of everyone who loves cinema. There’s no other explanation. It’s a normal movie, nothing particularly special, yet people love it. After almost 40 years, I’m still busy with interviews and introducing it at big events—more than when it first came out. (Laughs) It’s very unusual!Yes, that’s why I say it’s a mystery. Some people tell me they watched ‘Cinema Paradiso’ again and cried— even their children love it. Young generations have an immediate, strong emotional connection with the movie. It’s one of those mysteries that only movies can give us.Cinema Paradiso was inspired by your days as a projectionist and the closing of a beloved theatre in your village. India’s grand single-screen movie houses hang by a thread. Any thoughts on preserving these spaces? Do they still have a place in modern cinema?First, I have to say I envy your country because you still have many movie theatres. In Italy and much of Europe, theatres aren’t as numerous as they were 20 years ago. It’s crucial to preserve these special spaces. The biggest mistake theatre owners made was they built a cinema and then forgot about it for years, not keeping up with modern comforts and technology. So people prefer their plasma screens and surround sound at home. This is a big issue in Europe, too. Theatres with uncomfortable seats or poor lighting get forgotten. But when people enter a beautiful, well-maintained cinema, they return. In Rome, there aren’t many theatres left, but the few that are well-kept do very well. Take Gian Luca Farinelli who has rebuilt a historic theatre (Modernissimo Cinema) in Bologna. Today, with technology changing so rapidly, you must offer the best quality to keep people coming back.In Cinema Paradiso, you beautifully portray how these cinema houses were not just about watching a film but about community and a much-needed escape.Yes, exactly. When I made Cinema Paradiso, Italy was experiencing a crisis with movie theatres. Many were closing every day. I had been living in Rome for many years, but when I would return to my village to visit my family, I noticed that all the cinemas were going. It was a shock, really traumatic for me. As a child, there were seven movie theatres in my village, but by the time I was 25, none were left. I wanted to capture that, to show the world what life in the cinema was like, especially at a time when people were beginning to forget that experience. The emotional instinct behind Cinema Paradiso was a deep nostalgia for that world—the energy of the theatres, with children screaming, people laughing, everyone knowing each other. In a village, you know everyone, and to have 200, 300 people in one room, all watching the same story—it’s a special feeling. That energy has been slowly disappearing, and I wanted to preserve it.Many young people don’t know what life in a movie theatre was like. Many of them don’t even go to the cinema. They love movies, of course, but often they watch at home or on their phones. They don’t have that communal experience. It’s important to show them what they’re missing. But this isn’t a new phenomenon. When I shot Cinema Paradiso, there were no cinemas left in the village where we filmed. The young boy who played the lead didn’t know what a movie theatre was. While we were building the set, he and his friends were curious, asking, “What is this?” One Sunday, I organised a free screening of E.T. for the village kids, but nobody came. When I asked the boy why, he said, “We’ve already seen it on television.” So this decline in cinema attendance has been happening for a long time. We need to stop losing this experience from our culture. We need to educate young people to participate in this special way of watching stories, in that silent communication that only happens in a movie theatre, with others.Artificial intelligence! A few months ago, they did an experiment where they described a scene in just three lines—a young girl walking in Tokyo, her attitude, the way she looked around—and the computer, using AI, created the shot without any filming. Incredible.Yes! In the future, I might not need a producer or crew. I could write a story and create the film without a budget or losing time. Making a movie has always been hard and time-consuming. Spending years trying to find people who love the project as much as you isn’t easy. The idea of making a film without those obstacles sounds wonderful!I know, I know. This technology is both amazing and dangerous. But making movies has always been difficult, so the possibility of making a film without hurdles, it’s exciting. Another thing I love is the experiment with virtual reality, this immersive experience. A few months ago in San Francisco, I tried a VR headset and it was unbelievable — the new way to tell stories through images. So when people ask me if cinema is dying, I tell them, no, we’re not at the end of movies, we’re at the beginning. Entering a world with endless possibilities for evolving the language of cinema. Cinema will never die.",Italian filmmaker Giuseppe Tornatore was once a projectionist himself. His 1988 film ‘ Cinema Paradiso ’ on the bittersweet nostalgia of old movie houses. The 68-year-old director spoke toabout the lasting legacy of the film and urgent need to preserve the theatres of yore.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113749523,imgsize-1301590,width-400,resizemode-4/113749523.jpg"
Global alliance of 131 CEOs for climate action cut emissions while boosting revenues: WEF,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/global-alliance-of-131-ceos-for-climate-action-cut-emissions-while-boosting-revenues-wef/articleshow/113748247.cms,"NEW DELHI: A group of 131 CEOs of the Global Alliance for climate action representing some big companies from across 27 countries, including India, had reduced 10% of aggregate absolute emissions between 2019 to 2022 while recording 18% aggregated growth in their revenues during the same period, according to a report from the World Economic Forum (WEF) which shows that the economic growth and climate actions can go hand in hand.The report, released on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York on Thursday, noted that the 18% aggregate revenue growth, surpassing global GDP growth of 15%, was amounted to over $640 million whereas emission reduction of 10% was equivalent to 450 megatons, roughly the annual emissions output of France or the United Kingdom.The Alliance is the world’s largest CEO-led community focused on net-zero emissions, representing $4 trillion in revenue and 12 million employees in 12 industries, including healthcare, retail, heavy industry and agriculture.Tata Steel, ReNew Power, Hindustan Zinc, Mahindra Group, Infosys and Wipro are among the Indian companies within the Alliance of CEO Climate Leaders, launched alongside the signing of the Paris Agreement on climate change. CEOs of big tech multi-national companies such as Microsoft, Dell, HP, Bloomberg LP, Ericsson and Hitachi are also part of the group.“The alliance is showing that businesses can collectively make significant progress towards implementing the goals of the Paris Agreement,” Sumant Sinha, chairman and CEO of ReNew Power and co-chair of the Alliance, was quoted as saying by the WEF.Underlining that the economics of climate action can work in all regions – from emerging markets to developed economies, Sinha said, “We hope these results encourage more businesses to join us in applying their knowledge and skills to transition to a truly global,net-zero economy that benefits communities all around the world.”The report flagged that the 10% decrease in absolute emissions is significantly ahead of the emissions reductions achieved by the world’s biggest economies and emitters, including the United States (-2%) and the European Union (-3%). In contrast, India and China saw growth in emissions of 6% and 7% respectively, in the same period.“This clearly demonstrates that positive climate action does not have to come at the expense of economic performance,” said Gim Huay Neo, managing director, WEF.","A group of 131 CEOs of the Global Alliance for climate action representing some big companies from across 27 countries, including India, had reduced 10% of aggregate absolute emissions between 2019 to 2022.

The court directed the formation of a Medical Board , which submitted its report. In the report, it was stated that the pregnancy is around 29 weeks and the termination of pregnancy at this stage as well as carrying the pregnancy to full term would harm the mental and physical being of the victim.Since the victim and her family members wanted the medical termination of pregnancy, the court allowed the writ petition.The court observed, ""In umpteen matters that had appeared before us wherein the petitioner had prayed for medical termination of pregnancy, we have found that the Medical Colleges including the Chief Medical Officers of the Districts and the doctors that are appointed as part of the Medical Board for examination of the victim are not properly informed about the procedure to be followed while carrying out the examination of the victim and the subsequent medical termination, if ordered.""The court said that the procedure must be followed in cases of medical examination of a victim and the medical termination of pregnancy as laid down in the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act , 1971; Medical Termination of Pregnancy Rules, 2003 and the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Regulations, 2003 as well as in various judgments of the Supreme Court.""One has to keep in mind the sensitivity involved in the entire process and it is a matter of grave concern that doctors in some of the districts are not at all familiar with the above legislations and the procedure established by the Supreme Court of India.""Thus, the court directed the principal secretary, Medical Health and Family Welfare, Uttar Pradesh, to issue the standard operating procedure to all the chief medical officers.","Allahabad High court said that doctors in the state are not aware of the procedure to be followed in cases of medical termination of pregnancy.

The US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) has approved Bristol Myers Squibb ’s new oral medicine, Cobenfy , for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults. This approval marks the first new type of schizophrenia medicine in several decades that reduces the mental illness symptoms without the common side effects .“Today’s landmark approval of our first-in-class treatment for schizophrenia marks an important milestone for the community.After more than 30 years, there is now an entirely new pharmacological approach for schizophrenia — one that has the potential to change the treatment paradigm,” said Chris Boerner, board chair and CEO of Bristol Myers Squibb. “As we reenter the field of neuropsychiatry, we are dedicated to changing the conversation around serious mental illness, beginning with today’s approval for schizophrenia.”Bristol Myers Squibb plans to make Cobenfy, a twice-daily pill, available by late October. The drug will cost $1,850 per month, or $22,500 annually, before insurance and rebates.Schizophrenia affects around 2.8 million people in the United States, impacting how they think, feel, and behave. Symptoms of Schizophrenia usually appear in early adulthood and vary greatly among individuals, making the condition hard to diagnose and manage. Current treatments can be effective, but up to 60% of patients find them inadequate or experience intolerable side effects.“For people living with schizophrenia, it's often difficult to find a treatment that works for them. Having a variety of treatment options gives patients and healthcare providers the tools to help manage this serious condition,” said Gordon Lavigne, CEO of the Schizophrenia & Psychosis Action Alliance. “People living with schizophrenia want and deserve more. Today’s approval provides a new option as people with schizophrenia move forward with proper support to rebuild their lives.”","The US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) has approved Bristol Myers Squibb ’s new oral medicine, Cobenfy, for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults.

Liv Morgan’s Personal Life

Dominik Mysterio , a rising star in WWE and the son of legendary wrestler Rey Mysterio , has gained attention not only for his impressive in-ring career but also for his personal life. Fans have often wondered about his relationship status, and many have speculated on whether he’s married. While there have been rumors regarding Dominik being in a relationship with Liv Morgan.Dominik’s romantic life has frequently been tied to fellow WWE Superstar, Liv Morgan and this was further escalated after the WWE Women’s World Champion stole a kiss after he failed help Becky Lynch capture the title.Former North American Champion Dominik Mysterio is married to his long-time girlfriend, Marie Juliette . The two tied the knot earlier this year, on March 6, 2024. However, Mysterio had made their relationship public on social media nine years ago. Their wedding was attended by several WWE stars, including Damian Priest, Austin Theory, Rey Mysterio (his father), and his on-screen partner, Rhea Ripley.Dominik and Marie Juliette’s love story feels like a fairy tale, as they instantly connected when they first met at the age of 14 in a school Spanish class. After nearly 12 years of dating, they got engaged in January 2023. While not much is known about Marie Juliette's career, rumors suggest she may be pursuing a path in music.Although Dominik Mysterio is making waves on WWE Raw , his heart belongs to his wife, MJ. Still, after the events on Raw, he may have to face some serious consequences when Rhea Ripley, known as “Mami,” eventually returns.Also read: ""I Heard The Entire Show Just Got Ripped In Half"": WWE Superstar Reflects On His Frustrations With Last-Minute Script Changes During Vince McMahon's Tenure According to Dominik's social media post, he got married in March 2024. The couple had previously announced their engagement earlier in 2023. Many WWE superstars were present at the wedding, including Liv Morgan, Rey Mysterio, and Rhea Ripley.Dominik and his wife first met in 2011 during a Spanish class when they were just teenagers. Over the course of more than a decade, their relationship has grown stronger, enduring challenges along the way.Dominik Mysterio and Liv Morgan have been subject to countless rumors, mostly due to their on-screen chemistry and interactions. Liv, known for her energetic persona and in-ring talent, has consistently been a fan favorite, and her rumored relationship with Dominik only intensified the attention around her.Though some fans have believed that the two might be romantically involved in real life, these assumptions are largely fueled by their storylines and social media interactions. So, whatever we witness on screen is mostly scripted. There is a lot of difference between the reel life and the real deal.Liv Morgan, born Gionna Jene Daddio, has previously been linked to a few fellow wrestlers, but she is notably private about her romantic life. While fans might be curious about whether she’s involved with Dominik, they are just friend offscreen. Liv’s focus has mostly remained on her WWE career, where she continues to evolve as one of the top talents on the roster.Also read: WWE Hall of Famer Says that Hell in a Cell Might Disrupt Punk-McIntyre's Raw Feud","Dominik Mysterio is married to his long-time girlfriend, Marie Juliette.

Stalin lauds Senthil Balaji’s “courage”

CHENNAI: Chief minister M K Stalin has raised with Prime Minister Narendra Modi the delay in Chennai Metro Rail phase 2 and urged early approval for a 50:50 equity sharing between Union and state govts as was done for phase I. The final completion date has been pushed from Dec 2027 to Dec 2028 which could lead to cost overruns, he said.In a memorandum presented to Modi, Stalin recalled that Union home minister Amit Shah laid the foundation for phase 2 in 2020, and Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced “counterpart funding” in the 2021-22 Union budget.Public Investment Board (PIB) recommended it a central sector initiative, which would provide Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL) with an equity infusion of 10,814.8 crore.“As a state-sector project, state govt’s infusion alone is not possible as it will affect the ownership structure. Equal equity participation by both govts is absolutely necessary,” he said. CMRL is a joint venture with 50% equity holding each by state and Centre.Phase 2’s progress has slowed down due to fiscal constraints faced by TN under Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act. Last year, these constraints led it to instruct CMRL to reduce the pace of work, resulting in a budget cut from Rs 10,000 crore to Rs 9,000 crore. This limited total project expenditure to Rs 8,000 crore, he said. Consequently, the commissioning dates of various stages are being delayed by almost a year.Expressing disapproval of Union govt’s non-release of funds under the Samagra Shiksha Scheme linked to National Education Policy (NEP), Stalin said the state has been implementing “most of NEP’s provisions,” including a breakfast scheme. NEP states there would be greater flexibility in implementing 3-language formula and no language would be imposed on any state, but a clause of the MoU to establish schools under PM-SHRI does not reflect this spirit. “TN is seeking an amendment to the MoU in line with the constitutional safeguard provided to it as per the Official Language Rules 1976.”Demanding the release of 145 fishermen and their boats from Sri Lankan custody, Stalin said his meeting with Modi was pleasant. “The PM spoke to us happily. It is up to him to turn it into a fruitful one.”Later, Stalin commended former minister V Senthil Balaji’s “courage,” expressing confidence in a successful legal battle for his release.Addressing reporters on the sidelines of his meeting with the Prime Minister, he said, “I just told you yesterday. He has been brave. We appreciate his courage,” Stalin said. “We are confident that he will be freed by waging a battle in the court soon. He too has (the confidence).”Balaji met the chief minister after Stalin returned from Delhi. Balaji visited Udhayanidhi Stalin at his camp office, and the two exchanged greetings.",M K Stalin has raised with Prime Minister Narendra Modi the delay in Chennai Metro Rail phase 2.

I’ve said this before, let Jacob rampage through the whole roster, [and] give him those enhancement matches to build him. We’ve seen Jacob, however long he’s been on, but is there anything different? You can only do so much on a run-in. This is me. This is what I’m saying. You really want to go with a guy, show his talent.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.",Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.
