NEW DELHI: A five-judge constitution bench of the SC led by CJI B R Gavai on Tuesday fixed a nine-day schedule to deliberate on a Presidential Reference that has questioned the SC’s power to fix timelines for the President and Governors on granting, refusing and withholding assent to Bills passed by Assemblies.The bench of CJI Gavai, and Justices Surya Kant, Vikram Nath, P S Narasimha and A S Chandurkar said the hearing would commence from Aug 19, when it will first hear senior advocates K K Venugopal and A M Singhvi on behalf of Kerala and Tamil Nadu, respectively, on the states’ preliminary objections to maintainability of the Reference.It said those opposing the reference, represented by Kapil Sibal, Rakesh Dwivedi, Gopal Subramaniam, would be given four days – Aug 19, 20, 21 and 26 - to complete their arguments. Those supporting the Reference – attorney general R Venkataramani and solicitor general Tushar Mehta – would place their response to maintainability plea as well as the constitutional issues warranting the Reference on Aug 28, Sep 2, 3 and 9.It reserved Sep 10 for rejoinders by parties and clarified that under no circumstance would the schedule be breached and told lawyers to arrange time-schedule for their arguments through prior consultation.It appointed advocate Aman Mehta as the nodal counsel for those supporting Reference and Misha Rohatgi as one for opposers.“The nodal counsel in consultation with lawyers shall arrange the timetable for the arguing counsel so that the hearing could be completed on Sep 10.

Microsoft has responded to the criticism that it fired American employees to hire foreign cheap labor saying that H-1B applications are no way related to the recent job eliminations and many employees on H-1Bs also lost their jobs. The statement comes amid an intense debate over Microsoft's announcement of 9,000 layoffs while the company reportedly made 4712 applications for H-1Bs.“Our H-1B applications are in no way related to the recent job eliminations in part because employees on H-1B’s also lost their roles.

""You see some big tech companies where they'll lay off 9,000 workers, and then they'll apply for a bunch of overseas visas. And I sort of wonder; that doesn't totally make sense to me,"" he said.""That displacement and that math worries me a bit.

No India-US Trade Deal Before August 1?

India-US trade deal stalemate: Ahead of his self-imposed tariff deadline, US President Donald Trump has said that a trade agreement with India has not yet been finalized. “India trade deal not been finalized,” said Trump. Asked whether India would face 20-25% tariff rates, he said, ""Yeah, I think so. India is my friend. They ended the war with Pakistan at my request...The deal with India is not finalised. India has been a good friend, but India has charged basically more tariffs than almost any other country..."".

In the last few weeks Trump had said that the US is ‘nearing’ a deal with India. The likelihood of an interim trade deal announcement before the deadline appears slim for now.Earlier in the day, Reuters reported that India is preparing for a temporary reciprocal tariff rate ranging between 20-25%. India anticipates facing elevated US tariffs on certain export items as an interim arrangement, two officials from the Indian government told the news agency.""Talks are progressing well, and a delegation is expected in Delhi by mid-August,"" one of the Indian government officials said, adding that President Donald Trump could issue a tariff letter imposing duties of 20 or 25% in a ""worst-case scenario"".""However, we assume it would be a temporary measure, considering the five rounds of trade talks that have taken place.

TCS Layoffs: NITES Wants Halt On Terminations

Other Trade Unions Also Slam TCS

TCS layoffs: The news of TCS planning to sack thousands of employees has led to Nascent Information Technology Employees Senate (NITES) writing to Labour Minister Mansukh Mandaviya . India’s biggest IT services firm, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on Sunday said it would be laying off around 12,000 employees over the course of the year, which means an approximate 2% cut in its workforce.With this TCS is set to implement its biggest workforce reduction ever. Previously, the company had terminated approximately 3,000 employees in 2015, which was around 1% of its total staff at that time. This is reportedly the biggest mass layoff that the Indian IT industry is set to witness.NITES, an IT workers' union, has written a letter to Union labour minister Mansukh Mandaviya, voicing concerns regarding the mass sackings announced by Tata Consultancy Services.According to an ET report, the IT workers' organisation challenged the legality of these dismissals and requested official instructions be issued to TCS to ""halt all terminations and reinstate affected employees.""Also Read | TCS layoffs ‘biggest ever’ for Indian IT! Artificial Intelligence not to blame for ‘difficult’ decision? Top 10 things to know about mass sackings The union emphasised that permitting a corporation of TCS's magnitude to conduct large-scale layoffs and firings without proper procedures or accountability would establish the wrong standard for other organisations, leading to employment uncertainty, diminished worker protections, and reduced confidence in India's labour environment.NITES urged the Ministry to hold the company's senior leadership responsible, particularly given the CEO's salary increase during a period of widespread job cuts.According to TCS's annual report, CEO K Krithivasan received Rs 26.5 crore in FY25, representing a 4.6% increase from the previous financial year. The report indicated that his compensation was 329.8 times the median employee salary.Additionally, NITES called for an investigation into TCS's delayed onboarding practices. Earlier this month, the union had highlighted concerns regarding delays in the lateral recruitment of 600 professionals.IT sector employee unions have labelled the dismissals unlawful and encouraged TCS staff facing redundancy to resist resignation pressures. The Karnataka State IT/ITeS Employees Union has appealed to the technology major to withdraw its staff reduction strategy and restore positions of impacted workers.The Forum for IT Employees (FITE) has recommended that TCS should avoid applying direct pressure on employees to resign. Instead, they advised the company to provide notice period remuneration, severance packages and extend health insurance benefits for a 12-month period.Also Read | ‘Don’t resign under pressure….’: TCS layoffs opposed by IT employee unions; IT giant to sack 12,000 employees","NITES, an IT workers' union, has written a letter to Union labour minister Mansukh Mandaviya, voicing concerns regarding the mass sackings.

He manipulatively estranged her from daughter, says 1st wife

NEW DELHI: Can a marriage solemnised between a man and a woman belonging to the Kuki tribe in a church be dissolved by the Songpijan village committee and 'gaonburas (village elders)' in Assam's Dima Hasao district on proceedings initiated by the husband relying on customary law?The Gauhati HC had said once a marriage takes place in a church in terms with the Christian Marriage Act, 1872, it cannot be annulled by customary law practices involving village elders. Such a marriage can only be dissolved through proceedings initiated before the HC or the district judge as per section 10 of the Divorce Act, 1869, it had said.This HC ruling landed the Indian ambassador to Cuba, Thongkomang Armstrong Changsan, in a piquant matrimonial situation as he ended up with two wives. Prior to the HC declaring in 2022 that his 1994 church marriage with Neikhol Changsan subsisted, he had married another woman after the customary divorce. From both marriages, he has a daughter each.After failure of the mediation ordered by the Supreme Court, during pendency of Changsan's appeal, a bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi on Friday orally observed that the HC judgment is legally sound. Finding that the Indian Foreign Service officer is now married for nearly a decade and half, it decided to find a solution to this legal-matrimonial complexity and help the first wife start a new life.The ambassador said he has been paying a monthly maintenance of Rs 20,000 to Neikhol and has given her a house in Delhi.Neikhol argued the case herself and told the court that she had single handedly brought up her daughter without any participation from her husband.Neikhol, the first wife, alleged that he has now manipulatively estranged her daughter (29) from her. For the ambassador, senior advocate Menaka Guruswamy said the father had been meeting the expenses of his daughter, who is pursuing a career in Bengaluru.Neikhol appealed to SC to ""protect her honour and dignity"" while describing how surreptitiously Changsan dissolved the marriage using tribal community elders, and remarried. The Justice Kant-led bench said, ""We have absolutely no sympathy for the man. The HC judgment is in your favour, and you have suffered socially and mentally. But can you think of a way to start life afresh?""Interestingly, 'Kuki Inpi' of Assam, the highest governing body of the Kuki tribe in the state, has said Kuki customary law can neither dissolve a Christian marriage performed in church nor can it force any couple to reunite against the will of the couple.SC said it could be profitable for Neikhol to meet her daughter and discuss future course of action, and asked the ambassador to arrange for her flight tickets to Bengaluru, a place of stay near her daughter's place, and pay her an ad hoc amount of Rs 3 lakh to enable her to meet her daughter.""If at all there is a possibility of settlement, the daughter could have a significant role to play,"" Justice Kant said, adding that the IFS officer must advise his daughter to re-establish contact with her mother.","The Gauhati HC had said once a marriage takes place in a church, it cannot be annulled by customary law practices involving village elders.

We are only for people acting solely as advocates and about privileged lawyer-client communications.""""The privilege of immunity from prosecution statutorily conferred on lawyers for appearing, advising or giving legal opinions to clients is like the sanction provision under the IPC.

Solicitor general Tushar Mehta said he agrees with everyone in the courtroom that lawyers must not be summoned for their professional work.Mehta said it would not be prudent for the court to lay down guidelines based on a singular infraction and cautioned that it could prove counterproductive. ""The agencies also cannot ignore a lawyer, who is a director of a company under investigation for fraudulent transactions, giving an opinion for commission of an illegality. Merely because he is a lawyer, he would not be immune from prosecution for the acts he did as director of the company,"" the SG said.Giving another example, he also said a fugitive, who fled the country, told the agency that the documents demanded from him are available with a law firm and that the officers could take it from the law firm. ""Should the agency not go to the law firm to collect the documents? Will that impinge upon the lawyer's privilege?""

SC questions age restriction for surrogacy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-questions-age-restriction-for-surrogacy/articleshow/122985706.cms,"If couple in their 50s, 60s can adopt, why can't they have surrogate child, asks SC

NEW DELHI: Questioning the restrictions under surrogacy laws, including age limit on intended parents and surrogate mothers, Supreme Court Tuesday said laws shouldn't frustrate the wish of childless couples, widows and divorcees to become parents through surrogacy. Instead, the laws should frustrate commercial surrogacy.A bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and K V Viswanathan said present laws seem ""harsh"" to those wanting to take the surrogacy route to parenthood. The bench is examining provisions of Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021 and the Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Act, 2021.The laws set age limits for intended parents and surrogate mothers. An intended mother must be aged between 23 and 50, and the intended father between 26 and 55 years. Further, a surrogate mother must be married and between 25 and 35 years of age, have a biological child, and only act as a surrogate once in her lifetime.Laws allow single women (widowed or divorced) between ages 35 and 45 to pursue surrogacy. Appearing for the govt, additional solicitor general (ASG) Aishwarya Bhati defended the provisions, saying the age bar was needed to ensure a child's welfare and to prevent commercial surrogacy.She said the limits were also set keeping in mind the genetic quality of gametes and urged the court to refrain from passing an interim order.The bench, however, said rationality was lacking in the provision and asked why a single woman could not go for surrogacy. ""If she is a widow or a divorcee then she needs it more. Look at the void in her life... Rationality and object are absent. Look how harsh it is,"" the bench observed. It said if a couple in their 50s and 60s can adopt, then why can't they have a surrogate child.SC reserved its order on a plea of three petitioners, seeking its approval to go for surrogacy as they are age barred. They submitted that the laws came into force in 2022 but they started the process much earlier as they froze their embryo in 2012 and 2016, and that they should be allowed to pursue. Bhati argued that there were multiple reasons for freezing embryos, and it might not just be for surrogacy.""Crystallisation of rights happens on implantation of the embryo in the uterus and not just on freezing of embryos,"" the ASG submitted. She said there are a large number of embryos that might have been frozen earlier but they cannot claim exemption from the law.

Multiple petitions have been filed challenging various provisions of the Acts. One of the petitioners submitted that the laws were discriminatory as it barred a single woman from surrogacy.""The restrictions are wholly discriminatory and without any rational or reason behind it inasmuch as the said restriction is not only infringing fundamental rights of the petitioner, but also violative of the basic human rights of an individual to found a family as recognised by the UN and reproductive rights, which have been recognised as an aspect of personal liberty under Article 21,"" the plea said.","Justices B V Nagarathna and K V Viswanathan said present laws seem ""harsh"" to those wanting to take the surrogacy route to parenthood.

Jaishankar’s Savage Declaration Of War At QUAD Meeting: ‘India Will Defend Its People’ | Watch

NEW DELHI: India is expected to participate in the UN high-level conference on peaceful settlement of the Palestine question and implementation of the 2-state solution, amid renewed international efforts to end the Gaza war. According to a list of delegates, 123 countries and agencies, including India, have signed up so far for the 3-day meeting beginning Monday that will be co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia, both key strategic partners for India.India had also voted in favour of a UNGA resolution last year that announced an international summit in June 2025 to discuss the 2-state solution. However, the conference couldn’t take place last month because of the Iran-Iraq conflict.The US had last month warned governments around the world against participating in the conference, saying it would mar ongoing efforts to end the war and free hostages, according to a diplomatic cable witnessed and reported by Reuters from Paris and Washington.According to France, the conference aims to chart a path towards the 2-state solution through “concrete measures” proposed by the 8 working groups, which have conducted extensive consultations with UN member-states and civil society.The conference is drawing attention also for the announcement by French President Emmanuel Macron this week that France will recognise the Palestinian state, becoming the first G7 country to do so. The US has condemned France’s decision and will skip the conference along with Israel.Indian ambassador to the UN, P Harish, had in a statement last week in the Security Council on the Palestinian question had taken note of the high-level conference. “While engaging in a forward-leaning and constructive manner, it is our hope that this Conference would pave the way for concrete steps towards achieving a two-State solution,” said the official, while strongly calling for a ceasefire to be put in place and seeking release of all hostages.India, which was among the 19 countries that abstained from voting on a UNGA resolution in June for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire, has been in touch with the 8 working groups and is expected to further provide its inputs on the 2-state solution during the conference. The level of India’s participation is still under consideration.On the Gaza issue, India has continued to walk a tightrope between its vital and growing ties with Israel and the traditional support for the Palestinian cause, including the 2-state solution. While the government strongly defends Israel’s right to defend itself from Hamas terrorist attacks, it also expects Israel to follow international law and not target civilians. “India shares historic and strong ties with our Palestinian brothers and sisters. We have always stood by them and our commitment towards the Palestinian cause is unwavering,” said Harish in his remarks in the Council.The ministry of external affairs also reiterated the Indian position in Parliament on Friday that India has always supported a negotiated 2-state solution, towards establishment of a sovereign, independent and viable State of Palestine within secure and recognized borders, living side by side in peace with Israel.","Despite US warnings against participation, India hopes the conference will pave the way for concrete steps towards a two-state solution. 123 countries and agencies, including India, have signed up so far for the 3-day meeting beginning Monday.

A United Airlines flight bound for Munich was forced to return to Washington Dulles Airport on Friday shortly after takeoff, following a mid-air engine failure. The Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner, operating as Flight UA108, experienced a malfunction in its left engine just minutes after departure, prompting the pilots to declare a Mayday emergency and initiate an urgent return.The issue occurred as the aircraft climbed to an altitude of 5,000 feet. The flight crew immediately coordinated with air traffic controllers to plan a safe emergency landing.To reduce weight for landing, the pilots entered a holding pattern northwest of Washington to dump fuel. They requested to maintain an altitude of 6,000 feet during the procedure, and controllers provided instructions to ensure the aircraft remained clear of other traffic.Air traffic control asked the crew,""hold, fuel, or just get set up there?"" The pilot responded, ""climb six and adjust fuel,"" reported CNBC TV 18 quoting aviationa2z.The pilot later informed ATC that the aircraft was actively dumping fuel at 6,000 feet while flying northwest. Controllers then directed the aircraft to a heading of 020 degrees and requested confirmation once the fuel dump was complete.After finishing the procedure, the crew requested an Instrument Landing System (ILS) approach to Runway 19 Centre. The aircraft landed safely, but due to the engine failure, it was unable to taxi on its own and had to be towed from the runway.No injuries were reported in the incident. The airline and relevant aviation authorities are expected to carry out a full investigation into the cause of the engine malfunction.","Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner experienced a malfunction in its left engine just minutes after departure.

Kolkata: Commuters may have to wait an entire year to use Kavi Subhash metro station, the terminal station of the North-South Blue Line, which is also the city's lifeline. Metro Railway has decided to demolish the station and rebuild it after cracks appeared on its columns, which were found to be beyond repair.""We have already started the razing work. Workers have been assigned to dismantle parts of the station – the signal and telecom (ST) equipment and so on,"" a senior official of Metro Railway said on Tuesday, a day after the station was shut down and metro services terminated at Sahid Khudiram.When asked to comment, Metro Railway general manager P Uday Kumar Reddy said: ""The station's piers or columns on which the platform stands have weakened beyond repair. If the pillars are to be dismantled, how can the station remain? The entire Kavi Subhash station will have to be rebuilt.""The general manager added that Metro Railway has been planning to rectify the constructional defects of Kavi Subhash station for some time now. ""We have invited tenders from contractors who can do the restoration work. We would have started after Durga Puja. But now, we are suddenly faced with an emergency situation with the heavy downpour that seemed to have led to some ground subsidence.Therefore, the work has to be taken up without further delay. ""The Officials confirmed that this was the first time in the history of Kolkata Metro that a station was being dismantled and rebuilt.

The final section in the southern end was opened in Oct 2010.""Over the last four decades, the corridor has remained the city's transportation lifeline, ferrying around 6 lakh passengers every day, but no other station's design has been as flawed as the terminal Kavi Subhash station.

""We were a bit unprepared for what happened yesterday. Different kinds of planning are going on. Our utmost priority is passenger safety and security. We shall also try our best to get the work completed as quickly as possible, so that operations can be resumed at Kavi Subhash station,"" the Metro GM said.He said the station would be opened to the public as soon as the rebuilt station was in a position to run trains safely.

NOIDA: UP govt announced a late-night reshuffle on Monday, assigning new district magistrates for Noida and Ghaziabad. Medha Roopam, a 2014-batch IAS officer, became the first woman DM of Noida. Currently the DM of Kasganj, she will replace Manish Verma, who has been transferred to Prayagraj.Medha is no stranger to the district of Gautam Budh Nagar, having served as additional chief executive officer of Greater Noida Authority from Feb 2023 to June 2024, when she handled major infrastructure and planning projects.An economics graduate from St. Stephen's College of Delhi University, Roopam began her career in Bareilly and has since held key administrative positions in Meerut, Unnao, Lucknow, Barabanki, Hapur, and Kasganj. A national-level rifle shooter, she won three gold medals in the Kerala State Shooting Championship before securing an all-India rank of 10 in the 2014 UPSC exam.Her tenure in Hapur saw focused immunisation and Ayushman Bharat campaigns. In Kasganj, she made headlines for driving a tractor through flooded areas of Gangagarh to monitor rescue efforts.Medha is the daughter of retired Kerala-cadre IAS officer and current chief election commissioner Gyanesh Kumar.Her husband, Santosh Kumar Singh, is the DM of Saharanpur.The reshuffle also brought changes to Ghaziabad, where Ravindra Kumar Mandar — a 2013-batch IAS officer and former DM of Prayagraj — replaced Deepak Meena, who moved to Gorakhpur.

Microsoft cuts 15,000+ jobs across multiple divisions despite record profits

AI revolution drives management restructuring as technology writes 30% of code

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella delivered a sobering message to employees Wednesday as the company announced its fourth round of layoffs this year, eliminating 9,000 more positions and bringing total workforce reductions to over 15,000 this year.""Before anything else, I want to speak to what's been weighing heavily on me, and what I know many of you are thinking about: the recent job eliminations. These decisions are among the most difficult we have to make. They affect people we've worked alongside, learned from, and shared countless moments with—our colleagues, teammates, and friends,"" Nadella wrote in an internal memo addressing the latest cuts affecting 4% of Microsoft's 228,000 global workforce.The CEO continued: ""I want to express my sincere gratitude to those who have left. Their contributions have shaped who we are as a company, helping build the foundation we stand on today. And for that, I am deeply grateful.""The year-long elimination spree began with performance-based cuts in earlier in the year, escalated with 6,000 layoffs in May targeting software engineers and project managers, continued with 300+ June reductions, and culminated in Wednesday's 9,000-person reduction. The gaming division suffered the heaviest losses, with over 3,000 positions eliminated since Microsoft's $69 billion Activision Blizzard acquisition closed in 2023.High-profile casualties include The Initiative studio's complete closure, cancellation of anticipated titles Perfect Dark and Everwild, and 200 job cuts at King, maker of Candy Crush. Xbox CEO Phil Spencer told gaming employees the cuts would ""position Gaming for enduring success"" while acknowledging the timing during Microsoft's strongest gaming performance period.Despite the workforce reductions, Microsoft reported $25.8 billion in quarterly net income with 18% year-over-year growth, maintaining its position among the S&P 500's most profitable companies.Nadella addressed the apparent contradiction between strong financial performance and mass layoffs, describing it as ""the enigma of success in an industry that has no franchise value."" The CEO emphasised Microsoft's transformation from a ""software factory to an intelligence engine"" while the company invests $80 billion in AI infrastructure this fiscal year.The strategic shift reflects AI's growing role in Microsoft's operations, with artificial intelligence now writing up to 30% of code in some company projects. Microsoft has systematically targeted middle management layers to eliminate organizational barriers and increase decision-making speed, mirroring similar restructuring efforts by Amazon and Meta.Affected employees receive comprehensive severage packages including healthcare coverage and job placement assistance, with priority consideration for other Microsoft positions. The restructuring aligns with Microsoft's new fiscal year launch, when the company traditionally announces major organisational changes.","Microsoft cuts 15,000+ jobs across multiple divisions despite record profits.

US Senator sends letter to Elon Musk: Block Starlink in Southeast Asia's 'criminal compounds' using the satellite internet service to scam Americans,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/us-senator-sends-letter-to-elon-musk-block-starlink-in-southeast-asias-criminal-compounds-using-the-satellite-internet-service-to-scam-americans/articleshow/122973251.cms,"Here’s the complete letter sent by Senator Maggie Hassan to Starlink CEO Elon Musk:

Dear Musk,

According to an October 2024 report from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, transnational criminal groups have used Starlink, a satellite internet serviced owned by SpaceX, to facilitate fraud against individuals in the United States. The U.S. Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network has warned that these groups have caused billions of dollars in losses for Americans.

In addition, since November 2022, the Secret Service has received more than 8,000 complaints related to digital asset scams, many with traces to scam networks in Southeast Asia. Given the significant financial consequences for Americans, I write today to request information about SpaceX’s efforts to prevent the misuse of Starlink in transnational fraud.

Experts have stated that scam networks in Southeast Asia turn to Starlink for its portability, decentralized infrastructure, and independence from national telecom networks. In one example, a Wired investigation found that across eight scam compounds in Myanmar, at least 412 devices identified Starlink as their provider and recorded more than 40,000 logins. In another example, one law enforcement operation in Thailand seized more than 130 Starlink devices from scam compounds around the country.

While SpaceX has stated that it investigates and deactivates Starlink devices in various contexts, it seemingly has not publicly acknowledged the use of Starlink for scams originating in Southeast Asia — or publicly discussed actions the company has taken in response. Scam networks in Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, and Laos, however, have apparently continued to use Starlink despite service rules permitting SpaceX to terminate access for fraudulent activity.

A United Nations report has confirmed that SpaceX can restrict access to Starlink through “geofencing,” making the service unavailable in specific countries or locations, but it is unclear whether the company has done so in Southeast Asia. According to one expert based in the region, “Starlink [is] failing the first basic test of business and human rights, which is to ensure that your operations do no harm.”

Transnational fraud has imposed significant human and economic costs in the United States, Southeast Asia, and around the world. According to recent estimates, scams emanating from Southeast Asia likely result in more than $43.8 billion in losses globally each year, with Americans losing $3.5 billion in 2023 alone. This fraud, often carried out by forced labor, can also cause profound psychological distress that drives victims of scams to suicide. The United Nations has also reported that scam networks in Southeast Asia force at least 220,000 trafficked individuals to carry out online scams — a situation its experts describe as a “humanitarian and human rights crisis.”

To aid Congress in understanding the scope of Starlink’s role in transnational fraud and efforts to prevent related criminal misuse of its devices, please provide responses to the following information requests. These requests cover the time period of January 1, 2020, to the present:

1. Is SpaceX aware of reports that scam networks in Southeast Asia are using Starlink to facilitate fraud? If so, when and how did SpaceX become aware of such use?

2. What are SpaceX’s policies and procedures for investigating, deactivating, or restricting Starlink devices?

3. What guardrails, policies, or procedures are in place to prevent scam networks in Southeast Asia from acquiring — directly or indirectly — Starlink devices?

4. Has SpaceX independently identified, or taken any actions in response to, indications of misuse or improper distribution of Starlink devices by purchasers or third-party intermediaries based in Southeast Asia?

5. How many third-party reports or complaints has SpaceX received concerning Starlink use in scam networks in Southeast Asia? Please break down this number by the entity issuing the report or complaint, including United States federal agencies, United Nations offices or agencies, or multilateral organizations.

a. How many of these complaints or reports, if any, led SpaceX to investigate, deactivate, or restrict Starlink devices?

b. In total, how many devices has SpaceX investigated, deactivated, or restricted due to their use in Southeast Asian scam networks?

c. How many devices has SpaceX investigated, deactivated, or restricted due to their use in fraudulent activity generally?

6. What vulnerabilities, if any, has SpaceX identified in Starlink's security protocols that bad actors, including criminal groups operating scam networks in Southeast Asia, may exploit, and what actions has the company taken to address them?

7. What steps, if any, has SpaceX taken to cooperate and work with U.S. and international law enforcement entities to address Starlink's reported use in scam networks in Southeast Asia?

8. What revenue, if any, has SpaceX generated to date related to Starlink devices that the company later investigated, deactivated, or restricted due to their use in scam networks in Southeast Asia?

'Dear Mr Elon Musk, Starlink satellite internet services are being used by criminals in Southeast Asia to scam Americans of billions,' says the letter from Democratic senator Maggie Hassan to Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk. In the long letter, Hassan urges Elon Musk to block transnational criminal groups in Southeast Asia from using Starlink satellite internet service to commit fraud against Americans. Hassan cited United Nations and other recent reports to support her claim that Starlink is being used to facilitate fraud against Americans by a broad range of transnational criminal organizations operating ""scam compounds"" in Southeast Asia. The letter asks Elon Musk to respond by August 18, 2025.","U.S. Senator Maggie Hassan sent a letter to Starlink CEO Elon Musk.

"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang sells 202,797 company shares under a pre-arranged ...",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-sells-202797-company-shares-under-a-pre-arranged-/articleshow/122972408.cms,"Explained: What is is a rule 10b5-1 trading plan

How the plan works



Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang sells $36.4 million in stock



Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has recently sold 202,797 shares of the company's stock worth approximately $39 million. According to the filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) the transactions were executed between July 24 to July 28. The shares were sold at prices ranging from $172.07 to $176.37, near Nvidia’s 52-week high of $177. Despite this sale of stock, Huang still owns more than 73.8 million shares of the company. This recent sale of stock by Huang is part of a prearranged 10b5-1 trading plan which was adopted by the Nvidia CEO in March this year. The trading plan is created to allow company insiders to sell shares without facing any accusations of insider trading. The sale is said to be a part of a planned disinvestment strategy by Huang. However, the key to understanding these sales lies in the nature of a Rule 10b5-1 plan.The rule 10b5-1 is a regulation created by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The rule enables the corporate insiders to sell company shares via a predefined trading plan. It also acts as an affirmative defense against the charges of insider trading.- Pre-planned transitions: The plan enable the insiders to establish a written trading plan at a time when they are not in possession of material non-public information (MNPI) about their company.- Specific parameters: The plan must also reveal the amount, price and date of trades or include a formula for determining them.- No discretion: Once the plan is established, after the insider cannot exercise any influence over the trades. The transactions are they automatically executed as per the pre-set schedule.- Transparency: These trading plans are disclosed publicly via the SEC filings in order to provide transparency to the market.The main objective of the rule 10b5-1 trading plan is to enable insiders to diversify their portfolios, manage liquidity and meet personal financial obligations. So, in case of Nvidia CEO selling stocks under a Rule 10b5-1 plan suggest that these transactions were scheduled well in advance before the recent market developments or company-specific news.This is the second time in July that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang sold the company stocks. Earlier in July, Huang sold 225,000 shares of company stock worth around $36.4 million. According to the recent filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the transactions were executed between July 8 and July 10. This transaction made by Huang follows the previous batch of stock which he sold in June this year. Last month Huang offloaded 1,00,000 shares in the span of two days.","N Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has sold 202,797 shares of the company's stock worth approximately $39 million.

Sundar Pichai joins the ‘billionaire club’ after leading Google for over a decade; his net worth is…,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/sundar-pichai-joins-the-billionaire-club-after-leading-google-for-over-a-decade-his-net-worth-is/articleshow/122897734.cms,"Sundar Pichai achieves rare feat as a non-founder CEO

AI-powered growth and record investments

From modest beginnings to Silicon Valley’s summit

After a decade at the helm of Alphabet, Sundar Pichai has officially joined the ranks of billionaires, marking a rare achievement for a non-founding tech CEO. Pichai, who took over as CEO of Google in 2015 and became Alphabet’s chief in 2019, now holds a net worth of $1.1 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The milestone comes after Alphabet’s market value soared by over $1 trillion since early 2023, delivering 120% returns to investors. Pichai’s rise has been defined by his leadership through multiple technological shifts, from mobile and cloud computing to AI. As Alphabet’s shares hit record highs, his decade-long stewardship has culminated in both financial success and strategic transformation.While tech billionaires are often company founders, Pichai’s entry into the billionaire club is different. He holds just 0.02% of Alphabet’s economic stake, currently valued at around $440 million. Most of his net worth comes from share sales and performance-based compensation over the past ten years. Bloomberg reports that he has sold over $650 million in stock during his tenure. If he had retained all his shares, they would now be worth more than $2.5 billion. Despite the modest stake, Pichai’s long-term vision and steady leadership have driven massive growth in Alphabet’s core businesses.August 2025 marks ten years since Pichai became CEO of Google. In that time, Alphabet has expanded rapidly, turning once-nascent divisions like YouTube, Cloud, Play, and Subscriptions into billion-dollar engines. In a recent post on X, Pichai highlighted that in 2015, Alphabet’s total revenue was $75 billion, whereas YouTube and Google Cloud alone are now generating an annual run rate of $110 billion. Under his leadership, Alphabet restructured into a parent holding company, sharpened its AI focus, and increased its global footprint.A major factor in Alphabet’s recent trillion-dollar surge has been its aggressive AI investments . The company spent $50 billion in 2023 alone on infrastructure, semiconductors, and data centers to support its AI ambitions. It also raised its 2025 capital expenditure forecast by $10 billion, reaching $85 billion, most of which is earmarked for AI infrastructure. “Our AI infrastructure investments are crucial to meeting the growth in demand for cloud customers,” Pichai said during the Q2 earnings call. Alphabet’s DeepMind acquisition in 2014 for $400 million has also paid off, helping the company stay ahead in the AI race. Pichai's rise reflects a new era where operational excellence, not just founding status, can build tech empires.Born in Tamil Nadu, India, Sundar Pichai’s journey to Silicon Valley is one of resilience and brilliance. He grew up in a two-room apartment, with his first telephone arriving when he was 12. A scholarship brought him to Stanford in 1993, with a one-way plane ticket that reportedly cost more than his father’s annual salary. Pichai joined Google in 2004, led the development of Chrome, and later oversaw Android, before rising to the top job.Sundar Pichai is also known for his calm, consensus-driven leadership style, which has earned him respect in an industry often defined by bold personalities. In recent years, he has become increasingly vocal on topics like AI regulation, digital privacy, and ethical tech, positioning Alphabet as a global thought leader beyond just innovation.Outside of tech, Pichai has also ventured into sports. He is reportedly part of a group of executives that acquired a 49% stake in the London Spirit cricket team for $182 million. The team competes in The Hundred, a professional cricket league launched in the UK in 2020. While his wealth may not rival that of Alphabet founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, worth $171.2 billion and $160.4 billion respectively, Pichai's path to the billionaire club is proof that transformational leadership, even without a founding stake, can build both companies and fortunes. His rise underscores a shift in Silicon Valley’s power dynamics—where disciplined execution rivals disruptive invention. As Alphabet charts its future, Pichai’s story stands as a model for aspiring global leaders in tech and beyond.","Sundar Pichai has officially joined the ranks of billionaires, marking a rare achievement for a non-founding tech CEO.

Time to change the working model



Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) recently announced its plans to lay off 12,000 employees which is roughly 2% of its workforce. Now, former Tech Mahindra CEO CP Gurnani has shared a thought-provoking message to the Indian tech industry. Quoting the iconic dialogue from popular Bollywood film Sholay “Kitney aadmi the?... Thank God that period will be over.” Speaking to CNBC-TV18, Gurnani has urged the tech industry to move beyond the obsession of headcount and embrace outcome-based models. Gurnani stresses on a shift from the traditional pyramid-style delivery system which has long been associated with Indian IT. He further emphasise that the Indian tech industry should prioritise enhanced productivity, specialised skills, and advanced technological capabilities.During the recent round of layoffs, TCS insists that the job cuts are not driven by AI but by skill mismatch and the need to realign talent with emerging business demands. TCS CEO K Krithivasan also clarified that the decision of the company is majorly driven by deployment feasibility and not productive gains from AI.Apart from TCS, Infosys and Wipro have also witnessed a decline in headcounters from over 12,000 and 25,000, respectively, in the past two years. Additional, HCLTech also announced restructuring at the company due to location and skill mismatches. Also, experts suggest that the roles such as low level coding, testing and documentation have now become obsolete.For decades, India's IT prowess has been built on its vast talent pool. However, as global demands shift towards more complex, niche, and AI-driven solutions, the emphasis is increasingly on quality over quantity. Former Nassscom chairman Ganesh Natarajan also spoke in support of Gurnani’s viewpoint. Natarajan called the pyramid model as ‘Jurassic Park material’. He also feels that agentic AI — software that autonomously performs complex tasks—will force companies to rethink team structures and delivery models.Analyst are also of the viewpoint that the layoffs may also increase due to the market share shifts and vendor consolidation, not just automation. The entry level jobs at BPO and customer service roles are the most vulnerable.Gurnani’s message aims to encourage Indian tech professionals to upskill and reskill and embrace new technologies.",Former Tech Mahindra CEO CP Gurnani has shared a thought-provoking message to the Indian tech industry.

Maneesh Sharma, AVP - Commodities & Currencies, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers shares his views and recommendations for gold silver investors:Gold faced four consecutive sessions of losses after rising in the initial half of last week, as the newly announced US-EU trade deal sapped demand for safe-haven assets. The US and the EU on Sunday reached a broad agreement that includes a 15% tariff on most European goods, while the US & China, the world’s two largest economies, extended their tariff truce by another three months.The risk-on sentiment weighed on the yellow metal, a traditional safe-haven asset. Meanwhile, the ECB held rates steady, while US corporates earning for Q2 continued to surpass expectations last week. Gold had reversed its gains seen in the initial half of last week and had returned to the sideways range that has dominated since late April.On the currency front, the dollar rallied and bounced from near 3 year lows seen earlier in the month on trade deal optimism as safe haven Yen continued to find buyers at lower levels for the fourth consecutive day as it climbed to a one-and-a-half-week high in early session today, around the 148.70 area.Investors brace for a busy week, featuring a Federal Reserve policy meeting followed by Bank of Japan on Thursday and a slew of economic data releases from the US.The Fed is widely expected to keep rates unchanged, but investors should closely watch for any signals of a potential rate cut in September, while rate hike signals from BoJ could also remain to be closely scrutinized.Overall, the Dollar Index looks likely to strengthen further from current levels with Yen likely to weaken against dollar on diminishing odds for an immediate interest rate hike by the Bank of Japan (BoJ). Also cooling inflation in Japan and domestic political uncertainty, could weigh on the JPY and support the USD/JPY pair.Key upside levels for the dollar are expected at $99.80 - 101.50 (CMP 98.80).

Misappropriation of funds flagged in government scheme





HYDERABAD: The Enforcement Directorate on Wednesday conducted searches at eight locations across Hyderabad in connection with the sheep-rearing scam. The searches covered premises linked to several accused, including G Kalyan, OSD to former BRS minister Talasani Srinivasa Yadav.Kalyan has been named in one of the FIRs registered by the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB). The ED initiated the probe under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), based on the FIRs filed by the ACB.The Telangana government’s Sheep Distribution and Development Scheme (SRDS), launched in 2017, aimed to supply 20 sheep and one ram per unit to shepherd families, with 75% subsidy support. Over 1.28 crore sheep were reportedly distributed during the scheme’s initial phase.However, investigations later revealed that significant amounts were misappropriated through inflated procurement bills, fake transportation records, and benami accounts. The Anti-Corruption Bureau estimated the scam to be worth around ₹700 crore.Based on its probe, the ACB booked several government officials, including Sabavath Ramachander, former managing director of the Telangana State Sheep and Goat Development Cooperative Federation (TSSGDCF), and G.Kalyan Kumar, who previously served as Officer on Special Duty (OSD) to the then minister. FIRs highlighted how funds meant for the scheme were siphoned off using forged bank accounts and shell vendors.In June 2024, the ED registered a money laundering case and began collecting documents from the animal husbandry department and the TSSGDCF, including beneficiary lists, vendor details, transport records, and payment files. The ED has since questioned key officials and begun examining financial flows to trace suspected laundering of public funds.The latest searches by ED mark an escalation in the money laundering probe, suggesting that financial links between political aides and scam beneficiaries are now under scrutiny.","The Enforcement Directorate conducted searches at eight locations across Hyderabad.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","As job cuts continue to rise in various industries, some employees are going for 'career cushioning' Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Nayara Energy – Indian refiner backed by Russia has initiated a legal action against Microsoft alleging that the US-based software giant abruptly cut off access to essential services. According to a Reuters report, the company claims that Microsoft’s move was “unilateral” and made without consultation. “Microsoft is currently restricting Nayara Energy’s access to its own data, proprietary tools, and products—despite these being acquired under fully paid-up licenses,” the company said in a statement.For those unaware, Nayara operates the country’s third-largest refinery at Vadinar in Gujarat in addition to over 6,000 fuel stations. The company typically exports at least four million barrels of refined products per month, including diesel, jet fuel, gasoline and naphtha.The dispute follows Microsoft’s decision last Tuesday to suspend services for Nayara Energy. Since then, the company's staff have reportedly been unable to access Outlook email and Microsoft Teams.Nayara claims the suspension came “without prior notice, consultation or recourse, and under the guise of compliance.”In response, Mumbai-based Nayara Energy has filed a legal petition with the Delhi High Court , seeking an interim injunction and immediate restoration of services. In its petition, the company says that the aim is to “safeguard its rights and ensure continued access to essential digital infrastructure.”Nayara Energy, a significant buyer of Russian crude, was recently sanctioned by the European Union. The company is majority-owned by Russian entities, including Rosneft. Since the sanctions were imposed, at least two ships skipped loading at its Vadinar refinery , and a tanker carrying Russian Urals crude was rerouted.Amid these challenges, Nayara’s chief executive Des Dorides resigned recently. Denisov has been with Nayara since 2017. His LinkedIn profile describes him as Nayara's chief development office. The company has appointed Sergey Denisov as the new CEO.","Nayara Energy, an Indian refiner backed by Russia, has initiated a legal action against Microsoft.

KALYAN: Around 850 contractual sanitation workers under the Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) staged a work-stoppage protest on Tuesday at the Khambalpada garbage depot. They demanded to be absorbed into Sumeet Elko, the new agency awarded the city's waste collection contract. Following discussions with civic officials and the company's management, the workers received an assurance that they would be absorbed by August 15, after which the protest was called off.Recently, KDMC handed over waste collection duties to Sumit Elko. However, around 850 contractual workers who worked in the Kalyan-Dombivli region for years were not retained by the new company, leading to discontent among the workforce.The protest received strong backing from the Shiv Sena (Thackeray faction). The party’s Kalyan district chief, Deepesh Mhatre, played a key role by initiating dialogue with KDMC officials and Sumeet Elko representatives. After the meeting, it was agreed that all existing contract workers who completed more than one year of work tenure would be absorbed into the company by August 15.Moreover, the KDMC administration also promised to clear the pending salaries of these workers at the earliest.During the protest interaction, Deepesh Mhatre claimed that there are audio clips circulating, suggesting that some individuals were demanding bribes from contract workers in exchange for securing their jobs in the company. Mhatre issued a stern warning, saying, ""If any middleman dares to ask money from sanitation workers again, they will be dealt with in true Shiv Sena style.”","Around 850 contractual sanitation workers staged a work-stoppage protest on Tuesday.

Australia will be blocking children under 16 from creating YouTube accounts starting December. This comes after the federal government reverses its earlier stance to exempt the platform from national social media restrictions for under-16s, reports the Guardian.Australian prime minister Anthony Albanese and communications minister Anika Wells are expected to formally announce the decision on Wednesday, the same day YouTube is set to host a major event for MPs at Parliament House, a move likely to spark tension with the Google-owned giant.“Social media has a social responsibility and there is no doubt that Australian kids are being negatively impacted by online platforms so I’m calling time on it,” Albanese stated. “Social media is doing social harm to our children, and I want Australian parents to know that we have their backs.”This decision follows a recommendation from the internet regulator last week, urging the government to reverse YouTube’s exemption. A survey earlier revealed that around 37 percent of minors encountered harmful content on the platform, reports Reuters.Apart from YouTube, social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok and others are on the list of age-restricted social media sites.The move comes after eSafety commissioner Julie Inman Grant highlighted findings from a recent survey of 2,600 children, revealing that nearly 40% had encountered harmful content on YouTube making it “the most frequently cited platform in our research”.The under-16 bans are set to take place in December, with platforms facing penalties of up to $49.5m if they fail to take “reasonable steps” to prevent children from creating accounts. Some major tech companies have expressed concerns over what constitutes “reasonable steps"" to comply with the new rules.The legislation only limits children from holding accounts, they will still be able to watch YouTube, notes Inman Grant.“The Albanese government is giving kids a reprieve from the persuasive and pervasive pull of social media while giving parents peace of mind,” said Anika Wells. “There’s a place for social media, but there’s not a place for predatory algorithms targeting children.”“There is no one perfect solution when it comes to keeping young Australians safer online – but the social media minimum age will make a significantly positive difference to their wellbeing,” she added.“YouTube is a video sharing platform, not a social media service, that offers benefit and value to younger Australians,” a YouTube spokesperson said on Sunday, reports the Guardian.",Australia will be blocking children under 16 from creating YouTube accounts starting December.

Julia Hyman, Aland Etienne, Wesley LePatner and Didarul Islam were identified as the four victims of the ghastly NYC shooting at 345 Park Avenue. They all worked separately but Monday evening, all four of them were in front of the crazed gunman Shane Tamura at some point. While Didarul Islam was a Bangadeshi-origin police officer, Aland Etienne was a security guard, Julia Hyman worked for Rudin Management, the company that owns the Midtown skyscraper, and Wesley LePatner was a senior executive of Blackstone which has its office in the same building.Julia Hyman was a 27-year-old Cornell grad who had been working as a Rudin associate for less than a year. The killer reportedly took a wrong elevator and reached the floor of Rudin Management, where he encountered Julia Hyman and shot her dead. Investigators believe Shane Tamura, the shooter, wanted to attack the NFL's office but accidentally ended up on a different floor.Hyman was the last person to be killed before the killer shot himself.“The Rudin family and everyone at our company are devastated by yesterday’s senseless tragedy,” a Rudin rep said in a statement.“Our thoughts and prayers are with those injured and lost last night, including our cherished Rudin colleague, a brave New York City police officer, a beloved lobby security guard and an employee at a tenant firm.Aland Etienne, 46, was identified as of four innocent victims killed by Tamura as he entered 345 Park Avenue. He worked as an unarmed security guard. He was hiding behind a desk to take cover as Tamura opened fire in the lobby. A Haiti native, Etienne had five brothers, a sister, an older daughter and a young boy just days away from his seventh birthday, NY Post reported. Aland was the third person to be killed. After killing him, the shooter took the wrong lift.A senior executive of Blackstone, Wesley LePatner, was killed when she was hiding behind a pillar in the building's lobby. LePatner was the Global Head of Core+ Real Estate and CEO of Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust.A mother of two, LePatner had a distinguished career including over a decade at Goldman Sachs and a summa cum laude degree from Yale University.In a note to staff, Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman and President Jon Gray called it the ""worst day in the firm's 40 year history,"" according to people who saw the memo, Reuters reported. Executives have been assured by New York City Police that the firm was not the intended target of the attack.Didarul Islam, 36, was shot dead while providing security for the site on Park Avenue. He was the first victim of the mass shooting. Officials said he had migrated to the US from Bangladesh, had two children and was expecting a third with his pregnant wife. He died ""a hero"", they said.Paying tribute to the late officer, New York Mayor Eric Adams said he was ""doing what he does best... saving lives.
