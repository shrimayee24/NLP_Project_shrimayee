Global Buddhist Summit delegates to be honoured



NEW DELHI: India on Monday celebrates its 77th Republic Day with ceremonial events to begin early morning at Kartavya Path, where the national flag will be unfurled by the President and the annual parade will showcase the country’s military strength, cultural diversity and developmental journey.The celebrations will take place along the Kartavya Path stretch from Rashtrapati Bhavan to the National War Memorial, carrying the themes ‘Swatantrata ka Mantra: Vande Mataram’ and ‘Samriddhi ka Mantra: Aatmanirbhar Bharat’. This year’s parade also commemorates 150 years of Vande Mataram, the national song.Adding diplomatic significance to the celebrations, president of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen and president of the European Council Antonio Luís Santos da Costa are attending the Republic Day celebrations as chief guests. The two leaders are on a state visit to India from January 25 to 27 at the invitation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.The parade will also feature a European Union contingent comprising four flag bearers on three gypsies, carrying the flag of the European Union, the EU military staff flag, and the flags of EU naval force Atalanta and EU naval force Aspides.Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, was born in 1958 and is a medical doctor by training.She has served in public office for over two decades and held several key ministerial portfolios in Germany between 2005 and 2019, including family and youth, labour and defence.She assumed office as president of the European Commission in 2019 and was re-elected for a second term in July 2024. In her current mandate, she is focused on strengthening Europe’s competitiveness, democratic institutions, and defence and security capabilities.Speaking recently, von der Leyen said, “Europe and India have chosen strategic partnership, dialogue and openness,” adding that the two sides are “building mutual resilience.”At the World Economic Forum in Davos, she said the European Union is close to finalising a free trade agreement with India. “There is still work to do. But we are on the cusp of a historic trade agreement. Some call it the mother of all deals. One that would create a market of 2 billion people, accounting for almost a quarter of global GDP,” she said.EU commissioner for Trade Maros Sefcovic has said that negotiations on the FTA are nearing conclusion. Foreign affairs expert Robinder Sachdev noted that the agreement has been under discussion for over two decades.Antonio Luís Santos da Costa, President of the European Council, was born in Lisbon in 1961 and is a senior Portuguese political leader. He comes from a family with Portuguese, Indian and Mozambican roots and holds a law degree from the University of Lisbon.Costa joined the Portuguese Socialist Party early in his career and went on to serve in several key roles, including minister for parliamentary affairs, minister for justice, member and vice-president of the European parliament, minister of state and minister for the interior, and mayor of Lisbon.He served as Prime Minister of Portugal from 2015 for nine years, during which the country saw stable economic growth, reduced unemployment, sound public finances and increased investment in renewable energy. He assumed office as president of the European Council in December 2024.During the visit, India and the European Union are expected to unveil a security and defence strategic partnership, along with expected discussions on free trade agreement. The agreement is set to be signed by EU high representative and vice-president Kaja Kallas and defence minister Rajnath Singh, making it only the third such comprehensive defence partnership the EU has signed in Asia, after Japan and the Republic of Korea.An EU official described the current phase of ties as a “culmination of remarkable intensifying relations,” noting that both sides now recognise that their security and prosperity are closely linked in a changing global environment.A large group of monks and nuns from 40 countries who attended the two-day Global Buddhist Summit in New Delhi will be among the 'honoured guests,' according to the culture ministry.The summit, organised by the International Buddhist Confederation (IBC) in collaboration with the ministry on January 24 and 25, was held under the theme ‘Collective Wisdom, United Voice, and Mutual Coexistence’.According to the ministry, the gathering reflected India’s message from the land of the Buddha advocating peaceful resolution of conflicts, addressing global inequalities and responding to ecological challenges.Speaking at a press conference on Sunday, IBC secretary general Ven Shartse Khensur Rinpoche Jangchup Choeden said, “At the parade, India will be displaying its might, but it is also the land of Buddha Dhamma, spreading the message of peace, love, and kindness to many countries in the world.” He added, “We believe in the power of compassion and care. We need peace in the world today and friendly coexistence.”The summit brought together over 800 delegates from 40 countries, including more than 200 overseas participants and around 100 members of the Sangha, along with diplomats, academicians, scholars and lay practitioners from India.(With inputs from agencies)","The celebrations will take place along the Kartavya Path stretch from Rashtrapati Bhavan to the National War Memorial.

From Planning Room to Precision Strike: The Vir Chakra Story of Wing Cdr Joy Chandra | I Witness

NEW DELHI: Kargil war hero Subedar Major and honorary Lieutenant Sanjay Kumar has been given the rank of honorary captain for his long, selfless service to the Army. The Param Vir Chakra recipient is among 2,241 JCOs of the Army who have been conferred honorary commissioned ranks on the eve of Republic Day.Kumar is a legendary officer (13 JAK Rifles) who was awarded India's highest gallantry honour for his heroics in the 1999 Kargil war. On July 4, 1999, he had single-handedly captured Flat Top, Point 4875, by neutralising enemy machine-gun posts despite severe injuries. Kumar's name resonates far beyond military circles for his courage and bravery during the India-Pakistan war.At least 437 JCOs have been elevated to honorary captain rank, while 1,804 JCOs have been conferred the rank of honorary lieutenant, recognising their decades of selfless military service, according to an official notification.Honorary ranks in the Army are conferred on JCOs with impeccable service records who have displayed professional excellence and sterling leadership qualities at unit level. While these ranks - honorary lieutenant and honorary captain- do not alter command structures, they carry deep symbolic value within the armed forces.The number of those given the honour this year highlights the oft-neglected contributions of subedars and subedar majors, who form the bedrock of the Army's functioning. They train young soldiers, preserve regimental traditions, enforce discipline and provide continuity in some of the most challenging operational environments in the world. In addition to the honour and protocol status, these ranks can result in a modest enhancement in pension benefits, depending on applicable rules.",Kumar is a legendary officer (13 JAK Rifles) who was awarded India's highest gallantry honour for his heroics in the 1999 Kargil war.

Latest Income Tax Slabs FY 2025–26 (Under New Income Tax Regime)

Old Vs New Income Tax Regime: How Much More Tax Are You Saving Over Years?

These charts by EY have been prepared on the following assumptions:

Section 80C deduction (maximum Rs 1.5 lakh) considered under the old tax regime. Other deductions/ exemptions such as medical insurance, home loan interest, house rent allowance are not considered. Standard deduction of Rs 50000 under the old regime and standard deduction as notified from time to time (Nil, Rs 50,000, Rs 75,000) under new regime is considered.

Each year the Budget speech is eagerly watched and listened to by the common man and middle class taxpayers, seeking answer to a simple query: will my tax burden reduce this year? Even finance ministers presenting the Budget are aware of the populist impact of their speech, in case tax relief measures are announced.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the Union Budget on February 1. Will tax slab and tax rate changes be introduced? Sitharaman, who will present her ninth budget, is also the FM who introduced the new income tax regime back in 2020.The choice between the old and the new income tax regime is an important one and every year, taxpayers carefully calculate the tax liability under each before deciding on which one to opt for.Over the years, the new income tax regime has seen several changes, and the tax liability under it has progressively come down at various salary levels, and it has become increasingly more attractive compared to the old regime.In her Budget speech in 2020, FM Nirmala Sitharaman explained the rationale for the introduction of a new income tax regime: the need for simpler compliance.“...The Income Tax Act is riddled with various exemptions and deductions which make compliance by the taxpayer and administration of the Income Tax Act by the tax authorities a burdensome process. It is almost impossible for a taxpayer to comply with the Income-tax law without taking help from professionals,” she said.Hence, a new and simplified income tax regime was introduced to provide “significant relief” to individual taxpayers. The idea was for a tax regime that offers reduced rates for taxpayers who forgo certain deductions and exemptions.The biggest takeaway was that the 30% tax slab under the new regime kicked in at an income above Rs 15 lakh compared to Rs 10 lakh under the old tax regime.At that time individuals under both regimes earning income up to Rs 5 lakh did not have to pay tax with the benefit of Section 87A.FM Sitharaman explained the gains: In the new tax regime, substantial tax benefit will accrue to a taxpayer depending upon exemptions and deductions claimed by him. For example, a person earning Rs 15 lakh in a year and not availing any deductions etc. will pay only Rs 1,95,000 as compared to Rs 2,73,000 in the old regime. Thus his tax burden shall be reduced by 78,000 in the new regime. He would still be the gainer in the new regime even if he was taking deduction of Rs 1.5 Lakh under various sections of Chapter- VI-A of the Income Tax Act under the old regime.Over the years, the government has introduced substantial changes under the new income tax regime - introduction of standard deduction benefits, higher standard deduction limit of Rs 75,000, evolving tax slabs and tax rates.In the Union Budget 2023, tax slabs under the new regime were further tweaked to:Importantly the following big changes were introduced:In the interim budget of 2024, the standard deduction under the new regime was raised to Rs 75,000.Last year, FM Sitharaman’s Budget brought sweeping changes in the new income tax regime, making it even more attractive for taxpayers. With higher rebate, tax outgo on income up to Rs 12 lakh was reduced to ZERO!Explaining the journey, Sitharaman said, “Right after 2014, the ‘Nil tax’ slab was raised to Rs 2.5 lakh, which was further raised to Rs 5 lakh in 2019 and to Rs 7 lakh in 2023. This is reflective of our government's trust on the middle-class tax payers. I am now happy to announce that there will be no income tax payable up to income of Rs 12 lakh (i.e. average income of Rs 1 lakh per month other than special rate income such as capital gains) under the new regime. This limit will be Rs 12.75 lakh for salaried tax payers, due to standard deduction of Rs 75,000.”Income tax slabs under the new regime saw big changes, with the 30% tax slab now kicking in for incomes above Rs 24 lakh, as against Rs 15 lakh earlier.One noteworthy point is that in all these years since the introduction of the new income tax regime, the old tax regime with higher deductions and exemptions but also higher tax rates continues to function, though without any changes. The intent of the government is clear: with the new tax regime made the default regime, and all changes and benefits of lower taxes, taxpayers are being urged to shift to it.But, how much is the tax benefit under the new tax regime compared to the old regime? The tax outgo has changed in the last 5 years, and at various income levels, the tax outgo under the new regime has come down substantially compared to the old tax regime.For a better understanding, we take a look at how tax outgo has changed over the last five years at various income levels of Rs 10 lakh, Rs 20 lakh, and Rs 40 lakh.If for an income level of Rs 10 lakh, you had to pay Rs 75,400 in FY21 under the old tax regime, the tax outgo under the new regime has come down from Rs 78,000 in FY21 to Rs 54,600 in FY24, Rs 44,200 in FY25 to NIL in FY26! It continues to be Rs 75,400 under the old regime.Similarly, if for an income level of Rs 20 lakh, you had to pay Rs 366,600 in FY21 under the old tax regime, the tax outgo under the new regime has come down from Rs 351,000 in FY21 to Rs 296,400 in FY24, Rs 278,200 in FY25 to Rs 192,400 in FY26! So in FY26, if you opt for the new regime, instead of the old, your tax savings would be Rs 174,200!The impact is also visible at higher income levels. If for an income level of Rs 40 lakh, you had to pay Rs 990,600 in FY21 under the old tax regime, the tax outgo under the new regime has come down from Rs 975,000 in FY21 to Rs 920,400 in FY24, Rs 902,200 in FY25 to Rs 787,800 in FY26! So in FY26, if you opt for the new regime, instead of the old, your tax savings would be Rs 202,800!The above charts are broadly indicative, and the tax outgo will depend on your income level, the amount of deductions and exemptions you claim. For an income of over Rs 12 lakh, and above a certain amount of deductions and exemptions, the old regime may be more suitable at various salary levels.Hence, while the above examples offer a clear picture on how the tax benefits have increased over years under the new regime, it is important to calculate the total amount of deductions and exemptions you avail for a better understanding.As an example, at the current tax slabs in the old and new regime, if you have a gross income of more than Rs 24.75 lakh, then the old regime makes sense only if your total deductions and exemptions are over Rs 8 lakh.This level of deductions and exemptions is for the 30% tax slab. It will vary for incomes below Rs 24 lakh.Amarpal Chadha, Tax Partner at EY India tells TOI, “Over the past few years, the new tax regime has clearly boosted the take‑home pay of most salaried taxpayers due to the rising basic exemption limits and reduced slab rates. In FY 2020-21, for an income of Rs 10 lakh, the tax liability under the new tax regime was slightly higher compared to the old tax regime. However, over the subsequent five years (FY 2021-22 to FY 2025-26), the reforms have reversed this picture, resulting in savings of Rs 75,400 in FY 2025-26 under the new tax regime as compared to the old tax regime. ”""For an income of Rs 20 lakh and Rs 40 lakh, the savings in FY 2025-26 are approximately Rs 1.74 lakh and Rs 2.02 lakh respectively as compared to the old tax regime. Now, if we compare savings under the new tax regime over the six-year period (FY 2020-21 to FY 2025-26), savings have risen significantly — around Rs 78,000 at an income of Rs 10 lakh, Rs 1.58 lakh at Rs 20 lakh and Rs 1.87 lakh at Rs 40 lakh. With substantial taxpayers going ahead with the default/new tax regime, further slab adjustments in Budget 2026 could accelerate this trend,” he adds.While a certain percentage of taxpayers continue to benefit from the old tax regime, for example those who claim high levels of House Rent Allowance, or those who have a home loan, over 70% of tax returns filed for AY 2024-25 were under the new regime. Tax experts expect more taxpayers to switch to the new income tax regime in the ongoing financial year, with the Rs 12 lakh zero tax level prompting many to shift.However, experts note that the government may look to introduce some popular deductions and exemptions such as Section 80C and home loan interest benefits to incentivise savings and housing.","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the Union Budget on February 1. Will tax slab and tax rate changes be introduced? Will tax relief measures be announced? The choice between the old and the new income tax regime is an important one and every year, taxpayers carefully calculate the tax liability.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127475885,imgsize-113754,width-400,resizemode-4/old-vs-new-income-tax-regime.jpg"

NEW DELHI: With the Iran crisis simmering, IndiGo has cancelled its Tbilisi, Almaty, Tashkent and Baku flights till Jan 28. Air India, which had been overflying the safer eastern parts of Iran on its flights to and from North America, will now examine the situation once the same resume after the snowstorm on the east coast in a day or so.“In view of the prevailing situation and after careful assessment, IndiGo flights scheduled to operate on Jan 26, 27 and 28, 2026, to and from Tbilisi, Almaty, Tashkent and Baku have been cancelled,” IndiGo said on X Sunday.Air India flights to and from Europe had stopped overflying Iran after a Jan 16 advisory from European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). “Given the ongoing situation and the potential for US military action, which has placed Iranian air defence forces on a heightened state of alert, there is currently an increased likelihood of misidentification within (Iranian airspace). The presence and possible use of a wide range of weapons and air-defence systems, combined with unpredictable state responses and the potential activation of SAM systems, creates a high risk to civil flights operating at all altitudes and flight levels…. Air operators should not operate within the airspace of Iran at all altitudes and flight levels,” EASA advisory had said.AI has since then not been overflying Iran on flights to and from Europe as the advisory is for ""third country operators authorised by EASA, when conducting operations to, from and within the EU.” AI and many other airlines are overflying Iraq. Once East Coast flights resume, AI will take a call based on the situation that time regarding overflying the safer eastern part of Iran.The situation is dynamic and airlines are taking decisions in real time, very frequently changing course of their enroute flights in troubled West Asia","IndiGo has cancelled its Tbilisi, Almaty, Tashkent and Baku flights till Jan 28.

Trump's H-1B Visa Chaos: Jobs At Risk, Families Traumatised As Wait Pushed To Late 2026

No hope of US visa situation improving: Immigration experts



NEW DELHI: No new H-1B stamping dates seem to be available this calendar year and new interview dates are being deferred to 2027, creating major disruptions for Indian professionals working in the US. Visa offices in Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Hyderabad & Kolkata no longer have regular interview slots available.Immigration experts said there is no hope of the situation getting better. The US state department website simply shows 'not available' as the waiting period for next available appointment for interview required for petition-based (H, L, O, P, Q) visas in many places across the world, including Kolkata and Delhi.Those who had their interview dates in Jan & Feb also received emails for their respective consulates that their dates have been moved to April-May 2027.The pile-up is happening with the Trump administration reworking the H1-B programme. On Dec 29, 2025, US Citizenship and Immigration Services had published new rules for FY 2027.The annual cap of 85,000 visas remains unchanged, including 20,000 reserved for applicants with US postgraduate degrees.Apart from this, there have been overall changes in the Trump’s ever-tightening visa policies. US has introduced mandatory social media screening for visa applicants. The added scrutiny increased processing time per applicant and reduced the number of interviews consulates can conduct each day. The US no longer allows visa stamping in third countries, barring a few exceptions. That means the entire demand has to be met by consulates in India for Indians and has added to delays.Immigration attorney Emily Neumann said she did not hear about any new visa interview slots opening for India in the last 50 days. Neumann said H-1Bs who are in the US should not even try to get an appointment for visa stamping in India.“They are not in any hurry to give you a visa. They are trying to deny visas whenever they can. It is a completely different world from what we saw during the Biden administration. This administration does not want to give you visa,” Neumann said.Amid the delay in stamping, US State Department is also revoking visas prudentially, and H-4 visa holders are also getting their visas revoked because of their H-1B spouses.","No new H-1B stamping dates seem to be available this calendar year.

""A Game-Changer for Trade and Defense"" Expert on India-EU Free Trade Agreement

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi’s discussions with EU leaders this week will herald a new chapter in bilateral ties, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said as he welcomed European Council and Commission presidents, Antonio Costa and Ursula von der Leyen respectively, in a meeting.The leaders, who were treated to a ceremonial welcome Sunday shortly after Costa’s arrival, will attend the January 26 Republic Day parade as chief guests, ahead of the 16th EU-India summit on Tuesday. The summit takes place at a time Europe’s transatlantic alliance is under strain and India too is in the crosshairs of President Donald Trump’s trade policies.Shortly after the welcome ceremony, von der Leyen said in a post on X India and Europe had made a clear choice – the choice of strategic partnership, dialogue and openness. “Leveraging our complementary strengths. And building mutual resilience.We are showing a fractured world that another way is possible,” said the president.The summit will see four major outcomes – successful conclusion of the FTA negotiations although the deal itself would be signed later, signing of a security and defence partnership that von der Leyen in an interview to TOI described as a likely game-changer, an agreement to promote mobility and adoption of a 2026-2030 joint comprehensive strategic agenda.Jaishankar later also met his counterpart Kaja Kallas and said the talks reflected growing comfort and strong convergences.According to senior EU officials accompanying the leaders, both sides were closing in on the conclusion of the trade talks that would result in the “mother of all deals”. Von der Leyen had told TOI ahead of her arrival EU was committed to finding workable, mutually beneficial solutions on issues such as CBAM (EU carbon border tax), automobiles, and steel.According to Brussels, the new strategic agenda will look to ramp up cooperation across 4 key pillars - prosperity and sustainability, technology and innovation, security and defence and connectivity and global issues.Under the new security and defence partnership, which the EU has so far signed with only 8 “trusted and like-minded countries, both sides will also announce the launch of negotiations for a Security of Information Agreement that would facilitate the exchange of classified information. Von der Leyen, however, also told TOI while the partnership will help diversify military supply chains and improve access to new capabilities, EU member-states will retain their authority on export of high-end technology. “The export of high-end defence technology is, and will remain, a national competence,” she had said. The partnership will allow both sides to eplore defence industrial collaboration and facilitate India’s participation in EU security and defence initiatives in line with EU Treaty-based frameworks.With the new mobility agreement, EU is also hoping to attract more highly skilled professionals, researchers and students to Europe, while blocking illegal migration. In all, 8-10 agreements are expected to be signed at the summit. The ministry of external affairs called India-EU relations a partnership of trust and reliability.The strategic agenda along with a joint statement will reaffirm both sides’ commitment to effective multilateralism and a free and open Indo-Pacific. The leaders will also discuss the need to bring the Russia-Ukraine war to an end and the situation in West Asia. EU leaders are likely to urge Modi to provide more humanitarian assistance to Ukraine.","PM Narendra Modi's discussions with EU leaders this week will herald a new chapter in bilateral ties, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said.

Beyond the rulebook

When the University Grants Commission ( UGC ), the statutory body under the Union education ministry that regulates universities and colleges, notified its Promotion of Equity in Higher Education Institutions Regulations, 2026, it introduced a new set of rules that will apply across campuses nationwide.The regulations govern how colleges and universities must prevent, identify, and respond to discrimination involving students, teachers, and staff.On paper, the objective sounds straightforward. It seeks to ensure that no student, teacher, or staff member is denied dignity or opportunity in higher education because of identity.In practice, however, the new regulations reach deep into the everyday functioning of campuses, shaping everything from admissions and hostels to classrooms, committees, and corridors.The 2026 framework replaces the UGC’s earlier equity rules and shifts the burden of compliance squarely onto institutions and their leadership.Heads of universities and colleges are no longer just administrators; they are now the first line of accountability in preventing and responding to discrimination. New structures, new reporting mechanisms, and strict timelines are written into the rulebook, backed by the threat of serious penalties for non-compliance.Yet, as has often been the case with regulations aimed at correcting long-standing social inequities, the real questions lie beneath the stated intent.How wide is the definition of discrimination? How much discretion do institutional committees enjoy? What happens when complaints are contested, or when the process itself causes harm? And how prepared are campuses to balance speed, sensitivity, and fairness? And is it discriminatory against the non-reserved General Class students?The objective clause sets the tone for the entire framework. It seeks to eradicate discrimination only on specified grounds like religion, race, caste, gender, place of birth, and disability.The word “only” is significant, as it confines the scope of the regulations to discrimination based on specified identity grounds, excluding general grievances or academic disputes.At the same time, the regulations explicitly prioritise certain groups, including:This prioritisation reflects a remedial approach, focusing on historically disadvantaged communities, while formally keeping the protection available to all stakeholders.The definitions section is one of the most consequential parts of the regulations.“Discrimination” is defined broadly to include not only explicit acts but also implicit, indirect, or structural forms of unfair treatment.It extends to actions that have the effect of impairing equality or violating human dignity, even if discriminatory intent is not overt.“Caste-based discrimination” is defined as discrimination against members of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and Other Backward Classes.Importantly, the regulation does not create separate categories of discrimination for different groups but subsumes them within a common framework.“Equity” is defined as providing a level playing field for all stakeholders with respect to rights and opportunities.Together, these definitions significantly expand the interpretive space available to committees tasked with examining complaints. At the same time, the breadth of these definitions leaves substantial discretion with institutional committees.Terms such as implicit or indirect discrimination, structural unfairness, and impairment of dignity are not further qualified in the regulations, offering limited guidance on thresholds of proof or standards of assessment.This ambiguity may allow flexibility in addressing complex forms of disadvantage, but it also opens the door to uneven interpretation across institutions, particularly in contested cases where intent is disputed or where academic or administrative decisions intersect with allegations of discrimination.Every higher education institution (HEI) is required to establish an Equal Opportunity Centre (EOC). The Centre is tasked with a wide range of functions, including policy implementation, counselling, outreach, awareness-building, and grievance handling.Smaller colleges that lack sufficient faculty strength are allowed to rely on the EOC of their affiliating university, ensuring that the requirement applies uniformly across institutions.The EOC is also expected to coordinate with civil society organisations, local administration, police authorities, and legal services bodies. This expansive mandate reflects an attempt to situate campus equity within a broader social and legal ecosystem.Each Equal Opportunity Centre (EOC) must have an Equity Committee, constituted by the head of the institution. Its composition is carefully structured to include:The regulations mandate representation of women, SCs, STs, OBCs, and persons with disabilities within the committee. The committee is required to meet at least twice a year and to review action taken on complaints.The committee’s core role is to inquire into allegations of discrimination and submit a report with findings and recommendations.Beyond formal committees, the regulations introduce two novel mechanisms: Equity Squads and Equity Ambassadors.Equity Squads are smaller, mobile bodies tasked with maintaining vigilance and visiting “vulnerable spots” on campus. Equity Ambassadors are designated individuals in departments, hostels, libraries, and other units who act as nodal points for reporting violations.These mechanisms signal a shift towards continuous monitoring, rather than complaint-driven intervention alone. While intended as preventive measures, they also raise questions about overreach, informal surveillance, and the potential chilling effect on campus interactions.Every HEI must operate a round-the-clock Equity Helpline. Any stakeholder in distress due to discrimination can access it, and confidentiality of the complainant’s identity must be maintained if requested.Where a prima facie case under penal law is disclosed, the information is to be forwarded to the police. This provision effectively links campus grievance mechanisms with the criminal justice system, raising the stakes for both complainants and the accused.The procedure for handling discrimination complaints is tightly time-bound.An aggrieved person can report an incident through an online portal, email, written complaint, or the helpline. Upon receipt, the Equity Committee must meet within 24 hours to decide on the next steps.The committee has 15 working days to submit its report, after which the head of the institution has seven working days to initiate action. In cases involving the head of the institution, the coordinator of the EOC chairs the inquiry.While the timelines aim to ensure prompt action, they also raise concerns about whether complex allegations can be examined thoroughly within such compressed periods.Any person aggrieved by the Equity Committee’s report can appeal to the Ombudsperson within 30 days. The Ombudsperson may appoint an amicus curiae and is expected to dispose of appeals within another 30 days.This appellate mechanism provides an external check on institutional processes. However, it primarily addresses procedural correctness, rather than offering substantive relief for non-tangible harms such as reputational damage or mental distress.The regulations empower the UGC to monitor compliance through inspections, information requests, and national-level committees. Non-compliant institutions face serious consequences, including:These penalties indicate that equity compliance is not optional, but a condition for institutional legitimacy.Despite the breadth of the framework, the regulations are silent on several issues that are likely to shape their reception and operation on campuses. While they lay out detailed mechanisms for receiving and processing complaints, they do not spell out comparable safeguards for non-reserved individuals who may be accused of discrimination, particularly in cases where allegations are contested or later found to be unsubstantiated.There is no explicit provision dealing with malicious or knowingly false complaints, nor is there any guidance on how institutions should distinguish between bona fide grievances and those driven by personal disputes, academic disagreements, or animosity unrelated to identity-based discrimination. The absence of such clarity places a significant burden on institutional committees to exercise judgment, increasing the risk of inconsistent outcomes across campuses.The regulations also do not acknowledge the mental and reputational impact that the complaint process itself can have on the accused. There are no provisions for interim confidentiality for respondents, counselling support during the inquiry, or mechanisms to repair reputational harm if allegations are ultimately not upheld. In tightly knit academic environments, even the initiation of an inquiry can have lasting professional and psychological consequences, irrespective of the final outcome.Another area of concern relates to timelines. While the emphasis on speed is intended to ensure prompt redressal for complainants, the compressed schedule may limit the ability of committees to examine complex factual disputes, especially those involving academic judgment or administrative discretion. In such cases, the pressure to meet deadlines could inadvertently prioritise procedural closure over substantive fairness.The linkage of campus mechanisms with law enforcement, particularly through the equity helpline, further raises the stakes. While intended to ensure swift action in serious cases, this provision may deter open academic engagement or encourage defensive decision-making by administrators wary of escalation beyond the institution.Historically, similar regulatory frameworks in higher education and other sectors have tended to correct outcomes through appellate or judicial review, while leaving the harms caused during the process largely unaddressed. Appeals may overturn findings or set aside penalties, but they rarely compensate for stress, stigma, or disruption suffered in the interim. In the absence of explicit procedural safeguards, this gap is likely to remain.Taken together, these omissions do not negate the objectives of the regulations, but they point to areas where further clarification or supplementary guidelines may be required. How these concerns are handled, whether through institutional practice, regulatory advisories, or future amendments, will play a key role in determining whether the framework strengthens trust on campuses or becomes a source of sustained friction.The question arises because the regulations draw explicit distinctions by prioritising protections for historically disadvantaged groups, while applying a common framework to all stakeholders.Article 14 guarantees equality before the law, but past judicial practice has allowed differential treatment where it is linked to a legitimate objective and applied through non-arbitrary procedures. In that sense, the regulations are framed as remedial rather than exclusionary, focusing on identity-based disadvantage in higher education.However, concerns stem less from the stated objective and more from the structure of implementation. The wide discretion granted to institutional committees, combined with broadly worded definitions of discrimination and the absence of explicit safeguards for those accused, particularly from the unreserved General Class, has led some to question whether outcomes could vary unevenly across campuses. Critics argue that unequal application, rather than unequal text, could create situations where similarly placed individuals are treated differently in practice.The 2026 equity regulations introduce a far-reaching framework for addressing discrimination and inclusion in higher education, expanding the role of institutional mechanisms and regulatory oversight. They formalise a set of duties, procedures, and enforcement tools that universities and colleges will be required to follow.However, the way the framework functions in practice will depend on how institutions interpret and apply its provisions. The manner in which discretion is exercised, timelines are enforced, and contested complaints are handled will shape whether the regulations operate as intended or generate friction within campuses.","Promotion of Equity in Higher Education Institutions Regulations, 2026. The regulations govern how colleges and universities must prevent, identify, and respond to discrimination involving students, teachers, and staff. The regulation does not create separate categories of discrimination for different groups but subsumes them within a common framework.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127388943,imgsize-100582,width-400,resizemode-4/ugc.jpg"

Throwback 25: Five Indian Weapons That Crushed Terror And Dominated Pakistan in Operation Sindoor

NEW DELHI: India’s air superiority during its “88-hour Operation Sindoor coerced Pakistan into a ceasefire” during the May 7-10, 2025 conflict, according to a detailed European military analysis.The report, titled ‘Operation Sindoor: The India-Pakistan Air War (7–10 May 2025)’, has been authored by Adrien Fontanellaz and was published last week by the Centre d’Histoire et de Prospective Militaires (CHPM), an independent Swiss military history and strategic studies institution based in Switzerland. Founded in 1969, CHPM is not affiliated with any govt and positions itself as a neutral forum for professional military research.Referring to last year’s Indo-Pak conflict, the report said, “This (May 2025) clash between the Pakistan and Indian air force s initially saw the former achieve a clear tactical victory by shooting down several enemy fighters, then largely fail in its conduct of strikes over Indian territory, as those were countered by an integrated air defence system whose effectiveness was one of the surprises of the conflict. Conversely, the Indian Air Force managed to significantly degrade the enemy's air defence system, then concluded the conflict by carrying out a series of spectacular strikes against Pakistan’s principal Air Force stations.Thus, by achieving clear air superiority, India coerced Islamabad into requesting a ceasefire .”Though the Indian govt never admitted losing any fighter aircraft, including Rafale, in the conflict, the report said, “The loss of at least one Indian Rafale fighter jet on the night of 7 May 2025, can be seen as the tip of the iceberg as this event, above all, made a strong impression in the West and attracted significant media attention. However, this sequence saw a large-scale confrontation between two competent air forces, equipped with small fleets of state-of-the-art aircraft designs, such as the J10C and the Rafale, supported by substantial fleets of fourth-generation combat aircraft as well as sophisticated integrated air defence networks and force multipliers. ”On the escalation of war, the report stated, “On the strategic plane, Operation Sindoor has led to conventional military clashes of considerable magnitude between two de facto nuclear-weapon states with differing doctrines regarding the use of nuclear weapons, which made the situation very tricky to handle, with a high risk of escalation and potentially catastrophic consequences.”“This episode provides valuable lessons on the tactical and operational plans, particularly because it illustrates the strong interpenetration between the military and communication lines of operation, as well as a paradigm that has been consistently confirmed over the years, namely the crucial role of long-range strikes,” the report further added.","India’s air superiority during its “88-hour Operation Sindoor coerced Pakistan into a ceasefire” during the May 7-10, 2025 conflict, according to a detailed European military analysis.

The stage is decorated... there is lighting, music... there is all the pomp and show, and the atmosphere is no less than a concert.It feels like a huge concert, but what is being sung there is the resonance of bhajans sung with complete concentration, dedication, and rhythm. This trend is being called ‘bhajan-clubbing’ today, and it’s becoming increasingly popular, especially among Gen Z,” he added.Modi also praised the efforts of the Indian community in Malaysia towards language diversity in schools, highlighting that now there are more than 500 Tamil schools in Malaysia. In addition to teaching the Tamil language, other subjects are also taught in Tamil. In his address, PM also lauded the UAE’s initiative to declare 2026 as the ‘Year of the Family’, likening it to India’s family system which is part of the country’s traditions.Reiterating the govt’s thrust on manufacturing high quality products in India, PM urged industry and start-ups to focus on quality and resolve to make excellence a benchmark in manufacturing. “Let us resolve to improve the quality of whatever we manufacture. Be it our textiles, technology, electronics or even packaging; an Indian product should become synonymous with top quality,” he said. “The era of ‘it just happens” and “it will go through somehow’ (chalta hai) is over. Come, let us prioritise quality with all our might this year. Let our only mantra be quality, quality and only quality,” Modi said.","PM Narendra Modi praised the youth for embracing the emerging trend of ‘bhajan- clubbing’ He said it is a powerful blend of devotion, culture, spirituality and modernity that resonates strongly with Gen Z. ‘Bhajans’ have been the soul of Indian culture for centuries, he said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127507426,imgsize-605257,width-400,resizemode-4/image-ians.jpg"

ED attaches 37 properties of Pearl Agro,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ed-attaches-37-properties-of-pearl-agro/articleshow/127515574.cms,"Image: IANS

NEW DELHI: Pearl Agro Corp Ltd, a multi-level marketing firm that promised plot allotments to lakhs across the country and deceived investors and regulators for nearly two decades, raised more than Rs 60,000 crore and siphoned off most of it into personal assets in India and abroad, according to an ED probe report. On Sunday, ED said it has managed to locate 37 properties of the accused in Ludhiana and Jaipur worth Rs 2,000 crore and attached these.The total attachment in the case has reached Rs 7,600 crore, ED said. The fresh attachment includes a prime land close to Jaipur airport worth over Rs 1,500 crore, sources said. In less than two months, between Dec and now, the agency has attached assets of PACL and its promoter Nirmal Singh Bhangoo, worth over Rs 6,000 crore, in its ongoing money laundering investigation in the case.An estimate by Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), which is also probing the case, revealed that nearly six crore investors have been cheated by Bhangoo and his associates over the past two decades. The magnitude of the crime is such that Supreme Court constituted a committee headed by Justice RM Lodha to ensure smooth restitution of lost money through the sale of assets attached by ED.The main accused and promoter of PACL, Bhangoo, has died and his wife Prem Kaur, two daughters Barinder and Sukhwinder Kaur, son-in-law Gurpratap Singh and close associate Prateek Kumar are wanted by ED to establish the money trail.The accused are absconding - not joining the investigation - while non-bailable warrants have been issued against them, according to a senior official.Despite CBI and Punjab police having registered multiple FIRs, since as early as 2014, against Bhangoo and his associates, the probe did not achieve much as the ""proceeds of crime"" could not be traced. The initial money trail established by ED revealed the accused had siphoned off the money by depositing them in Kolkata-based shell companies, withdrawing cash and then laundering them to Dubai through hawala dealers to buy hotels and resorts overseas, including Australia.ED began its money laundering probe in 2016 and has filed three prosecution complaints (chargesheets) so far while investigation is still in progress to identify assets of the accused. In 2018, ED had attached two properties of the accused in Australia worth Rs 462 crore. Investors across Delhi, Haryana, Punjab, Maharashtra, Telengana, Karnataka, West Bengal, Rajasthan and Uttarakhand have lost their money to the collective investment, or ponzi scheme.The attached assets once confirmed by the PMLA adjudicating authority are confiscated by ED, and the details of these properties are then shared with Justice Lodha Committee, appointed by the SC for overseeing the process of disposing of properties and to refund the amount to investors, according to a senior ED official.","Pearl Agro Corp Ltd, a multi-level marketing firm, raised more than Rs 60,000 crore and siphoned off most of it into personal assets in India and abroad. ED said it has managed to locate 37 properties of the accused in Ludhiana and Jaipur and attached these. The total attachment in the case has reached Rs 7,600 crore, ED said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127515821,imgsize-579770,width-400,resizemode-4/image-ians.jpg"

“Invitation To Nation Building”: PM Modi Hands Over 61,000 Appointment Letters At 18th Rozgar Mela

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi Sunday described voters as the soul of democracy and called for celebrating the youth, who have come of age, as individuals who hold the power to transform the destiny of the country.School and college campuses can be hubs for movements that ensure every eligible youth is enrolled as a voter, the PM said, emphasising that the National Voters' Day is an ideal occasion for the movement and celebrations every year.Modi's emphasis on the importance of voters in a letter to volunteers of MY-Bharat, a govt-run youth empowerment initiative, appeared to be a pointed counter to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi's ""vote chori"" campaign against his govt and Election Commission.The Prime Minister said that to be a voter is the ""greatest privilege and responsibility in a democracy"". ""The voter is the Bhagya Vidhata of our development journey,"" he said. ""Our first-time voters should be welcomed into democracy as individuals who hold the power to transform the destiny of our country,"" he added.Modi said that he was connecting with them as a fellow citizen who takes great pride in Indian democracy.This year marks the 75th anniversary of the first general election which illustrated the inherent democratic spirit of Indians, he emphasised. That indelible ink on a finger is a badge of honour that ensures democracy remains vibrant and purposeful, Modi added.He said that ""at home and in our residential societies, we can celebrate the same (first-time voters) by sharing sweets. Our schools and colleges have a vital role to play as nurseries of democratic values."" It should be observed joyously like a birthday, the Prime Minister added.""People's commitment to voting is so deep that whether they live high in the Himalayas, in the islands of Andaman and Nicobar, in deserts or in dense forests, they turn up to ensure their voice is heard,""Modi said.He also touched on the issue in his monthly 'Mann ki Baat' broadcast, lauding voters as the soul of democracy.In his letter, Modi said the participation of women, especially young ones, is crucial for an inclusive democracy. The volunteers of the platform - MY-Bharat - belong to a generation that does not wait for things to happen, but actively participates in making things happen with a ""can do"" spirit, he said, asking them to spread awareness about the importance of becoming a voter.The Prime Minister said, ""Let us resolve to make every effort towards strengthening our democracy and creating a developed, inclusive and self-reliant Bharat.""","PM Narendra Modi Sunday described voters as the soul of democracy.

NEW DELHI: IndiGo cancelled Sunday its Tbilisi, Almaty, Tashkent and Baku services till Jan 28 and announced refuelling halts on several flights to the CIS region as rising tensions around Iran are rippling through Indian aviation, forcing flight cancellations, fuel stops and fresh route reviews.As airlines scrambled to keep aircraft out of potentially hostile airspace, IndiGo said on X: ""In view of the recent developments around Iran, we are making certain proactive changes to our flight schedules as part of our continued focus on safety.""Air India is reassessing its transcontinental operations as the situation evolves. The carrier had already stopped overflying Iran on Europe-bound routes after a Jan 16 advisory from the European Union Aviation Safety Agency warned of a heightened risk to civil aviation. ""Given the ongoing situation and the potential for US military action, which has placed Iranian air defence forces on a heightened state of alert, there is currently an increased likelihood of misidentification within Iranian airspace,"" the EASA advisory said.It warned that the possible use of surface-to-air missile systems created ""a high risk to civil flights operating at all altitudes and flight levels,"" urging operators to avoid Iranian airspace entirely. Air India complied on European routes, as the advisory applies to third-country operators authorised by EASA when flying to, from or within EU. Many airlines, including Air India, have instead been routing flights over Iraq. Flights to and from North America are now under review.Air India plans to reassess routing once services resume after a snowstorm disrupted operations along the US east coast.","IndiGo cancels Tbilisi, Almaty, Tashkent and Baku services till Jan 28.

UGC issues new rules to curb caste bias as plaints up 118%,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ugc-issues-new-rules-to-curb-caste-bias-as-plaints-up-118/articleshow/127513368.cms,"Image: IANS

NEW DELHI: A fresh regulatory push aims at making India's campuses safer and more inclusive, with the University Grants Commission (UGC) rolling out a strengthened framework to curb caste-based discrimination across universities and colleges.The move comes as complaints of caste-linked bias have more than doubled over five years - rising 118.4% from 173 in 2019-20 to 378 in 2023-24 - and amid sustained judicial scrutiny over student welfare in institutions.Crucially, the new framework shifts the burden of action squarely onto institutions, making campus leadership directly accountable for preventing discrimination and responding to complaints in a time-bound manner.Notified last week, the UGC (Promotion of Equity in Higher Education Institutions) Regulations, 2026 replace the 2012 rules and significantly widen their scope.For the first time, caste-based discrimination is explicitly defined to cover scheduled castes, scheduled tribes and other backward classes, correcting a key gap in the draft framework. The regulations also broaden the meaning of discrimination to include unfair treatment on grounds of caste, religion, gender, disability and place of birth, and any act that undermines human dignity or equality in educationAt the institutional level, every higher education institution is now required to set up an Equal Opportunity Centre (EOC) to drive inclusion and support disadvantaged students, which will be backed by an Equity Committee headed by the institution chief.These committees must include representation from SCs, STs, OBCs, women and persons with disabilities, and are mandated to meet at least twice a year.EOCs will publish bi-annual reports detailing campus demographics, dropout rates, complaints received and their status, introducing a new layer of transparency.The rules also provide for round-the-clock equity helplines, mobile ""equity squads"" to monitor vulnerable campus spaces, and designated ""equity ambassadors"" across hostels, departments and facilities to flag violations early.Complaints must trigger a committee meeting within 24 hours, with institutions required to act within fixed timelines. Appeals can be taken to an ombudsperson.Crucially, UGC has armed itself with sharper enforcement tools. Institutions that fail to comply with teh regulations can be barred from UGC schemes, stopped from offering degree or online programmes, and in extreme cases removed from the UGC's recognised list - a step that effectively strips an institution of its academic standing.A national-level monitoring committee, with representatives from professional councils and civil society, will oversee implementation and review cases of discrimination at least twice a year.UGC data shows that Equal Opportunity Cells have already received over 1,500 complaints in recent years, even as audits point to uneven resolution and patchy documentation. Supreme Court has repeatedly sought caste-wise data from regulators, underlining the need for credible reporting on the issue.Vice-chancellors say the new framework marks a shift from advisory guidelines to enforceable obligations. Whether it delivers lasting change will depend on transparent data, independent oversight and consistent follow-through - measures that will now decide how far India's campuses move from policy intent to lived equity.",University Grants Commission rolls out strengthened framework to curb caste- based discrimination.

Marco Rubio Talks To Jaishankar On India-US Trade Deal Talks, Congratulates On Enacting Nuclear Bill

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar met a three-member US Congressional delegation along with US ambassador to India Sergio Gor.He later said in a post on X he had a good interaction with the delegation and discussed various aspects of India-US ties, along with the Indo-Pacific and Ukraine conflict.""Congressional interactions have always been an important facet of our relationship,"" said the minister.According to Gor, they had a productive meeting on ways to strengthen US-India partnership for stronger security, expanded trade and cooperation on critical technologies. The meeting came at a time both sides are looking to finally conclude negotiations for a bilateral trade deal that has remained elusive amidst general dissonance in bilateral ties.The delegation comprised two Republican Congressmen, Jimmy Patronis and Mike Rogers, and Democrat Adam Smith. The India-US ties witnessed a major downturn after US President Donald Trump slapped 50% tariff on Indian goods, including a 25% punitive levy over Russian oil purchases. Both sides have held multiple rounds of negotiations last year to firm up the proposed trade deal. However, it could not be sealed yet largely in view of Washington's demands to open up India's farm and dairy sectors.", External affairs minister S Jaishankar met a three-member US Congressional delegation along with US ambassador to India Sergio Gor.

Muslim-led startups filling gaps in India’s economy



NEW DELHI: On most evenings in New York, or Delhi-NCR, Ruha Shadab sits across a laptop screen, explaining professional etiquette to a roomful of Muslim women. Some wear hijabs. Some don’t. What unites them is not appearance. They are learning how to enter professional spaces that were never designed with them in mind. The session is about LinkedIn summaries, interview posture and how to talk about ambition. Many are the first in their families preparing for formal work.Far away in Jharkhand’s Garhwa, Nadim Iqbal Khan scans stock-market data on his phone. He’s checking which listed companies pass a religious test: No alcohol. No gambling. Limited debt. No interest-heavy income (Riba). Mohd Sufyan’s AzanGuru in Delhi beams Quran tutors into iPads — a technology-led learning app for modern learners.And in Mumbai, Nidah Merchant devises “modest” outfits, empowering women to enter public pools or gyms without constant self-surveillance, even as Mohammad Saif Nadeem in Pune manages Qurbani bookings over WhatsApp.None describe what they are building as “political” or as “resistance”.They’re solving ordinary problems — how to work, invest, dress, marry and practise faith in an urban, app-mediated life.Muslim aspiration in India is usually framed through “lack” — less education, fewer jobs, lower incomes. That’s slowly changing. According to Periodic Labour Force Survey, India’s female labour force participation stood at about 31.7% in 2023–24. For Muslim women, it was around 21%, up from about 15% in 2021–22, according to ministry of minority affairs. These numbers shape decisions.When Ruha Shadab returned to India after studying abroad, she often found herself the only Muslim woman in professional rooms. Being Muslim in Saudi Arabia was not a distinguishing feature. Here, it shaped first impressions. The contrast stayed with her. “I realised quickly that I was being read before I was being heard,” she told TOI. She said she sometimes detected a hiring bias.In 2019, while studying at Harvard University, Shadab founded Led By, to help Muslim women transition from education to employment. The programme focuses on women aged 18–30, college students or graduates from lower middle-income households. About 1,200 women have completed Led By’s programmes and over 50,000 have been supported. Many are first-generation professionals. Economic participation also depends on money. For decades, many Indian Muslims kept their distance from stock markets. Interest-based income raised religious doubts. Trading felt uncomfortably close to speculation. Nadim Iqbal Khan, 29, said, “People don’t call me asking how to get rich. They call asking if something is halal.” The questions are about permissibility, not profits.Since Covid-19, volume of queries has multiplied. He explains investing as “shared ownership” in a business, where both profit and loss are borne, making the income permissible within Islamic frameworks. And follows Sharia-compliant screening frameworks used globally. Roughly half of India’s listed companies qualify, he says. Indices such as the Nifty Shariah and BSE Shariah already track them. “Muslims have stayed behind financially because of lack of guidance. That gap can be fixed.”If money has moved into markets, marriage has moved into apps. As families became more nuclear, traditional “rishta networks” thinned. In 2019, Delhi-based entrepreneur Hammad Rahman launched NikahForever, a Muslim matrimony platform designed for marriage, not dating. Users wanted cultural familiarity, privacy and clear intent. Families wanted safeguards. NikahForever built its platform around these expectations. Today, it has over 2 million registered users in India and away.Clothing carries similar negotiations. For Mumbai’s Nidah Merchant, modest fashion was never a statement. It was logistical. Gym wear. Swim wear. Travel clothes. Constant adjustment. When modest fashion gained visibility on social media, Merchant realised this struggle was widely shared. The need, she says, was functional, not ideological. She launched Némah, a modest activewear and swimwear brand for women in 2020 to design clothes suited to Indian conditions.Education completes the picture. During the pandemic, Quran learning moved online but remained fragmented. AzanGuru, founded by Muhammad Sufyan Saif and Mohammed Imran in 2022, sought to digitise Quran learning. The platform has crossed 5 lakh downloads.Taken together, these ventures form an economy shaped less by ideology than by need, filling gaps where the mainstream falls short.","Muslim aspiration in India is usually framed through ‘lack’ — less education, fewer jobs, lower incomes.

The productivity surprise

Opportunity without borders

The rise of outcome culture

Flexibility — With a cost

Visibility creeps back

The boundary problem

The hybrid mode

Work from home, a concept that barely featured in corporate vocabulary before 2020, quickly became the backbone of the global economy when the Covid pandemic brought daily life to a standstill. Offices shut overnight, cities fell silent, but work could not stop. Across industries, companies improvised at speed, building digital systems and remote processes that allowed business to continue without physical workplace gatherings.What began as a crisis response stretched far longer than many expected. For nearly four to five years, remote, then hybrid work defined professional life for millions. Companies discovered they could save on office space, electricity and travel-related expenses. Employees found they could reclaim commuting hours and redesign their workdays. But as organisations now push for a return to offices, some partially and others more aggressively, the big question is resurfacing: if work from home kept businesses running through the worst disruption in decades, why is it now being rolled back?The answer lies in a complex mix of productivity gains, cultural shifts and unintended consequences, as told by multiple corporate workers to TOI.For many employees, the early phase of remote work delivered an unexpected boost.“Without daily commuting and office distractions, I could start work with more energy and focus deeply on tasks,” said Abhishek Gupta, who works at a multinational company. Like many others, he found that removing travel time and office interruptions helped him complete tasks “faster and with better quality than in a traditional office setup”.Across sectors, from technology and finance to consulting and public relations, professionals describe the pandemic years as a period of intense but often highly productive work. Flexible schedules enabled many to craft their schedules based upon meaningful output instead of physical presence.Rachit Jasrotia, a senior project manager with a tech firm, believes the change made the teams more disciplined in the way they worked. Clear documentation, structured digital workflows and asynchronous collaboration became the standard. “Many of the practices introduced during that period — flexible schedules, async collaboration, and an emphasis on clear documentation — have continued and are now part of how we operate by default,” he said.Remote work did more than change how people worked, it changed who got access to work.Kriti, who joined the workforce in the field of finance after the pandemic, says she witnessed how Covid-era remote practices opened up more global collaboration. “Earlier we had limited work since they preferred work to be done by those who were in the US office,” she says. “But due to Covid, a lot of work started being done remotely, which gave Indian teams more opportunities to participate.”Her experience reflects a broader shift many multinational firms saw during the pandemic: location became less of a constraint. Work that was once tied to specific offices began flowing more freely, expanding exposure and responsibility for teams outside traditional headquarters.One of the most significant long-term shifts has been in how productivity is measured. Before the pandemic, time spent in the office often carried implicit weight. Remote work weakened that equation.“Productivity today is judged far more by outcomes — timely delivery, quality of insights, governance rigor, and the impact created,” said Gitanjali, a mid-level employee at a tech-firm. “This is a notable shift from earlier years where visibility or presence carried more weight. My work is data driven hence measured by accuracy, timeliness, and the strategic value delivered, not where I’m sitting. Covid played a key role in normalising this outcome‑focused approach,” she said reflecting on her time as a corporate employee before, during and after the pandemic.Other professionals across industries also said that performance conversations are now more closely tied to impact, quality and timeliness than just hours logged. The pandemic proved that high-quality work could happen without physical proximity, and many organisations adapted their evaluation frameworks accordingly.Even those who entered the workforce after the crisis found these norms already embedded. Meghna, who works in public relations, says flexible work structures and virtual collaboration were presented as standard practice when she began her career. “There is a clear focus on deliverables rather than rigid working hours,” she says. “There’s an understanding that people can be productive without being physically present at all times. ”If remote work brought freedom, it also brought fatigue and mixed feelings on always “being available”Gitanjali talked about how she felt the pressure sometimes to “always be reachable” but found ways to manage. “While I don’t feel explicit pressure to be “always online,” the nature of managing a large and diverse portfolio sometimes creates an implicit expectation to stay reachable across time zones. Stakeholders often operate with tight timelines, so responsiveness is important. I manage this by setting clear expectations, planning communication windows, and keeping governance structures strong so that not everything needs immediate escalation. ”Rachit Jasrotia added that while flexibility improved autonomy and focus, sustainability became a conscious effort. “ Hybrid work gives tremendous flexibility, but without intentional boundaries, work can easily spill into personal time. It requires conscious effort to disconnect, especially when tools and communication channels are always within reach.”Still, few professionals advocate a complete return to pre-pandemic routines. Instead, most are looking for balance - structured flexibility rather than either total remote work or rigid office mandates. Like Kriti who believes work from home has its challenges at times but overall it has made work more “sustainable” following pandemic-era policies at least partly.While many employees say performance is now judged more by outcomes, a quieter shift is underway as offices reopen and hybrid schedules take hold: the importance of being seen is returning, in some workplaces.Flipkart, a major e-commerce firm, announced the end of its work from home policy early last year.Amazon also mandated 5-days of work from the office. Wipro followed suit and tightened work from home rules, has mandated at least six hours in office for three days a week. Similarly, many other firms have tightened or shut-down altogether their work from home policy.Durgesh Kumar Jha, a public relations consultant, spoke on this, “In my experience, productivity at the workplace is increasingly judged by visibility rather than outcomes,” says “Work which is not seen, discussed, or repeatedly reinforced often goes unnoticed.”Meanwhile, in hybrid environments, digital presence has become the new form of visibility. Being active on internal chat platforms, speaking frequently in meetings and responding quickly to messages can shape perceptions of engagement — sometimes as strongly as tangible output.This, employees say, has revived a softer form of presenteeism. It is no longer about sitting late at a desk in the office, but about being continuously visible online.“There is pressure to respond quickly while working from home. I have experienced longer online hours and frequent messages,” said Abhishek, being at mid-management level. However, he remained in favour of the hybrid mode at his workplace adding, “However, once expectations are clarified, this becomes manageable.”That pressure to be seen often translates into pressure to be available.“There is a constant pressure to be available, irrespective of where you work from,” said Durgesh, adding “Availability is often confused with commitment.”Others describe it as less explicit but still persistent. Meghna noted that in client-facing roles, responsiveness is part of the job. “News cycles, client requirements, or urgent developments can sometimes demand quick responses beyond regular hours,” she said. “It’s more role-driven than policy-driven pressure.”Hybrid work has blurred time zones and boundaries, making delayed responses more noticeable. Some professionals say this has made work feel more continuous, even when organisations formally promote flexibility.One theme cuts across roles and industries: blurred boundaries.“Yes, the lines can blur, especially when working from home,” Meghna said. “It’s important to disconnect and protect personal time to avoid burnout,” she added, while referring to conscious efforts to separate the ‘two’ lives.Several professionals say they now rely on deliberate routines which includes- defined work hours, no-meeting windows and stricter notification controls - to prevent work from spilling into personal life.As more companies call employees back to the office, the work-from-home boom may be receding, but it is not disappearing. Instead, a hybrid compromise is emerging. Offices are increasingly seen as spaces for collaboration and relationship-building, while focused individual work often continues remotely.The future of work, professionals argue, will depend less on location and more on clarity.“Work-from culture has created an opportunity to build more inclusive, flexible, and high-impact teams. The key is balancing autonomy with clarity—clear priorities, shared expectations, and trust-based collaboration,” said Rachit.While Abhishek says, “Based on real experience, WFH works. It saves time, reduces stress, and improves focus. With trust, accountability, and clear boundaries, WFH is not just convenient—it is a better way of working for modern corporates.”The culture per-se that began as a necessity has now become a negotiation. Companies are rethinking space and culture. Employees are rethinking boundaries and balance. The next phase of work will probably not be as simple as choosing between home and office, but about defining how both can coexist without sacrificing productivity or well-being.","Remote work became the backbone of the global economy when the Covid pandemic brought daily life to a standstill.

“Invitation To Nation Building”: PM Modi Hands Over 61,000 Appointment Letters At 18th Rozgar Mela

Quotes from PM during Mann Ki Baat

""India one of the fastest growing economies, now time to prioritise quality.""

""Indian products should be synonymous with top quality; let us make excellence our benchmark"".

""The sense of duty that the Constitution expects from every citizen will be fulfilled and also strengthen Bharat's democracy"", the PM said.

India has now become the world’s third largest start-up ecosystem. The journey of StartUp India... the heroes of this remarkable journey are our young colleagues. By stepping out of their comfort zones, the innovations they have brought about are being etched into history. AI, Space, Nuclear Energy, Semiconductors, Mobility, Green Hydrogen, Biotechnology—name any field, and you’ll find an Indian start-up making its mark in it.

""Bhajan clubbing; this is rapidly gaining popularity, especially among Gen Z. It’s heartening to see that the dignity and purity of bhajans are fully upheld in these events. Devotion is not taken lightly. Neither the propriety of words nor the sanctity of emotions is compromised.""

""Our Indian community in Malaysia is doing commendable work...There are more than 500 Tamil schools in Malaysia. Along with the teaching of the Tamil language in these schools, other subjects are also taught in Tamil. In addition, there is a great deal of focus here on other Indian languages, including Telugu and Punjabi.""

""The tradition of Chandanki village in Becharaji, Gujarat, is unique in its own right. If I were to tell you that the people here, especially the elderly, do not cook food in their homes, you would be astonished. The reason for this is the village's splendid community kitchen. In this community kitchen, food for the entire village is prepared together at once, and people sit together to eat. This tradition has been continuing uninterrupted for the past 15 years.

""I’ve come across information about Sheikh Gund village in Anantnag. Challenges related to drugs, tobacco, cigarettes, and alcohol had escalated quite significantly there. Seeing all this, the local Mir Jafar Ji became so distressed that he resolved to address this problem. He united everyone in the village, from the youth to the elderly. The impact of his initiative was such that the shops there stopped selling tobacco products altogether. This effort has also raised awareness among people about the dangers of drugs.""

""I’ve come across information about a similarly unique initiative in Arunachal Pradesh. In Itanagar, a group of young people came together to clean up those areas that needed special attention. These young people made it their mission to clean public spaces in various cities. In Nagaon, Assam, people are emotionally attached to the old lanes there; some individuals there resolved to clean their lanes together. Gradually, more people joined them. In this way, a team was formed that removed a great deal of rubbish from the lanes.""

""In Madhya Pradesh's Panna district, Jagdish Prasad Ahirwar ji... his efforts are also highly commendable. He serves as a beat guard in the forest. During one patrol, he realised that information about many medicinal plants present in the forest was not documented anywhere in an organised manner. Jagdish ji wanted to pass this knowledge on to the next generation, so he began identifying medicinal plants and creating records of them. He identified over one hundred and twenty-five medicinal plants. He gathered details for each plant, including photographs, names, uses, and locations where they are found.""

Here are the key quotes from PM Modi’s Mann Ki Baat address:

“This is the first 'Mann Ki Baat' of the year 2026. Tomorrow, on 26th January, we all will celebrate 'Republic Day'. Our Constitution came into force on this day. This day of 26th January gives us an opportunity to pay homage to the makers of our Constitution.”

“Usually, when someone turns 18 and becomes a voter, it is considered a normal milestone in life. However, this occasion is actually a huge milestone in the life of any Indian.”

“I would like to express my deep appreciation to all those involved in the electoral process in our country, who work at the grassroots level to keep our democracy vibrant.”

“Today, on 'Voter's Day,' I would once again urge my young friends to register themselves as voters upon turning 18.”

“Ten years ago, in January 2016, we embarked on an ambitious journey… Friends, the journey I am talking about is the journey of Start-up India. The heroes of this amazing journey are our young friends. Today India has the third largest ecosystem of start-ups in the world.”

“AI, Space, Nuclear Energy, Semiconductors, Mobility, Green Hydrogen, Biotechnology—you name it, and you'll find an Indian start-up working in that sector.”

“The era of ‘it happens, it works, it will pass’ is over. Let us prioritize quality with all our might this year. Let our mantra be quality, quality, and only quality… Let us make excellence our benchmark.=

“In our country, bhajans and kirtans have been the soul of our culture for centuries. We have heard bhajans in temples, during narrations of kathas, and every era has lived devotion in a way that suited its own times. Today's generation is also achieving remarkable things. Today's youth have incorporated devotion into their experiences and lifestyles. This thinking has given rise to a new cultural trend.

“Young people are gathering in large numbers in various cities across the country. Stages are set, there's lighting, music, and the atmosphere is nothing short of a concert. It feels like a grand concert, but the hymns are sung with complete concentration, dedication, and rhythm, echoing with the hymns. This trend is now being called ""bhajan clubbing,"" and it's becoming increasingly popular, especially among the young.

""It's heartening to see that the dignity and purity of the bhajans are maintained at these events. Devotion is not taken lightly. Neither the decorum of words nor the sentiment is compromised. The stage may be modern, the musical presentation may be different, but the core spirit remains the same. A constant flow of spirituality is felt there.""

“My dear countrymen, today our culture and festivals are making their mark across the world. Indian festivals are celebrated with great enthusiasm and joy in every corner of the world. Our Indian brothers and sisters have played a vital role in maintaining all kinds of cultural vibrancy. Wherever they are, they are preserving and promoting the essence of their culture.”

Why this cohort is growing

What do they build?

Unfair advantages

.

Back to build

In the Indian startup ecosystem, one constantly hears about how IITs and BITS produce some incredible founders. But there is a large cohort of founders that doesn’t get as much airtime despite quietly outperforming any single IIT when it comes to unicorn creation. Meet the BARBIE founders — those who did their Bachelors Abroad and Returned to Build in the Indian Ecosystem. The term, coined by Sajith Pai, a Partner at Blume Ventures, has gained traction as a shorthand for this distinct founder archetype.From Lenskart co-founder Peyush Bansal to Zepto’s Aadit Palicha, these founders have moved back to India to build audacious, ambitious and enduring businesses in the country. The numbers speak for themselves — of the roughly 300 BARBIE founders we identified, 3.7% have gone on to build unicorns, a rate higher than IIT Delhi (2.7%) and IIT Bombay (2%). BARBIE founders have started 11.5% of all active unicorns in the country.In 2024, there were 70,000 Indian students studying for undergraduate degrees in the US and UK according to Open Doors and HESA, compared to 20,000 students a decade ago.While this is a tiny minority of the overall Indian undergrad population of 33m students, this number has been growing fast due to rising income levels in India and a myriad of problems with the Indian college experience. Importantly, many of these students are now returning to build in India. Though there is no reliable data on this reverse brain drain, anecdotal evidence suggests that return rates among Indian undergrads are on par with, or slightly higher than, earlier cohorts, likely influenced by recent geopolitical concerns.BARBIEs overwhelmingly build companies targeted at consumers rather than enterprises. Consumer brands account for 37% of all BARBIE-founded companies, followed by marketplaces, fintech, gaming, and other consumer internet businesses.There are two key reasons for this. First is taste and global exposure. These founders usually go to colleges in the US (78%) and UK (16%) that happen to be a melting pot of cultures. New consumer trends naturally emerge from these cultural hotspots and founders are then able to bring this novel flavour of products with a local twist back to India.The typical BARBIE founder spends three to four years doing an undergrad degree, followed by a couple of years working in tech, consulting, or banking before eventually moving back to India. A lot of these founders start up soon after moving back, but a fair number also spend some time working in the ecosystem or their family businesses before venturing out on their own.We tracked the undergraduate alma maters of BARBIE founders. Penn ranks first, followed by Stanford, Michigan, and USC. Penn’s lead is unsurprising given Wharton’s presence and its role as an early cradle of US D2C. In India, the Penn diaspora has gone on to build brands such as Knya, Taali Foods, and The Pant Project.Knya founder Abhijeet Kaji says, “What my time at Penn and Stanford really changed was my relationship with time and ambition. I saw founders and operators who were not in a hurry to 'win' a year, but very intentional about building something that would matter in ten or twenty years. That long-term orientation changes the kinds of decisions you make…and how much you are willing to invest before the outcomes are visible. ”There is also a greater focus and appreciation on design language in many of these brands. Founders often come from fashion, design, or creative backgrounds — enabling them to build brands that feel globally fluent but are distinctively India-first.Second is leverage. Many founders come from families that run businesses in the same or adjacent sectors. Trying to build a new consumer brand is hard in India because of low entry barriers and intense competition. These founders have an unfair advantage as they can leverage their family businesses on either the supply (e.g. a textile manufacturing family business enabling a D2C brand) or demand side (e.g. a family-owned retail chain or distributor becoming the first large buyer).Let’s also address the elephant in the room — privilege. An undergrad degree in the US or UK can cost up to Rs 2.5 crore for a four-year programme, so it is only affluent families who can afford to send their children abroad. That affluence (and the safety net of family businesses in many cases) often influences their decision to come back and take the risk of entrepreneurship. They’re also bolder in challenging the status quo and often end up creating new markets.Aadit Palicha and Kaivalya Vohra showed consumers that you can build an ecommerce marketplace from scratch and deliver products to millions of customers within 10 minutes. Anjali Sardana of Pronto is transforming home services by organising a fragmented workforce with professional standards. Pratham Mittal, founder of Masters’ Union and Tetr, is building a completely new kind of educational institution, focused on learning by doing instead of just sitting in classrooms.BARBIE founders also tend to excel at fundraising. As colleges abroad encourage a healthy dose of interdisciplinary liberal arts classes with all the critical reading and writing training that goes with it, they are able to articulate their startup vision with clarity. In the early days of a startup, when you have nothing but a story, the most creative storytellers are the ones that succeed.However, it isn’t all rosy. They have no access to the IIT / BITS networks that are omnipresent in the Indian startup ecosystem. And coming from predominantly English-speaking privileged backgrounds sometimes works against them as they might have real blind spots about how the long tail of India lives and consumes. This is why you might not see a Kuku FM or Meesho being founded by a BARBIE founder. Finally, some investors are biased against this cohort, viewing them as less hungry because they come from privilege — which can be a fair critique in some cases.While global immigration is facing significant headwinds, Indian students still aspire to study abroad. However, the political environment in these countries discourages them from staying on after they graduate. This dynamic suggests that the number and significance of BARBIE founders will only increase significantly in the coming years.","In 2024, there were 70,000 Indian students studying for undergraduate degrees in the US and UK.

A Challenging Economic Backdrop

Deloitte Partner Says Budget Must Fix GST Gaps, Cut Costs, Boost Domestic Manufacturing

Limited Room for Tax Relief

Capital Gains and Market Participation

The Next Phase of

Tax Simplification

Administrative Reforms

Take away

(Kuldip Kumar is Partner, Mainstay Tax Advisors LLP)

As the Union Budget approaches, expectations of major tax giveaways appear muted. However, this Budget may assume significance not for dramatic announcements, but for how the Government balances growth, fiscal discipline, and reform amid a challenging economic environment.The Honourable Finance Minister faces a complex macroeconomic environment. Factors such as a weakening rupee, pressure on exports, the absence of a comprehensive US trade agreement, geopolitical tensions, and continued foreign institutional investor outflows are likely to influence policy decisions. Measures announced in this year’s Budget are therefore expected to align closely with the Government’s broader economic and reform framework.Accordingly, incentivising businesses particularly export-oriented sectors and accelerating employment generation are likely to receive focused attention in this Budget.Last year’s Budget delivered meaningful tax relief through revisions in personal income-tax slabs and enhancement of the Section 87A rebate, leaving limited headroom for further concessions.These changes were introduced under the new tax regime, while the old tax regime was left unchanged.This approach was intended to encourage taxpayers still following the old regime to transition to the simpler new tax system.For FY 2023–24, nearly 72% of taxpayers opted for the new tax regime, and this proportion is expected to increase further in the current year.Does this mean the old tax regime could be phased out entirely? Perhaps not immediately, especially since the new tax regime has also been incorporated into the Income Tax Act, 2025.However, given the continued instances of misuse and claims of incorrect deductions under the old regime, it would not be surprising if the Government eventually considers doing away with it altogether.In the 2024 Budget, the Government made significant changes to the capital gains tax regime, including revisions to holding periods and tax rates, with the objective of simplification. While some asset classes benefited, tax rates on listed securities both short-term and long-term and the Securities Transaction Tax (STT), were increased.Given the growing participation of retail investors in Indian capital markets, there is a case for reviewing these measures. While challenging from a revenue perspective, the Government could consider moderating capital gains tax rates on listed securities or enhancing the basic exemption limit for long-term capital gains, currently set at ₹1.25 lakh. Further, permitting set-off of long-term capital losses against short-term capital gains in Budget 2026 would improve tax equity and align treatment of capital assets.Fiscal Discipline Remains an Important ConsiderationThe Government is expected to adhere firmly to its fiscal consolidation path, leaving limited scope for aggressive fiscal expansion. That said, carefully calibrated policy measures particularly those aimed at stimulating consumption and job creation could strengthen growth momentum and improve tax buoyancy. As with most fiscal initiatives, the benefits of such measures are likely to become visible only after a time lag.Tax simplification remains an ongoing journey. While significant progress has been achieved through digitisation and pre-filled data, several pain points persist:Clubbing provisions continue to complicate joint ownership of assets between spouses, despite the sound financial logic behind such arrangements. Introducing an option for joint tax filing, as practiced in countries like the United States, could significantly ease compliance.Notional taxation on vacant properties is often perceived as inequitable and warrants reconsideration.TDS and TCS mechanisms, though effective for tracking transactions, frequently result in excessive deductions and cash-flow strain for taxpayers, especially where final tax liability is substantially lower.Pre-filled tax returns could be further expanded, particularly for salaried taxpayers without business income, reducing manual intervention and errors.Despite the delegation of appellate powers to Joint Commissioners, a substantial backlog of tax appeals continues to persist. Introducing clearly defined timelines and enhancing accountability would help restore taxpayer confidence.Similarly, the practice of adjusting refunds against disputed demands often for several years requires urgent reform.Refunds granted in favour of taxpayers should be released automatically, without the need for repeated follow-ups or grievances.Trust as the Cornerstone of ComplianceRecent initiatives where tax authorities proactively alert taxpayers to potential mismatches mark a positive shift towards a trust-based compliance framework. The Government has already introduced the Taxpayers’ Charter; effective enforcement of its principles on the ground would benefit both sides in improving compliance for the Government while offering peace of mind to the taxpayers.While Budget 2026 may not be about headline-grabbing tax cuts, it is likely to outline how the Government intends to navigate uncertainty, sustain growth, reinforce fiscal discipline, and deepen structural reforms.In that sense, this Budget may prove to be less about immediate relief and more about building long-term economic resilience.","The Honourable Finance Minister faces a complex macroeconomic environment.

India, China & The World Move Away From US Treasuries

India’s Treasuries Holdings Drop as Gold Reserves Increase

Why Dependence on Dollar-denominated Assets Is Being Reduced

USD INR Rates & Dollar Index

In a big shift for one of the top five largest economies, India’s holdings of US Treasuries have seen a drop, sliding to the lowest level in five years. The reason for the fall is both need based and strategic: rupee has been depreciating, making it one of the worst performing Asian countries last year. The second reason is to strategically change the composition of foreign exchange reserves, reducing dependence on US assets. In fact, most economies around the world are reducing reliance on the world’s largest bond market.US government data released last week shows that India’s holdings of long-term American debt have fallen to about $174 billion. This marks a drastic 26% drop from the peak which was recorded in 2023. According to the Reserve Bank of India , Treasuries now make up roughly one-third of the country’s forex reserves, down from around 40% a year ago.With gold and other assets accounting for a growing share of reserves, India’s strategy echoes steps taken by bigger holders such as China, according to a Bloomberg report.This has reignited debate over US financial dominance and the status of its debt as a preferred reserve instrument. Fresh trade threats by US President Donald Trump related to Greenland have added to global uncertainty, fuelling speculation that European nations could also pare back their exposure to US Treasuries.Win Thin, chief economist at Bank of Nassau 1982 Ltd., said the trend likely reflects an effort to cut dependence on dollar-denominated assets to reduce sanction-related risks. “There is still room for India to lighten up its Treasuries holdings,” he said.In September, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said the RBI was making a “very considered decision” to diversify the country’s reserves.For India and other countries, these lessons have been shaped by the US decision to freeze Russia’s foreign exchange reserves after its war with Ukraine which started in February 2022. India’s decision to continue importing Russian oil has subsequently become a flashpoint with US President Donald Trump. It’s even led to 25% additional penal tariffs being imposed.“The speed at which relations between the US and India deteriorated last year would have taken many by surprise and jolted policymakers to reduce their vulnerabilities,” said Shilan Shah of Capital Economics, who topped Bloomberg’s rupee forecasting rankings last quarter.Yet another factor influencing the shift is the Reserve Bank of India’s effort to shore up the rupee, which has slipped to record lows amid delays in finalising a US-India trade agreement following the Trump administration’s move to impose 50% tariffs on Indian exports, a tariff rate which is the highest in Asia. By cutting back on US Treasury holdings, the central bank can deploy those funds to buy rupees and support the currency.Also read: Trump tariffs, falling rupee: What are the biggest risks to India’s growth story

In financial markets, President Trump’s trade tariffs and the increasing use of the dollar as a sanctions tool have prompted renewed debate over the safety of US Treasuries as a reserve asset, with recent action against Venezuela also reinforcing those concerns.While the RBI is not among the largest holders of US government debt, with its exposure at about a quarter of China’s nearly $683 billion holdings and Japan’s $1.2 trillion portfolio as of November, overseas ownership of Treasuries remains close to record highs. Even so, India’s selling has added fresh momentum to discussions about the place of US sovereign bonds in global investment portfolios.According to the Bloomberg report, central banks around the world are increasingly grappling with a more complicated policy environment that is putting added strain on how reserves are allocated. Although the US dollar and Treasuries continue to dominate as global reserve assets, momentum is clearly building toward diversifying into other options.Against this backdrop, the Reserve Bank of India’s reduction in Treasury holdings has come at the same time as a step in gold purchases. In fact, India currently holds the world’s 7th largest gold reserves. Other countries are making similar moves. China and Brazil have lowered their long-term Treasury holdings in October to the weakest levels seen since at least 2011, with China simultaneously stepping up gold purchases.The shift toward gold has gathered pace elsewhere as well. Earlier this week, the National Bank of Poland, currently the world’s largest reported buyer of gold, cleared plans to add another 150 tonnes of the metal to its reserves.There are factors that could slow India’s pace of selling, including a more stable rupee that reduces the need for currency intervention, or an easing of geopolitical stress if the delayed trade agreement is eventually concluded. “If the trade deal materializes, the need for aggressive currency defense could diminish,” said Krishna Bhimavarapu, Asia Pacific economist at State Street Investment Management.Even so, many analysts believe the broader reallocation toward alternative assets is likely to persist. A survey conducted in November by think tank OMFIF showed that while most central banks still hold the dollar, nearly 60% intend to explore substitutes over the next one to two years.“The trend is very much embedded at this point,” Michael Brown, senior research strategist at Pepperstone in London, said of India’s Treasury sales, adding that a trade agreement “will simply see holdings stabilize, rather than India go on some sort of mass buying spree.”","India’s holdings of US Treasuries have seen a drop, sliding to the lowest level in five years.

Blue Davos 2026: What it means and why 2026 is being called the ‘Year of Water’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/blue-davos-2026-what-it-means-and-why-2026-is-being-called-the-year-of-water/articleshow/126787725.cms,"AI-generated

What is Blue Davos and why water dominates the Davos 2026 agenda

Extreme water events are becoming more common

Long term data show rising pressure on freshwater

Flood exposure is growing alongside scarcity

Oceans are warming faster than expected

Economic stakes are drawing new attention

New approaches are beginning to surface





A theme known as ""Blue Davos"" is beginning to emerge at the World Economic Forum 's annual meeting, signifying that water-related issues are no longer marginalised in international discourse. The connections between rivers, oceans, glaciers, and groundwater as a one stressed system are receiving more attention. The food supply, commercial routes, public health, and economic stability are all under pressure, frequently simultaneously. In 2026, the UAE will host just the third UN Water Conference in nearly 50 years, raising hopes that long-standing issues may finally find political attention and financial support. The tone is more about acknowledging boundaries that are become increasingly difficult to ignore than it is about declaring crises.At Davos, water is no longer framed as a narrow development issue or a footnote to climate policy. Under the Blue Davos label, it is being treated as a core condition for economic resilience and political stability. Briefings point to disruptions across the water cycle that are appearing more often and lasting longer. Flooding, drought and pollution are touching supply chains, energy systems and cities in uneven ways.Bringing oceans and freshwater into the same discussion reflects a broader scientific view that changes in one part of the system tend to echo elsewhere, sometimes far from where they begin.Recent events have made the pattern harder to ignore. In late 2024, rivers in parts of the Amazon basin dropped to unusually low levels, while Spain dealt with its most serious flooding in decades. Similar contrasts appeared in other regions, occasionally within the same country. Water arrives suddenly and destructively in some places, while it retreats for months in others. Researchers often describe this less as a series of isolated shocks and more as a hydrological cycle that is drifting out of balance, shaped by accumulated stress rather than a single breaking point.Longer records reinforce that impression. Since 1900, the share of global land affected by dry conditions has more than doubled, according to OECD data. This expansion strains drinking water supplies and agriculture at the same time. Large lakes offer another signal. Around half of the world’s biggest lakes no longer recover easily after periods of stress. River basins show similar instability, swinging between unusually high and low flows instead of staying within familiar seasonal ranges.Flood risk has increased alongside water shortage. World Bank estimates suggest roughly 1.8 billion people face exposure to significant flooding during a one-in-100-year event, most of them in low and middle-income countries. Even shallow flooding can interrupt housing, transportation, and daily work. These impacts are often felt most severely in areas where sanitation and access to safe drinking water are already unreliable. What emerges is not a single global picture but a patchwork shaped by income, geography and infrastructure.The ocean side of the cycle is shifting as well. Ocean warming has accelerated sharply since the 1980s, bringing effects that include ice loss, rising seas and acidification. Glaciers are losing hundreds of gigatonnes of ice each year. These changes influence weather patterns and coastal economies, sometimes far inland. The scale of these links helps explain why Blue Davos treats marine and freshwater issues as parts of the same problem rather than separate tracks.Water also carries economic weight that is becoming harder to overlook. Estimates place the annual value of water ecosystems at around 58 trillion dollars. Investment, however, has not kept pace. Only a small share of global water funding comes from private sources, leaving gaps in infrastructure and resilience. Projections suggest that close to a third of global GDP could be exposed to high water stress by mid century. These figures are nudging the conversation toward risk and long term stability rather than short term fixes.Some responses are beginning to appear. Water-focused microfinance schemes have helped millions gain access to safe taps and sanitation. Industry groups are testing cooperation at the river basin level, while ocean-related innovation is attracting more investors than in the past. Funding linked to the blue economy has grown quickly over the last decade, driven partly by recognition that degradation carries financial risk. These efforts do not resolve the wider imbalance. They sit alongside uncertainty and long timelines, as attention slowly builds toward 2026.","Water is no longer framed as a narrow development issue or a footnote to climate policy.

BENGALURU: Eight people from Karnataka figure in the Padma award list announced Sunday - a list that spans classical scholarship, grassroots social work, laboratory science, medicine, education, and industry. The one Padma Bhushan and seven Padma Shri awards recognise careers built quietly over decades, rooted in institutions, neighbourhoods and traditions.A Sanskrit scholar, polyglot and among the country's foremost exponents of Avadhana - an ancient Indian literary and cognitive performance art - R Ganesh, 63, has spent decades sustaining a discipline that tests memory, concentration and poetic imagination at once. In Avadhana, multiple scholars pose questions simultaneously, to which the Avadhani responds by composing poetry extempore, while strictly adhering to rules of metre, language and theme.Born in 1962 in Kolar, Ganesh's academic journey spans diverse disciplines. He holds a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering, a master's degree in metallurgy from the Indian Institute of Science, a master's degree in Sanskrit, and a doctor of literature in Kannada from Hampi University, where his research focused on avadhana theory and practice.Fluent in Kannada, Sanskrit, Telugu, Tamil and Prakrit, Ganesh has performed over 1,300 Avadhanas, including the demanding Shatavadhana with a hundred participants.A prolific author and speaker, he continues to interpret classical literary traditions for contemporary audiences.At 71, Shubha V Iyengar's Padma Shri honours a career that mirrors India's post-independence scientific journey. A former scientist at CSIR-National Aerospace Laboratories, she joined NAL in 1974 after securing first rank in both her BSc (honours) in physics and MSc degrees from Central College.""My interest in science came from my father. He believed women should pursue higher studies and wanted me to complete my PhD. I lost him while I was an MSc student, but I carried his wish forward,"" she told TOI. The youngest of nine siblings - several of whom have passed away - Shubha says her family remains her backbone.Her career includes several landmark contributions, most notably Drishti, a system now deployed at Indian airports, and by the Indian Air Force, significantly strengthening aviation safety and operations. Calling the award recognition ""for everything put together - science, engineering and service to the nation"", Iyengar continues to stay professionally active after retirement.Fondly known as 'Amma', SG Susheelamma, 86, founded Sumangali Seva Ashrama in 1975 to support destitute women, orphaned children and economically weaker communities. Located in Cholanayakanahalli near Hebbal, the ashrama today houses about 110 residents, including 70 children and 40 elderly people.Over five decades, Susheelamma estimates her work has touched more than 30 lakh lives through initiatives in housing for slum dwellers, education, healthcare and employment. The ashrama runs adult literacy programmes, vocational training for women and regular health camps. She also founded the Basavananda Higher Primary School, which provides free education to around 250 students.Currently working on the holistic development of tribal communities in Magadi and Bandipur, she has launched initiatives to provide autorickshaws and training to tribal women to help them earn a livelihood. The Padma Shri, she says, has only strengthened her resolve to continue.Vempati is a technocrat and strategic advisor with two decades of experience across technology, media and public policy. He advises organisations and govt institutions, and is involved in shaping India's AI ecosystem.A co-founder of the DeepTech for Bharat Foundation, he leads the AI4India initiative and serves on the board of IIT Bombay-incubated BharatGen Technology Foundation, focused on India's sovereign AI capabilities. He also chairs the Apex Advisory Committee for Science and Technology Communication at the Department of Science and Technology and heads UGC committee on educational media.Vempati has held governance and advisory roles across broadcasting and academia, including the Broadcast Audience Research Council.

BENGALURU: The Congress govt has decided to grant Rs 255 crore worth of land in Bengaluru to 22 Dalit and OBC mutts, overruling red flags raised by key departments on giving away gomala land and parcels that are within the city corporation limits.Documents reviewed by TOI show that the departments of finance, and law and parliamentary affairs advised against the decision as it might attract legal scrutiny since gomala land could not be alienated or granted to private organisations.However, senior ministers said such opinions are ""nothing new"" and are almost similar for all land-grant requests. The govt made the decision last week.In early 2025, seers from Dalit and Backward Classes had sought land and assistance from the govt to run their philanthropic institutions in Bengaluru. As part of the appeal, the president and general secretary of the Backward Dalit Mathadeeshwarara Okkuta, Bengaluru, had sought land for 22 of their mutts in Ravuttanahalli, Dasanapura of Bangalore North district.Some 34 acres and 9 guntas on Survey No. 57 and another parcel of 18 acres and 5 guntas on Survey No. 58 were given to these institutions. Each mutt was proposed to get between 20 guntas and four acres, depending on the size of the mutt, its followers and extend of social work.""Supreme Court has directed chief secretaries of all the states and Union territories to preserve poramboku/gomala/kharabu/waterbodies for public use as per cases of Jagpal Singh and others vs State of Punjab report in 2011 and Joginder and others vs State of Haryana special leave petition and Hinch Lal Tiwari vs Kamal Devi and others on July 25 2001,"" reads a note by the state govt departments. It further says land proposed to be given falls within 18km from erstwhile BBMP headquarters.As per Karnataka Land Grant Rules-1969, govt land within the city limits shall not be granted to any individual or private institutions and shall be reserved for public purpose. “Therefore, there is no provision for granting the land,” concluded the departments.According to the finance department, the land value, as per guidance value, was Rs 1 crore an acre, while the same land, if converted but undeveloped, was worth Rs 1.8 crore. If developed, the land would be worth Rs 4.8 crore an acre. Revenue officials claimed some of these mutts who have been granted land were of recent origin and had no track record to substantiate their philanthropic work.",The Congress govt has decided to grant Rs 255 crore worth of land in Bengaluru to 22 Dalit and OBC mutts. The decision overruled red flags raised by key departments on giving away gomala land and parcels that are within the city corporation limits.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127514543,imgsize-1092324,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/karnataka-grants-bengaluru-land-worth-rs-255-crore-to-22-dalit-amp-obc-mutts.jpg"

BENGALURU: Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla, India's second astronaut and the first from the country to have stayed aboard the International Space Station (ISS), has termed the Ashok Chakra - India's highest peacetime military decoration - as a collective blessing from the people of India.After the formal announcement on Sunday, Shux, as he is fondly known among colleagues, told TOI: ""I feel immensely proud and deeply grateful for the honour conferred upon me. When I embarked on this journey [as an astronaut], I did so as a representative of every Indian. Today, as I receive this recognition, I experience it as a collective blessing from the people of India. I am truly humbled by this award.""At the same time, he said, the honour brought with it a renewed and heightened sense of responsibility. ""...My journey must translate into meaningful and tangible outcomes, particularly in advancing our future human space missions. I remain firmly committed to ensuring that the opportunity I was given-to journey into space from Bharat-opens the door for many more such opportunities in the years ahead.""He extended his gratitude for the goodwill and support he has received, and said: ""...I express my heartfelt gratitude to the Government of India for bestowing this prestigious honour upon me.""Wing Commander (retd) Rakesh Sharma, India's first astronaut to have travelled to space (April 1984) had also received an Ashok Chakra for his mission with the Soviets. Isro chairman V Narayanan told TOI, on Sunday: ""I am proud that my colleague is getting this award and I thank the govt and the PM for it. This recognition is important not only to Shukla but also for India's human space programme, which will see many more astronauts in the coming years, in line with the govt's vision."" Shux was aboard the ISS in mid-2025, the year that marked 25 years of continuous human presence on the multinational platform in space. In his first full-fledged exclusive interview in Nov 2025, when ISS achieved this milestone, he had told TOI the space station showed what can happen when long-term engineering goals align with cooperation.""...During my mission, we had 11 crew members from six countries working on more than 60 experiments. We also spoke to students worldwide. Those 20 days showed how a platform built with 1990s technology still supports new science and joint work. ISS stands for continuity, shared goals, and a way of working that keeps people focused on the task, not the boundaries on Earth,"" Shux had said.","Shubhanshu Shukla, India's second astronaut and the first from the country to have stayed aboard the International Space Station (ISS), has termed the Ashok Chakra as a collective blessing from the people of India.

America's push for rare earths

The US government is set to acquire a 10% stake in Oklahoma-based USA Rare Earth, as part of Trump administration's $1.6 billion investment. The package is aimed towards supporting the firm to develop a local mine and magnet production facility, according to two sources familiar with the deal.In addition to this government-backed investment, USA Rare Earth is also securing a separate $1 billion private funding round, which, along with the public announcement, is expected on Monday, Reuters reported. The company will also host a morning conference call with investors to discuss the terms.Rare earth minerals, a group of 17 elements critical for electronics and military equipment, are largely processed by China. The output from United States, however, remains limited, prompting Washington to make efforts to expand domestic production.Under the investment terms, the US government will receive 16.1 million shares in USA Rare Earth, along with warrants for an additional 17.6 million shares. Both are priced at $17.17 per share, close to the company’s trading level earlier this month.For fundraising support, USA Rare Earth has enlisted Cantor Fitzgerald, chaired by Brandon Lutnick, the son of US secretary of commerce Howard Lutnick, a source was quoted as saying by Reuters.At present, USA Rare Earth is developing a mine in Sierra Blanca, Texas, in collaboration with Texas Mineral Resources, expected to begin operations by 2028. Its magnet manufacturing facility in Stillwater, Oklahoma, is scheduled to start later this year.This latest investment follows previous equity stakes taken by the Trump administration in MP Materials , Lithium Americas , and Trilogy Metals. A senior Trump official told Reuters last month that more “historic deals” with the US mining sector are planned to increase production of lithium, rare earths, and other critical minerals vital to national defence, artificial intelligence, and related industries.","The US government is set to acquire a 10% stake in Oklahoma-based USA Rare Earth, as part of Trump administration's $1.6 billion investment.

NEW DELHI: Received an SMS informing you of a pending traffic challan with a link to pay online? Check it before you click. Cybercriminals are increasingly using fake challan alerts to defraud people. Recently, an elderly resident in east Delhi was defrauded of Rs 2.5 lakh after he clicked on such a fraudulent link to pay a small fine of Rs 500.The victim, a 65-year-old from Laxmi Nagar, told police that his wife had received a message on Jan 13 from an unknown mobile number containing a link for paying a vehicle challan. Believing it to be genuine, she forwarded it to her husband.When he tried to pay using his credit card, the transaction initially appeared to go through normally. But within minutes, another Rs 2,49,246.61 was billed on his card, including SAR 10,350 in Saudi riyals, suggesting international routing. A case has been registered by the cyber police of East district for cheating and personation.Police warn that such frauds are on the rise, exploiting people's fear of fines and legal action. With WhatsApp-based challan alerts now active, scammers send messages on SMS, WhatsApp, even through PDFs.Some claim to be from the transport ministry or pose as transport officials. These messages often pressure recipients to ""process"" the payment immediately via a link that mimics official portals.Such links, QR codes or payment requests from unknown numbers or unverified WhatsApp accounts are a major warning sign as are urgent messages warning of fines, licence suspension or legal action, officers caution. Fraudsters may also ask for payment through third-party apps, agents or unfamiliar websites. They often omit critical details such as notice number, vehicle number and offence location. The messages may try to collect sensitive information through links instead of redirecting to the official Parivahan portal. Once clicked, these links lead to fake gateways designed to steal banking credentials and withdraw funds without authorisation.To protect yourself, pay challans only through official channels. Always verify website URLs before entering any details and check challans using your vehicle or licence number. Authorities also emphasise the importance of the ""golden hour"", the first 60 minutes after a fraud, during which swift reporting can increase the chances of blocking or recovering stolen money.Victims should immediately call the National Cyber Crime helpline 1930, lodge a complaint on cybercrime.gov.in and inform their bank or card issuer to block the account and initiate a chargeback.","Police warn that such frauds are on the rise, exploiting people's fear of fines and legal action.

Merge Labs vs Neuralink





ChatGPT-maker OpenAI has announced an investment in Merge Labs, a brain-computer interface (BCI) startup which was founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. Rival to Elon Musk ’s Neuralink, the mission of Merge Labs is to develop safe and scaleable brain-computer interfaces. “We are excited to support and collaborate with Merge Labs as they turn an ambitious idea into reality and ultimately products that are useful for people,” said the company.OpenAI revealed that funding made by the company will support Merge Labs’ mission of creating safe, scalable brain-computer interfaces that could one day allow humans to interact with artificial intelligence directly through neural signals. The company has not yet disclosed the size of the investment, but the partnership underscores OpenAI’s growing interest in technologies that extend beyond software into hardware and human augmentation.Merge Labs is a research lab with the long-term mission of bridging biological and artificial intelligence to maximize human ability, agency, and experience. It is developing fundamentally new approaches⁠ (opens in a new window) to BCIs that are safe and interface with the brain at much higher bandwidth by combining biology, devices, and AI.The company is focused on creating non-invasive neural interfaces that can translate brain activity into digital commands. Unlike more invasive approaches that require surgical implants, Merge Labs aims to build consumer-ready devices that are both accessible and ethically designed.The company’s early prototypes reportedly use advanced sensors and machine learning models to interpret neural signals, with potential applications ranging from medical rehabilitation to enhanced productivity tools.Elon Musk founded Neuralink in 2016 and till now the company has made significant progress in developing brain implants which enable people with paralysis to control devices with the help of their thoughts. The Elon Musk-owned company recently raised $600 million at a $9 billion valuation and is conducting human trials.Merge Labs on the other hand, is reportedly working on less invasive brain interfaces with a strong emphasis on AI-powered enhancements. The focus of the startup is not just medical rehabilitation but broader human-AI integration.“I believe the merge has already started,” Altman wrote in a 2017 blog post. “We will be the first species ever to design our own descendants”.","Merge Labs is a brain-computer interface (BCI) startup founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.

Satya Nadella says competition is 'keeping us fit'

CEO Satya Nadella says Microsoft avoiding the 'Zero-Sum' trap





During a wide-ranging discussion at the World Economic Forum 2026, Nadella said that while the competition with fellow tech giants like Google, Meta and other is fiercer than ever, the expanding role of technology in the global economy makes this a “blessed” time for the industry. His comments came amid a “pretty intense” era led by artificial intelligence (AI) and shifting global markets.“It's a pretty intense time. I mean, so the way I always think is, it's always helpful. When you have a complete new set of competitors every decade, because that keeps you fit,” Nadella said. Reflecting on his 34-year journey at Microsoft, Nadella dismissed the idea that the AI race is a zero-sum game, instead pointing to a future where tech’s share of the world's GDP will only continue to rise.Nadella highlighted that Microsoft’s longevity is rooted in its ability to adapt to new “existential” rivals every decade. He recalled joining the company in 1992 when the primary threat was Novell, further noting that the competition has now changed with its AI rivals“If you think about it, I joined Microsoft in 92 when I had Novell as the big existential competitor. Here we are in 2026, it's a pretty intense time. I'm glad there's the competition.It's, quite honestly, at the end of the day, when I look at it right as a percentage of GDP five years from now, where will Tech be right? It will be higher, so we're blessed to be in this industry,” the Microsoft CEO added.While there is a narrative that there’s a winner-takes-all scenario, Nadella insisted that the Total Addressable Market (TAM) tells a different story.“It's a lot of intense competition, but it's not so zero-sum, as some people make it out.
