Diplomatic ties between the two countries were first established in 1957.During the visit, PM Modi will hold bilateral talks with Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. India is also exploring opportunities for defence collaboration, including the sale of Dornier aircraft and maintenance of Scorpene submarines and SU-30 aircraft, according to the ministry of external affairs.The prime mnister will engage with members of the Indian diaspora and business representatives in Malaysia, which is home to a 2.9 million-strong Indian community, the third-largest in the world and the second-largest PIO community, numbering 2.75 million.Malaysia is a key partner for India in ASEAN and the Indo-Pacific region and a central pillar of India’s Act East Policy. The Torana Gate in Kuala Lumpur, inaugurated by PM Modi and then Malaysian PM Najib Razak in 2015, symbolizes the enduring friendship between the two nations.PM Modi had previously met Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim on the sidelines of the BRICS Summit in Rio de Janeiro on July 6, 2025, participated virtually in the 22nd ASEAN-India Summit in Kuala Lumpur on October 26, and spoke with him over a phone call on October 22.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi leaves for two-day visit to Malaysia.

IFS/IAS appointees can’t reappear for 2026 Civil Services exam; IPS can’t choose IPS again,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ifs/ias-appointees-cant-reappear-for-2026-civil-services-exam-ips-cant-choose-ips-again/articleshow/128019955.cms,".

NEW DELHI: In a move aimed at regulating repeated attempts at Civil Services Examination (CSE) by candidates selected for IAS , Indian Foreign Service (IFS) or IPS, the updated rules for the elite recruitment exam bar candidates already appointed to IAS or IFS, from appearing in CSE 2026.Even if such an appointment happens after 'prelims' 2026, the candidate will not be allowed to write the 'mains' exam or be considered for service from CSE-2026, as per the CSE 2026 rules notified on Wednesday.A candidate already appointed to IPS from an earlier CSE can apply for and appear in CSE-2026, but cannot relist IPS as his service preference. If a candidate is allocated IPS or any Group ‘A’ central service through CSE-2026, they will be allowed one improvement attempt in CSE-2027 by using a one-time training exemption. If a candidate selected through CSE-2026 neither joins training nor avails of exemption, his 2026 service allocation shall stand cancelled.Where a candidate selected through CSE-2026 reappears in CSE 2027 and obtains a better service, he must choose between 2026 and 2027 batch. If the candidate does not get any service in 2027 exam, he will be allowed to go back and join the service allocated based on CSE 2026. If the candidate does not join training of the finally chosen service (2026 or 2027), both the allocations shall get cancelled.After availing one improvement attempt (CSE-2027), the candidate cannot appear in CSE-2028 onwards unless he/she resigns from service. Candidates already in service from CSE-2025 or earlier, will have one chance to reappear in CSE 2026 or CSE 2027 without resigning. If they wish to appear for CSE 2028 and beyond, they must first resign from the allocated service. UPSC in its CSE 2026 notification has also done away with the cap on examination centre capacity for 'persons with benchmark disabilities' (PwBD) candidates , allowing them to be accommodated on priority. Initially, the existing capacity of each centre will be utilised by both PwBD and non-PwBD candidates. However, once a centre reaches full capacity, it will no longer be available for selection by non-PwBD candidates, while PwBD candidates will continue to have the option to select the same centre.CSE 2026 will also have more examination centres -- Meerut to decongest Delhi-NCR, Kanpur to ease pressure around Lucknow, and Bhubaneswar to supplement centres near Cuttack. It further allows candidates to indicate their preferred nearby cities from a dropdown menu, in addition to the notified examination centres. This data will serve as a survey of candidate preferences and may be used to identify locations for the creation of new examination centres, where feasible.","The updated rules for the elite recruitment exam bar candidates already appointed to IAS or IFS, from appearing in CSE 2026.

JAMMU: Border-related challenges had changed significantly over the past 60 years, and therefore advanced technological solutions must be adopted to effectively address them, Union home minister Amit Shah said Friday as he visited the Gurnam and Bobiyan outposts located along the India-Pakistan International Border in Kathua district of Jammu and Kashmir Later in the evening, Shah chaired a high-level security review meeting in Jammu at Lok Bhavan, which was attended by LG Manoj Sinha, Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi, Union home secretary, IB director, J&K chief secretary and DGP, heads of CAPFs and other senior officers.At the meeting, while the home minister appreciated the efforts of the security agencies in dismantling the terror ecosystem, he directed them to remain alert and continue work in a coordinated mode to ensure that the gains made in recent times are sustained and the goal of a ‘terror free J&K’ is achieved at the earliest. He assured that all the resources would be made available by the govt to achieve this.Shah said the terror eco-system nurtured by elements inimical to the country in J&K had been almost crippled due to the concerted efforts of the Narendra Modi govt. Efforts for de-radicalisation had seen major success, he said, and instructed for taking more initiatives for youth engagement. Innovative measures to further reinforce the watertight security cordon were also discussed in the meeting.This was the second security review meeting chaired by the Union home minister within a month. On Jan 8, he had chaired a high-level review meeting in Delhi on J&K’s security situation.Earlier in the day, the home minister, addressing BSF personnel at the border posts in the sensitive Hiranagar sector, said while courage, alertness and dedication of personnel remained crucial, many emerging challenges were now technology-driven. “The govt will invest substantial funds to modernise the entire border security system based on technology. This modernisation will provide improved border infrastructure and advanced equipment for BSF personnel, enabling them to perform their duties more effectively,” he said.Lauding the border guarding troops, Shah said whenever the country’s borders had faced threats of intrusion or infiltration, BSF had stood like an impregnable wall, resolute in its commitment to safeguarding the nation. “The bravery and valour displayed by BSF during Operation Sindoor have added a golden chapter to its six-decade-long history,” he added.The home minister commended the sacrifices of BSF sub-inspector Mohammed Imteyaz and constable Deepak Chingakham in Pakistani firing during Operation Sindoor.Under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi, the Govt of India was fully committed to the welfare of security personnel, the minister said, and announced that a special welfare scheme for BSF personnel will be introduced soon. He also appreciated the significant contribution of BSF women personnel towards border security. He later had lunch with the soldiers.","Amit Shah visited the Gurnam and Bobiyan outposts located along the India- Pakistan International Border in Kathua district of Jammu and Kashmir.

HAL Clarifies AMCA Status, Says It Will Bid For India's Fifth-Generation Fighter Jet In 2035 Phase

NEW DELHI: Rubbishing speculation of possible delays in the delivery of the first batch of indigenous LCA Mk1A fighter jets to IAF, Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) on Thursday said that “five LCA Mk1A aircraft are fully ready for delivery, incorporating major contracted capabilities in accordance with the agreed specifications”.HAL also said that “an additional nine aircraft have already been built and flown. Upon receipt of engines from General Electric (US company), these aircraft will be made ready for delivery”. “All design and development issues identified are being addressed in an expedited manner. HAL is in active discussions with IAF to deliver the aircraft at the earliest,” it said in a statement.HAL has received five engines from GE as on date. The supply position from GE is positive, and the future delivery outlook aligns with HAL’s delivery plans, the company said. HAL assured that it will meet the guidance projected for the current financial year.Besides LCA Mk1A aircraft, the company said it is simultaneously advancing multiple strategic programmes, including Indian Multi Role Helicopter (IMRH), Tejas LCA Mk2 and Combat Air Teaming System (CATS), all of which are expected to enter production after 2032.HAL had received the first contract from IAF for 83 LCA Mk1A jets (73 fighters and 10 trainers) in Feb 2021, and later, a follow-on contract in Sept 2025 for 97 additional LCA Mk1A aircraft (68 fighters and 29 twin-seaters) at a cost of over Rs 62,370 crore.The delivery of these aircraft would commence during 2027-28 and be completed over a period of six years.The aircraft would have an indigenous content of over 64%, with 67 additional items incorporated. In all, IAF had ordered 180 of these aircraft in two tranches.Some of the planes were supposed to be delivered last year, but IAF insisted that HAL provide the aircraft in a fully operational configuration. On Oct 17 last year, the company conducted the first flight of the first Tejas Mk1A prototype from its Nashik facility. At present, HAL’s fighter aircraft production capacity stands at 24 aircraft per year. At this rate, fulfilling the 180 aircraft Tejas Mk1A order would take over seven years, with IAF expected to receive the complete fleet no earlier than around 2033.Beyond the 180 Mk1A jets, IAF had previously acquired 40 LCA Mk1 (IOC/FOC variants), making a total of 220 LCA-type aircraft contracted or ordered across all variants.","HAL has received five engines from GE as on date.

NEW DELHI: Over half a crore highway car users have bought FASTag Annual Pass in past six months since this scheme was launched and there have been 26.5 crore toll payments using the pass @ Rs 15 each at plazas.Data show that there has been a 50% increase in trips of car users who usually took up to a maximum of 100 trips in a year, indicating how the annual pass has encouraged people for more highway travel.NHAI officials said around 28% of total car transactions recorded on the NH network are now being carried out through the FASTag Annual Pass. They added that increased penetration of annual pass among private car users will also help the highways authority for better implementation of Multi Lane Free Flow (MLFF) or barrier-less toll collection, which is being rolled out.“The region-wise analysis shows Chandigarh leads in terms of usage, accounting for 14% of total annual pass transactions across the country, followed by Tamil Nadu at 12.3% and Delhi at 11.5%. These figures demonstrate widespread adoption of the annual pass across diverse geographies from northern urban centres to southern states,” NHAI said.As per the highways authority Bijwasan toll plaza, Delhi-NCR has recorded the maximum of around 57% of total car crossings at the fee plaza using the annual pass, followed by Mundka in Delhi-NCR and Jhinjholi plaza in Sonipat, both registering around 53% of non-commercial vehicle crossings using the annual pass.Applicable across 1,150 fee plazas on national highways and national expressways, the annual pass eliminates the need to frequently recharge FASTag through one-time fee payment of Rs 3,000 for one year validity or 200 toll plaza crossings. The charge for annual pass will be hiked in April aligning with the revision of toll charges.The annual pass gets activated within two hours on the existing FASTag linked to the vehicle after payment of one-time fee through Rajmargyatra app or NHAI website.","Data show that there has been a 50% increase in trips of car users who usually took up to a maximum of 100 trips in a year.

Not only that, 2,677 or about 85% of seats in clinical specialties bagged by those with scores below the initial cut-off were in private medical colleges as well. In comparison, only 485 clinical specialty seats in govt colleges were filled by those with scores below the initial cut-off.Tuition fees are highest for clinical specialties in private colleges.General category candidates benefited the most from the cut-off reduction as they accounted for over 56% of those admitted with scores below the first cut-off. OBCs accounted for 26%, and SC and ST candidates 11% and 6%, respectively. The skew is even more pronounced among those who got clinical specialities in private colleges - 70% were from the general category, and about 20% were OBC.

Sixty-nine candidates with less than 50 marks got admission. This included 39 from general, 20 from OBC, seven from SC and three from ST category.The ""consolidated list of PG students"" admitted under NEET 2023 was put up on June 13, 2024, on the NMC website but gives data only for about 43,900 seats. According to the health ministry's reply to a Rajya Sabha question in July 2024, there were 54,834 PG seats in medical colleges in 2023. This indicates that data for over 10,900 seats is missing from the list.It does not, for instance, include data of PG seats in central govt-funded colleges such as PGI Chandigarh, JIPMER and all the AIIMS.

What’s at stake when it comes to your plate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/whats-at-stake-when-it-comes-to-your-plate/articleshow/127979060.cms,"Thirukkural with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres. Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece. ‘Would you like fries with that?’ The girl behind the counter asked the American standing before me at the McDonald’s outlet. He hesitated. A long hesitation for what should have been the simplest of decisions. Big Mac. Drink. Fries. Yes or no. I grew impatient. Why was his choice so difficult? Only later did it strike me that the difficulty did not lie in the fries. It lay in the burger itself. Vegetarian. Vegan . Flexitarian. A single patty had splintered into moral choices. In that moment, under fluorescent lights and digital menus, I realised that food , once a matter of hunger , had quietly become a matter of conscience. The World Economic Forum recently published data on changing global food habits. Vegetarianism, once considered marginal in the West, is steadily rising across Europe and the United States. Curiously, it is declining in large emerging economies such as India, where traditional diets are slowly yielding to speed, packaging and convenience. Among Gen Z in Europe, vegetarianism is being embraced with fresh intensity: protecting animals, reducing environmental strain. The logic is simple. Growing plants asks less of the earth than raising animals. Vegetables require less land, water and energy. Fewer forests are cleared, fewer resources extracted, fewer gases released. That is why a vegetarian diet produces nearly two and a half times less carbon emissions than a meat-based one. Eating vegetarian for a year can save emissions equal to removing a small family car from the road for six months. Yet the case for meat-eating carries its own dignity. Across history, meat has been nourishment in difficult climates, insurance against crop failure, and a compact source of strength where options were limited. For many communities even today, meat is not indulgence but woven into livelihoods and traditions. In this light, meat-eating is not moral neglect, but practical inheritance. But long before climate charts and sustainability panels, the Tamil land approached food through a softer instinct—not calculation, but empathy. Across the world today, vegetarianism is no longer eccentric. Silicon Valley entrepreneurs adopt plant-based diets for health and longevity. European govts encourage reduced meat consumption. What appears newly awakened is, in truth, deeply old. This is where Thiruvalluvar excels as a poet of compassion. Avisorinthu āayiram vēṭṭalin oṉdṟaṉ Uyirsegutthu uṇṇāamai naṉdṟu Better than a thousand burnt offerings Is One life un-killed, un-eaten . A thousand ritual fires may blaze, but they do not equal the quiet mercy of restraint. Tamil Sangam literature echoes this gentleness. Puranānūru speaks of ascetics as kollā nōṉbiṉar, those who have vowed not to kill. Akanānūru describes hospitality through rice, milk, curd, fruits, honey, and vegetables. Meat appears openly in most places; its absence elsewhere is deliberate. Vegetarian food is not portrayed as denial, but as choice shaped by feeling. Power too once learned restraint. Emperor Ashoka’s edicts from the third century BCE recorded reduced slaughter, protected animals, and banned killing on certain days. After Kalinga, remorse hardened into mercy, carved into stone. Valluvar reminds us that progress is not only about what we invent but about what we choose not to harm. It was the same voice that echoed in saint poet Vallalar’s verse: ‘I shed tears seeing plants that wither without water’. And somewhere between a burger choice and a spared life, the question remains quietly unanswered.","The Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127981030,imgsize-52668,width-1000,height-562,resizemode-75/127981030.jpg"

A tourism map still in motion



For years, planning a holiday in India meant choosing between two familiar choices: beach or hills. Goa or Manali. Sand or snow.Not anymore.Today, the most searched destinations on travel apps are just as likely to be Ayodhya as Alibaug, Varanasi as Vagator, Ujjain as Udaipur. A generation that grew up posting sunsets from shacks and selfies from mountain cafés is now booking flights to temple towns, river ghats and heritage streets.India’s tourism map is changing — quietly, steadily, and faster than many imagined.Across India, places once considered peripheral to mainstream tourism – religious towns, heritage cities, riverfront settlements and small cultural hubs – are emerging as year-round travel destinations.Ayodhya, Varanasi, Ujjain, Prayagraj, Dwarka, Puri, Hampi, Madurai and Maheshwar are no longer niche or purpose-driven stops. They are becoming central nodes in India’s tourism geography, drawing millions of travellers who are not just pilgrims, but explorers, photographers, students, influencers, backpackers and international visitors.What’s driving this change is not one factor, but a convergence: religious revival, infrastructure investment, social media discovery, generational travel habits, and a redefinition of what “travel” means in India today.The most decisive force reshaping India’s tourism map is the scale and transformation of religious travel.India has always been a land of pilgrimage, but for much of the post-liberalisation era, religious tourism remained largely disconnected from mainstream travel narratives. Pilgrims travelled with families, stayed briefly, and rarely engaged with destinations beyond ritual.That distinction has collapsed.Data from the Union ministry of tourism and state governments shows that religious tourism now accounts for more than half of all domestic tourist visits in India. In several states, pilgrimage-led travel has overtaken leisure tourism as the primary driver of footfall.Uttar Pradesh illustrates this transformation most starkly. The state reported over 130 crore domestic tourist visits in a single year – 2025, making it India’s most visited state. The surge has been driven overwhelmingly by pilgrimage and heritage circuits connecting Ayodhya, Prayagraj, Varanasi and Mathura–Vrindavan.Ayodhya, once a relatively modest religious town, has undergone a dramatic transformation since the inauguration of the Ram Temple. Annual visitor numbers now run into millions, outpacing several long-established heritage destinations.The city’s airport, railway station, road network and public spaces have been redeveloped to accommodate a scale of travel previously unimaginable for a town of its size.Last year’s Maha Kumbh in Prayagraj, a once in 144 year affair, alone drew footfalls on a scale rarely seen anywhere in the world, making it the largest religious congregation, so much so that it was even visible from space.Varanasi, long considered a place one visited once in a lifetime, has emerged as one of India’s fastest-growing cultural destinations. State government figures show tourist visits crossing 10 crore annually in 2024, with foreign arrivals rising sharply over the past three years. What was once seen primarily as a site of ritual and renunciation is now firmly embedded in India’s travel economy.Tamil Nadu tells a similar story. Temple circuits linking Madurai, Rameswaram, Kanchipuram and Tiruvannamalai account for a majority of domestic travel into the state, drawing millions annually.Maharashtra’s Shirdi–Pandharpur belt, Odisha’s Puri, Madhya Pradesh’s Ujjain and Maheshwar, and Gujarat’s Dwarka and Somnath now function as high-volume, year-round tourism economies. Karnataka’s Udupi and Hampi, and West Bengal’s Kalighat and Dakshineswar reflect similar patterns.“Faith has become infrastructure-led,” said a senior employee of a travel agency in Delhi, working at a tech savvy firm which thrives on social media added, “Once access improved, demand exploded.” He says, the jump in visit plans to cities like Varanasi, Chopta, Kedharnath has increased manyfold, and when the char dham yatra opens, demand shoots up.Interestingly the crowd mostly has youths, reflecting a shift from assumed travel preferences.If religious tourism is the backbone of the new travel map, religious events are its accelerators.India’s religious calendar is dense with gatherings that combine faith, spectacle, culture and community – often on a scale unmatched anywhere else in the world. These events are no longer seen only as spiritual congregations; they have become major tourism drivers with global visibility and measurable economic impact.The Maha Kumbh Mela at Prayagraj, held once every 12 years at the Sangam of the Ganga, Yamuna and Saraswati, remains the best example. The most recent edition drew hundreds of millions of visits over several weeks, making it the largest human gathering on the planet – so vast that it was visible in satellite imagery. Beyond the ritual bathing, the Kumbh now attracts cultural tourists, photographers, researchers, vloggers and international visitors seeking to witness a phenomenon unmatched in scale.By the end of the event over 660 million people took a dip in Triveni Sangam. The festival generated approximately 1.2 million jobs in sectors like tourism, transportation, healthcare, and retail, significantly boosting the both state and national economies.The organisation of the event saw major revamp for the city, from over 200 roads renovated and 3 lakh plus trees planted.Post event data released by the state shows, trade in daily essentials reached Rs 17,310 crore, while the hotel and travel sectors were at Rs2,800 crore. Religious materials and flowers generated approximately Rs 2,000 crore and Rs 800 crore, respectively.Alongside the Maha Kumbh, the Magh Mela, held annually at Prayagraj, has emerged as a major draw in its own right. While smaller than the Kumbh, it attracts crores of devotees over its duration, sustaining tourism flows every year rather than once a decade.Temporary cities rise on the riverbanks, supported by transport networks, sanitation infrastructure and cultural programming – an example of how religious events are now treated as logistical and tourism exercises at scale.“These events create massive short-term employment and long-term tourism memory,” said an official involved in last year's Mela administration. “People return later with families, friends, even tour groups.” He added, “during mela people come to stay for weeks at times the entire month of snan.”In eastern India, the Puri Rath Yatra draws millions of devotees annually, turning the coastal town into a global focal point for weeks. Odisha government estimates show hotel occupancy peaking across the state during the festival period, while transport networks operate at full capacity.Artisans, street vendors and small businesses see a surge in income, while the event also introduces many first-time visitors to Odisha’s beaches, crafts and heritage circuits.In Varanasi, Dev Deepawali has evolved from a local religious observance into a marquee tourism event. Lakhs of lamps illuminate the ghats of the Ganga on Kartik Purnima, drawing domestic and foreign travellers months in advance.If you think you can walk past the roads of the old holy city easily during and around the month of Diwali, think again. Every corner of the city is filled with people, tourists and visitors. Ghats bustle through the night and probably the night life is never better there.Durga Puja in Kolkata, now recognised by UNESCO, blends religion, art, music and urban culture, drawing tourists not just from India but from Bangladesh, Europe and Southeast Asia.Similarly, Deepotsav in Ayodhya, Holi in Mathura–Vrindavan and Barsana, Navratri in Gujarat, and Thrissur Pooram in Kerala,function as major tourism magnets. These festivals blend religion, culture, music, food and visual spectacle, extending stays and broadening visitor profiles beyond traditional pilgrims.“The festivals are no longer spikes; they are anchors,” said Naveen Singh, a resident of Varanasi who runs a hotel. “They fill rooms, generate repeat visits and stabilize demand.”What is notable is that these events are no longer treated as isolated spikes. State tourism boards actively integrate them into annual calendars, align transport and accommodation planning, and promote them digitally as experiential travel moments.The transformation of religious destinations is not only about numbers.What’s changed is not just where people are travelling, but how they are travelling. Increasingly it is about how these places are experienced, the mark that the visit leaves on the people's mind.Cities like Varanasi, Ujjain and Dwarka are no longer framed merely as sites of ritual obligation. They are increasingly experienced as layered cultural spaces. They are being reimagined – by travellers as much as by planners – as experience-led destinations.Morning boat rides on the Ganga, evening Ganga aartis framed by restored ghats, heritage walks through ancient neighbourhoods, classical music performances, local food trails, classical music performances, and café culture tucked into centuries-old lanes – all now form part of the itinerary.The sacred and the everyday coexist – and travellers engage with both.This shift has been enabled by sustained infrastructure investment: expanded airports, redeveloped railway stations, improved roads, pedestrian corridors, lighting projects and riverfront development.Government schemes such as PRASHAD and Swadesh Darshan have focused on improving tourist facilities around religious and heritage sites, while state tourism departments have leaned into festival-led tourism to keep destinations active year-round.What emerges is a new category of travel – one that blends faith, culture, leisure and storytelling.Leading travel companies of the country are also playing a crucial role in facilitating these travel experiences. Providing millions of devotees and visitors seamless travel solutions, including flight bookings, customized pilgrimage packages, and guided experiences, ensuring a smooth spiritual journey for attendees.While speaking at an event, Rikant Pittie, CEO and Co-Founder, EaseMyTrip said:“Spiritual tourism in India is witnessing significant growth as more travellers seek meaningful experiences at sacred destinations. In 2024, India’s religious tourism market was valued at US$ 202.8 billion, and is expected to grow to US$ 441.2 billion by 2032. Pilgrimage sites like Varanasi, Rishikesh, Tirupati, and Shirdi are attracting millions of devotees annually, contributing to both cultural preservation and economic growth. With improved infrastructure and digital advancements, accessibility to these sites has become easier, further fueling interest in spiritual travel.”India’s foreign tourist arrivals are yet to fully recover to pre-Covid levels, and international media has pointed to concerns ranging from cost to pollution and infrastructure stress. But the recovery, where it is happening, is highly destination-specific.Foreign travellers are increasingly gravitating toward cultural depth rather than checklist sightseeing. Hampi and parts of Rajasthan (deserts and old cities) and Madhya Pradesh, the likes of Khajuraho, and select Himalayan towns have seen renewed interest from overseas visitors looking for immersive experiences – slow travel, spiritual exploration, history, architecture, and everyday life.For many international travellers, India’s emerging destinations offer something that over-touristed global cities no longer do: authenticity without over-curation.For instance, global pop icon Dua Lipa’s travel pattern to India offers a telling anecdote. She first visited the country in 2018 for a vacation with her then boyfriend Issac Carew, explored several iconic locations, including Ranthambore, Jaipur, Jodhpur, Kerala, and Goa.She returned again in 2023 on her fourth visit to the country, in late December to spend New Year with her family, this time in a very low profile exploring streets and small towns of Rajasthan. The trip was so out of the media gaze that people only found out about it once Dua herself posted pictures on her social media. Interestingly, during her interaction and exploration with people on streets she received warm welcome and hospitality, but notably no one recognised her to the star she is.Perhaps the most consequential shift reshaping India’s tourism geography is generational.India’s Gen Z and young millennial travellers are not chasing the same markers of travel that defined earlier decades. Monuments still matter, but they are no longer the sole focus. For this cohort, travel is experiential, social and performative.For many, travel is not an escape from daily life, but an extension of identity – curated, shared and remembered through content.Suchna Yadav, a content creator/ influencer working with a travel agency in Delhi says, ""I used to think maybe i'm little old school in my choices or something, that i like visiting the places like Vridnavan, or Chopta temple and other places, but working here made me realise that actually it's not just me. The number of young people I see opting to visit places like Kedarnath, temple circuit in UP, Vaisno Devi and that to in groups (like a group of young guys, or friends, and then families are always there) is just like okay everyone is searching peace. ""Travel platforms report a sharp rise in bookings to spiritual and heritage destinations among travellers under 35, often combining pilgrimage with leisure, photography and food exploration.Well many today discover and decide their travel plans according to the social media, but there are also people who have it the old classic way – movies.Aastha Jha, a young journalist working in Delhi has been to Varanasi twice. She started off her travel journey from the city and her most recent visit has been there as well. The reason? ‘Masaan’ (movie).“Watching Masaan, I was so fascinated by the ‘Ye dukh kahe khatam nahi hota be’ scene, that I made up my mind...if I travel, I will definitely go to Benaras,” she said.Social media has fundamentally altered how destinations are discovered.Instagram reels, YouTube vlogs and travel influencers have turned once-understated towns into aspirational stops. A single viral sunset video from Dwarka or a café walkthrough in Varanasi can reach millions.This has changed the rhythm of tourism:In this new ecosystem, travel is not always about escape. It is about visibility, storytelling and identity.Beyond the headline destinations, India’s tourism boom is quietly lifting lesser-known places into the spotlight.These destinations benefit from a trickle-down effect – travellers extending trips, seeking quieter experiences, or deliberately avoiding crowds.Alongside religious festivals, concerts and large-scale cultural events have emerged as powerful drivers of domestic travel.These events often trigger short, high-intensity travel bursts, filling hotels, boosting transport demand and introducing new audiences to destinations.The effect is cumulative: travellers arrive for an event, discover a place, and return later for leisure or exploration.Over the past couple of years multiple national and international celebrities have held concerts across the country, and their impact has been phenomenal.Now a global superstar Diljit Dosanjh ‘Dil-Luminati’ tour was a sold out game, spanning through multiple cities and the story was the same everywhere, immense demand and sold-out, high-energy shows. So has been the results of Lollapalooza India, Sunidhi Chauhan’s ‘I am Home India tour’ and Shreya Ghosal’s ‘All Hearts Tour’ all of which have been monumental successes.The massive crowd in every show has not been only the locals but people travel cities, states to attend these concerts and events.Similarly, international acts like The Coldplay concerts, Ed Sheeran’s India tour, Maroon 5, Cigarettes After Sex, Akon and many others triggered massive short-term travel spikes. Hotels sold out, flight fares surged, and cities that rarely featured on tourism maps saw first-time visitors.Last year when Coldplay performed in Ahmedabad, the record-breaking shows, featuring 1.34 lakh attendees, created a massive Rs 641 crore economic impact.One of the attendees was Kikruheno Casavi, then a student in Delhi now a working professional in Kohima. She along with her friends who flew all the way from Kohima visited the Ahmedabad, paid much more for the flights to hands down everything from hotels to local travel and food, when compared to regular time, given the high demand, at the end she ended of spending close to lakh on the concert, that was a good influx into the economy. So has been the impact of these massive events on the domestic travel and economy.One of the most profound changes in Indian tourism is how destinations are discovered.For decades, tourism marketing centred on a narrow set of icons – beaches, palaces, monuments. Today, social media has emerged as a powerful equaliser. A single Instagram reel of a sunset in Dwarka or a café walk-through in Varanasi can reach millions, bypassing traditional campaigns entirely.Unlike curated brochures or seasonal campaigns, digital storytelling is organic, constant and often driven by travellers themselves. A single reel, vlog or photo series can introduce millions to places that once barely featured on travel maps. As a result, destinations are no longer marketed only as pilgrimage stops or heritage sites, but as spaces for culture, leisure, food and everyday exploration.Travel platforms, too, have adapted. Pilgrimage packages now integrate leisure, experiences and flexible itineraries. Boutique stays, heritage homestays and experiential tours have become anchors of tourism ecosystems.The change in narrative – from “must-see” landmarks to “must-feel” moments – has made India’s emerging destinations more accessible, relatable and aspirational, particularly for younger travellers.In many ways, the tourism boom reflects not a discovery of new places, but a reframing of familiar ones – amplified by platforms where authenticity, not advertising, now drives attention.The tourism shift has tangible economic consequences. Hospitality players report higher occupancy rates across the year, not just during peak seasons. Local economies – transport operators, guides, artisans, food vendors – benefit from sustained demand rather than seasonal spikes.At the same time, challenges are mounting. Overcrowding, waste management, environmental stress and infrastructure capacity pose real risks. Experts warn that without heritage-sensitive planning and sustainability measures, the very qualities drawing travellers could be compromised.What’s clear is that India’s tourism map is no longer static – or metro-centric.It is being reshaped by faith and culture, by digital discovery, by younger travellers redefining value, and by destinations once overlooked now stepping into the national and global imagination.The shift underway is not about discovering new places, but about seeing familiar ones differently. And in that reframing, India’s tourism future is quietly being rewritten.And in that shift, the most interesting stories may lie far beyond Mumbai and Goa.","India’s tourism map is changing — quietly, steadily, and faster than many imagined. Places once considered peripheral to mainstream tourism are emerging as year-round travel destinations. The most searched destinations on travel apps are just as likely to be Ayodhya as Alibaug, Varanasi as Vagator.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127992027,imgsize-149154,width-400,resizemode-4/changing-tourism-map-of-india.jpg"

Siddaramaiah, DK Shivakumar Project Unity After High-Stakes Karnataka Meet Amid Rumours Of Cong Rift

Shivakumar's sarcastic response

What's the controversy

NEW DELHI: Congress MLC Yathindra Siddaramaiah on Friday said he believed there would be no change in Karnataka’s leadership and that his father Siddaramaiah was likely to remain chief minister for the full five-year term.Speaking to reporters in Mysuru, Yathindra said the party high command had given a clear signal, even if not publicly, that there will be no leadership change. He said the issue was settled and that no one in the party had said Siddaramaiah should be removed.“According to me, the high command might not have said it openly, but have given a clear signal that there will not be any leadership change. So I believe that Siddaramaiah will be the CM for five years,” he said.Yathindra also said that apart from media discussions, the leadership change issue was not being discussed in political circles. He added that the government should focus on other matters, including the upcoming budget and the state’s financial situation.Deputy chief minister D K Shivakumar , who is also seen as a contender for the chief minister’s post, responded sarcastically to Yathindra’s remarks.“Yathindra is our high command, and let's accept what he says very respectfully,” Shivakumar told reporters in Mangaluru.He added that if anyone had to clarify the issue, it would be the party’s central leadership in Delhi.The leadership issue had gained attention after the Congress government completed half of its five-year term in November 2025. There has been speculation about a possible power-sharing arrangement between Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar when the government was formed in 2023.Shivakumar has previously said discussions on the issue were held with the Congress high command and that while a decision had been taken, its timing is yet to be finalised.Last month, DK Shivakumar’s brother had said Rahul Gandhi had assured the deputy chief minister that a decision would be taken at an appropriate time.",Yathindra Siddaramaiah says there will be no leadership change in Karnataka.

Delhi Govt begins drafting bill for Delhi Unified Metropolitan Transport Authority,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-govt-begins-drafting-bill-for-delhi-unified-metropolitan-transport-authority/articleshow/127985892.cms,".

In a major institutional reform aimed at transforming urban mobility in the national capital, the Delhi government under the leadership of Chief Minister Rekha Gupta has initiated the process of drafting a comprehensive Bill for the creation of the Delhi Unified Metropolitan Transport Authority (DUMTA) along with a dedicated Delhi Urban Transport Fund (DUTF).""The proposed legislation seeks to rationalise, integrate and coordinate Delhi's presently fragmented transport ecosystem under a single, coherent planning and governance framework. The move marks a significant milestone in the government's vision to create a modern, efficient, people-centric and environmentally sustainable transport system for the Capital,"" a statement read.To ensure expeditious and inclusive drafting of the proposed law, the statement said that the Chief Minister has constituted a high-level task force under the Chairmanship of the Chief Secretary. ""The task force has been mandated to prepare and submit the draft Bill at the earliest, reflecting the government's sense of urgency and commitment to reform. This decision responds to long-standing demands from urban planners, transport experts and civic stakeholders for a unified transport authority capable of synchronising planning, investment and operations across agencies. ""Recognising that Delhi's rapid urbanisation, rising population and mounting vehicular pressure demands systemic solutions rather than piecemeal interventions, the Chief Minister has taken a proactive step by setting the legislative process in motion.The task force brings together senior officials from key departments including transport, urban development, finance, planning, public works and Delhi Police. It also includes representatives from major civic and transport authorities such as the Delhi Development Authority, the Municipal Corporation of Delhi, Delhi Metro Rail Corporation, Delhi Transport Corporation, the National Capital Region Transport Corporation and Indian Railways. CM has suggested that renowned experts in urban transportation may also be co-opted to ensure that global best practices and local realities are seamlessly integrated into the proposed framework.Explaining the rationale behind the initiative, Chief Minister Rekha Gupta noted that Delhi's transport agencies have historically functioned in silos, with limited coordination in route planning, infrastructure development and service delivery.""DUMTA will bring cohesion to Delhi's entire urban mobility system. By placing all modes of transport like metro, buses, regional rail, railways and feeder services, within a single planning jurisdiction, we will ensure that mobility solutions are integrated, efficient and citizen-focused,"" the CM said.The Chief Minister emphasised that DUMTA will play a critical role in decongesting Delhi's roads by strengthening public transport, improving last-mile connectivity and encouraging a shift away from private vehicles.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday refused to entertain a petition filed by Prashant Kishor ’s Jan Suraaj Party challenging the 2025 Bihar assembly elections. A bench comprising CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi declined to issue any direction on the request to annul the election results and order fresh polls.“How many votes did your political party get?

The party claimed the move amounted to a corrupt practice and disturbed the level playing field.The scheme provides an initial financial grant of Rs 10,000 to women to promote self-employment and small businesses.

From Exam Stress to Life Skills: PM Modi Engages Students in Pariksha Pe Charcha 2026

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday interacted with students across the country in the 9th edition of Pariksha Pe Charcha 2026, offering guidance on exams, personal growth, skills, technology use and nation-building ahead of the board examination season.During the interactive session, PM Modi engaged in a wide-ranging conversation with students, addressing exam stress, time management, leadership, wellness and pursuing dreams. Later, students also sang self-composed songs before him.As examinations of CBSE, ISCE and other state boards approach, PM Modi interacted with select “exam warriors” as part of the annual programme. This year, the interactive sessions were held with students from Devmogra in Gujarat, Coimbatore in Tamil Nadu, Raipur in Chhattisgarh and Guwahati in Assam, besides the prime minister’s official residence in New Delhi.The 2026 edition of Pariksha Pe Charcha focused on helping students remain stress-free during examinations and encouraging a stronger emphasis on learning, in line with the National Education Policy 2020.PM Modi told students, “Not dreaming is a crime. One should definitely dream, but merely humming about dreams never works. Therefore, one should consider action as paramount in life.”Highlighting the need for balance, he said students must manage studies, rest, skills and hobbies together.“There should be a balance in everything in life. If you lean too much to one side, you will surely fall,” he said.The prime minister stressed that both life skills and professional skills are equally important. “There are two types of skills - life skills and professional skills. If someone asks me which one to focus on, I would say focus on both. They go hand in hand,” he said, adding that skills begin with knowledge and cannot be acquired without learning and observation.“The beginning of skill is with knowledge; its importance cannot be underestimated,” he said.PM Modi cautioned students against treating education as a burden and warned against half-hearted learning. “Education should not feel like a burden. It requires our total involvement. Education in bits and pieces doesn't guarantee success,” he said, adding that exams should never become the ultimate goal.“Life is not just about exams. Education is just a medium for our development. Instead of focusing only on marks, everyone should focus on improvement in life, which goes beyond classrooms and exams,” he added.Speaking about teachers, the prime minister said good educators focus on overall development rather than only exam-oriented teaching. “There are times when teachers only teach what is important for exams, but a good teacher teaches everything and focuses on overall growth,” he said.On digital habits, PM Modi warned students against wasting time online. “Don't just waste time because the internet is cheap in India. I have made a law against betting. We will not let that happen,” he said. While noting that gaming can be a skill if used wisely, he added, “Gaming is a skill. It involves speed and helps personality development, but try to find your expertise by choosing better quality gaming.”Advising students to trust their own study styles while remaining open to guidance, PM Modi said, “Listen to everyone's advice, but change your pattern only when you want to. I have become PM. Still, people tell me to work in different ways. But everyone has their own pattern.”“Some people study better in the morning, some at night. Whatever suits you, believe in that. But also take advice, and if that benefits you, then only add it to your life structure.”Sharing a personal reflection, the prime minister said growth does not mean abandoning core principles. “Even I changed a few things but did not leave my principal pattern,” he said.Reiterating the broader purpose of education, PM Modi said, “Ultimate goal cannot be results in an exam, but all-round development in life.” On mental well-being, he added, “Education should not be a burden and everyone should be totally involved as half-hearted education does not make life successful.”The prime minister also urged students to focus on inner growth and self-awareness. “Tame the mind, then connect the mind, and then keep the subjects you need to study. Then you will always find the student successful,” he said, advising them not to dwell on the past. “Don’t think about the past. Try to live what is in front of you,” he added.Looking ahead to India’s future, PM Modi reminded students of their role in building a developed nation. “You all will be between 35-40 years old in 2047. Who am I working hard for to build a Viksit Bharat? Should you also not work towards it?” he said, calling on young Indians to support domestic manufacturing. “We need to emphasise and ensure to buy and use Indian products,” he added.Calling on students to become responsible citizens, the prime minister stressed cleanliness, awareness and wise use of technology. “Technology is a boon, and we need to embrace it… Use AI wisely to boost your wisdom and personality,” he said.During the interaction, PM Modi welcomed students with the traditional Assamese ‘Gamosa’, describing it as a symbol of women’s empowerment in the Northeast. “This is an epitome of women's empowerment for the Northeast, especially Assam, as the women weave it at home with love and dedication,” he said.Launched in 2018, Pariksha Pe Charcha has grown into one of the country’s largest education engagement initiatives, with more than 4.5 crore registrations recorded this year.","PM Modi engaged in a wide-ranging conversation with students, addressing exam stress, time management, leadership, wellness and pursuing dreams.

"AI, fake me a prescription",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ai-fake-me-a-prescription/articleshow/127971804.cms,"NEW DELHI: Artificial Intelligence is making it easier for people to procure restricted drugs, from antibiotics to addictive pills and high-risk psychotropic compounds, raising serious concerns over patient safety, drug misuse and regulatory failure.Alerted by a doctor who said one of his patients was taking antibiotics based on a fake prescription generated through AI, TOI launched an investigation to find out if such prescriptions could be convincingly created and used to buy medicine.We asked ChatGPT to create an AIIMS OPD card using the institution’s logo and name of an AIIMS doctor. It refused, stating this would “amount to impersonation and could be used as an official medical document.” ChatGPT suggested alternatives such as a generic govt hospital OPD card without branding, a private clinic prescription with fictional details, or a clearly labelled mock sample. When prompted, it created a generic govt hospital OPD card. However, another AI platform, Grok, produced an old OPD card bearing the AIIMS logo.TOI found that prescription images from both govt and private hospitals can be easily downloaded from the internet and edited, with changes made to the patient’s name, age, diagnosis, medicines and date.ChatGPT also offered to format prescriptions in standard govt style, complete with dosage and frequency instructions such as BD or SOS.Prescriptions carrying the name of any hospital, real or fictitious, can thus be created, enabling purchase of antibiotics and psychotropic drugs from online platforms or general chemist shops without any doctor’s consultation. TOI has copies of bills and AI-generated prescriptions that closely resemble genuine medical documents.These fake prescriptions were used to purchase antibiotics including Norflox 400, Metrogyl 400 and Azithromycin 500, all restricted medicines, from an online platform. The hospitals mentioned on the prescription, “Elevate Health Clinic” and “Family Healthcare Clinic”, were fictitious and carried no addresses. Despite this, the pharmacy delivered the medicines. One online pharmacy, however, called back for verification and refused to dispense the drug.More worryingly, Nimesulide 200 mg, recently banned by the govt, was available on an online platform, pointing to weak enforcement even after official prohibition.Dr Sunil Rana, associate director and head of Internal Medicine (unit III) at Asian Hospital, said cases are emerging of people using AI-generated prescriptions to buy medicines. This is especially dangerous with antibiotics, as wrong drugs, doses or duration can lead to antimicrobial resistance. “I increasingly see infections that are difficult to treat because antibiotics were taken incorrectly,” he said, warning that poor prescription verification by some pharmacies was adding to the risk.Though some drugs were unavailable on online platforms, TOI was able to procure Tramadol, an opioid painkiller with a high risk of dependence, and Alprax (alprazolam), a psychotropic antianxiety drug, from offline chemist shops, highlighting serious loopholes in drug sale verification. At one store, the seller hesitated initially but eventually handed over the medicines without issuing a bill, later scribbling the details on plain paper after the correspondent insisted on documentation.Dr Om Prakash, professor at the Institute of Human Behaviour and Allied Sciences (IHBAS), said drugs such as alprazolam and tramadol are meant for short-term, doctor-supervised use, usually for a few days, to treat acute pain, anxiety or distress. Taken without medical evaluation, they carry a high risk of abuse and dependence with chronic use, he warned.In countries such as the US and Canada, patients cannot access prescriptions directly. Doctors send prescriptions electronically to pharmacies, and medicines are dispensed only after identity verification.Under India’s drug laws, Schedule H and Schedule X medicines can only be sold against prescriptions issued by registered medical practitioners. However, weak enforcement and poor verification at both online and offline pharmacies have long subverted the law. The rise of AI-generated prescriptions has now created a new grey zone, allowing documents that appear legitimate to pass muster without scrutiny.Rajiv Singhal, general secretary of the All India Organisation of Chemists and Druggists, said if govt wants to control antimicrobial resistance and misuse of medicines, platforms or AI tools enabling such practices must be acted against immediately. “This kind of activity should be condemned and stopped. Otherwise, it could turn into a serious public health issue with unpredictable consequences,” Singhal said.","Artificial Intelligence is making it easier for people to procure restricted drugs, from antibiotics to addictive pills and high-risk psychotropic compounds.

NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court has held as invalid prohibition on transfer or migration of a medical student from one college to another, and has directed National Medical Commission to formulate a “proper policy” to permit migration.A division bench of Chief Justice D K Upadhyaya and Justice Tejas Karia zeroed in on Regulation 18 of the Graduate Medical Education Regulation, 2023, and termed it “unreasonable and arbitrary”, and violating the Constitution.The bench was dealing with a petition by a medical student with 40% visual impairment who sought migration from Govt Medical College, Barmer to a college in Delhi. The court directed NMC to take a decision within three weeks on the petitioner’s transfer request.“What we find is that in the name of maintaining uniformity, standard and integrity in the matter of medical education across the institutions, total prohibition on transfer or migration of a student, need of which may occur in various situations, including the one which arose in this case, cannot be said to be reasonable; rather, in our opinion, such prohibition is manifestly unreasonable and arbitrary,” the high couty said in its order on Feb 4.The bench observed NMC’s stand that migration was prone to misuse could not be sustained, as the possibility of abuse could not be used to deny legitimate rights to a citizen.The court noted that the medical condition and capabilities of the petitioner were worsening on account of the harsh climate in Barmer, and the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act mandated public bodies to ensure that persons with disabilities (PWDs) were provided “reasonable accommodation” and an “appropriate environment”. Provisions enacted by Parliament, the court said, cannot remain only a decorative and admirable piece of literature kept on a bookshelf.The judges further observed that NMC’s stand that the petitioner was aware of the weather conditions in Barmer before joining a college there was “nothing short of rubbing salt into the wounds”.","The Delhi high court has held as invalid prohibition on transfer or migration of a medical student from one college to another.

Explained: Why India-EU 'Mother Of All Deals' Matters As Trade Talks Enter Final High Stakes Phase

NEW DELHI: Amid opposition allegations over the India-US trade deal, Union agriculture minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Thursday said that the agreement fully safeguards India’s agricultural interests, particularly those of the farm and dairy sectors.Underlining that India’s staple grains, fruits, major crops, millets and dairy products remain completely secure and face no threat whatsoever, Chouhan emphasised that the interests of small and large farmers alike have been fully protected and that the agreement will create fresh opportunities rather than risks for Indian agriculture.Highlighting the export potential unlocked by the agreement, Chouhan, while addressing the media on the issue, noted that India already exports rice to many countries, including the US, and has recently recorded exports worth around Rs 63,000 crore.He said that reduced tariffs will directly benefit India’s rice, spices and textile exports, and that growth in textile exports will help millions of cotton-growing farmers.On certain concerns over an adverse impact of the deal on small farmers, the minister stressed that no sudden or disruptive entry of foreign products into the Indian market will take place.On the confusion triggered by a recent social media post by the US treasury secretary about increased access for American farm products, Chouhan said commerce minister Piyush Goyal has already clarified the facts in Parliament. He reiterated that India has not opened its markets in any way that puts pressure on domestic farmers & that the protections for key agricultural commodities remain intact.“Farmers are our ‘Annadata’, the providers of life. Their welfare is nation’s welfare, and their interests are absolutely secure,” he added.","Shivraj Singh Chouhan: India's staple grains, fruits, major crops, millets and dairy products remain completely secure and face no threat whatsoever.

to Rs 75,368 crore

NEW DELHI: Railways has estimated its earnings from passenger movement at Rs 87,300 crore in 2026-27, little over 9% more than the revised estimate (RE) of current financial year as it continues to introduce more new-age Vande Bharat chair car and sleeper trains, and Amrit Bharat trains, in addition to to adding of other conventional trains.However, it has lowered the revenue from passenger transport for this year than the Budget Estimate (BE) of Rs 92,800 crore, due to nearly 10.6% fall in kms that people travelled or will travel by March 2026.Similarly, in the freight segment, the ministry has estimated earning of around Rs 1.88 lakh crore in FY 27, same that osf BE of FY26 and 6% higher than the RE of current fiscal year. Data also show that railways is likely to end up generating around Rs 1.78 lakh crore by March, around 5.5% less than the target it had set for the current year.Significantly, the revenue from goods transport is set to fall short of target despite railways not lowering the freight loading target of 1,700 million for this year. Data indicates that the revenue fall is due to a reduction of around 1% fall in the distance of goods transported by railways, meaning there may be a shorter distance than what railways had initially estimated.Responding to a question on the earnings of the national transporter, railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said on Monday it has continued to increase revenue both from passenger and freight movement. He added that the revenue from passenger movement has increased from Rs 70,693 crore in FY 24in 2024-25 and the RE for FY 26 is Rs 80,000 crore. Similarly, in the freight segment, revenue has increased from Rs 1.68 lakh crore in FY 24 to Rs 1.71 lakh crore in 2024-25 and it has been pegged at Rs 1.78 lakh crore in the RE of this fiscal year.On why the railways is unlikely to meet the BE target, Vaishnaw said govt always sets an “aspirational” target so that everyone works hard to perform better than earlier. He added that railways has continued registering net revenue for the past three years, which shows how well the national transporter is running its day-to-day operations.As per the Budget document, with higher income, railways estimates to improve its operating ratio (OR) from 98.82% in the current fiscal year to 98.4% in FY 27. OR indicates the money spent for earning every Rs 100. The railways aims to close the next fiscal with Rs 3,000 crore net revenue, around 35% higher than Rs 1,957 crore estimates for FY 26.","Railways has estimated its earnings from passenger movement at Rs 87,300 crore in 2026-27.

Why the GCC Unified Visa matters



Seamless multi-country travel: Visit multiple member states without applying for separate visas, a huge boon for global travellers.

Biometric and border control integration across all six nations. Common digital application and data-sharing platforms. Security and immigration protocols to ensure regional safety and streamlined entry.





The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) comprising of Saudi Arabia , the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait , Bahrain and Oman is moving forward with a long-planned Unified Tourist Visa that could transform travel across the Gulf region. This initiative, often described as a “Schengen-style visa” for the Gulf, aims to let visitors enter all six member states on a single travel permit, eliminating the need to apply for separate visas for each country.Officials sometimes refer to this new permit as the GCC Grand Tours Visa or Unified GCC Tourist Visa. Travel and tourism authorities have repeatedly emphasised that this is not just a travel document but a key step in deeper regional economic integration and tourism growth.Although the unified visa was originally expected to start as early as late 2025, plans have been pushed to 2026 due to the complexity of aligning immigration systems, security protocols and data-sharing across six sovereign states. According to travel industry reporting, the rollout will unfold in stages:No exact day or month has been publicly confirmed yet as authorities have only reiterated that the visa will go live in 2026 (at latest early 2027 according to some officials).The unified GCC visa will be designed primarily for non-citizen visitors (tourists, business travellers, conference attendees and multiple-destination holidaymakers) who want to explore the Gulf without the hassle of applying for individual visas for each country. Key predicted eligibility criteria include:Authorities are expected to launch an online application portal where travellers can submit their details digitally and receive the visa electronically, similar to e-visa systems in other regions.Official fee structures have not yet been confirmed by GCC authorities, but industry sources and draft proposals indicate that the unified visa could cost in the range of US $100–$150 (approx. AED 367–550). This price range would make the unified GCC visa competitive with other regional multi-country visas, and far simpler than paying for six separate tourist visas for each member state.The digital process and single-application design are expected to reduce administrative overheads and processing delays, helping travellers plan trips without multiple embassy visits.While final rules are still pending official publication, proposals for the unified visa include several options:The exact structure (single entry vs multi-entry, extension rules, etc.) will be published when the official visa framework and application system launch, but authorities have emphasized flexibility to accommodate both short holidays and longer multi-destination itineraries.The GCC Unified Visa is considered a game-changer for travel and tourism in the Middle East Officials have drawn inspiration from the European Schengen visa model, though the GCC’s version will be adapted to regional needs and security standards. Before the visa becomes fully operational, GCC member states need to finalise:If pilot testing in late 2026 goes smoothly, widespread availability could follow in early 2027 though authorities remain optimistic about a 2026 launch for general applications.The GCC Unified Visa 2026 promises a major shift in how travellers explore the Gulf. It's launch is expected in 2026 (pilot late-year, full rollout to follow), eligibility includes tourists and other visitors with valid travel credentials, fees is estimated at US $100–$150 range with validity of likely 30–90 days, with single or multiple entries. This unified system could be a milestone for regional travel and a boost for the Gulf’s tourism, business and investment landscape.","The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) is moving forward with a long-planned Unified Tourist Visa that could transform travel across the Gulf region.

Planning to visit a bank in February? It’s smart to check the holiday schedule first, as an unexpected closure can turn a quick errand into a wasted trip. In India, banks observe both national and state-specific holidays, so closure dates may differ from one region to another. In India, bank holidays include both national and state-specific observances, so closure dates can vary across different regions.Banks will remain closed in Sikkim on account of the Losar festival.Banks will be closed in Maharashtra for Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Jayanti.Banks will not operate in Mizoram and Arunachal Pradesh in observance of State Day/Statehood Day.Apart from these, banks will also remain closed on second and fourth Saturdays of the month, according to RBI.Being aware of bank holidays in advance can help customers plan essential financial transactions and avoid last-minute hassles. While branches may remain closed on these days, it does not prevent customers from carrying out routine transactions. Digital banking services, including online banking, ATMs, mobile apps, and UPI, remain fully operational for fund transfers, bill payments, and other regular activities.However, services that require a physical visit such as large cash deposits, cheque clearances, or issuing demand drafts will not be available. To prevent inconvenience, account holders are encouraged to plan these tasks ahead and make full use of digital banking options during closures.","Banks will be closed in Maharashtra for Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Jayanti.

New labour code changes and why companies are making one-time provisions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-labour-code-changes-and-why-companies-are-making-one-time-provisions/articleshow/127929310.cms,"1.

MUMBAI: Most companies reporting their financial results for Q3FY26 are reporting a large one-time provison towards employee benefits attributing it to the new labour code. TOI takes a look at what brought about these changes and how does it affect stakeholders.The change relates mainly to gratuity payments under the Code on Social Security, 2020. The new rules redefine “wages” for calculating gratuity and expand eligibility for fixed-term employees.Under the revised rules, wages used to calculate gratuity must form at least 50% of an employee’s total cost-to-company (CTC). If allowances exceed 50% of CTC, the excess must be added back to wages for gratuity calculation. This increases the base on which gratuity is calculated.The law also allows fixed-term employees to become eligible for gratuity after completing one year of service instead of the earlier five-year requirement. Because of these changes, companies must account for higher future gratuity payouts, forcing them to create one-time provisions in their financial statements.The government introduced the change through the Code on Social Security, 2020, which forms part of four consolidated labour codes replacing 29 older labour laws.The codes were passed by Parliament in 2020, but detailed implementation rules were notified later.The reform aimed to simplify labour laws, improve social security coverage and reflect modern employment practices. A key concern was that many companies structured salaries with a low basic pay and high allowances to reduce statutory payouts such as provident fund and gratuity. The new definition of wages reduces this flexibility.Another trigger was the growing use of fixed-term employment across industries. The government sought to extend social security benefits to such workers, especially in sectors with high attrition and contractual hiring.The new labour codes, including the Social Security Code, came into force on November 21, 2025. While the central framework became effective from that date, states continue to finalise detailed implementation rules.Employees benefit mainly through higher gratuity payouts and wider eligibility. Because gratuity calculations now use a broader wage base, many employees will receive higher retirement or exit benefits.Fixed-term employees, who earlier did not qualify unless they completed five years of service, can now receive gratuity after one year. This benefits workers in sectors with short-term or project-based employment.The changes also aim to bring more transparency to salary structures and expand social security coverage.The financial impact varies depending on salary structure and workforce composition.Manufacturing and heavy industries: These sectors rely heavily on contract and fixed-term workers. The new rules increase gratuity liabilities and could push companies to review workforce models.Technology and IT services: These companies often use allowance-heavy salary structures. They may need to restructure compensation to meet the wage definition norms.Banking and financial services: The sector may see higher statutory benefit costs and increased liabilities for outsourced and contractual staff.Construction: The sector employs a large informal workforce. The new rules increase compliance requirements and settlement obligations.Retail and e-commerce: Companies with seasonal hiring and gig-based employment may face higher employee benefit costs and classification challenges.Healthcare: Round-the-clock operations and contract staffing could raise wage and benefit compliance costs.Manufacturing and heavy industries are expected to make the largest one-time provisions. These sectors typically have a large contract workforce, lower basic salary structures and higher dependence on fixed-term employment, which significantly increases gratuity liabilities.Technology and financial services companies are also likely to see sizeable increases due to changes in salary structure norms, though typically less than manufacturing.","Most companies reporting their financial results for Q3FY26 are reporting a large one-time provison towards employee benefits.

Ramadan 2026 working hours in the UAE explained: Penalties and rules for private sector and government employees,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/ramadan-2026-working-hours-in-the-uae-explained-penalties-and-rules-for-private-sector-and-government-employees/articleshow/127923197.cms,"Ramadan 2026 in UAE: How Will Working Hours Change for You?

Why working hours change during Ramadan in the UAE



UAE Ramadan 2026: Reduced Working Hours for Private and Government Sectors

Private sector during Ramadan 2026 in the UAE: Mandatory two-hour reduction



How it works:



If a regular workday was 8 hours, it becomes 6 hours during Ramadan.

Employers may offer additional flexibility, such as remote work or staggered schedules, provided the reduced hours rule is followed.

This rule is not optional as companies that do not implement the reduction can face legal consequences, including labour complaints and possible penalties if inspected by MoHRE.

Tip for employees:

Government/public sector during Ramadan 2026 in the UAE: Set reduced hours and flexibility



Typical government hours during Ramadan 2026



Monday to Thursday: 9:00 am to 2:30 pm

9:00 am to 2:30 pm Friday: 9:00 am to 12:00 pm (shorter to allow for Jummah prayer and family time)

Flexible arrangements



School hours and broader work-life adjustments during Ramadan 2026 in the UAE



UAE Employers Face Penalties for Ignoring Ramadan Working Hour Laws

Legal backing and employer responsibilities during Ramadan 2026 in the UAE



Employers should:



Apply the two-hour reduction for private sector workers.

Ensure government department staff adhere to the FAHR-issued Ramadan hours.

Offer reasonable flexibility when operationally possible to support employee well-being.

Failure to comply with mandated Ramadan working hours may expose employers to labour disputes, inspections or penalties — especially in the private sector where these reductions are legally binding.

What this means for UAE workers during Ramadan 2026



Shorter workdays with at least two hours reduced for private workers.

Government hours typically from 9 am to 2:30 pm (Mon–Thu) and 9 am to 12 pm (Fri).

Flexibility options such as remote work where feasible.

School schedule adjustments and broader lifestyle shifts in line with Ramadan culture.





As the holy month of Ramadan 2026 approaches (expected to begin around February 18–19, 2026 after the crescent moon sighting), residents and workers across the United Arab Emirates are preparing for annual adjustments to daily routines including reduced working hours in both the private and government sectors. These changes are designed to help employees balance work responsibilities with fasting, prayer and family time during the sacred month.The working-hour adjustments are not just tradition or goodwill, they are formally recognised within UAE labour regulations and official government circulars.Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar, during which many Muslims fast from dawn until dusk, engage in prayer, reflection and community gatherings. In recognition of the physical and spiritual demands of fasting, authorities in the UAE modify work schedules to allow workers time to maintain energy, attend religious activities and manage family life.According to the UAE’s labour law (Federal Decree-Law No. 33 of 2021), working hours during Ramadan are specifically determined by executive regulations, requiring shorter daily schedules for employees unless otherwise authorised.For most private sector employees in the UAE, daily working hours are reduced by two hours throughout Ramadan. This reduction applies to all employees under the Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation (MoHRE), regardless of their religion or fasting status.Any private sector employer who keeps standard hours throughout Ramadan is not complying with UAE labour regulations and can be reported to authorities.For federal government employees, the Federal Authority for Government Human Resources (FAHR) issues specific working schedules to balance productivity and observance.These hours represent a reduction of about 3.5 hours on weekdays and 1.5 hours on Fridays compared with normal schedules.Government entities are also encouraged to introduce flexible work options, including remote work on Fridays for up to 70% of staff where operationally feasible, without affecting service delivery.In addition to workplace changes, school hours are usually shortened during Ramadan to accommodate fasting students and teachers, with many institutions operating on adjusted timetables.At the same time, routine city services such as public parking, tolls and other community functions also adapt their timings to reflect the daily rhythm of Ramadan life.Under UAE law, the obligation to reduce working hours in Ramadan is grounded in Article 17 of the Labour Law and its executive regulations, which explicitly empower authorities to set specific working hours during Ramadan.For 2026’s Ramadan season, likely starting mid-February, both private and public sector employees in the UAE should expect:These changes offer a practical blend of cultural respect and workplace productivity, helping employees maintain spiritual practices without sacrificing essential functions of daily life in the UAE during the holy month.","Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar, during which many Muslims fast from dawn until dusk.

Why Amazon is shutting down Amazon Go and Fresh stores

Amazon recently announced that it is shutting down its Amazon Fresh supermarket chain. The decision of the company to shut down the Amazon Fresh stores will lead to thousands of job cuts across the US. Last week, the e-commerce major announced that it will close around 60 Fresh stores which will put an end to the effort of six-years. As reported by Business Insider, the WARN notices filed in various states confirm the sale of layoffs. As aper the filling, in California only the company will shut down 20 Fresh stores which will affect around 3,900 workers. Most Fresh locations closed to the public on February 1, though California stores will remain open until mid-March due to state law.As Amazon is shutting down the Fresh stores, it has outlined two main options for the affected employees. The company is giving a choice to the employees in which they can either choose the severance pay or can take transfer within the company. The workers will continue to receive their normal pay and benefits for 90 days after the closure announcement, or until April 28. The compensation offered by the company will be based on either the minimum pay for their employee class of their average hours worked over the past 60 days whichever is higher.The report further adds that employees who do not secure another role within the company by late April will then receive severance packages, calculated as one week of pay for every six months of service at Amazon Fresh. Workers are guaranteed a minimum of four weeks’ pay, with the possibility of up to 20 weeks depending on tenure.For those seeking to remain within Amazon, the company is encouraging Fresh workers to apply for similar positions at Whole Foods Stores or Amazon grocery warehouse via its internal A to Z portal. An Amazon spokesperson said: “All affected employees will have the opportunity to apply for open roles within Amazon where available, and we’re providing career transition services to help them explore options.”Amazon Fresh associates typically earned between $16 and $20 per hour, according to data from job site Indeed. Their responsibilities ranged from picking delivery orders to handling checkout operations.Amazon Go and Fresh stores were introduced as Just Walk Out technology, but they struggled to establish a distinctive customer experience and sustainable economic model. On the other hand, Whole Food Market acquired in 2017 by Amazon say strong growth with sales rising more than 40% in recent years. Also, Amazon’s online grocery business also witnessed a surge with perishable grocery sales through Same-Day Delivery growing 40x since January 2025, making fresh groceries one of the most-ordered categories on its platform.",Amazon recently announced that it is shutting down its Amazon Fresh supermarket chain.

Despite a significant selloff in software stocks triggered by Anthropic's legal AI tools, they argue AI will enhance, not replace, existing software, enabling greater productivity and innovation.

Nvidia's Huang chimes in with Pichai, calls selloff 'most illogical thing in the world'

What exactly triggered the selloff

India’s AI Rise Gets Global Push As UN Chief Praises Leadership, Nvidia CEO Predicts Job Surge

Why the fear runs deeper than one plugin

Google CEO Sundar Pichai isn't buying the panic. During the company's earnings call, Pichai pushed back against the market hysteria triggered by Anthropic's new AI plugins, calling it overblown. AI is ""an enabling tool,"" he said, just as it has been for Google 's own products—Search, YouTube and others. Companies ""seizing the moment"" will find the same opportunity ahead, he added.His comments come as software stocks worldwide nurse heavy losses. Anthropic's Claude Cowork plugins, wiped out roughly $285 billion from software, legal tech and financial services stocks in a single session. Analysts dubbed it a 'SaaSpocalypse'. Pichai's view? The scramble is overdone.Pichai isn't alone in questioning the market reaction. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang was even more direct at a Cisco event, calling the selloff ""the most illogical thing in the world."" His take: AI will use existing software tools, not reinvent them. ""Would you use a screwdriver or invent a new screwdriver?"" he asked. Huang added that Nvidia itself has adopted such tools extensively, freeing up employees to focus on designing chips and computer systems.Software company executives have also pushed back, arguing they do far more than just build code. Their offerings include data management and purpose-built solutions that are difficult to replicate, especially for enterprises outside the tech world like retail and oil and gas.Anthropic released 11 open-source plugins for Claude Cowork, its agentic AI assistant for non-technical professionals. Most covered standard enterprise functions—sales, marketing, finance, customer support. But the legal plugin rattled nerves. It automates contract review, NDA triage, compliance checks and legal briefings.Morgan Stanley analyst Toni Kaplan called it ""a sign of intensifying competition"" that could hurt big players in the legal space. The fallout was swift. Thomson Reuters and RELX both closed down around 15%. LegalZoom crashed nearly 20%. Indian IT stocks weren't spared—Infosys ADRs slipped 5.5%, Wipro fell nearly 5%.The concern isn't just about legal workflows. There's a dawning realisation that AI tools can now do far more than most non-techies realise. With relatively simple prompts, they can take over a user's computer, write software, analyse stock market data, manage emails and countless other tasks. People have taken to social media describing how they built their first software program without ever learning to code. Shopify's CEO built software that could interpret his recent MRI.Meta's CFO Susan Li told investors last week that the company has seen a 30% year-over-year increase in output per engineer driven by AI coding tools. Power users have seen an 80% boost.Anthropic's numbers back up the concern. Claude Code hit $1 billion in annualised recurring revenue by November, months after launch. The company is reportedly raising $20 billion at a $350 billion valuation. Jefferies noted that OpenAI is losing corporate ground to Claude, with enterprises now making up 80% of Anthropic's business.Pichai and Huang are betting the panic subsides. Wall Street isn't so sure yet.","Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang dismiss market panic over AI plugins, calling it overblown.

Impact on your Fixed Deposits

Impact on Mutual Funds

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI)-led Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) on Friday kept the repo rate unchanged at 5.25% in line with expectations from market analysts and economists. The decision to hold the repo rate was driven by resilient GDP growth and benign inflation, amid global headwinds.“After a detailed assessment of the evolving macroeconomic conditions and the outlook, the MPC voted unanimously to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 5.25 per cent; consequently, the standing deposit facility (SDF) rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) remains at 5.00 per cent and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 5.50 per cent. The MPC also decided to continue with the neutral stance,” announced RBI governor Sanjay Malhotra.“The MPC noted that since the last policy meeting, external headwinds have intensified though the successful completion of trade deals augurs well for the economic outlook. Overall, the near-term domestic inflation and growth outlook remain positive,” he added.What does the RBI monetary policy say on India’s GDP growth and inflation outlook? What does the decision to keep repo rate at 5.25% mean for your loan EMIs, fixed deposit and mutual fund investments? We take a look:According to RBI, on the growth front, economic activity remains resilient.The First Advance Estimates suggest continuing growth momentum, driven by domestic factors amidst a challenging external environment. The growth outlook remains favourable.The Indian economy continues on a steadily improving trajectory, with real GDP poised to register significantly higher growth of 7.4% in 2025-26, as compared to the previous year, it said.Real GDP growth projections for Q1:2026-27 and Q2 have been revised upwards to 6.9% and 7.0%, respectively . The risks are evenly balanced.The projections for the full year to the April policy have been deferred by RBI as the new GDP series will be released later in the month.RBI noted that the headline CPI inflation remained low in November and December even as it firmed up by one percentage point in these two months. This increase was largely driven by the lower rate of deflation in the food group. Excluding gold, core inflation remained stable at 2.6 per cent in December.“In terms of the headline inflation trajectory, despite the anticipated momentum being muted, unfavourable base effects stemming from large decline in prices observed during Q4:2024-25 would lead to an uptick in y-o-y inflation in Q4:2025-26. Considering all these factors, CPI inflation for 2025-26 is now projected at 2.1 per cent with Q4 at 3.2 per cent. CPI inflation for Q1:2026-27 and Q2 are projected at 4.0 per cent and 4.2 per cent, respectively. Excluding precious metals, the underlying inflation pressures remain muted. The risks are evenly balanced,” RBI governor said.In view of the impending release of the new CPI series (base 2024=100) on February 12, 2026, similar to growth, RBI will now share CPI inflation projection for the full year 2026-27 in the April policy.RBI has cut the repo rate by 1.25% since early 2025. This has led to a similar lowering in loan rates and hence EMIs for borrowers. With the central bank maintaining the status quo on repo rate, EMIs are unlikely to come down further for now.According to Adhil Shetty, CEO, BankBazaar, a status-quo decision reinforces the central bank’s preference to monitor inflation trends, liquidity conditions and transmission before initiating the next phase of rate action.“The cumulative easing already delivered has largely flowed through to retail lending, making home loan rates relatively competitive compared to recent years. Even in a pause scenario, affordability conditions remain supportive, aided by steady spreads, lender competition and selective seasonal concessions. Borrowers can continue to optimize savings by retaining higher EMIs to compress loan tenures and reduce total interest costs,” he says.“Balance transfer opportunities and loan restructuring options also remain relevant for those seeking incremental efficiencies. Stable rates, combined with sustained housing demand and improved project execution, create a conducive environment for long-term home buyers, particularly end users focused on financial predictability rather than short-term rate movements,” he adds.When the RBI cuts the repo rate, banks in turn lower the rates for fixed deposits. “A pause in the repo rate sustains the gradual moderation in deposit returns already underway following earlier policy actions. High-yield fixed deposits are becoming increasingly selective, with most mainstream offerings consolidating within a narrower band. While current liquidity conditions continue to support deposit mobilisation, the likelihood of materially higher FD rates emerging remains limited in a steady-rate environment,” Adhil Shetty says.“Investors assessing locking strategies may benefit from spreading allocations across multi-year tenures to preserve returns before further repricing takes place. Senior citizen premiums remain an advantage, though these too are expected to evolve as banks adjust to a stable but lower reference-rate regime,” he said.According to Adhil Shetty, bond market participants may interpret this as supportive of stable-to-gradually-softening yields, creating a constructive environment for medium- to long-duration debt and gilt funds over time.“For mutual fund investors, a stable rate regime allows capital appreciation opportunities in debt portfolios without immediate yield compression, while equity markets benefit from policy continuity and earnings visibility. A balanced asset allocation approach—combining steady SIP flows in equities with calibrated duration exposure in debt—continues to remain an effective strategy for navigating evolving interest rate cycles,” he says.","The Reserve Bank of India (RBI)-led Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) on Friday kept the repo rate unchanged at 5.25% in line with expectations from market analysts and economists.

Inside the 32-hour operation to contain Mumbai–Pune Expressway gas leak,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/32-hour-delay-what-slowed-punemumbai-expressway-tanker-gas-leak-response/articleshow/127952077.cms,"Pune- Mega Cycling Event, Traffic System, Future Skills & More

What needs to be done immediately

A clearly defined, legally binding SOP must be put in place for responding to chemical and gas tanker emergencies

It should spell out roles of oil companies, district administrations, police, fire brigades, and disaster response teams, along with strict response timelines

Petroleum companies, gas refineries, and chemical manufacturers must be mandated to deploy dedicated rescue and recovery vans, equipped to handle compressed gas leaks

These units should be strategically stationed along major highways and industrial corridors to ensure rapid response

Movement of highly hazardous gas tankers should be restricted to designated time windows — preferably during low-traffic hours — to minimise public risk and allow quicker isolation of accident sites if required

Drivers transporting hazardous materials must undergo compulsory training in emergency response

Each tanker should carry a basic emergency kit capable of addressing minor leakages, along with real-time communication systems to alert authorities instantly

State govts need to invest in specialised training for fire services, police, and disaster management personnel to handle hazardous material emergencies

Regular mock drills on highways and near industrial hubs must be institutionalised

Growing risk on highways

The scale of hazardous material movement across the country is staggering

Nearly 1,000 propylene gas tankers travel daily from refineries in Kochi, Visakhapatnam, Chennai, and Jamnagar, supplying industries across India

In addition, around 4,000 ammonia tankers originate from Maharashtra's industrial hubs such as Taloja and Chembur, moving to southern states and other regions

Experts warn that while propylene is highly flammable, an ammonia leak would be far more dangerous, releasing toxic gases that could make containment virtually impossible in densely populated or high-traffic areas

Expert Speak

PUNE: The 32-hour-long operation to neutralise a leaking propylene gas tanker on the Pune–Mumbai expressway threw a harsh spotlight on the lack of preparedness, specialised manpower, and equipment within the state's hazardous materials (hazmat) response system, disaster management experts said.The long-winded series of events began around 5pm on Tuesday evening, when a tanker carrying nearly 21,000kg of highly flammable propylene gas overturned near the Adoshi tunnel.Bhalchandra Chavan, director of the state disaster management department, told TOI, ""We could not operate at the site as we did not have the capabilities and trained personnel to operate in such an environment. We were totally dependent on private agencies that eventually helped us. To tackle such emergencies, we will take the necessary steps and train our personnel.""A senior official from state disaster management added, ""As multiple agencies were on board and since the gas was highly inflammable, we took extra precautions to ensure the safety of commuters and personnel involved in the operation. This took extra time since the operation was in the ghat section and there was huge traffic congestion.So, it hampered the operation and thereby consumed extra time.""Despite the gravity of the situation, specialised response teams did not reach the site for several hours. Officials confirmed that the operation eventually stretched to over 32 hours not because of the complexity alone, but due to delays in mobilising trained hazmat experts and appropriate equipment.Technical intervention was finally led by a private agency, Mec Elec Industrial Services, whose team reached the site only on Wednesday morning. By then, propylene continued to escape the tanker. ""This was not a conventional fuel spill. Propylene is a compressed, highly volatile gas. Any wrong move could have triggered a massive blast,"" said a senior disaster management official, pointing out that most state agencies lacked hands-on experience in such scenarios.ZN Gawade, technical director of Mec Elec Industrial Services (MEIS), Thane, a private agency which played a crucial role in the operation, told TOI that the situation on the ground was extremely volatile and critical.""All three top-mounted ball valves on the tanker were damaged in the rollover and were leaking. Liquid propylene was discharging from every connection, forcing authorities to stop traffic in both directions. Lower Explosive Limit readings were alarmingly high even 500m from the site, underscoring the severe explosion risk,"" he said.Working under life-threatening conditions, the response team managed to arrest two out of three leaks — one liquid and one vapour valve. The third valve, however, posed a formidable challenge. Bent sharply during impact, its handle jammed against the weld cap, making operation impossible while liquid propylene continued to escape, officials said.Gawade reached the site on Wednesday morning, travelling against traffic flow in a police-escorted ambulance. After a detailed technical assessment, the team opted for a high-risk decanting strategy — transferring the tanker's contents through the single operable vapour valve into multiple empty propylene tankers.""The objective was to reduce the liquid level inside the damaged tanker until the leaking valve began releasing vapour instead of liquid, significantly lowering the hazard,"" he said.""By around 4.30pm, specialised transfer hoses were connected and liquid transfer was initiated using pressure differential, with receiving tankers carefully depressurised. The process was repeated thrice, each transfer conducted with extreme caution due to loosened valves and mechanical instability,"" said Madhav Divekar, director of MEIS.Once the leaking valve began venting vapour — indicating the liquid level dropped below roughly 50% — authorities prepared for the next critical phase: lifting the overturned tanker. The operation was carried out with extensive multi-agency support, including the police, NDRF, fire brigade, and other state and local agencies. Four cranes and multiple fire tenders were deployed, and the plan was rehearsed in detail before execution, Divekar said.""As anticipated, the leak briefly intensified when residual liquid contacted the damaged valve via the dip pipe. The response team swiftly arrested the final leak, preventing escalation at a critical moment. At around 1.30am on Thursday, the tanker was escorted through the ghat section under strict safety supervision,"" he said.""Despite still containing a significant quantity of propylene, another delicate operation was undertaken, partially opening the bent liquid valve to decant additional product into a fourth tanker. The tanker was finally transported to the Khalapur tanker testing station, reaching the facility at around 5am. By then, the technical team worked continuously for almost 36 hours, navigating one of the most complex and hazardous compressed-gas response operations witnessed on an Indian highway in recent years,"" Divekar added.India has thousands of hazmat tankers moving daily. Therefore, it is essential to have designated routes for transportation of ‘dangerous goods' across highways to prevent incidents like this","The long-winded series of events began around 5pm on Tuesday evening, when a tanker carrying nearly 21,000kg of highly flammable propylene gas overturned near the Adoshi tunnel.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Delay in polls leaves Hyderabad’s elite 140-year-old club in state of flux,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/delay-in-polls-leaves-hyderabads-elite-140-year-old-club-in-state-of-flux/articleshow/128020027.cms,"Hyderabad's prestigious Nizam Club is embroiled in a power struggle as elections are delayed by over four months, splitting its influential membership

EGM adjourned

Land gifted by 6th Nizam





HYDERABAD: The city’s prestigious Nizam Club has landed itself in a bitter power struggle after the club elections were pushed back by more than four months — only the second such delay in its 140-year history.And apart from leading to administrative concerns, the impasse has also split its influential membership, which includes politicians, senior bureaucrats, business leaders, and members of the erstwhile royal family.The crisis began after an extraordinary general meeting (EGM), convened in June, 2025 — to vote on key governance reforms -was abruptly adjourned amid chaos. A section of members alleged procedural violations claiming that honorary secretary Amarendar Reddy continued to function in the post for almost four months after his tenure officially ended on Sept 24, 2025.“The EGM was called to vote on crucial reforms such as limiting leadership positions to four years, barring former presidents from contesting lower posts etc,” said Prasad Reddy, a businessman and member for over 43 years.“With nearly 600 members present, a secret ballot was the only practical option. However, the secretary and his supporters insisted on a show of hands. Amid the ruckus, the meeting was adjourned and the resolutions were never put to vote.”Following the aborted EGM, some members approached the courts, alleging procedural lapses. They further claimed that despite the legal challenge and the expiry of his tenure, Amarendar Reddy continued to discharge the duties.The charge was vehemently refuted by the honourary secretary who maintained that his actions were in accordance with the club’s by-laws. “Elections are held every alternate year. Since elections are still due, I am permitted to function on an election-to-election basis. This is a procedural delay, not an intentional act,” Amarendar Reddy told TOI .This opponents, however, cited a recent civil court order that stated that the bylaws does not allow the outgoing secretary to continue if the elections are not conducted. “In the present case, since terms of the general secretary are expired and no elections are conducted and no general secretary is elected, as per the Rule 26 the joint secretary is the authorised person to represent the Club,” the court order stated.Members alleged that this issue has affected the club’s routine functioning. “He continued to take administrative decisions, sign cheques, and reject member-requisitioned meetings even after his tenure ended,” alleged Zafar Javeed, the club’s current president adding that a requisition signed by over 200 members seeking another EGM was rejected without adequate justification. “Members followed due process. Rejecting the request only deepened the impasse. Vendors have stopped supplies, and banks temporarily restricted transactions due to the absence of updated authorised signatories.”Founded in 1884, the Nizam Club was built on land gifted by Mehboob Ali Pasha, the sixth Nizam of Hyderabad, to serve as a recreational space for the city’s elite. Over the decades, apart from prominent public figures, it has counted among its members prime ministers to the Nizam and their descendants, senior IAS and IPS officers inducted under special tenure-based categories, and corporate members, including public sector undertakings such as State Bank of India and NMDC. The club currently has over 6,200 members.Beyond governance issues, members point to a steady decline in infrastructure and facilities. ""Large sums are spent every year, but the results are disappointing,” said Ashfaq Ahmed, a businessman whose family has been associated with the club for over four decades.""Around Rs 14 crore was spent on a sports complex, yet it began leaking soon after. Ceilings are sagging, courts are poorly maintained, and even the menu hasn’t been updated in years. Many members, including eight from my own family, have stopped visiting altogether. We need an election at the earliest to save this institution,” Ahmed added."," Hyderabad's prestigious Nizam Club is embroiled in a power struggle as elections are delayed by over four months.
