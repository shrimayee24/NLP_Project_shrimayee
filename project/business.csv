"20cr Indians lead 'inactive' lives, urban girls worst-hit, says study",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/20cr-indians-lead-inactive-lives-urban-girls-worst-hit-says-study/articleshow/113046764.cms,"A first of its kind national survey on sports & physical activity reveals that over 20 crore Indians are ""inactive"" based on international norms, & that girls in cities are most inactive.Inactivity levels are based on WHO recommendations that adults should engage in at least 150mins of activity per week to mitigate health risks, anxiety and depression.Children and adolescents must be active 60 minutes per day - a number that is way off the charts for a society where parents and teachers constantly tell children that they should study first, play after.""One of the biggest myths we need to debunk is that physical activity comes in the way of academics when actually it complements and enhances academic success,"" says Swetha Totapally, regional director for Dalberg Advisors, Asia Pacific, which conducted the survey along with Sports and Society Accelerator, a non-profit organisation. ""Physical activity and sport leads to physiological changes, mood regulation, stamina and cognitive improvements - which translates into individual outcomes."" The survey suggests that a fully active India by 2047 can boost GDP by over Rs 15 trillion annually.We have to distinguish between sports and physical activity, says Desh Gaurav Sekhri, co-founder of Sports and Society Accelerator. ""In India, we have confused physical activity with sport - so the words that come to mind are medals, competition and excellence rather than health, community, productivity.""Among the most disturbing findings is gender gap in physical activity. Girls in cities are the worst hit because of the low proximity to public spaces like parks and maidans, as well as abiding fear over safety. Three-quarters of active time for the average Indian woman is consumed by household chores and caregiving to children and elders.Also, urban inactivity rates are almost twice as high compared to rural areas. There is a pressing need to integrate physical activity into schools for 67% of the students surveyed said their school did not have sports equipment, while 21% said their school did not have a playground.The survey - conducted in Maharashtra, UP, Odisha and Tamil Nadu - relied on focus group discussions with parents, blue collar workers, physical education teachers and students.","A first of its kind national survey on sports & physical activity reveals that over 20 crore Indians are ""inactive"" based on international norms, & that girls in cities are most inactive.

AHMEDABAD: When Dr Deepak Vyas and Dr Samisth Vyas appeared for the NEET-PG examination earlier this year, they became one of the rare father-son duo who wrote this tough exam together in the same year, on the basis of which admission in PG medical courses is granted in the country.Interestingly, Dr Samisth, who completed his MBBS in 2023 and is currently doing his internship, scored more than his father, who has 28 years of experience! ""Son proved to be better than the father.I had clinical experience, but my son scored better,"" said 51-year-old Dr Vyas.The duo declined to share their scores, saying that the first attempt was more for experience and that Dr Samisth would take the exam again.""When Samisth started preparing for his NEET-PG exams, I decided to give it a shot. When I passed MBBS in 1996, conditions were such that I had to start working and I could not pursue specialisation. Hence, I took it as a challenge to write the NEET-PG exam to test my knowledge, way of learning and format,"" says Dr Deepak Vyas.""I wanted to give company and competition to my son, who passed from GMERS Gandhinagar. We studied together where I guided him in practical aspects, while he would help me with the theoretical aspects from his syllabus.""Dr Vyas said when he last appeared for the MBBS exam 28 years ago, the format was descriptive, and the MCQ format in which NEET-PG is conducted was unthinkable. ""I am from the pen and paper era when MBBS marks were considered for PG admission. Writing the exam on the computer in multiple choice questions (MCQ) format was a new experience,"" added Dr Vyas, a medical counsellor with Apollo Hospitals.The duo said that the examination was a good way to prepare for what comes next – Samisth, who wishes to pursue MD (medicine), will appear next year with better preparation to get admission in his desired field. So, the duo did not fret much about the exam or rank this year as the purpose was not to secure a seat. They had different centres for the exam, they added.The outcome was a win-win. The duo said that it was the spirit of competition that kept them going. ""The result was not the goal – it was the journey, the time spent together and the sense of achievement that we will cherish,"" said Samisth.","Dr Deepak Vyas and his son Samisth appeared for the NEET-PG examination earlier this year.

I understand that any infringements would attract strict action against me'.While the honour code has been in existence at the university for some time, the changes this year have raised some eyebrows on the campus.The university has been in the news for all the wrong reasons, starting with the the unofficial screening of a banned BBC movie last Jan, to the recent ban on a student collective, Progressive Students' Forum (PSF), which the institute claimed was 'unauthorised' and 'illegal'. PSF has been active on the campus for 12 years.With the signing of the new Memorandum of Agreement (MoA) early this year, the university, known for its contribution towards social work education, was brought under the ambit of the union ministry of education. The university was earlier managed by the Tata Trusts, which had its nominee as chairperson of the board. With the new MoA, the institute is now governed by the TISS Society, chaired by the union education minister. This was after the Central govt's decision to bring all institutions that receive over 50% grants from the Centre under its jurisdiction. TISS was one of them.In April this year, Ramadas K S, the former general secretary of PSF, was suspended for two years for participating in 'unlawful' and 'anti-national' activities.While his suspension matter is in the court, a TISS student said the revision in the honour code this year could be following this development. ""How can an institute's honour code precede constitutional rights?"" asked the student, adding the institute has been making these norms stringent every year. He said the validity of this code should be challenged too. This year's code mentioned that 'the undertaking is legally binding'. It also mentioned that violation of the code could lead even to expulsion.Speaking about the honour code, Medha Patkar, a respected alumna of TISS, said bringing students under such bondage will not resolve the conflict between the administration and students' community but will only worsen the situation.""Students and alumni should appeal to the administration for more dialogue. The code that students have been asked to sign is also against the basic constitutional rights. TISS alumni are known for their work in peace and non-violent work in society.

The aim is to ink the contract for the 22 single-seat jets and four twin-seat trainers within this fiscal,"" a source told TOI.The main DAC takeaways were the grant of the ""acceptance of necessity (AoN)"" to the Rs 72,000 crore project to construct seven frigates, with advanced stealth features as well as the latest weapons and sensors, and the Rs 57,000 crore programme for the future ready combat vehicles (FRCVs) or tanks.The Army wants to induct the 1,770 FRCVs, with superior mobility and all-terrain ability, multilayered protection and real-time situational awareness, precision and lethal firepower, from 2030 onwards.The induction will be done in three phases, with 590 tanks in the first lot, to progressively replace the existing fleet of 2,400 Russian-origin T-72 tanks. Each phase will see induction of newer technologies to ensure the highest level of survivability, lethality and agility, as was earlier reported by TOI.The first of the seven new frigates, with a displacement of around 7,000-tonne, will also roll out only by 2031-32 at the earliest under Project-17B. ""It will take three years to ink the contract after the bidding and selection process,"" another source said.The Navy, incidentally, is slated to get seven 6,670-tonne Nilgiri-class stealth frigates already being constructed under the Rs 45,000 crore Project-17A - four at Mazagon Docks in Mumbai and three at GRSE in Kolkata - in the 2024-26 time frame. Of the total cost of AoNs accorded on Tuesday, 99% were from domestic sources under the Buy (Indian) and Buy (Indian, indigenously designed developed and manufactured) categories, the MoD said.They include procurement of air defence fire control radars, which will detect and track aerial targets and then provide a firing solution, ""forward repair team (tracked)"" vehicles, which have suitable cross-country mobility for carrying out in-situ repairs during mechanized operations by tanks and infantry combat vehicles, for the Army.The Coast Guard, in turn, will get additional Dornier-228 aircraft as well as next-generation fast patrol vessels and offshore patrol vessels with advanced technologies for enhanced long-range operations.","The Defence Acquisitions Council (DAC) also approved four ""amendments"" to the over Rs 50,000-crore deal for 26 Rafale-Marine fighters currently being negotiated with France.

Country faces surge in immigration scams amidst stricter visa regulations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/country-faces-surge-in-immigration-scams-amidst-stricter-visa-regulations/articleshow/113039446.cms,"India has experienced a notable increase in immigration scams over recent years, with fraudulent agents exploiting individuals seeking to study, work, or migrate abroad. These scams have caused substantial financial and emotional distress for many victims and tarnished India’s reputation as a reliable source of skilled labor.According to the Delhi Police, the IGI Airport Police have apprehended 108 fraudulent agents in the last six months—a sharp rise from the 51 arrests made during the same period last year.This surge in criminal activity has prompted foreign governments to impose stricter visa regulations and heightened scrutiny of Indian applicants.Notable visa fraud casesHealthyway visa fraud case (2011): In Chandigarh, Healthyway Immigration was accused of visa fraud after promising guaranteed visas to Canada, the US, and Australia. Despite high fees and quick processing assurances, many victims received fake or unprocessed visas. The company’s owner, Amit Kakkar, was arrested following an investigation.Chandigarh’s fake visa racket (2018): A major scandal involved a group of travel agents in Chandigarh issuing fake visas and forging documents for individuals aiming to migrate to Canada, the US, and Australia. The high fees charged for rapid processing left many victims facing detention or entry denial.Kerala visa scandal (2023): A network of travel agents in Kerala was discovered issuing fake visas for individuals intending to migrate to countries like Australia and the UK. The agents forged documents and charged exorbitant fees, leading to numerous complaints and several arrests.Tips to avoid visa fraudTo protect yourself from such scams, start by researching the agency, checking reviews, certifications, and seeking accreditation from recognized regulatory bodies. Be cautious of agencies that guarantee visas or promise expedited processing for extra fees, as legitimate consultants cannot make such guarantees. Ensure the consultant or agency is registered with relevant immigration authorities, and consult official bodies like the Ministry of External Affairs for verification.Carefully review all documents and agreements for hidden fees or suspicious terms. Be skeptical of unusually high fees, especially if paid upfront, and compare with other reputable agencies.Use official contact methods to reach immigration agencies and avoid unsolicited emails or messages. Report any suspicious activity to local authorities or the Ministry of External Affairs.","According to the Delhi Police, the IGI Airport Police have apprehended 108 fraudulent agents in the last six months.

"From ineligible beneficiaries to poor recovery of funds, CAG detects lapses in PM-KISAN in Assam",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/from-ineligible-beneficiaries-to-poor-recovery-of-funds-cag-detects-lapses-in-pm-kisan-in-assam/articleshow/113037488.cms,"GUWAHATI: Implementation of the Centre's flagship 'Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi' (PM-KISAN) scheme in Assam has been plagued by problems, ranging from 35 per cent of the applicants being found ineligible to the recovery of a mere 0.24 per cent of funds released to these non-entitled beneficiaries , as detected by the Comptroller and Auditor General ( CAG ).A performance audit of the scheme from December 2018 to March 2021 found that out of the 41,87,023 applications from the state, 10,66,593 (25 per cent) were rejected by PM-KISAN portal and Public Financial Management System.Subsequently, the state government declared that 11,72,685 (37 per cent) out of the 31,20,430 beneficiaries were ineligible through an inquiry conducted from May-July 2020 across the state.A mere 0.24 per cent of the funds released to these ineligible beneficiaries were received back till October 2021, which was not refunded to the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, the CAG report, tabled in the state assembly recently, said.The CAG report also pointed out that the inquiry initiated in May 2020 on order of the chief minister, following complaints from different quarters regarding anomalies in the beneficiaries list, had found 15,59,286 ineligible names during verification across the state from May to July 2020.Among the different categories of ineligible beneficiaries were non-farmer beneficiaries, government employees and pensioners, and multiple entries.As per the verification report, 11,31,152 (72.54 per cent) of over 15 lakh ineligible beneficiaries were found to be untraceable.When the auditors pointed to the difference in the figure of ineligible beneficiaries furnished by the state nodal officer (SNO) (11,72,685) and the one mentioned in the report of verification (15,59,286), the state government said that ""another verification was being conducted and as such, the figure was dynamic"".The audit, carried out in 10 districts selected based on saturation level of beneficiaries, found lack of monitoring and non-adherence to guidelines for the implementation of the scheme at various stages.In addition to the 10 districts, Barpeta was also selected considering the largest number of ineligible beneficiaries in the state.Twenty-two blocks from the selected 11 districts, with three villages in each block, were taken for the audit, covering 15 beneficiaries' records (totalling 990) each from the selected villages.The performance audit revealed that the state government did not maintain a database of landholding farmer families to identify potential beneficiaries.Emphasis was given to uploading a large number of beneficiaries' data within a short period of time instead of ensuring the eligibility of the beneficiaries as per provisions of the scheme.Lack of monitoring by supervisory officers also adversely affected implementation of the scheme, the audit report said.It also maintained that the audit exercise was ""adversely affected due to lack of cooperation towards furnishing records/information by the Director of Agriculture"".Analysis of SNO database by the audit detected that fake registration numbers were created by zeros at the beginning of the bank account numbers, as a result of which multiple benefits were credited to the same bank account against multiple registrations.The audit found 3,577 such registrations in 16 out of 33 districts against which Rs 3.01 crore was released, the report added.It also noticed that multiple registrations were done using the same bank account in respect of 3,104 beneficiaries in 10 districts, though no benefits were released to these beneficiaries.The audit also found that funds were released to beneficiaries with names containing jumbled letters or special characters.Scrutiny of records revealed that out of Rs 2.18 crore received towards administrative expenses, the SNO submitted utilisation certificate (UC) of only Rs 77 lakh to the Government of India, with the UCs for the remaining not furnished till October 2021.The exercise of physical verification of beneficiaries by the supervisory officers was not given the due importance in the state, which not only violated provisions of the operational guidelines but also pointed towards ineffective monitoring and supervision of implementation of the scheme in the state, the CAG report said.The state government, which accepting the audit observations, said in February 2022 that 100 per cent re-verification is being conducted since June 2021 through revenue officials under the supervision of the deputy commissioners and the Principal Secretary of the Sixth Schedule areas, the report added.","A performance audit of the scheme from December 2018 to March 2021 found that out of the 41,87,023 applications from the state, 10,66,593 (25

Aparajita Bill

?

President approval

Amid ongoing widespread protest across the nation for the rape and murder of a doctor in Kolkata, the West Bengal Assembly on Tuesday passed the Aparajita Woman and Child Bill (West Bengal Criminal Laws and Amendment) Bill 2024.The bill passed by the Mamata Banerjee government, proposes stringent punishments, including the death penalty, for convicted rapists, especially in cases where the crime results in the victim’s death or leaves them in a vegetative state.The bill seeks to amend key sections of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) 2023, recently introduced criminal law by the central government.Those convicted of severe crimes could face death penalty or life imprisonment without possibility of parole. It also includes provisions for harsher sentences for repeat offenders, who could be sentenced to life imprisonment or even death.The bill provides quicker investigations, with a new three-week deadline for cases to be completed, a significant reduction from the current two-month period. However, an extension of up to 15 days could be granted under specific conditions.Additionally, the bill aims to establish a special task force called the ""Aparajita Task Force"" at the district level, led by a deputy superintendent of police. This task force would focus on handling these serious cases with the necessary resources and expertise to reduce the trauma for victims and their families.Special courts will also be set up to try these cases, and publishing any details about court proceedings without permission could result in imprisonment for up to five years, along with a fine. The bill, which will be introduced by State Law Minister Moloy Ghatak, is expected to be discussed in the state assembly soon.Criminal law in India falls under the concurrent list, meaning both state and central governments can legislate on the subject. However, for the Aparajita bill to be enacted, it must receive the President's approval.","The bill seeks to amend key sections of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) 2023.

Increasing our disposal-to-filing ratio hinges on attracting skilled personnel. At district level, vacancies in judicial personnel stand at 28% and of non-judicial staff at 27%.

'9th fail leading Bihar's development': Prashant Kishor targets Tejashwi Yadav over educational qualifications,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/9th-fail-leading-bihars-development-prashant-kishor-targets-tejashwi-yadav-over-educational-qualifications/articleshow/113007774.cms,"NEW DELHI: Jan Suraaj chief Prashant Kishor attacked Bihar's deputy chief minister Tejashwi Yadav 's ability to lead the state's development. Kishor didn't mince words as he questioned Yadav's educational qualifications , pointing out that he failed to clear the 10grade despite his privileged background.Speaking at a gathering in Bhojpur, Bihar, Kishor said, ""If someone could not get educated because of lack of resources, it is understood.But if someone's parents are chief minister and he could not pass 10th class, then this shows their approach towards education.""Kishor further criticised Yadav's educational background and highlighted the irony, saying, ""A 9th fail is showing the way to Bihar's development. He (Tejashwi Yadav) doesn't know the difference between GDP and GDP growth and he will tell how Bihar will improve?""Kishor challenged Yadav's credentials, arguing that his only claim to leadership is being the son of former chief minister Lalu Yadav and a leader in RJD due to family ties . He highlighted that Yadav must work hard and prove himself through actions to build a reputation beyond his family name.Kishor also questioned Yadav's upcoming state tour, set to begin on September 10, urging him to connect with constituents on foot instead of relying on a convoy of vehicles and staged photo opportunities.He criticised Yadav's promises of government jobs as misleading, pointing out that the existing 23 lakh government employees in Bihar only account for 1.97 per cent of the population, and even if Yadav delivers on his promises, 98 per cent of the people would remain unaffected.Kishor also challenged Yadav to speak about socialism for five minutes without reading from a paper, implying that Yadav lacks the necessary understanding to discuss such concepts.Speaking on the caste census, Kishor supported its implementation but criticised the current political discourse surrounding it as a tool for political gain. He suggested that parties genuinely concerned about the issue should first implement the census in states where they hold power and provide economic benefits to the respective communities, including the Congress party in the states they govern.","Jan Suraaj chief Prashant Kishor attacked Bihar's deputy chief minister Tejashwi Yadav's ability to lead the state's development.

Who is Maya Neelakantan?

There are two major musical moments in Season 4 of Stranger Things. The first is, of course, Kate Bush’s ""Running Up That Hill,"" and the second is Metallica ’s "" Master of Puppets ,"" which Eddie Munson plays in the Upside Down, a scene that has been labeled ""the most metal scene of all time."" Now, Joseph Quinn (who plays Eddie Munson) has some competition, and she’s even more metal.One of the standout performers at America’s Got Talent was 10-year-old Maya Neelakantan whose Master of Puppets cover wowed every judge and even Metallica who shared her performance on Facebook.She wrote on YouTube: ""Thank you so much! It was such an honor that Metallica trusted me that I’ll make them proud and I was able to play this iconic Metallica song for the first time ever on AGT! And the AGT crew are amazing in creating such an incredible unforgettable experience. Metallica was the reason I started playing guitar since 6 years old and now it feels like a full circle that I got to play Metallica for my 2nd ever biggest stage performance. That's what made this day most special for me! Thank you all for the love and support. It means a lot!""Maya advanced to the quarterfinals of America’s Got Talent, where she delivered a powerful rendition of Metallica's Master of Puppets, using a Gibson Flying V metallic silver guitar. Despite her electrifying performance, she did not advance to the semifinals. However, her journey on AGT significantly boosted her profile, earning her fans worldwide, including notable musicians like Gary Holt of Exodus and Slayer, who attended her audition to show his support.Here’s what you ought to know about the guitar prodigy :Maya Neelakantan, born on May 4, 2013, in Chennai, India, is a young guitar prodigy renowned for her unique fusion of heavy metal and Carnatic music . Hailing from MRC Nagar, Raja Annamalai Puram in Chennai, Maya has captivated audiences worldwide with her extraordinary talent and innovative musical style. Her journey began at the tender age of six when she picked up the guitar under the influence of her father, who, though not a professional musician, had a passion for playing riffs from iconic metal bands like Metallica and Slayer. This early exposure to rock music sparked Maya's interest, and soon she was learning to play her first song, ""For Whom The Bell Tolls"" by Metallica.Maya's multicultural background has played a significant role in shaping her musical identity. Her father, an IT company owner with a background in astrophysics, and her mother, Lorina, an Australian entrepreneur, met in Australia. Maya’s diverse heritage and her family's musical inclinations inspired her to explore various genres, blending them seamlessly in her performances. At nine, she began formal training in Carnatic music with Prasanna Ramaswamy, a renowned Tamil guitarist based in New York. Prasanna's mentorship helped Maya develop a profound understanding of Carnatic music, which she skillfully integrates with her heavy metal renditions.Maya’s talent soon caught the attention of the global music community. In 2022, her cover of ""7empest"" by the Grammy-winning rock band Tool went viral on her YouTube channel, which her father had set up to showcase her skills. This performance impressed Adam Jones, Tool's guitarist, who became an admirer of her work. Jones even gifted Maya a customized Gibson Adam Jones Les Paul guitar, marking a significant milestone in her burgeoning career.In 2024, Maya's exceptional abilities led her to the stage of America's Got Talent (AGT), where she auditioned for the show's 19th season. Her performance was broadcast in June 2024, but the actual audition took place two months earlier when she was just ten years old. Dressed in traditional Indian attire, Maya wowed the audience and judges with a mesmerizing blend of a Carnatic devotional intro and a heavy metal rendition of ""Last Resort"" by Papa Roach. This unique fusion not only earned her a standing ovation but also garnered praise from all the AGT judges. Simon Cowell, known for his critical eye, hailed her as a ""rock goddess,"" while Howie Mandel predicted that her performance would go viral.Beyond her television appearances, Maya has continued to develop her musical style, drawing on her dual love for heavy metal and Carnatic music. She credits her grandmother for introducing her to Carnatic music at the age of two, a genre that has remained close to her heart even as she explored the world of metal. Maya's ambition to merge these two seemingly disparate styles has driven her to create a unique sound that reflects her diverse influences and her desire to push musical boundaries.","Maya Neelakantan is a young guitar prodigy renowned for her unique fusion of heavy metal and Carnatic music.

over 2,100 students to embrace ultra-short sleep

Social media reactions

Daisuke Hori , a 40-year-old entrepreneur from Hyogo Prefecture in western Japan , has been sleeping just 30 minutes each day for the past 12 years in a bid to ""double"" his life. By drastically reducing his sleep, Hori claims to have improved his work efficiency and overall productivity, stating that he never feels tired.Hori, who has a passion for music, painting, and mechanical design, began cutting back on sleep to gain more active hours in his day.Over time, he has successfully trained his brain and body to function normally on just 30 to 45 minutes of rest. “As long as you do sports or drink coffee an hour before eating, you can stave off drowsiness,” he explained, as quoted by the South China Morning Post.Hori’s daily routine includes work and gym sessions, which he fits into his extended waking hours. On one occasion, he slept for just 26 minutes but woke up feeling refreshed and full of energy.Medical professionals caution that ultra-short sleep is not suitable for everyone and can have serious side effects. “Adults are recommended to get seven to nine hours of sleep each day. Sleep is an important period for the body and brain to recover and repair,” said Guo Fei, a neurologist at Huazhong University of Science and Technology Xiehe Shenzhen Hospital, as quoted by the South China Morning Post. Guo warned that chronicsleep deprivation can lead to memory decline, weakened immunity, mood disorders, and increased risks of cardiovascular diseases.Hori’s lifestyle was featured on Japan’s Yomiuri TV show ""Will You Go With Me?"" which followed him for three days.In 2016, Hori founded the Japan Short Sleepers Training Association , where he offers classes on sleep and health. He argues that people who need sustained focus, such as doctors and firefighters, benefit more from high-quality sleep rather than long sleep periods. To date, Hori claims to have taught over 2,100 students to become ultra-short sleepers.One of his students shared with Yomiuri TV that she successfully reduced her sleep from eight hours to just 90 minutes per night after training with Hori. She has maintained this routine for four years while keeping her skin and mental health in excellent condition.Hori’s extreme sleep regimen has sparked heated discussions on social media. While some praise him as a master of time management and express interest in learning how to sleep less, others warn of potential health risks. “This is overdrawing one’s life in advance! Even if the brain can stay awake, the heart won’t be able to handle it,” one comment reads.Apart from Hori, Prahlad Jani, an Indian yogi, has also claimed to have lived without food and water since 1940 and reportedly died at the age of 90 in 2020.","Daisuke Hori, a 40-year-old entrepreneur from Hyogo Prefecture in western Japan, has been sleeping just 30 minutes each day for the past 12 years.

The second round of admissions to NEET-based degree programme seats in Goa will take place from Sep 16 to 18, where 100 seats in two ayurveda institutes will be up for grabs. Admissions to the ayurveda degree programmes could not take place in the first round of admissions as they had to be held as per the central body’s directives governing this programme.Goa has two institutes offering the Bachelor in Ayurveda Medicine and Surgery (BAMS) programme, a private one at Shiroda and the All India Institute of Ayurveda (AIIA) at Dhargalim, Pernem.At the AIIA, 50% seats are reserved for Goan students.The admission to NEET-based courses was delayed this year due to the row over NEET nationally. After the fiasco, the first round of admissions was held only last month, where all medical and dental programme degree seats were filled in Goa, as there is only one institute each offering the courses.Besides the ayurveda degree programme, there are some seats left vacant in the nursing and five paramedical programmes (offered at Goa Medical College), which will also be on offer during the second round of admissions.Officials at the directorate of technical education ( DTE ) said that there will be further rounds for admissions held for NEET-based courses in Oct if seats are still available.Meanwhile, the next round of admissions for engineering diploma programme seats will be held on Sep 13 and for engineering degree programme seats on Sep 14.During this round of admissions too, the DTE will allow students who have not answered NEET to come on the spot and seek admissions to any available engineering programme seat.On the completion of the first round of admissions of over 1,500 seats in the five engineering colleges in Goa, around 400 seats were left vacant. Following this, DTE decided to allow students who had not appeared for the joint entrance examination ( JEE ) to apply for the vacant seats in view of the large number of vacancies.Students can seek admissions as long as they meet all other criteria for admissions set by the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), such as a minimum score of 45% in physics-chemistry-mathematics (PCM) at their Class XII board exams for general students, and 40% for those in reserved categories.","The admission to NEET-based courses was delayed this year due to the row over NEET nationally.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.",Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

Lawrence Bishnoi gang behind AP Dhillon's Vancouver house firing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/lawrence-bishnoi-gang-behind-ap-dhillons-vancouver-house-firing/articleshow/113003612.cms,"AP Dhillon's Canada Residence Attacked; Goldy Brar's Role Suspected | Watch Video

NEW DELHI: The Lawrence Bishnoi gang has claimed responsibility for allegedly firing shots outside the residence of popular Punjabi singer AP Dhillon in Vancouver , Canada. The incident came to light on Sunday. According to reports, multiple gunshots were fired outside Dhillon's house, with a circulating point of view (POV) video depicting a man firing with an automatic pistol outside the house during the night.Dhillon, a prominent figure in the Punjabi music industry, resides on Victoria Island in British Columbia.In a social media post, Bishnoi's right-hand man, gangster Rohit Godara, wrote, ""Greetings to all brothers. On the night of Sept 1, we executed shootings at two locations in Canada-Victoria Island and Woodbridge, Toronto. I, Rohit Godara (Lawrence Bishnoi Group), claim responsibility for this act.""The post further reads: ""The house on Victoria Island belongs to AP Dhillon. Salman Khan is featured in your songs, and you flaunt your actions. The underworld life you emulate is the life we live. Stay in your place, or you will meet a dog's death.""The incident occurred shortly after Dhillon's latest music video release, ""Old Money"", which features Salman Khan. The intelligence agencies are investigating if this was the trigger for the shooting , as is evident from Godara's message.The incident in Canada bears a striking similarity to a previous shooting that took place outside Khan's residence at Galaxy Apartment in Mumbai's Bandra on April 14 this year. The investigation into that shooting revealed connections to the notorious Bishnoi gang, prompting the Mumbai police to invoke Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) against all the individuals involved.The Lawrence Bishnoi gang has been implicated in several high-profile cases in the last year. His key associate, Godara, orchestrated the assassination of Karni Sena chief Sukhdev Gogamedi in Rajasthan last year. He has also been issuing threats to Delhi's business community.Godara was last found shuttling between Portugal and Azerbaijan but is suspected to have escaped to the US through the donkey route. Interpol had issued a red corner notice against Godara in Dec last year following a request from Indian law enforcement agencies.Associated with the Bishnoi and Goldy Brar syndicate for a few years, Godara fled the country in June 2022 from Delhi. ""On June 13, 2022, Godara is learnt to have fled from Delhi to Dubai on a forged passport issued in the name of one 'Pawan Kumar',"" said an official.Originally from Bikaner, Godara turned to crime in 2010 and is wanted in at least 32 serious cases.","Lawrence Bishnoi gang claims responsibility for allegedly firing shots outside the residence of popular Punjabi singer AP Dhillon in Vancouver, Canada.

The $37 Billion Mystery: Russian Firm Banknota LLC Disappears After Posting Record Profits,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/the-37-billion-mystery-russian-firm-vanishes-after-posting-record-profit/articleshow/112999287.cms,"A shadowy enterprise in Russia, purported to have generated astonishing profits that were only outdone by the nation's leading energy firms, has seemingly vanished without a trace. The focus of this investigation is a company known as Banknota LLC , scrutinized by the Russian-language media outlet RTVI, with additional coverage from independent Russian sources, a Newsweek report said.In a piece titled ""The Most Profitable Company in Russia You've Never Heard Of,"" RTVI revealed that it made an ""unexpected discovery"" in June, a month when Russian companies disclose their earnings for the preceding year. RTVI reported that Banknota raked in $37.1 billion in profits last year before it vanished. Financial records indicated that the company reported revenues of 3.7 trillion rubles (approximately $40.4 billion) and net profit 34 trillion rubles (around $37.1 billion) in the previous year, eclipsing all competitors except for state-owned energy corporations Rosneft and Gazprom.Although Banknota maintained a website that is no longer accessible, it remains archived on the Wayback Machine. The site claimed the firm specialized in mortgage lending, auto loans, and interest-bearing business loans. However, RTVI highlighted that Banknota lacked a banking license. The Unified State Register of Legal Entities lists Dmitry Frolov, a Moscow local with prior petty theft convictions and labeled ""unreliable"" by Federal Tax, as the company's sole proprietor.According to RTVI, Banknota was established in June 2023 alongside four other firms, operating from locations that included a business center and a residential basement. However, there were no actual offices at these addresses, and current occupants had never heard of Frolov or his enterprises.Experts consulted by RTVI expressed skepticism, noting that such substantial profits could not realistically be generated from mortgages and auto loans. They suggested that the operations of brokers, who act as intermediaries between banks and borrowers, do not necessitate a license. Additionally, Banknota informed Russian tax authorities last December of a branch in Belarus, although no record of such a branch exists in Belarusian business registries. Experts speculated that the company might have diverted funds abroad prior to its disappearance, with one remarking that the financial figures presented in Banknota's statements ""cannot be taken seriously.""",Russian-language media outlet RTVI reported that Banknota LLC raked in $37.1 billion in profits last year.
