NEW DELHI: Breast, cervical and ovarian cancer cases have risen steadily in India over the past five years, with deaths also increasing, according to new government data tabled in Parliament — underscoring the growing burden of cancers that largely affect women and the urgency of early detection.Figures from the National Cancer Registry Programme show breast cancer cases rose from about 2.13 lakh in 2021 to nearly 2.4 lakh in 2025. Cervical cancer cases increased from around 77,000 to over 79,000, while ovarian cancer cases climbed from about 45,000 to nearly 49,500 over the same period.Deaths have followed a similar upward trend. Breast cancer deaths increased from about 91,700 in 2021 to over 1.03 lakh in 2025. Cervical cancer deaths rose from roughly 41,500 to nearly 42,800, and ovarian cancer deaths from about 27,600 to more than 30,000 in five years.Large states such as Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, West Bengal, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka reported the highest absolute numbers of breast and cervical cancer cases, while northeastern states including Assam, Mizoram and Manipur continued to show disproportionately high cervical cancer rates relative to population size.The data was shared by the Union health ministry in response to a Rajya Sabha question. Officials said the rise reflects both an increasing disease burden and improved detection through expanded screening.Oncologists said the figures point to gaps that still need urgent attention. Dr Pragya Shukla, head of clinical oncology at Delhi State Cancer Institute, said the data reinforces the need to accelerate screening, HPV vaccination, timely referral and affordable treatment, warning that gaps in awareness and early care continue to drive avoidable deaths.To address the trend, the Centre said it is strengthening cancer care under the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Non-Communicable Diseases. At present, 770 district NCD clinics, 364 district day-care cancer centres and over 6,400 NCD clinics at community health centres are operational nationwide, with 297 more district day-care cancer centres approved for 2025–26.Population-based screening for people aged 30 years and above is being scaled up for early detection of breast and cervical cancer. The ministry said 19 State Cancer Institutes, 20 Tertiary Cancer Care Centres and cancer facilities across 22 new AIIMS are also part of the expansion.","Figures from the National Cancer Registry Programme show breast cancer cases rose from about 2.13 lakh in 2021 to nearly 2.4 lakh in 2025.

Anil Ambani undertakes not to leave country pending CBI-ED probes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/anil-ambani-undertakes-not-to-leave-country-pending-cbi-ed-probes/articleshow/127918681.cms,"Anil Ambani

There’s LOC against Anil Ambani, court told

NEW DELHI: Industrialist Anil Ambani on Wednesday gave an undertaking to the Supreme Court through his lawyer that he would not flee India pending court-monitored CBI and ED probes into alleged siphoning of Rs 40,000 crore from loans availed of from banks.With petitioner EAS Sarma’s counsel Prashant Bhushan apprehending that given the spread and size of the fraud, the principal accused may leave the country, a bench of CJI Surya Kant, Justices Joymalya Bagchi and Vipul M Pancholi said, “We don’t want any such thing to happen.”When the bench told solicitor general Tushar Mehta, who was representing both CBI and ED, to take preventive steps to ensure that investigation into the alleged fraud was not impeded, Mehta said that there was a look out circular (LOC) against Ambani, indicating that any attempt to flee the country would be foiled at the airport.Ambani’s counsel Mukul Rohatgi said, “There are many LOCs against him. But in the last three years, two ADAG companies have paid back Rs 20,000 crore to the banks. If he was to flee the country, why would he repay such huge amounts?”When Rohatgi assured the SC that Ambani would not leave the country without prior permission of the court, Mehta cautioned Rohatgi and reminded him that despite similar undertaking given by him on behalf of another client, that person had fled the country.The bench recorded the SG’s assurance that “all preventive/remedial measures would be taken to ensure that the ongoing investigations are not impeded”.The bench took exception to CBI registering only one FIR on SBI’s complaint against ADAG and adding similar loan amount siphoning complaints from other banks and financial institutions to the SBI FIR.“Each loan taken is a separate agreement. The modus operandi may be similar but violation of each agreement is a separate offence. Why would CBI not register separate FIRs?” the bench asked. Mehta said CBI would examine this issue and register separate FIRs if needed.The bench also found it strange that CBI was awaiting sanctions to investigate bank officials who were in collusion with ADAG officials in the alleged defrauding of banks through siphoning of loan amounts. It directed CBI to investigate all such bank officials involved in the crime, ignoring any legal impediment on that score. The SC said it would continue to monitor the CBI and ED probes and asked the two agencies to file a fresh status report in four weeks.The petition, filed through advocate Pranav Sachdeva, alleged that ADAG companies — Reliance Communications , Reliance Infratel and Reliance Telecom — cumulatively received loans of Rs 31,850 crore from a consortium of public sector banks led by State Bank of India between 2013-17.SBI’s deputy GM Jyoti Kumar registered an FIR on Aug 21 alleging “conspiracy, cheating, criminal breach of trust and criminal misconduct by Reliance Communications, Anil Ambani and other individuals resulting in a loss of Rs 2,929 crore”, the petitioner said, adding that the FIR was based on the report of a forensic audit of financial transactions of the three ADAG companies for the period 2013-17, which was commissioned by SBI in 2019.The ED, in its affidavit, informed the SC that it has so far registered three PMLA FIRs (ECIRs) against ADAG companies, searched 46 premises, issued 305 summonses, attached 204 properties worth Rs 12,000 crore and arrested four persons. Under Fema, it has attached properties worth Rs 78 crore, it said.","Anil Ambani gave an undertaking to the Supreme Court through his lawyer that he would not flee India pending court-monitored CBI and ED probes into alleged siphoning of Rs 40,000 crore from loans availed of from banks.

IndiGo’s 5% Flight Cut Explained: Causes, Impact on Routes, and the Ripple Effects on Passengers

NEW DELHI: Two months after IndiGo ’s mass flight cancellation in the wake of non-compliance with flying time norms, Competition Commission of India (CCI) on Wednesday ordered a detailed probe into its alleged unfair business practices.It said the carrier enjoyed “a position of dominance” in the airline business, noting that it operated exclusively on 330 routes, had consistently had 60%-61% market share and a much larger fleet than its rival Air India.Bengaluru-based Kartikeya Rawal had moved CCI after his flight on Dec 5 last year was cancelled and alternative ones were available only at higher prices. He alleged the overcharging by IndiGo was “abuse of dominance”. The airline contested the claim, while arguing that CCI did not have jurisdiction in the case.“…IndiGo is a significant market player… (has) effective control over market capacity and supply-side conditions. The domestic passenger aviation market exhibits very high and increasing concentration, exhibiting leading firms possess the ability to operate independently of competitive forces, as the presence of effective rivals is materially constrained,” the regulator said in a 16-page order uploaded on its website.In 2025, IndiGo had 64% domestic market share, followed by Air India group with 27%, Akasa with 5.1%, and other smaller airlines the remaining 3.9%, according to DGCA data.“..IndiGo operates the largest fleet with over 400 aircraft, which is significantly higher than that of its nearest competitor, Air India, which operates a fleet of (about) 191 aircraft. Therefore, on the basis of substantial and sustained market share, wide network reach with exclusive operations on a significant number of city-pair routes, comparatively larger fleet and strong financial performance, the commission is of prima facie view that (IndiGo) enjoys a position of dominance in the relevant market,” CCI said.The order said “by cancelling thousands of flights constituting a significant portion of the scheduled capacity, IndiGo effectively withheld its service from the market, creating an artificial scarcity, limiting consumer access to air travel during peak demand. Such conduct by a dominant enterprise may be viewed as restricting the provision of services.”The order added passengers who had booked tickets were left with “no real choice but to accept last-minute cancellations. Further, passengers were left to seek alternatives, on their own, at significantly higher prices. Given IndiGo’s dominant position, consumers were effectively locked in and lacked viable alternatives which appears to be in violation of (rules).”Cancellation of flights and lack of alternatives for passengers seemed to be “prima facie causing an appreciable adverse effect on competition in India. Thus, the Commission is of the opinion that a prima facie case of contravention of provisions is made out in the present matter.”","The Competition Commission of India (CCI) has ordered a detailed probe into IndiGo's alleged unfair business practices.

SRINAGAR: Chief minister Omar Abdullah on Wednesday tabled the Jammu and Kashmir Jan Vishwas (Amendment of Provisions) Bill-2025 in the assembly, becoming the first non-BJP CM to introduce the legislation that seeks to amend certain enactments of the Union Territory of J&K for decriminalising a range of offences and rationalising sentences.Outside the assembly, Opposition PDP expressed strong displeasure over the introduction of the Bill, even though party members did not raise their voice earlier when the CM rose to table the bill in the House. “The INDIA bloc member (NC) has broken ranks,” PDP spokesman Najmu Saqib said.National Conference rejected the allegations strongly, with party spokesperson Imran Nabi Dar saying, “PDP is opposing a bill aimed at decriminalising minor crimes and reducing unnecessary jail time. Unfortunately, PDP is letting its political animosity toward the NC govt blind it to the greater common good.”CM Omar, who also holds the charge of law, justice and parliamentary affairs, also introduced another bill — J&K Eliminating Discrimination Against Persons Affected by Leprosy Bill-2026. It seeks to amend relevant enactments to eliminate discrimination against or denial of equal treatment to persons affected by leprosy, and to prevent their segregation and exclusion.BOX: Fresh migrant relief registration not needed after improved situation in Kashmir: OmarSanjay Khajuria | TNNJammu: J&K CM Omar Abdullah on Wednesday said fresh cases for registration under Kashmir migrant relief assistance are not being entertained at present in view of the improved law and order situation in the Valley.Replying to a question from NC member Mubarak Gul in the assembly, Omar saidc under the prevailing circumstances in the Kashmir, there is no justification for fresh registration of migrants at this stage. Answering a supplementary query, he said the proposal for enhancement of the existing migrant relief assistance, considering inflation and the rising cost of living, has been taken up with the Ministry of Home Affairs, which is the competent authority to take a final decision in the matter.Earlier, the CM stated that the comprehensive PM Return and Rehabilitation Package for Kashmiri Migrants was announced in 2009 with a financial outlay of Rs 1,618.40 crore.

Those using ITR 3 and 4, including bizmen, professionals, freelancers and those under presumptive taxation, will get extra month to file returns, with the deadline extended to Aug 31,

CBDT chairman Ravi Agrawal

tells TOI . Excerpts:

What will be your strategy to achieve the target?

What kind of red flags?

What about widening the tax base?

What is the volume of data and how do you handle and ensure security of this data?

What would be the deadline for filing tax for a certain category of taxpayers?

How many taxpayers have shifted to the new tax regime?

There was some adverse market reaction on STT on the first day. Has that settled down? Will it be reviewed?

■ The target for the next year is based on a nominal GDP growth of 10%, and above that is tax buoyancy (tax growth as a ratio of GDP expansion). The tax buoyancy that is being projected is reasonable. Therefore, we should not find any problem in achieving that target.We have ushered in a lot of initiatives to bring in trust, and taxpayers are responding to it. There is greater focus on promoting better compliance because that means more conversion of data into revenue. If you can do that, it helps widen the tax base and also deepen it.We will have a new Income Tax Act, which is simpler. The sentiment will be positive and that will help bring more clarity into the processes and trigger higher compliance. We will notify rules and forms in Feb. It will simplify processes in the sense that forms will be made smarter and aligned with tax returns or audit reports to take care of disconnects and discrepancies, if any. It will be easy to identify red flags.■ Red flags like incorrect claims or not incorporating certain income. We have data and we can tally that. Analytics will help. The process will be strengthened. All this will send a strong message to the taxpayer community that you need to be consistent.That process has been initiated, and people are responding to it.■ When you talk about widening, there is also an element of deepening. Deepening is when I ought to report X, but I have reported X by 2. In that case, the return should reflect higher income than what has been shown. Widening is to expand base. It is not just about people who file returns, but also those who have paid taxes (via TDS or TCS) but did not file returns.There is a third category too: where you have certain information and those people have neither made a tax payment nor filed returns. You need to move scientifically; deep analysis has to be done, and where data is mature, you can act. Our NUDGE exercise is a step in that direction.We have got a very satisfactory response. In the last two years, 1.1 crore people have either updated their returns or revised them, yielding additional revenue of Rs 8,800 crore. Of this, Rs 1,750 crore are cases where refund claims have been reduced. All this has been done in a very non-intrusive way and based on data available with us. Widening and deepening depend on TDS outreach and data sharing among departments.■ There are 650 crore data pieces of transactions that the department handles on a yearly basis. We are in favour of getting more data. The department is only using data on transactions that have been done. The data is 100% secure and there is a process.■ Right now, for ITR 1 to 4 and part of ITR 5 that is not audited, the due date is July 31. For ITR 1 and 2, we will retain July 31, and for ITR 3 and 4, we will shift it to August 31. We often get complaints about bunching. This is how you stagger compliance and make it easier. We will allow taxpayers to revise till March.■ In assessment year 2024-25 (FY24), it was 76%, and in AY 25-26 (FY25), 88% of taxpayers moved to the new tax regime.■ The market shows that. There is nothing as of now.","Those using ITR 3 and 4, including bizmen, professionals, freelancers, will get extra month to file returns, with the deadline extended to Aug 31.

NEW DELHI: A day after flagging the ‘reserve verdict-andforget about it’ ailment in the judiciary, Supreme Court on Monday took exception to long pendency of anticipatory bail and regular bail petitions in high courts and said the respective chief justices must ensure speedy disposal of matters relating to liberty.After learning that issues relating to bail and pleas for suspension of sentence after conviction were pending in HCs for months and getting routinely adjourned, a bench of Chief Justice Surya Kant and Justices Joymalya Bagchi and Vipul M Pancholi said, “We are extremely disappointed over the manner in which matters relating to personal liberty of individuals are dealt with by the HCs.”Though the malady pointed out related to Punjab and Haryana HC, the CJI recalled there had been earlier petitions seeking direction to high courts to expedite decisions on pleas seeking bail and, in some cases, directions were sought for urgent listing of such before HCs.The CJI said, “The delay in hearing the cases could be because of overflowing dockets or other matters requiring immediate attention of the judges, but nothing can be more important than deciding pleas for grant of bail.”The bench said, “It is equally disturbing to know that in Patna HC bail applications are not listed for hearing for months. We expect the CJs of the HCs to take some remedial measures...”The bench said this was happening despite the SC on many occasions indicating a timeline for deciding such pleas.“We are conscious of the fact that listing and prioritisation of hearing in cases is the exclusive prerogative of CJs, who are the masters of rosters,” the bench said, adding that in such situations, the SC had a bounden duty to lay down guidelines for expeditious hearing.

CHENNAI: Apollo Hospitals chairman Dr Prathap C Reddy, who turns 93 on Thursday, cuts a commanding figure — the tall cardiologist who walked away from a thriving US practice after his father’s plea to “help people in India. ” A 1979 tragedy sealed it: a 35-year-old patient died, treatment abroad unaffordable. Seeing the widow and children, he asked, “If Indian doctors save lives in the US, why not here at home?”Dr Reddy, who turns 93 Thursday, lobbied PM Indira Gandhi to ensure import duties on equipment fell from 300% to zero. Banks funded the build; cement and steel came cheap, and he built Apollo Chennai, India’s first multispecialty hospital, in 1983 with a promise to offer treatment to 25% of patients free.Dr Reddy’s zeal reshaped more than medicine. Hours before Apollo’s launch, he axed a glaring “Casualty” sign: “Why would trauma patients want to be wheeled into ‘casualties’ rooms? My staff thought people wouldn’t recognise any other word. But I insisted on changing it to ‘Emergency’. It’s now standard nationwide,” he said.He recalled how four decades on, his 4Cs mantra — clinical excellence, compassionate care, cost-effectiveness, cutting-edge technology — powers a 10,000-bed empire rivalling reputable international hospitals in cardiac procedures, organ transplants, and outcomes at a fraction of developed nations’ costs.While Southeast Asia’s first proton therapy centre hums in Chennai; Mumbai and Delhi will get next-gen upgrades, he said.His dream now is to put India on the global healthcare map. If India allows visa-on-arrival at least for friendly nations, it will double patient inflows overnight across 400 hospitals, including Apollo, spurring jobs and retaining skilled resources, including doctors and nurses. Simultaneously, India must ensure its people are healthy. Periodic health checks and health risk evaluation using AI models and genetic tests must be encouraged. “People must not assume they are healthy; they must be told they are healthy,” he said.He agrees this will not be easy without reforms in health insurance. Dr Reddy practises what he preaches. “Like any other Indian, I have all the health risks – I have been diabetic for nearly 50 years, I have hypertension, high cholesterol and I was overweight,” he said. Fifteen years ago, he suffered a heart attack.“But preventive health checks, early diagnosis and treatment, diet and regular exercises have kept me going. I still do 20 minutes’ walk every day with at least seven minutes of brisk walking. I have lost at least 15 kg from nearly 105 kg. My blood pressure and sugar levels are under control. Indians have the genetic predisposition for some non-communicable diseases, but they can all be brought under control with lifestyle and medications,” he said.","Apollo Hospitals chairman Dr Prathap C Reddy, who turns 93 on Thursday, cuts a commanding figure.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Wednesday flagged the substantial haircuts taken by creditors in proceedings under Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) after being told how the bankrupt Reliance Communications of Anil Ambani group was bought at a throwaway price by Mukesh Ambani ’s Reliance Jio.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta said, “Apropos the SC’s concern, govt of India is seriously looking into this issue arising in IBC proceedings. I cannot elaborate as I am part of that discussion. It is receiving very serious consideration at the appropriate quarter.”Advocate Prashant Bhushan told a bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justices Joymalya Bagchi and Vipul M Pancholi that Reliance Communications had outstanding dues of Rs 47,000 crore and in bankruptcy proceedings, it was sold for Rs 455 crore, that is, 1% of the outstanding amount. It was sold to his brother’s company.Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for Anil Ambani group, said such a sale was a public process, whether the buyer was a brother or anyone else. But the CJI-led bench said, “Unfortunately, IBC proceedings are misused nowadays. The assets of a company in debt are undervalued. Then it is put on a sham auction and, in a planned manner, a family member or a friend buys it.”The bench added, “Every day such matters are coming up before the court.”The SG said, “The haircut (suffered by creditors) is phenomenal.” Bhushan po-inted out that “surprisingly, bankruptcy is declared by the very company which is facing bankruptcy”.The CJI remarked, “It is a nice plan. Voluntarily declare bankruptcy and then get evaluated by friendly valuers at 10% of the market value. Unfortunately, the conduct of resolution professionals is not above board.”Rohatgi said instead of investigation and prosecution, the court could appoint a committee of experts that estimates the amount due from ADAG, and then the Anil Ambani group could repay that amount in instalments over a period of time. That would serve the purpose, he said.The bench said CBI and ED should investigate the matter thoroughly and get to the bottom of the case. “We will monitor the investigations, and if we find them to be slack in probing the cases, we will pass appropriate directions,” it said.",Supreme Court on Wednesday flagged the substantial haircuts taken by creditors in proceedings under Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) The bankrupt Reliance Communications of Anil Ambani group was bought at a throwaway price by Mukesh Ambani ’s Reliance Jio.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127920736,imgsize-138692,width-400,resizemode-4/sc-to-examine-if-ed-can-probe-case-after-predicate-acquittal.jpg"

Delhi: Over 500 women screened in mega cervical cancer camp at Budh Vihar,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-over-500-women-screened-in-mega-cervical-cancer-camp-at-budh-vihar/articleshow/127915040.cms,"Delhi: Over 500 women screened in mega cervical cancer camp at Budh Vihar

Early signs of Cervical cancer women often miss

In a landmark achievement for preventive healthcare, Novaneo Hospital on Wednesday entered the Guinness Book of World Records by collecting the highest number of cervical cancer (Pap/HPV) screening gut samples within an eight-hour window, underscoring the growing role of hospital-led initiatives in large-scale disease prevention.The record-setting feat was achieved during a mega carcinoma cervix screening camp organised by Novaneo Hospital and Delhi Cancer Hospital, in collaboration with the All India Terapanth Mahila Mandal, at the Novaneo Hospital campus in Budh Vihar. Between 9 am and 5 pm, medical teams successfully screened over 500 women, marking one of the largest single-day cervical cancer screening efforts conducted by a hospital in the region.The initiative was aimed at addressing cervical cancer, one of the most common yet preventable cancers among women in India, where late diagnosis often leads to poor outcomes. Alongside sample collection, doctors and healthcare workers provided counselling on risk factors, early warning signs and the critical importance of routine screening. Women requiring follow-up care were guided on the next steps, ensuring continuity beyond the camp.Medical teams from both hospitals conducted examinations and provided counselling on risk factors, symptoms and the importance of regular screening. Participants were also guided on follow-up care wherever required, reinforcing the message that timely detection remains the most effective tool in improving survival rates and treatment outcomes.The camp underlined the role of hospital-led outreach programmes in bridging gaps between clinical expertise and community healthcare needs. By partnering with the All India Terapanth Mahila Mandal, which has a wide grassroots presence among women, the initiative was able to reach a large and diverse group of beneficiaries in a single day.The programme also highlighted the growing clinical capabilities of the participating institutions. Novaneo Hospital has steadily built a reputation for advanced paediatric and neonatal care, anchored by a state-of-the-art 30-bedded Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). The NICU is equipped with advanced technology such as SLE 6000 infant ventilators for precise respiratory management, inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) machines critical for treating neonatal respiratory failure, and whole-body cooling systems used in the management of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. These facilities enable the hospital to handle high-risk and critically ill newborns with comprehensive care.Delhi Cancer Hospital, on the other hand, continues to focus on making oncology services more accessible and patient-friendly. Its 20-bedded oncology daycare unit operates all seven days of the week, ensuring continuity of treatment for cancer patients. With an efficient patient turnaround time of just two to three hours, the facility reduces waiting periods while maintaining quality care. The hospital also offers significant cost advantages, delivering cancer treatment at 40-60 per cent lower costs compared to corporate hospitals.The success of the cervical cancer screening camp reflects a shared commitment by Novaneo Hospital and Delhi Cancer Hospital to preventive healthcare and community engagement. Both institutions plan to continue similar outreach initiatives, with the aim of expanding access to early diagnosis and quality medical care across Delhi.",Over 500 women screened in mega cervical cancer camp at Budh Vihar in Delhi.

On Jan 22, 2026, it notified the questions for the first phase.While house listing operation involves collection of information regarding housing conditions, assets, amenities, etc. of each household in the country, the population enumeration phase captures the demographic, socio- economic, cultural, and other details of each individual. As clearly stated by the govt in a press note dated Dec 12, 2025, caste is to be enumerated in the PE phase, which is due only in February 2027. Despite this, some opposition parties have raised questions on the govt’s intent regarding caste census, asking why the questionnaire for Phase 1 did not list ‘caste’ as a field.","Census 2027 will be conducted through mobile apps, census management and monitoring portal and self-enumeration portal.

Why seasonal tourism creates India’s toughest waste management challenge,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-seasonal-tourism-creates-indias-toughest-waste-management-challenge/articleshow/127909736.cms,"Some of India’s most intense waste loads are generated where people do not live. They are generated where people visit. (Image used for representational purpose)



NEW DELHI: India’s waste problem does not grow slowly. It arrives suddenly. It shows up on long weekends, festival seasons, school holidays, and tourist peaks. Beaches fill up. Hill stations overflow. Pilgrimage towns strain. And almost overnight, public spaces begin to look different with more bottles, more wrappers, more litter in places meant to stay clean.This is not accidental. It is structural. India’s waste systems are designed around households. Door-to-door collection, scheduled pickups, all of it assumes that waste is generated where people live. But some of India’s most intense waste loads are generated where people do not live. They are generated where people visit.Beverage containers are consumed on the move. A bottle bought on a beach, a highway, or a market street is often discarded minutes later, far from any formal collection point. Once it enters public space, it is much harder to recover cleanly. Drains, waterways, forests, and roadside edges become the default endpoints.This is why tourist-heavy states face a different kind of pressure.A floating population generates waste, but does not stay long enough to be captured by household-style systems. The waste is scattered, time-bound, and highly visible.Goa makes this imbalance impossible to ignore. The state has a resident population of about 15 lakh, yet recorded approximately 1.08 crore tourist visits in 2025. That means far more people consuming beverages in public spaces than private ones. Beaches, leisure zones, highways, and markets absorb waste loads that were never meant to be managed like residential neighbourhoods.A comparable pressure plays out in the Himalayan tourism belt. Himachal Pradesh, with a resident population of 6,864,602 (2011 Census), recorded approximately 1.80 crore tourist visits in 2024. Hill towns, pilgrimage routes such as the Manimahesh Yatra corridor, forested valleys, and highway stretches see brisk consumption of packaged products during peak seasons, and their disposal often outpaces the reach of routine collection systems.In both cases, this is where the question shifts. Not “How do we clean more?” But “How do we stop waste from becoming litter in the first place?” That question has pushed attention toward the Deposit Refund Scheme, which intervenes at the moment of disposal rather than after accumulation.Deposit Refund Schemes operate on a straightforward principle. A small, fully refundable deposit is added to the price of a beverage container or packaged product. When the empty container is returned, the deposit is refunded. The container stops being disposable and becomes something worth retrieving.Behavioural economics explains why this mechanism works. People are far more motivated to avoid losing money than to comply with abstract rules. A refundable deposit creates immediate relevance at the point of disposal. The decision to discard is no longer neutral; it carries a cost.Global experience shows how consistently this logic holds. Countries with long-running deposit systems report some of the highest beverage container recovery rates in the world. Germany reports return rates of around 98 per cent. Norway and Lithuania crossed 90 per cent within a few years of implementation. The common factor across jurisdictions is not stricter enforcement, but the presence of value.For tourism-driven regions, one design feature matters more than any other: the refund is not limited to the original buyer. Anyone who returns the container receives the deposit. This is critical in high-mobility settings, where the person who consumes a product may not be the one who disposes of it responsibly. Even if a tourist leaves a bottle behind, it does not lose its worth. Someone else will collect it because it makes sense to do so.Goa’s Deposit Refund Scheme is structured around this reality. It does not replace municipal collection or processing infrastructure. It addresses a different gap, behavioural leakage in public spaces where traditional systems struggle. By attaching value to containers, the scheme aims to reduce litter before it spreads, rather than relying solely on clean-ups after the fact.Himachal Pradesh has moved in a similar direction. The state has formally notified its Deposit Refund Scheme and begun implementation planning, including a successful pilot during the Mani Mahesh Yatra, where high footfall and difficult terrain make conventional waste control especially challenging. The pilot demonstrated how deposit-linked recovery can function even in temporary, high-pressure settings.Seen together, these developments point to a broader shift in how seasonal pollution hotspots are being addressed. The issue is not a lack of laws or infrastructure. It is the concentration of waste generation in places and moments where enforcement has limited reach.Tourism will continue to drive economic growth across India’s coasts, hills, and heritage circuits. But in places where millions pass through every year, DRS offers something traditional systems often cannot: a way to influence behaviour at the exact moment waste is discarded. For states grappling with seasonal surges and public-space litter, that distinction may prove decisive.","India’s waste problem does not grow slowly.

Piyush Goyal Defends India-US Trade Deal in Lok Sabha, Says Farmers And Dairy Interests Fully Safe

The Indo-US Nuclear Deal signed under Former PM, Dr Manmohan Singh was a prime example of our commitment to mutual progress.







The Congress-UPA Govt…





— Mallikarjun Kharge (@kharge) February 4, 2026





NEW DELHI: Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge on Wednesday raised questions over the way the India–US trade deal was announced, saying the government had failed to take Parliament and the public into confidence despite the House being in session.In a post on X, Kharge said India and the United States have shared a strong global strategic partnership for several years, rooted in common democratic values.He pointed to the Indo–US civil nuclear agreement signed during the tenure of former prime minister Dr Manmohan Singh as an example of transparent and accountable decision-making. Kharge said the Congress-led UPA government had kept Parliament informed at every stage while finalising that landmark deal.He contrasted this with the present situation, saying the country knows “nothing” about the trade agreement announced by US President Donald Trump.Kharge noted that Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s public response focused only on thanking Trump for cutting tariffs on Indian goods to 18 per cent, without offering any details of the deal itself.“Parliament is in session, but the Modi government chose an outside platform to talk about the deal, without sharing any specifics,” Kharge said in his post.The Congress chief flagged three major concerns that, according to him, remain unanswered. He asked whether India had made any compromises under pressure from the United States and whether New Delhi had agreed to zero tariffs on American imports, as claimed by President Trump.Kharge also sought clarity on the impact of the deal on Indian farmers, questioning whether the agriculture sector had been fully or partially opened to US agricultural products.In addition, he raised concerns about energy ties with Moscow, asking whether India would stop buying oil from Russia and what message, if any, had been conveyed to the Russian side.The Kremlin stated on Tuesday that it has not received any official communication from New Delhi regarding the suspension of crude oil trade.“Parliament and 140 crore people of India have the right to know,” Kharge said.The questions come amid growing political debate over the India–US trade framework, under which Washington has agreed to lower tariffs on Indian exports to 18 per cent from much higher levels. The agreement has been announced at the framework level, with several details yet to be made public.Defending the deal in the Lok Sabha, Union commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal said India had successfully protected its sensitive sectors, especially agriculture and dairy, after nearly a year of negotiations.He said discussions had been ongoing since Prime Minister Modi’s visit to the US in February 2025 and that the final outcome was balanced and mutually beneficial. Goyal also stressed that energy security remained a top priority for the government.Earlier, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi intensified his attack on the Prime Minister, alleging that PM Modi was “under pressure” and had been “compromised” in finalising the deal.The Congress has demanded that the full details of the trade agreement be placed before Parliament, particularly on agriculture, tariffs and India’s oil purchases from Russia.","Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge raises questions over the way the India–US trade deal was announced.

A Chance to Build a Future-Ready Indirect Tax System

(Jayashree Parthasarathy is Tax Partner, EY India. With contributions from Ketan Lohia, Director-tax, EY India)

India’s growth aspirations demand a tax environment that is simpler, more predictable and aligned with modern business realities. While GST and Customs digitalisation have undeniably transformed the landscape, companies continue to face operational bottlenecks that slow down activity, tie up working capital and drive up compliance costs. These factors directly affect the country’s ease of doing business.In this backdrop, the 56th GST Council meeting marked significant progress by tackling several long-standing pain points. Union Budget 2026 now has an opportunity to build on this momentum and deliver a tax ecosystem that is faster, more consistent and easier for businesses to navigate.A key long pending ask and expectation from the upcoming Budget is a more flexible and business-friendly input tax credit (ITC) system. Companies have long argued that credits representing taxes genuinely paid and used in business operations should be freely available or refunded.Two specific asks remain critical:Allowing smoother credit flow across GST registrations would also unlock meaningful liquidity for enterprises.The recent GST Council decision to treat intermediary services as exports (therefore removing the GST levy) is a welcome step and industry now awaits its formal implementation as a part of the budget process.Businesses are also expecting similar clarity for R&D and testing services, which currently attract 18% GST because place-of-performance rules prevent them from being classified as exports. A consistent and globally aligned export definition would boost India’s competitiveness in high-value service segments.Compliance complexity remains a major concern with an expectation that multiplicity of proceedings would be addressed. A single, centralised audit and faceless assessment system, similar to the efficient model used under the erstwhile service tax regime, would give pan India businesses one point of engagement, reduce repetitive scrutiny and minimise conflicting interpretations across States.Large taxpayers would particularly benefit from a centralized single point of contact approach by way of:A uniform, risk-based audit framework would further enhance consistency and limit unnecessary scrutiny. Equally important is a more calibrated enforcement approach; one that acts firmly against evasion but avoids punitive measures such as asset attachments or frequent detention of goods in cases involving interpretational differences or procedural lapses. A clearer differentiation between wilful violations and good-faith positions will go a long way in restoring business confidence.For India’s smallest enterprises, current GST registration thresholds (₹20 lakh for services and ₹40 lakh for goods) no longer reflect today’s cost structures. Near-decade-high inflation has pushed many micro-businesses into the GST net perhaps far earlier than intended. Raising the threshold to reflect current realities would preserve working capital and support MSME viability.On the Customs side, businesses continue to face prolonged timelines in dispute resolution, with legacy cases stretching for years and delaying investment decisions. A time-bound settlement mechanism, similar to earlier dispute-resolution schemes, would help clear the backlog and allow both industry and the department to focus on priority matters.Businesses are also seeking greater certainty through longer-validity advance rulings and simpler renewals, so long-term projects are not disrupted by tax disputes merely on account of lapse of time.Operational friction also remains a day-to-day challenge at the border. Even after goods are cleared, companies often face manual processes to pay differential duties or correct documents for host of reasons including price variation, corrections. Allowing digital payments and online amendments, and ensuring such payments qualify for GST credit, would reduce compliance effort and minimise cash-flow disruptions.Cross-border businesses are also looking for clearer, time-bound guidelines around Special Valuation Branch (SVB) proceedings. While scrutiny of related-party pricing is necessary, inconsistent practices often create uncertainty for global supply chains. Predictable timelines and uniform standards are essential if India is to position itself as a reliable global hub.Special Economic Zone (SEZ) units seeking to sell into the domestic market face a structural disadvantage, as duties are levied without fully recognising that these units often use domestic inputs. Aligning duty calculations to reflect only the imported content, and/ or extending select benefits available under free trade agreements, would improve capacity utilisation and offer SEZs a more level playing field vis-à-vis foreign suppliers.Budget 2026 offers an opportunity not just for incremental fixes but for meaningful reform that strengthens India’s indirect tax architecture. The foundation laid by GST and recent digitalisation efforts is robust. What businesses now need is a system that is simpler, more consistent and aligned with the needs of a rapidly expanding economy.If India gets this right, indirect tax reform can become a catalyst not only for smoother compliance, but for accelerating the country’s growth trajectory.","India’s growth aspirations demand a tax environment that is simpler, more predictable and aligned with modern business realities.

Stock market today: Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , the Indian equity benchmark indices, opened in red on Thursday. While Nifty50 went below 25,700, BSE Sensex was down over 400 points. At 10:05 AM, Nifty50 was trading at 25,636.90, down 139 points or 0.54%. BSE Sensex was at 83,372.56, down 445 points or 0.53%.Stock market analysts expect domestic equities to hold a positive bias, supported by recent trade deals with the US and the European Union, budget-related announcements and ongoing third-quarter earnings.Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited says, “There are a few near-term market trends that are significant. The Nifty appears to be in a consolidation phase without big moves at the index level. However, there are big changes within the Nifty stocks with big declines in IT stocks consequent to the IT sell off in the US spreading to India, too. The sell off has been triggered by Anthropic’s new automation tools that the market fears may replace IT services that are presently outsourced. The market fears significant margin pressure for Indian IT companies. What the real impact will be remains to be seen.”“In contrast to the weakness in IT stocks, the large domestic consumption-driven segments are doing well and this is reflected in the resilience of leaders like RIL, Bharti, the banking majors and some auto stocks.After the growth-oriented Budget and trade deals with the EU and US, India’s growth will remain strong facilitating strong domestic consumption. The low-interest rate regime continues to support the growth of the auto sector and is likely to spill over into segments like air conditioners as summer approaches. Therefore, the strong domestic consumption story is likely to sustain the resilience of the domestic consumption- driven stocks. If the cessation of selling and marginal buying by FIIs becomes a trend, the market will gain strength. This is the data point to watch for.""Investor activity reflected the cautious mood, with foreign portfolio investors marginally net buying equities worth Rs 30 crore during the session. Domestic institutional investors also stayed on the buying side, purchasing shares worth Rs 240 crore, according to exchange data.Global cues were mixed, with US stocks ending lower overnight. Wall Street was weighed down by losses in technology counters such as Advanced Micro Devices and Palantir, as concerns grew over elevated valuations and doubts emerged about the sustainability of the AI-led rally. Alphabet shares slipped nearly 2 per cent ahead of its quarterly earnings announcement, though the stock recovered around 2 per cent in after-hours trading after the company signalled a sharp increase in spending to strengthen its position in artificial intelligence.","Nifty50 and BSE Sensex opened in red on Thursday.

India's trade through deals

Has India managed to secure the ‘father of all deals’ with the US? American President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi took everyone by surprise this week when they announced that the tariff rate on Indian goods to the US will be reduced to 18%. While a trade deal remains to be signed, and final nuances are being worked out, the stalemate in ties has finally ended, paving the way for two big world economies to resume normalcy in trade ties.The US is India’s single largest trading partner, and the 50% tariffs imposed by the Trump administration had hit exporters. With an 18% tariff rate, India’s exports are back to being competitive. Trump’s Truth Social Post spoke of several aspects to the deal including what he claimed was commitment to stopping Russian crude and also buying $500 billion worth of American goods.With an 18% tariff, India has managed to secure a deal which places its duty rate lower than its neighbouring countries and competitors.Some of the main countries which compete with India’s labour-intensive sectors in the global markets are: Vietnam (20%), Malaysia (19%, Bangladesh (20%), Cambodia and Thailand (19%), China (34%).India has also got a lower rate than Pakistan which gets tariffed at 19%.Commerce minister Piyush Goyal has also stressed on this point, saying that India got a ‘very good’ deal with the US, better than the competitors.Agneshwar Sen, Trade Policy leader, EY India says that the biggest takeaway is that India has shifted from being a passive tariff-hit exporter to a partner with a negotiated stake in the US market.“For India, the deal matters less for the headline concessions and more for what it signals. Since the new tariff rates will come into effect immediately, to start with it will arrest the export erosion we have been facing. India was steadily losing competitiveness in the US because the high tariffs were wiping out marginal advantages of quality and dependability. The deal will effectively cap further damage and restore predictability, allowing exporters to price, plan and retain market share rather than bleed slowly,” he tells TOI.“It will reinforce India’s credibility as a supply-chain alternative. The deal positions India as a reliable, lower-risk sourcing partner at a time when US buyers are seeking to de-risk from China,” Sen explains.“Finally, it will nudge Indian exporters to move up the value chain. Tariff relief will push Indian firms toward scale, compliance and higher value manufacturing, rather than operate on pure price arbitrage. The bottom line is that the deal doesn’t just recover lost exports - it reanchors India in the US market - and on a more durable, strategic basis, which is far more valuable over the medium term,” Sen adds.Gulzar Didwania, Partner, Deloitte India also highlights the important point that India has secured a level playing field in terms of tariff treatment vis-à-vis key competing economies in South Asia such as Vietnam, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.“Unlike earlier situations where some countries enjoyed distinctly preferential access, India is now broadly aligned within the same tariff bracket, reducing relative disadvantages for Indian exporters,” he tells TOI.As part of the newly announced trade deal, US President Donald Trump claimed that India would stop buying Russian oil. “We spoke about many things, including Trade, and ending the War with Russia and Ukraine. He agreed to stop buying Russian Oil, and to buy much more from the United States and, potentially, Venezuela,” Trump posted on Truth Social. Meanwhile, Russia has maintained that it received no official communication from India on the matter. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, “so far, we haven’t heard any statements from New Delhi on this matter.”According to officials, imports from Russia have already been declining since November after the US imposed sanctions on major exporters Rosneft and Lukoil.Data from Kpler show Russia’s share of India’s crude imports fell to 33.7% between April and November 2025, from 37.9% in the same period last year. Over the same time, US share rose to 8.1 per cent from 4.6%. In absolute terms, Russian crude imports dropped from about 1.8 million barrels per day in November to 1.2 million in December and 1.16 million in January 2026.Despite this trend, analysts say the trade deal is unlikely to result in an immediate or sharp fall in Russian supplies. “The deal is unlikely to result in a near-term reduction in India’s Russian crude imports. Russian volumes remain largely locked in for the next 8-10 weeks and continue to be economically critical for India’s complex refining system, supported by deep discounts on Urals relative to ICE Brent,” said Sumit Ritolia, lead research analyst at Kpler.According to experts Russian imports will remain broadly stable through the first half of 2026–27, with any further moderation likely to be balanced by higher inflows from West Asia.A recent SBI Research report suggests that India could potentially save almost $3 billion in its crude imports bill annually, by redirecting part of its Russian oil purchases to Venezuela.The report said replacing some Russian crude with Venezuelan heavy crude could deliver meaningful savings for India, even after accounting for higher freight, logistics and related costs. It noted that Venezuelan crude would need to be priced at a discount of about $10–12 per barrel to make the switch commercially workable for Indian importers.SBI said, “India's fuel import bill could even decline by $3bn in the event of shifting to Venezuela… discount of $10–12 could make the choice agnostic.”According to Oil Price data cited in the report, Venezuelan heavy crude is currently trading at around $51 per barrel. The study further added that the actual benefit would depend on several factors, including the size of the discount compared with Brent crude, longer shipping routes, and additional time and insurance costs associated with sourcing oil from Venezuela.The India–US trade deal cuts tariffs on almost 60% of Indian exports to the US, lowering reciprocal duties to 18% from 50%. The agreement is expected to deliver a clear boost for exporters while also supporting GDP growth and investor sentiment.Sectors ranging from garments, leather, footwear, carpets, shrimps and gems and jewellery are set to benefit, as Indian products will become more competitive in the US market. For garments, the 18% levy is marginally lower than the 20% faced by Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. Meanwhile, the jewellery and gems sector is also waiting for the deal’s fine print.With tariffs now rolled back, uncertainty has also eased sharply. “We estimate an incremental boost of around 0.2 percentage point of GDP (annualised), if the new lower tariffs are enforced,” Goldman Sachs said, adding that the estimate is based on India’s goods exports exposure of roughly 4% of GDP to US final demand and a goods export demand elasticity of about 0.7.Earlier estimates had suggested a GDP impact in the 30–50 basis points range. Barclays said, “Statistically speaking, we estimate lower tariffs will add 30 basis points to headline GDP growth (essentially reversing the threat posed by 50% tariffs until now).”Latest projections show the economy growing 7.4% in the current fiscal year ending March, with growth for FY27 seen in the 6.8%–7.2% range. Moody’s Ratings said the reduction in US tariffs on most Indian goods would reinvigorate exports to the US, India’s largest goods export market, accounting for about 21% of total goods exports in the first eleven months of 2025.Arvind Shrivastava, secretary, department of revenue, said that the deal would deepen trade ties and create new opportunities for labour-intensive and manufacturing sectors, while also giving a push to collaboration in high and advanced technology areas. M. Nagaraju, secretary, department of financial services, said that the rollback to 18% lifted the “dark clouds of uncertainty” and would help exporters.For exporters, especially smaller firms that had slowed or halted shipments, the timing is critical. With summer consignments already dispatched and fears looming over the next season, the tariff cut has restored competitiveness and eased pressure after months of discount-led survival.The Indian stock market and rupee which have been hit badly by the persistent outflow of foreign investors’ money have taken a breather - both rallying strongly after the trade deal announcement.The surge in Sensex left Indian investors richer by a massive Rs 12 lakh crore on Tuesday! In fact, it was the fifth biggest single-day gain in history. The market had been languishing, with some spurts of rallies and some downturns in the last few months, waiting for the conclusion of the trade deal which lifted clouds of uncertainty.Market experts expect the rally to continue as more details of the trade deal emerge in the coming days.“With this deal announcement, we believe that the market will now begin to accord correct weightage to the improving trajectory of corporate earnings growth, which has shown successive improvement over the quarters with an improving earnings revision trend,” Motilal Oswal Financial Services said in a report.“This is a high-impact development and will have a multi-layered positive effect on the Indian economy, prevailing market sentiments, and sectors exporting to the US, which will benefit from better competitiveness,” it said.Tuesday’s rally was proof that the announcement has been met with cheer from foreign institutional investors as they led the rally, with their net inflow in stocks at Rs 5,236 crore.The Indian rupee, the worst performing Asian currency last year, appreciated 124 paise to 90.27 against the dollar. It logged its strongest single-day gain in seven years and the best since late 2018.Trump’s announcement that India has agreed to “BUY AMERICAN” at a higher level than before triggered concerns, particularly over agriculture. Since trade negotiations began, India has drawn a firm line on protecting its dairy and farm sectors.Piyush Goyal has clarified that the priorities still have not shifted and the dairy and agriculture sectors are still protected. Speaking in Lok Sabha, the minister said, “during negotiations, the Indian side successfully ensured the protection of its sensitive sectors, particularly agriculture and dairy,” he said, noting that the US too had areas it considered sensitive.On the US side, trade representative Jamieson Greer also confirmed that though India agreed to cut tariffs on industrial goods to zero from 13.5%, the agriculture segment is still safeguarded.Agriculture has long been the biggest flashpoint in India-US trade talks, with Washington pressing for greater access to India’s dairy and agricultural markets. US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick had even accused India of shutting out American farmers, questioning why it would not import “even a bushel” of US corn.The decision to safeguard the sector is not solely commercial, rather it is non-negotiable. The agriculture and dairy sector sits at the heart of rural life and food security. Farming and allied activities, including animal husbandry, support the livelihoods of over 700 million people.India is largely self-sufficient in food production, while countries such as the US, Australia and the European Union treat agriculture as a major export business. Opening Indian markets to heavily subsidised farm products from these regions could flood the country with cheap imports, sharply undercutting farmer incomes.India already maintains agricultural tariffs ranging from zero to 150%. The US also follows a similar approach, imposing steep duties on select products such as tobacco, which attracts tariffs of up to 350%.The ‘mother of all trade deals’ - the recently concluded India-EU Free Trade Agreement - may have been what finally spurred the Trump administration into action. According to a News Week analysis, it led the US government to blink.While discussions for a trade deal with the European Union had been ongoing, this time, “the trade agreement with the EU appears to have provided a strong goad for the US to wrap up the long-lingering negotiations with India,” says a TOI report.Talks between India and the US for a trade deal had continued, despite the 50% tariffs imposed by the latter. While Trump and PM Modi continued to talk, Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal and External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar also engaged in talks with their respective counterparts. The arrival of the new US Ambassador to India Sergio Gor also seems to have worked to help push for the trade deal.While experts and analysts have welcomed the news as a positive for the Indian economy, they also caution that details of the deal need to emerge for a better understanding of what it holds for each sector and the economy as a whole.Piyush Goyal has said that a joint statement by the countries will be issued soon.“Experience suggests caution. The US–Korea FTA showed how initial optimism can be diluted by ‘later’ safeguards and reinterpretations while recent tariff threats linked to Greenland-related geopolitical tensions underscore how strategic considerations can quickly reshape trade outcomes,” says JM Financial in a report.","The US is India's single largest trading partner, and the 50% tariffs imposed by the Trump administration had hit exporters. With an 18% tariff rate, India’s exports are back to being competitive. India has also got a lower rate than Pakistan which gets tariffed at 19%.Commerce minister Piyush Goyal has also stressed on this point, saying that India got a'very good' deal with the US.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127912116,imgsize-70446,width-400,resizemode-4/india-us-trade-deal.jpg"

The note added that the trade deal could strengthen growth certainty and help sustain momentum seen in high-frequency indicators.""We also believe the RBI is now done cutting rates but will continue to manage its liquidity provisions carefully to ensure rate transmission remains active,"" the note said.Deepak Agrawal, CIO - Debt, Kotak Mahindra AMC, said the upcoming policy comes amid a supportive domestic macro backdrop.""With inflation well below the target, growth momentum intact, surplus system liquidity, and fiscal consolidation reaffirmed, conditions favour policy stability. While global uncertainties remain, India's relatively strong growth dynamics, improving external position, and record foreign exchange reserves provide the MPC with ample comfort to stay on pause,"" Agrawal said, PTI quoted.He added that easing tariff pressures and trade developments could support the rupee and allow the RBI to manage durable liquidity conditions.""Accordingly, the committee is expected to maintain the repo rate unchanged at 5.25 per cent; however, forward guidance is likely to remain mildly dovish, underscoring a data-dependent stance and preserving flexibility for recalibration should the growth-inflation trade-off evolve,"" Agrawal said.Lokanath Panda, COO, BLS E-Services, linked policy expectations to Budget 2026’s structural reform focus and infrastructure push.""Against this backdrop, the RBI's MPC is likely to pause its rate cuts. Having already lowered the repo rate by 125 basis points since early 2025 with the last cut in December which helped the banks interest rates reduction and increased liquidity in the market, we expect the central bank is now poised to concentrate on liquidity conditions, bond market stability, and currency risk management,"" Panda said.The government has tasked the RBI with maintaining CPI-based retail inflation at 4 per cent, with a tolerance band of 2 per cent on either side. Inflation has remained below 4 per cent since February 2024 and stood at 1.33 per cent in December, while January data is due later this month.Ashok Kapur, Chairman, Krishna Group and Krisumi Corporation, said a stable rate environment could support growth and housing demand.""At this juncture, a stable interest rate environment will play a key role in reinforcing buyer confidence, sustaining housing momentum, and supporting developers in driving new launches and job creation, thereby contributing meaningfully to overall economic growth,"" Kapur said.The MPC members also include Nagesh Kumar, Saugata Bhattacharya, Ram Singh, Poonam Gupta and Indranil Bhattacharyya.","The six-member Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), headed by RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra, started discussions on the next set of bi-monthly interest rates. A BofA Global Research note said the RBI’s rate-cutting cycle appears to be over for now.

Anthropic AI: Explained: What is Anthropic's AI tool that wiped $285 billion off software stocks in a single day,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/explained-what-is-anthropics-ai-tool-that-wiped-285-billion-off-software-stocks-in-a-single-day/articleshow/127892310.cms,"What exactly did Anthropic release

Why the market panic over a folder of prompts

What does this mean for the software industry going forward

Anthropic's newly launched AI plugins have triggered what analysts are calling a 'SaaSpocalypse'—a brutal selloff that wiped out roughly $285 billion from software, legal tech and financial services stocks in a single trading session. The AI developer, known for its Claude chatbot, released 11 open-source plugins for its Claude Cowork tool on Friday, January 30. One of them targets legal workflows, and that alone was enough to send investors running for the exits.Thomson Reuters dropped over 15%. RELX, owner of LexisNexis, fell 14%. LegalZoom got hammered nearly 20%. A Goldman Sachs basket tracking US software stocks posted its worst single-day decline since April's tariff-driven selloff. The Nasdaq fell 1.4%, with ripple effects extending to Indian IT giants—Infosys ADRs slipped 5.5% and Wipro fell nearly 5%.Claude Cowork is an agentic AI assistant that Anthropic launched earlier in January. Think of it as Claude Code—the company's developer-focused coding tool—but redesigned for non-technical professionals. It can read files, organise folders, draft documents and carry out multi-step tasks with user consent.The plugins announced last Friday supercharge this capability. They let companies tailor Claude to specific job functions by specifying how work should be done, which tools and data to pull from, and what workflows to automate. Anthropic open-sourced 11 starter plugins covering productivity, sales, marketing, finance, data analysis, customer support, product management and biology research.But it was the legal plugin that spooked markets. It automates contract review, NDA triage, compliance checks and legal briefings. Anthropic was careful to note that all outputs should be reviewed by licensed attorneys and that the tool does not provide legal advice. That disclaimer did little to calm investors.Here's the thing that has caught many observers off guard: the legal plugin is essentially a set of prompts and configurations. There's no proprietary model fine-tuned on case law, no special legal reasoning engine. It's Claude being Claude, but with structured workflow instructions.The real signal, analysts say, is that Anthropic has moved from selling the model to owning the workflow. When Claude was just an API, companies like Thomson Reuters could build on top of it. Thomson Reuters literally runs CoCounsel on OpenAI. But when Anthropic starts publishing ready-made vertical solutions, the platform becomes the competitor.Jefferies dubbed the selloff a 'SaaSpocalypse', noting that investor sentiment has shifted dramatically. The narrative used to be that AI helps software companies. Now it's that AI replaces them. 'Trading is very much get-me-out style selling,' said Jeffrey Favuzza from Jefferies' equity trading desk. The brokerage also noted that OpenAI appears to be losing ground in the corporate market to Anthropic's Claude, with enterprises now accounting for 80% of Anthropic's business.The damage extended well beyond legal tech. DocuSign fell 11%, Salesforce dropped nearly 7%, Adobe slid 7%, and ServiceNow declined 7%. Business development companies with exposure to software loans also got caught in the selling. Blue Owl Capital Corp fell 13%, marking a record ninth consecutive decline.Anthropic isn't the only player in legal AI. Startups like Harvey AI (valued at $5 billion) and Legora ($1.8 billion valuation) have been developing tools for years. But Anthropic's advantage is that it builds its own underlying models. Firms like Legora rely on models from developers like Anthropic, which means Claude's creator can potentially disrupt both traditional legal services and the startups trying to disrupt them.The company's growth trajectory underscores why investors are taking this threat seriously. Claude Code hit $1 billion in annualised recurring revenue by November, just months after its May launch. Anthropic is now reportedly raising $20 billion at a $350 billion valuation—up sharply from $61.5 billion in March 2025.The iteration speed is also striking. Cowork launched on January 12. The plugins dropped less than three weeks later. Enterprise software companies typically spend quarters on such releases.For software executives watching the carnage unfold, the takeaway is uncomfortable but clear: Anthropic didn't need a breakthrough product to rattle markets. It just needed to show what Claude could already do—and hit publish.","Anthropic released 11 open-source plugins for its Claude Cowork tool on Friday, January 30.Thomson Reuters dropped over 15%.

CZI’s focus on Biohub

Gates Foundation to cut up to 500 jobs by 2030

The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) – the philanthropy organisation founded by Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Prisicila Chan has cut roughly 8% of its workforce, reports Fortune. The job cut, impacting around 70 employees, comes as the company plans to expand its biomedical and science focus through Biohub. The move “underscores how big donors are racing to back science-heavy, tech-centric projects such as peers like the Gates Foundation,” the report said. For those unaware, Gates Foundation was founded by Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and his ex-wife Melinda French Gates. The foundation, which plans to shut down in 2045, has announced to donate a whopping $9 billion in 2026 alone “primarily focused on health care and disease research.”CZI aims to concentrate its resources on Biohub, a growing network of biomedical research institutes that aims to “cure or prevent all disease. As explained in the Fortune report, the job cuts come as CZI is stepping “a little further back from its original focus areas of education, criminal justice reform, housing, and community development” and “now needs employees with expertise in their new coverage areas”.The laid off employees will get 60-days notice period along with a severance package with 16 weeks of base pay, health insurance, and a $10,000 stipend.Biohub is a nonprofit biomedical research organization founded by Chan and Zuckerberg to help scientists cure, prevent, or manage all diseases by the end of the century. Established in 2016 Biohub is a key part of CZI and has an operating budget of about $1 billion per year. Since its inception, the couple has donated $4 billion to basic science research, and aims to double it in the next decade.Speaking during an event at the Biohub Imaging Institute in Redwood City in November last year, Zuckerberg said “I feel like the science work that we’ve done, the Biohub model in particular, has been the most impactful thing that we have done”. “So we want to really double down on that. Biohub is going to be the main focus of our philanthropy going forward,” quoted an Associated Press report then.In a November 2025 blog post, the couple wrote “We will continue our other philanthropic efforts as well, but the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative will serve as infrastructure and support for our initiatives. There will be many challenges, but we believe that achieving some of humanity’s long-term dreams will also come within reach.”In a related news, Bill Gates has started putting in place the first major steps toward closing the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, one of the world’s most-influential philanthropic organisation. The foundation’s board has approved a cap on operating costs, limiting them to $1.25 billion a year, or about 14% of its budget. To meet that limit, the organisation will reduce its workforce by 500, including by leaving some positions unfilled.","The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) has cut roughly 8% of its workforce.

BENGALURU: Namma Metro, among the most expensive Metro rail systems in the country, is set to become even more costly for commuters.After a steep fare hike of up to 71% last year, Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) is likely to implement another round of fare revision, further burdening passengers.BMRCL sources said the Fare Fixation Committee (FFC) report is binding on the Metro operator and, as per its provisions, fares are set to increase by 5% with effect from Feb 9. BMRCL is likely to notify the new fares Thursday.At present, Namma Metro fares range from Rs 10 to Rs 90. The proposed hike is expected to translate into an increase of Re 1 to Rs 5, depending on the distance travelled.In Feb last year, based on FFC's recommendations, BMRCL initially proposed a fare hike of over 110%. However, following widespread public backlash, the fare matrix was revised, capping the maximum hike at 71%.Despite strong opposition from commuters and elected representatives, who also flagged several alleged flaws in the FFC report, the revised hike was implemented. The issue also triggered political sparring between the BJP and Congress, but commuters ultimately found no relief.The FFC report empowered BMRCL to increase fares by 5% annually through an ""automatic fare revision formula"".This mechanism will remain in force until new FFC recommendations come into effect.BMRCL has been maintaining that fare hikes are necessary to meet its financial obligations. In the last financial year (2024–25), it reported an operational profit of Rs 229.4 crore. However, its loss after tax widened to Rs 623.9 crore, compared with Rs 350.7 crore in 2023–24.Additional chief secretary of urban development department Tushar Giri Nath said, ""The state govt has not issued any directions to BMRCL on fare revision. Decisions on fare revision are taken by the BMRCL board.""BMRCL MD J Ravishankar was not available for comments.","Namma Metro, among the most expensive Metro rail systems in the country, is set to become even more costly for commuters.

UK aviation regulator seeks explanation from Air India over Boeing fuel switch issue,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/uk-aviation-regulator-seeks-explanation-from-air-india-over-the-boeing-fuel-switch-issue/articleshow/127923617.cms,"



MUMBAI: Following media reports of an on-ground Air India Boeing 787 fuel control switch malfunction in London the UK’s civil aviation regulator has sought information from the airline on the maintenance work done on the said aircraft in London before it was cleared to take off for Bengaluru.In a letter sent to Air India, the UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) said that Air India should submit a complete response within a week failing which it could face regulatory action. Foreign regulators seeking information from the operator following an incident/accident is a standard process done to ensure continued compliance with safety standards.On Feb 1 in London Air India crew of flight AI-132 observed on two occasions that the left engine fuel control switch did not remain positively latched in the “RUN” position when light vertical pressure was applied. On a subsequent attempt, the switch latched correctly and remained stable and the crew went on to operate the flight in Bengaluru where the aircraft was grounded for further inspection. The ministry of civil aviation on Tuesday said that at Bengaluru during the check both left and right switches were checked and found satisfactoryAir India on Wednesday said that it had completed precautionary re-inspections of the Fuel Control Switch (FCS) across its entire operational fleet of Boeing 787 aircraft and found no issues. “The inspections were undertaken in an abundance of caution following an observation reported by one of our pilots,” Air India said.“We acknowledge the regulator’s (Indian regulator, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation) proactive oversight in conducting independent inspections and subsequently clearing the FCS,” the airline statement said. The airline added that it will fully adhere to the regulator’s guidance to circulate original equipment manufacturer (OEM)-recommended operating procedures related to the operation of the Fuel Control Switch to all flight crew members.Air India operates the Boeing 787 Dreamliner on several long-haul international routes including to the UK.Responding to the ministry’s statement about the component working satisfactorily, the Safety Matters Foundation, an NGO on Wednesday submitted a complaint to the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB). The Foundation warned that publicly giving a “clean chit” to the Fuel Control Switch while the AAIB investigation is active amounts to an “institutional bypass,” potentially contaminating evidence, prejudicing the investigative narrative, and eroding public trust. It urged the AAIB to secure all related evidence and reaffirm its independence.The Foundation’s complaint said that such public exoneration of a system by a regulatory body, while an independent safety investigation is underway, constitutes an “institutional bypass.” The action risks contaminating evidence as components and records from the AI132 incident may be handled or altered without the strict, sealed chain-of-custody required for material evidence in a major accident probe. It also involves prejudicing the narrative as publicly framing a potential causal factor as “resolved” can influence witness memory, expert analysis, and the investigative focus of the AI171 inquiry. These actions erode public trust, the Foundation said. “It undermines confidence in the AAIB’s statutory independence and the finality of its conclusions, which are crucial for learning lessons and restoring public faith in aviation safety,” it added.“The AAIB’s mandate is to find the cause, not to confirm pre-stated conclusions,” said Capt. Amit Singh, Founder-Director of Safety Matters Foundation and a senior safety advocate. “When another agency publicly closes the book on a system that may be relevant to an open crash investigation, it doesn’t just risk evidence, it risks the entire truth-seeking process. The public deserves an investigation led by evidence, not by narrative. ”The Foundation made an urgent request to the AAIB to immediately take custody of all evidence from the AI132 occurrence, placing it under a sealed AAIB chain-of-custody, issue a preservation Order, which was to direct all parties to preserve and not interfere with any related evidence and assert its authority by publicly clarifying that its investigation remains independent and that no external statement is determinative of its findings. The Foundation added that AAIB should also launch an Inquiry and examine whether the DGCA’s communications have adversely impacted the AI171 investigation.","UK's civil aviation regulator seeks information from the airline on the maintenance work done on the said aircraft.

LUCKNOW: Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Limited ( UPPCL ) has launched a two-week campaign to pull lakhs of smart meter users out of negative balances that now total Rs 1,066.66 crore statewide.Negative balance means that a consumer has consumed more electricity than paid for, resulting in outstanding dues.Internal dashboards show that of 54.81 lakh prepaid consumers recorded in meter data management system, 44.02 lakh (about 80%) are in the red.UPPCL managing director Pankaj Kumar has issued directives to all distribution companies to run special awareness campaign from Feb 2-17 focusing on three basics – asking consumers to recharge, verifying mobile numbers via OTP, and onboarding them to UPPCL smart app.Superintending engineers will act as nodal officers, substation-wise lists of negative-balance consumers will be circulated, and teams will conduct outreach, training, and publicity.Officials said that consumers were being asked to keep a positive balance as persistent negatives could lead to disconnection.According to the letter, PuVVNL carries largest burden with 15.54 lakh consumers (Rs 374.19 crore) followed by MVVNL (9.9 lakh consumers; Rs 248.85 crore), PVVNL (7.89 lakh consumers; Rs 223.87 crore), DVVNL (10.29 lakh consumers; Rs 209.73 crore; and KESCo (41,166 consumers; Rs 10.02 crore).The depth of dues is uneven. The Rs 1,001-5,000 band, with 14.36 lakh consumers, has the highest amount of Rs 322.43 crore. At least 25.48 lakh consumers owe up to Rs 1,000. A smaller but high-risk tail remains with 5,147 consumers owing over Rs 1 lakh (total Rs 160.1 crore).Recharge behaviour is another red flag with 2.65 crore consumers showing ‘never recharged’, hinting at onboarding gaps and data hygiene issues.“Areas with deep arrears — such as Varanasi-zone 1, Gorakhpur-zone 1, Sitapur, and Ayodhya — may need targeted recovery and grievance redressal beyond awareness drives,” an official said.Avadhesh Kumar Verma, a member of UPERC advisory committee and chairperson of UP Rajya Vidyut Upbhokta Parishad, claimed that over 54 lakh of the state’s 3.62 crore electricity consumers were given prepaid meters without their consent, in violation of Section 47(5) of the Electricity Act 2003.He said that widespread complaints about faulty billing, absence of proper meter testing, and the failure of grievance-redressal mechanisms had intensified public resentment; despite official claims of having over 3 lakh check meters, lakhs of smart meters have never been tested, leaving consumers unsure whether their readings are correct.","Negative balance means that a consumer has consumed more electricity than paid for.

Rupee opened in green on Thursday, rising 7 paise to reach 90.40 against US dollar. The currency was supported by corporate dollar demand, while investors remained cautious as they awaited fine print of the India-US trade deal.According to markets, the market mood has shifted from optimism to caution, with participants waiting for official confirmation, as neither India nor the US has released formal documentation or published the final terms of the agreement so far.Sentiment also remained guarded ahead of the Reserve Bank of India’s interest rate decision scheduled for Friday.At the interbank foreign exchange market, the domestic currency opened at 90.52 against the US dollar and later firmed up to 90.40, registering a 7-paise gain compared with its previous close. On Wednesday, the rupee had weakened by 15 paise to close at 90.47 against the greenback. During early trade on Thursday, it also touched a low of 90.53.“Market is now waiting for confirmation and finer details before extending the rupee's rally further,” CR forex advisors managing director Amit Pabari told PTI.He noted that attention has now shifted to the RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee meeting. “Markets widely expect the central bank to keep interest rates unchanged tomorrow, with a growing consensus that rate cuts are unlikely at least until the end of 2026,” he said.In the global markets, the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, was trading 0.18% higher at 97.79. Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, was down 2% at $68.07 per barrel in futures trade.From a technical standpoint, Pabari highlighted strong support levels for the rupee. “Technically, the 89.80–90.00 zone has emerged as a strong support base. With this area holding firmly, the pair now appears poised to move back toward the 90.80–91.20 range with greater conviction,” he said, adding that “going forward, RBI actions will also remain a key factor to watch along with confirmation of the final trade agreement and its exact terms. ”Domestic equity benchmarks opened lower in early trade. Meanwhile, foreign institutional investors were net buyers in the equity market on Wednesday, purchasing shares worth Rs 29.79 crore, according to exchange data.","Rupee opened in green on Thursday, rising 7 paise to reach 90.40 against US dollar.

Dubai has taken a major step toward realising one of the most ambitious transport innovations of the 21st century. The Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) of Dubai has officially signed a contract with Elon Musk ’s The Boring Company (TBC) to build the Dubai Loop, a futuristic underground transport system aimed at drastically cutting commute times and easing congestion in the emirate’s busiest districts.The announcement was amplified on social media when TBC tweeted about the partnership, thanking key UAE leaders including Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum and Mattar Al Tayer and was retweeted by Elon Musk himself with the caption, “Boring Company to build Dubai Loop! (sic)” and accompanying visuals of the project.The Dubai Loop is a groundbreaking underground transport project developed in partnership between Dubai’s RTA and The Boring Company. It seeks to introduce a network of tunnels beneath the city through which vehicles, potentially including Tesla cars, will shuttle passengers quickly between major hubs. The project is part of Dubai’s wider vision to adopt cutting-edge, sustainable mobility solutions that match its reputation as a global smart city According to the official RTA release, the first phase of implementation will focus on a 6.4-kilometer pilot route with four stations connecting major areas, notably the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) and Dubai Mall. This phase is expected to lay the groundwork for further expansion across the city. Once complete, the full Dubai Loop network is projected to span up to 22.2–24 kilometers, including 19 stations, reaching from Dubai World Trade Centre and the financial district through to Business Bay and central commercial zones.One of the most eye-catching aspects of the Dubai Loop is its potential to dramatically cut travel times. For example, the route between DIFC and Dubai Mall, which normally takes around 20 minutes by road, could be reduced to as little as three minutes once the underground system is operational. Officials estimate that the initial pilot route could serve around 13,000 passengers per day, with capacity growing significantly as later phases expand the system.The Dubai Loop aligns with broader smart-city goals, including reduced congestion, lower emissions and seamless integration with other public transport modes. By moving some commuting underground, the surface streets can be less crowded and more pedestrian-friendly.The first phase is budgeted at approximately AED 565 million (~$154 million) and is expected to commence construction in late 2026, following design and preparatory work. The full project, spanning the larger network, could cost around AED 2 billion (~$545 million) and is planned to be completed over three years.The tunnels themselves will be 3.6 metres in diameter, optimized for vehicle-based passenger shuttles, with The Boring Company’s proprietary fast and cost-effective tunnelling technology reducing disruption and construction time compared with traditional underground infrastructure.The Boring Company, founded by Elon Musk, has pioneered underground tunnelling projects in the US most notably the Las Vegas Loop system that shuttles passengers beneath the Las Vegas Convention Center. With the Dubai Loop, TBC expands its footprint internationally, bringing its vision of tunnel-based transport to a bustling global metropolis.Elon Musk’s own amplification of the project on social media underscores its high profile and signals confidence in its potential impact, even as it pushes the boundaries of what conventional urban transit looks like.Dubai’s embrace of the Dubai Loop reflects a broader shift toward future-focused urban mobility. While traditional mass transit systems like metro lines and buses remain essential, the Loop represents a complementary vision, which is rapid, point-to-point underground mobility that alleviates surface traffic and enhances convenience for residents and visitors alike.It also builds on Dubai’s track record of adopting pioneering technologies, from automated metro systems to autonomous taxis, positioning the emirate as a global testbed for tomorrow’s transport innovations. The official signing between RTA Dubai and The Boring Company to build the Dubai Loop marks a significant milestone in urban transportation.With construction set to begin in late 2026 on the pilot phase, this ambitious project could convert the emirate’s bustling streets into a more efficient, high-speed underground mobility network connecting major city hubs. Backed by strong leadership and global tech expertise, the Dubai Loop embodies Dubai’s bold vision of a smarter, faster and more sustainable future of urban mobility.","The Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) of Dubai has officially signed a contract with Elon Musk ’s The Boring Company to build the Dubai Loop. The pilot system with 6.4 km of tunnel and 4 stations will begin construction in late 2026. Officials estimate that the initial pilot route could serve around 13,000 passengers per day, with capacity growing significantly as later phases expand the system.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127907679,imgsize-39216,width-400,resizemode-4/dubai-signs-elon-musks-boring-company-to-build-futuristic-dubai-loop-revolutionising-urban-transport-beneath-the-city.jpg"

Saudi Arabia has introduced a new digital and regulatory system designed to bring order, traceability and credibility to the camel sector, marking a significant step in how the animals are identified, traded and managed across the Kingdom.The Camel Passport initiative, launched on Tuesday, creates an official identity for every registered camel, linking ownership, health records and breed information into a single, recognised framework that supports regulation, veterinary services and market credibility.The project was inaugurated by Deputy Minister of Environment, Water and Agriculture Mansour Al-Mushaiti and is part of the ministry’s work under the National Program for the Development of the Livestock and Fisheries Sector.According to the ministry, the initiative aims to unify regulatory and digital systems across the camel sector. By formally documenting camel data, ownership details, breeds and health records, it establishes an authorised reference that can be used for veterinary response, regulatory oversight and transparent market operations.The camel passport functions as a comprehensive identification document, ensuring that each animal can be accurately verified and tracked.It includes the following details:Additionally, the passport includes a dedicated vaccination record. This section documents veterinary immunisations and is officially certified with the name, signature and stamp of the attending veterinarian.The ministry said the initiative will play a central role in regulating sales and trading activities within the camel market. It will organise transport procedures, ownership transfers and official documentation, helping protect owners’ rights while increasing trust among buyers, sellers and other market participants.By creating a verified record for each camel, the system is expected to reduce disputes, improve traceability and bring greater clarity to commercial transactions.The camel passport is also expected to enhance the market value of camels by allowing pricing to be based on accurate and verifiable data, including health status, breed and lineage. This is expected to increase transparency in both local and international auctions.Beyond trade, the project will support strategic planning by generating reliable data on camel populations, broken down by age, gender, breed and colour. The ministry said this information will help guide national livestock distribution, improve breeding efficiency through genetic performance analysis and support programmes aimed at improving local camel breeds.Together, these measures position the camel passport as a foundational tool for modernising the sector while preserving its economic and cultural importance in Saudi Arabia.","The Camel Passport initiative, launched on Tuesday, creates an official identity for every registered camel.
