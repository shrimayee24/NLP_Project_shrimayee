NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishnakar on Thursday addressed the attack on Indian consulate in San Francisco, which took place in 2023, and called it a ""very serious matter"". He added that the country expected accountability from the US in the matter.""The arson attack on our consulate in San Francisco is a very, very serious matter, and it is something for which we expect accountability. We would like to see that people who did it are held responsible,"" Jaishankar said at a press conference in Washington DC.On March 19, 2023, the Consulate General of India in San Francisco faced a series of attacks. Early in the morning, assailants attempted to set the consulate building on fire by sprinkling inflammable substances.Later that day, a group of attackers engaged in criminal trespass, vandalized public property, and targeted consulate officials, escalating the severity of the incident.The video, which surfaced on social media, showed suspected pro-Khalistani protestors gathered outside the Indian Consulate, shouting slogans and heckling staff as they exited the diplomatic mission.Three months later, in July, Khalistan extremists made another attempt to set the Consulate on fire. Following this incident, an investigation was launched.The attack was condemned by the US as ""criminal offence"".Later that year, the Federal Bureau of Investigation had assured the National Investigative agency that it was 'aggressively' looking into the attack."," External affairs minister S Jaishankar addressed the attack on Indian consulate in San Francisco, which took place in 2023.

One of the issues secretary of state Marco Rubio raised with EAM S Jaishankar was irregular migration , underlining the Trump administration’s position on the issue. Jaishankar said India’s position on legal mobility and illegal migration has been consistent with all countries and “US is no exception”.“We have always taken the view that if there are any of our citizens who are not here legally and if you are sure that they are our citizens, we’ve always been open to their legitimate return. So, it’s not a position unique to the US. We have been consistent, we have been very principled about it and that remains our position, and I conveyed that very clearly to secretary Rubio,” Jaishankar said at a press meet. He warned against quoting numbers, saying India first has to validate that the individuals concerned are of Indian origin.During the meeting with Rubio, Jaishankar raised the issue of delay in visas for Indian nationals. He said the delay constrained people-to-people contacts that act as the very basis of the relationship. Jaishankar also said he discussed the Bangladesh situation with Rubio, but provided no details.","Jaishankar said India’s position on legal mobility and illegal migration has been consistent with all countries and ‘US is no exception’ He warned against quoting numbers, saying India first has to validate that the individuals concerned are of Indian origin.

NEW DELHI: Can the country return to elections with ballot paper? What’s the cost-benefit of one-nation-one-election (ONOE)? How many phases will be required to hold nationwide simultaneous elections and what will be the effect of model code of conduct imposed for such polls on the economy, foreign direct investment and development? How does the expenditure on polls get reduced with ONOE, particularly if 10 states were to have mid-term polls ?These are among the nearly 40 queries raised by MPs in the joint parliamentary committee studying the Constitution (One Hundred and Twenty-Ninth Amendment) Bill, 2024 and the Union Territories Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2024, proposing simultaneous Lok Sabha and state assembly elections, followed by local body polls in the next 100 days. The questions have now been forwarded by law ministry to Election Commission for inputs, sources told TOI on Wednesday.A senior EC official told TOI that the poll panel will submit its response “in due time”. In any case, the official added, EC has fielded most of these queries in its earlier inputs to law ministry and the ONOE panel led by former President Ram Nath Kovind. The poll panel had, during its consultations earlier with the Kovind panel, given a detailed estimate of the EVMs/VVPATs, manpower, polling stations and budget required to hold simultaneous elections, while insisting on suitable lead time to hold simultaneous polls. “We will see what more is to be shared,” said the official.Among the important questions is how expenditure on elections will get reduced with simultaneous polls. “The stress seems to be on quantifying the savings,” said an officer.Besides seeking a cost-benefit analysis, the MPs want a comparison of expenses on holding separate and simultaneous Lok Sabha and assembly polls.An estimate of additional resources, EVMs and manpower required to hold simultaneous polls has also been sought. More pinpointed queries include the cost of simultaneous polls as a share of GDP.Inputs have also been sought from EC on an MP’s query regarding the cost of diverting govt staff for poll-related training, which starts a year ahead of polls, and election duties, and who will bear the losses on account of their absence from normal duty.Among the non-finance questions are how the municipal and panchayat polls will be tied with parliamentary and assembly polls. A commission official however said holding local body polls is not its mandate. Another query relates to whether using two EVMs in a polling station will pose a problem and what if the EVM for Lok Sabha poll and assembly poll record different voting figures; an EC official said this is the normal practice when state assembly polls are held along with general election to Lok Sabha.Yet another interesting query that the law ministry has conveyed to EC is as to why the One-Nation-One-Election Bill does not include an amendment to give model code of conduct legal sanctity, as recommended earlier by National Commission on Working of the Constitution.","Nearly 40 queries raised by MPs in joint parliamentary committee studying Constitution (One Hundred and Twenty-Ninth Amendment) Bill, 2024.

At Kumbh mela, Russian, Ukrainian seers hold prayers for world peace

PRAYAGRAJ: Spirituality knows no boundaries. Despite Russia and Ukraine being embroiled in a bloody war for 1,000 days, two spiritual leaders, Swami Vishnudevananda Giriji Maharaj from Ukraine, and Ananda Lila Mata from Russia, have been giving sermons on love, peace and compassion from the same platform at the Maha Kumbh Mela.They have been conducting daily sessions at Pilot Baba’s camp in Sector 18 where devotees from various parts of the world gather to listen to their teachings. More than 70 people from Ukraine and Russia are living together at the camp, and 100 more are expected to arrive.Their sermons often include traditional prayers and discussions about applying spirituality in daily life. And both share personal experiences from their countries while emphasising the universal nature of spiritual truth.Giriji Maharaj, formerly Valeriy, is from Kharkiv city in northeast Ukraine and now the Mahamandaleshwar of Juna Akhara. He told TOI, “My message for world peace is expressed in two words: “Loka Sangraham” (universal good) and “Arru Paddai” (universal enlightenment). We must remember the mantra ‘lokah samastah sukhino bhavantu’, which seeks the good and happiness of all living beings. Humanity lacks ‘sattva energy’. When sattva energy spreads through meditation in a society, nation and on earth, the world begins to change for the better. And the stage is set for the arrival of Satya Yuga, the Golden Age.”Ananda Mata, formerly Olga, is from Nizhny Novgorod in western Russia. “This is my fifth visit to Kumbh Mela. The first time I came here was at the invitation of Mahamandaleshwar Pilot Babaji. In 2010, I accepted the status of Mahamandaleshwar and since then I have come to almost every Kumbh Mela,” she said.“Kumbh Mela is a unique opportunity to immerse yourself in the very heart of the sadhu culture and spread the message of peace. Many saints come to the Kumbh Mela to be a part of this festival of blessings. It is also a way for thousands of people to purify their karma and their consciousness. I come here to meet my students from all over the world, to show them the culture of Sanatan Dharma, to convey the teachings of Advaita Vedanta , Shaivism, yoga, and meditation,” Ananda Mata added.“When people from Russia and Ukraine sit together in harmony it sets an example of how spiritual pursuit can unite people beyond national identities,” she said. Both Giriji Maharaj and Ananda Mata conduct special prayers for world peace and healing of nations affected by war. Their message has special resonance given the bloody conflict their countries have been engaged in, which has caused huge loss of lives on both sides and widespread destruction in Ukraine.","Two spiritual leaders from Russia and Ukraine have been giving sermons at the Maha Kumbh Mela.

Message to China: Quad opposes unilateral acts to forcibly alter status quo,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/message-to-china-quad-opposes-unilateral-acts-to-forcibly-alter-status-quo/articleshow/117469337.cms,"Foreign minister S Jaishankar, flanked by counterparts Iwaya Takeshi (Japan), Marco Rubio (US) and Penny Wong (Australia), in Washington DC on Tuesday

Timing of meet shows priority member-states attach to Quad: EAM Jaishankar

NEW DELHI: Hours after the inauguration of US President Donald Trump, Quad nations sent out a clear message to China in the form of a joint statement, in which their foreign ministers strongly opposed any unilateral actions that seek to change the status quo by force or coercion.While this formulation is not new, it’s significant, coming as it does amid fears in the Indo-Pacific about the potentially erratic nature of President Trump’s foreign policy that have been exacerbated by his recent courting of his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping.The Quad ministers, according to the joint statement, reaffirmed their commitment to strengthening a free and open Indo-Pacific where the rule of law, democratic values , sovereignty, and territorial integrity are upheld and defended. If there was any doubt about who these messages were intended for in the first meeting of the group after Trump’s return as President, Japan laid it to rest by specifically mentioning in its own readout East and South China Seas where China’s territorial claims remain a major source of friction.“Our four nations maintain our conviction that international law, economic opportunity , peace, stability and security in all domains, including the maritime domain underpin the development and prosperity of the peoples of the Indo-Pacific,” said Quad joint statement. Significantly, it also committed to regular meetings between the foreign ministers and the proposed summit in India later this year.“We are committed to strengthening regional maritime, economic, and technology security in the face of increasing threats, as well as promoting reliable and resilient supply chains,” said the joint statement.The timing of the Quad meeting is especially significant for countries like India and Japan as it suggests the Trump administration , the President’s recent overtures for a deal with China notwithstanding, will remain committed to working jointly with other partners in a way that could blunt Chinese aggression. Jaishankar said that the timing underlined the priority that member-states attach to Quad. “The meeting today sends a clear message that in an uncertain and volatile world, Quad will continue to be a force for global good,’’ he said in a post on X. PM Narendra Modi had described Quad as a force for global good, participating in the first in-person summit in 2021.While Quad was upgraded to the summit level under Trump’s predecessor Joe Biden, Trump is credited with reviving the mechanism under his first term as President. The Quad officials met for the first time in 2007 but it was only in 2019, on the margins of UNGA in New York, that the foreign ministers met for the first time. Speaking on Trump’s concerns about alliances and burden-sharing, Jaishankar had said last month these don’t apply to Quad as “everybody pays their fair share’’.Quad sees itself as harnessing the collective strengths and resources of Australia, India, Japan and the US, from govts to the private sector to people-to-people relationships, to support the region’s “sustainable development, stability, and prosperity by delivering tangible benefits to the people of the Indo-Pacific”. So it’s like everybody goes for dinner and you split the bill, and everybody thinks it’s the right thing to do,’’ Jaishankar had said.",Quad nations sent out a clear message to China in the form of a joint statement.

Assam govt gets 6 weeks to file compliance affidavit

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Wednesday pulled up the Assam government for not explaining why foreign nationals were being kept in detention centres and not being deported to their country and asked the chief secretary to appear before it through virtual mode on the next date of hearing with an explanation.A bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and N Kotiswar Singh said the fundamental right to life was not confined only to citizens but all people, including foreigners, and immediate steps should be taken to deport them to their country.The bench was hearing a case pertaining to 270 people in detention centres/transit camps in Assam. ""Time of six weeks was granted to the state to file compliance affidavit. We expected the state to put on record reasons for detaining 270 foreign nationals in the transit camps and details of the steps taken by the state govt for deporting the detenus,"" the bench said.Time of six weeks was granted to the state govt to file compliance affidavit. We expected the state to put on record reasons for detaining 270 foreign nationals in transit camps and details of steps taken by state govt for deporting the detenus.We find from the annexure to the affidavit that some of the foreigners are languishing in the camps for about 10 years and more. The affidavit does not give any justification for detaining 270 persons and, moreover, steps taken to deport them are not set out. This is a gross violation of orders of this court. We direct the chief secretary of Assam to remain present through VC and explain the non-compliance,” the top court said.The lawyer appearing for Assam told the bench the deportation process of illegal migrants took place through the Union govt. He said complete details of illegal migrants, including contact address, were to be provided by the state govt to the ministry of external affairs, which then verifies the identities of the migrants through diplomatic channels.Earlier, SC had directed Assam State Legal Services Authority to conduct visits at the Matia transit camp for foreigners to check the facility’s hygiene and food quality.",Supreme Court pulls up Assam government for not explaining why foreign nationals were being kept in detention centres.

BHOPAL: Actor Saif Ali Khan and other members of the Pataudi family are at risk of losing ancestral properties in MP worth several thousand crores after 94 of 131 such assets bequeathed by his great-grandfather and the last Nawab of Bhopal, Hamidullah Khan , were found to be within the ambit of “enemy property” during a verification process spanning nine years.Custodian of Enemy Property for India (CEPI), which was assigned the task of identifying and assessing these properties in accordance with the Enemy Property Act of 1968, provided the status of the investigation in its Jan 3 response to an RTI query.Enemy property refers to assets left behind in India by entities who migrated to countries designated as “enemy nations” during times of conflict. In this case, the dispute stems from the heir to the Bhopal estate , Abida Sultan , relocating to Pakistan three years after Partition. The last Nawab’s properties then passed to his other daughter Sajida Sultan, whose son Mansur Ali Khan ‘Tiger’ Pataudi is Saif’s father.In 2015, CEPI sent a notice to the MP govt, vesting control of all properties of ""Gowhar-i-Taj"" Abida Sultan. Until February 2017, CEPI cited 88 immovable properties in MP as being part of the “enemy” estate. The Pataudis moved court against the notice soon after.The recent RTI reply valued the cumulative 113.6 acres of immovable assets at Rs 1,796 crore.CEPI provided details of the assessment barely three weeks after Madhya Pradesh high court instructed Saif and his mother, actor Sharmila Tagore, to approach the ministry of home affairs' appellate authority for information regarding the assets vested as ""enemy property"". The Pataudis didn't have any legal representation at the Dec 13 hearing.RTI petitioner Naresh Kadyan, who filed a query regarding the case in Aug 2023, questioned why CEPI hadn't listed the ""enemy properties"" linked to the last Nawab of Bhopal in the public domain all these years.","94 of 131 assets bequeathed by his great-grandfather and the last Nawab of Bhopal, Hamidullah Khan, found to be within the ambit of “enemy property’ The dispute stems from the heir to the B hopal estate relocating to Pakistan three years after Partition.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117468047,imgsize-73984,width-400,resizemode-4/117468047.jpg"

Use of Radar Technology to Overcome Cloud Cover Detailed Images of the Event Site

NEW DELHI: A radar imaging satellite operated by the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) has captured detailed images of the ongoing Maha Kumbh Mela 2025 in Prayagraj , Uttar Pradesh.The images, released by Isro, showcase the extensive infrastructure, including the layout of tent cities, roads, and numerous pontoon bridges constructed at the Sangam for the massive religious gathering.The high-resolution images were captured by EOS-04 (RISAT-1A), a ‘C’ band microwave satellite with all-weather imaging capability. Combining time-series images from 15 September 2023 (pre-event) and 29 December 2024 (infrastructure buildup), the satellite highlights the event's progressive development. Union Minister Hardeep Singh Puri shared some of these images on X, saying, ""The Indian Space Research Organisation has released stunning images of the Maha Kumbh Mela as seen from space.""ISRO’s National Remote Sensing Center (NRSC) in Hyderabad used the advanced radar technology to overcome cloud cover over Prayagraj and provide clear visuals. Dr Prakash Chauhan, Director of the NRSC, explained, “The radarsat was used as it could image the region through the cloud band that enveloped Prayagraj.” The Uttar Pradesh administration is reportedly leveraging these images to mitigate potential disasters and manage crowd control.Union minister of State for Science and Technology Jitendra Singh lauded the use of advanced technology at the event. ""These advanced technologies represent a paradigm shift in managing large-scale religious gatherings. The Mahakumbh Mela stands as a shining example of how technology and tradition can come together to create a cleaner, healthier future for all,"" he said.The Maha Kumbh, held every 12 years, is one of the world's largest spiritual events, attracting over 450 million devotees. The mela began on January 10, 2025, with over 1.60 crore devotees taking a holy dip at the Sangam on Makar Sankranti alone. The event will continue until February 26.The satellite images also captured progressive snapshots of the mela site — from its pre-event state in April 2024, through December 2024 as infrastructure developed, and into January 2025 as massive crowds gathered.","Isro satellite captures detailed images of Maha Kumbh Mela 2025 in Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh.

NEW DELHI: The governing BJP and opposition clashed over the plan to finalise the Waqf bill, with the joint parliamentary committee (JPC) announcing back-to-back meetings on Jan 24 and 25 to wind up its work, and the opposition demanding that the sessions be postponed by a week. BJP dubbed the opposition plea as a delaying tactic.The opposition said MPs did not get the required time to collect evidence and peruse material to finalise their arguments for a clause-by-clause discussion and for moving the amendments, and scheduling meetings just three days after the end of field tours will “defeat” the “purpose of the constitution of the JPC itself”.They demanded that the meetings be held on Jan 30-31. Opposition MPs, represented by DMK veteran A Raja, has shot off a protest letter to panel chairperson Jagdambika Pal, claiming the issue was discussed in the Lucknow JPC session on Jan 21 and he had reacted positively to their demand for postponement.Raja said rushing through the finalization of the bill without giving time to the opposition will raise doubts in the minds of people that while “secular fabrics of the Constitution embodied in its Preamble itself are endangered”, “due process in conducting JPC is not followed”.But government appeared ready to go ahead with the meetings, with BJP sources saying the report has to be submitted in the budget session. They added the bill will be passed as NDA allies have pledged their support to the final legislation.“We have held extensive consultations and a demand for extension seems a tactic to delay the tabling of the bill,” said BJP MP and JPC member Nishikant Dubey. Opposition said that since the JPC’s tours to Patna, Kolkata and Lucknow were completed on Jan 21, after which MPs dispersed to their constituencies/states, it was “strange the next dates of the sitting of the JPC were hurriedly announced without any formal discussion when the JPC was already on tour”.“The members are not in a position to recollect evidence/materials on a short notice, which are needed for moving the amendments and discussion,” Raja said. Pal said, “In the last six months, we have held 34 meetings in Delhi alone. I believe it will be a very good report... and a good law will be made to ensure that Waqf properties are used for their intended purposes.”",The governing BJP and opposition clashed over the plan to finalise the Waqf bill.

NEW DELHI: In a move to expand emergency health services , govt has decided to establish 24x7 primary health centres (PHCs) and first referral units (FRUs) across the country.As of March 2024, 12,348 PHCs have been converted to 24x7 services and 3,133 FRUs have been made operational, govt said. The fleet of mobile medical units (MMUs) has also expanded, with 1,424 MMUs now operating to ensure healthcare access in remote and under-served areas,” said an official, while briefing about the PM Modi-chaired Cabinet meeting on Wednesday to review progress under the National Health Mission (NHM).India has over 30,000 PHCs operational. The PHCs are established to provide primary care to a population of 30,000 in rural areas and 20,000 in hilly, tribal and desert areas.Dr Vinay Agarwal, of the Indian Medical , said making the PHCs functional 24x7 was a great move as it would help people, especially those living in rural areas, access emergency health services promptly. For example, in case of snakebite, deaths occur mostly because the patient can’t reach hospital in time. If medical intervention can be assured locally, at PHCs, it will help save many lives. Similarly, for maternal and child health , such a service is going to be a big boon.” Dr Aggarwal, however, stressed the need to maintain such facilities well, in terms of availability of required manpower, medicines, and other key equipment.A key achievement of NHM, govt said, has been the increase in human resources within the healthcare sector. “In the financial year 2021-22, NHM facilitated the engagement of 2.69 lakh additional healthcare workers, including general duty medical officers, specialists, staff nurses, ANMs, AYUSH doctors, allied healthcare workers, and public health managers.”","As of March 2024, 12,348 PHCs have been converted to 24x7 services and 3,133 FRUs have been made operational.

The health department is committed to checkmate such attempts,” Nadda said at a programme at Vigyan Bhawan .Launched on Jan 22, 2015, BBBP aims at addressing declining child sex ratio, prevent gender-biased sex-selective elimination , and promote survival, protection and education of the girl child The Annapurna Devi-led women and child development ministry highlighted that India’s sex ratio at birth has gone up from 918 in 2014-15 to 930 in 2023-24, as an indicator of progress. It also shared that gross enrolment ratio of girls at the secondary level has risen from 75.5% to 78%, and institutional deliveries have gone up from 61% to 97.3%. In addition, first-trimester antenatal care registrations have increased from 61% to 80.5%.Devi said, “BBBP’s achievements will be celebrated till International Women’s Day on March 8. We will organise special programmes to raise awareness about gender equality and challenge gender biases.”Meanwhile, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge on X asked, “Ten years of Beti Bachao, our three questions to Modi ji — Why did BJP adopt the policy of ‘save the criminals’ instead of ‘save the daughters’? When will the women of Manipur get justice? Whether it is the Dalit daughter of Hathras or the daughter of Unnao, or our champion female wrestler, why has BJP always protected criminals?”.With the government's flagship ‘Beti Bachao Beti Padhao (BBBP)’ programme completing 10 years, PM Narendra Modi on Wednesday said the initiative has been instrumental in overcoming gender biases and has created the right environment to ensure that the girl child has access to education and opportunities to achieve her dreams.Referring to the programme as a “movement”, Modi on X said over the past decade, it has become a “transformative, people-powered initiative and has drawn participation from people across all walks of life”.“Thanks to the dedicated efforts of the people and various community service organisations, ‘Beti Bachao Beti Padhao’ has achieved remarkable milestones,” he added.The PM said districts with historically low child sex ratios have reported significant improvements, and awareness campaigns have instilled a deeper sense of the importance of gender equality.","Beti Bachao initiative has helped overcome gender biases: PM Narendra Modi.

The operation of Shinkansen trains on the entire corridor — the foundation stone for which was laid in Sept 2017 — would be possible only by 2033, sources said.This became evident after the National High Speed Rail Corporation (NHRSCL) last week published the tender for the signalling system for running Vande Bharat trains, which are being developed as India’s indigenous bullet trains. As per the tender document, the successful bidder will have to design, manufacture, supply, install and maintain the signalling and train control system. This will be the European Train Control System (ETCS) Level-2, different from the Japanese DS-ATC signalling for Shinkansen trains.The contract period for ETCS-2 is seven years from the date of award of work. Sources said the deployment of ETCS-2 on the corridor will ensure utilisation of the infrastructure. The plan is to start commercial operations of Vande Bharat trains on this track in 2027.“There is no point in keeping this high capital-intensive project unutilised for want of Japanese trains. Even when the Vande Bharat trains are operational, the installation of the Japanese signalling system for Shinkansen trains can be carried out. The timeline for introduction of the E-10 series trains (an advanced version of bullet trains) in 2030 or later can be finalised once the trains meeting Indian conditions are made available,” a source said.As per the plan, once the Shinkansen trains are fully operational, the advanced versions of Vande Bharat trains and the ETCS would be shifted to other projects.Neither the railway ministry nor the NHSRCL respond to queries about the signalling tender and the timeline of Shinkansen train operation on this corridor. However, officials said they are confident of getting the best Japanese bullet trains for the project by 2030, and that the Vande Bharat trains, to be introduced as a stopgap arrangement, and would meet the expectation of passengers.","The railway ministry has invited bids for a signalling system that will allow Vande Bharat trains to run on this section.

'Foolproof': What EC said on EVM tampering allegations



'Why does he want it?' EC over blocking public access of CCTV footage of poll booths



NEW DELHI: Election Commission of India on Tuesday addressed concerns regarding wrongful additions and deletions of voters in the electoral roll and said that the allegations regarding the rigging Electronic Voting Machines were ""baseless.""Setting a poetic tone, the chief election commissioner Rajiv Kumar began with a shayari: "" Sab sawaal ahamiyat rakhte hai, jawaab toh banta hai; aadatan kalam band jawaab dete rahe, aaj rubaroo toh banta hain.Kya pata kal ho ya na hon, aaj jawab banta hai ( All questions hold importance; answers must follow; out of habit, we kept giving written replies, but today, face-to-face feels necessary; who knows if tomorrow will come or not, today, an answer is due).""The CEC, before announcing the dates of Delhi assembly elections, took the opportunity to offer clarifications on allegations, including EVM tampering , erratic changes in voter list and recent changes in rules by the poll body to prevent public inspection of certain electronic documents.Kumar refuted claims of manipulation in the electoral roll, categorically mentioning that no deletion is made without proper documentation, field verification, and providing the individual an opportunity to be heard.On addition of names to the electoral roll, Kumar said, ""Regular meetings are held with the representatives of political parties, who have the right to appoint booth-level agents (BLAs). Weekly lists of claims and objections are shared, and both draft and final rolls are published on the Election Commission's website. Polling station rationalisation is also carried out with the consultation of all the stakeholders.""Regarding deletion of names from the list, he said, ""Mandatory field verification is conducted by the BLOs, and in cases where deletions exceed 2 per cent of a polling station's voter list, cross-verification is done. Deletions due to death require a certified death certificate, and a seven-day window is provided for objections after notices are published online. Also, the affected voters are given the opportunity for a personal hearing before their names are removed.""""Where every vote matters, raising doubts about deletion of thousands of names without evidence is misleading. The processes we follow leave no room for manipulation,"" he said.He added that political parties were involved at each and every stage of voter list preparation with full disclosure and opportunity to object.CEC said that it was not possible to change the voter turnout and said that it was ""misleading to compare final VTR with 5pm data.""""...It is impossible to change voter turnout...Some polling parties report at midnight or the next day. Form 17C is matched before counting. There is nothing which VTR does not explain. It explains fully,"" he said.Addressing the EVM issue, CEC said, ""There is no evidence of unreliability or any drawback in the EVM... There is no question of introducing a virus or bug in the EVM. There is no question of invalid votes in the EVM. No rigging is possible. High courts and the Supreme Court are continuously saying this in different judgments... What else can be said? EVMs are foolproof devices for counting. Allegations of tampering are baseless. We are speaking now because we don't speak when elections are on.""Kumar also cited court rulings at multiple occasions and said that ""courts have ruled on 42 occasions that EVMs are not hackable, allegations of tampering totally baseless.""""This is aimed at derailing the electoral process,"" he added.Further, he said that no discrepancies had been found between votes counted through Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) and Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) slips,"" he said.""Let me tell the nation today. After the Supreme Court mandated in 2019 that five VVPATs must be counted from each assembly constituency, over 67,000 VVPATs have been checked. ""This translates to more than 4.5 crore (VVPAT) slips being verified. And let me assure you that not even the difference of one vote has been found with the new machines since 2019,"" he added.Kumar defended the recent amendment to election rules restricting public access to CCTV footage from polling booths, citing the need to safeguard voter privacy and prevent misuse of data to create false narratives.""Why does he want it? Let us ask this question from the person who wants it,"" Kumar asked as he addressed the reason why the poll body had decided to block public access to CCTV footages of poll booths.The CEC explained that the poll authority has evidence showing how such data could be exploited for machine learning and AI to craft deceptive narratives. He cautioned that even fact-checkers might struggle to distinguish between genuine and AI-generated videos of polling stations.The government, acting on the Election Commission's recommendation, amended the rules last month to limit public inspection of certain electronic documents, including polling station CCTV footage, to prevent potential abuse.This comes amidst the opposition raising concerns regarding irregularities in electoral processes, with AAP national convenor Arvind Kejriwal recently accusing BJP of tampering with voters' lists in Delhi. The former CM had alleged that there was an ""unusual increase"" in voter list modifications, including both removals and additions, specifically in New Delhi constituency.Congress had also raised similar concerns during Maharashtra and Haryana assembly elections, with Mallikarjun Kharge demanding ballot papers instead of EVMs.Assembly elections in Delhi are set to take place in a single phase on February 5.

American Birthright citizenship curtailed even for legal immigrants: Over 1 million Indians in green card queue impacted,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/citizenship-by-birth-curtailed-even-for-legal-immigrants-over-1-million-indians-in-green-card-queue-impacted/articleshow/117419508.cms,"Poll What’s Your Biggest Concern About the Recent Executive Order? Legal Challenges and Constitutionality Impact on Legal Immigrants

Trump signs executive order ending birthright citizenship, other immigration actions

President Donald Trump’s executive order (EO) - ‘Protecting the meaning and value of American citizenship ,’ has left the Indian diaspora stunned. Many believed that Trump’s speeches during his campaign trail of ending ‘ citizenship by birth ’ would apply only to children of illegal immigrants. The overarching belief of many Indian families was that documented (legal) immigrants like the H-1B holders, or those on other work visas like the L (intra-company) visa, or even a F (student) visa, would not be impacted. They are in for a rude shock.Over a million Indians who are in a decades-long queue for an employment-linked green card will be impacted going forward, as a child born in a family (thirty days from the date of the EO) where the mother is here lawfully but temporarily (eg: as a visitor or on a non-immigrant visa – be it a dependent visa like H-4 or even a work visa) and the ‘father’ is not a green card holder or US citizen will not get automatic American citizenship.The Times of India, in its edition dated November 7, 2024, was one of the few newspapers to correctly predict this plan of action. We had said, that if the EO is signed, it would spell a huge set-back for the Indian diaspora, as at least one parent would be required to be a US citizen or green card holder.According to an analysis of the US Census (2022) done by Pew Research, the US was home to about 4.8 Indian Americans, of whom 34% or 1.6 million were born in the US (and became American citizens by virtue of birth).The proposed plan of action is now a reality. Currently, those children who are not born in the US, and whose families are caught in the decades long green card backlog have to self deport on turning 21 or have to opt for another visa – say an international student visa. Citizenship by birth at least gave Indian couples waiting endless in queue for a green card a breather, If their child was born on American soil.Trump’s executive order points out that the 14th Amendment has never been interpreted to extend citizenship universally to everyone born within the US. It has always excluded from birthright citizenship persons who were born in the US but not ‘subject to the jurisdiction thereof.’In the context of legal immigrants, it adds: “The privilege of US citizenship does not automatically extend to persons born in the US: When the mother’s presence in the US at the time of said person’s birth was lawful but temporary (such as, but not limited to, visiting the US under the auspices of the Visa Waiver Program or visiting on a student, work, or tourist visa) and the father was not a US citizen or lawful permanent resident (which means a green card holder) at the time of said person’s birth.”According to immigration attorneys ‘citizenship by birth’ is enshrined in the 14th amendment to the US constitution. The first lawsuit challenging this executive order has been filed by immigration right activists such as the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and others.Cyrus D. Mehta, New York based immigration attorney told TOI: “If both parents are in the US in a non-immigrant status, such as in H-1B and H-4 (dependant visa) status, under Trump’s EO the State Department will not issue a US passport to the child as they are no longer regarded as ‘subject to the jurisdiction thereof’. This EO will obviously be challenged in court, but I can see the Trump administration taking this all the way to the Supreme Court in the hope that the majority of conservative justices could agree with Trump’s new interpretation of the 14th Amendment.”“If the courts agree with Trump’s interpretation, going forward children of H-1B and H-4 non-immigrants who are born in the US, will not be recognized as US citizens. There is a ripple impact. Many Indians are caught in 100 year employment-linked green card backlogs, and so their only hope was for their child born in the US to sponsor them, when he/she attained 21 years. Now this will not be possible”Also read: Hiring freeze could lead to immigration processing delays, say experts Greg Siskind, co-founder of Siskin Susser, an immigration law firm, said: “The unconstitutionality of this is stunning. The term ‘subject to the jurisdiction thereof’ was never intended to apply to those targeted by the EO. It was meant to apply to diplomats who are not subject to the jurisdiction of the US. This is going to be litigated and I predict it will be enjoined before it is effective in 30 days. But obviously there's no guarantees here,”Fiona McEntee also pointed out the gender-play here, “And yes, the EO uses the terms father and mother because obviously every child is born into a family with a mother and father!!!!”Ashwin Sharma, immigration attorney told TOI, “The phrase ‘subject to the jurisdiction thereof’ has been consistently interpreted to include nearly all individuals born on US soil, irrespective of their parents’ immigration status, other than children of enemy occupiers or diplomats. A landmark Supreme Court case reaffirmed this interpretation, granting citizenship to a child born in the US to Chinese immigrant parents who were not US citizens. This decision established a precedent which leaves little room for reinterpretation.”The fate of children who have non-citizen, non-green card holder parents now vests with the US courts.","Many believed that Trump’s speeches during his campaign trail of ending ‘ citizenship by birth ’ would apply only to children of illegal immigrants. The overarching belief of many Indian families was that documented (legal) immigrants like the H-1B holders, or those on other work visas like the L (intra-company) visa, or even a F (student) visas, would not be impacted.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117419783,imgsize-919110,width-400,resizemode-4/117419783.jpg"

Police said that before the attack on Saif, Shariful walked 90 minutes to Bandra in the intervening night of Jan 15-16. ""He carried housebreaking tools like a screwdriver, hammer, and hacksaw blade, which he had bought a few days prior. The knife he later used to attack the actor, he had stolen from the Thane restaurant where he used to work,"" said an officer. ""After the crime, he was in Bandra-Khar for hours before taking a train to Dadar. He was unaware till then that he had stabbed a famous film actor. He told us during questioning that his attack on Saif was unplanned.""The police tracked Shariful after Jitendra Pandey provided his Worli location and phone number.

""He said his friends and family members often told him that he looked like Shah Rukh Khan. That would puff him up,"" the officer said.Police have seized Shariful's cellphone, cap, scarf and the shirt he changed after the crime. The items have been sent to the forensics lab.

Lakers legend Magic Johnson is reportedly exploring a role in NBA expansion as part of an ownership group. According to reports, Johnson could join efforts to bring a new team to Las Vegas or Kansas City. His involvement would be a significant step for the Hall of Famer who has been a successful businessman following his retirement from the league. While the legendary NBA star already has his stakes in sports ventures, the new ownership of an NBA team would bring him back to the league in a new role. Magic Johnson is widely regarded as one of the most successful athletes in business after his playing days. Along with his various business ventures, he has stakes in teams like the Los Angeles Dodgers, Washington Commanders, and LAFC.However, owning an NBA team has never been on Johnson’s radar, at least not until now. Despite his love for the Lakers, Johnson previously teased that the New York Knicks would be his top choice if given the chance.Now, that might be changing. Reports suggest Johnson could join an ownership group for an NBA expansion team in either Las Vegas or Kansas City. According to the latest report by DailyMail.Com, the 1.6 billion rich (according to Forbes’ Real Time Net Worth) NBA legend is considering joining the group of owners for the NBA’s franchise expansion.“Several investment groups in Las Vegas are interested in partnering with him. His extensive experience in sports ownership and his business acumen positions him as a formidable candidate,” Jack Bezants of The Daily Mail reported about Johnson’s potential move.The NBA Hall of Famer’s return to the league with the new league has sparked conversation among fans. Additionally, Lakers legend LeBron James previously shared his interest in bringing a new team to Las Vegas. The conversations surrounding the new team shows positive pathways for the beginning of a Las Vegas franchise in the league. As it is being considered, many investors are looking to own their share including the two Lakers legends.“It just makes sense. Obviously you have the Raiders here. You have the Knights here. You have the Aces here. You got F1 coming very soon. All-Star Weekend has been here a few times, you got the NBA Summer League that’s very popular,” James said (via: Spectrum SportsNet).He went on to add, “Sports is here and I think adding an NBA franchise here would just add to the momentum that’s going on in this town. It’s an attraction. You don’t have to worry about getting fan support, nothing like that. They show every single time, every year, every summer, like you said even if its USA Basketball or the NBA coming here for Summer League whatever the case may be. I think it’s only a matter of time, and I hope I’m part of that time.”Also Read: LA Clippers fan who called out LeBron James ends up embarrassed in front of a full crowd If the Los Vegas NBA team gets a green light, the addition of two Lakers legends would make the team’s inception year interesting. James is still active in the league with the Lakers but the 40-year-old may hang up his basketball sneakers to join the new business venture in the NBA.",Lakers legend Magic Johnson is reportedly exploring a role in NBA expansion as part of an ownership group.

Stock market recommendations : According to Aakash K Hindocha, Deputy Vice President - WM Research, Nuvama Professional Clients Group, Bajaj Finserv , Muthoot Finance , and ABDL are the top stock picks for today. Here’s his view on Nifty, Bank Nifty and the top stock picks for January 23, 2025:Pressure on Nifty eased out in the last hour of trade after it failed to break its previous day’s low despite a selloff in the broader market. After closing at seven month low on Tuesday - Nifty has shown exhaustion of sellers near the 23k mark and a range bound trade between 23000 – 23300 can be seen for the rest of this week. A huge medium term support is being developed near 22800 – 22650 wherein a five year upward trendline support has emerged on weekly charts.Index recovered close to 700 points from its intraday lows as an index heavyweight reported better than expected numbers. Trading above 48850 on spot levels would negate the short term bearish flag formation on hourly charts of Bank Nifty. Support has now got developed at 48000 levels on the index while a round of short covering could be seen above 48850 for 500-700 point upside.An unusual buying interest is seen in Bajaj Finserv from the start of this calendar year wherein the stock is up 11% so far in a matter of 3 weeks compared to a 2-4% downtick on Nifty and Bank Nifty. Bajaj Finserv has claimed a 10 week high closing on Wednesday along with a bullish flag breakout on daily charts. This can allow the ongoing inflow momentum to continue for another 5-7% upside.Another stock exhibiting relative strength to the peer group and overall market is less than 5% away to reclaim its all-time highs. A fresh bullish flag breakout is seen on daily charts of the scrip which now opens doors to fresh all time high on charts. Given the tailwind expected in this sector ahead of the budget due next week, charts suggest a reclamation of new all-time high in the next 8-10 trading days.Stock has been outperforming broader markets as well as its peers for the past 8 weeks now, with Nifty and broader indices remaining at the same level seen in end of November 2024, the stock has seen a rise of +25% from its level seen in end of November 2024 signifying its relative strength to peer group and overall market. Currently just below 385 odd levels, the stock has taken support multiple times in the past 4-5 weeks now and the same is likely to hold going forward. A quick 8-10% reversal rally cannot be ruled out from this set up on charts.","Aakash K Hindocha, Deputy Vice President - WM Research, Nuvama Professional Clients Group, Bajaj Finserv, Muthoot Finance, and ABDL are the top stock picks for today. Here’s his view on Nifty, Bank Nifty and the topStock picks for January 23, 2025.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117473027,imgsize-95290,width-400,resizemode-4/117473027.jpg"

Melania Trump Reveals If Son Barron Will Live at White House

Barron Trump , the 18-year-old son of Donald and Melania, is an impressive 6 feet 9 inches tall, which has led to comparisons with NBA great LeBron James . His profile has been on the rise, especially with Donald Trump ’s recent political success in winning the 2024 presidential election , marking his return for a non-consecutive second term as the 47th President of the United States.Barron Trump, born on March 20, 2006, in New York City, has always been in the spotlight for his impressive height. By 2017, he was already matching his mom, Melania Trump , who is 5 feet 11 inches tall. Fast forward to his high school graduation in May 2024 from Oxbridge Academy in West Palm Beach, Florida, and he had shot up to 6 feet 7 inches.By November 2024, he was reported to be an astonishing 6 feet 9 inches tall, the same height as NBA superstar LeBron James.LeBron James, born on December 30, 1984, in Akron, Ohio, is often seen as one of the greatest basketball players in history. Standing tall at 6 feet 9 inches and weighing in at 250 pounds, his impressive combination of size, strength, and athleticism has been crucial to his legendary career.He entered the NBA straight from high school in 2003 and has since earned a bunch of accolades, including four NBA titles and four MVP awards.Barron Trump's height has become a hot topic online, especially on Google and Twitter. Users are making comparisons to LeBron James, who is also the same height, and it’s created quite a stir. This surprising similarity has led to a wave of memes and discussions, showcasing the public's curiosity about the youngest Trump.In a June 2024 chat with social media sensation Logan Paul, former President Donald Trump jokingly commented on his son's height, saying, ""He's a big boy. Six foot 9. I couldn't get him to play basketball. I play soccer, he's a good athlete."" Moreover, in his book ""Siege: Trump Under Fire,"" journalist Michael Wolff claimed that Donald Trump feels envious of his son Barron's height, which has led to some friction between them.Barron Trump started his freshman year at New York University's Stern School of Business in September 2024, opting for a different route than his family, who typically go to the University of Pennsylvania or Georgetown. He’s staying at Trump Tower in Midtown Manhattan, pretty close to the NYU campus.Both Barron Trump and LeBron James are 6 feet 9 inches tall, but their journeys are worlds apart. LeBron has channeled his height into a stellar basketball career, while Barron, now 18, is just kicking off his academic path in business at NYU.It's pretty interesting how they both have the same height, showing that people with similar looks can take different routes and still find success in all sorts of areas.Also Read : “I’ve actually seriously considered it”: LeBron James was inches away from debuting in the NFL in a major career changing decision","Barron Trump was born on March 20, 2006, in New York City.

U Subba Rao, GM, ICF Chennai

What’s the update on NaMo Bharat trains, also called Vande Metro?

How many more Vande Bharat trains are in the pipeline?

Indian Railways is looking to manufacture its first bullet train. Tell us about the high-speed train project

Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw has said that 50 new Amrit Bharat trains will be manufactured…

Vande Bharat sleeper is a sleeper version of the Vande Bharat. We are going to produce a total 10 of these trains which will be 16 coach long. We are producing this in collaboration with BEML and the first prototype rake has already been dispatched from ICF after modifications & corrections for conducting field trials.An oscillation trial was conducted between Mahoba and Khajuraho section of North Central Railway at a maximum test speed of 115 kmph. Further detailed oscillation trial run at maximum speed of 180 kmph was conducted between Nagda, Kota and Sawai Madhopur section of West Central Railway.A lot of extensive trials and tests for the emergency braking system and electrical functioning tests were conducted for riding comfort. The train has been tested at 180 kmph and the operational speed will be 160 kmph. I expect that in this fiscal year the train will be ready for its journey.In terms of comparison with Rajdhani Express trains, the riding comfort will be much better. It will be faster, it has a potential to travel at 160 kmph, and Vande Bharat trains have faster acceleration and deceleration so it picks up speed very fast. In the same section, the average speed of Vande Bharat train will be much higher than any other train.Also Check | Vande Bharat sleeper hits 180 kmph during trials! Check viral video of new Indian Railways train better than Rajdhani Express The interiors, furnishings are much better, they are really up to the mark. Many more passenger friendly features are there, so that’s how it will be different from Rajdhani Express trains.This train has 16 coaches right now and the route will be decided by the Railway Board. We have also got orders for 24 car length trains which ICF will be manufacturing,The first tranche of 16 coach trains will be manufactured by BEML and later on ICF will be manufacturing the 24 coach length trains, and that will take 2 years from now for the first prototype to come out.NaMo Bharat trains are fully air-conditioned with one toilet per coach which is basically for day travel. The first rake was a prototype. We don’t have anything in the production pipeline as of now, but we have got orders for 7 more trains. We have already floated tenders for propulsion systems. My estimate is that in the next financial year these 7 trains will be produced.We have so far produced 81 trains of version 2. Earlier two rakes of Version 1 were rolled out in 2018 and 2019. We have got an order for a total of 97 trains, my estimate is that this year we will be able to produce 6 more trains.We were rolling out 8 car trains but because of the popularity of Vande Bharat, we have been asked to produce longer 20 car trains now. That is the reason there is a slight delay in rolling out new Vande Bharat trains, however the coach production number remains on track though.Also Read | Railway Budget 2025: Indian Railways to focus on modern trains, upgraded stations & tracks - details here The new high-speed trains will be of the same standard as bullet trains. The definition of a high speed train is beyond 250 kmph - the aerodynamics change at that speed - noise insulation is important at that speed. There are a lot of technical issues involved. We are looking to invite technology bottoms up.ICF will be working with BEML for production of two 8 car bullet trains. The new standard gauge bullet train will be tested on the Ahmedabad-Mumbai bullet train corridor route.In the future a lot of high-speed rail corridors may come up in India, so Indian Railways is trying to be future ready. The modalities of how to make the train are yet to be worked out. These will be 8 coach AC chair car trains.Also Read | Faster train travel! One-fifth of Indian Railways tracks can now handle 130 kmph train speeds We have an order for 50 Amrit Bharat trains, 25 of these will be manufactured by ICF and 25 by RCF Kapurthala. These are 22 coach trains and there will be a pantry car as well with a mix of general and second class coaches.We are targeting 6 Amrit Bharat trains this fiscal year which will be improved versions of the prototypes that were launched earlier. RCF is also likely to roll out some Amrit Bharat trains this fiscal year.","Vande Bharat sleeper will be much better than Rajdhani Express trains in terms of speed and ride comfort, says Subba Rao, General Manager of Integral Coach Factory (ICF) Rao shares the latest update on the Vande Bharat, NaMo Bharat and Amrit Bharat trains.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117451409,imgsize-95176,width-400,resizemode-4/117451409.jpg"

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares.

There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Trump administration blocks many health agency reports and online content,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-administration-blocks-many-health-agency-reports-and-online-content/articleshow/117472171.cms,"Donald Trump (File photo)

The Trump administration has implemented a temporary suspension on federal health agency communications with the public until the month's end.According to a memorandum accessed by The Associated Press, Dorothy Fink, acting secretary in the Department of Health and Human Services, instructed agency leaders to halt regulations, guidance, announcements, press releases, social media posts and website posts pending approval from a political appointee. ""As the new Administration considers its plan for managing the federal policy and public communications processes, it is important that the President’s appointees and designees have the opportunity to review and approve any regulations, guidance documents, and other public documents and communications (including social media),” said Fink.The pause, which is in effect through February 1, also applies to anything intended to be published in the Federal Register, where the executive branch communicates rules and regulations, and the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention scientific publication. Agencies subject to the directive from the department of health and human services include the CDC, the national institutes of health, and the food and drug administration.""The executive branch is a hierarchy,"" Steven Grossman, who now consults for food and drug companies, said in an email. ""Whether stated publicly or not, every new administration wants important commitments and positions to wait until new teams are in place and some semblance of hierarchy restored.""Ali Khan, a former CDC outbreak investigator who is now dean of the University of Nebraska's public health college, said that a pause is reasonable as a changing executive branch takes steps to become coordinated. ""The only concern would be is if this is a prelude to going back to a prior approach of silencing the agencies around a political narrative,"" he added.Peter Lurie, president of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, said that the communications pause could threaten public safety, as Americans depend on timely information from the CDC, the FDA, and other agencies to avoid foodborne illnesses and stay aware of other health issues. ""When it comes to stopping outbreaks, every second counts. Confusion around the vaguely worded gag order is likely to lead to unnecessary delay in publishing urgent public alerts during active outbreaks,"" Lurie said in a statement.Jeffrey Klausner, a University of Southern California public health expert, echoed these concerns. ""Local health officials and doctors depend on the CDC to get disease updates, timely prevention, testing and treatment guidelines and information about outbreaks,"" he wrote in an email. ""Shutting down public health communication stops a basic function of public health. Imagine if the government turned off fire sirens or other warning systems.""During his first term also, President Donald Trump 's political appointees tried to gain control over the CDC's MMWR journal, which had published information about the Covid-19 pandemic that conflicted with messaging from the White House.According to the current memo, some exceptions would be made for communications affecting ""critical health, safety, environmental, financial or nation security functions"", but those would still be subject to review. The FDA has posted notices about warning letters sent to companies and a drug safety notice on Tuesday and Wednesday.This comes after Trump signed an executive order on Day 1 of his presidency pulling US out of the WHO, citing the organization's handling of the Covid-19 pandemic and China's influence over the body.","Trump administration has implemented a temporary suspension on federal health agency communications with the public until the month's end.

Hundreds to get married today as Thailand's same-sex marriage law comes into effect,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/hundreds-to-get-married-as-thailands-same-sex-marriage-law-comes-into-effect/articleshow/117472032.cms,"200 couples to tie knot

Pioneering equality in Asia

Looking ahead: Advocacy for trans rights

Hundreds of same-sex couples are set to tie the knot on Thursday as Thailand officially becomes the first Southeast Asian nation to recognise marriage equality. The landmark legislation, passed last year and now coming into effect, represents a monumental victory for the LGBTQ+ community after over a decade of relentless advocacy.""This could be a model for the world,"" said Kittinun Daramadhaj, president of the Rainbow Sky Association of Thailand. ""There is true marriage equality in Thailand.""Under the groundbreaking law, same-sex couples gain full legal, financial, and medical rights, including adoption and inheritance protections. For many, this legislation signals a new chapter of inclusion and progress in a country long celebrated for its vibrant LGBTQ+ culture.Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra praised the achievement during an event last week, where she welcomed LGBTQ+ couples and activists to the government's offices. ""This demonstrates that Thailand is ready to embrace diversity and accept love in all its forms,"" she said.Festivities to mark this historic occasion are set to unfold across the country. In Bangkok, at least 200 couples will tie the knot in a mass wedding at a bustling shopping mall, co-organised by Bangkok Pride and local authorities. A colourful ""pride carpet"" will be rolled out for the newlyweds, accompanied by performances from celebrities and drag queens.Celebrations will also ripple through other regions, from the coastal city of Pattaya to the mountainous city of Chiang Mai, with rainbow flags waving as symbols of love and resilience.""This is not just a victory for the LGBTQ+ community but for all of Thailand,"" said one participant in Bangkok. ""It shows that love truly knows no boundaries.""Thailand's achievement places it alongside Taiwan and Nepal as the only Asian jurisdictions recognising same-sex marriage. However, rights experts caution that Thailand may remain an outlier in the region, where progress on LGBTQ+ rights has been slow.Globally, more than 30 jurisdictions recognise same-sex marriage, primarily in Europe, the Americas, and Australasia, according to the Pew Research Center.While Thursday’s celebrations mark a significant milestone, advocates emphasise that the fight for equality is far from over. Activists are now pushing for the Thai government to allow transgender individuals to legally change their gender identity, a long-overdue recognition for the country's estimated 314,000 trans people.""There’s a misconception that trans people are fully embraced in Thailand, but there's still a lot of work to be done,"" said Hua Boonyapisomparn of the Foundation of Transgender Alliance for Human Rights.","Thailand becomes the first Southeast Asian nation to recognise marriage equality.

President Donald Trump announced the appointment of Sean Curran as the new director of the US Secret Service on Wednesday.The announcement was made via Trump's Truth Social platform, where he praised Curran as a ""Great Patriot"" who has protected his family over the past few years. ""It is my great honor to appoint Sean Curran as the next Director of the United States Secret Service. Sean is a Great Patriot, who has protected my family over the past few years, and that is why I trust him to lead the Brave Men and Women of the United States Secret Service,"" Trump said.further explaining the reasoning behind the appointment, Trump said, ""Sean has distinguished himself as a brilliant leader, who is capable of directing and leading operational security plans for some of the most complex Special Security Events in the History of our Country, and the World. He proved his fearless courage when he risked his own life to help save mine from an assassin’s bullet in Butler , Pennsylvania. I have complete and total confidence in Sean to make the United States Secret Service stronger than ever before.""Curran, who joined the Secret Service in September 2001, previously served as the special agent in charge of Trump's security detail for four years. In this role, he oversaw 85 personnel and notably protected Trump during the first assassination attempt against him on July 13 in Butler, Pennsylvania. An insider revealed to CNN that Curran actively advocated for enhanced security measures for Trump, and subsequently hurried towards the stage when shots rang out during the Butler event.On December 29, Curran was promoted to deputy special agent in charge of the Presidential Protective Detail, a unit consisting of hundreds of agents responsible for protecting the current president and the first family.Trump's decision to appoint Curran goes against the recommendations of two bipartisan commissions, which suggested in 2015 and earlier this year that the next president should choose someone outside the agency to serve as director. Unlike other cabinet positions or the FBI director, the appointment of the Secret Service director does not require Senate confirmation.Additionally, several official sources quoted by CNN have expressed reservations about Curran's administrative capabilities to lead an organisation as intricate and substantial as the Secret Service. Whilst Curran's experience includes overseeing approximately 85 personnel during his tenure on Trump's security detail, he has not previously handled the extensive operational responsibilities or financial management that the Secret Service position demands.Curran will replace Ron Rowe , who has been acting director since July, following the resignation of former Director Kimberly Cheatle. Cheatle stepped down amid criticism of the agency's failure to prevent an assassination attempt on Trump during a campaign rally in July last year, which resulted in the injury of two attendees and the death of 50-year-old Cory Comperatore.","Sean Curran will replace Ron Rowe, who has been acting director since July, following the resignation of former Director Kimberly Cheatle.

Poll What Do You Think About Pregnant Women Opting for Preterm C-Sections Due to Citizenship Concerns? A Risky Decision for Both Mother and Child A Desperate Measure for Stability

HYDERABAD: C-section in the US has a new trigger: citizenship pangs.At a maternity clinic in New Jersey, Dr S D Rama has been fielding an unusually high number of requests for pre-term delivery since President Donald Trump’s Jan 20 proclamation about termination of birthright citizenship under the 14th Amendment.The majority of those dialling Rama or queuing up at her clinic are Indian women in their eighth or ninth month of pregnancy, all asking for C-sections to be scheduled before Feb 20. A few are still a couple of months away from full term.“A seven months pregnant woman came with her husband to sign up for a preterm delivery. She isn’t due until sometime in March,” Rama told TOI from New Jersey on Wednesday.The desperation to beat the birthright citizenship deadline — babies born Feb 20 onwards to those who aren’t permanent residents won’t be automatically entitled to citizenship — is apparently widespread.“I am trying to tell couples that even if it is possible, a preterm birth poses significant risk to mother and child. Complications include underdeveloped lungs, feeding problems, low birth weight, neurological complications and more,” said Dr S G Mukkala, an obstetrician and gynaecologist in Texas. “In the past two days, I have spoken to 15 to 20 couples regarding this.”With the backlog for green cards stretching to over a century now, birthright citizenship was a safety net for many expectant couples, especially Indians working in the US.“We were counting on our child being born here,” said Varun, who along with his wife Priya (names changed) moved to the US eight years ago on H-1B visas. “We’ve been waiting for our green cards for six years. This was the only way to ensure stability for our family. We are terrified of the uncertainty.” Priya, 34, is due to give birth in early March.A 28-year-old finance professional said his plans would go haywire if his dependant wife were to give birth to their first child after the deadline. “We sacrificed so much to come here. Now, it feels like the door is closing on us,” the H-1B holder said, still a few months away from parenthood.For illegal immigrants, the change in policy has even stronger ramifications.California-based Vijay (name changed), who has been living in the US for eight years since entering the country illegally, said he and his seven months pregnant wife were “crushed” by the news of the Trump administration enforcing the deadline so soon. “We thought of seeking asylum, but then my wife got pregnant and our lawyer suggested that we get direct citizenship through our child. Now, we are all at sea.”",President Donald Trump's Jan 20 proclamation about termination of birthright citizenship under the 14th Amendment.

Elon Musk: How long will Elon Musk last in Trump's good book after Vivek Ramaswamy's DOGE exit? 'Longer than many but...',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/how-long-will-elon-musk-last-in-trumps-good-book-after-vivek-ramaswamys-doge-exit-longer-than-many-but-/articleshow/117467770.cms,"Anthony Scaramucci said Elon Musk would last around a year in Trump's good book.

What happened to Vivek Ramaswamy?

As Vivek Ramaswamy is believed to have fallen out of Donald Trump's grace now that he is out of the Department of Government Efficiency leaving Elon Musk alone at the helm, speculations are rife as to how long Elon Musk will survive in Donald Trump's good books. Trump's former aide Anthony Scaramucci who was fired as his communications director in 11 days during his first term said Elon musk will outlast most of the new crowd as he brings in a lot of money. But he will not last more than a year, Scaramucci said.MAGA 2,0 will being about big-name firings and fallout, he said adding that Musk will be out of Trump's orbit in a year's time and Secretary of State Marco Rubio won't survive that much longer.“A lot of these guys will get blown out,” Scaramucci said. “I don’t see how Marco Rubio can last more than a year. Marco Rubio is philosophically antithetical to what Trump wants to do in society from a geopolitical perspective. So he’s gonna switch on a dime and just embrace all of the Trump stuff? Come on, it’s not gonna happen.”Scaramucci said Trump is a “maniac” and suggested it is only a matter of a time before infighting erupts inside the West Wing.“So now, all of a sudden, this new group of people is going to come in and everything’s going to work out hunky dory?” he said. “It’s not going to happen. So will Elon last longer than other people? Sure, because he’s worth $250, $400 billion and Trump is a little afraid of him. So yes, he’ll last longer than other people, but he’s already out to pasture.”Amid speculations that Ramaswamy fell out of the inner MAGA circle because of his post criticizing American culture, it is not exactly know what went wrong for Ramaswamy who will now be focusing on Ohio governor election.","Anthony Scaramucci said Elon Musk will outlast most of the new crowd as he brings in a lot of money.
