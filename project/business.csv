No case of cheating made out in

Odisha coal scam

: Court

NEW DELHI: A Delhi court Wednesday acquitted six accused, including a former coal secretary and two other public servants, in an alleged coal scam case related to allocation of blocks in Odisha, reports Vineet Upadhyay.Special judge Sanjay Bansal acquitted former coal secretary Harish Chandra Gupta , former joint secretary in ministry of coal K S Kropha, and former director in the coal allocation section of the ministry K C Samria, noting accused public servants cannot be held accountable when Navbharat Power Pvt Ltd , the company which got the coal block, followed proper processes and was eligible.When the application (by NPPL) has been found to be complete and the applicant has been found to be an eligible applicant, and allocation was recommended to a company which had recommendation from MoP (ministry of power) and state govt of Odisha, the accused public servants cannot be held accountable for any offence. For any lapse on their part, the accused public servants may be administratively liable but are certainly not criminally liable, in the facts and circumstances of the present case,"" the court concluded.The court, taking note that the company received various permissions from different authorities and made substantial progress in the development of the coal block as well as completion of its power project, said that these factors showed that the organisation was a competent company and allocation of the coal block to it was not a wrong decision.The court noted that no case of cheating was made out as no one was induced as the ""application has been found to be complete, when the applicant company NPPL has been found to be an eligible company, and when no misrepresentations were made by the company, no question arises for the existence of any conspiracy. It is held that the prosecution has failed to prove any conspiracy.""It also acquitted NPPL, the name of which later changed to Brahmani Thermal Power Private Limited (BTPPL), its then chairman P Trivikrama Prasad, and then managing director (MD) Y Harish Chandra Prasad. It acquitted all six accused of the charges, including IPC sections 120B (criminal conspiracy), 406 (criminal breach of trust) and 420 (cheating), and sections under the Prevention of Corruption Act .The case relates to the said company obtaining coal blocks in Odisha's Rampia, Dipside of Rampia, and Mandakini between 2006 and 2008 by allegedly misrepresenting its financial strength, net worth and land holdings.An FIR was registered under sections of Prevention of Corruption Act along with relevant provisions of IPC in Sept 2012 on a reference made by Central Vigilance Commission (CVC).","A Delhi court Wednesday acquitted six accused, including a former coal secretary and two other public servants, in an alleged coal scam case.

Despite Telangana notice, Dosanjh singing songs with twisted lyrics: Complainant

CHANDIGARH: No songs mentioning alcohol, drugs or violence. And no ""twisted words"" to bypass this directive, says an 'advisory' issued to singer-actor Diljit Dosanjh by the Chandigarh Commission for Protection of Child Rights ( CCPCR ) ahead of his concert in the city this Saturday.The notice comes less than a month after Telangana government clamped similar restrictions on the singer before his Dil-Luminati India tour gig in Hyderabad.Dosanjh, scheduled to perform at Exhibition Ground in Chandigarh's Sector 34, will be liable for penal action if the order is not complied with, the commission's chairperson Shipra Bansal said.Songs that refer or allude to alcohol, drugs and violence affect children of impressionable age, the panel said.The concert organisers are required to ensure that those below 25 years - the legal drinking age in Chandigarh - are not served alcohol. Any violation is punishable under Juvenile Justice Act and other relevant laws, the notice mentions. ""Other than the organiser and singer, the UT administration has been marked in a copy of the advisory,"" Bansal said, adding that ""it is also the responsibility of parents to make kids understand"".Bansal said singer Karan Aujla had received a similar notice for his Dec 7 show.The CCPCR advisory also cited a WHO report that highlights the perils of being exposed to high decibels. Even adults should not be exposed to sound levels above 140db. For children, the optimum is 120 db, the notice states. ""It is advisable not to invite children on the stage during the live show where peak sound pressure level is above 120db, which is harmful for children.""In Hyderabad, Diljit Dosanjh tweaked the lyrics of his songs, replacing mention of alcohol with another word. He also faced protests by right-wing organisations in Indore for reciting couplets from Rahat Indori's poem, 'Kisi Ke Baap Ka Hindustan Thodi Hai', which was often heard during the anti-CAA agitation.Both Telangana govt's notice and CCPCR advisory to Aujla and Dosanjh were issued following complaints by Pandit Rao Dharennavar, assistant professor at Chandigarh's Post-Graduate Govt College. ""Even after the notice by Telangana's child and women department for not performing such songs, Dosanjh has been singing those songs with twisted lyrics on the stage, which youngsters sing along with him that too in the original form. In the concert, children aged below 13 years are allowed to enter,"" Dharennavar said.The Sector 41 resident said he would also file a complaint against rapper A P Dhillon's scheduled Dec 21 show, specifically his song 'Old Money' that allegedly promotes violence.","Songs that refer or allude to alcohol, drugs and violence affect children of impressionable age, Chandigarh Commission for Protection of Child Rights says.

"CCS clears two big-ticket arms deals worth Rs 21,100 crore",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ccs-clears-two-big-ticket-arms-deals-worth-rs-21100-crore/articleshow/116269771.cms,"India strengthens its defence with a Rs 21,100cr investment in 100 K-9 Vajra artillery guns and 12 Sukhoi-30MKI fighter jets.

NEW DELHI: In a move that will add some much-needed firepower to the armed forces, two major defence deals for 100 more K-9 Vajra artillery guns and 12 Sukhoi-30MKI fighter jets , collectively worth Rs 21,100 crore, have been cleared by the cabinet committee on security.The CCS on Thursday gave the final nod for the Rs 7,600 crore contract for 100 K-9 Vajra self-propelled tracked gun systems to add to the 100 such 155mm guns already inducted through the joint venture between L&T and South Korean Hanwha Defence, top sources told TOI.The Rs 13,500 crore deal for the 12 Sukhois, which will be manufactured by Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) under licence from Russia, along with associated equipment and spares, in turn, was given the green signal by the CCS last week.“The deal for the 12 Sukhois was inked by the defence ministry (MoD) with HAL on Thursday. While the Sukhois will be manufactured by the Nashik division of the HAL and have an indigenous content (IC) of 62.6%, the additional K-9 guns will have around 60% IC ,” an official said.The Army has deployed some of the first 100 K-9 Vajra guns, which were originally procured for deserts at a cost of Rs 4,366 crore, in eastern Ladakh after equipping them with “winterised kits” for the high-altitude area amid the military confrontation with China.“With a strike range of 28-38 km, the 100 new guns will come with the winterised kits to ensure their batteries, oil, lubricants and other systems do not freeze in sub-zero temperatures. The ongoing Russia-Ukraine war has reinforced the need for long-range, high-volume firepower,” another source said.The additional 12 Sukhois, in turn, will replace the ones that have crashed over the years. The IAF currently has 259 twin-engine Sukhois, the bulk of them produced by HAL under licence from Russia for over $12 billion, which constitute around 50% of its combat fleet.Amid the continuing delay in induction of the indigenous single-engine Tejas Mark-1A fighters, the IAF is grappling with just 30 squadrons when at least 42 are needed to tackle the twin threat from China and Pakistan.Though the 36 omni-role Rafale fighters, inducted under the Rs 59,000 crore deal with France in Sept 2016, have added some punch to IAF’s combat capabilities, the major depletion in fighter squadrons is a big concern for the defence establishment.Towards this end, the defence ministry in Sept had also inked the over Rs 26,000 crore contract with HAL for the procurement of 240 AL-31FP aeroengines to sustain the operational capabilities of Sukhois. The aeroengines will be manufactured by the Koraput Division of HAL, with the defence PSU sourcing some components from Russia.There is also the major indigenous upgrade plan to make 84 Sukhois much more lethal with advanced radars, avionics, longer-range weapons and multi-sensor fusion to ensure they are capable of air combat for another 30 years.This Rs 63,000 crore project, which will ensure the new `Super Sukhois’ are close to fifth-generation fighters in terms of stealth and capabilities, will also soon head for the final clearance by the CCS, as was earlier reported by TOI.At present, 40 Sukhoi fighters have also been modified to carry the air-to-ground precision-strike BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles, whose range has been extended from 290 to 450-km, to constitute a decidedly deadly weapons package.","Two major defence deals for 100 more K-9 Vajra artillery guns and 12 Sukhoi-30MKI fighter jets have been cleared by the cabinet committee on security.

What Swachh ranking won't tell you about Indore's air quality,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/what-swachh-ranking-wont-tell-you-about-indores-air-quality/articleshow/116269741.cms,"Indore

The irony is hard to miss. Indore, which has worn the crown of India's 'cleanest city' in government's Swachh rankings for seven straight years, has been struggling to clean up its air. The largest city in Madhya Pradesh has seen a 21% rise in levels of the pollutant PM10 between 2017-18 and 2023-24, according to recently released govt data.Indore figured among 31 'non-attainment' cities - where air quality had deteriorated since the 2017-18 base year - in a list of 130 that are monitored under the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), which aims to reduce PM10 levels in these urban centres by up to 40% by 2025-26.While the list of 'non-attainment' cities includes places such as Navi Mumbai and Vizag, which also ranked high in the 2023 Swachh ratings, Indore's name stands out. It sees itself as a model city and has acquired an international reputation of sorts for cleaning up its act on sanitation and waste management, which form the basis of Swachh rankings. The city has been topping the Swachh Bharat surveys since 2016, but that's also roughly the period that NCAP has examined to find a deterioration in the city's air.It's not hard to see why the city's air quality has been slipping. As the major commercial and industrial hub of the region, Indore has urbanised rapidly. A 2019 paper - Air Pollution Knowledge Assessments for 20 Indian Cities - published in Urban Climate found that the built-up area in Indore and its neighbourhood had grown about nine-fold between 1975 and 2014, the highest among the 20 cities the study looked at and more than double the average increase (4.2-fold) seen across these cities.Indore has more than 3,000 micro, small and medium enterprise (MSME) units. Over 500 real estate projects are under construction in the district, according to Credai. Revenue from property registrations in the city jumped to Rs 1,339 crore, up 7.2%, between April and Oct 2024 compared with the corresponding period last year, according to official data.The city is also a major transport hub. Three national highways pass through Indore - NH 52 (part of the old Agra-Mumbai road), NH 47 (Nagpur-Bamanbore in Gujarat) and NH 347BG (within MP). Besides, two major state highways, SH 27 and SH 31, run close to the city. Indore itself has more than 20 lakh vehicles. Per the Regional Transport Office, around 8,000 two-wheelers and 2,500-3,000 cars are registered every month in the city.""Traffic management has failed to keep pace with the rate of new vehicles hitting the roads. There are substantial emissions from congested traffic, including from vehicle tyres, which are particularly harmful,"" says city-based environmentalist O P Joshi.Not surprisingly, the major contributor to Indore's pollution is the road dust kicked up by traffic movement. Vehicular emissions come second. Per a source-apportionment study by Clean Air Catalyst, a flagship programme launched by the US Agency for International Development and a global partnership of organisations led by World Resources Institute, road dust contributes nearly three-fourths of the city's coarse particulate matter (PM10), with transportation, industries, construction and household cooking making up most of the rest.Road dust also leads in the share of fine particulate pollution (PM2.5) at 55%, followed by transportation, industries and household cooking.This isn't very bad news for city authorities. Dust management is the low-hanging fruit among pollution-mitigation measures and doesn't involve harsh actions impacting people and livelihoods. ""Road dust gets resuspended in the air due to vehicular movement and wind. Continued optimal cleaning of roads would help minimise its impact,"" says Prakash Doraiswamy, senior scientist at Clean Air Catalyst and director of air quality at WRI.Overall, too, Indore's location lends it certain natural advantages.""Unlike the bowl-shaped Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) where calm winds and low temperatures lead to an accumulation of pollutants, Indore is a much windier place with an average wind speed of around 11kmph, which blows away a lot of pollution. Also, unlike the alluvial soil in IGP, the black soil in central India kicks up less dust,"" says Dipankar Saha, former head of Central Pollution Control Board's air laboratory division.""Pristine air quality remains one of our focus areas. We are advocating large-scale plantation and utilising machinery to sweep roads to minimise dust. To curtail vehicular emissions, we are augmenting our public transport fleet with electric and CNG vehicles,"" says Indore divisional commissioner Deepak Singh.If implemented well, these measures should make a dent in the city's PM levels. However, to bring pollution down to India's safe standards - 60 μg/m3 annually for PM10 and 40 μg/m3 for PM2.5 - Indore will have to do much more. A good place to begin would be data. The city recently increased the number of its air pollution monitors to seven. However, an analysis by Urban Emissions shows that the agglomeration of Indore, Dewas, Ujjain, Mhow and Pitampura needs a minimum of 26 monitors for particulate matter alone.Only through granular data can Indore zero in on zones of high pollution to reach the level of sanitation in the air that the city seems to have achieved on the ground.",Indore has worn the crown of India's 'cleanest city' in government's Swachh rankings for seven straight years. The largest city in Madhya Pradesh has seen a 21% rise in levels of the pollutant PM10 between 2017-18 and 2023-24.

When I go to attend international conferences where there is a discussion on road accidents, I try to hide my face.”Gadkari’s admission came during the Question Hour, where he also stressed the need for significant changes in human behavior, societal attitudes, and respect for the rule of law to improve road safety. Sharing a personal anecdote, the minister recounted a major accident involving him and his family several years ago, which required prolonged hospitalization.“By the grace of God, I and my family were saved. So I have my personal experience of accidents,” he said.Highlighting key factors contributing to road mishaps, Gadkari pointed to improper parking of trucks and lack of lane discipline as major issues. He noted that many accidents are caused by trucks parked haphazardly on roads. To address safety concerns, he announced directives for adopting international standards in bus body design, including equipping buses with hammers near windows for emergency escapes during accidents.The minister painted a grim picture of road safety in India, revealing that road accidents claim 1.78 lakh lives annually, with 60% of victims falling within the 18-34 age group.Among states, Uttar Pradesh recorded the highest number of fatalities, with over 23,000 deaths accounting for 13.7% of total road accident deaths, followed by Tamil Nadu (18,000 deaths, or 10.6%), Maharashtra (15,000 deaths, or 9%), and Madhya Pradesh (13,000 deaths, or 8%).In terms of cities, Delhi led the tally with over 1,400 deaths, followed by Bengaluru (915 deaths) and Jaipur (850 deaths).","Road accidents claim 1.78 lakh lives annually, with 60% of victims falling within the 18-34 age group.

VARANASI/BENGALURU: A Bengaluru police team reached UP's Jaunpur Thursday looking for the Singhania family accused of abetting the suicide of Subhash Atul , a senior AI executive at a leading automobile firm. But police met with little success as their houses were locked and phones switched off.Jaunpur Kotwali inspector Mithilesh Kumar Mishra said Atul's mother-in-law Nisha and her son Anurag had left their house on a motorbike Wednesday night. When some reporters camping there asked where they were going, Anurag replied his mother was unwell.According to neighbours, the Singhania family had moved in two months ago. Police have launched a manhunt and pasted a notice on the entrance of the house, asking residents to appear before the IO .""We are in constant touch with local police, and they are working with us to trace the suspects,"" DCP Shivakumar Gunare of Bengaluru police said.Atul, 34, took his life in his Bengaluru apartment early Monday amid a prolonged legal battle involving divorce, child custody, and a Rs 3.3 crore demand from his estranged wife Nikita Singhania. According to the FIR filed by Atul's brother Bikas, his estranged wife and her family allegedly demanded Rs 3 crore to drop police cases and Rs 30 lakh for visitation rights to see his four-year-old son. Bengaluru police registered a case against Nikita, her mother Nisha, brother Anurag, and uncle Sushil Singhania.His lawyer Dinesh Mishra said Thursday Atul was earning a monthly salary of Rs 84,000 and the family court in Jaunpur had ordered him in July to pay Rs 40,000 a month as maintenance for his son, which he might have found burdensome.Atul left behind a 24-page suicide note and an 81-minute video detailing alleged harassment by Nikita and his in-laws, and accused the family court judge of bias. However, his lawyer Mishra said the orders passed by the court were in accordance with the law.""The court did not mandate any compensation for his wife, as she was earning a sufficient income in Delhi. Atul might have found the Rs 40,000 payment steep. He had the option to challenge the order by appealing to higher courts, including HC,"" Mishra said.According to the lawyer, Atul never demonstrated violent behaviour or mood swings while appearing before family court. ""I suspect his wife and others might have demanded more money from him, forcing him to think they were blackmailing or extorting him.""

NEW DELHI: Home minister Amit Shah will visit Chhattisgarh for three days, starting Saturday, during which he will chair a security review meeting on Left-Wing Extremism (LWE) in Raipur, with likely focus on fine-tuning strategies to achieve the target of eliminating the menace by March 31, 2026.This is not the first time that Shah will be visiting a security camp deep inside what was once a Maoist stronghold. He has toured CRPF forward operating bases on more than one occasion, to keep the morale of counter-Naxal forces high and get a first-hand feel of how they secure the area around a camp, while facilitating an administration and development push in adjoining villages.On Sunday he will honour the Chhattisgarh police by awarding it the 'President's Colour' at the Police Parade Ground in Raipur. Chhattisgarh police was named for the prestigious 'President's Police Colour' award in Oct this year, in recognition of 25 years of exemplary service and unwavering dedication to the nation, particularly their brave fight against Naxalites.Later that day, Shah will arrive in Jagdalpur and meet people affected by Naxal violence, at the Circuit House there. He will also interact with LWE victims as well as surrendered Maoists, besides meeting players participating in the Bastar Olympics and encouraging them at the closing ceremony of the games in Jagdalpur.On Sunday, Shah will pay tribute to security personnel who made the supreme sacrifice while fighting Maoists and also meet the their families in Jagdalpur. He will then visit a camp and inspect the development work in a village, before winding up with a lunch with personnel.The same evening, he will chair a security review meeting in Raipur, to be attended by the state administrative and police brass and officers of central paramilitary forces and intelligence agencies. The meeting will focus on uprooting LWE from the country by March 2026, with continued emphasis on 'zero tolerance' and 'ultra-modern methods'.With the area of Naxal influence having shrunk to a few pockets like Abujmaad in south Bastar, the emphasis will be on freeing remaining areas from Maoists' hold, followed by a development and welfare push.","Home minister Amit Shah will visit Chhattisgarh for three days, starting Saturday.

NEW DELHI: While putting a freeze on the spate of lawsuits for reclamation of temples allegedly converted to mosques during the Mughal era while it hears the validity of the Places of Worship Act , 1991, Supreme Court said on Thursday, ""The primary issue which arises for consideration is Sections 3 and 4 of the 1991 Act, their contours as well as their width and expanse. As the matter is sub judice before the court, we deem it appropriate to direct that though fresh suits (raising mosque-temple disputes) can be filed, no suit will be registered and proceedings undertaken (by trial courts) till further orders of the SC."" ""Further, we also direct that in pending suits, trial courts will not pass any effective and final order, including orders for survey, till the next date of hearing,"" the bench said in its omnibus status quo order.The ruling, which was at odds with the refusal last year of a bench led by then CJI D Y Chandrachud to impose a prohibition on suits, drew vociferous opposition from senior advocates Rakesh Dwivedi, Maninder Singh, Vijay Hansaria and Vikas Singh, who said the court could not pass such a blanket order without hearing the Hindu parties. Advocate Sai Deepak said for implementation of the 1991 Act, surveys were mandatory to determine the religious character of disputed structures on Aug 15, 1947.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta said: ""When suits between two parties were pending in different trial courts, was it judicially permissible for a third unrelated party (Muslim organisations and petitioners) to come before the SC and seek a stay on those proceedings?"" There are 18 suits pending before various trial courts raising reclamation of temple demand for 11 mosques. SC brushed aside the objections and asked when the core issue regarding Places of Worship Act was pending consideration before the highest court, would it not be proper for trial courts to hold their hands? ""When the matter is pending in SC, will it be just and fair for any other court to deal with the subject matter and examine it? We are examining both the validity and ambit of the Act,"" it said. Justice Viswanathan gave a glimpse of court's mind on the conflicting stands of the two sides when he said, ""There is a larger question. The suits which are pending must be stayed as Section 3 of the 1991 Act is to be adjudicated by the SC.""""One view is that Section 3 is an effective manifestation or the reiteration of already embedded constitutional principles, so much so that even without the Act, if a suit were to be objected on the ground of plain constitutional principles, it is subject to interim orders from the court. Since the issue is pending in SC, civil courts cannot run a race with the SC. It is as simple as this."" SC had issued notice to the Centre on advocate-petitioner Ashwini Upadhyay's 2020 petition on March 12, 2021 and onJamiat Ulama-i-Hind 's petition on Sept 9, 2022. On Thursday, it found the Union govt had not filed its response till date. The CJI Khanna-led bench told the SG that Centre must file a response to the cross-petitions in four weeks. It appointed three nodal counsel - Ejaz Maqbool, Kanu Agarwal and Vishnu Shankar Jain - to coordinate and compile responses of both sides and the Centre.""The Centre's reply must come on record. We require your response, and we cannot hear these petitions without the Union govt's stand. The questions framed by the SC on Oct 12, 2022 will give you a fair idea to frame your response,"" the bench said. The matter was posted for hearing on Feb 17, 2025.PILs by the Hindu side have questioned the validity of the 1991 Act on grounds that Parliament did not have the competence to apply the law retrospectively and freeze status of religious structure as existing on Aug 15, 1947 when mosques were constructed over thousands of razed temples. The Muslim side argued history could not be changed through court orders and sought strict implementation of the Act, which had carved out an exception for the suits pending on the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid dispute.A five-judge bench on Nov 9, 2019 had awarded the disputed site for construction of Ram temple, but had ruled that the 1991 Act was an ""affirmation of solemn duty which was cast upon the state to preserve and protect the equality of faiths as an essential constitutional value, a norm which has the status of being a basic feature of the Constitution. In preserving the character of places of public worship, Parliament has mandated in no uncertain terms that history and its wrongs shall not be used as instruments to oppress the present and the future"".

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court has held that mere allegation of harassment cannot be a ground to slap a charge for abetment to commit suicide if it is not established that the accused instigated or pushed the deceased to take the fatal step.The observations came from a bench of Justices Vikram Nath and P B Varale while delivering a verdict on an appeal challenging a Gujarat HC order refusing to discharge a woman's husband and her in-laws for allegedly harassing her and driving her to suicide. The observations gain significance in the wake of the recent suicide of 34-year-old techie Atul Subhash, who alleged harassment at the hands of his estranged wife and her family.""...The prosecution must demonstrate an active or direct action by the accused that led the deceased to take his/her own life. The element of mens rea cannot simply be presumed or inferred; it must be evident and explicitly discernible. Without this, the foundational requirement for establishing abetment under the law is not satisfied, underscoring the necessity of a deliberate and conspicuous intent to provoke or contribute to the act of suicide,"" said the bench.The court said that to secure a conviction under Section 306, it is necessary to establish a clear mens rea to instigate or push the deceased to commit suicide, which requires a specific act, omission, creation of circumstances, or words that would incite or provoke another person to take his/her own life.""The act of abetment must be explicitly demonstrated through actions or behaviours of the accused that directly contributed to the victim's decision to take his/her own life. Harassment, in itself, does not suffice unless it is accompanied by deliberate acts of incitement or facilitation.""...The court examines whether the accused's conduct, including provoking, urging, or tarnishing the victim's self-esteem, created an unbearable situation. If the accused's actions were intended only to harass or express anger, they might not meet the threshold for abatement or investigation,"" it said.","The observations came from a bench of Justices Vikram Nath and P B Varale.

The Centre has been granted four weeks to submit its affidavit addressing the provisions of the Act, which petitioners claim is unconstitutional and denies the rights of Hindus, Jains, Buddhists, and Sikhs to restore their places of worship destroyed by historical invaders.The 1991 Places of Worship Act prohibits the conversion of any place of worship and mandates that its religious character as of August 15, 1947, be preserved.Several petitioners, including BJP leader Subramanian Swamy, members of the Kashi Royal Family, and other leaders, argue that the law unfairly denies communities the right to reclaim and restore their historical places of worship .","Advocate Ashwini Upadhyay said that the religious character of a place cannot be determined through mere observation.

BJP & allies back ONOE bills, say vital to cut costs, synchronise vibrant democracy

NEW DELHI: In a move aimed at streamlining India's electoral process, the Union Cabinet on Thursday approved the ""one nation, one election"" bills, with plans to introduce these during the current session of Parliament.The decision to clear two bills marks a significant step towards synchronising polls for Lok Sabha, state legislative assemblies and local bodies as part of a plan to unburden the executive from the weight of periodic elections and improve decision-making across all tiers of governance.The cabinet nod is to draft legislations to hold simultaneous polls to Lok Sabha and state assemblies. But whether it will turn into the stride to restore the simultaneous elections, which remained in vogue until the Lok Sabha elections and assembly polls were decoupled between 1967 and 1971, remains to be seen.The proposal has been under discussion for years as the idea was to revert to the pre-1967 state when one election was conducted. A panel led by former president Ram Nath Kovind had found that in Maharashtra, almost six months of a particular year were spent in poll-related matters due to multiple elections.While the first bill, which aims at holding simultaneous elections for Lok Sabha and state assemblies, will need to be approved by Parliament, the one for local bodies will need the endorsement of at least half the states.BJP and its allies voiced strong support for proposed legislations on the ' one nation one election ' plan, drafted after extensive consultations with political parties and experts and a high-level panel studying electoral processes in seven countries.BJP described the legislations as essential for synchronising India's vibrant democracy with effective cost management and ensuring policy continuity. JD(U) has backed the bill, with party chief Nitish Kumar firmly in support of simultaneous elections for Lok Sabha and assemblies.""The proposed bill will strengthen the country's democracy and is set to be instrumental in making India a developed nation,"" BJP's chief spokesperson and Lok Sabha MP Anil Baluni said. He added the bill was drafted with inputs from independent constitutional and legal bodies and did not infringe upon the basic structure of the Constitution. JD(U) working president Sanjay Jha said, ""Our party welcomes this. We communicated our support to the committee, where I was part of the delegation. Nitish Kumar has consistently advocated simultaneous elections. The constant election cycle disrupts public and developmental work.""Union minister and LJP (RV) chief Chirag Paswan endorsed the move and highlighted its benefits, especially in fostering development.In Sept, the Cabinet had endorsed the proposal for simultaneous elections for Lok Sabha, assemblies, urban bodies and panchayats within a 100-day window, based on the recommendations of the Ram Nath Kovind committee.During the consultation, 32 political parties supported the concept, while 15 opposed it. Among national parties, Congress, AAP, BSP and CPM were against it, while BJP and NPP favoured it. Notable state parties opposing it included AIUDF, Trinamool Congress, AIMIM, CPI, DMK, SP. Supporting state parties included AIADMK, All Jharkhand Students Union, AGP, BJD, LJP (R), and Shiv SenaJD(U), SAD . Several parties did not respond, including BRS, NCP, RJD, TDP and YSRCP.The committee had reviewed election systems in countries like South Africa, Sweden, Belgium, Germany, Japan, Indonesia and the Philippines. On Wednesday, former President Kovind stressed the need for a consensus and said, ""This initiative transcends political interests for the welfare of the nation. Economists suggest that implementing one nation one election could increase the country's GDP by 1-1.5%.""","BJP & allies back ONOE bills, say vital to cut costs, synchronise vibrant democracy.

NEW DELHI: Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha proceedings on Thursday were adjourned for the day amid heated exchanges between the treasury and opposition benches on the notice to remove Vice-President Jagdeep Dhankhar and George Soros and Adani issues .Amid ruckus in the Lower House, Speaker Om Birla allowed BJP's Nishikant Dubey to speak. Dubey attacked Congress leadership for their alleged connection with Soros, and the latter allegedly having financed the Gandhis through donations made to Rajiv Gandhi Foundation (RGF) and other trusts linked to the Gandhis. ""What's RGF and Sonia Gandhi's relationship with Soros?"" he asked.Dubey said opposition is trying to muzzle his voice as he is trying to raise these issues. ""What connection does Sonia Gandhi have with FDL-AP (Forum of Democratic Leaders in Asia-Pacific), which is anti-India and advocates Kashmir as a separate country?"" he asked amid din. BJP had earlier claimed Sonia is connected to the organisation which is funded by Soros-backed outfits.Quoting the Nambiar committee report, Dubey alleged that Sam Pitroda, a close associate of the Gandhis, had been accused of irregularities of Rs 150 crore. Pitroda and his Global Knowledge Initiative (GKI) is funded by Soros and US development agencies, he claimed, adding that all of Rahul's overseas visits are ""sponsored by GKI"".""Pitroda, GKI, Soros and Rahul, what connections do they have?"" the BJP MP said as he claimed that investments were made by Soros, during UPA-1 and UPA-2, in the share market and these made huge gains.The morning session of the Upper House began with chairman Dhankhar, rejecting six notices from opposition, seeking adjournment of scheduled business. This triggered objections from opposition benches, prompting BJP MP J P Nadda to accuse leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge of undermining the chair's authority. Referring to a recent press conference by Kharge, he said, ""Criticising the chair outside the House is also objectionable and condemnable.""The BJP MP also reignited allegations of a link between Congress and Soros, accusing the hedge fund tycoon of funding efforts to destabilise India.This triggered a noisy protest from the opposition benches, which raised slogans against PM Narendra Modi and businessman Gautam Adani.In the post-lunch session, TMC MP Derek O'Brien raised a point of order, which was drowned out by din.

Wish you good health and long life,"" Kharge posted.Meanwhile, posters, extending birthday greetings to NCP-SCP chief Sharad Pawar were put up outside his residence in Delhi.Sharad Pawar, known to the masses as Saheb, was born on December 12, 1940.Hailing from a family in Baramati, Pune, Pawar started early in politics and became president of the State Youth Congress at 24 and a member of the State Cabinet 5 years later.Pawar has been Chief Minister of Maharashtra for seven years out of his 32 years in politics.During these years, Maharashtra became and retained a position as the leading industrial state in the country and also a state with a very managed treasury.Pawar has always stood for a society free of caste and communal biases. As chief minister he has consistently encouraged people of different communities, living in Maharashtra, to develop their special cultural and ethnic identity while contributing to the overall development of the state.Pawar is an economic liberal and believes that only large-scale investment leading to rapid economic development and increased employment makes a country a real international power.Last year in July, Nationalist Congress Party leader Ajit Pawar led a vertical split in his party, joined hands with the National Democratic Alliance and took oath as the Deputy Chief Minister of Maharashtra.The Maharashtra Assembly Election 2024 witnessed a decisive victory for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Mahayuti alliance, securing a landslide win with 235 seats. The results marked a significant milestone for the BJP, which emerged as the single-largest party with 132 seats. The Shiv Sena and Nationalist Congress Party also made notable gains, with 57 and 41 seats, respectively.The NCP's 'clock' symbol is with the Ajit Pawar group, following a ruling by the Election Commission of India (ECI) in February, recognising it as the official NCP. On March 19, the top court allowed the Ajit Pawar faction to use the 'clock' symbol, with certain conditions, including that his party would issue a public declaration that the use of the 'clock' symbol for Lok Sabha and the Maharashtra Assembly Elections is sub-judice and subject to the outcome of the challenge made by the Sharad Pawar group to the decision of the ECI.It had also asked the Ajit Pawar faction to not use the name and images of Sharad Pawar in its campaign materials. Following a rift between the Sharad Pawar and the Ajit Pawar factions of the NCP, the Election Commission of India recognised the Ajit Pawar's party as the real NCP based on its legislative majority and allotted the 'clock' symbol to it. The top court had asked the Sharad Pawar faction to use the 'Nationalist Congress Party-Sharad Chandra Pawar's name for upcoming elections and the ""man-blowing turha"" symbol.Earlier, the apex court had directed that the Election Commission's order of February 7 allotting 'Nationalist Congress Party-Sharadchandra Pawar' as the party name for the Sharad Pawar faction will continue till further orders.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi extended wishes to Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar on his 84th birthday.

'Started beating me like a beast', says estranged wife

Complaint filed by Bikas Kumar

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: A Bengaluru-based techie’s death has sent shockwaves across the country, with a 24-page suicide note and a chilling placard reading ""Justice is due"" found at the scene. Subash Atul , 34, was discovered hanging at his residence in Manjunath Layout on Monday. Employed by a private firm, Subash’s final words have reignited debates on the need for stronger legal protections for men.Atul’s brother, Bikas Kumar, has called for justice and stronger legal safeguards for men facing harassment.""I want justice for my brother. Laws should be made for men as well, as they also face harassment. The Government of India should recognise this. No arrests have been made yet, but we will proceed legally,"" said Kumar.He further called for legal reforms and action against judicial corruption, stating, ""I want my brother to get justice. I want this country to have a legal process through which even men can receive justice. I demand strict action against those in judicial positions engaging in corruption. If this continues, how can people expect justice?""Subhash’s father, Pawan Kumar, alleged that his son’s in-laws and the judicial system drove him to this point amid an ongoing legal battle over divorce and child custody.""He was forced to travel from Bengaluru to Jaunpur nearly 40 times. His wife kept filing one charge after another. He must have been under immense pressure, but he never let us sense it. Suddenly, we received news of his death. It’s 100% true that his wife and her family harassed him. We cannot describe the level of tension our son must have been in,"" said Pawan Kumar.Amid the public outcry following Atul’s death, his estranged wife, Nikita Singhania, and her family have denied any involvement in the incident.Her paternal uncle, Sushil Singhania, stated from Jaunpur, ""Neither I nor any family member was present at the scene. The claims made in the video will be addressed by Nikita shortly.""He further asserted that the family had no contact with Atul for the past three years and expressed faith in the judiciary. ""We are not guilty, and we trust the court to deliver a fair judgment,"" he said.According to a PTI report, Nikita had filed a complaint against Atul and his family at Jaunpur's Kotwali police station on April 24, 2022.The FIR accused Atul, his parents (Anju Devi and Pawan Modi), and his younger brother (Bikas) of harassment and assault over dowry demands. The charges were registered under IPC Sections 498A (cruelty by husband or relatives), 323 (assault), 504 (intentional insult to provoke breach of peace), 506 (criminal intimidation), along with provisions of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961.Nikita claimed that after their marriage on April 26, 2019, in Varanasi, Atul’s family expressed dissatisfaction with the wedding gifts from her parents and demanded an additional Rs 10 lakh. On August 16, 2019, they allegedly repeated the demand, and her father’s sudden death occurred the following day.Nikita also accused Atul of physical and mental abuse, alleging that he ""started to beat me up like a beast"" and ""used to transfer my entire salary from my account to his account by threatening me."" She claimed to have endured the abuse on her parents’ advice to remain patient, but the situation reportedly did not improve.Following Subhash’s death, Bikas Kumar filed a formal complaint with Marathahalli police, leading to the registration of a case under IPC Section 108 (abetment to suicide) and Section 3(5) of the BNS, which relates to joint criminal liability.The FIR named Atul’s wife, Nikita Singhania, along with her mother (Nisha), brother (Anurag), and uncle (Sushil Singhania) as accused.According to the complaint, the accused allegedly filed a false case against Atul, demanding a settlement of Rs 3 crore.Bikas’s statement to the police outlined the intense pressure his brother faced during the ongoing legal proceedings.""Every time Atul attended the court hearing, he was mocked by his in-laws and told to die if he could not pay the money or pay for visitation rights. These drove him to take the extreme step,"" he said.Expressing grief and frustration, Kumar remarked, ""My brother gave everything to this relationship. If he had shared his troubles with me or our father, we would have supported him. I urge the government and the President of India to ensure a thorough investigation. If my brother was in the wrong, let us see the evidence, but justice must prevail if he was truthful. There should also be an inquiry into the role of the judge involved in my brother’s case.""","Bengaluru-based Subash Atul, 34, was found dead at his home on Monday.

They claim victims are under investigation for narcotics or smuggling offences, convincing them to reveal their banking details or make digital payments.To help those in distress, the govt has established helplines, urging citizens to dial 1930 to report such incidents. Additionally, over 700 social-media accounts and groups, including 268 Facebook and 465 Telegram groups, have been deactivated in efforts to curb the fraud.The minister stressed that public awareness remains the most effective tool in combating these crimes, especially as scammers continue to target educational institutions and exploit social media platforms.","India has reported 42,000 cyber-crime cases, and 11,000 of them were in Karnataka.

NEW DELHI: “The mediation court didn’t follow the law, not even Supreme Court rules,” said Pawan Kumar , grieving the death of his 34-year-old son, Subhash Atul, a deputy general manager at an automobile firm, who died by suicide in Bengaluru on Monday.Atul’s father, Pawan Kumar, accused his son’s in-laws and the judicial system of pushing him to the edge during an ongoing legal battle over divorce and child custody.Speaking to the media, Pawan Kumar said,""He was forced to travel to Jaunpur from Bengaluru nearly 40 times. His wife kept filing one charge after another. He must have been under immense pressure, but he never let us sense it. Suddenly, we got the news of his death. It’s 100% true that his wife and her family harassed him. We cannot describe the level of tension our son must have been in.”Subhash's death has exposed allegations of his wife, Nikita Singhania, and her family demanding Rs 3 crore to withdraw legal cases and Rs 30 lakh for visitation rights to his son. His brother, Bikas Kumar, filed a police complaint, leading to cases of abetment to suicide being registered against Nikita, her mother Nisha, brother Anurag, and uncle Sushil Singhania.“My brother was mentally and physically exhausted ever since the court battle began. He was mocked by his in-laws and told to die if he couldn’t pay the money or gain visitation rights. This drove him to the extreme step,” said Bikas in his statement to the police.In his suicide note, Subhash detailed the unrelenting harassment he faced, including eight allegedly false police complaints, and accused a family court judge in Uttar Pradesh of bias. He also emailed an NGO advocating for men’s rights, announcing his intention to end his life.Subhash’s video message, recorded hours before his death, has since gone viral, drawing attention to men’s mental health and legal struggles. “The money I earn only strengthens my enemies. Courts and police harass me and my family using the taxes I pay. My in-laws suggested I commit suicide, so I am complying,” he stated.In his note, Subhash appealed for justice, asking that his wife and her family be kept away from his body. “My last rites shouldn’t be conducted until my harassers are punished. If they walk free, dump my ashes in a gutter near the court so I know how life is valued in this country,” he wrote.","Subhash Atul, a deputy general manager at an automobile firm, died by suicide in Bengaluru on Monday.
