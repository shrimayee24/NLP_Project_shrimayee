EC crackdown: 345 unrecognised parties face delisting; failed to contest polls or verify office locations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ec-crackdown-345-unrecognised-parties-face-delisting-failed-to-contest-polls-or-verify-office-locations/articleshow/122103552.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a move aimed at ‘cleaning the political space’, the Election Commission on Thursday initiated proceedings for delisting 345 regisered unrecognised political parties (RUPPs) that had failed to fulfil the statutory obligation of contesting even a single election in the last six years and the offices of which could not be located at the address mentioned in their registration documents.These 345 RUPPs are registered in different states and Union territories across the country.The Commission on Thursday said that it had come to its notice that of the over 2,800 RUPPs currently registered with ECI, many have failed to fulfil the essential conditions to maintain their registration status. “Thus, a nationwide exercise was conducted by the ECI to identify such RUPPs and 345 such RUPPs have been identified till now,” EC said in a statement. The review is ongoing and more such ‘non-compliant, inactive’ RUPPs may face delisting proceedings in the days to come.The chief electoral officers (CEOs) of the states/UTs where such “defaulter” RUPPs are registered, have been directed to issue show-cause notices, giving an opportunity to such parties to be heard. “The final decision regarding the delisting of any RUPP shall be taken by the Election Commission of India , based on the CEO’s report,” said an official.Political parties (National/State/RUPPs) in the country are registered with the ECI under the provisions of Section 29A of the Representation of the People Act 1951. Under this provision, any association, once registered as a political party, gets certain privileges and advantages such as tax exemptions amongst others.EC had in January 2024 made it mandatory for RUPPs to attach a declaration with their application for allotment of common poll symbol, confirming that they have filed their contribution reports and annual audit accounts for the last three financial years and election expenditure statement for the last two polls contested.Since 2022, the poll panel has delisted 284 defaulting and non-compliant RUPPs and declared 253 RUPPs inactive as part of its efforts to clean up the political space historically occupied by non-functional political parties. These parties were found to be availing benefits like 100% tax exemption on donations received without meeting the statutory requirements under the Representation of the People Act or contesting elections. Some were serving as shell companies or money laundering vehicles, while some others were fielding candidates in elections only to demand money from recognised parties for withdrawing their nomination.","The Election Commission on Thursday initiated proceedings for delisting 345 regisered unrecognised political parties. The parties had failed to fulfil the statutory obligation of contesting even a single election in the last six years.

In the pilot seat of 'Dragon', the Axiom-4 space capsule that would take a four member crew to the International Space Station on Thursday, was India's group captain Shubhanshu Shukla ""Namaskar, mere pyaare desh vasiyon,"" Shukla radioed to Earth minutes after entering space. ""What a ride! We are orbiting Earth at a velocity of 7.5km per second (27,000 kmph)."" Later, PM Modi congratulated the mission and posted that Shukla ""is on the way to become the first Indian to go to the ISS"".Shukla becomes the first Indian to cross the 'Karman line' in over 41 years, after Wing Commander Rakesh Sharma's flight on the Soviet Soyuz T-11 on April 3, 1984. Shukla's message from space - ""this isn't the beginning of my journey to ISS, but beginning of India's human space flight programme"" - reflects India's ambition to have its own space station by 2035 and crewed missions to Moon and beyond.After multiple postponements, Ax-4 mission lifted off Wednesday carrying commander Peggy Whitson (US), 65, mission pilot Shukla, 39, and mission specialists Sławosz Uznanski (Poland), 41, and Tibor Kapu (Hungary), 34, on a 14-day mission to ISS.Earlier, the symbolic ""crew handover"" took place. The four astronauts waved to their families before heading to the launchpad in a Tesla. Strapped into the Dragon capsule, the crew underwent final checks as the countdown proceeded.

A toy swan called Joy.But it's not just a toy. It has its roots in traditions of the scientific world. The practice of taking a toy into space to signal the onset of weightlessness started with Yuri Gagarin, the first person in space, and has since evolved into a longstanding tradition in space missions.Joy is a zero gravity indicator aboard the Axiom-4 mission. It was chosen by the astronauts as a tribute to astronaut Shubhanshu Shukla ’s son Kiash, who has a deep affection for animals.""We are here, not just the four of us, we also have with us our Zero-G indicator - Joy - that started to float with us just when we were injected into orbit. Joy is floating all over the capsule, sometimes we have to find him/ her here with us,"" Polish astronaut Slawosz Uznanski-Wisniewski said.Joy, the baby swan, represents the collective ambition of the Indian Space Research Organisation ( Isro ), the European Space Agency (ESA), and Hungary's HUNOR space program to reach beyond Earth, Axiom Space said in a statement.""In this way, Joy represents cultural unity as three nations realize the return to human spaceflight, together as one crew,"" it said.""By choosing a swan as the zero-g indicator, the Ax-4 crew celebrates the diversity of their cultures, united in the shared human experience of space exploration,"" Axiom Space said.Talking about the symbolism behind the swan, Shukla said, ""This means a lot more than just a ZeroG indicator. I think we all have symbolism, in Poland and Hungary and India as well.""In India, the swan is seen as a symbol of wisdom and purity, reflecting the quest for truth. In Poland, it represents qualities like purity, loyalty, and resilience.

ISS lessons to guide India in next chapter: Gaganyaan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/iss-lessons-to-guide-india-in-next-chapter-gaganyaan/articleshow/122102349.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Axiom-4 mission holds major significance for India's 'Gaganyaan' programme as the experience gained by Indian astronaut Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla during his trip to the International Space Station will help Isro fine-tune India's first human spaceflight mission, slated for early 2027.Though the four astronaut-designates for Gaganyaan - group captains Shukla, Prasanth Nair, Ajit Krishnan and Angad Pratap - have undergone training in Russia and India, none has first-hand space experience. Ax-4 will give Shukla an opportunity to experience life in an orbital station.During the 14-day ISS mission, Shukla will carry out seven India-led experiments, including research on seeds, algae and human physiology in microgravity, besides five experiments with Nasa. He will also get familiar with various crew systems aboard the ISS, gaining critical knowledge of how the station operates 400km above Earth.Once back, Shukla will share his learning with other Gaganyaan astronaut-designates. While the final crew for Gaganyaan is yet to be selected - two or three may be chosen - Shukla, armed with experience, is seen as a frontrunner.Space minister Jitendra Singh said Shukla's experiments will help advance space nutrition and self-sustaining life support systems for long-duration missions.One study involves understanding how space radiation affects edible microalgae - a promising food source for astronauts.Another experiment examines cyanobacteria like Spirulina and Synechococcus in microgravity, assessing their growth using nitrogen sources, including urea from human waste, to support recycling-based life systems. The experiments will use indigenously-developed biotech kits designed for microgravity. The effort will nurture a space biology ecosystem in India.Shukla will also interact with PM Modi, students, and industry leaders during the mission, showcasing India's growing capabilities in space.","Shubhanshu Shukla will carry out seven India-led experiments, including research on seeds, algae and human physiology in microgravity.

High Drama At SCO; Rajnath Refuses To Sign Document Sans Pahalgam | China Bails Out Pak?

India takes tough stand on terrorism

Doval trip

NEW DELHI: Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Friday met his Chinese counterpart Dong Jun in Qingdao and delivered a strong message on the future of bilateral ties between the two nations.The ministers held talks on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Defence Ministers' meeting.""Held talks with Admiral Dong Jun, the Defence Minister of China, on the sidelines of the SCO Defence Ministers' Meeting in Qingdao. We had a constructive and forward-looking exchange of views on issues about bilateral relations,"" Singh said in a social media post on Friday.Singh's visit to Qingdao coincided with the resumption of the Kailash Manasarovar Yatra in Tibet.It is taking place after a gap of nearly five years. The Kailash Mansarovar Yatra was suspended initially in 2020 because of the Covid-19 pandemic and subsequently because of the military standoff between the two sides on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh.""Expressed my happiness on the restarting of the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra after a gap of nearly six years,"" said Singh.""It is incumbent on both sides to maintain this positive momentum and avoid adding new complexities in the bilateral relationship,"" he added.Singh's visit to China came amid efforts by both New Delhi and Beijing to reset their ties following an understanding last October to end the military standoff along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh.The defence minister also presented a Madhubani painting from Bihar to his Chinese counterpart.This traditional art form, also known as Mithila painting, originates in Bihar’s Mithila region. It is characterised by intricate line drawings filled with bright colours, patterns, and tribal motifs. These paintings are popular for their vivid earthy tones and distinctive designs.Singh's statement comes a day after India took a firm stand at the SCO meeting by refusing to sign a joint statement that would have diluted India's position on critical issues, particularly concerning terrorism and regional security.Given the SCO norm stipulating consensus, the statement couldn't be adopted despite overnight talks, as Singh made it clear that perpetrators, organisers, financiers and sponsors of terror acts, including cross-border terrorism, must be held accountable.There can be no double standards on this, Singh said, speaking at the 10-nation SCO meet with his Pakistani and Chinese counterparts Khawaja Asif and Admiral Dong Jun, among others, in attendance.Singh rejected the statement after finding that Pakistan, with help of current SCO chair China, opposed mention of the Pahalgam massacre and instead wanted ""terrorist activities"" in Balochistan and the situation in J&K to figure in it.Speaking at the meet, Singh said peace and prosperity cannot co-exist with terrorism and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) in the hands of non-state actors and terror groups. ""Dealing with these challenges requires decisive action and we must unite in our fight against these evils for our collective safety and security,"" Singh said.In a clear reference to Pakistan, he said, ""Some countries use crossborder terrorism as an instrument of policy and provide shelter to terrorists. There should be no place for such double standards. SCO should not hesitate to criticise such nations.""On June 23, National Security Advisor Ajit Dovfal held a meeting with Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi in Beijing and reviewed recent developments in India-China relations and underscored the need to promote the overall development of the bilateral ties, including by fostering greater people-to-people ties.During the meeting, NSA Doval emphasised the need to counter terrorism in all its forms and manifestations to maintain peace and stability in the region. The two leaders also spoke about other bilateral, regional and global issues of mutual interest, according to the statement shared by the Ministry of External Affairs.",Defence minister Rajnath Singh met his Chinese counterpart Dong Jun in Qingdao.

'High': Shubhanshu Shukla answered his wife’s question about how his 'josh' was before lift off,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/high-shubhanshu-shukla-answered-his-wifes-question-about-how-his-josh-was-before-lift-off/articleshow/122102117.cms,"Just before he climbed into the Tesla that would ferry him to the launchpad in Florida’s predawn darkness on June 25, Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla had a brief moment with his wife. “How’s the josh?” she asked, echoing a line immortalised in Indian cinema. “High,” replied Shux.“We are a bit filmy that way,” Kamna told TOI with a laugh, speaking from Florida after her husband launched aboard the Axiom-4 (Ax-4) mission to the International Space Station (ISS). “There was very little time for conversation.”Along with their six-year-old son Kiash — fondly called Sid — Kamna, her brother’s family, and India’s Ambassador to the US, Vinay Mohan Kwatra, were the only ones from India to have spoken with Shukla just before launch.As SpaceX’s Falcon-9 cut through the night sky, little Sid, who was unaware of the momentous occasion, had dozed off. “I jolted Sid from sleep. He caught the launch. He was excited to watch what appeared like a Sun against a black backdrop,” Kamna recalled.The mission, a milestone for private spaceflight and a landmark for India’s human spaceflight journey, saw “Grace” — the Dragon capsule carrying Shukla and three international crewmates — dock successfully with the ISS.Kamna, who by then had reached Atlanta where her brother lives, was elated. “This is India’s time in space. Shux, me, and our entire family are looking forward to Gaganyaan , and the future of India’s human spaceflight programme,” she said.Though the family had their share of nerves when the mission was postponed multiple times, Kamna said there was “never any doubt that everything would be taken care of”.Now that Shukla is aboard the ISS, the family is scheduled to have two private video calls with him during his stay. “Those have been pre-arranged. But he can also call us whenever he’s free and it’s feasible,” Kamna said.As Shukla conducts cutting-edge Indian scientific experiments in orbit it is not just his mission, but a national moment. And behind the calm professionalism of an IAF pilot-turned-astronaut is a family that has been quietly sharing the journey every step of the way.In an exclusive interview to TOI earlier, Kamna had described Shux as the bravest person she knows and said she was confident that he’ll perform his duty as he always has.Ahead of launch Shukla had said: “No one travels to space alone… we do so on the shoulders of so many more. I feel grateful to each and every one of you. Thank you…” He had specially thanked his wife Kamna for being the wonderful partner that she was, and said: “Without you none of this was possible but more importantly none of this would matter.”",Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla is aboard the Axiom-4 (Ax-4) mission to the International Space Station.

Shiv Sena MP's driver gets Rs 150 crore land as 'gift' from Salar Jung kin,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/shiv-sena-mps-driver-gets-rs-150-crore-land-as-gift-from-salar-jung-kin/articleshow/122101820.cms,"CHHATRAPATI SAMBHAJINAGAR: A mysterious gift deed transferring ownership of a three-acre parcel of land in Maharashtra, valued at around Rs 150 crore, from descendants of Hyderabad's famous Salar Jung family to Shiv Sena MP Sandipanrao Bhumre's driver has triggered more than just incredulous surprise at his sudden turn of fortune.The Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar Police is investigating how Jawed Rasul Shaikh, who has been driving around the MP and his MLA son Vilas Bhumre for 13 years, is linked to the estate of the erstwhile Diwan of Hyderabad, Salar Jung.Jawed told TOI that he was cooperating with the inquiry and had already submitted the details investigators had asked for. ""I share good relations with the descendants of the Salar Jung family, so they gifted the land to me,"" he said.Police commissioner Pravin Pawar said Thursday that Jawed was summoned based on a complaint by a lawyer from Parbhani, flagging the ""hibanama"" (gift deed) in his name for what is regarded as ""prime land"" at Dawoodpura along Jalna Road in Sambhajinagar.""We will scan Jawed's income tax returns and details of any other source of income. He needs to explain why anyone from the Salar Jung family would make a gift deed in his name, giving away three acres in a prime location,"" inspector Sambhaji Pawar, part of the EOW team probing the land transfer, told TOI.Members of the Salar Jung family who signed the deed - Mir Mazhar Ali Khan and six of his relatives - are still to respond to EOW's notice to have their statements recorded, the officer said.Vilas, who represents Paithan constituency, protested against police allegedly dragging him and his father into the controversy over a land transfer deed in Jawed's name. ""EOW officials questioned me, too. Although Jawed is our driver, we don't have control over everything he does. In any case, hibanama is a legally valid process of gifting assets,"" he said.Several members of the Salar Jung family served as prime ministers to the erstwhile Nizams of Hyderabad.The gift deed executed by Mazhar Ali and six others states that they received their share of three out of 12 acres belonging to the clan at Bagsherganj in Dawoodpura after a prolonged litigation lasting till Jan 30, 2023. Police have found out that the gift deed in favour of Jawed was executed around the same time.Lawyer Mujahid Khan, whose complaint led EOW to initiate the probe, said his curiosity was piqued by the fact that Jawed wasn't even remotely related to the Salar Jung clan.""Why would the descendants of Salar Jung from Hyderabad give a gift deed to a person working as a driver in Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar, and that too after winning a legal battle for the same property. Also, a hibanama is legally valid only between blood relatives. The Salar Jung descendants and the driver are not only unrelated, they belong to two different sects of Islam.""Repeated calls to numbers belonging to members of the Salar Jung family went unanswered.","Jawed Rasul Shaikh is Shiv Sena MP Sandipanrao Bhumre's driver.

Nepal ambassador says issued advisory after scores of Nepalese youths rescued from captivity,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nepal-envoy-says-advisory-issued-after-nepalese-youths-rescued-from-captivity/articleshow/122100749.cms,"Nepal ambassador says issued advisory after scores of Nepalese youths rescued from captivity

DEHRADUN: Close to 60 men from Nepal have in recent days been rescued from months-long captivity by teams comprising officials in India, staff from the Nepal embassy and NGO workers after the youth — many of them minors — were trafficked into UP, Uttarakhand and Bihar by shady job networks. Those in the know say there could be “at least a thousand others”.??Nepal’s ambassador to India, Shankar P Sharma, told TOI on Thursday: “Kathmandu has issued an advisory to citizens to be cautious before taking job offers in India. We have received full cooperation from Indian agencies in the rescue of our citizens.” His remarks came amid widening investigations in Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, and Bihar, where similar rackets are suspected to be operating with impunity.Echoing the state’s stance, Uttarakhand home secretary Shailesh Bagauli told TOI, “Uttarakhand govt has always offered full cooperation to neighbouring countries like Nepal in such cases, and will continue to do so. We will take all necessary actions to ensure that such crimes are not committed in our state in future.”In the past week alone, 57 Nepalese nationals — 12 of them minors — were rescued from two towns in Uttarakhand.They had been confined in ordinary-looking homes in Rudrapur and Kashipur by a syndicate that police say operates under the guise of a marketing firm. The youths had been lured with promises of jobs as packaging agents or accountants, then confined, beaten and forced to recruit others into the same racket.Last Thursday, a dark staircase led Uttarakhand police into a three-room house tucked in a narrow, squalid alley in Kashipur. The first thing officers noticed was the silence. Inside, 35 young men sat on the floor with blank eyes and rigid shoulders. The windows were shut, the curtains drawn with bedsheets. The room smelled faintly of sweat and starch. Plastic plates with dried rice clung to the corners of the floor. None of the men spoke until a plainclothes officer touched one on the shoulder and said, in Nepali, “You are safe now.” One of them began to cry. The rest soon followed.The rescues were carried out by Uttarakhand police in collaboration with the Nepal embassy and KIN India, a group of Nepalese social workers based in Delhi who work on cases related to human trafficking. The chain of events had begun when one young man escaped captivity in Kashipur and alerted police in Nepal. He was later brought back across the border by KIN India to retrace his steps. What he revealed was a tightly managed operation where dozens of young men, stripped of phones and freedom, were being used as bait to pull in more victims.Four days later, on June 23, police found 22 more in a similar facility in Rudrapur, nine of them underage. Another 32 were discovered in Kashipur. Three men —Birendra Shahi, Sachin Kumar and Manish Tiwari — were arrested, and more are being investigated.“They had to hand over names and numbers — dozens of them. Friends, cousins, neighbours,” said Naveen Joshi, KIN India’s rescue and repatriation officer. “If they refused, they were beaten. It was systematic, coercive recruitment.”Anuj Kotwal, 18, a rescued youth from Sunsari, described the conditions inside. “A friend called me — he was already trapped but couldn’t tell me. I paid Rs 15,000 for what they called a processing fee. Once here, we were fed rice with water and turmeric, maybe salt. Potatoes were rare. We slept on floors and were told not to speak.” Anuj said he still hears the sound of the lock turning in his sleep.Rajesh, 19, from Dharan, had worked as a mason. He took the offer to support his newborn daughter. “They kept me locked for seven months. They beat me. They made me call my friends and lie to them. I thought I’d never go home.”Joshi said a syndicate was operating in India with a structure similar to cyberfraud compounds in Southeast Asia. “It resembles the Myanmar and Cambodia models run by Chinese groups,” he said. “This isn’t just trafficking—it’s industrialised fraud.”The rescued men were later escorted back to Nepal through the Gaddachauki border post. The Nepal embassy said it is working with Indian officials to ensure safe repatriation and further identify victims. Independent studies and UNODC data estimate that 100,000 to 200,000 Nepalese have been trafficked into India over the past decade, often under the pretext of employment.US Nagar SSP Manikant Mishra, who supervised the rescue, said, “A case has been registered under BNS sections for organised crime, wrongful confinement, kidnapping and conspiracy. Three individuals, including a Nepal citizen, have been arrested so far. The investigation is ongoing.”","Nepal ambassador says Kathmandu has issued advisory to citizens to be cautious before taking job offers in India.

Govt to cut by half toll rates for highways with more than 50% structures,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-to-cut-by-half-toll-rates-for-highways-with-more-than-50-structures/articleshow/122098900.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a decision that will benefit users of highways and bypasses that have structures — flyovers, underpasses and tunnels – accounting for more than 50% of their length, the toll rate for such stretches (with structures) will be halved and capped at five times the normal toll. Till now, the toll for stretches with structures was 10 times the normal toll.The road transport ministry has given the go-ahead for the change, which will be notified in the next couple of days. The new norm will bring relief to commuters using highway stretches linking two neighbouring cities, Ring roads and bypasses built by Central govt in urban areas, which usually have more such structures, as is the case with Dwarka Expressway in Delhi.As per current NH Fee Rules, the toll charge for every km of elevated stretch or tunnel is 10 times the user fee collected for a km of regular highway stretch. The formula is applied to recover the costs incurred to build elevated stretches and tunnels, which are more capital-intensive compared to regular highway sections.Citing an example, an official said a one-way car trip on the 28.5-km Dwarka Expressway having 21 km of structures will cost Rs 317 as per the present norm — Rs 306 for the structures portion and Rs 11 for the remaining 7 km -- but this will go down to around Rs 153, less than half, when the new norm is applied.While officials said that the change in rule may not have a huge impact on car users who opt for the Annual toll pass scheme for private cars that the govt will be implementing, it will benefit commercial and heavy vehicles.","Till now, the toll for stretches with structures was 10 times the normal toll.

"Space travel alters worldview, makes clear planet belongs to everyone: India's first spaceman Rakesh Sharma",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/space-travel-alters-worldview-makes-clear-planet-belongs-to-everyone-indias-first-spaceman-rakesh-sharma/articleshow/122098909.cms,"NEW DELHI: At a time when Indian astronaut Shubhanshu Shukla is in space as part of the Axiom-4 mission, India’s first spaceman Rakesh Sharma , who went there as part of the Indo-Soviet space programme in 1984, has said that space travel alters the mindset of humans and makes them see the world from a perspective that “this planet belongs to everyone” and is “not the sole preserve” of anyone.“We really need to preserve what we have, which means we need to end conflicts, we need to forget about our weapons, we need to forget about confrontation and we need to start collaborating instead,” he said in a recorded podcast shared by ministry of defence on the day India returned to space after 41 years.After more than a year-long training in the erstwhile USSR, Sharma, an IAF test pilot, was launched into space along with two Russian cosmonauts, where he spent over a week in orbit on the Salyut-7 space station in 1984. “Because I was a test pilot when the selection happened… that time I was young, I was fit, and I had the qualification, so I was lucky enough to have been chosen. Then, after selection, we moved to Star City, just outside Moscow, for our training. The training went on for 18 months and culminated in the Indo-Soviet spaceflight in 1984. It was an eight-day mission, and we carried out experiments which were designed by Indian scientists,"" he said.Sharma recalled that the entire training and communication with crew members and mission control while they were in orbit was in Russian. “We had to learn the language before we started training, and that was not easy because of the paucity of time. So, we took about two months to learn the language,” he said.He highlighted that in space, sunrises and sunsets happen at an interval of 45 minutes as “we moved around Earth in just 90 minutes”, and saw day and night several times in a day.In the podcast released on Wednesday night, the spaceman said that while space travel technology has changed, “as humans, we haven't changed much”. “The mental impact will always be there because humans will be able to get a different perspective. It does kind of alter the worldview... (shows) the vast place in the universe.” Sharma had famously said “Sare Jehan Se Acha...” when then PM Indira Gandhi asked him how India looked from space.Asked about the future of Indian space travel, he said, “We will be going farther and farther from planet Earth... Space tourism will happen but space exploration will go side by side and we will keep marching ahead”.On India’s uniqueness, Sharma said: “We shared our Vedas with everybody. Our heritage says ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam (The world is one family)’. We still value it in the modern world as during Covid epidemic, we shared (vaccines) with everybody...”.When asked how he found the world and India from space, Sharma exclaimed, “Oh dear! Beautiful. In our country, we got everything: we got a long coastline, the ghats section, plains, tropical forests, mountains, Himalayas. It's a beautiful sight, different colours, different textures”.After his return from the mission, Sharma went back to the IAF from where he retired as wing commander. “After a few years, I moved to Hindustan Aeronautics Limited as their chief test pilot,” he said, and recalled his association with the evolution of the Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) ‘Tejas’ fighter jet. “Later I joined the IT industry. Life has been rewarding for me.”","India's first spaceman Rakesh Sharma says space travel alters the mindset of humans.

He said before the attack, the pace of registration was encouraging, with around 2.36 lakh pilgrims signing up for the yatra, which concludes on Aug 9.The LG said the Shri Amarnath Shrine Board (SASB) had launched a re-verification programme for pilgrims who had registered before the April 22 Pahalgam attack. “So far 85,000 pilgrims have reconfirmed their registration after consultation with SASB,” he said, and hoped the numbers would go up in the coming days.Sinha unveiled the security plan, reassuring devotees about safety, and also gave the details of the upgraded infrastructure along the routes to ensure a smooth and safe pilgrimage.He said a multi-layered security grid had been put in place, with increased deployment of the Army, Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs), and J&K Police.“Integrated command and control centres have been set up, and vulnerable spots have been identified for focused security measures,” he said. He advised the pilgrims to move in the designated convoys for safety reasons. Even those coming in their own vehicles were advised to move in convoys, he maintained.Several new initiatives had been introduced, including a comprehensive insurance scheme covering not just the yatris, but also ponywallas and other service providers, the LG said. However, helicopter service had been suspended this year due to recent chopper accidents and security concerns, he revealed. He added that this would not affect the overall flow of the yatra as only a small percentage of pilgrims used the helicopter service.Sinha said SASB had developed several pilgrim-centric amenities over the past two years, including widening of both the yatra routes to around 12ft along most stretches. Safer yatra tracks have been prepared with stronger safety handrails all along the Baltal track and over 20 km on vulnerable stretches on the Pahalgam track. He said the tracks and camps would have power connectivity till the holy cave and from there to Panjtarni.There will be enhanced accommodation for pilgrims at SASB’s Yatri Niwas complexes at Baltal (800), Nunwan (900) and Pantha chowk (1000). “Digital pre-paid systems for hiring of various services like pony, pithu and palki will be available for pilgrims,” he added.At the holy cave, the wooden darshan platform has been replaced with a stainless steel platform with wood flooring. “Now, pilgrims would be able to have darshans simultaneously in four rows. This shall facilitate better and hassle-free darshans,” he added.Responding to a query whether he will allow the elected govt to have a say in the yatra’s administrative affairs, the LG said he would be holding a separate meeting with chief minister Omar Abdullah to discuss the matter.He said people of Kashmir had always welcomed Amarnath yatris with warmth and unparalleled hospitality. “There is no alternative to the Kashmiri spirit of welcome. Let us continue this tradition and ensure the yatra is safe, peaceful and successful for all,” he added.","Jammu and Kashmir LG Manoj Sinha on Thursday assured full security for the yatra, which is set to begin on July 3.

NEW DELHI: The RSS on Thursday urged a review of the words ‘socialist’ and ‘secular’ in the Constitution’s preamble, citing they were added during the Emergency and not included in the Constitution drafted by BR Ambedkar.RSS general secretary Dattatreya Hosabole was addressing an event marking 50 years of the Emergency and said, “Babasaheb Ambedkar never used these words in the preamble of the Constitution. The words were added during the Emergency, when fundamental rights were suspended, Parliament did not function, and the judiciary became lame.""He said that discussions were previously held on this issue, but no concrete outcome was achieved regarding the removal of these words. ""So whether they should remain in the preamble should be considered,” said Hosabole.Taking a jab at the Congress, Hosable demanded an apology for the excesses committed during the Emergency era which witnessed large-scale forced sterilisation, incarceration of people, and the curtailment of the freedom of judiciary and press, he recalled.""Those who did such things are today moving around with Constitution's copy.They have still not apologised... Apologise,"" he said.Earlier on Tuesday, union home minister Amit Shah had called the Emergency which was imposed on June 25, 1975, a “dark chapter” and said that the “nation never bows down to dictatorship”. Shah asserted that the Modi government has decided to observe June 25 as “Samvidhan Hatya Diwas” annually across the nation.The Emergency had altered key elements such as the Preamble and the Constitution, weakening the Judiciary and suspending democratic rights, Shah had said.The Union Cabinet on Wednesday had passed a resolution denouncing the Emergency imposed by former prime minister Indira Gandhi. The Cabinet held a meeting chaired by prime minister Narendra Modi and observed a two minute silence as a “tribute to those whose constitutionally guaranteed democratic rights were taken away and who were then subjected to unimaginable horrors.”",RSS urges a review of the words ‘socialist’ and ‘secular’ in the Constitution’s preamble.

Tesla shake-up: Who is Omead Afshar? Senior executive reportedly fired by Elon Musk amid slumping sales in key markets,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/tesla-shake-up-who-is-omead-afshar-senior-executive-fired-by-elon-musk-amid-slumping-sales-in-key-markets/articleshow/122103380.cms,"File photo: Omead Afshar (left) and Elon Musk (Picture credit: X, ANI)

Who is Omead Afshar?

Omead Afshar, one of Elon Musk ’s closest aides and Tesla’s vice president of manufacturing and operations, has been reportedlyfired by Musk as the electric vehicle maker grapples with declining sales across North America and Europe.According to CNBC, Afshar’s termination comes just days before the end of the second quarter, amid ongoing pressure from investors following Tesla’s fifth consecutive monthly sales drop in Europe and a 15% decline in deliveries in China.Afshar’s dismissal marks the latest high-profile exit from Tesla following the recent departure of Milan Kovac, head of the company’s Optimus humanoid robotics program.Afshar had been leading a critical team overseeing Tesla’s business across major markets, including executives in sales and policy.His ouster comes at a time when Tesla’s brand has also taken a reputational hit, partly due to Musk’s controversial political positions and the underperformance of the Cybertruck. Analysts are forecasting a global drop of at least 10% in Tesla’s Q2 deliveries. The stock is down 19% this year.Often described as “Musk’s fixer,” Afshar was one of the most powerful and trusted executives within Elon Musk’s business empire.According to Forbes, he began his journey with Tesla as an engineer in 2011 and rose through the ranks to eventually become vice president, overseeing operations in North America and Europe.An American citizen born to Iranian parents, Afshar studied biomedical engineering with a focus on mechanical engineering at the University of California, Irvine.Known for his perfectionism and operational discipline, Afshar gained Musk’s trust early on and became involved in some of Tesla’s most high-stakes projects.He played a key role in building Tesla’s massive Gigafactory in Austin, Texas, a project that solidified his reputation for delivering under pressure.In 2022, he was the subject of an internal probe over the acquisition of rare construction materials, including speciality glass, for a secretive Musk-led initiative, as reported by Bloomberg.Following that investigation, he worked briefly at SpaceX, where he was later promoted to vice president before returning to Tesla.Afshar also had a hand in Musk’s 2022 acquisition of Twitter, now known as X. According to ET, he helped implement cost-cutting measures during the platform’s restructuring.Despite his abrupt firing, Afshar continued praising Musk on social media in recent days, calling the robotaxi pilot launch in Austin “absolutely historic” and thanking the CEO “for pushing us all.”His influence was such that The Wall Street Journal once described him as one of the few insiders who could both understand and execute Musk’s most ambitious visions.","Omead Afshar, Tesla's vice president of manufacturing and operations, has been reportedly fired by Elon Musk.

Microsoft sued by authors for allegedly using pirated books to train AI model,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/microsoft-sued-by-authors-for-allegedly-using-pirated-books-to-train-ai-model/articleshow/122088854.cms,"Authors accuse Microsoft of copyright infringement

Lawsuit demands damages and a court injunction

Legal backdrop: A turning point in AI copyright battles

Microsoft yet to respond publicly

A growing challenge for the AI industry





A group of prominent authors, including Pulitzer Prize winner Kai Bird and New Yorker writer Jia Tolentino, has filed a lawsuit against Microsoft, accusing the tech giant of illegally using pirated versions of their books to train its AI model known as “Megatron. ” Filed in a New York federal court on June 25, the suit claims that Microsoft copied nearly 200,000 copyrighted works without permission to develop AI systems that mimic the authors’ unique writing styles, themes, and voices. This marks another major legal challenge in the growing debate over AI training and copyright law.The plaintiffs allege that Microsoft used a massive dataset of pirated digital books to train Megatron, a generative AI model designed to produce human-like text. According to the complaint, the AI’s ability to replicate the tone, syntax, and narrative patterns of copyrighted works demonstrates a clear violation of intellectual property rights. The authors argue that their creative output was exploited to build a product that competes with them in the marketplace, without their consent or compensation.The writers are seeking statutory damages of up to $150,000 per infringed work, along with a court order to block Microsoft from continuing its alleged unauthorised use of their materials.While the exact number of infringed titles remains unclear, the plaintiffs claim that thousands of authors’ works may have been used without licence or attribution. The case could set a precedent for how courts handle AI training involving copyrighted content.This lawsuit comes just one day after a California judge ruled that AI firm Anthropic may have made “fair use” of copyrighted material in training but could still be liable for using pirated versions of books. It was the first US decision to address the legality of using copyrighted texts in generative AI development. The Microsoft case adds further momentum to a wave of lawsuits from writers, artists, and media outlets challenging how their work is used by tech companies.According to Reuters, Microsoft has not issued an official response to the allegations. A spokesperson for the company declined to comment when contacted by reporters. Meanwhile, legal observers say this case will be closely watched for its implications on the future of AI development and intellectual property rights.Tech firms including Meta, OpenAI, and Anthropic have all faced similar legal scrutiny in recent time. The central argument from the companies is that using public data for AI training qualifies as “fair use” under US copyright law. However, rights holders argue that this approach undermines creators' control and devalues their work. As AI models become increasingly sophisticated, courts should define clearer boundaries around what constitutes ethical and legal data usage.","Lawsuit demands damages and a court injunction against Microsoft.

Bumble’s latest layoffs mark second major cut in 2 years



Dating app giant Bumble has announced that it will lay off approximately 240 employees, representing 30% of its global workforce. Despite the significant staff reduction, shares of the company surged by 16% in premarket trading following the news, reports said.According to news agency Reuters, the company anticipates incurring non-recurring charges between $13 million and $18 million for employee severance, benefits, and related expenses, primarily in the third and fourth quarters of 2025.Bumble expects these layoffs to result in annual cost savings of around $40 million, which it plans to reinvest into key areas like product and technology development.Bumble also raised its second-quarter revenue forecast to a range of $244 million to $249 million, an increase from its previous outlook of $235 million to $243 million.A Bumble spokesperson said that the layoffs were “not made lightly.”“Our focus now is on moving forward in a way that strengthens our core business, continues to serve our members effectively, and positions us for future growth,” the spokesperson said, according to CNBC.Bumble’s job cuts are part of a reconfiguration of its “operating structure to optimise execution on its strategic priorities.”This latest job cuts follows a previous significant reduction in February of last year (2024), when the company laid off around 350 employees, representing 37% of its workforce. The 2024 layoffs followed a disappointing first-quarter revenue and a challenging economic environment characterised by a slowdown in user spending.At the time, Bumble stated its intention to “reduce its global workforce by approximately 350 roles to better align its operating model with future strategic priorities and to drive stronger operating leverage.”Bumble joins a growing list of tech giants, including Microsoft , Amazon, and Intel, that have cited various reasons for workforce reductions this year, contributing to a broader trend of significant shifts in the sector.","Bumble has announced that it will lay off approximately 240 employees, representing 30% of its global workforce.

70% of Indian teens spend 7 hours online: ISKCON monk warns of mental health fallout

A spiritual path grounded in scientific wisdom



Gauranga Das’s unique approach to leadership



Books that bridge the gap between worlds



The Art of Resilience

The Art of Focus

In a moment that appealed to seekers of spirituality as well as tech enthusiasts, there was an unforgettable exchange between Google CEO Sundar Pichai and ISKCON monk Gauranga Das at the India Global Forum 2025 in London. The discussion between them, which had started lively with a jocular remark about being youthful, soon turned into an introspective discussion on the stark contrast between corporate stress and spiritual tranquility.Gauranga Das, a graduate from IIT Bombay, who now heads programs in sustainable living and spiritual education, used the moment to highlight some of the most pressing concerns of our digital times - mental health and the increasing digital addiction epidemic.The difference between these two IIT graduates was more than physical or professional; it was philosophical. While one sits at the head of one of the most influential tech giants in the world, the other has dedicated his life to leading people to inner understanding and spiritual direction. The meeting wasn't merely a reunion; it was a comparison of two radically different directions based on the same intellectual heritage. It was an effective metaphor for the decisions contemporary society must make today: progress without equilibrium, or innovation backed by internal wellness.Gauranga Das and Sundar Pichai, though having started at the same time at IIT, followed different career paths early on in life. Pichai went into technology and became the CEO of Google, a company that is at the heart of the digital revolution. Das instead went down the path of spiritual discovery and service, becoming an ISKCON member and dedicating himself to bringing ancient wisdom into modern settings.Their meeting at the India Global Forum 2025 was noticed when Pichai noted the way young Gauranga Das looked compared to his age. Das responded with an answer that went viral instantly for its simplicity and profundity:This one sentence highlighted a wider discussion regarding what it means to live from purpose rather than performance. It also spawned a wider debate regarding how spiritual tools can assist with coping with rising levels of stress inflicted as a result of round-the-clock digital interaction.In his address to the forum, Gauranga Das reported shocking statistics regarding digital addiction, specifically social media. Based on the information he provided, more than 230 million individuals globally are addicted to social media. In India alone, 70% of adolescents spend as much as seven hours per day on the net, a figure that indicates increasing worry for parents, teachers, and mental health professionals.Das linked these figures to the wider problem of declining mental health worldwide. Referring to world trends, he identified that one in seven individuals is presently suffering from some sort of mental health difficulty. These are anxiety, depression, sleep disorders, and chronic stress; maladies that are increasingly being attributed to excessive exposure to digital content and a mindfulness deficit in daily life.This was not simply an attack on technology, but a call to awaken to how we engage with it. Das leveraged the platform to promote a more holistic digital life, one that includes frequent breaks, mindful use, and spiritual anchoring.Gauranga Das is not only a monk who has spiritual wisdom; he is also an engineer who has been trained and who has a deep understanding of how technology functions and how it may affect human psychology. This makes him uniquely qualified in matters that lie at the interface between science and spirituality.Das is also a senior member of the Governing Body Commission of ISKCON and the director of Govardhan Ecovillage (GEV), a green living community that was established under the inspiration of Radhanath Swami. GEV is not only an ashram, it is a widely acclaimed model of how to apply ancient wisdom to modern sustainability practices. It won the UN World Tourism Organization Award in 2017, and it is also accredited with key United Nations organisations such as UNEP, ECOSOC, UNCCD, and CBD.Under Das's stewardship, GEV has turned into an exemplar of the way communities can be in harmony with nature yet maintain essential spiritual principles. It should not be astonishing that numerous young professionals, such as engineers, physicians, and policy makers, now journey to the Ecovillage for leadership training and retreats.Aside from his work in the Ecovillage, Gauranga Das also heads the Govardhan School of Public Leadership, an institution that prepares wannabe civil servants of India. The founder created the school to develop resilient leaders imbued with ethical values by the integration of Vedic wisdom alongside contemporary public policy training.Das also leads the Bhaktivedanta Research Centre, where ancient manuscripts are kept, translated, and analysed in academic contexts. This centre offers postgraduate studies in philosophy and comparative religion, providing students access to systems of knowledge that are both ancient and extremely useful today. The curriculum combines ancient insights with modern administrative frameworks, helping students navigate complexity, uncertainty, and moral dilemmas in real-world governance and social impact roles.Through such platforms, Das prioritises staying resilient, focused, and mentally clear; qualities that are typically undervalued in demanding corporate settings but are key to sustained success and satisfaction.To make spiritual insights more common, Gauranga Das has written two influential books:Both books borrow from scriptures such as the Bhagavad Gita but touch on very contemporary issues like office burnout, distraction, and individual discontentment. These books have spoken to spiritual seekers as well as working professionals seeking down-to-earth, real-life counsel on surviving life's stress.In interviews and talks, Das has consistently emphasised that spiritual tools are not exclusive to monks or renunciants. They are equally relevant to CEOs, students, and anyone navigating the complexities of modern life.",Google CEO Sundar Pichai and ISKCON monk Gauranga Das met at the India Global Forum 2025 in London. The pair discussed the stark contrast between corporate stress and spiritual tranquility. Das is not only a monk who has spiritual wisdom; he is also an engineer who has a deep understanding of how technology functions.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122067493,imgsize-39158,width-400,resizemode-4/Sundar-Pichais-IIT-batchmate-Gauranga-Das-who-turned-monk-looks-younger-than-him.jpg"

""The flight landed safely in Mumbai where our medical teams were ready to provide immediate medical assistance. After landing, two passengers and two cabin crew, who continued to feel unwell, were taken to the medical room for further examination and were later discharged. We are investigating the incident and have duly notified the regulator.""A source said a cabin depressurisation problem could cause lower levels of oxygen in the passenger cabin, but then oxygen masks drop from the overhead panel, which didn't happen during this flight.""So, drop in cabin pressurisation is not likely to be the cause."" Food poisoning appears to be the more likely cause, said the source.The pilots of the flight were not affected. ""Pilots get their meal after the passengers have been served. They get the same food as the passengers. Earlier, the commander and the first officer would get separate meal trays, which came from two different kitchens.

GURGAON: A 74-year-old retired bank manager watering plants fell 14 floors to his death after stepping onto a corroded portion of an iron bridge that connected two towers of a residential complex in Faridabad Sector 88 on Tuesday morning.Police said no sooner had Khulwant Singh stepped on the rusted portion of the bridge, it gave way, sending him plummeting to the ground below through the gap. He landed face down and his hands and head were severed. The bridge where Singh was tending to plants connected Towers 8 and 9 of RPS Savana society.Originally from Himachal Pradesh, Singh had been living in the society with his only son Harshit, an IT engineer, daughter-in-law, and grandchildren after his wife passed away a few years ago. He had two daughters living abroad. A police team that reached the society took custody of the body and sent it for an autopsy.The bridge, originally designed as a fire escape, had been repurposed by residents as a makeshift garden. Police officials pointed out that regular watering of plants, combined with rain, had accelerated the bridge's corrosion over time.The structure, made of iron with tile blocks, had been showing visible signs of rust, particularly in areas where plants were maintained.""The continuous exposure to water, both from flowerpots and natural weather conditions, had severely compromised the bridge's structural integrity,"" said Arvind, the SHO of BPTP police station.At the time of the incident around 8.30am, Singh's family members were inside their flat. Despite retiring from State Bank of India 15 years ago, he was known in the community for his active lifestyle.SHO Arvind said Singh's family had lodged a complaint, alleging lack of maintenance despite the iron structure rusting away. ""We are investigating the matter from all angles, including possible negligence by the society's RWA, which is responsible for maintenance,"" he added.Other residents, too, complained of maintenance issues at RPS Savana. ""There are issues with the quality of construction too. We have been pointing this out to the developer from the moment we bought our flats, but to no avail,"" said a resident.An RWA member said residents had been asked to not place pots on the bridge. ""We are deeply saddened by the demise of Singh ji. It's an extremely unfortunate incident. However, we have been asking residents to not keep anything on the bridge that hamper emergency rescue efforts,"" he added. Police officials said they planned to question RWA members and examine other safety loopholes, if any.","Khulwant Singh, 74, fell 14 floors to his death after stepping onto a corroded portion of an iron bridge.

Walmart Inc President and CEO Doug McMillon emphasized the company's desire for a level playing field and consistent policies in all countries where it operates, stating that Walmart is well-equipped to navigate the current tariff challenges better than any other retailer. ""We operate in many countries, and we consistently ask for a level playing field everywhere,"" McMillon told the Economic Times when questioned about India. ""We engage with various governments, sharing our views on changes needed to better serve customers, but we don't set the rules—we comply with them.""Talking about the goal for India market, Doug McMillion said, Walmart will announce the next goal for India once it reaches the target of annually sourcing goods worth $10 billion from the country by 2027. He went on to highlight Walmart's preference for local sourcing and job creation, noting, ""We like to buy locally, create jobs, and benefit from shorter lead times, especially for food and consumables."" Media reports suggest that the Trump administration is pushing India to grant full access to its $125 billion e-commerce market for companies like Amazon and Walmart as part of ongoing bilateral trade agreement (BTA) negotiations, expected to conclude by next month.

Protesters Erupt Over Jeff Bezos’ Lavish Venice Wedding Bash, Greenpeace Sends Fiery Message

One of the most-expensive divorce in the history

Sexts that ended Jezz Bezos first marriage

What divorce lawyers say

Billionaire Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, the world’s fourth-richest person with a net worth of $223.7 billion, is set to marry longtime girlfriend Lauren Sánchez in a three-day Venetian wedding extravaganza starting June 24, estimated to cost over $10 million. Dubbed the “wedding of the century,” the nuptials have sparked widespread interest, not only for their opulence but also for the intricate legal protections surrounding the union.Bezos and Sanchez, a former news anchor and founder of an aerial production company, announced their engagement in 2023. However, their wedding plans were reportedly delayed from an initial winter 2024 date in Aspen due to prolonged negotiations over a prenuptial agreement, according to The Hollywood Reporter. An insider claimed Bezos’ legal team insisted on finalizing the prenup before proceeding, though Bezos denied the Aspen wedding rumor via a post on Twitter. According to a report in Vanity Fair too, some lingering financial trauma from Bezos' first divorce pushed the couple's wedding by few months.The prenup is a focal point given Bezos’ costly 2019 divorce from MacKenzie Scott, his wife of 25 years and Amazon’s first employee. That split, one of the most expensive in history, saw Scott receive over $38 billion in Amazon shares. e divorce included explosive cheating allegations that accused Bezos of having an affair with now-fiancée Sanchez. The absence of a prenup in Bezos’ first marriage has made legal safeguards a priority this time around.The Venetian celebration marks a new chapter for Bezos and Sánchez, whose relationship began under public scrutiny but has since blossomed into a high-profile romance. As the couple prepares to say “I do,” their legal agreements ensure that Bezos’ vast fortune remains protected, underscoring the complexities of love and wealth at the pinnacle of global finance.Jeff Bezos and his first wife, the novelist MacKenzie Scott, were married back in 1993; Scott is said to have helped get Amazon off the ground, but their 25-year marriage ended in 2019 after the tabloid The Enquirer published leaked sexts between Bezos and Sanchez — revealing their romantic affair. The Bezos-Scott separation became one of the highest-dollar divorces in history, fracturing the pair's fortune and leaving Scott with tens of billions of dollars and Amazon shares.High-profile divorce attorney Robert Cohen, who has represented clients like Melinda French Gates, told Fortune that billionaires like Bezos often seek prenups after experiencing contentious divorces. “They’ve likely been through a nightmare before… and they don’t want to do that again,” Cohen said.Sánchez, who was previously married to Patrick Whitesell until 2019, also signed a prenup in her first marriage, which facilitated a smooth division of assets. She shares two children with Whitesell, while Bezos has four children with Scott.","Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is set to marry longtime girlfriend Lauren Sánchez in a three-day Venetian wedding extravaganza starting June 24.

Mukesh Ambani on what he told Reliance Board about analysts' warning on Jio that he calls the biggest risk taken by Reliance Group so far: In the worst case scenario ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/mukesh-ambani-on-what-he-told-reliance-board-about-analysts-warning-on-jio-that-he-calls-the-biggest-risk-taken-by-reliance-group-so-far-in-the-worst-case-scenario-/articleshow/122082927.cms,"File picture: Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani (PTI Photo)

Mukesh Ambani, chairman of Reliance Industries , India’s largest private-sector conglomerate, revealed insights into his leadership philosophy and the company’s bold approach to innovation during a recent interview for the Leading Asia series. Speaking to McKinsey, Mukesh Ambani discussed how a clear vision, coupled with the right talent, has helped Reliance grow from a modest textiles business into a global leader in innovation and value creation. The Leading Asia series features in-depth conversations with the region’s most influential leaders, exploring the strategies behind their ambitious goals.Highlighting the company’s willingness to take risks, Ambani pointed to the launch of Reliance Jio as a defining moment. ""We’ve always taken big risks because, for us, scale is important. The biggest risk we have taken so far was Jio. At the time, it was our own money that we were investing, and I was the majority shareholder,"" he said. Despite skepticism from analysts about India’s readiness for advanced digital technology, Ambani invested heavily in Jio, viewing it as a potential game-changer. “In the worst case, we will not earn much return. That’s okay because it’s our own money,” he told his board. “But this will be the best philanthropy we’ve ever done because we will have digitized India and transformed the country.”Ambani said that his leadership idea is rooted in a long-term perspective, inspired by his father’s vision of Reliance as an enduring institution. “You come without anything into this world, and you leave without taking anything with you. What you leave behind is an institution,” he said, recalling his father’s words. With Reliance approaching its golden jubilee in 2027, Ambani expressed confidence that the company will continue to serve India and humanity for a century and beyond.Reflecting on Reliance’s evolution, Ambani noted its ability to adapt to a rapidly changing world. “The Reliance of the 1960s and ’70s is completely different from the Reliance of the 2000s and 2020s,” he said. By challenging traditional business school principles, such as avoiding integration across the value chain, Reliance has seized emerging technological opportunities, often surpassing its existing ventures in scale and impact.","Mukesh Ambani, chairman of Reliance Industries, revealed insights into his leadership philosophy and the company’s bold approach to innovation.

How judge Aman Gupta may have agreed with the 70 hour work week



Shark Tank India recently posted a teaser of the upcoming fifth season of the show on Instagram. The now viral teaser takes a sly dig at the 70-hour work week comment made by Infosys co-founder Narayana Murthy. The promo can be seen mocking the long working hours, but it also draws parallels with Shark Tank India judge Aman Gupta who recently expressed his views on intense work dedication.Earlier this year, Infosys co-founder Narayana Murthy suggested that Indians should work for 70 hours a week as this will boost the country's productivity and economy. Now, the new teaser of Shark Tank India show takes a dig at this viewpoint with its new promo.Shark Tank India season five promo released by SonyLiv features fictional company CEOs who are disappointed with their employees starting their own businesses. The voice over in the background urges viewers to “keep working so your millionaire bosses become billionaires,” and warns them not to apply for the fifth season of the show.The teaser simply conveys the message that don’t give up on your dreams for corporate burnout .The new promo of the show aligns with the viewpoints of some of the judges on show. Recently, Shark Tank India judge Namita Thapar publicly criticized the concept of a 70-hour work week. Thapar said that the idea of a 70-hour work week is unsustainable and is not good for the well-being of the professional. She also advocates the ideal of work-life balance . Anupam Mittal, another judge on the show also weighed in with a sarcastic remark about AI potentially eliminating jobs, easing concerns about long work hours.However, not all the judges on the show disagree with this sentiment of long working hours. Recently, Boat co-founder and Shark Tank India judge Aman Gupta acknowledged the significant time he dedicated to building his business, which inevitably meant less time for his family, particularly during his daughter's formative years.Speaking on the podcast Prakhar Ke Pravachan, Gupta said, “I know I have missed out on many things in my daughter’s life. If I look back now, I realise how many events I have missed. However, I am very much okay with it and I don’t regret it at all.” He added, “Had I not missed out on those occasions, my life would have been much different.”However, Gupta mentioned that these sacrifices were important and necessary for him to succeed. ""I'm very much okay with it. I don't regret it at all. Had I not missed out on those important occasions, my life would have been much different,"" he explained. He further added, ""I worked very hard and that is the reason I'm where I am. I must have missed out on many things in life, but that is what it takes to reach such a level.""","Shark Tank India recently posted a teaser of the upcoming fifth season of the show on Instagram.
