Breaching 1.5 degree C temp. rise threshold doesn’t mean the Paris Agreement is dead: WMO chief,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/breaching-1-5-degree-c-temp-rise-threshold-doesnt-mean-the-paris-agreement-is-dead-wmo-chief/articleshow/117251923.cms,"NEW DELHI: World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) secretary-general Celeste Saulo on Tuesday said the global average temperature rise breaching the Paris Agreement threshold of 1.5 degree Celsius in 2024 doesn’t mean the global climate deal is dead.She while referring to the average global temperature rise of 1.55 degree C in 2024 over the pre-industrial (1850-1900) period, however, termed the rise a “very grave danger” and called for decisive climate action in 2025 to reduce greenhouse gases and speed up the transition to renewable energy.Saulo was addressing the 150th foundation day celebration which was attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, minister of earth science Jitendra Singh, IMD chief Mrutyunjay Mohapatra and meteorologists from India and many countries including Japan, Singapore and Oman.Representatives of Pakistan did not attend it despite sending their prior confirmation while Bangladesh had declined its participation in advance citing restrictions on non-essential foreign travel at government expense.Saulo's remark on the occasion means the breaching of warming levels referred to in the Paris Agreement should be understood as temperature rise over an extended period, typically decades or longer.

NEW DELHI: """", ""between Congress and BJP "", ""Friends every morning and fight at night"" ... the knives are out as the three-way battle for Delhi gets bigger and bitter.The ruling AAP , which faces an aggressive BJP and a belligerent Congress in its pursuit for a third consecutive term, has accused its political rivals of being hand in glove Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday claimed that the February 5 elections would expose the 'jugalbandi' going on behind the scenes between the Congress and the BJP for years.The AAP supremo was reacting to a post by Amit Malviya, which the BJP IT department head had made in response to Kejriwal's attack on Rahul Gandhi When Kejriwal responded to Rahul Gandhi's attacks on him with a dig ""I am working to save the country, he is fighting to save the Congress"", BJP leader Amit Malviya used this response to take a swipe at the AAP chief and advised him to first save his New Delhi assembly seat and worry about the country later.Kejriwal who has represented the New Delhi seat since 2013 is pitted against BJP's Parvesh Verma and Congress leader Sandeep Dikshit this time.In fact, Congress candidate Sandeep Dikshit reacting sharply to Kejriwal's remarks, questioned the AAP chief's integrity. ""Which country is he saving? When you swindled Rs 2,000 crore in the liquor policy, were you saving the country? When you claimed you wouldn’t buy a bungalow and instead moved into a luxurious Rs 30-32 crore palace, were you saving the country? When you were secretly helping the BJP win in Haryana, Goa, and Uttarakhand, were you saving the country? And when you failed to clean the drains, failed to provide water, and polluted Delhi’s air, were you saving the country then?"" Dikshit questioned.The verbal duel between friends-turned-rivals sharpened on Tuesday as Rahul Gandhi continued with his relentless attacks on the AAP government taunting Kejriwal's model of governance in the national capital.A day after comparing Kejriwal to Prime Minister Narendra Modi over fake promises, Rahul today launched a campaign to ""expose"" AAP government's empty and hollow promises of transforming Delhi into a world-class city.""Dekho, dilli dekho, yeh hai chamkati hui dilli. Paris jaisi dilli ... sab jagah yahi haal hai” (See the city, this is Delhi, this is shining Delhi, the Delhi which looks like Paris), Rahul was heard saying on camera as he visited Delhi’s Rithala area to showcase the glaring gaps between the AAP government’s promises and reality on the ground.Meanwhile, the BJP seems to be enjoying this war of words between the two INDIA bloc partners.Madhya Pradesh cabinet minister Kailash Vijayvargiya took a potshot at the Congress vs AAP tussle and said that they (Congress) make friends in the morning and fight at night.""Sometimes they (Congress) shake hands and sometimes they break each other's hands. It is their culture (sanskaar). Sometimes they join hands with West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee and sometimes Mamata ji abuses them and again they abuse Mamata ji. Similarly, sometimes they join hands with Akhilesh Yadav, then leave hands and abuse each other,"" Vijayvargiya said.""These are the kind of people, who make friends every morning and fight at night. Now whether these people abuse or praise is not important, the public knows everything,"" he added.And it's not just the BJP that is attacking the Congress. On Tuesday, Sharad Pawar, one of the key architects of the INDIA bloc, also sided with Arvind Kejriwal in the Delhi battle joining the likes of Mamata Banerjee and Akhilesh Yadav. The two regional leaders have already announced their support for AAP in the Delhi elections making it a lonely battle for the grand-old-party. The only relief perhaps for the Congress is that none of these parties have much presence in the national capital.This is not the first time that AAP and Congress are facing off in Delhi. In the last two assembly elections also the Congress was AAP's rival but could not make any impact and even failed to open its account. But this time around the Congress seems to be gunning for Kejriwal like never before. With the AAP battling 10 years of anti-incumbency, will the Congress manage to dent the fortunes of the ruling party?",The verbal duel between friends-turned-rivals sharpened on Tuesday as Rahul Gandhi continued with his relentless attacks on the AAP government.

"In a first, SC collegium meets judge aspirants outside Delhi",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-a-first-sc-collegium-meets-judge-aspirants-outside-delhi/articleshow/117246374.cms,"NEW DELHI: For the first time in nearly three decades of its existence, the Supreme Court collegium met with candidates recommended for judgeship by the collegiums of the Andhra Pradesh and Telangana high courts last weekend in Visakhapatnam to assess their personality, suitability, and competence for constitutional court judgeship.Since the creation of the collegium system by two judgments of the SC in the 1990s for selection of constitutional court judges and insulate judiciary from influence of the executive, this is the first time the SC collegium, led by CJI Sanjiv Khanna and comprising Justices B R Gavai and Surya Kant, carried out a part of the judge election process outside Delhi.More than 20 of the 32 SC judges went with their families for a retreat at Visakhapatnam, a busy east-coast city in Andhra Pradesh. With the Andhra Pradesh and Telangana HCs recommending candidates each for HC judgeship, the collegium decided that instead of calling the candidates to Delhi for interaction, it would be better to assess them at Visakhapatnam which will save the candidates both time and money.The interaction with three candidates from Andhra Pradesh and five from Telangana took place in the hotel where the SC judges were lodged for retreat. The collegium had kicked in the novelty of personal interaction with candidates on Dec 22 when it assessed the suitability, capability and personality of candidates recommended for judgeship in the Allahabad, Bombay and Rajasthan HCs.Earlier, the SC collegium solely went by the detailed biodata of the lawyers and judicial officers submitted by HC collegiums as well as the intelligence reports about their antecedents and opinions of the concerned governors and chief ministers. The personal interaction with the recommended candidates helped in judging first-hand their demeanour and suitability for appointment as judges, sources said.The collegium is at present debating on two significant proposals to weed out the 'father-uncle judge' influence in the selection of judges to HCs. Given the widespread discontent among lawyers that first generation lawyers seldom get considered for HC judgeship when pitted against sitting or former constitutional court judges' lawyer children, the initial proposal was rather radical - pause selecting kith and kin of sitting and former judges' children as HC judges.Though many lawyers welcomed the proposal, some felt it would be discriminatory to bar appointment of competent lawyers as HC judges solely because they are children of sitting or former judges. The second proposal took a middle path and said the assessment benchmark for kith and kin of sitting or former judges' lawyer children should be kept higher compared to that for first generation lawyers.","For the first time in nearly three decades of its existence, the Supreme Court collegium met with candidates recommended for judgeship.

Heavy-duty military drone of Israeli-origin crashes into the sea off Porbandar,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/heavy-duty-military-drone-of-israeli-origin-crashes-into-the-sea-off-porbandar/articleshow/117242099.cms,"NEW DELHI: A heavy-duty drone or remotely-piloted aircraft, assembled in India by Adani Defence and Aerospace under license from Israel, crashed into the sea during pre-acceptance trials off Porbandar in Gujarat on Monday.The medium-altitude, long endurance (MALE) drone called Drishti-10 by the Adani group, based on the Hermes 900 Starliner of Israeli firm Elbit Systems, was being operated by the vendor from the Porbandar naval air enclave when it ditched into the sea.“The vendor has retrieved the drone and will analyse what went wrong. It has no financial implications for the Navy since the drone was yet to be delivered,” an official said.The Army and Navy in 2023 ordered two each of these satcom-enabled drones, which are touted to be capable of operating at an altitude of up to 30,000-feet with an endurance of 36 hours and a 450-kg payload, under emergency procurement provisions.Each of these drones, which are designed for long-range ISR (intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance) missions, costs around Rs 120 crore. While the first Drishti-10 was delivered to the Navy in Jan last year, the Army got the second in June. The one that crashed on Monday was earmarked for the Navy.The armed forces, which over the years have imported a large number of Israeli Searcher, Heron Mark-I and Mark-II drones for long-range surveillance and precision-targeting, require almost 150 new MALE remotely-piloted aircraft systems.India in October last year had inked the Rs 32,350 crore contract with the US for 31 armed MQ-9B `Predators’, which are high-altitude, long endurance (HALE) drones. Under it, 15 MQ-9B Sea Guardians are earmarked for the Navy, while the Army and IAF will get eight Sky Guardians each, all armed with Hellfire missiles, GBU-39B precision-guided glide bombs and other weapons.","The medium-altitude, long endurance (MALE) drone called Drishti-10 by the Adani group, based on the Hermes 900 Starliner of Israeli firm Elbit Systems.

"At Maha Kumbh, high-tech solutions for a swachh celebration",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/at-maha-kumbh-high-tech-solutions-for-a-swachh-celebration/articleshow/117246576.cms,"As the sun rises over the sprawling expanse of the Maha Kumbh Mela , the sheer magnitude of the event comes into focus. Imagine a sea of humanity, each individual contributing to the vibrant mosaic of faith and devotion. In this awe-inspiring spectacle, the silent heroes are the advanced waste management technologies working tirelessly behind the scenes. Like unsung conductors of a grand symphony, these innovations ensure that every note of cleanliness and hygiene is perfectly in tune.From high-tech sewage treatment plants to natural purification ponds, each element plays a crucial role in maintaining the sanctity of the environment. This harmonious blend of tradition and technology not only preserves the spiritual essence of the Maha Kumbh but also sets a benchmark for future large-scale gatherings worldwide.Imagine a bustling city that springs up overnight, teeming with millions converging for a grand spiritual gathering. A 45-day religious event that attracts an estimated 40 crore visitors. The logistical challenge of managing the waste generated each day is staggering. The authorities, however, are not daunted. They have enlisted the help of Indian Space Research Organisation and Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC), two of India's premier scientific institutions, to tackle this Herculean task.The scale of waste generation at the Maha Kumbh is mind-boggling: nearly 16 million litres of faecal sludge and 240 million litres of greywater every day, and massive solid waste from millions of pilgrims. Managing this requires sophisticated solutions, and that's where advanced technologies come into play.One of these is the Hybrid Granular Sequencing Batch Reactor (hgSBR), developed through an Isro-BARC collaboration. Imagine a high-tech washing machine, but instead of cleaning clothes, it treats sewage. This technology will be used at three prefabricated Faecal Sludge Treatment Plants (FSTPs), efficiently processing human waste and ensuring that the environment remains clean and safe.Another innovative technique is Geotube Technology . Think of it as a giant tea bag which holds and treats large volumes of liquid waste. This technology helps in the containment and treatment of waste, ensuring that only clean water is released back in the environment.Bioremediation is another fascinating approach being used at the Maha Kumbh. Picture a series of large ponds, each teeming with beneficial microorganisms that break down pollutants and cleanse the water. This natural and environment-friendly method will be applied to greywater collected in approximately 75 large ponds, ensuring the water is treated effectively and safely.The Uttar Pradesh govt has shown significant commitment to waste management, with a total Maha Kumbh budget of Rs 7,000 crore. Rs 1,600 crore is dedicated to waste and water management, and Rs 316 crore is specifically allocated for open defecation free (ODF) infrastructure. This financial and infrastructural commitment underscores the importance of maintaining hygiene and sanitation during the event.The technologies being deployed aim to mitigate several critical environmental concerns. They prevent river water contamination, reduce potential health risks from waste and sewage, and minimise the ecological footprint of the massive gathering. The operational strategy for waste management includes reducing manual handling to a minimum, emphasising source-level waste segregation using advanced technological interventions, and implementing strategic disposal mechanisms.Additional preparatory measures include the installation of 1.45 lakh portable toilets, the deployment of a number of sweepers for continuous cleaning, the establishment of sufficient medical facilities, and a comprehensive waste collection and management infrastructure.These advanced technologies represent a paradigm shift in managing large-scale religious gatherings. They offer environmentally sustainable waste management, reduced health risks, minimal ecological disruption, and efficient resource utilisation. Maha Kumbh 2025 stands as a testament to India's technological prowess in managing complex logistical and environmental challenges associated with massive religious congregations.

’ to make India ‘climate-smart’ nation

NEW DELHI: India's meteorological advancement has not only built the country's disaster management capacity but also benefited the world with India always standing up to help nations hit by natural calamities, including those in its neighbourhood, PM Narendra Modi said on Tuesday.Indicating how it further expanded the country's soft power and ""enhanced its image globally as a 'Vishwa Vandhu'"", PM Modi, while addressing the 150th foundation day celebration of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) here, said this is not 150 years of journey of only the Met department, but also a ""glorious journey of India's modern science and technology"".Citing the country's 'flash flood guidance system', he noted that it helps neighbouring nations such as Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka by sharing information, and commended IMD scientists for their significant contributions to these achievements.Referring to the substantial progress made in the weather information dissemination system in the past decade, Modi pointed out that only 10% of farmers and livestock owners used weather-related advice 10 years ago, but this number has now increased to over 50%.The PM on the occasion launched 'Mission Mausam' with the goal of making the country a 'weather-ready, climate-smart' nation, and released the ' IMD Vision 2047 ' document that spells out the next 22 years journey of the Met department for making India a global leader in weather forecast system, climate modelling and export of meteorological instruments.'Mission Mausam' aims at achieving the goal by deploying cutting-edge weather surveillance technologies and systems, implementing high-resolution atmospheric observations, next-generation radars and satellites, and high-performance computers in the coming years.Encouraging scientists, research scholars and institutions like IMD to work towards new breakthroughs, Modi highlighted the need to work with future requirements in mind, including developing early warning systems for natural disasters like earthquakes.Underlining India's rich history of meteorological expertise, the PM pointed out that the country's traditional knowledge was well documented, refined and deeply studied in ancient texts like the Vedas, Samhitas, and Surya Siddhanta, and called for greater exploration and integration of this knowledge with contemporary scientific practices.""There is a need to research more in this direction and explore how to link substantiated (traditional) knowledge with modern science,"" said Modi after citing numerous examples of ancient texts carrying information on meteorology.He also referred to how significant works such as 'Krishi Parashar' and 'Brihat Samhita' studied cloud formation and types, and the mathematical work on planetary positions at the time where there were no scientific instruments available to study those phenomena.Lauding the IMD's efforts towards accuracy of its forecast, the PM spoke how his visit to Sonamarg in J&K to inaugurate a 6.5-km tunnel on Monday was planned on the basis of the Met department's advance prediction of a clear weather day in the snow-clad region.Established on Jan 15 in 1875, IMD has been at the forefront of providing critical weather and climate services, playing a vital role in disaster management, agriculture, aviation, and public safety. Its overall forecast accuracy witnessed a 40% improvement in 2023 as compared to 2014.Addressing the gathering, Union minister of earth sciences Jitendra Singh pointed to the rise in the accuracy of weather forecasts in the last 10 years.","PM Narendra Modi: India's meteorological advancement has built the country's disaster management capacity.

For Pakistan, PoK is nothing more than foreign territory."" The neighbouring country was using PoK territory to sponsor terrorism in India, running training camps and launch pads for terrorists there, he said.Pakistan had been promoting illegal infiltration and terrorism since 1965, and continued to do so, despite the people of J&K consistently refusing to support its nefarious designs, Rajnath said, appreciating the sacrifices made by the Muslim community in the fight against terrorism. Rajnath highlighted how individuals like Mohammed Usman had laid down their lives to protect India's sovereignty.The situation on ground had significantly improved since the abrogation of Article 370, he asserted, and faulted Congress for its failure to do this earlier, although he did not name any individual.

The invitation has also given rise to speculation about Pawar's political strategy as his party faces challenges after a poor showing in the last year Maharashtra polls.Modi has been invited for the Akhil Bharatiya Marathi Sahitya Sammelan , the organising committee of which is headed by Pawar. The event is held under the banner of the Akhil Bharatiya Marathi Sahitya Mahamandal.In his invitation to the Prime Minister, Pawar said this is the first time that the sammelan is being held in Delhi (from Feb 21-23) and recalled that the event's 37th edition was inaugurated by former PM Jawaharlal Nehru.Pawar highlighted the historical significance of the sammelan, dating back to 1878 when it was first held as the 'Granthakar Sammelan' by Justice Mahadev Govind Ranade in Pune. The event has seen participation of prominent figures like Lokmanya Tilak, Namdar Gokhale, V D Savarkar and Kakasaheb Gadgil.His letter to Modi emphasised the appropriateness of the PM inaugurating the event, given the recent recognition of Marathi as a classical language. ""Recently, during your tenure, the historical decision to accord Marathi language the status of classical language was taken. On this backdrop, it would be apt that this year, this impressive confluence of Marathi language and culture is inaugurated at your hands,"" Pawar wrote.NCP-SP ally Shiv Sena (UBT), however, offered a critical perspective, emphasising that classical language status resulted from collective efforts.

It is due to collective contribution and not because of a single party or any leader,"" Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut said.Last year, after the Centre's granted Marathi classical language status, Pawar had said , ""Five languages have been given the status of elite languages, and Marathi is one of them. This is very important for the Marathi language and other languages which have got the status of elite language. This decision has been taken a little late but the important thing is that this decision has been taken.

PM Modi inaugurates Z-Morh tunnel in J&K: All you need to know about the project,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-modi-inaugurates-z-morh-tunnel-in-jk-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-project/articleshow/117191512.cms,"What we know about tunnel so far:

The Z-Morh tunnel, built at a cost of Rs 2,400 crore along the Srinagar-Leh National Highway, represents a significant advancement in providing year-round road access to the Ladakh region. The construction commenced in May 2015 and reached completion in the previous year. The tunnel's initial opening took place in February 2024.

This infrastructure holds strategic importance for national defence requirements in Ladakh whilst establishing reliable connectivity between the Union Territory and the rest of India.

Located at 8,650 feet elevation, this two-lane tunnel features an additional 7.5-metre-wide emergency escape passage running parallel to the main structure.

The tunnel facilitates uninterrupted travel between Gagangir and Sonamarg, particularly benefiting summer travel to Ladakh.

This 2-lane road tunnel is being built under the mountain glacier Thajiwas Glacier between Gagangir and Sonamarg in Ganderbal district of Kashmir ensuring all-weather connectivity to Sonamarg boosting tourism. The strategic location of the Sonamarg tunnel will help in bypassing the major avalanche zones of NH-1 in the hung area which will ensure the safety of commuters.

This project features a third lane on the approach road to optimize traffic management by enabling the seamless movement of slow-moving vehicles while allowing faster-moving traffic to bypass without obstruction, thereby mitigating congestion and preventing traffic bottlenecks previously caused by heavy or slow-moving vehicles.

Working in conjunction with the Zojila tunnel currently under construction, this infrastructure will provide continuous access for both civilian and military vehicles to the Baltal and Ladakh areas.

The National Highways and Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited (NHIDCL), overseeing the project, confirmed the tunnel's advanced technological features providing continuous updates and connectivity. This modern infrastructure aims to enhance travel efficiency and establish improved road connectivity standards.

Together with the Zojila Tunnel, scheduled for completion by 2028, the project will decrease the route distance from 49 km to 43 km and increase vehicle speeds from 30 km/hr to 70 km/hr, ensuring continuous NH-1 connectivity between Srinagar and Ladakh. Officials indicate this improved access will strengthen defence logistics and promote economic and socio-cultural development across Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday inaugurated the 6.5 km long Z-Morh tunnel in Ganderbal district of Jammu and Kashmir that will make the Sonamarg tourist resort accessible throughout the year.Along with the PM, Union surface transport minister Nitin Gadkari, Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha and chief minister Omar Abdullah was also present there at the event.Earlier today, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) IT cell chief Amit Malaviya shared a video on X and said that the Modi government is empowering Jammu & Kashmir.","The Z-Morh tunnel, built at a cost of Rs 2,400 crore along the Srinagar-Leh National Highway, represents a significant advancement in providing year-round road access to the Ladakh region.

These are an advanced version of the Kolkata-class (Project-15A) destroyers, featuring substantial improvements in design, automation and ordnance.Nilgiri is the lead ship of Project-17A, which is a series of stealth guided-missile frigates being built for the Indian Navy. It has enhanced stealth features (reduced radar signatures) and state-of-the-art technology compared to the current Shivalik-class frigates. Designed by the Indian Navy’s Warship Design Bureau, New Delhi, Nilgiri is enabled to operate independently without supporting vessels, and also to function as the flagship of the naval task force.The sixth Scorpene-class submarine under the Kalvari-class Project 75, Vaghsheer is one of the most silent and versatile diesel-electric submarines in the world. It is designed to undertake a wide range of missions, including anti-surface warfare, anti-submarine warfare, intelligence gathering, area surveillance and special operations.It features, among others, a modular construction, allowing for future upgrades such as the integration of Air Independent Propulsion (AIP) technology.

BMI by itself isn't an accurate tool to diagnose obesity: Study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bmi-by-itself-isnt-an-accurate-tool-to-diagnose-obesity-study/articleshow/117247082.cms,"NEW DELHI: For years, doctors have relied on Body Mass Index (BMI) calculations to assess obesity. However, a global commission convened by The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology, a reputed medical journal, now argues that BMI provides inaccurate results.It has suggested doctors should confirm whether a person has obesity or not by at least one other body measurement, for example, waist circumference , or by measuring body fat directly.BMI is a medical screening tool that measures the ratio of a person's height to her or his weight to estimate the amount of body fat she or he has.Current definition says a person with a BMI of 30 kg/m2 and above can be considered obese.According to the Lancet Commission's report, which was released Tuesday, people with excess body fat do not always have a BMI above 30, meaning that their health risk can go unnoticed.Similarly, it says, individuals with high muscle mass (eg. Athletes) tend to have high BMIs despite normal fat mass and diagnosing them as having obesity or a disease was inappropriate.""Relying on BMI alone to diagnose obesity is problematic as some people tend to store excess fat at the waist or in and around their organs, such as the liver, the heart or the muscles, and this is associated with a higher health risk compared to when excess fat is stored just beneath the skin in the arms, legs or in other body areas. But people with excess body fat do not always have a BMI that indicates they are living with obesity, meaning their health problems can go unnoticed. Additionally, some people have a high BMI and high body fat but maintain normal organ and body functions, with no signs or symptoms of ongoing illness."" Robert Eckel, a professor at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus (USA), who was part of the expert group, said.Dr Anoop Misra, a doctor from India who was in the expert committee, added: ""Abdominal obesity is very common in India. The existing criteria based on BMI measurement often fails to classify them as obesity. The new classification will help remove this hurdle.""The Lancet Commission says not all persons having obesity need medical or surgical intervention. It has, for the first time, recommended sub-dividing obesity into two groups: clinical obesity and pre-clinical obesity , based on the presence or absence, respectively, of objective clinical manifestations (ie, signs and symptoms) of altered organ function or impairment of an individual's ability to conduct daily activities.Persons with preclinical obesity, the Commission suggests, does not generally require treatment with drugs or surgery, and might need only monitoring of health over time and health counselling if the individual's risk of progression to clinical obesity or other diseases is deemed sufficiently low.However, it adds, those having clinical obesity may require medical or surgical intervention as obesity, if left untreated, can lead to serious complications including an increased risk of heart attack and stroke.","BMI is a medical screening tool that measures the ratio of a person's height to her or his weight.

""From free food for 800 million, 2.2 billion free vaccines, and aid to nations worldwide during Covid, to leading India as the fastest-growing major economy, PM Modi's decisive third-term victory is a testament to good governance and public trust,"" he further added.Appearing on the Joe Rogan podcast, Zuckerberg said 2024 was the big election year around the world and in a lot of countries like India, the incumbents lost the polls.""There is some sort of global phenomena, whether it was inflation because of the economic policies to deal with Covid or just how the govts dealt with Covid, seems to have this effect that is global, not just the US, but like a very broad decrease in trust, at least in the set incumbents and maybe, in sort of these democratic institutions overall,"" he said.In the 2024 election, BJP lost its majority but the alliance led by the party won a comfortable majority, paving the way for Narendra Modi's third straight term.Dubey further said Zuckerberg's statement was alarming and an interference in India's democracy.","BJP MP Dubey accused Zuckerberg of spreading misinformation through his comments. Zuckerberg said 2024 was the big election year around the world and in a lot of countries like India, the incumbents lost the polls.

Jobs' wife, Laurene Powell, is currently in India attending the Maha Kumbh Mela 2025 in Prayagraj.The letter, written on Jobs' 19th birthday, February 23, 1974, was addressed to his childhood friend Tim Brown.

I will be leaving sometime in March, not really certain yet.""The letter provides a rare glimpse into Jobs' spiritual side, heavily influenced by Hinduism, as he signs off with ""Shanti, Steve Jobs.""

: The mystery illness plaguing residents of Badhaal village in Kotranka area of J&K’s Rajouri district claimed two more lives in the past 24 hours — that of a six-year-old girl and her 62-year-old relative — taking the death toll to 14 since Dec last year, including four siblings since Sunday alone.The child, Safina Kousar, died at Jammu’s SMGS hospital Tuesday, hours after her father’s maternal uncle, Mohd Yusuf, succumbed at GMC Rajouri around 9.40pm Monday. Authorities, meanwhile, were yet to obtain FSL reports of even those who died in Dec. While locals have been left terrified, strangely, only Safina’s family and their relatives living in Badhaal have so far been affected, not other residents, officials said.On Sunday, Safina and five of her siblings were admitted to GMC Rajouri with symptoms of fever, sweating, vomiting, and dehydration after consuming sweet rice at a ‘fatiha’ function organised by their grandfather. The siblings were shifted to Jammu’s SMGS hospital after their condition deteriorated. Naveena Kousar (5) died around 1.45pm Sunday, followed by her brother Zahoor Ahmed (14) at 4.30pm the same day. The third sibling, Mohd Maroof (8), succumbed around 9.25am Monday while Safina (6) breathed her last Tuesday.Earlier in Dec, nine members of two families had succumbed to similar symptoms. These families were related to Safina’s family.Officials said two more teams of experts from National Centre for Disease Control, New Delhi, and Institute of Epidemiology, Chennai, would be visiting Badhaal to probe the mystery illness. The teams would assess the situation and find the cause behind the deaths.“Rajouri deputy commissioner Abhishek Sharma is personally monitoring the situation to ensure timely intervention and mitigation. Food and water samples have already been collected from the village to ascertain the quality and safety of essential supplies in the region. As many as 272 samples were collected on Monday to identify the potential health risks,” said an official statement from the district administration.A dedicated team of the health department, led by director (health) Jammu, Dr Rakesh Mangotra, and accompanied by Rajouri chief medical officer Dr Manohar Rana is camping at Kotranka to oversee the operations, the statement said, adding that a mobile medical unit and ambulance were kept on stand-by to assist in any emergency.","Safina Kousar died at Jammu’s SMGS hospital Tuesday, hours after her father's maternal uncle, Mohd Yusuf, succumbed at GMC Rajouri around 9.40pm Monday.

On Monday, road transport minister Nitin Gadkari announced the timelines for over a dozen major projects, including highways, tunnels and ropeways, worth around Rs 1 lakh crore.Addressing a public gathering at Sonamarg, Modi said J&K is becoming a hub of tunnels, high-bridges and ropeways, with some of the world's highest tunnels and rail-road bridges being constructed in the UT. He said the Chenab Bridge is an engineering marvel and the trial run of a passenger train was recently conducted.On major connectivity projects, the PM said ropeway projects for Shankaracharya temple, Shivkhori and Baltal-Amarnath will be taken up. He added that projects with a cumulative cost of more than Rs 42,000 crore are underway in J&K, including four national highways and two ring roads. More than 14 tunnels are being constructed, making the UT ""one of the most connected regions in the country"", Modi said.In his address, Gadkari said India will become more prosperous only when there is further improvement in infrastructure. ""Industries, tourism and business can flourish only when we improve water, power, transport and communication. Our govt has put a huge focus on infrastructure development to push growth and generate employment,"" he said.On the under-construction 14-km-long Zojila tunnel , Gadkari said this would reduce the travel time from Srinagar to Leh by around three and a half hours, and there will be all- season connectivity between the two cities.

PRAYAGRAJ: More than 1.7 crore devotees immersed themselves in the bone-chilling waters of Sangam as Maha Kumbh 2025 began Monday with the sacred bath on Paush Purnima , turning the frigid confluence of Ganga, Yamuna, and the mystical Saraswati in Prayagraj into a sanctuary of warmth, spirituality and cultural heritage.Amid chants, meditation, and prayers, the spiritual fervour was palpable. Rose petals rained down on pilgrims from helicopters, enhancing the divine atmosphere as many continued towards the Triveni Sangam for their holy bath even after sundown.PM Narendra Modi lauded Maha Kumbh as the breathing example of India’s spiritual legacy and a celebration of faith and harmony. UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath described it as a symbol of India’s cultural unity in diversity.The ceremonial bath, which marked the 45-day event’s formal beginning, started at dawn and continued until dusk, with chants of “Har Har Gange” filling the air.With the temperatures plummeting to 10° Celsius, the foggy morning did not deter the faithful. They marched in unending queues to the 10,000-acre mela area, driven by devotion and the unique alignment of Paush Purnima followed by Makar Sankranti — a rarity that has amplified the huge influx of pilgrims.Though Kumbh Mela is a duodecennial event, this year’s is considered particularly auspicious as it aligns with a celestial event that occurs only once every 144 years. Over 85 lakh had already taken the holy dip in the days leading up to Monday.A larger crowd is expected on Makar Sankranti (Tuesday), when the Amrit Snan of akharas will take place.Security was tight, with 50,000 personnel ensuring safety as devotees flowed to the 41 ghats spread over 12km. ADG (Prayagraj) Bhanu Bhaskar said: “The first snan of Paush Purnima passed off peacefully.” Pilgrims from Bihar, Haryana, West Bengal, Odisha, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, and many other states joined the throng, their spirits unshaken by the cold.At the riverbank, scenes of deep faith unfolded — a couple stood waist-deep in water, fingers entwined, while a woman offered water to the rising sun. Nearby, an ascetic stood immersed in the river, eyes closed in reverence, as children played around him. The event brought together spiritual seekers and religious leaders.International visitors added to the diversity. South Korean YouTubers captured the vibrant spectacle, while Japanese tourists explored its spiritual essence with guides. Devotees from Europe, Russia, and America also participated, enthralled by the festival’s unity and faith.The Kalpvasis, known for their austere spiritual discipline, began their 30-day retreat on Paush Purnima. Their vows and prayers aimed at personal spiritual growth and the welfare of humanity added a profound dimension to Maha Kumbh’s sanctity.","More than 1.7 crore devotees immersed themselves in the bone-chilling waters of Sangam as Maha Kumbh 2025 began Monday.

PM's presence signal to those against

: Omar

SRINAGAR/NEW DELHI: The unusual bonhomie stood out in the numbing cold of Sonamarg. J&K CM Omar Abdullah lauded PM Narendra Modi saying he enjoyed high trust among people for keeping his word to hold free and fair elections in the state even as he urged the PM to make good his commitment to restore the Union Territory to statehood .Modi reciprocated the sentiment by terming J&K the ""crown of India"", promising a new future for the youth of the UT and reaffirming that he would fulfil his statehood promise ""at the appropriate time"". He said, ""Yeh Modi hai, wada karta hai toh nibhata hai. Har kaam ka ek samay hai, aur sahi samay pe sahi kaam bhi hone wale hain (This is Modi who keeps his promises. And right things are going to happen at the right time).""The occasion was the opening of the 6.4km all-weather Sonamarg tunnel , an engineering feat accomplished in a challenging terrain in the face of threats from Pakistan-backed terrorists who killed seven workers in Oct. The tunnel will considerably reduce travel time between Srinagar and Leh.But as the speakers spoke of shrinking distance between hearts and between Delhi and Srinagar, many could also see a shrinking gap between the two political adversaries.Omar's praise for PM Modi on Monday contrasted sharply with his recent remarks on INDIA bloc. He had said there was no INDIA meeting and hence there was no clarity about ""its leadership, agenda or existence"".Omar had said they should ""wind up the alliance"" in case it was just for the Parliament elections.Omar, who spoke first, set the tone by complimenting Modi on his interest in J&K as evidenced by his second visit in a fortnight, completion of infrastructure projects which - enabled by improved security situation - has brought in hordes of tourists. ""Remote areas such as Machil, Gurez, Karnah and Keran are seeing benefits in terms of development and tourism , with an increasing number of tourists visiting these regions,"" he said.The CM emphasised that while the foundation for Sonamarg tunnel was laid in 2012, it took Modi and Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari to complete it.Omar said that the PM's presence was a signal to those who didn't want development of the nation, and peace and democracy in J&K. ""They will always face defeat and we will send them defeated from here. We will not allow any damage to democracy, peace and development of J&K,"" the CM said in a forthright attack on terrorists and their backers in Pakistan.On elections, he stressed that there was zero interference by the administration and there was no repolling in any booth. Coming from someone who had fought elections while expressing apprehension of rigging of polls, this was a remarkable praise, the warmth of which was palpable even in minus 9 degree celsius.The applause for his appeal for statehood could not have escaped the PM's attention. He reiterated ""Modi ki guarantee"" but was firm that Centre would go by its own timetable.Modi said Kashmir's development, like of all other parts, was crucial for India's goal of becoming a developed country - remarks which appeared to go beyond the oft-stated resolve of Kashmir being an integral part of India.""Kashmir is India's crown, and the dream of Viksit Bharat can be achieved only when it is bedecked with jewels. Jammu and Kashmir of the 21st century is scripting a new chapter of development,"" he said.""The region is regaining its identity as 'Paradise on Earth', leaving behind the difficult days of the past. Today, people are going to Lal Chowk to have ice-cream and there is hustle and bustle at night. My artist friends from Kashmir have made Polo View Market the new habitat centre. In Srinagar, people go to cinema halls with their children and watch movies. No govt can do so many things that change the situation,"" Modi said, adding that a few months ago, an international marathon was held for the first time in Srinagar. He said Omar too participated in it and the video was widely circulated on social media.",J&K CM Omar Abdullah lauded PM Narendra Modi for keeping his word to hold free and fair elections in the state.

'Foolproof': What EC said on EVM tampering allegations



'Why does he want it?' EC over blocking public access of CCTV footage of poll booths



NEW DELHI: Election Commission of India on Tuesday addressed concerns regarding wrongful additions and deletions of voters in the electoral roll and said that the allegations regarding the rigging Electronic Voting Machines were ""baseless.""Setting a poetic tone, the chief election commissioner Rajiv Kumar began with a shayari: ""All questions hold importance; answers must follow; out of habit, we kept giving written replies, but today, face-to-face feels necessary; who knows if tomorrow will come or not, today, an answer is due).""The CEC, before announcing the dates of Delhi assembly elections, took the opportunity to offer clarifications on allegations, including EVM tampering , erratic changes in voter list and recent changes in rules by the poll body to prevent public inspection of certain electronic documents.Kumar refuted claims of manipulation in the electoral roll, categorically mentioning that no deletion is made without proper documentation, field verification, and providing the individual an opportunity to be heard.On addition of names to the electoral roll, Kumar said, ""Regular meetings are held with the representatives of political parties, who have the right to appoint booth-level agents (BLAs). Weekly lists of claims and objections are shared, and both draft and final rolls are published on the Election Commission's website. Polling station rationalisation is also carried out with the consultation of all the stakeholders.""Regarding deletion of names from the list, he said, ""Mandatory field verification is conducted by the BLOs, and in cases where deletions exceed 2 per cent of a polling station's voter list, cross-verification is done. Deletions due to death require a certified death certificate, and a seven-day window is provided for objections after notices are published online. Also, the affected voters are given the opportunity for a personal hearing before their names are removed.""""Where every vote matters, raising doubts about deletion of thousands of names without evidence is misleading. The processes we follow leave no room for manipulation,"" he said.He added that political parties were involved at each and every stage of voter list preparation with full disclosure and opportunity to object.CEC said that it was not possible to change the voter turnout and said that it was ""misleading to compare final VTR with 5pm data.""""...It is impossible to change voter turnout...Some polling parties report at midnight or the next day. Form 17C is matched before counting. There is nothing which VTR does not explain. It explains fully,"" he said.Addressing the EVM issue, CEC said, ""There is no evidence of unreliability or any drawback in the EVM... There is no question of introducing a virus or bug in the EVM. There is no question of invalid votes in the EVM. No rigging is possible. High courts and the Supreme Court are continuously saying this in different judgments... What else can be said? EVMs are foolproof devices for counting. Allegations of tampering are baseless. We are speaking now because we don't speak when elections are on.""Kumar also cited court rulings at multiple occasions and said that ""courts have ruled on 42 occasions that EVMs are not hackable, allegations of tampering totally baseless.""""This is aimed at derailing the electoral process,"" he added.Further, he said that no discrepancies had been found between votes counted through Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) and Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) slips,"" he said.""Let me tell the nation today. After the Supreme Court mandated in 2019 that five VVPATs must be counted from each assembly constituency, over 67,000 VVPATs have been checked. ""This translates to more than 4.5 crore (VVPAT) slips being verified. And let me assure you that not even the difference of one vote has been found with the new machines since 2019,"" he added.Kumar defended the recent amendment to election rules restricting public access to CCTV footage from polling booths, citing the need to safeguard voter privacy and prevent misuse of data to create false narratives.""Why does he want it? Let us ask this question from the person who wants it,"" Kumar asked as he addressed the reason why the poll body had decided to block public access to CCTV footages of poll booths.The CEC explained that the poll authority has evidence showing how such data could be exploited for machine learning and AI to craft deceptive narratives. He cautioned that even fact-checkers might struggle to distinguish between genuine and AI-generated videos of polling stations.The government, acting on the Election Commission's recommendation, amended the rules last month to limit public inspection of certain electronic documents, including polling station CCTV footage, to prevent potential abuse.This comes amidst the opposition raising concerns regarding irregularities in electoral processes, with AAP national convenor Arvind Kejriwal recently accusing BJP of tampering with voters' lists in Delhi. The former CM had alleged that there was an ""unusual increase"" in voter list modifications, including both removals and additions, specifically in New Delhi constituency.Congress had also raised similar concerns during Maharashtra and Haryana assembly elections, with Mallikarjun Kharge demanding ballot papers instead of EVMs.Assembly elections in Delhi are set to take place in a single phase on February 5. Votes would be counted on February 8.","The Election Commission of India addressed concerns regarding wrongful additions and deletions of voters in the electoral roll.

I always kept to myself. So I remember when we're watching at home when Eddie had passed, and the video package that they played with the Three Doors Down song, and I just remember crying as a kid watching this. Remembering him, and just what he had done with me, and just everything that like we had gone through and that angle, you know? So I remember that as a wrestling fan, because I knew I wasn't gonna see him again.""Considering Dominik Mysterio's statement regarding Eddie Guerrero, it is safe to say that his great uncle, Rey Misterio Sr .'s demise, must have been incredibly unsettling.","Rey Misterio Sr. passed away on December 20, 2024, at the age of 66.

“The next item for the Lakers on their list is a backup center. The Lakers will continue to try and acquire Wizards center Jonas Valanciunas...with their remaining future second-round draft capital, and Gabe Vincent is expected to be dangled in talks as well.”

According to insiders Joshua Robbins and David Aldridge,Jonas Valanciunas’ team-friendly contract makes him an attractive option for contenders. The Wizards center is signed through this season and the next two, with an annual salary of around $10 million—a relative bargain for a player of his caliber.

Ashwini Vaishnaw fact-checks Meta CEO

Here’s the post shared by Ashwini Vaishnaw

Zuckerberg’s claim is factually incorrect: Ashwini Vaishnaw

Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg's recent claim that most incumbent governments, including the BJP-led NDA, lost power post-Covid-19 has led India’s Parliamentary Committee to summon Meta authorities. BJP MP Nishikant Dubey announced on X (formerly Twitter) that he would send a summon to Meta and demand an apology from the platform to India’s Parliament.He shared a post on X which, roughly translated into English, says: ""My committee will call Meta for this wrong information. Wrong information in any democratic country tarnishes the image of the country. That organization will have to apologize to the Indian Parliament and the people here for this mistake.IT and Railways Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw shared his disappointment over a recent statement by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg about India's 2024 elections. During a latest episode of Joe Rogan's podcast, Zuckerberg mentioned that ""incumbents lost every single election in 2024,"" Specifically naming India. He linked this trend to a global loss of trust in governments after the Covid-19 pandemic. Zuckerberg further explained that public trust declined because of issues like inflation, pandemic-related economic policies, and how governments handled Covid-19. He believed this dissatisfaction led to incumbents losing elections worldwide.In response, union minister Vaishnaw took to microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter) to clarify the situation, specifically regarding India’s elections. He wrote “As the world’s largest democracy, India conducted the 2024 elections with over 640 million voters. People of India reaffirmed their trust in NDA led by PM @narendramodi Ji’s leadership.”He further added “Mr. Zuckerberg’s claim that most incumbent governments, including India in 2024 elections, lost post-COVID is factually incorrect. From free food for 800 million, 2.2 billion free vaccines, and aid to nations worldwide during COVID, to leading India as the fastest-growing major economy, PM Modi’s decisive 3rd-term victory is a testament to good governance and public trust.”Tagging Meta in the post, Vaishnaw stated “it’s disappointing to see misinformation from Mr. Zuckerberg himself. Let’s uphold facts and credibility.”","IT and Railways Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw shared his disappointment over a recent statement by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg about India's 2024 elections.
