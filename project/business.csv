A mom for the mothers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/a-mom-for-the-mothers/articleshow/114799238.cms,"The call came at 1am. Dr Aparna Hegde rushed to the emergency room. She will never forget what she saw: “A beautiful, frail young woman with the head of a dead baby sticking out of her”.Aruna, 25, had just about made it to Sion Hospital in the heart of Mumbai for her first delivery after a journey of 30km from a hospital on the city outskirts. Undiagnosed gestational diabetes meant her baby’s body was too large to come out. Three days after that harrowing Friday night of 1996, when Hegde — then a resident doctor — found herself using a needle and twine to join the infant’s body back with its head, Aruna passed away.“Not only did she die a horrible death, it was preventable,” says Hegde. Aruna was not told about the danger signs and potential complications from gestational diabetes during her first visit to the gynaecologist. She wasn’t told to follow up with regular check-ups either. “If only she had been...” Hegde trails off. That unfinished thought birthed an NGO in 2008.In a country where an Aruna dies every 20 minutes, ARMMAN (Advancing Reduction In Mortality And Morbidity Of Mothers, Children And Neonates) has been working to ensure pregnant women and mothers seek timely healthcare, and health workers are equipped to provide quality services through timely voice calls and video messaging services.“Information is empowerment,” says Hegde. “Lack of access to information is the biggest reason for maternal and child mortality in India.” Her 16-year-old NGO now boasts nearly 4 lakh frontline workers across 21 states who have reached more than 5.2 crore women and their children. “The goal is to reach 7 crore women and their children and train 8.5 lakh health workers by 2030,” says the Stanford alumnus.While a recent UN report says India’s share of global maternal deaths has dropped from 26% in 1990 to 8% in 2020 — a positive fall attributed to women increasingly opting to go to the hospital for delivery — Hegde says it’s not enough.“In the next one hour, three women will die while giving birth. For every woman who dies, 20 more suffer debilitating morbidity. Two children below five years die every minute. Thirty per cent of children under five are malnourished and 35.5% are stunted. These are not just physical problems, but sociocultural phenomena rooted in gender discrimination,” says the urogynaecologist. While the focus on hospital deliveries has cut down deaths, Hegde says lack of awareness and access to primary maternity care, and lack of training among health workers, leads to systemic deficiencies.“The experience of antenatal (pre-birth) care in a govt hospital can be very apathetic in urban India,” says Hegde. “In rural India, ASHA workers don’t get an incentive for counselling. They can’t visit homes more than once a month. So, you can’t counsel mothers-to-be when required. Also, since the primary care system does not work very well, you would have women whose cases can be managed by level-two hospitals getting sent to a tertiary hospital, leading to overcrowding.”Hegde chanced upon the solution in a village in mid2000s Karnataka where she spotted an affirming sight: a villager using a cellphone to tell her employer that she would be late to work.ARMMAN’s free mobile voice call service, mMitra, was born. It sends targeted preventive care information twice a week to the enrolled women throughout pregnancy and infancy in their chosen language and time. The alerts continue till the child is a year old. And it pays attention to the details as well. For example, while mothers-to-be are told about the importance of taking iron pills in the second month of pregnancy to tackle anaemia, it also advises them on how to take these pills. “Avoid coffee after taking the pill as it reduces the absorption of iron,” warns the voice. Two weeks later, women are also told how to tackle the adverse effects of iron pills. “Women loved it,” recalls Hegde.Mumbai-based Sonia Gawde received a call from mMitra when she was seven months pregnant with her second child. “Your baby should be kicking by now,” the voice said in Marathi. She felt nothing. Gawde approached her doctor and learned that her foetus had died in the womb. Gawde soon became a ‘sakhi’, a trained community health worker, to enrol women directly in the early stages of pregnancy, at mMitra. She has had a healthy boy since. mMitra’s success would lead to the Union ministry of health and family welfare tying up with ARMMAN for the implementation of a similar mobilebased maternal messaging programme by the govt, called Kilkari, expanding the NGO’s reach. “Kilkari motivated me to become a health worker,” 25-year-old Chhattisgarh-based Puja Verma told ARMMAN’s team recently.After listening to the calls all through her pregnancy, when this new mother from Raipur district applied to become a frontline health worker, her familiarity with maternal and child health made an impression on the village selection committee. “One aspect I really like about Kilkari is that it focuses on the health and recovery of the mother, too, post-childbirth,” says Sabita Maliful from Odisha’s Nabarangpur district. Mother of a six month-old, Sabita says the calls have guided her on breastfeeding, immunisation, and nutrition after delivery. “Even my husband started listening to the calls,” says Sabita.“It took me five years to get the first rupee into ARMMAN. I knocked on hundreds of doors. At that point, there was no CSR and the idea of using tech for medical care was alien. Now, of course, post-Covid, it (virtual medical care) seems so obvious, right?” laughs Hedge. “The most underprivileged women want to know when their child will be able to tell colour, when their child will develop fingers in their womb and so on.Armed with information, women are upending patriarchal family dynamics, challenging entrenched mores, and demanding care.” In Assam, which has India’s highest maternal mortality rate, ASHA worker Lacky Rani is discussing issues like family planning and open defecation with new mothers. “Most women need help in these areas,” says Rani, who attributes her newfound confidence on such uneasy subjects to Dr Anita, a voice on Mobile Academy, a mobile-based govt audio service implemented by ARMMAN.“The glaring absence of comprehensive guidelines for the management of high-risk pregnancies means that health workers remain largely unaware of when and how to refer women to higher centres for treatment, what counselling to give, and what they need to do when a pregnant woman is referred back from a higher centre,” says Hegde.Of the 35 “evidence-based guidelines for management of high-risk conditions” prescribed by ARMMAN as part of its programme to train auxiliary nurse midwives (ANMs), medical officers, and specialist doctors in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, many have recently been drafted into govt policy by the two states.“With the vast geographical, social, and cultural diversity in India, the interventions have to break the barriers of socio-cultural-politico-economic norms and address existing inequities in society to enhance the decision-making powers for women when it comes to their health,” says Hegde, adding that ARMMAN is now looking to harness AI and predictive analytics to understand the reasons for low listenership and dropouts, and set aside funds to retain them. “We are now focusing on both husband and wife,” says Hegde.(Know about any such inspiring story?

Silver outshines gold for first time in festive season,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/silver-outshines-gold-for-first-time-in-festive-season/articleshow/114795481.cms,"HYDERABAD/MUMBAI: For the first time in the history of the Indian jewellery market , silver glittered more than gold this Dhanteras . As gold prices continued their record-breaking run, it dampened consumer demand. Shoppers instead rushed to buy silver."" Silver sales have shot up 30-35% this year despite prices being 40% higher than last Dhanteras,"" Surendra Mehta, national secretary at Indian Bullion & Jewellers Association (IBJA), said. ""We are collating data for silver because this is the first time we are seeing such a huge demand,"" Mehta told TOI.For one, the high price of gold dissuaded many buyers and prompted them to look at silver instead. In addition to the demand for silver jewellery, the expected high industrial demand for the white metal - mainly from booming EV manufacturers - is making it the most sought-after precious metal now. ""People have now begun to understand that there is a real opportunity in investing in silver,"" Mehta added.While demand for silver during Dhanteras this year surged 30-35%, sales of gold were 15% lower at around 35-36 tonne as compared to 42 tonne last festive season. However, thanks to about a 30% rise in average price of the yellow metal, sales (in value terms) were higher at nearly Rs 28,000 crore from about Rs 24,000-25,000 crore last year.The World Gold Council too has projected that India's gold demand could hit a four-year low in 2024 due to the unprecedented record-breaking rally in prices. In Wednesday's mid-session, gold prices on NYMEX went above the $2,800-per-ounce mark for the first time in history on the back of global uncertainties relating to geopolitical issues, the US election, as well as continuing demand from central banks and the solar energy industry.Gold demand in India - the world's secon-biggest consumer of the precious metal - could stand between 700 tonne and 750 tonne in 2024, the lowest since 2020 and down from last year's 761 tonne, Sachin Jain, regional CEO (India) at WGC, was quoted as saying by Reuters.In the local market and commodities exchange, gold price was hovering above the Rs 80,000 per 10 gram level, while silver prices stayed above the Rs 1 lakh per kg mark.Saumil Gandhi, senior analyst (commodities) at HDFC Securities, said that gold's record on Wednesday came after the US treasury yields and the dollar fell following mixed US macro data.",Silver sales have shot up 30-35% this year despite prices being 40% higher than last Dhanteras.

This is the highest stock with the Food Corporation of India ( FCI ) in the last two decades, as per records available on its website.Officials said the huge stock is an issue and liquidating this stockpile is a challenge even as the govt allowed states to take extra rice directly from the FCI for their own schemes and sale of 23 lakh tonnes of the grain to ethanol distilleries.According to available data, the FCI had a stockpile of 299 lakh tonnes of rice and another 13 lakh tonnes receivable from millers. As per govt's buffer norms, the agency needs to keep 102.5 lakh tonnes as stock to meet the food security scheme and other welfare programmes of govt as on Oct 1.The rice stock has increased due to higher procurement by govt agencies. Moreover, the Centre had stopped the sale of rice to states from the central pool last year and banned the export of non-basmati white rice, besides imposing duty on the outbound shipment of white and parboiled rice to address food inflation and deficient rainfall.Only in the past three months, govt took several decisions, including allowing states to buy rice from FCI, allowing export of non-basmati white rice and removal of export duty on parboiled rice.Meanwhile, the food ministry has said paddy procurement was under way in full swing in Punjab and Haryana, the two major food bowls of the country, and like every year 185 lakh and 60 lakh tonnes of paddy would likely be procured from the states, during the current kharif marketing season.",Rice stock with govt is set to touch around 300 lakh tonnes on November 1.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi hailed the inauguration of the C-295 aircraft manufacturing complex in Vadodara as a transformative milestone for India’s defence and aerospace sectors. The facility, developed through a collaboration between Tata Advanced Systems Limited (TASL) and Airbus , represents the first private sector final assembly line for military aircraft in India.During the inauguratio on Monday, which was attended by Spanish President Pedro Sanchez, PM Modi emphasized the rapid progress of the project. In a LinkedIn post on Wednesday, he remarked, “The speed of execution is breathtaking— from foundation stone to operational facility in just two years! This is a clear manifestation of a new work culture and the capabilities of the people of India.”PM Modi provided a snapshot of the booming defence industry, highlighting that defence production surged to Rs 1.27 lakh crore in 2023-24, and exports rose dramatically from Rs 1,000 crore in 2014 to Rs 21,000 crore this year. He noted the indigenization of over 12,300 items within three years and mentioned an investment of over Rs 7,500 crore in domestic vendors by Defence Public Sector Undertakings.The Prime Minister outlined the comprehensive transformation of India's defence ecosystem, saying, “Our complete defence ecosystem is being transformed with indigenous warships patrolling our waters, made-in-India missiles strengthening our deterrence, and domestically produced bulletproof jackets protecting our soldiers.” He reiterated India's commitment to becoming self-reliant in defence while striving to emerge as a leading manufacturer of defence equipment on the global stage.PM Modi attributed this progress to the skills of the ""Yuva Shakti"" (youth power) and the initiatives of his government, which have contributed to reduced import dependency, job creation in the defence manufacturing sector, and skill development for the youth. He encouraged startups, manufacturers, and innovators to seize opportunities in India’s defence sector, stating, “This is your moment to be part of history. India needs your expertise and enthusiasm. The doors are open for innovation, the policies are supportive, and the opportunity is unprecedented.”In closing, he urged collective efforts to fortify India’s position as a self-reliant nation, declaring, “Together, let's build a stronger, self-reliant Bharat!”","PM Modi hailed the inauguration of the C-295 aircraft manufacturing complex in Vadodara as a transformative milestone for India’s defence and aerospace sectors.

NEW DELHI: Canadian officials reportedly accepted leaking information about Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar 's killing to The Washington Post . This information was not shared with the Canadian public, as reported by The Globe and Mail. Trudeau 's national security and intelligence adviser, Nathalie Drouin, told the Commons public safety committee that she leaked sensitive details to The Washington Post without Trudeau's authorisation but maintained that no classified intelligence was shared. This occurred just before Canada expelled six Indian diplomats on October 13.Tensions between Canada and India have been high, especially after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accused the Indian government of being involved in the murder of a Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar.Drouin explained that the leak was part of a 'communications strategy' with deputy foreign minister David Morrison to ensure a major US publication presented Canada's stance on the foreign interference issue. Drouin added, ""the communications strategy was seen by the Prime Minister's Office.""""We provided non-classified information on the actions we had taken to cooperate with India and explain how the evidence showed links to the government of India conducting illegal activities against Canadians, including threats to their lives,"" Drouin said. She also affirmed that similar briefings were given to federal opposition leaders.Criticising the leak, Conservative party MP Raquel Dancho questioned why the information was not shared with the Canadian public and said, ""In fact, Canadians wouldn't know unless they were able to read The Washington Post. I just find it quite unfair to the Canadian public that details were released in advance to The Washington Post but not provided to Canada.""On October 14, RCMP commissioner Mike Duheme had said, ""India was involved in the killing of three people, but he only identified the slaying of Nijjar."" Duheme also mentioned that ""eight people have been charged with murder and 22 with extortion. Four Indian nationals have been charged in the killing of Nijjar outside a Sikh temple.""Duheme responded to these concerns by saying that the information could impact ongoing criminal investigations, stating, ""It is information as part of an investigation that normally we like to keep within but sometimes we do release some information.""India and Canada have faced ongoing diplomatic issues, including the recent recall of six Indian diplomats by India after Canada declared them ""persons of interest"" in the investigation of Nijjar murder.Trudeau's allegations in the Canadian Parliament last year about India's involvement in Nijjar's killing have been firmly denied by India, which has described the accusations as 'absurd' and 'motivated.'NIA in India is currently investigating six cases involving designated terrorist Gurpatwant Singh Pannu, who holds American and Canadian citizenship.","Canadian officials reportedly accepted leaking information about Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar's killing to The Washington Post.

NEW DELHI: The inauguration of India's first private military aircraft manufacturing facility, launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Spanish counterpart Pedro Sánchez in Vadodara on Monday, marks a significant milestone in the nation's defence-manufacturing landscape.The inauguration is a huge shift towards greater self-reliance in defense production, aligning with the Centre's ' Make in India ' initiative. The facility will primarily focus on the assembly of the Airbus C-295 aircraft, which is set to enhance the capabilities of the Indian Air Force (IAF) while fostering indigenous manufacturing.The facility is expected to become operational by November this year, with the first indigenously manufactured C-295 projected to roll out by September 2026.The C-295 deal, valued at approximately ₹21,935 crore (around $2.5 billion), involves the procurement of 56 aircraft to replace the aging Avro-748 fleet currently used by the IAF. This acquisition is significant for several reasons:The C-295 deal is a cornerstone of the 'Make in India' initiative. By facilitating the local production of military aircraft, this project not only enhances India's defense capabilities but also promotes economic growth through job creation and technology transfer.During the inauguration ceremony, PM Modi emphasised the importance of the facility in bolstering India's defense capabilities and self-reliance, giving a ""boost to our mission of Make in India, Make for the World"".He stated that the establishment of this manufacturing unit represents a new era for India's defense sector, where private participation is crucial for innovation and efficiency.""The aircraft manufactured at this facility will also be exported in future,"" he said, while expressing hope that the ecosystem created by the facility will help India manufacture civil aircraft in future as well.""Today, I am looking beyond just manufacturing transport aircraft. You all must have seen the unprecedented growth and transformation of the country's aviation sector in the last decade. We are already working to make India a hub of aviation and MRO domain. I am sure this ecosystem will pave way for 'Made in India' civil aircraft,"" he said.PM Modi further noted that this initiative aligns with India's broader strategic goals to enhance national security through indigenous capabilities.He remarked on how this project will not only strengthen the IAF but also contribute significantly to India's status as a global player in aerospace manufacturing.The PM reiterated that such initiatives are vital for achieving Atmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India), underscoring the government's commitment to empowering local industries and fostering technological advancements within the country.","The C-295 is a versatile medium tactical transport aircraft capable of performing various missions, including troop transport, cargo delivery, medical evacuation, and maritime patrol. Under this deal, 16 aircraft will be delivered in a fly-away condition from Spain within 48 months, while the remaining 40 will be manufactured in India by Tata Advanced Systems Limited (TASL) at the new facility in Vadodara. The project is expected to generate around 15,000 high- skilled jobs and an additional 10,000 indirect jobs over the next decade.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114689015,imgsize-947372,width-400,resizemode-4/114689015.jpg"

Cyberattacks: India Faces Catastrophic Cyberattack Surge: 17 Trillion Projections by 2047,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-faces-catastrophic-cyberattack-surge-17-trillion-projections-by-2047/articleshow/114744059.cms,"NEW DELHI: If left unchecked, India could attract nearly 1 trillion cyberattacks annually by 2033, and by the time it turns 100 in 2047, the country could be a target of 17 trillion cyberattacks, according to projections. Cybersecurity experts on Tuesday expressed concern at the increase in cases of cyberattacks and stressed the need for stronger measures to tackle the problem.Non-profit Prahar released a report indicating the urgent need for a robust, large-scale cyber defence apparatus.The report highlights how the rapid expansion in India's digital ecosystem leaves it open to risks. Cyberattacks on AIIMS and airlines by clandestine cyber entities are cases in point.In 2023, the country faced over 79 million cyberattacks, 15% more than in the previous year, ranking it third globally in terms of the number of such incidents. The escalation has continued into 2024. In the first quarter, there has been a sharp rise in cyberattacks, with over 500 million incidents in just three months. A recent report highlighted a 46% increase in cyberattacks in the second quarter than in the same period in 2023.This surge highlighted a growing need for stronger cybersecurity measures across industries, particularly in sectors increasingly targeted by cybercriminals. Globally, cyberattacks increased 76% in the first quarter of 2024, with India among the most affected countries. In the first four months of 2024, Indians lost more than Rs 1,750 crore to cybercriminals, reported through 7.4 lakh complaints on the NationalCybercrime Reporting Portal.Prahar's report, ‘The Invisible Hand', highlighted how critical infrastructure hacking and sophisticated manipulation of its citizens were core components of these new forms of vulnerabilities and attacks. It underlined the necessity of a well-planned, five-year national cybersecurity strategy and suggested that all IT-related infrastructure be consolidated under one organisation or ministry for focused efforts.The report also explores the dangers posed by betting and gaming apps with hidden, orchestrated strategies at play. ""There are two types of cyberattacks. The first involves traditional hackers who exploit vulnerabilities in systems for financial gain or disruption. The second, more insidious form targets citizens, recruiting them to engage in anti-national activities through manipulation, coercion, or threats,"" pointed out Abhay Mishra, president, Prahar.""Such tactics are most likely to be used on illegal betting apps. This tactic also resembles approaches deployed in Bangladesh, where adversaries managed to turn ordinary citizens into instruments of destabilisation, undermining govt institutions from within.""Retired IPS Muktesh Chander, former special commissioner, Delhi Police, said, ""A situation has arisen where not only individual hackers or disgruntled people, but also state-sponsored actors and states themselves are engaging in activities that sabotage important parameters of the economy.""","In 2023, the country faced over 79 million cyberattacks, 15% more than in the previous year.

The Election Commission should very seriously not only consider but take the initiative of taking this country back to paper ballots. Democracy is too precious to be left to technology.""This statement came after ECI dismissed Congress's allegations of irregularities in the recent Haryana elections , calling them ""baseless, misplaced, and devoid of facts.""In a letter to the grand old party on Tuesday, the ECI urged them to avoid making unfounded claims post-elections and accused the party of raising ""generic"" doubts without evidence. ECI warned that such irresponsible allegations could lead to public unrest and chaos, especially during sensitive times such as polling and counting days.Tewari also questioned the battery life of EVMs, expressing skepticism. He said, ""It absolutely defies any law of science that a machine, an EVM, can be in use for a whole day from 8 in the morning till 6 in the evening or from 9 in the morning till 5 in the evening and have 99% battery life once the machine is powered down, it is stored in a strong room and then brought out a couple of days later and the votes are counted.""Addressing the issue from the Bharatiya Janata Party 's side, leader Tarun Chugh lambasted the Congress party , referring to it as a ""sinking ship"" and blamed it for questioning the efficacy of EVMs after electoral losses.Chugh commented, ""Congress is a sinking ship which is thoughtless and policy less...They blame the EVM for their loss (in the election). The Congress party, whenever it wins an election, whether it's in Karnataka or Telangana at that time, considers EVM and the election commission to be okay...Despite losing so many elections their ego is high.""","Congress MP Manish Tewari suggested that the Election Commission of India (ECI) should consider returning to paper ballots.

This will be his first visit to both Guyana and Nigeria which are members of the Global South community.While the visit to Nigeria will help underscore the importance India attaches to one of the largest countries in Africa in articulating the voice of the developing world on multilateral platforms like the UN, G77 and NAM, the visit to Guyana is important for India’s relations with CARICOM (Caribbean Community) that comprises 15 member-states and 5 associate members.A CARICOM-India summit is likely to take place in capital Georgetown during Modi’s visit, according to diplomatic sources. Modi had first held a summit meeting with CARICOM leaders on the margins of the UNGA in New York in 2019 where he, according to the Indian government, reiterated India’s commitment to strengthen its political, economic and cultural engagement with CARICOM. He had then highlighted the presence of more than a million-strong Indian diaspora as a “vibrant and enduring link of friendship with the Caribbean”.Modi had also announced $ 14 million grant for community development projects in the CARICOM and another $ 150 million Line of Credit for solar, renewable energy and climate- change related projects.

Earlier, ED had returned flats in Gurgaon to their owners who were allegedly cheated by real estate developers and refunded money to small investors who became victims of Kolkata’s Rose Valley chit fund ‘scam’.On Wednesday, ED said, “The directorate’s Chandigarh office has successfully returned properties valued over 185 crore from Surya Pharmaceuticals Ltd to the SBI-led consortium of banks through the official liquidator as part of its ongoing efforts to restore the proceeds of crime to the rightful victims and claimants of the offence of money laundering.”A special court in Chandigarh on Oct 25 allowed the sale of assets and its restitution to SBI, which had earlier filed a complaint of loan fraud of 829 crore against the accused. The court had also issued non-bailable warrants against directors Rajiv Goyal and Alka Goyal, who had fled the country and were subsequently declared proclaimed offenders in 2017, before ED could initiate its money laundering case.The restitution comes in record time, within six months of ED filing its charge-sheet against the accused Goyals in April. ED will soon move courts for declaring them as fugitives under the Fugitive Economic Offenders Act to initiate their extradition to India.The restitution order came after ED held meetings with the lending banks and the official liquidator, appointed by the NCLT, assisting them in filing a restitution application before the special court in Chandigarh.","The attached assets include a building and superstructure on 80 kanals of land, along with plant and machinery, located in Samba in Jammu.

Earlier, only poor and vulnerable families and a few specific categories of workers, like ASHA staff, were eligible for the scheme that offers health cover of Rs 5 lakh per family per year for secondary and tertiary-care hospitalisation.Anyone aged 70 years or above can apply for the Ayushman Bharat Senior Citizen Scheme on the website, www.beneficiary.nha.gov.in, or by using the Ayushman App (available for Android on the Google Play Store). Beneficiaries simply need to verify their identity and eligibility through Aadhaar e-KYC . Aadhaar serves as the primary document for confirming both the beneficiary’s age and state of residence and is the only document required to complete the registration process.Yes. Family members can register the eligible an beneficiary through beneficiary login option on the mobile app and website. All they must do is to enter their mobile number and put in the OTP that’s generated to initiate the enrolment process. One can also visit the nearest empanelled hospital and get themselves enrolled.AB PM-JAY is a completely cashless scheme, and govt sources said payments are made to hospitals against the treatment provided to eligible beneficiaries. Empanelled hospitals are mandated to offer cashless treatment to beneficiaries. One can lodge grievances on the AB PM-JAY website or through the national call centre ‘14555’, mail, letter, fax etc. Any complaint regarding denial of treatment by an empaneled hospital is to be seen as an SOS grievance and a ‘turn around time’ of 6 hours has been set for resolving it.Such beneficiaries will have to re-initiate their Aadhaar based e-KYC via the website or mobile app to be registered as a beneficiary under the senior citizen scheme.The list of empanelled hospitals for Ayushman Bharat PM-JAY scheme is available on the website www.dashboard.pmjay.gov.in. As of Sept 30, approximately 30,000 hospitals across the country are empanelled to provide benefits under the scheme, which is run overall by the National Health Authority. The list includes 190 leading corporate hospitals like Centre For Sight (Delhi), Medanta-The Medicity (Gurugram), Metro Hospital and Heart Institute (Noida), Fortis Escorts Hospital (Jaipur), Yashoda Super Speciality Hospital & Heart Institute (Ghaziabad), etc.Public health and hospitals being a state subject under the Indian Constitution, state health agencies (SHAs) are mandated to empanel hospitals under Ayushman Bharat PM-JAY.Beneficiaries can visit any empanelled hospital, present either their Ayushman card or their PMJAY ID to receive treatment. Before visiting, the beneficiary should confirm that the hospital is empanelled to treat the specific condition for which they require assistance.Nearly all treatments covered by the scheme cost below Rs 2 lakh and, so, the Rs 5 lakh cover is sufficient to meet beneficiaries’ healthcare needs, govt sources said. Further, under the umbrella scheme of Rashtriya Arogya Nidhi (RAN), financial assistance up to Rs 15 lakh is provided to patients from poor families — who are eligible for PM-JAY — for availing those treatments that are not covered under PM-JAY. Hence, AB PM-JAY along with other central govt schemes can take care of hospitalisation needs of eligible beneficiaries.No. With these states not implementing the scheme, elderly citizens cannot join or receive the benefits of AB PM-JAY.","Those aged 70 years and above can now benefit from the expansion of the Ayushman Bharat-Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana.

On Dec 9, 2022, Chinese troops had tried to transgress across the LAC at Yangtse in the Tawang sector to unilaterally change the status quo, which had led to a major physical clash between the rival troops leaving several injured on both sides.Speaking at a ‘Barakhana’ at the 4 Corps HQ in Tezpur, even as India and China completed disengagement at Depsang and Demchok in eastern Ladakh on Wednesday, Singh said, “India and China were in diplomatic and military talks to resolve their conflicts in some areas along the LAC. We have reached a consensus following our continuous efforts.”“We achieved this success due to your discipline and courage,” Singh told soldiers, adding that the govt would continue this process of peace restoration on the basis of the consensus.“Former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee used to say we can change our friends but not our neighbours. We believe in keeping cordial relations with our neighbours. This is India’s clear policy. However, sometimes situations arise and one has to ensure the safety and security of the borders. Keeping in mind the interests of our forces, the govt will take necessary steps in this process of peace restoration,” he said.Singh will visit Tawang on Thursday to inaugurate the Museum of Valour dedicated to Major Ralengnao Bob Khathing and unveil a statue of Sardar Patel.“The heroic deed of Major Ralengnao Bob Khathing, who bravely led an expedition in February 1951 to bring the Indian administration to Tawang, has no parallel in human history. What ‘Iron Man’ Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel did as India’s first home minister by integrating several princely states into the country leaves us forever indebted to him,” Arunachal Pradesh CM Pema Khandu said on X. The two monuments dedicated to the great and brave souls will always remind people of their critical contribution to the country's integrity and sovereignty, Khandu said. In Tezpur, Singh was briefed by Army commanders on infrastructure development along the LAC and the employment of cutting-edge military equipment and technology to enhance operational efficiency.",India will continue process to restore peace along the Line of Actual Control on the basis of the consensus achieved with China.

This could enable a streamlined, paperless process for candidates to register, access, and complete exams, possibly even remotely.”While the committee was set up amid allegations of NEET-UG paper leak, it was entrusted to recommend comprehensive entrance exam reforms in the country. Against this backdrop, the committee in its phase 1 implementation, recommended five-point restructuring of NTA — empowered and accountable of governing body with eminent domain experts; strengthening of the agency with additional manpower; and 10 verticals of NTA encompassing research and development, test security, test centres infrastructure, and international collaboration, among others.The panel also recommended several measures to prevent breaches and malpractices in pen-paper test (PPT) and computer based test (CBT), biometric verification at all levels i.e., registration, test centre, and counselling and during admission time.The phase 2 or the long-term plan called for “collaboration with KV (Kendriya Vidyalayas), NV (Navodaya Vidyalayas), higher educational institute for developing state of the art digital and test centre (physical) infrastructure, empowering of higher secondary school system, and research in educational testing.The panel led by former Isro chief R Radhakrishnan, submitted its report to the govt last week. It also recommended major revamping of the National Testing Agency (NTA).

Canada admits to leaking information on Indian officials to US paper,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/canada-admits-to-leaking-information-on-indian-officials-to-us-paper/articleshow/114791015.cms,"Canadian govt has admitted it leaked sensitive information to The Washington Post about the alleged involvement of Indian govt officials and agents in criminal activities in Canada that led to the withdrawal of Indian high commissioner Sanjay Verma and five other diplomats from the country. Canada had said it “expelled” the diplomats after India refused to waive their diplomatic immunity.Canadian NSA Nathalie Drouin told a parliamentary panel on Tuesday that information was leaked to the newspaper to counter alleged disinformation by India and it was a “strategic decision to engage a respected international news outlet that had already published on the subject to ensure the record was straight”. Canada’s Globe and Mail had carried a report identifying Drouin and deputy foreign minister David Morrison as officials who briefed the newspaper.One of the allegations mentioned in the Post report was that India’s home minister Amit Shah had authorised attacks on Canadian Sikhs — pro-Khalistani separatists — in the country. Morrison, who was also present at the parliamentary hearing, admitted he had “confirmed” Shah’s alleged involvement to the Post reporter.He also said he had not on his own shared that information but only confirmed it when the reporter asked him about it. “The journalist called me and asked if it was that person. I confirmed it was that person,” Morrison told the panel, without elaborating.Morrison had been asked by Raquel Dancho, MP of opposition Conservative Party, who during the hearing raised the issue of Trudeau govt passing on information to the Post.While there was no official response by India to Canada’s public naming of Shah, govt sources here maintained that these latest assertions by Canadian authorities were again not backed by any evidence. A Reuters report quoted anonymous govt sources as saying Canada’s claim was based on “very weak and flimsy” evidence.India has maintained since the allegations first surfaced, in the form of a statement made by Canadian PM Justin Trudeau in Parliament last year, about the involvement of Indian officials in a murder-for-hire plot that Ottawa has shared no evidence or actionable information to back its claims.Canada's NSA Nathalie Drouin also said Canadian and Indian security officials had met at least seven times since Aug last year and claimed that Canada had “evidence” about the involvement of Indian officials in gathering information through coercion and threats. “This information is then shared with senior levels of the government of India who then direct the commission of serious criminal activities against Indo-Canadians to the kinetic views of the Lawrence Bishnoi organised crime network,” she said.

But it may turn ‘severe’ on these days if additional emissions from firecrackers and stubble or waste fires add to the city’s pollution.The day’s average Air Quality Index (AQI), on a scale of 0 to 500, was 307 at 4pm, with two stations (Anand Vihar and Mundka) reporting severe air quality. It added that winds may vary from four to 20 kmph on Diwali with the possibility of mist in the morning and a mainly clear sky. The wind speed will drop a day after Diwali.Anand Vihar had the worst air quality in the city on Wednesday with an AQI of 407, followed by Mundka at 401. The city’s AQI, however, kept worsening towards late evening due to calm winds.“The air quality may reach the severe category on Oct 31 and Nov 01 in case of additional emissions from firecrackers and stubble/waste fires. Outlook for the subsequent six days: Very poor to severe,” stated IITM's air quality early warning system.A day earlier (Tuesday), the city’s average AQI was 268, in the poor zone. An AQI of 201 to 300 is considered poor, 301 to 400 very poor, while a value between 401 and 500 is considered severe.As per IITM’s Decision Support System (DSS), while the share of stubble burning in the city’s PM2.5 levels increased slightly to 3.4% on Tuesday, against 1.8% on Monday, it was still low and local sources had more impact on the city’s air quality. The DSS shares display the actual share of stubble burning for the previous day.On Wednesday, transport remained the major source of pollution in the city, contributing 16.2% of all pollution, followed by pollution coming from Gautam Budh Nagar (7.4%), Faridabad (7.3%), Ghaziabad (4.3%), residential emissions (4.2%), industries (3.7%), Gurgaon (3.5%), and construction sector (2.1%).According to CPCB, PM2.5 levels on Wednesday oscillated between 104 to 166.6 micrograms per cubic metre – rising as the day proceeded, while the national safe standard for PM2.5 is 60 units, and the WHO has set the limit at 15 units for 24 hours.","The day’s average Air Quality Index (AQI), on a scale of 0 to 500, was 307 at 4pm.

"After 4.5 years, India to resume patrols in Demchok, Depsang",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-4-5-years-india-to-resume-patrols-in-demchok-depsang/articleshow/114790463.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Army will begin initial patrols on Thursday to a few places where its access was blocked by Chinese troops in the Depsang and Demchok areas of eastern Ladakh for the last four and a half years, in a significant development that India hopes will eventually lead to de-escalation along the entire Line of Actual Control.The resumption of patrolling will come after the two armies on Wednesday completed the phased disengagement and verification process, both physically on the ground as well as through aerial surveillance by drones and satellites, at the two remaining face-off sites in the Depsang Plains and the Charding Ninglung Nallah track junction near Demchok.“The aerial verification of Demchok was completed on Wednesday morning after getting delayed by a day due to bad weather. In the evening, the rival ground commanders met at two points in Depsang and one at Demchok for the final confirmation of the dismantling of temporary posts and structures as well as the mutual pullback of troops to pre-April 2020 positions,” a top defence source told TOI.With the 10-day disengagement and verification going off without a major hitch, the Army will “launch some initial patrolling on Thursday and progressively expand it to full-fledged patrols to all areas over the coming days and weeks”, he added.The thaw in the bone-chilling conditions in the high-altitude region will be marked by the exchange of sweets between the rival troops at several locations to mark Diwali on Thursday.The yawning trust deficit, however, will take time to bridge. “A close watch will be kept on the People’s Liberation Army to ensure its does not renege from the pact on the coordinated Depsang-Demchok patrolling arrangements announced on Oct 21, under which each side will inform the other in advance about its patrols to prevent clashes,” said another source.While ground commanders of the rank of Brigadiers and below will continue to meet regularly to discuss modalities as before, sources said the next major step will be for rival corps commanders of Lieutenant General-rank to meet after the situation stabilises in Depsang-Demchok to discuss the resumption of patrolling rights in the “buffer zones” created earlier.The ‘no-patrol’ buffer zones after the earlier disengagements at Galwan, north bank of Pangong Tso, the Kailash Range and the larger Gogra-Hot Springs area, varying from 3km to 10km, largely came up on what India considers to be its own territory.“These buffer zones with patrolling restrictions, with the last one coming up in Sept 2022, were supposed to be temporary arrangements. Our troops will now get unhindered access to their five traditional patrolling points (PPs) in Depsang and two in Demchok since no buffer zones have been created there. But the question of the earlier buffer zones also needs to be resolved,” the source said.There is no longer any eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation in eastern Ladakh, with the disengagement now taking place in the last two of the seven major face-off points that arose after PLA’s multiple incursions into eastern Ladakh in April-May 2020 that caught India completely off guard. This will, hopefully, ensure there is no sudden inadvertent vertical escalation on the ground.The rival armies, however, continue to be ranged against each other all along the 3,488km LAC, with over 50,000 troops from each side forward deployed with tanks, howitzers, surface-to-air missiles and the like in eastern Ladakh.Another 90,000 PLA troops are similarly forward deployed across Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim, with “matching mirror deployments” by India. Talks are also under way to ease the tensions in “sensitive” areas like Yangtse, Asaphila and Subansiri river valley in Arunachal Pradesh, as reported by TOI earlier.In eastern Ladakh, India wants China to agree to the sequential process of disengagement being followed by de-escalation and then de-induction of forward deployed troops. “The Chinese threat will remain till there is de-induction,” a senior official said.",The resumption of patrolling will come after the two armies on Wednesday completed the phased disengagement and verification process.

NEW DELHI: In a session organized by the Merchant Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Chinese Ambassador to India, Xu Feihong, described the recent meeting between Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping as “very important.” The two leaders, meeting formally for the first time in five years on October 23 during the BRICS Summit in Kazan, Russia, reached what Xu called “important common understandings” that could steer India-China relations back on a path of “steady development.”Calling it a pivotal encounter, Xu highlighted that the talks established guidelines for future relations, setting both nations on a trajectory toward “improving and developing” their bilateral ties . Addressing the session attendees, Xu emphasized the shared commitment of the two nations to “move forward smoothly,” despite lingering tensions, particularly in regions like Eastern Ladakh.Reflecting on the recent progress in the border disengagement, Xu expressed hope that such “specific disagreements” would no longer disrupt the broader relationship, saying, “The most important thing is how to handle the differences.”On a lighter note, Xu welcomed the resumption of direct flights between India and China, which he sees as a practical step toward fostering smoother cooperation. “As an ambassador, I am looking forward to this as it saves time,” he remarked, underscoring his optimism for robust collaborations in not just political spheres but also in business and cultural exchange.The Modi-Xi meeting , he suggested, is a fresh start for both sides, with each ready to redefine their shared journey.","Chinese Ambassador to India, Xu Feihong, described the recent meeting between Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping as “very important” The two leaders, meeting formally for the first time in five years on October 23 during the BRICS Summit in Kazan, Russia, reached “important common understandings”","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114787330,imgsize-1848398,width-400,resizemode-4/114787330.jpg"
Pandit Dhruba Ghosh: From Japan to Juhu: Kyoto-based sarangi player recounts strings attached to Mumbai,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/from-japan-to-juhu-kyoto-based-sarangi-player-recounts-strings-attached-to-mumbai/articleshow/114784293.cms,"Yuji Nakagawa (Photo: X)

In a crowded Churchgate-bound local, Yuji Nakagawa looks less like a classical musician headed to the NCPA and more like a sportsperson rushing to Oval Maidan. Masquerading as a bat in the tennis racquet kit on this Kyoto-based Japanese national's right shoulder, is a string instrument that used to signal crisis to a generation of Hindi movie buffs.It was 15 years ago in 2009 that the wistful allure of the sarangi had made this former guitar player move from Osaka, where the train doors close to Mumbai, where they don't. Several misal pavs, Hindi lessons and nail injuries later, Nakagawa, it seemed, had not only mastered the bowed instrument under the hawk eye of his Juhu-based guru Pandit Dhruba Ghosh but also mustered the courage to do in packed Mumbai trains what he would never do in packed trains in Japan: tap a shoulder. ""Here, I can easily ask for help placing the instrument on a shelf. In Japan, I'm scared. People tend to keep their distance,"" says Nakagawa as he prepares to sling his tennis racquet bag over the shoulder of his silk kurta once again.This evening, alongside tabla player with whom he once shared a rented flat in Juhu, the seasoned Kyoto-based sarangi player--who performs in India twice a year--will ascend a stage in South Mumbai and try to showcase all that his late guru taught him for eight years before his passing in 2017. ""Look right at the centre of the sound,"" Ghosh would demand in Bengali each time his pupil's attention tended to waver. ""The melody should resemble a kite flying in the air,"" the ustad would say, urging Nakagawa, his senior-most disciple, to coax ragas that would float as breezily as the emotion ran deep.Entailing odd hours, the training in the rigorous guru-shishya parampara--supported in part by an Indian Council of Cultural Relations scholarship from 2009 to 2015--reminded him often of his home country whose creative legacy is steeped in a similar teacher-student dynamic. Incidentally, it was in Tokyo of the mid-2000s, that this student first met his future Indian guru. By then, Nakagawa owned a sarangi from Varanasi, where he had spent two months learning from Ustad Faiyaz Ali Khan in 2003. His first real encounter with the sarangi, though, happened the previous year in Nepal.Having befriended a folk musician in Kathmandu during a sight-seeing tour fresh in the wake of graduation, the blues fan returned home to Japan with a four-stringed sarangi gifted by the Nepalese local in 2002. On spotting this rare India-adjacent folk instrument in Osaka, a local Japanese tabla player had excitedly asked Nakagawa to accompany him onstage. The result was mutual regret. ""At that time, I had no knowledge of Indian music. I messed up badly onstage. He was very upset,"" recalls Nakagawa.Keen to dive deep into Indian classical music--a genre that Japan then saw as ""exotic""--Nakagawa scoured music shops in Japan of the noughties for audio CDs and stumbled upon one by Pandit Dhruba Ghosh. ""I was mesmerized on hearing it,"" says the then Osaka resident who lugged his sarangi on a bullet train to Tokyo in 2004 when he realized Ghosh was going to perform there. ""After the show, I told Pandit Dhruba I was keen to learn from him. He asked me to give him a demonstration of my skills,"" recalls Nakagawa, whose cuticles nervously worked the strings made of goat intestines, filling the ustad's hotel room with the evening tune of raag Yaman. Five years later, Ghosh's home in Juhu doubled up as a musical dojo to Nakagawa. ""He would only speak to me in Bengali, never in Hindi,"" recalls Nakagawa about the hard-to-please Ghosh who--after his pupil's first public performance in a college--had merely relented: ""Thik ache"".While he says he isn't fluent in Bengali, Nakagawa sounds pretty convincing when he spouts Mumbai-style Hindi. ""All the notations in the textbooks at Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan where I studied were in Hindi,"" recalls Nakagawa who has performed extensively as a soloist and has accompanied many eminent Hindustani classical musicians . ""I am an outsider to this genre. So, I feel very lucky to be given a chance to share the stage with great vocalists and masters,"" says Nakagawa, who has won several awards.Though he doesn't have a favourite raga, he seems drawn to Raag Shree--a calming tune he can be seen performing in a video interview. ""My guru used to say, whenever you have a problem, play Raag Shree ,"" confesses the Japanese musician in the video. The raga would likely have come in handy during a recital in Kolhapur, where his otherwise misal-favouring gut took a long time to recover from a jaunt to an eye-wateringly spicy misal eatery. ""That, and Andhra food, I cannot take,"" laughs Nakagawa who now prefers Indian cuisine over Japanese fare.So far, Nakagawa has given solo and ensemble performances in countries including Thailand, Singapore, the Netherlands, Canada and Japan. While the Netherlands is more exposed to Indian classical music , Japan, he says, is still learning about it. Canada and Singapore, with their vast Indian diaspora, too, display a grounding in it. However, in India, apart from airport security guards from Rajasthan--who can easily identify the instrument in his heavy fibreglass case--many uninitiated strangers have mistaken his sarangi for a sitar.""We should perform more in schools and colleges,"" says Nakagawa, when asked if young people show a keen interest in the overshadowed Indian instrument. While most of his audience in India is grey-haired, the sarangi players' students include US-based Indian kids apart from Japanese school goers. He is happy to be back in Juhu where--unlike Japan--the neighbours don't mind his nocturnal riyaaz. ""In Japan, I can only practise between 10 am and 5pm,"" he says.",Yuji Nakagawa is a seasoned Kyoto-based sarangi player who performs in India twice a year.

The Kakinada green ammonia plant is scheduled to start production in the second half of 2026.Electrolysers are used to split water into hydrogen and oxygen and are critical for producing low-emission hydrogen from renewable or nuclear electricity.As a part of this agreement, John Cockerill and AM Green will also be developing India's largest electrolyser manufacturing plant with a 2 GW per year capacity in Kakinada, contributing to the country's green hydrogen production target under the National Green Hydrogen Mission, AM Green said.The plant will supply the second phase of 640MW of electrolysers to AM Green’s Kakinada project.AM Green is eyeing a 5 MTPA of green ammonia capacity by 2030, which will be equivalent to approximately 1 MTPA of green hydrogen, accounting for one-fifth of India’s target for green hydrogen production under the National Green Hydrogen Mission and 10 percent of Europe’s target for green hydrogen imports.The Kakinada facility has already been certified by CertifHy as compliant with EU RFNBO requirements for green ammonia, including additionality and renewable energy timeliness.AM Green has already executed offtake agreements for this project with major players for intended end use in a range of green hydrogen applications.AM Green group chairman Anil Chalamalasetty said the strategic partnership with John Cockerill marks a significant step toward creating a robust green hydrogen ecosystem in India. “This collaboration will position the country as a leading export hub for lowest cost green molecules that adhere to the highest standards, including EU RFNBO norms. With this collaboration, we are not just advancing India’s green hydrogen goals, but also decarbonising industries globally like refining, shipping, fertilisers, power generation, and chemicals,” he explained.’Terming it as a first-of-its-kind hydrogen project, John Cockerill CEO François Michel said the company’s advanced electrolysis technology, combined with renewable energy solutions, will play a key role in the mass adoption of green hydrogen and green derivatives in the region and beyond.",AM Green has placed what is touted as India’s largest electrolyser order with John Cockerill Hydrogen for 1.3GW of advanced pressurized alkaline electroyser.

"The Income Tax Act, 2025 – Last lap towards achieving the milestone?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/the-income-tax-act-2025-last-lap-towards-achieving-the-milestone/articleshow/114786304.cms,"It is presently unknown whether the simplification would be through changes in the existing law or introduction of a new Income Tax Act.

By Ashish Jain, Tax Partner, EY India

Journey so far….

Amendments by the Finance Act (No. 2), 2024

The Road ahead….

Currently, there are multiple tax regimes and rates which coexist for different classes of taxpayers. For instance, corporate taxpayers have basic tax rates ranging from 15% to 30%, LLP’s/ partnership firms are subject to a high tax rate of 30%, individuals have the option of the old and default tax regime, etc. It may be desirable to simplify the rates preferably by having maximum two tax rates (one for new manufacturing companies as contemplated under section 115BAB of the Act i.e. 15% and another tax rate of 22% for other corporates without incentives and deduction) for corporate and one tax regime for other classes of taxpayer. Further, surcharge and cess may be done away with and tax rate may be rationalised to that extent.

There are multiple rates and conditions prescribed for ensuring compliance with provisions related to TDS /TCS provisions. With the Government’s intention to track transactions by bringing them under the TDS/ TCS net, it would be convenient if the same is further classified into fewer rates and compliances with various provisions like section 194R can be simplified with the intended objective.

There are certain adjustments/ additions made by CPC basis the difference in reporting as per ITR utility and processing by the CPC return processing software. Also, since CPC is faceless, resolution of queries regarding refunds, adjustments, etc. can be time consuming. Simpler procedures and clarity on steps/ actions required by taxpayers (including time bound resolution by CPC) would go a long way in making the CPC more effective.

There are time limits prescribed in the current law regarding disposal of OGE’s/ rectification applications by the tax department. However, there are instances whereby said timelines are not adhered to leading to protracted litigation. It is expected that suitable amendments/ directions are issued by the Government to provide for stricter enforcement of timelines with respect to OGE’s/ rectifications and similar proceedings.

As per the tax department, around 3.60 lacs appeals are pending at the first appellate level as on 1 July 2024. It is the need of the hour to provide stricter enforcement of the law for a time bound disposal of appeals at the first appellate level to reduce litigation burden.

Manthan Shah, Senior Tax Professional, EY India and Bhavesh Kumar, Senior Tax Professional, EY India also contributed to this article. Views expressed are personal.

It has been the stated intention of the present and past Governments that there is a need to simplify the direct tax laws of India. Steps in this direction includes, but not limited to, the proposal to introduce the Direct Tax Code , 2009 (‘DTC’). As per the then Hon’ble Finance Minister’s speech, the DTC was intended to consolidate and amend the law relating to all direct taxes, thereby simplifying the tax structure, improving compliance and enhancing the efficiency of the tax administration. Although the DTC was not implemented, its introduction underscored the pressing need for reform and set the stage for subsequent steps in this direction to simplify India’s direct tax framework.The Union Budgets from the years 2020 to 2023 have brought some amendments in this regard with introduction of certain taxpayer-friendly measures. Illustratively, a new simplified personal income tax regime, introduction of the Vivad Se Vishwas Act, 2020 to reduce pending litigation, exemptions for non-residents from filing Return of Income (‘ROI’) under specific conditions, incorporating pre-filled income tax return details, deploying Joint Commissioner of Income-tax (Appeals) to expedite small appeals, introducing amendments to promote timely payments to Micro and Small Enterprises and so on.The Finance Act (No. 2), 2024 [‘FA (No. 2), 2024’] has taken a significant leap in the journey towards direct tax simplification. The Hon’ble Finance Minister announced a review of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (‘the Act’) to make it concise, clear, and easy to understand. This aims to reduce disputes and litigation, providing tax certainty and fostering a more transparent and efficient tax system.In line with the above, the FA (No. 2), 2024 has introduced amendments aimed at simplifying the provisions of the Act. Some of these amendments are rationalisation of holding period and rate of tax for capital gains purposes, introduction of Vivad Se Vishwas Scheme, 2024, removal of 2% equalisation levy and angel tax provisions, rationalisation of certain Tax Deducted at Source (‘TDS’) rates, etc.While the Government's efforts to simplify direct tax laws in India dates to the year 2009, recent amendments in Union Budgets and more particularly in the FA (No. 2), 2024 seem to have accelerated the efforts towards simplification.This is further supported by the fact that while moving the Finance Bill (No. 2), 2024 for approval by the Lok Sabha on 7 August 2024, the Hon’ble Finance Minister introduced certain amendments. While the amendments were largely intended to address certain ambiguities/ uncertainties from the proposals in the Bill, one notable amendment was restoration of indexation benefit for computing long term capital gains on sale of immovable property acquired before 23 July 2024 by resident individual or Hindu Undivided Family (‘HUF’).One would expect the review of the Act to bring in amendments which would not only simplify the existing direct tax law but also bring greater certainty to taxpayers and aim at reducing litigation. Following are certain illustrative amendments which one would desire to be made in the new avatar of the income tax law:It is presently unknown whether the simplification would be through changes in the existing law or introduction of a new Act. If the Government can deliver its stated objective effectively in a defined time frame, it would not only boost investor confidence but also help in widening the tax base thereby contributing to the Government’s overall objective to make India ‘Viksit Bharat’ by 2047.",It is unknown whether the simplification would be through changes in the existing law or introduction of a new Income Tax Act. There are multiple rates and conditions prescribed for ensuring compliance with provisions related to TDS /TCS provisions. Simpler procedures and clarity on steps/ actions required by taxpayers would go a long way in making the CPC more effective.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114786373,imgsize-66944,width-400,resizemode-4/114786373.jpg"

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Driving the news

According to reports, Chinese authorities are targeting revelers in Shanghai who gathered in popular nightlife spots dressed in Halloween costumes.

who gathered in popular nightlife spots dressed in Halloween costumes. Videos circulating on social media show police imposing crowd control and restricting pedestrian flow, in some cases, escorting costumed partygoers—including those dressed as Donald Trump and superheroes like Batman and Superman—away from public spaces, news report said.

The scene contrasts sharply with last year’s festivities, which drew widespread attention and even a nod from the Shanghai municipal government as a symbol of ""cultural tolerance.""

A bar and restaurant owner in the Jing An nightlife district of Shanghai was asked to sign an agreement issued by the local district authorities pledging they would not organise any activities such as costume contests ""to maintain good social order and public image"", he told Reuters.

However, with tightened restrictions this year, social media users have expressed concerns that Halloween, once an opportunity for social commentary, is becoming another casualty in the narrowing space for personal freedom in China.

The news of Shanghai's crackdown on Halloween was a trending topic on Chinese social media sites, including Weibo.

""Even in relatively open Shanghai, the scale of freedom is constantly shrinking,"" one user posted.

Why it matters

Halloween has gained popularity among young Chinese in recent years as a platform for self-expression, a rare outlet in an otherwise tightly controlled society. Since last year's celebrations openly mocked government policies through costumes—like hazmat suits symbolizing strict Covid-19 lockdowns—the Chinese government is likely wary that the festival could ignite further expressions of dissent or even inspire protests akin to the rare, anti-lockdown demonstrations from last year.

Authorities in Shanghai seem determined to prevent any recurrence of last year’s outspoken festivities, which could signal a broader crackdown on public gatherings and, more subtly, on displays of Western cultural influence.

The big picture

China's youth unemployment, currently high, and general economic stagnation have led to widespread frustration, and last year, many used Halloween as a way to express these concerns.

Some students dressed as unemployed graduates, while others donned costumes poking fun at government restrictions.

The mood mirrored a wider, underlying discontent, exacerbated by the pandemic’s lingering economic effects and the government's strict zero-Covid measures, which only lifted last year.

With this year’s tighter restrictions, analysts suggest authorities are aiming to curb any gathering that could serve as a platform for social criticism, particularly after the White Paper Protests in 2022, when young people took to the streets to challenge pandemic policies and highlight issues from economic stagnation to censorship.

The crackdown on Halloween is viewed by many as a preemptive measure to deter similar forms of public expression.

Between the lines

The bottom line

While Halloween celebrations were once a sign of Shanghai’s “cultural tolerance,” the restrictions this year suggest that China’s social landscape may be narrowing under tightened controls.

For China’s young people, who once saw the holiday as a chance to voice their frustrations, the crackdown serves as a stark reminder of the limits on public expression in an increasingly monitored society. The question now is whether this Halloween marks the beginning of a new phase in China’s oversight of public gatherings—and what it means for young Chinese eager to express themselves, even within the limited bounds of a Western holiday.

As Michael Luo put it, “It’s obviously a very happy holiday. Even though it’s foreign culture, it’s still quite fun.” For now, however, that fun seems overshadowed by the mounting restrictions shaping life in China’s most cosmopolitan city.

What’s next

The government’s approach raises questions about the future of Halloween—and similar Western-inspired events—in China. Although some official celebrations went ahead at theme parks like Shanghai Disneyland , smaller gatherings at bars and parks faced restrictions, and local authorities discouraged costume-themed gatherings.

, smaller gatherings at bars and parks faced restrictions, and local authorities discouraged costume-themed gatherings. Shanghai Disneyland, however, proceeded with its annual Halloween event, drawing significant attention as one of the few venues spared from restrictions. Still, many wonder if even these authorized events might come under scrutiny if Halloween continues to serve as a platform for social commentary.

The government’s wariness of gatherings perceived as implicitly critical of policies could extend to other Western-inspired events like Christmas, which has also gained traction in Chinese cities.

Chinese authorities have shown unprecedented concern over Halloween celebrations this year, implementing stricter controls and issuing warnings across major cities. This heightened scrutiny stems from several factors affecting the nation's social and cultural landscape.This year, videos posted on Chinese social media show officers actively targeting people in costumes, asking some to remove makeup or refrain from wearing “bizarre” clothing. As per a New York Times report, Shanghai resident Michael Luo, a bar owner, voiced frustration over the crackdown, calling it “a waste of resources.” He added that authorities should focus on ensuring public safety and enjoyment rather than stifling celebrations, which are popular even in non-Westernized settings like China.In contrast, some netizens on Weibo expressed disappointment at the heavy police presence, lamenting the restriction of cultural events. “Shanghai is not supposed to be like this,” one user wrote, criticizing the city’s perceived shift from tolerance to repression, the CNN report said.Last year’s Halloween in Shanghai was notable not just for its turnout but for its tone—many young people used costumes to comment on China’s social and economic landscape. A popular costume last year featured blank sheets of paper, an ironic reference to China’s censorship, while others dressed as Covd testers or stock market crash victims. Revelers created a carnival-like atmosphere that had not been seen since the end of lockdowns, and authorities initially tolerated the display, acknowledging it as a form of “cultural exchange.”This year, however, any form of “edginess” appears off-limits. Barriers were set up on Julu Road, a popular Halloween spot, and police patrols deterred would-be revelers, effectively halting celebrations.Some partygoers reported being escorted to police stations, where they were asked to remove their costumes before being allowed to leave. Videos show that police focused their actions on people wearing costumes, while those in everyday clothing were left unbothered.China’s tightening stance on Halloween can be seen as part of a broader skepticism toward Western cultural traditions, which the government often frames as a potential threat to Chinese social values. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) under President Xi Jinping has intensified its focus on promoting Chinese culture, criticizing foreign festivals as “overly passionate” distractions. Chinese state media, in particular, has been vocal in recent years about resisting Western influence, and Halloween, with its American origins, has become a particular target.Some scholars, such as Alfred Wu of the National University of Singapore, argue that the government is attempting to reshape Chinese society by stifling gatherings that may incite social discontent. Wu remarked, “The authorities are far more prepared this year,” citing the likely intention to prevent any repeat of last year’s protest-like festivities.(With inputs from agencies)","Chinese authorities are targeting revelers in Shanghai dressed in Halloween costumes.
