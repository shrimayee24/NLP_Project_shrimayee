Last month was India’s hottest May in 36 years: IMD,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/last-month-was-indias-hottest-may-in-36-years-imd/articleshow/110827479.cms,"As India voted to elect its MPs to the 18th Lok Sabha over the past six weeks, sweltering heat blanketed large swathes of the country. May 2024 was the hottest May in 36 years, shows India Meteorological Department ( IMD ) data.Both April and May this year recorded high maximum temperatures and broke records across multiple stations. The average maximum April temperature this year across India was 35.6°C.This was higher than those observed in the election years of 2004 (35°C), 2009 (35.5°C) and 2014 (35.3°C), but slightly lower than the record 35.7°C observed in 2019.The average maximum temperature this May was 37.3°C, the hottest since May 1988, when the average maximum temperature was 37.4°C. IMD data shows many stations broke past records in May.On May 31, Alwar reported 46.5°C, its fourth-highest temperature. The same day, Bilaspur logged 46.8°C, its fifth-highest May maximum ever, while Bulandshahr saw 46°C, its second-highest May maximum ever.Even the hill station Dehradun experienced 43.2°C recently, its third-highest May maximum temperature on record, as per IMD.Regions towards south India experienced intense heat during initial summer, but later in the season, the unbearable heat was felt more in the north.Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, the director general of meteorology at IMD, explained: “During early summer (March to April), regions like Maharashtra, Gujarat and southern peninsular areas experience higher temperatures because the sun’s position is more directly overhead, providing intense solar radiation as it moves northward.By late summer (May to June), the sun is nearly directly over northern India, causing these regions to heat up significantly.” He added that IMD’s monthly forecasts had already predicted day temperatures to be above normal for most parts of the country Political analyst Vivek Singh Bagri told TOI, “High temperatures are a big factor in influencing voter turnout, as seen this time, causing a dip. Electors in the upper-middle class to middle class categories often tend to skip voting during extreme temperature conditions, whether heat or cold. Many parts of the country recorded over 40-45°C during April as well as in May. However, there are other factors that may have had a role to play too.”Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, the director general of meteorology at IMD, explained: “During early summer (March to April), regions like Maharashtra, Gujarat and southern peninsular areas experience higher temperatures because the sun’s position is more directly overhead, providing intense solar radiation as it moves northward.

Inequality declined between 2011-12 & 2022-23: Government data,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/inequality-declined-between-2011-12-2022-23-government-data/articleshow/110826780.cms,"NEW DELHI: Inequality has reduced both in urban and rural areas across the country between 2011-12 and 2022-23, results of the Household Consumption Expenditure survey have shown.The latest data is expected to add to the raging debate over the extent of inequality in the country with some experts saying it had increased while others have said that it has shown a decline after a spike during the Covid-19 pandemic period.The Gini coefficient , a statistical measure of inequality in the population, shows a decline, from 0.283 to 0.266 for the rural sector and from 0.363 to 0.314 for the urban sector of the country, according to the survey results.“A decline in the Gini coefficient across urban and rural areas suggests a reduction in income inequality between 2011-12 and 2022-23. Remarkably, income inequality has decreased both in industrially advanced states and in states that have not performed well in attracting businesses,” said Nilanjan Banik, professor of economics at Mahindra University.The NSSO had earlier released a fact sheet on the household consumption expenditure data. While commenting on those numbers, Niti Aayog CEO B V R Subrahmanyam had said that based on the household consumption survey data the poverty level in the country could be closer to 5% or less.The household consumption expenditure survey has been released after more than 10 years as the one in 2017-18 was put on the backburner due to inconsistencies in the data. The survey results are used to extrapolate poverty estimates, update GDP numbers.“The survey reveals that the share of consumption at the bottom 50% fractile classes expanded faster in urban areas during FY12 and FY23 including those at the lowest pyramid at 0-5%. In rural areas, there was also a concomitant shift though the pace was slower. There is also a pronounced decline in estimated Gini coefficient in rural and urban areas over the period. Interestingly, across states for rural areas, the estimated Gini coefficient is higher than all India for states like Kerala, Maharashtra and Rajasthan. For urban areas, Haryana and Kerala have higher Gini coefficient than all India. Thus states seem to be doing better on an average in terms of distribution across rural and urban areas,” said Soumya Kanti Ghosh, group chief economic adviser at State Bank of India.The results also showed the Gini coefficient for various states for both urban and rural areas. The survey for 2022-23 has undergone some changes in terms of coverage of items, change in questionnaire, multiple visits for data collection and mode of data collection which has prompted some experts to raise issues linked to comparing the results of the current survey with the previous ones.The average estimated monthly per capita consumption expenditure (MPCE) in 2022-23 was Rs 3,773 in rural and Rs 6,459 in urban India.“Thus, the per capita expenditure level in the urban areas, in nominal terms, and ignoring rural-urban differences in price levels, has been about 71% more than that in the rural areas,” according to the survey.Among the major states, MPCE is the lowest in Chhattisgarh for rural (Rs 2,466) as well as urban (Rs 4,483) sectors. It is the highest in Kerala (Rs 5,924) in rural areas and Telangana (Rs 8,158) in urban areas. Separate surveys conducted by independent think tanks have shown a decline in inequality.“India’s income inequality declined in 2022-23 for the first time since the pandemic, with the income Gini index decreasing by 23%, from 0.506 to 0.390. This improvement is primarily due to the significant recovery of the bottom 50% of households which include labourers, petty traders, small business owners, and small and marginal farmers, according to our ICE 360 survey,” said Rajesh Shukla, MD and CEO of PRICE, a private economic think tank. “Their share of total household income rose from 15.8% in 2020-21 to 22% in 2022-23. Govt welfare schemes introduced in response to the pandemic significantly contributed to the decrease in income inequality,” said Shukla.","Household consumption expenditure survey has been released after more than 10 years. The survey results are used to extrapolate poverty estimates, update GDP numbers. The average estimated monthly per capita consumption expenditure (MPCE) in 2022-23 was Rs 3,773 in rural and Rs 6,459 in urban India.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110827242,imgsize-31322,width-400,resizemode-4/110827242.jpg"

67 students scoring a perfect 720 in NEET-UG 2024 raises doubts; six have seat numbers from same sequence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/67-students-scoring-a-perfect-720-in-neet-ug-2024-raises-doubts-six-have-seat-numbers-from-same-sequence/articleshow/110752235.cms,"MUMBAI: The NEET-UG 2024 results, announced on Tuesday, have taken several students by surprise. A day after, students and parents have raised objections over an unprecedented numbers of students, 67, bagging the perfect score - 720 out of 720 - also other discrepancies in the statement issued by the agency.Of the total students bagging full marks, six have seat numbers from the same sequence and are from Haryana, indicating the chance of them being from a same centre.Parents, in letters to the National Testing Agency ( NTA ), are seeking a thorough investigation into the alleged discrepancies in the results before the counselling commences.Scorecards of students scoring 718 and 719 are also being circulated on social media, which parents claim is impossible to achieve in the paper, when each NEET question carries four marks and one mark each is given for negative marking.The NTA, in a statement, said that they received few representations and court cases from NEET candidates raising concerns of loss of time during the exam held on May 5.""Such cases/representations were considered by NTA and the normalisation formula, which has been devised and adopted by the apex court in a judgement from 2018, to address the loss of time faced by candidates. The loss of time was ascertained and such candidates were compensated with grace marks. So their marks can be 718 or 719 too,"" said the statement.Parent representative Ruiee Kapoor said that the explanation provided by the NTA is not satisfactory as a score of 718 or 719 is technically improbable. ""Also 67 students scoring full marks is unprecedented in NEET-UG and highly unusual. There is also bunching of students with higher marks, which has led to a major discrepancy in the marks and their corresponding marks. At the same scores, the corresponding ranks have gone up by three to four times. While the overall cut-off has also risen from 137 to 164, students even with 720 marks will find it difficult to get a seat in AIIMS Delhi-a sought-after institute,"" said Kapoor, adding that MBBS admissions closed at rank 57 in the open merit last year in the institute.An NTA official said that more students scored higher marks due to the normalisation process and also because the physics and chemistry sections were relatively easier and as per NCERT books. This was done to address equity and also to discourage coaching mafia, said the official.Another parent claimed that the provision of grace marks due to waste of time should have been specified in the information brochure, as students could have utilised it in the past. Sachin Bangad, a parent representative, said, the exam was ""managed"".""How is that six students who scored full 720 marks are from the same exam centre in Faridabad, Haryana,"" he asked. A senior NTA official reasoned this to the fact that in this particular exam centre in Haryana, ""there was incorrect distribution of papers and they lost 45 minutes. When it was corrected, a formula as per previous court order was used in a few cities including this.""Experts including faculty doctors have demanded an explanation of the normalization criteria of NEET results at how many centers was the normalization applied. Parents said the significantly high cut-off have put off many candidates who were aspiring for joining government medical colleges.""Students scoring less than 660 marks now have a very poor chance of securing admission to government medical colleges,"" said Bangad. This is in contrast to the previous year, where students with 600 marks were able to secure seats in government colleges.","Parents are seeking a thorough investigation into the alleged discrepancies in the results. Of the total students bagging full marks, six have seat numbers from the same sequence and are from Haryana. scorecards of students scoring 718 and 719 are also being circulated on social media.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110752230,imgsize-42520,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/110752230.jpg"

After effects of Porsche mishap: 47 bars face temporary suspension of licenses while 25 pay fines for breaching norms,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-effects-of-porsche-mishap-47-bars-face-temporary-suspension-of-licenses-while-25-pay-fines-for-breaching-norms/articleshow/110825507.cms,"MUMBAI: In an aftershock of the porsche mishap in Pune that killed two young students by a drunk minor, around 47 bars across Mumbai metropolitan region will remained closed for 5 to 10 days as a punishment for not following closure timings, for offering liquor to underage patrons, and for not issuing a day's drinking permit to them. This is because their licenses have been suspended as punishment for the next few days as a mark of punishment.It may be mentioned here that post incident the state excise commissioner Vijay Suryawanshi has issued stringent directives to all the bars and liquor shops across the state to install CCTVs in such a way that their entrances and counters could be monitored real time for underage customers and closure timings by the state excise officials. ""We do not have enough staff to monitor each license holder everyday and hence the move,"" he pointed out while speaking to TOI.According to senior excise officials out of 47 suspensions in the metropolitan region majority (around 30 to 32) have been found breaching closure timing which is 1.30 am as most of them were found accepting delayed customers and orders and thus delaying closing of their bar premises. Most of the offenders are from Thane and suburban Mumbai. These are besides 25 bars against whom penal action was taken (penalty ranges from Rs 1000 to Rs 50000 depending upon number of offences).Similarly, around 13 bars were found to be issuing liquor without giving them a day's drinking permit (paltry Rs 5 to be paid on the spot) followed by 5 cases wherein the liquor was sold or offered across the counter to the underage customers. To drink wine or beer, the permitted drinking age is 21 while for hard liquor such as rum or whisky the age should be 25. ""The punishment to temporarily suspend licenses has come in after giving the bar owners proper hearing by the excise, the collector and police authorities,"" said excise officials.","47 bars across Mumbai metropolitan region will remained closed for 5 to 10 days as a punishment for not following closure timings, for offering liquor to underage patrons, and for not issuing a day's drinking permit to them.

The party won all the 21 assembly and two Parliament seats it contested, marking a 100% success rate.Pawan Kalyan , who faced a tough defeat in the 2019 elections, worked tirelessly to make a comeback.Despite heavy criticism for his losses in Bhimavaram and Gajuwaka assembly constituencies, he remained steadfast in his political efforts.His persistence paid off in the 2024 elections with a grand success.In 2021, Pawan proposed an alliance with a mission to unite all opposition parties to defeat YS Jagan Mohan Reddy. He played a crucial role in bringing the TDP back into the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). Pawan conceded three assembly seats , limiting his party to 21, to solidify the alliance.Running on the slogan ‘Hello AP Bye Bye YCP,’ Pawan’s efforts aimed for a 90% strike rate, which ultimately resulted in a perfect100% strike rate .Speaking to media after the celebrations at the party headquarters in Mangalagiri, Pawan said, “It is a historic day for AP. I never tasted success in my life. My life is filled with struggles and failures. Victory in 21/21 assembly and 2/2 LS seats with 100% strike rate made me proud. We are the only party in the country to achieve this feat. Five crore people of AP wished for change and gave us a chance.

Let’s talk Periyar,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/lets-talk-periyar/articleshow/110830424.cms,"Under the shade of trees at Anna Nagar Tower Park , amid the sounds of swings, seesaws, and brisk-walking seniors, the Ambedkar Reading Circle (ARC), Chennai Chapter, gathers once every month.The reading circle comprises youngsters who gather to discuss the works and ideologies of political leader B R Ambedkar, social reformer Periyar , and anti-caste activist Ayothidasar.Joy Andrew, co-organiser of ARC Chennai, says the circle started from a personal experience. “Last year, my brother and his friends struggled to find housing in Bengaluru because of caste biases. It highlighted the persistence of casteism in urban areas. In April last year, they began organising discussions at Cubbon Park on the works of Ambedkar and Periyar to bring the issues they face to the fore. I decided to bring their movement to Chennai,” Joy says.ARC Chennai held its inaugural event last year on Nov 26, Constitution Day, by holding a mass reading of the Constitution. The event attracted a diverse crowd, from college students to senior citizens. “We aim to build a democratic space, where people can speak out,” says Joy. “Holding these events in a public park allows anyone to join in.”ARC has hosted discussions in the park on topics ranging from the need for a Constitution, a tribute to Ayothidasar, who fought to help dalits, todas, and other hill tribes achieve ‘adi tamilar’ status in the govt; and Ambedkar’s speeches on Buddhism.To celebrate Valentine’s Day, the circle had also read letters Ambedkar wrote to his wife Ramabai.“I feel seen and understood in the circle because there are several occasions when I have faced discrimina tion,” says Mathesh Ravi, a dalit psychology student. “At an internship I once did, fellow psychologists and peers would mock my music preferences because I enjoy listening to parai. They would belittle the music and me and say I liked it only because of my caste. Calling them out didn’t stop the harassment. At ARC I got a chance to speak about it with people who understood what I was going through.”Priya, a Chennai-based researcher at King’s College, London, says it is important to have a safe space in a metropolitan city to discuss shared ideologies and experiences. “We are often socially isolated, perhaps because we work from home or because we are away from family and friends or maybe because we have moved from a village to a city. This circle acts as a forum to bring people to gether and expose them to new perspectives and ideologies,” she says.In July, the circle plans to combine art and the literary works of Ambedkar through a cyanotype workshop. The workshop will be held at the park for 30 participants on a first-come, first-serve basis free of cost through online registration. “We have also mobilised college students as ambassadors to invite new members. We’re also looking at working with schools to encourage students to read Ambedkar and Periyar,” he says.","The Ambedkar Reading Circle (ARC), Chennai Chapter, gathers once every month.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.",Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations. These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class. The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

This mission marks a historic milestone as Williams becomes the first woman to pilot and test a new crewed spacecraft on its maiden voyage.Upon arrival, Williams celebrated her third trip to the ISS with a joyful dance, a gesture of her excitement and happiness. She was warmly welcomed by the seven astronauts aboard the station, who greeted her and Wilmore with the traditional ringing of a bell. Describing the crew as ""another family,"" Williams expressed her gratitude for the warm reception.After launching from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida, the spacecraft docked with the ISS 26 hours later, despite a one-hour delay due to minor technical issues such as helium leaks. The mission's primary objective was to validate the Boeing Starliner as a viable alternative to the SpaceX Crew Module for ferrying astronauts under NASA's commercial crew program.The astronauts monitored the Starliner as it autonomously navigated a series of maneuvers to dock with the ISS. They also completed crucial tests, including manually flying the spacecraft for the first time in space. During their week-long stay, Williams and Wilmore will assist with tests and conduct scientific experiments.Reflecting on the mission, Williams said, ""It feels like going back home."" She is known for previously carrying an idol of Lord Ganesh and the Bhagavad Gita to space. Before liftoff, Williams, who helped design the Starliner, admitted to some pre-launch nerves but expressed excitement about the spacecraft she had named ""Calypso"" after the ship of the famed French oceanographer Jacques-Yves Cousteau.The astronauts' return journey will conclude with a landing on solid ground, unlike previous missions that ended with ocean landings.","The Boeing Starliner successfully docked with the International Space Station ( ISS ) on Thursday.

"Rio Grande: After 34 million years, scientists discover Antarctica's lost river",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/rio-grande-after-34-million-years-scientists-discover-antarcticas-lost-river/articleshow/110775221.cms,"A recently discovered ancient river in Antarctica , referred to as the Rio Grande , is providing new insights into the continent's climatic history. This groundbreaking find is crucial for understanding how climate change has shaped the landscape over millions of years.The discovery was made by a team of scientists from the University of Arizona , led by geoscientist Dr Stewart Jamieson. ""The Rio Grande is unlike anything we have seen in Antarctica,"" Dr Jamieson said. ""This river system was buried under ice for millions of years and offers a unique window into the past.""The Rio Grande, which rivals some of the world's largest rivers, was identified through satellite imagery and radar data. The river's channels stretch over 680 miles, and it likely played a significant role in transporting water and sediment across the continent during a warmer period in Earth's history, a Newsweek report.The presence of the Rio Grande suggests that Antarctica once had a much milder climate, with conditions that could support flowing water. This finding challenges previous assumptions about the continent's glacial history and indicates that parts of Antarctica may have been ice-free during certain periods.""The implications of this discovery are profound,"" said Dr Jamieson. ""It changes our understanding of the Antarctic ice sheet and its stability. Knowing that such a large river system existed implies that the ice sheet was much smaller than we thought.""The research team plans to conduct further studies to determine the age of the river system and the climatic conditions that allowed it to form. These investigations could provide valuable data for predicting future changes in the Antarctic ice sheet in response toglobal warming .The discovery of the Rio Grande also raises questions about the potential for similar hidden river systems in other parts of Antarctica. ""We are just scratching the surface,"" Dr Jamieson noted. ""There could be other river systems buried beneath the ice, waiting to be discovered.""As climate change continues to impact the polar regions, understanding the history of Antarctica's ice and water systems becomes increasingly important. The findings from the Rio Grande will help scientists develop more accurate models of ice sheet dynamics and sea-level rise.This discovery highlights the importance of continued exploration and research in Antarctica. It underscores the need for international collaboration to uncover the secrets of this remote and largely unexplored continent.","The discovery was made by a team of scientists from the University of Arizona.

His arrival was meant to address financial struggles and a significant drop in digital readership since 2020.Recently, Lewis implemented a restructuring plan at the Post, which led to the exit of Sally Buzbee , the top news executive, who had led the newsroom for three years. Buzbee has not commented on her departure.According to The New York Times, Lewis advised Buzbee not to cover a development in Prince Harry's litigation related to the phone hacking scandal. Allegations in the civil case suggest that Lewis played a role in concealing the scandal by destroying evidence, which he denies. The Post later published the story, and Lewis has denied pressuring Buzbee not to run it.NPR media reporter David Folkenflik reported that Lewis, prior to joining the Post, offered an exclusive interview in exchange for Folkenflik dropping a story about his involvement in the phone hacking case. Lewis dismissed Folkenflik as an activist, insisting their conversation was off-the-record. Folkenflik refuted this, stating the offer was not off-the-record and emphasizing the importance of his reporting.In a Friday email to staff, Lewis admitted a need to improve communication and invited them to discussions on his restructuring plan, acknowledging lost trust and urging a fresh start.Lewis, who began his career in British journalism , adopted a more aggressive reporting style. He has hired Robert Winnett, a former colleague from the Daily Telegraph, where they notably uncovered an MP expense scandal through paid-for records—an approach typically unacceptable in American journalism.Despite concerns about the restructuring, Lewis emphasized the necessity for swift action, citing declining readership.

On Friday, temperatures continued to soar past 110 degrees Fahrenheit (43 degrees Celsius) from California to Arizona , following a day of unprecedented heat.Although summer is still two weeks away, about half of Arizona and Nevada were under an excessive heat alert, which the National Weather Service extended through Friday evening. In Las Vegas , where it has never been this hot so early in the year, the alert was extended through Saturday.Temperatures are expected to gradually decrease over the weekend but will remain above average into early next week.Las Vegas set a new record of 111 F (43.8 C) on Thursday, matching the earliest point in the year that the city has reached 110 F (43.3 C). On Friday afternoon, temperatures in Las Vegas climbed to 110 F (48.3 C), breaking another record set in 2013. The National Weather Service warned that it could get even hotter before sunset.In Phoenix, a new record high of 113 F (45 C) on Thursday surpassed the previous record of 111 F (44 C) set in 2016. Forecasters described the conditions as “dangerously hot.”Eleanor Wallace, a 9-year-old visiting Phoenix from northern Utah to celebrate her birthday with a hike, remarked on the intense heat, saying, “It’s so hot.”There have been no immediate reports of heat-related deaths or serious injuries. However, at a campaign rally for presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump in Phoenix on Thursday, 11 people were hospitalized for heat exhaustion. Trump is scheduled to hold another rally in Las Vegas on Sunday, where the high is expected to reach 104 F (40 C).The National Weather Service predicts slight cooling across the region this weekend, but temperatures in central and southern Arizona and parts of southern Nevada will still hit triple digits, possibly reaching up to 110 F (43 C).Other areas also saw record-breaking heat on Thursday, including Death Valley National Park, where temperatures hit a record 122 F (50 C), surpassing the previous record of 121 F (49.4 C) set in 1996. Records at Death Valley date back to 1911.The heat wave arrived earlier than usual, even in higher-elevation areas typically cooler by about a dozen degrees. Reno, for instance, recorded a high of 98 F (37 C) on Thursday, well above the normal high of 81 F (27 C) for this time of year.

New York governor defends blocking plan that would toll Manhattan drivers to pay for subway repairs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/new-york-governor-defends-blocking-plan-that-would-toll-manhattan-drivers-to-pay-for-subway-repairs/articleshow/110811659.cms,"ALBANY: New York governor Kathy Hochul on Friday defended her decision to block a plan to reduce New York City traffic and raise billions for its ailing subway system through a new toll on Manhattan drivers - but offered little detail on how she would replace the program's financial and environmental benefits.In her first public appearance since announcing she was indefinitely pausing the "" congestion pricing "" toll, Hochul maintained the move was driven by economics and conversations with New Yorkers, particularly people at a Manhattan diner she frequents.""I can't do anything right at this time that would also suck the vitality out of this city when we're still fighting for our comeback,"" she told reporters at a news conference announced four minutes before it was set to start Friday night in Albany.Hochul this week suggested raising taxes on businesses to make up for the toll revenue. The proposal immediately sparked criticism that higher taxes would hurt the city's ongoing rebound from COVID-19 and run counter to her rationale for halting the program. Lawmakers eventually rejected the tax hike plan.The governor, who released a pre-recorded video statement on Wednesday pausing the program, had previously been a staunch advocate for the toll and had described it as ""transformative"" as of about two weeks ago.The program was set to begin June 30. It was signed into law by former Gov. Andrew Cuomo in 2019 following years of work from transit and environmental advocates who argued it would result in better public transitand cleaner air in the city. Drivers entering the core of Manhattan would have had to pay a toll of about $15, depending on vehicle type.The Metropolitan Transportation Authority , which would oversee the plan, has already installed cameras, sensors and license plate readers for the program, and reached a contract worth more than $500 million with a private vendor to operate the tolling infrastructure, according to the New York City Independent Budget Office.Overall, revenues from congestion pricing were expected to reach $1 billion per year and finance $15 billion in capital projects for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, many of which are desperately needed upgrades to the city's beleaguered subways.It was not clear from Hochul's remarks how she planned to replace that money. But she told reporters, ""We gave a lot of thought to this.""""No one should question my commitment or the leaders' commitment to ensure that these projects are properly funded,"" the governor said.State lawmakers are set to end their legislative session Friday and do not appear poised to take up legislation to replace the congestion pricing revenue.""Derailing this important program at the last possible moment and asking the legislature to come up with an alternative funding mechanism in less than 48 hours is irresponsible and inconsistent with principles of good governance,"" said Senate Deputy Leader Michael Gianaris, a DemocratHochul, at her news conference, said she had the legal authority to halt the law without the approval of the MTA board, saying ""it's not necessary for them to take action"" because she was pausing the plan, not terminating it. She did not make clear if or when she would potentially reinstate the program.Some board members have said they were not briefed before the governor's announcement and were confused about how certain projects would now be funded with the toll on pause.""This was not waking up one day and saying 'let's do this,' "" Hochul said.

WASHIGTON: William Anders , the astronaut who captured the iconic ""Earthrise"" photograph during the historic Apollo 8 mission, died in a plane crash on Friday at the age of 90, according to his family.Anders was piloting a small aircraft when it went down off the coast of Washington state on Friday morning. His son confirmed to US media that Anders was the sole occupant of the plane. Sheriff Eric Peter stated that search teams were combing the crash site, but no body had been recovered at the time of the report.Anders gained global recognition as part of the Apollo 8 mission in December 1968. He, along with Frank Borman and James Lovell, became one of the first humans to orbit the Moon, completing ten laps around the lunar surface without landing.During one of these orbits, Anders took the ""Earthrise"" photo, which famously shows the Earth rising over the Moon's horizon. The image has been hailed as one of the most significant photographs in history and was featured in Life Magazine's ""100 Photographs that Changed The World."" An original print of the photograph fetched 11,800 euros at a Copenhagen auction in 2022.Nasa Administrator Bill Nelson honored Anders' legacy on social media platform X, stating, ""In 1968, during Apollo 8, Bill Anders offered to humanity among the deepest of gifts an astronaut can give. He traveled to the threshold of the Moon and helped all of us see something else: ourselves. He embodied the lessons and the purpose of exploration. We will miss him.""Born on October 17, 1933, in Hong Kong, Anders graduated from the US Naval Academy and later earned a master's degree in nuclear engineering. After his illustrious career as an astronaut, Anders held several significant government roles, including serving as the first chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and as the US ambassador to Norway.

Nepal Parliament approves ratification for framework agreement related to International Solar Alliance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/nepal-parliament-approves-ratification-for-framework-agreement-related-to-international-solar-alliance/articleshow/110819158.cms,"File Photo (Picture Credit: ANI)

KATHMANDU: Nepal's House of Representatives has passed a proposal seeking ratification of a framework agreement related to the membership of the International Solar Alliance that will help the Himalayan nation increase usage of solar power in its effort to combat the impact due to changing climate. The House of Representatives (HoR), or the Lower House on Thursday endorsed the proposal tabled by minister for energy, water resources and irrigation, Shakti Bahadur Basnet through a majority vote.

The International Solar Alliance (ISA) was conceived as a joint effort by India and France to mobilise efforts against climate change through the deployment of solar energy solutions and announced on the sidelines of the 21st Conference of Parties (COP21) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) at Paris in 2015.

With the amendment of its Framework Agreement in 2020, all member states of the United Nations are eligible to join the ISA. At present, 119 countries, including Nepal, are signatories to the ISA Framework Agreement, of which 98 countries have submitted the necessary instruments of ratification to become full members of the ISA.

Responding to queries raised by lawmakers from various political parties, Basnet said that the agreement was tabled in keeping with the national interest of the country as clean energy is essential for minimising the impacts of climate change.

""The installation of solar energy will be important for Nepal's development,"" he pointed out and informed the House that the government has already moved the process for the generation of 1,000 MW through solar power in the next couple of years.

A competitive bidding for Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) has already started for the same and bidding for PPA of 800 MW has already opened, he added.

Rajendra Khatrichhetri, a lawmaker belonging to opposition Nepali Congress, welcomed the government's move as he said, ""This is a good proposal as it will provide cheap and affordable energy to the general public and also helps to minimise the impacts of climate change.""

Currently, Nepal has 13 projects generating 68.38 MW of solar power, according to Nepal's Energy Development Department. In September 2023, Nepal announced that it plans to develop 30,000 MW of electricity by 2035 and would club hydropower and solar power.","Nepal's House of Representatives has passed a proposal seeking ratification of a framework agreement related to the International Solar Alliance.
