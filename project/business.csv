HC judges and CJs fearful of SC Collegium

NEW DELHI: In seeking an Allahabad HC judge’s personal explanation, the Supreme Court Collegium appears to have stepped around the mechanism prescribed in memorandum of procedure to deal with errant judges and impermissibly assumed supervisory powers over the High Courts.Was the judge obliged to appear before the Collegium on Tuesday to tender his personal explanation for his controversial speech at a VHP event on Dec 8? TOI spoke to a cross-section of judges in different High Courts who said that he had no option but to appear before the Collegium, which could have taken serious view of his failure to respond to the summons and transferred him to another far-off HC as a punitive measure.Ex-CJIs told TOI that the memorandum of procedure (MoP) specifies that in case of an errant HC judge, the CJI could speak with the concerned HC chief justice and request him to counsel the concerned judge. If the devious behaviour is non-condonable, then the CJI can seek a report from the HC CJ on the matter.Once the CJ, after talking to the judge in question, gives the report, the CJI can seek the opinion of a senior judge outside the Collegium on whether the issue requires an in-house inquiry. Thereafter the CJ’s report and the SC judge’s opinion is placed before the Collegium to take a call on whether an in-house inquiry committee is to be set up.The HC judges were unanimous that though the High Courts are constitutionally distinct and independent entities, the SC Collegium, which has the power to recommend transfer of CH judges and CJs as well as select Judges and CJs for elevation to the SC, has over the years assumed the role of ‘super boss’ in judiciary.The recurring theme of refrain of HC judges was – “power to recommend transfers of HC judges and chief justices has been weaponized to make the HC judges dare not act independent of the views of the CJI-led Collegium. The allurement of getting elevated to the SC, which gives a judge three more years at a more powerful constitutional post, has made the CJs agree to the wishes of the CJI and Collegium.”They said the fact that HCs are not subordinate to the SC has been accepted repeatedly by the SC in its judgments and that is the reason why the SC even on the judicial side cannot direct a HC to decide a case within a specified time frame.The high courts have a pendency of nearly 62 lakh cases with an existing strength of 1114 judges, which works out to 5547 cases per judge. The SC with a working strength of 33 judges has a pendency of over 82,000 cases, working out to 2494 cases per judge. In addition, each HC judge supervises the working of the district courts and guides meaningful work of the district legal services authority.While the HC’s can direct the district judiciary, also referred till recently as subordinate judiciary, the SC cannot do so for the HCs. The HC judges wonder as to whether the SC Collegium could take similar action if the person happens to be a SC judge.Every CJI comes with his own ideas about reforming the justice delivery system, the HC judges said, adding that the CJs of HCs, who are from outside the concerned state, being on the verge of either getting considered for appointment to the SC or retirement, agree unhesitatingly to the CJI’s proposals for reforms without realizing that states with diverse socio-economic conditions need different approach for reducing litigation.","The Supreme Court Collegium appears to have stepped around the mechanism prescribed in memorandum of procedure to deal with errant judges. The High Courts are constitutionally distinct and independent entities.

The footage showed the Navy boat racing towards the ferry, attempting a sharp turn before ultimately crashing into it.The incident, occurred around 3:55pm near Butcher Island, left 101 passengers rescued, while several others were hospitalised with injuries. The ferry was en route from the Gateway of India to Elephanta Caves, carrying around 110 passengers, including 20 children.Also read: Man from speedboat flung into air, landed on ferry’s deck The Indian Navy, Coast Guard, and police deployed 11 vessels and four helicopters for the rescue operation. Navy officials confirmed that four of the six crew members aboard the speedboat had died, with one critically injured.Witness accounts from survivors painted a harrowing picture of the chaos that unfolded. Gautam Gupta, 25, who filmed the viral video of the speedboat moments before the crash, told TOI, “I was recording the video of a speedboat presuming it was doing stunts when it suddenly hit our ferry. To my disbelief, one of its passengers was flung into the air and landed on our deck, lifeless and badly mutilated.”Also read: How navy speedboat rammed into Mumbai ferry leaving at least 13 dead Gupta, who is currently undergoing treatment at St George's Hospital alongside his cousin, said their aunt remains missing. “We were on our way to Elephanta Caves when the tragedy struck.

Everyone scrambled for life jackets on their own,” he added.Ram Milan Singh, 41, a passenger from Bengaluru, described the terrifying moments before the ferry submerged. “Water started rushing in, forcing people to rush to the upper deck. The boat tilted, and many lost their footing. I jumped into the sea, thinking it was my only chance to survive,” he said. Singh and his brother-in-law were rescued, but his two colleagues remain missing.In response to the tragedy, Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis announced an ex-gratia payment of Rs 5 lakh for the families of the deceased. “This is a deeply unfortunate incident.

ABU DHABI: Indian art has taken centre stage at Louvre Abu Dhabi , the Arab world's largest art museum, with highlights such as a Chola-era bronze idol of Jina and Sayed Haider Raza 's Bindu. Since its opening in 2017, the museum has showcased how trade and artistic exchanges connected India with the rest of the world.Ann Sasidharan, operations team leader at the museum, said India's influence spans centuries. ""During the 1500s, trade routes through India shaped global navigation and art. Even under East India Company rule, Indian artists preserved their originality,"" she told TOI.She said the collection illustrates India's role in the diffusion of religious art, particularly between 5th and 15th centuries. Sculptures like Buddha heads from Kushan Empire (100-300 CE), which included parts of present-day Pakistan, and copper tribhanga Buddhas from Malla dynasty, present-day Nepal, sit alongside Chinese depictions of Guanyin from Northern Song Dynasty, highlighting a shared spiritual heritage.With over 1,000 artworks from across the globe, Louvre Abu Dhabi attracted 1.2 million visitors in 2023, and Indians were among the top three international audiences. The museum's focus on cross-cultural understanding is also bringing contemporary Indian culture into the spotlight, exemplified by last year's exhibition 'Bollywood Superstars: A Short Story of Indian Cinema'.","Louvre Abu Dhabi is the Arab world's largest art museum.

He said Kumbh has historically served as a centre for the exchange of ideas, a confluence of scholars, and a unifying force for Sanatani powers, playing a pivotal role in shaping the country's condition and direction alongside its religious authority.He also emphasised that Kumbh has been organised even during challenging eras, including the Mughal and British rule and under govts indifferent to Sanatan values.However, the 2019 Kumbh was a turning point, as it showcased the true and eternal essence of Sanatan to the world for the first time. Maha Kumbh 2025 would surpass past achievements and set new benchmarks of success.Praising India's balanced ""India First"" foreign policy in crises like the Russia-Ukraine war and Israel-Palestine conflict, he said this approach solidified India's position as a global power and a beacon of Sanatan and humanity.","Acharya Mahamandaleshwar Swami Avdheshanand Giri praised the preparations for Maha Kumbh under CM's leadership.

6-point consensus



Positively evaluated the resolution in eastern Ladakh and agreed to work for peace on the ground.

Commitment for a fair, reasonable, and mutually acceptable package solution to the border issue.

Strengthen confidence-building measures.

Resume Kailash yatra, river cooperation and border trade.

Strengthen SR, diplomatic and military talks mechanisms.

SRs to meet again in India in 2025.

NEW DELHI: India and China took a significant step forward towards further normalization of ties as the Special Representatives (SRs), NSA Ajit Doval and foreign minister Wang Yi, held talks for the first time under that format in 5 years in Beijing and, according to an Indian readout, positively affirmed the implementation of the October 21 disengagement agreement , resulting in patrolling and grazing in “relevant areas”.Significantly, they discussed ways to ensure peace on the ground so that border issues don’t hold back “normal development’’ of bilateral relations and, according to Beijing, agreed on a “step by step” roadmap, which would entail addressing the easy issues first before moving on to those more contentious, for taking the relationship forward.Chinese ambassador Xu Feihong said the 2 sides reached a 6-point consensus that included resumption of Kailash Mansarovar pilgrimage in Xizang (Tibet), cross-border river cooperation and trade at the Nathu La Pass.China described the “hard-won” talks as constructive, with Wang saying the SR engagement was an important and timely step towards the implementation of the consensus reached by PM Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping in Kazan in October.The Indian government said Doval and Wang also provided “positive directions” for cross-border cooperation and exchanges including resumption of the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra , data sharing on trans-border rivers and border trade.The Indian government said Wang and Doval reiterated the importance of maintaining a “political perspective” of the overall bilateral relationship, while seeking a fair, reasonable and mutually acceptable framework for settlement of the boundary question. They resolved to inject more “vitality” into this process. “They agreed on the salience of stable, predictable and amicable India-China relations for regional and global peace and prosperity,’’ said the government.Doval and Wang also underlined the importance of maintaining peace and tranquillity in the border areas to promote overall development of the India-China bilateral relationship, according to the Indian side.The SR engagement, which last took place in December 2019, followed the October thaw that saw India and China completing the disengagement process at the remaining friction points, Depsang and Demchok, in eastern Ladakh. This was also the first high-level visit from India to China since the eastern Ladakh border standoff that started in May 2020.“Drawing on the learnings from the events of 2020, they discussed various measures to maintain peace and tranquillity on the border and advance effective border management . They decided to use, coordinate and guide the relevant diplomatic and military mechanisms towards this purpose,’’ said the Indian readout. India has said that after disengagement, it’s going to focus on de-escalation and effective management of border activities.Doval also called on Chinese Vice President Han Zheng and invited Wang to India for another round of SR talks.","India and China took a significant step forward towards further normalization of ties as the Special Representatives (SRs), NSA Ajit Doval and foreign minister Wang Yi, held talks for the first time in 5 years in Beijing.

Is coconut oil hair oil or edible oil? Supreme Court solves old puzzle,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/is-coconut-oil-hair-oil-or-edible-oil-supreme-court-solves-old-puzzle/articleshow/116449605.cms,"To oil or boil?

NEW DELHI: A three-judge bench of Supreme Court on Wednesday solved a 20-year-old riddle that plagued levying of excise duty - whether pure coconut oil is to be classified as an edible oil or under cosmetics as hair oil?This question had got a split verdict from the bench of the then CJI and Justice R Banumathi. While Justice Gogoi, who retired as CJI in Nov 2019, was of the view coconut oil in small packaging was appropriately classified as edible oil, Justice Banumathi opined that coconut oil packed in small containers are to be classified as hair oil.A bench of CJI Sanjiv Khanna, and Justices Sanjay Kumar and R Mahadevan, aware of the dual use of coconut oil in different parts of the country, said the classification would depend on the branding of the oil as edible to meet the criteria under food safety regulations, and conform to a different criterion under Drugs and Cosmetics Act to be classified as hair oil.Writing the judgment, Justice Kumar rejected argument of revenue dept that pure coconut oil should invariably be classified as hair oil and said, ""We are of the opinion that pure coconut oil sold in small quantities as 'edible oil' would be classifiable as edible oil"". Revenue dept had said the bunch of appeals involved Rs 160 crore in terms of excise duty, penalties, redemption fine and interest.SC said, ""The fact that such edible coconut oil was sold in smaller containers would not, by itself, be indicative of it being packaging of a kind fit for use as 'hair oil'.""""One may choose to buy one's cooking oil in small quantities, be it for economic or for health reasons or due to inclination to use fresh oil in food preparation, and the smaller size of the packaging of such oil cannot be taken to mean that it is to be used as 'hair oil' without any pointer to that effect, be it by way of a label or literature or by any other indication that it is to be used as 'hair oil',"" it said.""Small-sized containers are common to both 'edible oils' and 'hair oils'. Therefore, there must be something more to distinguish between them for classification of such oil, other than size of the packaging,"" the bench said.","A three-judge bench of Supreme Court on Wednesday solved a 20-year-old riddle that plagued levying of excise duty.

CISF Jawans rescue 56 using pilot boat

Passenger on ferry recounts horror

NEW DELHI: 13 people died, 101 others were rescued after a ferry capsized while en route to Elephanta Island from Mumbai’s iconic Gateway of India, Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis informed on Wednesday.The Neelkamal ferry, was on way to Elephanta Islands, a popular tourist destination near Mumbai, when the speed boat circled it before crashing into it.The incident happened when a naval speed-craft undergoing trials in the sea went out of control and rammed into the ferry. The naval boat’s engine had been recently changed and the new engine was being tested. The engine got stuck in full throttle and the boat went out of control and rammed into the ferry Neelkamal. The naval boat had 6 persons on board including 2 naval personnel and 4 members from the firm which had supplied the engine.According to the reports, the ferry had over 110 people on board including 20 children while the naval boat had six individuals, including two Navy personnel and four staff members.Rescue efforts were launched in coordination between the Indian Navy, Coast Guard, and Marine Police. The operation involves 11 Navy boats, three Marine Police boats, and one Coast Guard vessel actively searching the area. Additionally, four helicopters have been deployed for Search and Rescue (SAR) operations to locate any remaining passengers.Fadnavis said that the ferry capsized after a speed boat, reportedly belonging to either the Navy or the Coast Guard, lost control and collided with it.Fadnavis declared financial assistance of Rs 5 lakh to the kin of victims of the ""extremely unfortunate"" tragedy from the CM's Relief Fund. PM Modi too declared Rs 2 lakh ex-gratia for the kin of victims of the tragedy.CISF jawans rescued 56 individuals after a ferry collided with a Navy craft off the Mumbai coast on Wednesday. The CISF said that its personnel reached the accident site, near Butcher Island—approximately 6 km from the Jawaharlal Nehru Port (JNPA)—using a patrolling boat.The CISF’s patrolling boat and the pilot boat SHM-XXIII rescued 56 individuals, who were then transported to the JNPA landing jetty.Despite the accident site being beyond JNPA’s regular patrolling limits, CISF boats were immediately dispatched upon receiving information from Port Control. “All possible assistance was provided at the JNPA landing jetty to ensure the safe transfer of passengers needing medical care to JNPA Hospital,” the CISF statement added.When 45-year-old Ganesh spotted a speedboat-like craft rushing toward the ferry he was standing on, a chilling thought crossed his mind: the inevitable was about to happen—and it did.“The boat, which later turned out to be a naval craft, was moving in circles in the Arabian Sea, while our ferry was on its way to Elephanta Island, a popular tourist attraction near Mumbai. I had boarded the ferry around 3:30 pm,” Ganesh told PTI.“There was a brief thought in my mind that the naval craft could hit our boat, and it happened within the next few seconds,” said Ganesh, who was standing on the deck of the ill-fated Neel Kamal ferry.The eyewitness, a Hyderabad native, was among the first of the 99 passengers rescued after the collision. He noted that there were over 100 passengers, including children, on board the ferry at the time of the accident.","13 people died, 101 others were rescued after a ferry capsized while en route to Elephanta Island from Mumbai’s iconic Gateway of India.

AAP promise: Free medical treatment for 60+ in Delhi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/aap-promise-free-medical-treatment-for-60-in-delhi/articleshow/116450796.cms,"Valid voter I-card of Delhi sole criterion: Kejriwal

NEW DELHI: Eyeing the upcoming assembly polls, AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal promised to provide free treatment to all Delhiites aged above 60 years at both state-run and private health facilities if re-elected in polls due in Feb next year.Announcing the proposed 'Sanjeevani' scheme, Kejriwal said AAP volunteers would start visiting every household within two-three weeks to complete the ""registration"" and provide every eligible person with a card. ""Keep the card issued by AAP volunteers safe. The scheme will be approved as soon as AAP forms the govt after the elections,"" Kejriwal said.Sources said the scheme was announced as a counter to the Centre's Ayushman Bharat PM Jan Arogya Yojana, which was expanded in Sept this year to cover all senior citizens aged 70 and above.The AB PM-JAY provides free health insurance coverage of up to Rs 5 lakh, regardless of the beneficiary's income. Delhi and West Bengal are the only two states in the country that have not implemented the AB PM-JAY scheme so far.After the Delhi HC issued a notice to the Delhi govt regarding implementation of the Ayushman Bharat scheme last month, CM Atishi said that her govt was ready to implement it, but there were contradictions between the facilities offered by the GNCTD and those under Ayushman Bharat. She added that the health department was directed to devise a mechanism to incorporate the benefits of the Ayushman Bharat scheme without withdrawing the benefits of the Delhi govt's free healthcare facilities for the people.Addressing a press conference, Kejriwal said the biggest issue that troubles every elderly person as they age is the rising cost of treatment. He added that there would be no other criteria to be eligible for the Sanjeevani scheme except a valid voter I-card of Delhi. ""Whether you wish to get treated in a govt hospital or a private hospital, the entire cost of your treatment will be covered by the Delhi govt,"" Kejriwal announced. ""There will be no restrictions based on income. Everyone's treatment, whether rich or poor, will be provided free of cost. There will be no upper limit on the expenses,"" he said.AAP, in a statement, said that over 25 lakh senior citizens were likely to benefit from the scheme, which will not have any income or socio-economic restrictions, and health cards would be issued without any discrimination. When asked, govt sources said no calculations of the estimated expenditure on the scheme were done so far. ""A proper policy will be made, and the modalities will be worked out in due course of time,"" said a source.Highlighting the success of the free pilgrimage scheme for senior citizens, under which nearly one lakh senior citizens so far undertook pilgrimages to various parts of the country, Kejriwal said it was his ""responsibility"" to ensure the good health of every elder in Delhi. ""Your son will take full responsibility for keeping you healthy in your old age. In return, I only ask for your blessings,"" Kejriwal said.The announcement made by the former Delhi CM was applauded by his party colleagues on X.

NEW DELHI: Giving trial courts full discretionary freedom in formulating their decisions in bail matters, Supreme Court has ruled that no constitutional court, be it SC or HC, can dictate a format for grant of bail to accused to be mandatorily followed by judicial officers.The court quashed proceedings initiated by Rajasthan high court against district and sessions judge Ayub Khan for not sticking to the format devised by it that mandated specifying the criminal antecedents of the accused in a tabular form while granting bail.The bench of Justices A S Oka and A G Masih also expunged all adverse remarks against Khan and said injustice had been done to him by HC as ""non-compliance of the format stipulated by HC cannot be treated as an act of indiscipline or contempt"".Writing the judgment, Justice Oka said, ""No constitutional court can direct trial courts to write orders on bail applications in a particular manner. One judge of a constitutional court may be of the view that trial courts should use a particular format.

Her emotional return to her home in the Quresh Nagar shanty settlement near Kurla (E) railway station marked the end of a journey of unimaginable hardship.Speaking to TOI on Wednesday from the comfort of her home on Wednesday, Hamida expressed gratitude saying, ""I had lost all hope of ever returning to India, but thanks to Maroof, Shaikh, and the cooperation between the Indian and Pakistani governments, I have come back home with respect and honour."" Her family and neighbours gathered around and fed celebratory sweets to one another.Hamida observed how her Kurla neighbourhood has changed drastically over the years, with new buildings and crowded streets, making it nearly unrecognisable. ""If I had come alone, I would not have been able to find my house,"" she added. Fortunately, her family had not moved from that shanty despite the passage of decades.Deceived in 2002 by a recruitment agent who promised her a job in Dubai, Hamida was instead trafficked to Hyderabad (Sind) from where she travelled to Karachi. There, she faced relentless struggles, often living on the streets or seeking refuge in mosques. For a time, she managed to run a small shop to survive.She later married a Pakistani Sindhi man, and after his death a few years ago, she remained with her stepson's family in Manghopir, Karachi.

Moved by her plight, Maroof interviewed her and shared her story online, seeking help from Indian viewers.Mumbai blogger Khulfan Shaikh, who saw that video, played a pivotal role by assisting in tracing Hamida's family in Kurla. The combined cross-border efforts of these individuals, along with the governments of India and Pakistan, made her repatriation possible.Hamida's story stands as a testament to resilience and the power of social media collaboration across borders, offering a ray of hope to similar stranded persons who are separated from their loved ones.","Hamida Banu, 75, was trafficked to Karachi over two decades ago.

Setback for singer TM Krishna as SC says shouldn't be given MS Subbulakshmi award,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/setback-for-singer-tm-krishna-as-sc-says-shouldnt-be-given-ms-subbulakshmi-award/articleshow/116370177.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday said that Carnatic vocalist TM Krishna should not be recognised as the recipient of the MS Subbulakshmi award. It issued notices to Krishna, the Music Academy, and others on a plea filed by MS Subbulakshmi’s grandson, who challenged the use of the legendary singer’s name for the award, claiming it violated her will.The apex court on Sunday had declined to immediately intervene, stating that an appeal against the Madras high court’s order allowing the award could only be heard on Monday. Chief Justice of India Sanjiv Khanna remarked, “The appeal will be heard on Monday, and the award could be taken back if the court ultimately finds any merit in the case.”Earlier, the Music Academy was granted relief when a division bench of the Madras high court stayed a single judge’s order restraining the academy from using Subbulakshmi’s name for the award. The bench of Justices S S Sundar and P Dhanabal observed, “From the plain reading of the contents of the Will, the testatrix did not want anybody to form or create or make any trust, foundation, or memorial of any kind including erecting of any statue or bust in her name or in her memory.”However, the bench rejected the interpretation that Subbulakshmi intended to forbid the conferment of awards in her name, stating, “Had it been the intention of the testatrix that no award shall be conferred on anyone in her name, that could have been expressed in simple language. An interpretation contrary to the plain language of the instrument is not permissible in law.”The court noted that during her lifetime, Subbulakshmi had acknowledged several works and awards instituted in her name, and such practices were not in dispute. It also highlighted that the plaintiff, her grandson, had not included other organisations that had instituted similar awards in her name, adding, “This court is unable to reject the contention or stand taken by appellants that the suit and the interlocutory application is not for a bona fide cause, but with an oblique motive against Krishna.”After the Madras high court on Friday allowed the Music Academy to proceed with the award, senior advocate N Venkataraman urgently mentioned the matter in the Supreme Court. The award ceremony took place on Sunday despite the pending appeal.","Supreme Court issues notices to Krishna, the Music Academy, and others on a plea filed by MS Subbulakshmi’s grandson.

CHANDIGARH: Surprising fans during a live show in Chandigarh, singer-actor Diljit Dosanjh announced that he ""won't perform (live) in India until infrastructure for it is improved.""Stopping in the middle of a throbbing presentation on Saturday, he said, ""Instead of bothering us (artistes), improve your concert infrastructure or I will not perform in India... I want to say this to the administration. We do not have proper facilities for live shows here. It is a big revenue source. A lot of people work (on these events) and get employment due to it. So, please pay heed to it.""The statement was received by a fawning audience in the packed space with thunderous applause. Dosanjh also made it a point to say that it is not he who calls children to his recitals, but ""parents bring them"".Following Telangana's move some time ago, Chandigarh Commission for Protection of Child Rights had issued an advisory regarding ""maintaining noise level, not inviting kids to stage, and not singing songs promoting drugs, alcohol and violence"" during the performance.In a video that has now been shared widely on the social media, the singer, who has starred in films like ‘Chamkila’ and ‘Udta Punjab’, can be heard asking: “Will you stop me like this?”Dosanjh’s much-in-demand Dil-Luminati India tour , which kicked off in Delhi on Oct 26 and has drawn massive crowds in every city it has premiered, has had it rough with the administrations in various states across country. It has been fraught with challenges for the entertainer.Ahead of his concert in Hyderabad on Nov 15, Telangana govt issued a notice to Dosanjh asking him to “refrain from performing songs that promote alcohol, drugs, or violence”. It came after a professor from Chandigarh, Panditrao Dharennavar, filed a representation to authorities to not allow Dosanjh “sing such songs”. Accordingly, the singer at that time changed the lyrics of some of his songs, but criticised Telangana govt for restrictions imposed on him.His next in Ahmedabad saw him issue a challenge of his own. “If alcohol consumption is banned nationwide, I will no longer sing songs that mention it,” he had said.It was worse in Indore. Bajrang Dal and Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) workers held a protest near the venue hours before the concert began. In response, Dosanjh dedicated his concert in the city to poet Rahat Indori, a resident of Indore who had died in 2020, and recited his lines: “If they oppose, let them; life is not at stake. This is just smoke, not the sky. Everybody’s blood (sacrifice) is mixed in this land’s soil, Hindustan is not anyone’s property.”","Singer-actor Diljit Dosanjh says he won't perform in India until infrastructure for it is improved.

Atul Subhash suicide case: Allahabad HC grants anticipatory bail to Nikita Singhania's uncle,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/atul-subhash-suicide-case-allahabad-hc-grants-anticipatory-bail-to-nikita-singhanias-uncle/articleshow/116376569.cms,"Atul Subhash.

NEW DELHI: The Allahabad high court on Monday granted anticipatory bail to Sushil Singhania, the uncle of Nikita Singhania, in the suicide case of Artificial Intelligence engineer Atul Subhash. Justice Ashutosh Srivastava passed the order while hearing the bail application filed on behalf of Atul's wife, Nikita Singhania, and her in-laws.According to a Bengaluru Police official, Nikita Singhania was arrested in Gurugram, Haryana, while her mother, Nisha Singhania, and brother, Anurag Singhania, were arrested in Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh, for allegedly abetting Atul Subhash’s suicide. They were taken into custody on Saturday, brought to Bengaluru, and sent to judicial custody for 14 days after being presented in a local court.In the high court, senior counsel Manish Tiwary argued that while Nikita, Nisha, and Anurag had already been arrested, the anticipatory bail application was being pressed solely on behalf of Sushil Singhania.It was argued that the arrests were based on a suicide note and a video that had circulated online. The counsel submitted that Sushil Singhania, aged 69, suffers from chronic medical issues, is incapacitated, and could not have abetted the suicide.The counsel further argued that there is a difference between harassment and abetment, claiming that even if the suicide note is considered, the allegations suggest harassment rather than abetment. It was also submitted that Section 108, 3(5) of the BNS might not apply to the case.After hearing the arguments, the court ruled, “Considering the above, the court is of the opinion that applicant Sushil Singhania is entitled to get the privilege of pre-arrest (Transit) Anticipatory.”The court directed that if the applicant is arrested in connection with the case, he should be released on anticipatory bail until the police file a report under Section 173(2) of the CrPC. The applicant was asked to furnish a personal bond of ₹50,000 and two sureties of the same amount to the satisfaction of the magistrate or concerned court.The court also imposed conditions: the applicant must be available for police interrogation as required, must not influence witnesses, and cannot leave India without prior court permission. If the applicant has a passport, it must be submitted to the concerned SSP or SP.","The Allahabad high court granted anticipatory bail to Sushil Singhania, the uncle of Nikita Singhania.

Aaron Rodgers Discusses Super Bowl’s Impact on Love Life



In Netflix 's Aaron Rodgers: Enigma, a three-part docuseries, the enigmas surrounding the personal and professional life of the NFL's most iconic figure are slowly unwoven. The 41-year-old quarterback has found fame in Super Bowl victory and four-time MVP status but is not mincing words about discussions on the unglamorous aspects of the journey, such as the price of fame and how public those relationships are.Rodgers makes it candidly clear that he really hates it, which he admits is a side effect of his skyrocketing rise as a result of the Green Bay Packers' Super Bowl victory in 2010 over the Pittsburgh Steelers. In that second episode of the series, he recalls how dehumanizing that success could become. From visits to the White House to late-night talk shows, he bemoans the demands of celebrity athletes as exhausting.""I always find it interesting when people say, in reference to the off-the-field attention, 'Well, this is what you signed up for,'"" Rodgers says. ""I say f--- that, I never signed up for that. I signed up for football because I love the game and I got great at it because I'm hyper-competitive and super-motivated. But there's this whole other part that comes with it that's a lot of great stuff and a lot of f---ing weird stuff.""The quarterback states that this unwanted attention increased even more when the media began throwing around questions about his personal life. Paparazzi interest increased when he dated actress Olivia Munn , race car racer Danica Patrick , and actress Shailene Woodley Rodgers' love life has always been a big topic among tabloids, thus complicating the tug-of-war he already has with fame. His affairs with Munn (2014-2017), Patrick (2018-2020), and Woodley (2020-2022) were closely watched by the public.Reflecting on this in the documentary, he admits, ""I didn’t do myself any favors with some of the girls I dated after that that were in the public eye.""The relationship with Munn, particularly with him, came under scrutiny because reports indicated that it strained the family dynamics. Post their breakup, Rodgers went ahead with Patrick but again this love affair too ended in two years. During the pandemic, things became quieter in his personal life since he was dating Woodley before announcing his engagement in 2021 and later separated a year after.Rodgers confesses, “I definitely hated it at first—like, really despised it. I enjoyed my private life. I enjoyed being able to go places. But from Super Bowl MVP, MVP, State Farm commercials, that got a little bit more difficult.”The documentary also raises questions about family dissociation in the life of Rodgers and his involvement with many controversies surrounding his outspoken opinions about COVID, 9/11, and Sandy Hook. Such were reported to have cost him friendships, making it more difficult to navigate the fame.Also Read: Who is Joe Burrow's girlfriend?

The student has been identified as 14-year-old Rubi Patricia Vergara , a freshman remembered for her creativity, kindness, and love of the arts.Rubi Patricia’s obituary, released on Thursday, paints a picture of a vibrant young girl who touched the lives of many. “She was an avid reader, loved art, singing, and playing keyboard in the family worship band,” the obituary read. Attempts by the Associated Press to contact Rubi Patricia’s family on Wednesday evening were unsuccessful.Born on March 17, 2010, in Madison, to Vicente and Jennifer Vergara, Rubi Patricia had a deep love for her pets, Ginger (cat) and Coco (dog), and shared a special bond with her family. A funeral service is planned for Saturday, December 21, at City Church in Madison, followed by burial at Roselawn Memorial Park.The shooting unfolded during a study hall session around 11 a.m. The shooter, identified as 15-year-old Natalie Rupnow—who also went by Samantha—used a 9 mm pistol to kill a teacher and Rubi Patricia before injuring six others and ultimately taking her own life with a self-inflicted gunshot wound.While the teacher’s name has not yet been released, the community mourns both lives lost and prays for the recovery of the injured.Police responded swiftly after a teacher made a 911 call reporting the attack. Investigators are now probing possible motives, including allegations of bullying and Rupnow’s online activity.School shootings by female perpetrators are extraordinarily rare, making Natalie Rupnow ’s actions all the more shocking.Rubi Patricia’s death leaves a profound void in the Madison community, which continues to grapple with the senseless loss of young life.

'I read it for you': Vivek Ramaswamy

Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, the two co-chiefs of the Department of Government Efficiency, slammed that stopgap spending deal and said all Congress members should vote against the bill as the excessive spending would hurt many. The stopgap measure's text, released days before the December 20 shutdown deadline, aims to push the deadline and give the next Congress and incoming president more time to decide how the government should be funded for the majority of next year.""Keeping the government open until March 14 will cost ~$380BN by itself, but the true cost of this omnibus CR is far greater due to new spending. Renewing the Farm Bill for an extra year: ~$130BN. Disaster relief: $100BN. Stimulus for farmers: $10BN. The Francis Scott Key Bridge replacement: $8BN. The proposal adds at least 65 cents of new spending for every dollar of continued discretionary spending,"" Ramaswamy wrote in a lengthy post.""The legislation will end up hurting many of the people it purports to help. Debt-fueled spending sprees may ""feel good"" today, but it's like showering cocaine on an addict: it's not compassion, it's cruelty. Farmers will see more land sold to foreign buyers when taxes inevitably rise to meet our obligations. Our children will be saddled with crippling debt. Interest payments will be the largest item in our national budget.""""Congress has known about this deadline since they created it in late September. There's no reason why this couldn't have gone through the standard process, instead of being rushed to a vote right before Congressmen want to go home for the holidays. The urgency is 100% manufactured & designed to avoid serious public debate.""Ramaswamy also criticized the size of the bill -- 1,547 pages -- and said that it could have easily been under 20 pages.Calling it an early test for DOGE, Ramaswamy said the bill should fail.""This bill should not pass,"" Elon Musk bluntly wrote as he also posted a photo of the physical bill mocking its enormous size. ""Make sure your elected representatives know how you feel about this gigantic spending bill! Musk wrote.Vivek Ramaswamy also put out a video saying that the bill was made exceptionally long so that no one reads it. ""Congress is about to pass a bill that blows away your taxpayer money but they made it over 1500 pages long so you wouldn't read it. I did you a favor. I read it for you. It's supposed to be about keeping government operations open and providing disaster relief aid to Hurricane victims which I'm sympathetic to. If you read the bill carefully, it contains pay raises for members of Congress and, I'm not making this up, an expansion of their federal health benefits. It contains all kinds of special interests and pork funding, including opening up a new stadium in Washington DC. It renews the Global Engagement Center...""

Mayo's challenges ignite Vrabel talk for Patriots' job



🚨 Jerod Mayo hired as Patriots' next head coach 🚨 | Get Up

Jerod Mayo and Patriots face significant overhaul in 2025



Jerod Mayo ’s first season as head coach of the New England Patriots has been challenging, with a stagnant offense and a struggling defense raising doubts about his future. Despite a few bright spots like Drake Maye and Hunter Henry, questions are swirling around Mayo’s job security. Former Patriot Mike Vrabel , long linked to the role, could be eyeing a return if the team decides to move on from Mayo .Jerod Mayo's first year as New England Patriots head coach has been far from smooth. Taking over for the legendary Bill Belichick, Mayo’s challenge was always steep, but the team’s stagnant offense and regressing defense have raised serious questions. With only Drake Maye and Hunter Henry showing promise, Mayo's comments on the team's struggles have sparked rumors about his future.Former Patriot Mike Vrabel, a three-time Super Bowl champion with the team, has long been linked to the role. Though Robert Kraft previously backed Mayo, NBC's Tom Curran suggests Vrabel would be open to taking the reins if the Patriots move on from Mayo.""Mike Vrabel would be interested in coaching for the New England Patriots. I think that he looks at the Patriots, and despite the warts, says, I'll go back there,"" Curran said on Arbella Early Edition.” (via: Sportskeeda)Throughout his time in Tennessee, Vrabel guided the Titans to 54 victories, establishing himself as a steady force for the franchise. However, despite his regular-season success, his playoff performances fell short of expectations. Now, Vrabel is bringing his expertise to the Cleveland Browns, where he serves as a coaching and personnel consultant, contributing to the team’s strategy and development.Also Read: Ex-49ers DB predicts Pro Bowl QB Brock Purdy set to secure deal worth $50 million As the 2024 season approaches, the New England Patriots are in an enviable position with the most cap space in the league. According to Spotrac, they’re projected to have a whopping $132 million to work with, far ahead of the next closest teams: the Las Vegas Raiders ($112 million), Arizona Cardinals ($104 million), Washington Commanders ($101 million), and Chicago Bears ($82 million).This financial flexibility gives head coach Gerard Mayo a golden opportunity to secure top-tier talent. Additionally, with a projected top-three pick in the upcoming NFL draft , the Patriots are poised to strengthen their roster in a major way. While bolstering the offensive line is a clear priority, the team faces an intriguing dilemma: passing on standout WR/CB prospect Travis Hunter could draw criticism, especially given the current state of their wide receiver corps.","Jerod Mayo's first year as New England Patriots head coach has been far from smooth.

Bond yields climb, stock market feels the squeeze

Winners and losers on Wall Street

Global markets and economic uncertainty

Economic outlook clouds amid inflation and political shifts

US stock markets endured one of their most severe declines of the year on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve signaled a shift in its monetary policy trajectory. The S&P 500 fell 2.9%, narrowly missing its largest loss of 2024, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted by 1,123 points, or 2.6%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite suffered the worst drop, declining 3.6%.The central bank announced its third rate cut of the year, lowering its main interest rate to a range of 4.25% to 4.50%. However, it was the Fed’s updated projections for 2025 that rattled investors: Policymakers now anticipate only two additional cuts next year, down from four projected just three months ago.“We are in a new phase of the process,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said, explaining the tempered outlook as a response to robust job market performance, rising inflation readings, and economic uncertainties, including the upcoming Trump administration’s policies.Treasury yields surged following the Fed's announcement, exerting additional pressure on stocks. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.51% from 4.40%, while the two-year yield, more sensitive to Fed actions, increased to 4.35% from 4.25%.Higher yields typically hurt stock valuations, particularly for companies reliant on borrowing to drive growth. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies tumbled 4.4%, reflecting the acute impact of rising interest rates on smaller-cap stocks.“We’re seeing the market recalibrate for a ‘higher for longer’ rate environment,” said Sam Stovall of CFRA Research. “The Fed’s announcement caught investors off guard, eroding confidence in the expected pace of rate reductions.”Among individual stocks, General Mills fell 3.1% despite better-than-expected quarterly profits, as its lowered profit forecast for the year spooked investors. Nvidia, a significant driver of this year’s market rally, dropped 1.1%, extending its losses to over 13% since its record high last month.Conversely, Jabil surged 7.3% after reporting stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings and raising its full-year revenue forecast.Global markets displayed mixed reactions. In London, the FTSE 100 rose marginally by less than 0.1%, buoyed by data showing UK inflation at an eight-month high. The Bank of England is expected to keep rates unchanged when it announces its decision on Thursday.Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 0.7%, even as Nissan shares jumped 23.7% on reports of potential collaboration with Honda. Meanwhile, Mitsubishi Motors, partly owned by Nissan, saw its shares soar nearly 20%.Powell noted that while rate cuts could stimulate economic growth, they also risk exacerbating inflation. “When the path is uncertain, you go a little slower,” he said, likening the Fed’s approach to navigating a foggy night.Lingering inflationary pressures and the transition to the Trump administration have introduced additional variables into the Fed’s calculus. Powell acknowledged that some officials are already weighing the implications of potential fiscal policy changes, including tariffs and spending initiatives.Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack was the lone dissenter in Wednesday’s decision, arguing against the rate cut.As Wall Street digests the Fed’s outlook, concerns grow that the anticipated “Santa Claus rally” may be replaced by further volatility, with analysts suggesting that traders may lock in profits amid uncertainty.(With inputs from agencies)","The S&P 500 fell 2.9%, narrowly missing its largest loss of 2024.

Even Bill Gates will go bankrupt: Elon Musk



A deepfake video of Elon Musk endorsing a fake $20 million crypto giveaway is going viral, causing widespread confusion and concern. Sharing the video on X (formerly Twitter), DogeDesigner posted: “BREAKING: A deepfake of Elon Musk promoting a $20 million crypto giveaway is going viral.” The post further warned: “Elon Musk and his companies are NOT running any crypto giveaways. Don’t fall for scams! Stay safe.”In the video, Elon Musk can be seen saying “Here’s a surprise for everyone. I’ll be doing a $20 million crypto giveaway at Elon4u.com for one week starting on December 13.” He further adds “ If I am serious? Yes, go to Elon4u.com. It’s just a few quick steps that shouldn’t take longer than three minutes”.The Tesla CEO wrote on X that Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates might go bankrupt if Tesla becomes “the world’s most valuable company by far,” reigniting the feud over Gates’ short position against the electric vehicle giant. At present, Tesla’s market capitalization sits at $1.251 trillion, trailing far behind Apple Inc. – the world’s largest company, which leads at $3.729 trillion. For Tesla to claim the top spot, it would need to grow by nearly 200%.In the post on X, Musk wrote “If Tesla does become the world’s most valuable company by far, that short position will bankrupt even Bill Gates”. Short position here refers to a stock market strategy where an investor borrows shares of a stock they do not own, sells them on the open market, and aims to buy them back later at a lower price. The goal is to profit from a decline in the stock's price.","A deepfake video of Elon Musk endorsing a fake $20 million crypto giveaway is going viral, causing widespread confusion and concern.

WWE production head Lee Fitting has been surrounded by controversy



WWE has endured several misconduct allegations against several personalities in the company. To add insult to injury, another controversial case of misconduct followed the company after Vince McMahon and Co. In a recent report, it was revealed that Lee Fitting , who joined WWE as a production head, was fired from his previous company, ESPN , over misconduct. The incident sparked a huge discussion among fans as it came to light.WWE hired Lee Fitting, a former ESPN executive, earlier this as its Head of Media and Production. It is no secret that behind the popularity and regaining WWE’s glory, Fitting was partly responsible. However, a new report from The Athletic reveals a troubling past of the executive.ESPN fired Fitting after reports surfaced of inappropriate behavior, including making sexual or degrading jokes and creating a toxic work environment that encouraged similar conduct. Many current and former ESPN employees allege Fitting alienated those who challenged him or his actions.Fitting who was a senior vice president of production at ESPN was fired after his 25-year-old tenure. According to a report from The Athletic on Wednesday, Fitting was fired following an HR complaint about inappropriate behavior in August 2023.After the complaint was filed, an investigation was conducted, during which ESPN officials interviewed several employees. Some “prominent female staffers” was present in the meeting. In a memo sent on August 21, 2023, Norby Williamson, another top ESPN executive, announced that Fitting was “no longer with the company” and that ESPN would be “finalizing a new production structure” for the shows he managed, including College GameDay and Monday Night Football.The Athletic interviewed over 20 women, including six who were part of ESPN’s 2023 investigation. They described a workplace culture under Fitting where offensive and sexual language was common, with lewd jokes often made about women and their appearances.“I can’t believe it took this long,” one woman from the investigation who requested her anonymity due to still working in the company, said of the incident. “It finally caught up to him,” another said.The report revealed multiple allegations against Fitting and it has sparked a huge controversy as WWE has been dealing with a similar backlash. As of writing the piece WWE’s stance on the matter is unclear.Also Read: Janel Grant’s lawsuit against Vince McMahon, WWE, and John Laurinaitis officially resumes The controversy involving Fitting sparked following allegations against former WWE boss Vince McMahon by Janel Grant who worked in the company previously. While McMahon is set for trial, the report of Fitting has raised concern for the company. McMahon has left WWE and TKO Holdings following the allegations against his name. WWE has not responded to Fitting’s previous allegations but the decision of the company would be critical as taking another controversial blow would not be very pleasing for the company’s image amid its astonishing rise.","WWE hired Lee Fitting, a former ESPN executive, earlier this as its Head of Media and Production.

Did Sam Altman’s OpenAI murder Suchir Balaji?

The death of Suchir Balaji

Debunking the myths

Myth 1: Sam Altman killed Suchir Balaji

Myth 2: Balaji was murdered for exposing data misuse

Myth 3: The mystery surrounding Balaji’s death

OpenAI’s ethical and legal scrutiny

OpenAI's new marketing campaign amidst controversy

The tragic death of Suchir Balaji , a former researcher at OpenAI , has sparked a storm of conspiracy theories, with some alleging a sinister connection between his untimely death and his outspoken criticisms of the company.Balaji, who died in November 2024, had accused OpenAI of unethical data practices , particularly surrounding copyright infringement , before his death was ruled a suicide. However, speculations linking his death to murder, specifically by OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman , have been swiftly debunked by authorities and experts.Balaji, a 26-year-old Indian-American, was found dead in his San Francisco apartment on November 26, 2024. The San Francisco medical examiner’s office confirmed that the cause of death was suicide, with no signs of foul play.Balaji had previously raised concerns about OpenAI’s use of copyrighted material for training its AI models, a position he took after working with the company for almost four years.However, following his death, unfounded rumors began to circulate, with some suggesting that OpenAI or its CEO, Sam Altman, may have played a role in his demise.There is no credible evidence to suggest any connection between Altman or anyone from OpenAI and Balaji’s death. Despite conspiracy theories fueled by Balaji’s criticisms, the police and medical examiner have reported no signs of external involvement. The ruling on the cause of death remains suicide.While Balaji had concerns over OpenAI’s use of copyrighted material, there is no evidence that he was murdered to silence him. His concerns were primarily focused on ethical data sourcing, not on allegations of stealing customer data. OpenAI maintains that its data use adheres to fair use principles and legal precedents.The emotional and sensationalist response to Balaji’s death has fueled a sense of mystery, but investigations by the authorities have found no signs of foul play. Speculation about a murder, driven by conspiracy theorists, lacks any substantiated basis.Balaji’s criticisms highlighted ongoing debates in the AI industry about the ethics of training models on vast amounts of data, including copyrighted content. While OpenAI has denied accusations of wrongdoing, the company, like other tech giants, faces legal challenges regarding its data practices. These discussions around AI ethics and copyright laws are crucial as the industry continues to grow and evolve.OpenAI, under the leadership of Sam Altman, has been at the center of many debates about AI’s role in society, particularly in the context of privacy, data rights, and corporate responsibility. Altman’s leadership style has also attracted attention, especially after his brief ousting and reinstatement at OpenAI in 2023.Despite the ongoing controversy surrounding Balaji’s death, OpenAI has remained focused on its marketing initiatives. A report by the American Bazaar suggests that OpenAI might be diverting attention from the incident by focusing on a new marketing campaign.Just days after the tragic incident, the company launched its “Shipmas” campaign on December 5, 2024, a holiday marketing push featuring new product launches over 12 days leading up to Christmas. This campaign, which includes the unveiling of new AI models like o1, demonstrates OpenAI’s commitment to expanding its product offerings and solidifying its position in the competitive AI market.","Suchir Balaji, a 26-year-old Indian-American, was found dead in his San Francisco apartment on November 26, 2024.
