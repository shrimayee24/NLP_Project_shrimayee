'Using our dollars to buy Russian oil': Navarro attacks India again; takes 'laundromat' jibe,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/using-our-dollars-to-buy-russian-oil-navarro-attacks-india-again-takes-laundromat-jibe/articleshow/123575727.cms,"Trump's Trade Advisor Blames PM Modi for Ukraine War, Peter Navarro Targets India Over Russia Oil

NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trump’s trade advisor Peter Navarro on Friday renewed his attack on India, accusing New Delhi of using American trade dollars to finance Russia’s war in Ukraine.Justifying Washington’s newly imposed 50 per cent tariffs on Indian imports, Navarro said that Indian refiners, working with “silent Russian partners,” were making huge profits by refining Russian oil and selling it in international markets while “Russia pockets hard currency to fund its war on Ukraine.”In a post on X, Navarro said, “India uses our dollars to buy discounted Russian crude. This isn’t just about India’s unfair trade—it’s about cutting off the financial lifeline India has extended to Putin’s war machine.”According to Navarro, “Before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Russian oil made up less than 1% of India’s imports. Today? Over 30% -- more than 1.5 million barrels a day. This surge isn’t driven by domestic demand—it’s driven by Indian profiteers and carries an added price of blood and devastation in Ukraine.”Also read - 'Trump won't budge' : US says Russia-Ukraine conflict is 'Modi's war' “India’s Big Oil lobby has turned the largest democracy in the world into a massive refining hub and oil money laundromat for the Kremlin,” he claimed, adding that India now exports more than 1 million barrels a day in refined petroleum, over half of the Russian crude it imports.Navarro said the Biden administration “largely looked the other way at this madness,” while President Trump was confronting it directly. “A 50% tariff -- 25% for unfair trade and 25% for national security -- is a direct response. If India, the world’s largest democracy, wants to be treated like a strategic partner of the US, it needs to act like one. The road to peace in Ukraine runs through New Delhi.”Also read - Western voices back India against Trump's tariff war Expanding on the criticism, he remarked, “While the United States pays to arm Ukraine, India bankrolls Russia even as it slaps some of the world’s highest tariffs on US goods, which in turn punishes American exporters. We run a $50-billion trade deficit with India—and they’re using our dollars to buy Russian oil. They make a killing and Ukrainians die.”“It doesn’t stop there. India continues to buy Russian weapons—while demanding that US firms transfer sensitive military tech and build plants in India. That’s strategic freeloading,” he added.The remarks follow Donald Trump’s decision earlier this week to double tariffs on Indian imports, citing both trade imbalances and national security concerns.Navarro told Bloomberg TV that it was “real easy” for India to get the penalty removed by halting Russian oil purchases, but accused New Delhi of being “arrogant” in insisting it was their sovereign right.“India, you’re the biggest democracy in the world, okay? Act like one... side with the democracies...(instead) you’re getting in bed with the authoritarians,” he said, reminding India of its long-standing border dispute with China. “These are not your friends folks, okay? And the Russians. I mean, come on!”Navarro also controversially referred to the Russia-Ukraine conflict as “Modi’s war,” insisting India’s purchases were funding Moscow’s aggression. When an anchor corrected him, saying “you mean Putin’s war,” Navarro doubled down, repeating it was “Modi’s war.”While Navarro praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi as “a great leader” and India as “a mature democracy with intelligent people running it,” he maintained that New Delhi’s oil deals with Moscow undermined its claim to be a trusted US partner.His comments have drawn criticism within US policy circles, with some analysts pointing out that Washington has not penalised China or the European Union for continuing to buy Russian energy. Others noted that the US itself imports Russian nuclear fuel and precious metals.","US President Donald Trump's trade advisor Peter Navarro renewed his attack on India.

"4 NE cities among 7 safest for women in India; Ranchi, Srinagar get lowest scores: NARI survey",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/4-ne-cities-among-7-safest-for-women-in-india-ranchi-srinagar-get-lowest-scores-nari-survey/articleshow/123575452.cms,"PTI file photo

NEW DELHi: Kohima, Visakhapatnam and Bhubaneswar are top scorers among seven cities that qualified as safest for women in the ‘Index on Women Safety (NARI) 2025’ — based on a survey conducted in 31 major cities covering all states. Ranchi and Srinagar have the lowest scores on the index.Among metropolitan cities, Mumbai figures among the top seven cities, while the set of seven cities with the lowest scores also includes capital Delhi and Kolkata.Besides Kohima, the northeastern cities of Aizawl, Gangtok and Itanagar figure among the top cities in the safety rankings, often correlating with higher gender equity, infrastructure, policing or civic participation.Faridabad, Patna and Jaipur are the other cites with the lowest score, correlating with poorer infrastructure, patriarchal norms or weaker institutional responsiveness, according to the survey, which captured perceptions and lived experiences of 12,770 women to generate the index.As far as the national average is concerned, the mean score is 65%, and cities in the index have been categorised as “much above”, “above”, “below”, and “much below” this benchmark.The ‘National Annual Report & Index on Women’s Safety (NARI) 2025’ conceived by data science company Pvalue Analytics was released by National Commission for Women chairperson Vijaya Rahatkar at a programme here.The NCW chief said a safe environment was crucial for building a developed and inclusive India and assured that the commission will build on the suggestions in the survey report to bridge the gaps to strengthen women safety.The report highlights that National Crime Records Bureau data presents only the tip of the iceberg —crimes actually registered. NARI shows that two out of three women do not report — meaning NCRB could miss two-thirds of events experienced by women.The report showed that while 60% of women surveyed felt “safe”, a significant 40% felt “not so safe” or “unsafe” in their cities. Perceptions of safety drop sharply at night, highlighting ongoing concerns about public infrastructure (lighting, patrolling) and societal factors, it said.However, when it comes to reporting of unsafe incidents, reporting remains low with only 33% of victims reporting their experiences to authorities, while 67% choosing not to report.Prevalence of harassment remains high with 7% women reporting at least one incident of harassment in public spaces in 2024. The highest risk group is women under 24 years of age (14% reported harassment). Verbal harassment was most common (58%), with physical, psychological, economic and sexual harassment reported less frequently.Neighborhoods (38%) and transport (29%) were the main hotspots for harassment. In terms of response 28% of women confronted harassers, 25% left the scene, 21% sought safety in crowds and 20% reported to authorities.The survey measured overall city safety, infrastructure, incidence and reporting of harassment, domain-wise safety (neighbourhood, transport, education, work, health, recreation, online), and confidence in authorities, among others.","Kohima, Visakhapatnam and Bhubaneswar are top scorers among seven cities that qualified as safest for women.

DHAKA/NEW DELHI: Border Security Force (BSF), at the DG-level talks with Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) in Pilkhana, Dhaka, took up the recurrent border attacks, assault and stone-pelting incidents against its personnel and Indian nationals by the Bangladeshi miscreants, saying that these had left 68 BSF personnel injured last year and another 35 until June 30 this year.BSF DG Daljit Singh Chawdhary and his BGB counterpart Major General Mohammad Ashrafuzzaman Siddiqui, during the talks held from Aug 25 to 28, discussed the issue of construction of single-row-fence (SRF) within 150 yards of the international border (IB) on the Indian side. While BGB DG raised concern over what he termed as “illegal construction work within 150 yards of IB”, Chawdhary underlined that SRF has no defence potential and is purely aimed at curbing and preventing trans-border crime.“Both sides mutually agreed to constructively engage the respective higher authorities for concurrence on the pending work within 150 yards of IB....(they) agreed to follow the laid-down procedure while erecting SRF,” said the joint statement issued by BSF and BGB at the end of the biannual talks, the last leg of which was held in February 2025 in New Delhi.At their joint press conference in Dhaka, Siddiqui objected to the use of lethal weapons by BSF against Bangladesh nationals intercepted on the international border.Chawdhary however clarified that a BSF personnel fires only in self-defence, that too as a last resort in the face of “imminent threat” to his life. “Such unfortunate occurrences can be avoided if a proper fence is put up in place on the border from both the sides,” he said.To maintain transparency in any such retaliatory action by BSF, the force will be providing around 5,000 body-worn cameras to its border personnel, a source told TOI.Another official said BSF response to attacks by border misadventures by Bangladeshi miscreants is always graded, and added that BGB must control potential intruders and trans-border criminals on its side, to prevent these mishaps.BSF and BGB chiefs meanwhile agreed to step up coordinated border patrols and undertake joint efforts to bring down the incidents of assault by intensifying public awareness about the sanctity of international border.Chawdhary elaborated on his concern regarding the delay on part of BGB and Bangladeshi authorities in taking back illegal Bangladeshi intruders apprehended by BSF. As per data shared with TOI, 2,404 incoming and 3,102 outgoing Bangladeshi nationals were apprehended by BSF within a year of the regime change in Dhaka.As regards trans-border insurgent groups and their camps, both sides agreed to adopt a zero-tolerance approach and take concurrent action based on real-time information.The next DG-level conference is provisionally scheduled to be held in New Delhi in March 2026.","Border Security Force (BSF) held talks with Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) in Pilkhana, Dhaka.

SSC Recruitment Scam: Massive Protest In Kolkata, Police Detains Protesting Teachers Amid Scuffles

Poll What is your opinion on the switch from TCS to Eduquity as the exam conducting agency? A positive change A negative change

NEW DELHI: Amid protests over glitches and irregularities in the conduct of computer-based govt recruitment examinations by the Staff Selection Commission (SSC), SSC chairman S Gopalakrishnan on Monday assured that the “technical and operational matters” faced by a few candidates in the first selection post examination on July 24, have been “stabilised” and no major disruptions anticipated in the upcoming exams.Gopalakrishnan said around 5.5 lakh candidates had appeared in the first exam, the first to be held after M/s Eduquity replaced M/s TCS as the exam conducting agency (ECA) in July 2025, with questions being set by other content agencies and delivered digitally from a vault. Some candidates at two of the total 194 centres faced issues due to bugs, like duplication of questions, repeat of same options, etc.“A detailed analysis by CDAC identified about 59,000 candidates affected by system disruptions. They will now retake the exam in three shifts on August 29, 2025,” he said adding that the stenographer exams conducted from Aug 6-8 had witnessed no disruptions. SSC has also rescheduled the Combined Graduate Level (CGL) Exam from August 13 to mid-September.On Congress alleging “rigging” of government recruitment exams under the Modi government and slamming the “brutal lathicharge” on those protesting against it, SSC alleged that the protests, led by coaching institutes, were aimed at protecting business models rather than the genuine interests of candidates.Elaborating on the recent SSC examination reforms, Gopalakrishnan said aadhaar-based authentication at the application level and exam venue has helped prevent impersonation and repeated attempts by candidates to appear in multiple sessions or to take the role of scribes and exam functionaries. Also, deviation from old question patterns had denied the coaching institutes undue advantage. Rather than a single agency like TCS performing all tasks, SSC, has, from July onwards, entrusted different aspects of the examinations to four agencies.Eduquity is now the ECA, even as content agencies set the questions, CDAC handles IT security and detects hacking/malpractices and an independent agency monitors the exams. The idea is that no single agency can hijack or compromise the exams, and to maintain transparency and fairness, according to Gopalakrishnan.He further noted that the content providers, ECA and monitoring agencies are subject to deterrent penalties for any shortcomings in performance.The multiple agency system, it was highlighted, has resulted in certain entities (led by some online tutors or coaching institutes) attributing the initial system hiccups to ECA and demanding that TCS be brought back. Gopalakrishnan however explained that Eduquity was selected through a tender, with TCS listed only at third position in the bid.","SSC chairman S Gopalakrishnan assured that the “technical and operational matters” faced by a few candidates in the first selection post examination on July 24, have been “stabilised” He said no major disruptions anticipated in the upcoming exams.

India–Canada Relations Set For Reset; Modi And Carney Seek To Mend Broken Ties | G7 Summit

NEW DELHI: After an ugly diplomatic spat over the killing of a Khalistan separatist that saw bilateral ties hit rock bottom last year, India and Canada took a significant step forward Thursday to normalise the relationship as they announced appointments of high commissioners in each other's capitals. This followed the agreement in June, when PM Narendra Modi met his counterpart Mark Carney, to take ""calibrated and constructive"" steps to stabilise ties.India announced the appointment of senior diplomat Dinesh Patnaik as the new high commissioner to Canada. Patnaik is presently India's ambassador to Spain and is expected to take up his new assignment shortly, according to the ministry of external affairs. Shortly after that, Canadian foreign minister Anita Anand announced the name of veteran diplomat Christopher Cooter, who has experience of having served in India earlier, as the new high commissioner to India.Modi had met Carney on the margins of the G7 summit in Alberta in June, agreeing to take steps to rebuild the relationship based on shared democratic values, respect for the rule of law, and commitment to upholding the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity.The two sides had then agreed to pursue a balanced partnership grounded in ""mutual respect for concerns and sensitivities, strong people-to-people ties, and growing economic complementarities"".Official sources said India will continue to pursue with Canadian authorities the need to act against Khalistan separatists who seek to hurt Indian interests.India had expelled dozens of diplomats earlier, as the relationship took a nosedive over the killing of Khalistan separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar for which Ottawa blamed the Indian govt. India always maintained that the govt led by Carney's predecessor Justin Trudeau never provided any evidence to back its claim. While Canada expelled Indian high commissioner Sanjay Verma and five other Indian diplomats accusing them of running a campaign of violence in Oct last year, India had said Verma and others were withdrawn because Canadian authorities had failed to ensure security for him and other Indian diplomats in an ""atmosphere of extremism and violence"".Ottawa Thursday described the fresh appointments as an important step towards restoring necessary diplomatic services to citizens and businesses in both countries.""The appointment of a new high commissioner reflects Canada's step-by-step approach to deepening diplomatic engagement and advancing bilateral cooperation with India. This appointment is an important development toward restoring services for Canadians while strengthening the bilateral relationship to support Canada's economy,"" said Anand. In line with the understanding reached in the Modi-Carney meeting, the two sides are also considering restarting talks for Early Progress Trade Agreement (EPTA) that could clear the path for a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA).According to Canada, Cooter has 35 years of diplomatic experience, having served most recently as Canada's charge d'affaires to Israel and as Canada's high commissioner to South Africa, Namibia, Lesotho, Mauritius and Madagascar. He has also served as first secretary in the Canadian high commission to India, Nepal and Bhutan, in New Delhi, from 1998 to 2000.","India and Canada announce appointments of high commissioners in each other's capitals.

"Bhagwat: 'For balance in society', families should ideally have 3 kids",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bhagwat-for-balance-in-society-families-should-ideally-have-3-kids/articleshow/123572502.cms,".

New Delhi: RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat Thursday said families should ideally have three children, calling it necessary for balance in society and future stability. Speaking on the final day of the '100 Years Journey of RSS: New Horizons' series, Bhagwat said demographic changes always have serious social and political effects, emphasising that both extraordinary rise and dips in birth rates can have problems. ""All scriptures say that societies with very few children gradually disappear. So, this balance must be maintained. Having three children is the right thing. Not less than three, not much more either,"" the RSS chief said.He also quoted doctors to say that three children, their births rightly spaced, are good for families as well as for their younger members as growing up with siblings helps in tempering egos.""To keep a civilisation alive, India's population policy suggests 2.1 (average number of children), which basically means three children. But resources have to be managed too, so we must restrict it to three,"" he said during a question-answer session on the last day of the RSS centenary lecture series.He said while Sangh is not leading an Ayodhya-kind movement for the ""reclamation"" of sites like Varanasi's Gyanvapi mosque and Mathura's Shahi Idgah, its members were free to join agitation for restoring the places to Hindus.Stressing India's Muslims are citizens who deserve livelihood and respect, Bhagwat added that people must value their mother tongues while also using English as a language of communication.Responding to a question, Bhagwat asserted that religion is by individual choice and there should be no allurement or force in this matter.

Teachers cross 1 cr mark even as school enrolment falls to 7-year low,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/teachers-cross-1-cr-mark-even-as-school-enrolment-falls-to-7-year-low/articleshow/123570200.cms,".

New Delhi: India has, for the first time, crossed the milestone of having more than one crore school teachers in a single academic year. This happened in 2024–25, even as the number of children enrolled in schools fell to its lowest in seven years.According to the Ministry of Education’s Unified District Information System for Education Plus (UDISE+), the total enrolment in schools stood at 24.68 crore in 2024–25, which is about 11 lakh less than the previous year. Officials said the fall in enrolment is mainly because of declining birth rates, though some states have shown a different trend. They added that the enrolment calculation is based on the 2011 Census population, which inflates the denominator in Gross Enrolment Ratio projections, and that the upcoming Census in 2026 will provide a clearer picture.Even though fewer children are coming into schools, the number of teachers has been rising steadily, improving the student-teacher balance. The UDISE+ data shows that at the foundational stage, the pupil-teacher ratio (PTR) is now 10, at the preparatory stage 13, at the middle stage 17, and at the secondary stage 21. These ratios are much better than the 1:30 benchmark suggested in the National Education Policy 2020.Teacher strength has gone up by 6.7% compared to 2022–23, a growth that officials said will ensure more individual attention to students, stronger teacher-student interaction and better classroom support.The overall enrolment has been shrinking over the last few years. In 2022–23, 25.18 crore students were enrolled, which dropped to 24.8 crore in 2023–24 and further to 24.68 crore in 2024–25. But alongside this fall, dropout rates have shown a sharp decline. At the preparatory stage, dropouts have come down from 3.7% to 2.3%; at the middle level, from 5.2% to 3.5%; and at the secondary level, from 10.9% to 8.2%. Officials said this shows that children are staying in schools longer and schools are becoming more responsive to students’ needs.Retention levels have also gone up. At the foundational stage, retention improved from 98.0% to 98.9%; at the preparatory level from 85.4% to 92.4%; at the middle level from 78% to 82.8%; and at the secondary level from 45.6% to 47.2%. The report said one major reason for the improvement at the secondary level is the increase in the number of schools offering secondary education, which has made access easier and encouraged students to continue.UDISE+ also reported a significant decline in single-teacher and zero-enrolment schools. Officials said this has been possible because of targeted government interventions aimed at rationalising schools and teacher allocation. The number of single-teacher schools fell by about 6% compared to last year, while schools with zero enrolment declined by nearly 38%. The report said this reduction is a sign of better planning and will help create a more balanced education system.","The total enrolment in schools stood at 24.68 crore in 2024–25, which is about 11 lakh less than the previous year.

NEW DELHI: Potholes claimed 2,161 lives in 2023, an increase of around 16.4% from the previous year, according to the latest report of the road transport ministry. Deaths caused due to wrong side driving and lane indiscipline also increased, to 9,432 in 2023 from 9,094 in the previous year.The road transport ministry released the report “Road Accidents in India 2023” on Thursday, barely days before the Aug-end deadline set by the Supreme Court to make it public. As per the report, nearly 1.73 lakh lives were lost on Indian roads in 2023, which meant one death every three minutes. While road deaths increased by around 2.6% compared to 2022, the number of persons injured went up by 4.4% to a little over 4.6 lakh.Speeding remained the main cause of fatalities, accounting for 68% of all deaths, followed by wrong side driving and lane indiscipline (5.5%). In pothole deaths, Uttar Pradesh recorded over half of the fatalities, followed by Madhya Pradesh.The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) under the home ministry, which also brings out annual accident reports, has not yet published the report for 2023.As per the road ministry report, young adults in the age group of 18-45 years accounted for nearly two-thirds of fatalities in 2023.Two-wheeler riders accounted for around 45% of deaths (77,539), followed by pedestrians (35,221) and car/taxi occupants (21,496), on different categories of roads.The report also highlighted that non-use of helmets by two-wheeler riders claimed 54,568 lives, while non-use of seatbelts resulted in 16,025 car fatalities.Among the types of collision, tailgating, or hit from the back, accounted for a maximum 36,804 deaths (21%), followed by 31,209 fatalities due to hit and run (18%). Head-on collisions were the reason for 28,898 fatalities (nearly 17%).According to the report, national highways, which comprise barely 2% of the country's entire road network, witnessed 31.2% of all road crashes and 36.5% of fatalities. State highways accounted for 22% of accidents and 22.8% deaths.","Potholes claimed 2,161 lives in 2023, an increase of around 16.4% from the previous year.

Since glanders are zoonotic, preventing its spread in equines also protects human health.Though the guidelines, issued by the animal husbandry and dairying ministry, primarily apply to these yatras with immediate effect, states may extend them to other religious/tourism-related journeys involving equines.The guidelines provide a uniform framework for mandatory registration and tagging of all equines, health certification with compulsory testing for glanders and equine influenza, and a minimum acclimatisation of working equines engaged in carrying pilgrims and goods to high-altitude areas during the yatras.It also prohibits night movement and makes insurance coverage for all working equines mandatory. There is also a provision of defined load limits for equines (80–90 kg for horses/mules, 50 kg for ponies and 25 kg for donkeys).Under the revised action plan on glanders, the ministry makes testing of equines in endemic and high-risk areas mandatory, supported by improved laboratory diagnostics and regular field inspections.The plan strengthens surveillance, diagnostic capacity, response measures and stakeholder engagement, incorporating recent experiences and scientific inputs to make the programme more robust and effective.","The move is expected to ensure safety of pilgrims during pilgrimages.

NEW DELHI: Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat on Thursday said there is no rift between the Sangh and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). He said the Sangh can give advice on any issue, but the final decision will be taken by the BJP.The RSS chief said there could be ""difference of opinion"" while working towards the goals of the country, but there was no “manbhed (heart-to-heart differences)”.""There are opinions, but we discuss and form a consensus to decide whether it is against one's opinion or in favour of it. I will follow the collective decision. When that nature is there, quarrel doesn't exist. There can be matbhed (difference of opinion) here, but no manbhed (heart-to-heart disagreement). We need to move forward in one direction, and not different ones,"" Bhagwat said during a three-day lecture series to mark the centenary year of the RSS.Bhagwat said the Sangh has good coordination with the Narendra Modi-led BJP government at the Centre, as it did with earlier governments.""We have good coordination with every government, be it state or central. Not only this one. But there are systems that have some internal contradictions.The system (of governance) in general is the same, which was invented by the British so that they could rule.

But we have to give him independence. There is no quarrel anywhere,"" he said.On the selection of the BJP president, Bhagwat said the RSS has no role. ""It’s completely wrong,"" he said, responding to a question on whether the Sangh decides everything for the BJP including its chief.""We don't decide. If we were deciding, would it have taken so long. We don’t do (decide). We don’t have to. Take your time. We don’t have to say anything,"" he said, drawing applause from the audience.He added that it is not possible for the RSS to take decisions for the BJP.The BJP, he said, has its own expertise in running political affairs, just as the RSS has in managing its shakhas.""I am running shakhas for last 50 years.

NEW DELHI: Air Chief Marshal A P Singh on Tuesday cautioned against rushing the rollout of theatre commands, stressing that India must adopt its own model instead of copying others. He suggested setting up a joint planning and coordination centre in Delhi, under the Chiefs of Staff Committee, to prepare for ""future wars.""Speaking at the Army War College, the Chief of Air Staff, cautioned against rushing into the creation of new theatre commands, warning that creating a new structure while disrupting everything is not a very good idea at this point of time.Instead, he proposed setting up a joint planning and coordination centre in Delhi, placed under the Chiefs of Staff Committee, to issue directions jointly saying, ""I personally feel that having a joint planning and coordination centre in Delhi is what is required.""Responding to questions on the proposed theatre commands, Singh said, ""yes, we can start with this first, implement it and see how it pans out. If we need any more structure, we can think about it. But disrupting everything and making one structure now at this time, I do not think it is a very good idea.""The Air Chief Marshal's remarks came three-and-a-half months after Operation Sindoor, which showcased strong coordination among the Army, Navy and Air Force.Citing the recent Operation Sindoor, a tri-service simulation held from May 7 to 10 against Pakistan, Singh underlined how the three service chiefs worked closely in planning and execution.The exercise, he said, reinforced both the primacy of air power and the value of coordination. He further noted that ""centrally planned"" decisions could still be executed in a decentralised framework, which in his view ""will work out the best.""He also cautioned against blindly following international models saying India should not be inspired by any other country, like the US, in rolling out theatre commands, stressing that the nation must design a framework suited to its own requirements.""Everybody has their own requirements. We need to think about what we need there, and then only we should go about it. Otherwise, we will go wrong,"" he said.""We should not just come under any pressure and say we have to implement it now. Somehow, we have to do it. It should not be done this way. I think we can stand our ground and discuss things,"" he added.The Air Force chief also underlined the need to focus on preparing for tomorrow's wars, where clarity in the chain of command will be critical.""You cannot have a theatre commander sitting somewhere... now whom they talk to, where do they get directions from. Phones are available but generally that does not work like that,"" he said.""I feel having joint planning and coordination at the apex level is what is required. If directions go from it, things will work out. We don't actually need another structure at the lower level,"" Singh added.The government’s proposed theaterisation model aims to bring the three services under unified commands to better integrate capabilities and use resources more effectively.Under the plan, each theatre command would combine units of the Army, Navy and Air Force to handle security challenges in a specific region. Currently, the three services operate under separate commands.","Air Chief Marshal A P Singh says India must adopt its own model instead of copying others.

Michael Jordan wins $8.9 million lawsuit against Dominick’s in 2015

Michael Jordan donates the proceeds and supports Chicago children

Also Read:

Even after retiring from the NBA, Michael Jordan has remained a strong and determined figure. Off the court, he is just as careful about his rights as he was about his game. One story from 2015 shows how seriously he protects his personal identity. Jordan’s actions sent a clear message about defending personal rights and giving back to the community at the same time.The case began in Chicago, Illinois, where Michael Jordan, the Hall of Famer and six-time NBA champion, noticed his name was used without permission. The Chicago-based supermarket chain Dominick’s, a subsidiary of Safeway that later closed in 2013, ran an advertisement in 2011 featuring Jordan’s name to promote a meat sale in a Sports Illustrated special issue. Jordan’s legal team said the chain had no right to use his name.The supermarket first offered a settlement of about $126,900, but Michael Jordan’s lawyers argued that the sum should match the real advertising value of his name. After the court reviewed the case, Jordan won $8.9 million. ESPN reported his comments after the verdict, saying,“No one, whether or not they’re a public figure, should have to worry about their identity being used without their permission.”Jordan added, “I hope this case sends a clear message…that I will continue to be vigilant about protecting my name and identity.”He further added:""The case was not about the money, as I plan to donate the proceeds to charity. It was about honesty and integrity.... I also hope the size of the monetary reward will deter others from using someone else's identity and believing they will only pay a small penalty.""Michael Jordan made it clear that the lawsuit was not about money. Instead, it was about integrity, honesty, and defending his personal rights. He pledged to donate the full $8.9 million to 23 charities in Chicago that support children’s health, education, and well-being. In a news release shared with ABA Journal, Jordan said, “Chicago has given me so much, and I want to give back to its kids, the city’s future.”At 62, Michael Jordan stands as more than a basketball legend—he is a cultural icon. The Dominick’s case highlights how he fiercely defends his rights and turns his victories into ways to help others.His careful attention to personal identity also comes amid other legal challenges, such as his 2015 lawsuit in China against Qiaodan Sports, which uses his name and number 23 without permission. This story originally appeared on ESPN and ABA Journal and highlights Michael Jordan’s commitment to personal rights, community support, and integrity both on and off the courtWith a $10 million contribution to Novant, Michael Jordan helped open his fourth ""Michael Jordan Family Medical Clinic"" in Wilmington, his hometown, in February 2025. The facility, which is 7,300-sq-ft and open to patients from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., offers primary care services in twelve patient rooms for underinsured and uninsured patients across five operating days each weekday. Building on earlier Charlotte and Wilmington clinics, Jordan's sincere comments stressed the importance of providing premium healthcare access to the neighborhood that molded him.","Michael Jordan wins $8.9 million lawsuit against Dominick’s in 2015.

Poll What is your favorite aspect of cultural festivals like Pacu Jalur? The traditional performances. The community spirit.

Western Indonesia’s centuries-old Pacu Jalur boat race has taken on a new life this year after an 11-year-old boy’s viral dance moves helped attract record crowds and international attention to the traditional river festival.This weekend, rowers paddled vigorously down the Kuantan River in Riau Province, cheered on by spectators drawn by the online fame of young Rayyan Arkan Dikha.A short clip of him dancing at the bow of one of the long wooden boats, swirling his hands and swinging his arms to rally the oarsmen, has racked up millions of views, drawing visitors from across the country and abroad.According to news agency AFP, international sports stars, including Formula One driver Alex Albon and MotoGP champion Marc Marquez even copied Rayyan’s routine in videos of their own, fuelling the craze further. “I came to watch Pacu Jalur because I wanted to film and show the festival to the world,” Australian tourist Duncan McNaught was quoted as saying by AFP, calling the event “awesome.”Tourism officials estimate the race could see 1.5 million spectators this year, up from 1.4 million last year, with revenue possibly rising to $4.6 million. “Compared to previous years, there weren’t any foreigners watching Pacu Jalur.Now there are,” said local tourism chief Roni Rakhmat, as cited by AFP.The festival, dating back to the 17th century, was once rooted in river transport but has since evolved into an annual August race featuring more than 220 teams. Prizes worth about 900 million rupiah ($55,000) are on offer, according to organisers.Residents said they were delighted by the boy’s unexpected role in globalising the event. “I think it’s super cool that a kid his age managed to create a personal branding through Pacu Jalur,” 18-year-old student Naysila Ayunita Sari was quoted as saying by AFP. “Through his dances, he has introduced Pacu Jalur to the entire world.”For long-time locals like Frima, the transformation of their riverbank into an international attraction is astonishing. “I never would have thought that all eyes are on this small place on the western side of Riau,” he said.“I’m grateful Pacu Jalur is now known worldwide”, he added.","Rayyan Arkan Dikha, 11, went viral for his calm dance on the bow of a traditional longboat, during the Pacu Jalur longboat race festival.

Ethel Caterham: The world’s oldest living person witnessing a century of change



Ethel Caterham: Family, lifestyle, and what her longevity inspiring the world



Also Read |

Ethel Caterham, a British centenarian residing in Lightwater, Surrey, has officially become the world’s oldest living person at 116 years old. Born on 21 August 1909, Caterham has lived through some of the most transformative events in modern history, including the Titanic disaster, the Russian Revolution, and both World Wars. She is also the last surviving subject of King Edward VII, representing a living connection to early 20th-century British monarchy. Recognised by King Charles III with a birthday card in 2024, Caterham’s milestone has captured global attention. Her story highlights the remarkable combination of longevity, resilience, and historical perspective, inspiring people worldwide to reflect on the extraordinary possibilities of human life, the evolution of society, and the enduring spirit of individuals who witness over a century of change.Ethel Caterham was born in Shipton Bellinger, Hampshire, as the second youngest of eight siblings. Growing up in a large family in early 20th-century England meant learning responsibility, cooperation, and resilience from an early age. Raised in Tidworth, Wiltshire, she witnessed a rural way of life during a time of social change and industrial expansion. Her childhood coincided with technological advances like the spread of electricity and the automobile, shaping the early experiences of a girl who would live through over a century of innovation.These formative years likely influenced her adaptability and endurance—traits that contribute significantly to longevity and reflect an era where perseverance, community values, and resourcefulness were essential for survival in challenging circumstances.As a teenager, Caterham worked as an au pair in India, an experience that not only broadened her cultural understanding but also introduced her to independence and responsibility at a young age. As reported by BBC, later in life, she moved to Hong Kong and Gibraltar, accompanying her husband Norman, who served as a lieutenant colonel in the British Army. These postings exposed her to diverse climates, cuisines, languages, and social customs, fostering mental agility and adaptability—qualities that studies suggest are linked to longer life expectancy. Living abroad during politically and socially dynamic periods also provided her with firsthand knowledge of global events, enriching her personal and historical perspective.Ethel Caterham’s life spans some of the most significant events of the last century. Born three years before the Titanic sank in 1912, she experienced the societal upheaval of the Russian Revolution in 1917 and lived through both World Wars. As reported, she has witnessed the rise and fall of empires, the advent of commercial aviation, the digital revolution, and major advances in medicine. Caterham’s personal story reflects the resilience and adaptability of individuals living through periods of profound uncertainty and change.

AMRITSAR: Embarrassed by a viral video showing its side of the parade path at Wagah border badly waterlogged - and its Rangers standing in knee-deep water - while the Indian side looks clean, Pakistan has blamed the elevation of Grand Trunk Road on the Indian side for the mess.The fact is India has already implemented a rainwater harvesting system and improved drainage management to prevent waterlogging.Pakistan is battling severe floods after relentless heavy rain over the past few days. Its side of the parade area at the site of the daily flag ceremony at the Wagah joint checkpost is wallowing in muddy knee-deep water. Sandbags are seen piled up at a few places on the Pakistani side ahead of the ceremony. In contrast, the Indian side is free of water, except for a small area near the international border gates.Sources say Pakistan has raised the elevation of GT Road with Indian authorities. Pakistan also hastily constructed drainage channels and elevated a portion of the road to facilitate water outflow. BSF IG, Punjab Frontier, Atul Fulzele said there was incessant and heavy rainfall on Aug 8-9, and the video was likely from that period.""There has been no waterlogging at any of the three sites of the ceremonial flag-lowering ceremonies - Attari, Hussainiwala, and Sadqi.

BENGALURU: Karnataka deputy chief minister DK Shivakumar has acknowledged Bengaluru’s chronic infrastructure problems while responding to a public appeal from Biocon chairperson Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw on social media.“Namma Bengaluru has the best talent and the best weather but the worst infrastructure — if we fix garbage, debris and roads, we can be among the best cities in the world.

A call for 90-hour workweeks



The 30-year old tech billionaire and co-founder of ScaleAI , Lucy Guo is making headlines for her intense work ethic and her advice to other startup founders . At the age of 30, Guo has become the youngest self-made female billionaires after Meta made a major investment in her company. After the investment, Guo’s net worth increase to $1.3 billion surpassing popular pop icon Taylor Swift.Apart from this, Guo is also known for her strict daily routine. She starts her day at 5.30 am with back-to-back workouts at Barry’s Bootcamp. She also skips her lunch in order to main her momentum during working hours. In an interview with CNBC, Guo said, “Most people could have work-life balance if they cut out what they waste time on after work—like doom scrolling or watching TV.”Her daily routine also includes working till midnight and socialising till 2 a.m, but she still wakes up early for her workout routine. She claims that her ability to function with minimal sleep gives her more hours in the day as compared to others.Guo also shared an advice for startup founders. She urged the founders to embrace a 90-hour workweek at least in the initial period of building the company. Her stance echoes the controversial “996” culture—working 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week—prevalent in parts of China’s tech industry.“When you’re first starting your company, it’s near impossible to do it without doing that,” she said, emphasizing that extreme effort is essential to get things off the ground.While Guo’s discipline has earned admiration, her work philosophy has drawn criticism from mental health advocates and startup veterans.",Lucy Guo is a 30-year-old tech billionaire and co-founder of ScaleAI.

Nvidia’s rise: A talent gap in semiconductors

Nvidia recently reported its second-quarter revenue. The company reported revenue of $46.74 billion, a 56% year-over-year jump, beating Wall Street’s forecast of $46.02 billion. Despite the strong numbers, shares fell 3.14% post-earnings, reflecting investor caution. Billionaire investor and PayPal co-founder Peter Theil praises Nvidia’s chip monopoly but cautions against chasing the hype.

Speaking at the All-in Summit in September 2024, Theil talked about his perception on the ongoing AI race .As reported by Bezinga, speaking at the All-In Summit in September 2024, PayPal co-founder and venture capitalist Pete Theil refused to crown a winner the in AI arm race between Sam Atlman, Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk. Instead of this, Theil turned the spotlight on Nvidia and praised the company for its grip on the hardware layer of AI. He said, ""It's Nvidia, it's the hardware, the chips layer,"" adding that they are ""making all the money while everybody else is collectively losing money.""“Whoever I talk to last … I find very convincing in the moment,” Thiel joked, reflecting on his shifting views after conversations with Musk and others. He criticized OpenAI’s former nonprofit structure as “preposterous,” suggesting its chaotic governance may have justified its pivot to a for-profit model.Thiel attributed Nvidia's current monopoly to a generational shift in talent, noting that after 1993, talented people gravitated toward software rather than semiconductors, leaving the field open for companies like Nvidia to dominate.He emphasised that most of the founders flocked to software, Nvidia quietly focused on building monopoly in GPUs which is now the backbone of AI infrastructure. “They’re making all the money while everybody else is collectively losing money,” Thiel noted.Despite the promising growth showed by Nvidia, Theil voiced his concern about the AI investment frenzy. Comparing it to the dot-com bubble, he said the current climate feels “uncomfortably close to 1999.”He acknowledged Nvidia’s blockbuster performance but warned that its stock may no longer be a bargain. “Maybe a year ago or two years ago, Nvidia would have been a good buy,” Thiel said. “Now everyone knows they’re making too much money and everyone’s trying to copy them.”","PayPal co-founder and venture capitalist Pete Theil spoke at the All-In Summit in September 2024.

Anupam Mittal: AI can’t fake courage

Here’s the LinkedIn post shared by Anupam Mittal

A founder recently bragged -

‘I get all my ideas from ChatGPT’

He thought it was a flex. I saw a red flag 🚩

Because Gen AI mostly averages existing knowledge. It sounds brilliant > smooth, confident, articulate but too often it’s just platitudes and polite sycophancy.

I’ve seen AI-written mails from senior leaders that read like genius… and meant nothing. In fact, its pretty obvious its a senseless Ctrl C Ctrl V ❌

Same with decks, pitches, even ‘strategy notes’ churned out start-to-finish by a model.

Outsourcing judgement isn't leadership 🤷

The best managers and founders I know use AI for speed and structure but the instinct, the angles, the contrarian call, the uncomfortable decision? That’s all on them.

My take - AI can fake intelligence. It can’t fake courage or an original point of view.

The reason for this important market trend is the increasing short build up by the FIIs. The negative sentiments in the market triggered by the 50% Trump tariff and the high valuations in India has encouraged the FIIs to increase their short positions. September series historically has been known for big moves. A quick decision on the tariff policy can lead to reversal of sentiments and short covering. We don’t know whether this will happen.“The policy initiatives in India - the fiscal stimulus through the Budget, monetary stimulus through rate cuts and the coming GST rationalisation- should revive economic growth and corporate earnings in India in the coming quarters.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","As job cuts continue to rise in various industries, some employees are going for 'career cushioning' Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Ex-OpenAI VP exec raises 'salary alarm' on AI talent war; says: HR departments will have to ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ex-openai-vp-exec-raises-salary-alarm-on-ai-talent-war-says-hr-departments-will-have-to-/articleshow/123575822.cms,"The growing divide



AI Researchers: The new star athletes of tech



Culture vs. compensation



Winners and losers



The global race to hire the best AI talent is intensifying with each passing day. Now, a former OpenAI vice president has raised an alarm on the skyrocketing salaries and the pressure it is placing on traditional hiring models. As reported by Business Insider, in a recent podcast appearance, former OpenAI vice president Peter Dang said that escalating the battle to hire the top AI talent is now creating ripple effects which the HR departments can no longer ignore. “HR departments will have to address [it] at some point,” Deng said, pointing to the growing gap between AI researchers and other key contributors.As reported by Business Insider, Dang also emphasised that while a small number of top AI researchers are receiving huge pay packages and fast-moving offers, other employees who make important contributions to the company and to a particular product are now feeling less valued. This situation can lead to dissatisfaction and high turnover.“There are some people who are not researchers who feel like they're contributing a bunch to the product or the company or bringing a ton of value, but the discrepancy in salaries and RSUs and all that is becoming wider and wider,”, said Dang.Dang also added that AI researchers are now being treated as some star athletes. They are being seen as LeBron Jameses of Silicon Valley. Companies like OpenAI, Meta, Anthropic, xAI, and Perplexity have entered into an arms race. The companies are offering multimillion dollar compensations to lure talent from rival firms. Databricks VP of AI Naveen Rao even likened the recruitment frenzy to “looking for LeBron James.”As per the report, in one of hiring process tech giant Google shelled out $2.7 billion to acquire Character.ai, reportedly to bring back cofounder Noam Shazeer.Recently, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman also talked about negative impact of aggressive poaching practices and the highly inflated pay packages. In a conversation with his brother, Altman criticised the strategy of “upfront guaranteed comp” as potentially corrosive to company culture.“The strategy of a ton of upfront guaranteed comp and that being the reason you tell someone to join, like really the degree to which they're focusing on that and not the work and not the mission, I don't think that's going to set up a great culture,"" said Altman.”Despite all these challenges, Dang also believes that this intense competition is driving innovation and is also benefiting the investors and startup founders. “I trust the market,” Deng said. “It’s very clear that this research talent is so important to get right for each of these big labs.”","Former OpenAI vice president Peter Dang said that escalating the battle to hire the top AI talent is now creating ripple effects. “HR departments will have to address [it] at some point,” Deng said, pointing to the growing gap between AI researchers and other key contributors.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123575815,imgsize-208511,width-400,resizemode-4/ai-talent-war-ceos-battle-for-brains.jpg"

Details of the sunspot activity

On Tuesday evening, several of the year’s largest sunspots were spotted in the skies above Arar, drawing attention from astronomers to their size, visibility, and potential effects on Earth.Members of the Space and Astronomy Club confirmed that the sunspots visible this week included spots 4195, 4197, and 4199, each among the most significant recorded in 2025. According to club member Adnan Khalifah, these are temporary dark regions on the Sun’s surface formed by magnetic activity. Though they appear darker, they still emit light and remain highly radiant.Each sunspot observed measures tens of thousands of kilometers in diameter, with several exceeding the size of Earth multiple times over. They were visible through small telescopes equipped with safe solar filters, allowing both professional and amateur astronomers to track the phenomenon.Experts explained that sunspot activity is linked to solar flares and geomagnetic storms, which can interfere with satellite navigation systems and global communications. Monitoring these changes is critical to understanding the Sun’s 11-year solar cycle, which influences the frequency and intensity of such disturbances.Astronomers further emphasized that public observation and amateur contributions are essential, as they not only add to monitoring efforts but also encourage broader scientific awareness and interest in space research.","Sunspots 4195, 4197, and 4199 are among the most significant recorded in 2025.

A strategic start to Hajj 1447

Saudi Arabia has officially begun preparations for the 1447 AH (2026) Hajj season, just weeks after the conclusion of Hajj 2025. A high-level coordination meeting in Makkah, led by top regional officials and involving over 40 agencies, marked the launch of planning efforts aimed at enhancing services, integrating operations, and adopting technology to improve the pilgrim experience.Deputy Emir of Makkah, Prince Saud bin Mishaal bin Abdulaziz, officially inaugurated a high-level panel meeting focused on preparations for the 1447 AH Hajj season.
