Yes – They drive accountability and productivity No – They increase pressure and reduce flexibility





BENGALURU: TCS's updated associate deployment policy mandates employees to be billed for 225 days annually, restricting their bench time to a maximum of 35 business days each year. The policy aims to foster a proactive approach towards associate allocation, ensuring both organisational and individual goals are met.""At any given point in time, associates must be allocated for a minimum period of 225 business days in the last 12 months,"" the document reviewed by TOI showed. ""Long periods of remaining unallocated shall adversely impact associate compensation, career growth, avenues of overseas deployment in future, and continuity of employment with the organisation,"" it said. The new policy, which came into effect on June 12, was laid out by Chandrasekaran Ramkumar, global head of The Resource Management Group (RMG).RMG at TCS oversees workforce deployment, ensuring the right talent with the right skills is assigned to projects. This team focuses on maximising organisational utilisation by making sure every associate is optimally engaged and allocated to projects at all times.""In the event an associate is unallocated, it is the primary responsibility of the associate to proactively engage with the Unit / Regional RMG for seeking allocation and take initiative towards pursuing suitable opportunities provided by the organisation,"" the policy said.All associates who are released to RMG, available for the next assignment, and reporting to RMG are unallocated resources.TCS provides opportunities through platforms like iEvolve, Fresco Play, VLS, and LinkedIn. While unallocated, associates are expected to spend 4-6 hours daily on relevant learning via iEvolve, complete all mandatory and prioritised training, attend in-person sessions as recommended by RMG, and actively upskill to stay interview-ready. They should also use the Gen AI interview coach, review and address feedback from past interviews, and complete all training programmes on time with full attendance.To facilitate swift deployment, TCS has called out that physical presence in the office is mandatory. As a result, WFO exceptions and flexible work arrangements are generally not applicable. ""However, associates may request short-term flexible work options for personal emergencies in exceptional circumstances, subject to organisational policies and prior approval from the RMG.""TCS has stated that frequent short-term allocations to multiple projects are discouraged and may lead to HR investigations and appropriate disciplinary measures. An email sent to TCS on the policy didn't elicit a response till the time of going to the press.","TCS's updated associate deployment policy mandates employees to be billed for 225 days annually.

Iran-Israel conflict: How will blocking of Strait of Hormuz hit India? Indian refiners look at alternative routes for fuel supply,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/iran-israel-conflict-how-will-blocking-of-strait-of-hormuz-hit-india-indian-refiners-look-at-alternative-routes-for-fuel-supply/articleshow/121902819.cms,"The Strait of Hormuz serves as a crucial channel for worldwide energy transportation.

Israel Strikes Iranian Foreign Ministry Building; ‘IDF Missiles Hit Nuclear, Govt, & Energy Targets’

What is the Strait of Hormuz & why it matters

The Strait of Hormuz serves as a crucial channel for worldwide energy transportation. This strategic waterway, spanning just 29 nautical miles at its narrowest section, facilitates the movement of approximately one-third of maritime oil shipments and 20% of global liquefied natural gas.

The strategic significance of this passageway, which connects the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman and Arabian Sea, is emphasised by the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), which designates it as the ""world's most important oil chokepoint.""

The International Energy Agency (IEA) reports that in 2023, roughly 20 million barrels per day (mb/d) of crude oil and refined products traversed the Strait of Hormuz, accounting for about 30% of global oil commerce.

The majority of this volume—approximately 70%—was destined for Asian markets, with China, India and Japan being the primary destinations.

Although alternative pipeline networks are present, their capacity remains restricted.

According to IEA calculations, merely 4.2 mb/d of crude oil can be redirected through land-based routes, including Saudi Arabia's East-West pipeline to the Red Sea and the UAE's Abu Dhabi Crude Oil Pipeline to Fujairah. This available capacity constitutes just about one-fourth of the regular daily volume passing through the Strait.

Impact on India

Will the escalating Iran-Israel conflict cause an oil supply issue for India? Indian refiners are exploring alternative energy sources, including those from West African nations, to ensure fuel supply security in case Iran blocks the Strait of Hormuz amid escalating tensions with Israel, according to oil industry officials.Following the eruption of Iran-Israel tensions on Friday, senior oil ministry officials and industry leaders are conducting scenario analyses and preparing contingency plans for potential supply disruptions and price volatility.The oil ministry reports that India maintains crude oil and petroleum product storage facilities capable of meeting 74 days of domestic consumption requirements. The strategic petroleum reserves account for 9.5 days of this total capacity.Unlike its strategic crude reserves, India has not established gas storage facilities. Additionally, the government maintains confidentiality regarding national oil and gas inventory levels.Industry executives indicate that this overall storage capability includes stocks at refineries, pipeline networks, vessels in transit, product storage terminals, and vacant tanks suitable for storing both crude oil and refined products.A potential closure of the Strait of Hormuz could impact 40% of India's crude imports and 54% of its LNG supplies. This strait currently facilitates approximately 30% of global oil trade and 20% of LNG shipments.India's crude oil dependency on imports stands at 90%, with refineries heavily dependent on Gulf supplies. Russian imports constitute approximately 35%, Gulf nations contribute over 40%, whilst Africa, the US and other sources make up the balance. African imports declined to 5% in May from 12% in April.For 2024, India's LNG procurement from the Gulf region stands at 54%, with Qatar providing 80% and UAE supplying the remaining amount. Qatar, ranking amongst the top three global LNG exporters, maintains significant influence over worldwide gas supply. Any interruption to Qatari exports could trigger a surge in spot LNG prices.Also Read | Significant dent? How an escalating Iran-Israel conflict can threaten India’s growth story - explained Additionally, long-term LNG prices could increase, considering 60% of India's long-term agreements are connected to crude oil rates.However, industry executives from Indian refining and gas companies express scepticism about Iran implementing a blockade, based on historical precedents. They suggest that such an action would likely trigger substantial price increases and direct US intervention, whilst also adversely affecting Gulf nations and oil-dependent countries.Additionally, executives note that blocking the strait would disrupt both Gulf exports and essential imports, including Iran's own trade, which serves as a significant deterrent.Currently, Indian refiners are maintaining their normal purchasing patterns without resorting to 'panic buying'.Also Read | Iran-Israel conflict impact: Basmati rice prices to drop as exports to Iran, third largest buyer of Indian basmati, expected to decline While contingency plans exist, an executive told ET that ""closure of the strait would shrink the global pool of available oil and gas. No matter how carefully you prepare, every economy would feel the impact of a supply crunch and price spike."" Another executive highlighted the situation's intricacy, stating, ""If India turns to West Africa for additional supplies, other importers are likely to follow.""The international LNG trade lacks the maturity and flexibility seen in oil markets, with few options for supply diversification. The 2022 energy crisis highlighted this vulnerability when a former Gazprom subsidiary defaulted on its LNG delivery commitments to India's GAIL, compelling the company to reduce supplies to domestic consumers.","The Strait of Hormuz serves as a crucial channel for worldwide energy transportation.

After sparring with the Tamil Nadu govt over the antiquity of archaeological finds at Keeladi, the Union govt has removed Amarnath Ramakrishna as ASI director (antiquity). Ramakrishna had submitted a report that said the south Tamil Nadu finds were from the 8th century BCE.After Union culture minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat said on June 10 that the Keeladi report was not scientifically sound, TN chief minister M K Stalin criticised the Centre, saying it's not the report but some mindsets that need to be changed. Tamil Nadu's govt had revived archaeological excavations in the state to further its narrative of Dravidian glory of yore.ASI director (exploration & excavation) Hemasagar A Naik, who sent a letter to Amarnath on May 21 seeking ""concrete justification"" for the dating of the Keeladi findings - and received a sharp response from Ramakrishna - will now head the antiquities department. Ramakrishna will remain in charge of the National Mission on Monuments and Antiquities (NMMA). Sources said NMMA, set up by the govt in 2007 to create two national registers to document monuments and antiquities across the country, has been virtually defunct.On May 23, Ramakrishna replied to Naik's letter stating that the period of Keeladi excavation ""was reconstructed as per the stratigraphical sequence, cultural deposit available with material culture, and with accelerator mass spectrometry"".He added, ""The final outcome of the observation of the excavator was incorporated in the final report with all documentary evidence, and the chronological sequence of the Keeladi site was clearly explained in the report. ""In his letter, Naik said, ""The date of the earlier period (8thcentury BCE to 5th century BCE) in the present state of our knowledge appears to be very early and that it can be, at the maximum, somewhere in pre-300 BCE.""Ramakrishna was firm in his reply: ""The view expressed by you for further examination of sequence is against the well-reasoned conclusive finding of the excavator of the site.""To Naik's observation that ""only mentioning the depth for the available scientific dates is not enough but the layer number should also be marked for comparative consistency analysis"", Ramakrishna replied, ""Layer numbering will be done if it is found missing."" Finally, on Naik's insistence that the submitted maps may be replaced with better ones, that the village map lacked clarity, some plates were missing, drawings were missing, and trenches/cuttings required, Ramakrishna replied that ""all relevant maps, plates and drawings were given in high resolution format"".Recently, Shekhawat had said the report on Keeladi submitted by Ramakrishna was not ""technically well-supported"" and more data was required. ""The report is not technically well-supported and established yet. A lot of things are to be done before recognition and accreditation are accorded to the findings presented by the archaeologist.

AHMEDABAD: A doctor's emotional plea for time to vacate the crash-damaged quarters near BJ Medical College struck a chord online early Saturday. The video showed Anil Panwar, a cardiac anaesthetist at UN Mehta Institute of Cardiology and Research Centre (UNMICRC), describing the difficulty of relocating while tending to an unwell child.Even as the appeal garnered widespread concern and sympathy, Dr Panwar posted a second video, clarifying that his earlier remarks were made in a moment of stress and that his family had, in fact, been provided accommodation. BJMC authorities, meanwhile, confirmed that all junior doctors and faculty members who were displaced have been allotted new accommodation.The initial video, filmed on Friday night near the residential quarters, showed Dr Panwar standing among packed belongings, his voice trembling as he spoke of the urgency and pressure to vacate. He said the administration had asked them to vacate the quarters immediately as they planned to demolish parts of the buildings as part of the relief and rescue work.""Are we not humans? Can't you give us 2-3 days? We need some basic goods to run the house. Several of our doctors are admitted (to the hospital for treatment). We are troubled... Understand that it is not easy to clear a house overnight,"" said Dr Panwar, who was covered in soot from attempting to shift his belongings.He was on duty when the tragedy took place.""I pray to you with folded hands that give us 2-3 days' time. My child is admitted, and I should be with her. Instead, I am here (at the site, clearing belongings). Convey my message to the higher-ups as I am helpless. I am not from Gujarat, and I need some time to shift,"" he said. His wife, Dr Chanchal Bhandari, also a cardiac anaesthetist, had grabbed attention a day ago when news broke out of how her heroism and her nanny's presence of mind helped them save her two-year-old daughter's life after the ill-fated plane crashed onto the hostel buildings.The appeal, shared widely across social media platforms, drew empathy and concern from citizens and medical professionals alike, many of whom highlighted the psychological and physical toll the crash had taken on healthcare workers already coping with long shifts and trauma.However, by Saturday afternoon, Dr Panwar issued a second statement. In a video message, he said that the earlier remarks were made in a moment of stress and confusion, and that he had not been aware that his wife — also a doctor — had already been allotted temporary housing by hospital authorities ""I was mentally disturbed and didn't know what I was saying,"" he said. ""Volunteers helped us shift our belongings. I again thank the hospital and government authorities,"" he said in the video.The clarification came as the BJ Medical College administration announced that a total of 159 accommodations had been arranged for residents from the damaged hostels and staff quarters.Dr Minakshi Parikh, dean of BJMC, said that 100 students from Atulyam 2 and 3 had been moved to the GCRI Old Block and Digvijaya Lions Hostel. Another 38 residents from Atulyam 1 were relocated to PG Hostel wings ON MediCity campus, the Mithila quarters, and the UN Mehta hostel. Twenty-one residents from Atulyam 4 were shifted to the Dental College quarters and Mithila 2 quarters. ""All affected students and residents have been shifted to new accommodations as of Saturday,"" she confirmed.Some junior doctors, speaking anonymously, acknowledged that the shifting process was not without hurdles as the relief and rescue work was going on all around. ""Almost all of us were reporting to duty due to the scale of the catastrophe. But one can understand that the authorities are also pressed on multiple fronts. The seniors and staffers also helped us, and almost all have now been shifted to new accommodations,"" said a doctor. Several voluntary organizations are providing meals and other help to the affected residents, said officials.","Anil Panwar, a cardiac anaesthetist at UN Mehta Institute of Cardiology and Research Centre, made emotional plea for time to vacate quarters near BJ Medical College.

BENGALURU: Over 100 bike taxis were seized across Bengaluru on Monday as enforcement agencies cracked down on aggregators flouting a recent Karnataka HC directive halting such operations.The ban came into force Monday following the HC declining to stay an earlier govt order prohibiting bike taxi services. While companies, including Rapido and Uber , claimed compliance, officials reported that several platforms continued to operate, prompting action by the transport offices.Transport minister Ramalinga Reddy said some aggregators were circumventing the court order by using parcel delivery services as a cover.

MUMBAI: Days after the newly opened Vikhroli rail overbridge (ROB) was opened to traffic to improve east-west connectivity, motorists are questioning key design choices. Why does a two-way bridge have only three lanes and no central divider? Why are there no footpaths?The absence of footpaths is a continuing trend seen in several recently reconstructed bridges across the city, say residents.Bridges like Delisle Road (Lower Parel) and Gokhale (Andheri), rebuilt in recent years, lack adequate pedestrian space — a stark contrast to their British-era predecessors, which featured wide footpaths used daily by thousands of pedestrians. Though the fully commissioned Gokhale bridge includes a footpath, its width is significantly reduced compared to the original.An official from the bridges department said that the width of the bridge at Vikhroli is 12 metres and the three-lane carriageway was as per the earlier general administrative drawing (GAD).Former Congress corporator Sheetal Mhatre was among the people who questioned the lane arrangement. ""Is it one lane for each direction, with the middle lane reserved on a first-come, fast-come basis?"" Mhatre said.A resident said it took seven years to build the 615-metre-long bridge yet it lacked a few important interventions like footpaths and dividers. ""When you enter from Vikhroli (West), there's no option to take a right turn towards Tagore Nagar at the exit — you're forced to make a full U-turn.Even the cat reflectors on the bridge have already gone missing in some places,"" the resident said.It was on the evening of June 14 that the BMC opened the Vikhroli bridge without any official inauguration. The work order for the bridge works was issued in 2018. Owing to land acquisition issues and pandemic-induced lockdowns, the work on the bridge was delayed, said civic officials.","The absence of footpaths is a continuing trend seen in several recently reconstructed bridges across the city, say residents.

Black Box recovered for Air India Boeing 787-7 Dreamliner

India’s New AC Rule: Cooling Between 20°C–28°C Explained

An Air India Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner carrying 242 people crashed shortly after takeoff from Ahmedabad airport on June 12, killing 241 on board and dozens on the ground. Among the uproar, a tweet from Tesla CEO and X owner Elon Musk has resurfaced, in which he criticized Boeing’s management structure. In his post, Elon Musk said: “Although Boeing got $4.2 billion to develop an astronaut capsule and SpaceX only got $2.6 billion, SpaceX finished 4 years sooner. Note, the crew capsule design of Dragon 2 has almost nothing in common with Dragon 1. Too many non‑technical managers at Boeing.”Elon Musk’s post then highlighted Boeing’s $4.2 billion investment in the Starliner spacecraft, contrasting it with SpaceX’s (owned by Elon Musk) $2.6 billion for the Dragon 2, which completed four years earlier despite a near-complete redesign. His post hinted at inefficiencies in Boeing’s management structure as also reported in a 2023 NASA audit on commercial crew program cost overruns.In the aftermath of the deadly crash, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has directed all Boeing Dreamliner 787/9 fleet of Air India equipped with Genx engines to undergo additional maintenance and safety checks with immediate effect in coordination with the concerned regional DGCA offices.

What Anthropic CEO said on AI

Anthropic on Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's statement

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang expressed sharp disagreement with Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei ’s predictions about AI-driven job automation during a press briefing at VivaTech in Paris. Huang specifically challenged Amodei’s recent claim that AI could eliminate up to 50% of entry-level white-collar jobs within five years, dismissing the notion as overly alarmist.“I pretty much disagree with almost everything [Amodei] says,” Huang stated, critiquing three key points he attributed to Amodei: that AI is so dangerous only a select few should develop it, that it’s too costly for widespread development, and that its power will lead to massive job losses. “If you want things to be done safely and responsibly, you do it in the open … Don’t do it in a dark room and tell me it’s safe,” Huang added, advocating for transparent and collaborative AI development.Amodei, in a recent Axios interview, had warned that AI could disrupt half of entry-level office roles and urged policymakers to prepare for economic impacts. Huang countered that while AI will transform jobs, it will also create new opportunities, citing increased productivity as a driver for hiring. “Some jobs will be obsolete, but many jobs are going to be created,” he said.In response, an Anthropic spokesperson clarified to Fortune that Amodei has never claimed only Anthropic should build AI. “Dario has advocated for a national transparency standard for AI developers … so the public and policymakers are aware of the models’ capabilities and risks,” the statement read. The spokesperson reaffirmed Amodei’s concerns about AI’s economic impact and his commitment to addressing them.Anthropic, founded in 2021 by Amodei and other ex-OpenAI researchers, prioritizes safety in AI development, a focus rooted in the founders’ reported concerns over OpenAI’s direction. The public clash between Huang and Amodei highlights ongoing debates in the AI industry about its societal and economic implications.","Jensen Huang expressed sharp disagreement with Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei ’s predictions about AI-driven job automation during a press briefing at VivaTech in Paris.

The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has raised concerns that it could take away jobs, especially entry-level roles. But Reid Hoffman, co-founder of LinkedIn believes that young people should not fear AI. Instead, they should use it to their advantage while job hunting. In a video he published on his YouTube channel this week, Reid Hoffman said, ""You are generation AI. You are AI native. So bringing the fact that you have AI in your tool set is one of the things that makes you enormously attractive”.Reid Hoffman was responding to questions from college students, many of whom were worried about their job prospects in the AI age. He admitted those fears are valid, but encouraged students to flip the script.“Yes, it’s changing the workplace and creating confusion for employers,” he said. “But it also gives you a chance to show your unique abilities. In teams with older professionals, you might even be the one helping them understand new tools,” Reid Hoffman stated.Dario Amodei, CEO of AI company Anthropic, recently warned that AI could eliminate up to half of all entry-level office jobs in the next five years. He said this could cause unemployment to rise by 10% to 20%, and added, “Most people don’t realize this is about to happen.”But top tech figures like Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and investor Mark Cuban strongly disagreed with Amodei’s view. Speaking at VivaTech 2025, Huang said: “I pretty much disagree with almost everything he says. AI will definitely change jobs — it changed mine — but it will also create new ones.”Cuban echoed the same sentiment in a recent social media post, pointing out that even in the past, roles like secretaries and in-office dictation staff were replaced by technology, but new industries and jobs emerged.“AI will lead to new companies and increase total employment,” he wrote in the post.","LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman believes young people should not fear AI.

Andhra Pradesh’s landmark 1987 Act: Birth of structured yoga education in India; Prime Minister Narendra Modi to attend International Yoga Day event in Vizag on June 21,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/visakhapatnam/andhra-pradeshs-landmark-1987-act-birth-of-structured-yoga-education-in-india-prime-minister-narendra-modi-to-attend-international-yoga-day-event-in-vizag-on-june-21/articleshow/121921958.cms,"Act was the first dedicated, yoga-specific legislative initiative in any Indian state

It created Yogadhyayana Parishad as a statutory body with extensive authority over curriculum, examinations, research, and institutional oversight

By formalising curriculum guidelines, the Act eliminated inconsistencies in yoga education previously shaped by individual institutions

The Act positioned yoga not just as a cultural practice but as a tool for disease prevention and holistic well-being

It encouraged evidence-based research in yoga and naturopathy, contributing to the modernisation of traditional health systems

The framework was designed to be robust yet adaptable, serving as a potential model for other states or even countries

The Act contributed both to improving public health outcomes and preserving India’s cultural heritage

Though repealed in 1990, the Act’s foundational approach to structured yoga education continues to influence policy and professional standards in India





VISAKHAPATNAM: Andhra Pradesh will take centre stage on June 21, when Visakhapatnam hosts the International Yoga Day celebrations, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi attending as the chief guest.The event also highlights the state’s historical role in the formalisation of yoga education, a legacy that dates back to 1987.Former chief minister NT Rama Rao’s second term (1985-89) was marked by a conscious appeal to Telugu cultural pride, and the Andhra Pradesh Yogadhyayana Parishad Act, 1987 (Act 25 of 1987) fitted neatly into that narrative. By legislating an autonomous ‘Parishad’ dedicated to yoga and naturopathy, NTR moved these disciplines from the realm of private ashrams and short-term courses into the formal education structure.The Act’s preamble explicitly positions yoga not merely as heritage but as a public health instrument, signalling a state-centric, welfare-oriented approach rather than a purely cultural one.Historically, the practices of yoga in India, while deeply ingrained in cultural and spiritual traditions, often lacked a formalised structure for education and professional accreditation. Teaching methodologies and standards varied widely, typically relying on lineage-based instruction or individual institutional discretion.This informal landscape presented challenges in ensuring consistent quality, professional recognition, and public trust. The 1987 Act emerged as a transformative measure to address this gap.While national bodies like the Central Council for Research in Yoga & Naturopathy (1995) would take a broader mandate later, Andhra Pradesh’s 1987 experiment offered a template — legislative recognition, university linkage, and fiscal support.Interestingly, while the state health minister served as the chairman of the governing council of the Parishad, the vice-chancellor of the (Dr NTR) University of Health Sciences in Vijayawada was the vice-chairman.Before Andhra Pradesh enacted the Yogadhyayana Parishad Act in 1987, no other Indian state had introduced a yoga-specific statute for higher education. Earlier initiatives in states such as Gujarat, Bihar, Delhi, and Karnataka operated either as depts within existing universities or as private or centrally administered societies, rather than through state legislation.AP Yogadhyayana Parishad Act formalised yoga education in three key ways. First, it introduced a standardised curriculum and certification process, eliminating the inconsistencies of guru-issued diplomas. Second, by granting the Parishad oversight over funding and institutional inspections, it established a quality-control framework and ensured stable financial support for yoga schools.Third, its mandatory affiliation with the Health University integrated yoga pedagogy into mainstream education, fostering cross-disciplinary research, shared libraries, and clinical internships, an early example of state-level integrative medicine policy.Despite these advancements, the model had its limitations, particularly in centralised decision-making, which restricted its outreach beyond Hyderabad. Ultimately, the 1987 Act was repealed in 1990 following a change in regime. However, in a high-power committee meeting held in March 1990, it was resolved to maintain the institutions created under the Parishad.Even though the Act was short-lived, it successfully transformed yoga from a cultural practice into an examinable, research-driven academic discipline. The Act also laid the groundwork for India’s contemporary Ayush framework nearly a decade before its formal inception.AP Yogadhyayana Parishad Act, 1987","The Andhra Pradesh Yogadhyayana Parishad Act, 1987 (Act 25 of 1987) was the first dedicated, yoga-specific legislative initiative in any Indian state.

Quantum cryptography research

Typical global capability centres (GCCs) focus on delivering services to support global operations. Here’s one with a difference. French identity and security solutions provider Idemia’s India operations not only support services, but also manufactures payment and connectivity products including payment cards, subscriber identity module (SIM) cards for smartphones, and chips that go into security and payment devices globally. These are chips embedded on credit, debit and other payment cards, and even driving licences.The GCC supports internal operations such as HR and finance, it plays a crucial role in R&D, and delivers comprehensive support to global customers across banking, fintech, telecom, utilities, public services, security agencies, and more.Matthew Foxton, regional president at Idemia, says they established the GCC at Noida in 2004, when there were no similar centres focused on chip card development. “We created an indigenous operating system for SIM cards, driving licenses and vehicle registration certificates. This has now matured and India is a global hub for us for services, R&D and manufacturing,” he says.There are around 5,000 employees in India, and the centre is the company’s largest hub outside Europe. Around 1,500 of the employees are in three manufacturing units in Noida, located at the Noida Special Economic Zone (SEZ). Idemia also has a service centre in Mumbai.Within the Noida SEZ, three facilities churn out SIM cards, chips embedded in payment cards, biometric devices and handheld scanners that are used across global markets – by global telcos, airports, banks, fintech companies and even gover nment agencies. Customers include the likes of Westpac Banking Corporation, Amex, HSBC, Boeing, SK Telecom, Deutsche Telecom, and KT Corporation. Noida also has a unit that’s into packaging chips directly from wafers.The GCC is also a global research hub, driving innovation in post-quantum cryptography or PQC, facial recognition, eSIMs, and more. PQC is the development of cryptographic algorithms that are resistant to attacks by quantum computers.In 2024, Idemia entered into a collaboration with IIT Hyderabad to develop solutions to future-proof digital security against quantum-enabled cyber threats. “Post-quantum cryptography is about developing encryption standards that can withstand quantum computing attacks. And India is at the centre of this effort,” says Foxton.The team here is also working to perfect AI-driven security solutions like face recognition algorithms. The effort is to recognise faces even if the person is wearing a mask.This ability to integrate both high-tech research and handson production has made Idemia India indispensable to the company’s global ambitions. The India GCC, Foxton says, plays a strategic role in powering global innovation and product roadmap. “Our India centre contributes across our entire product portfolio – from mobile SIMs and green payment cards (ecofriendly, made from recycled materials) to biometric access devices and border control systems,” he says.At least 10 innovators from the India team have been granted patents for their work in security and identity domains. Foxton says that as AI and quantum computing reshape digital security, the India team is expected to play a pivotal role in defining what’s next in security.","Idemia’s India operations not only support services, but also manufactures payment cards, subscriber identity module (SIM) cards for smartphones, and chips that go into security and payment devices globally.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive.

During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

What’s Next? More Airbus Orders May Follow

More A350s, to complement the airline’s current dominance in that model.





Airbus A330-900s, a potential replacement for its aging A330-200s and A330-300s.









In late May 2025, Qatar Airways made the strategic decision to cancel its order for 25 Boeing 737 MAX 10s, a move confirmed by CEO Badr Mohammed Al Meer in an interview with Bloomberg. a move that not only ends its short-lived venture into the type but also reshapes the airline’s entire narrowbody strategy. The order, which also included options for 25 more, was placed during the 2022 Farnborough Airshow, a time when the airline’s relationship with Airbus was at an all-time low, the deal was positioned as a solution for the airline’s regional network, with Boeing Commercial Airplanes’ then-CEO Stan Deal praising the aircraft as ""ideally suited for Qatar Airways' regional network.""But two years later, delays in the 737 MAX 10’s certification, which has pushed its expected entry into commercial service to 2026 at the earliest, have forced the airline to reconsider. Qatar Airways is not alone in facing these setbacks, major carriers like United Airlines, American Airlines, and Delta Air Lines are also waiting, with growing frustration.In fact, United’s Chief Commercial Officer, Andrew Nocella, told Reuters that the 737 MAX 10 isn’t expected to arrive before 2027 or even 2028, and the airline is now hesitant to convert any MAX 9 orders into MAX 10s.“We want to see the aircraft certified before we make the firm commitment,” Nocella said.Qatar Airways, meanwhile, opted to walk away entirely.Qatar’s move to order the 737 MAX 10s in 2022 wasn’t born purely of performance metrics, it was a response to an escalating legal and commercial dispute with Airbus. That year, Qatar Airways grounded all 29 of its Airbus A350s, citing what it described as ""accelerated surface degradation"" of the aircraft’s painted fuselage.In response, the airline filed a lawsuit seeking $600 million in damages from Airbus and publicly challenged the safety and airworthiness of the A350 fleet. Airbus, while acknowledging cosmetic and surface issues, insisted the aircraft were structurally safe and continued deliveries to other customers.During this high-profile conflict:At the peak of the fallout, the Boeing 737 MAX 10 was pulled in to fill that gap, offering Qatar Airways an alternative narrowbody solution as it severed ties, temporarily, with Airbus.But in early 2023, the feud reached a resolution. Both parties issued a joint statement announcing that the matter had been settled amicably:""Qatar Airways and Airbus are pleased to have reached an amicable and mutually agreeable settlement in relation to their legal dispute over A350 surface degradation and the grounding of A350 aircraft. A repair project is now underway and both parties look forward to getting these aircraft safely back in the air.""Following this, Qatar reinstated the order for 50 A321neos, and Airbus resumed delivery plans for the grounded A350s. The settlement not only restored fleet development plans but reset the tone of the Qatar-Airbus relationship.Qatar Airways’ Chief Executive Officer Badr Mohammed Al Meer, in an interview with, confirmed the airline had dropped the MAX 10 order, which also included options for 25 more aircraft. This decision, he revealed, was made in conjunction with a massive new Boeing widebody order that dwarfs the value of the narrowbody deal.Earlier this month, Qatar Airways placed its largest-ever aircraft order, agreeing to purchase 130 Boeing 787 Dreamliners and 30 Boeing 777-9s, with options for an additional 50 aircraft, a potential total of 210 widebodies valued at $96 billion.Responding to whether the airline was playing Boeing and Airbus against each other, Al Meer toldFrancine Lacqua:“You know, for the time being, we need to focus on finalizing our agreement with Boeing. As you saw, we are not like other airlines where we split our orders 20 today, 20 next year. Because we are basing our order on a very solid strategy and we decided to go with the 210 aircraft order. However, it doesn’t mean that Airbus is out of the game. Our narrowbodies will continue to be Airbus.”In a separate public comment, Al Meer reiterated the airline’s direction:“Our narrowbody [fleet] will continue to be Airbus. We are receiving 50 A321neos starting next year. So our whole narrowbody fleet will be basically operated by Airbus. We continue to receive A350-1000s, and there will always be a chance for another order from Airbus.”As of now, Qatar Airways operates a limited narrowbody fleet consisting of:Several MAX 8s previously operated by Qatar Airways have already been leased to IndiGo for routes between Qatar and India. The remaining three are expected to be phased out soon, aligning with the airline’s plan to standardize its narrowbody fleet around Airbus.Qatar Airways is already the largest operator of the Airbus A350-1000 globally. The aircraft typically features two configurations:In the years ahead, the airline will boast one of the most modern widebody fleets in the world, operating from its hub at Doha Hamad International Airport (DOH).While Boeing has secured a record-breaking widebody order, there’s speculation that Qatar Airways may also return to Airbus for additional widebodies. Possibilities include:Qatar Airways' renewed ties with Airbus open the door for future deals, as the airline looks to refine and expand its fleet under a disciplined, long-term strategy. The airline is clearly not chasing diversification for its own sake, it's targeting operational efficiency, flexibility, and strategic alignment with its growth ambitions.As for Boeing, with a growing backlog of 737 MAX 10 orders, the manufacturer now faces intensifying pressure to resolve regulatory hurdles that have kept the aircraft grounded in the certification process. The delays are prompting several major carriers to reconsider their long-term fleet strategies. Qatar Airways is not alone in stepping back from the MAX 10; United Airlines, one of the aircraft’s largest customers, has expressed deep concerns over delivery timelines. American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, and Alaska Airlines, all with MAX 10 orders in the pipeline, are also closely watching the certification timeline, with some reportedly exploring alternative options or reconfiguring existing commitments.","Qatar Airways cancelled its remaining order for 23 Airbus A350s.

MUMBAI: In the corner of a school corridor in south Kolkata, a retired Sanskrit teacher quietly takes a class without pay. Down the hallway, a part-time Hindi teacher, paid just Rs 5,000 a month, juggles syllabi and student disinterest.These are not isolated cases — they are scenes repeating across campuses of India, where the three-language formula of the National Education Policy (NEP) is a muddled mosaic of politics, policy and pedagogy.The idea is simple on paper: every child in India should learn three languages — preferably the mother tongue, Hindi or English, and one more Indian language. But in practice, the “third language” is often the orphaned child of the curriculum — chronically underfunded, sporadically taught, rarely enjoyed.NEP recommended three languages to promote “multilingualism, national unity, and cognitive development.” The policy says: “The three languages learned by children will be the choices of states, regions, and of the students themselves, so long as at least two of the three languages are native to India.”In essence, the policy is designed to “balance local relevance with national cohesion and global readiness”. However, linguist Peggy Mohan says, “Not only does it not help, we don’t have teachers to teach it.They are already overstressed with understanding English texts. Language is not an intellectual accomplishment. People learn languages if demanded by their environment. As usual politicians are loading their issues onto children. ”In West Bengal, where the State Education Policy was introduced as a counterweight to the Centre’s NEP, the third language begins in Class 5 — if schools can ﬁnd someone to teach it. Hindi or Sanskrit is usually the choice for Classes 7 and 8, or in some cases Urdu, but few institutions allocate full-time teachers for them. So principals improvise.“We employ a retired Sanskrit teacher on an honorary basis and a part-time Hindi teacher,” says Amit Sen Majumder of Jodhpur Park Boys’ School in south Kolkata. However, the pay can be as little as Rs 5,000.Keeping students engaged and convincing parents is equally a daunting task. Anjana Dutta, whose son is in Class 7 at a south Kolkata school, said, “Students are reluctant to study a third language, knowing it’s only for two years. Govt should ensure proper teaching and offer language options that could be useful later.”Incidentally, Bengali is taught compulsorily from Class 1. And while ASER (Annual Status of Education Report) 2024 paints a picture of improvement in the state — 71.3% of Class 8 students can read a Class 2-level text — parents are not entirely impressed with the standards.In Bihar, the formula includes Hindi, English and Sanskrit or Urdu — but again, the approach smacks of lip service. “Some schools have students without teachers; others have teachers without students,” admits ManojKumar, working president, State Primary Teachers’ Association. It’s not surprising, as sanctioned posts for language teachers has not kept pace with increase in students.Retired Patna University teacher and Sahitya Akademi Award winner Arun Kamal points out that studentshere mostly opt for Sanskrit as third language besides Hindi and English. Even as there is a facility for Bengali teaching in some schools, there are very few teachers for the subject. “We don’t offer enough options. There is no imaginative engagement.”Even Maithili, which is spoken in 148assembly constituencies and has been included in the 8th Schedule of the Constitution, is not taught in schools as yet. Linguist Bhairav Lal Das says Maithili is a popular language with a rich history but has not yet been made the medium of instruction even in the Mithilanchal (Maithili belt) of the state. “The education system hasn’t caught up with the linguistic richness of the state,” says Das.Yet, paradoxically, Bihar’s reading outcomes have improved: 41.2% of Class 5 students can now read Class 2-level texts. Numbers rise, but the languages dwindle.Here, in the country’s most populous state, Urdu and Sanskrit are taught from classes 5 to 8 in private schools and is mandatory for classes 6 to 8 in govt- and govt-aided inter colleges. In some, govt students can even choose to study Sanskrit till Class 12.Students opting for Sanskrit are limited though. Most tend to regard Sanskrit as merely a subject to clear in exams. Teachers, however, note that Urdu learning is more widespread because of its use in the literary world. “In our college, we have 15 Urdu learners in a class of 40. They come from all communities,” says Mirza Shaﬁq Husain Shafaq, an Urdu teacher in Lucknow. His class sometimes drifts into poetry and shayari.Recruitment of teachers is hard, though. “We get many science and commerce teachers,” says Anil Agarwal of St Joseph Institutions. “But, for Sanskrit or Urdu, barely anyone applies.” According to educators and administrators in UP, the challenge is in recruiting postgraduate teachers for Sanskrit and Urdu, as few opt for higher studies in these languages.Agarwal says continuous professional development through workshops, conferences, and online courses would address the shortage. Mentorship programmes to connect experienced educators with newcomers and collaboration by govt bodies with academic institutions in creating policies, he said, would create a conducive environment for teaching these languages.In Belagavi, the children speak Kannada, Marathi, Urdu — but not Hindi. “It feels out of place,” says award-winningteacher Hema Idagal. “They can’t grasp it because they don’t hear it.”In Mangaluru, efforts to preserve Tulu and Konkani as third languages are an act of devotion, not policy. Tulu is offered in around 40 schools, but Konkani Academy, footing the salary bill, has no formal funding for it. Konkani’s journey is steeper still — just four to ﬁve schools now teach it, mostly in Devanagari.“People ask, why teach what they already speak?” says Joachim Stany Alvares of the academy. “But if English speakers learn English, why not formalise our own?”Even students who love Tulu ﬁnd no continuation in pre-university education, making the choice impractical. “We offer it out of love,” says Dinesh Shettigar, Tulu teacher and drawing instructor, who worries what will happen after his retirement.Here, teaching the third language begins right from Class 1 — at least in policy. Teachers, however, are reeling from the shock. “It was never in the original foundational education plan,” says Mahendra Ganpule, ex-vice president of the State Headmasters’ Association. “Then suddenly we were told it must be taught — but with no extra teachers.”In Marathi-medium schools, English is a challenge; in English-medium schools, it’s Marathi. A third language, usually Hindi, simply compounds the confusion. The state recently made Marathi compulsory across all schools till Class 10. Hindi, initially mandated till Class 5, was made optional after protests.ASER data shows that in 2024, 50.3% of rural students could read a Class 2 text — down from 2018. English reading proﬁciency remains dire: just 12.1% of Class 5 students could read basic sentences in 2022. “Hiring depends on how many students opt for a language,” says Zafar Khan, a headmasters’ association president. “No takers, no teachers.”For a country that prides itself on linguistic diversity, our classrooms echo the opposite. Third languages are a constitutional promise, a pedagogical gift — but, increasingly, an administrative burden, experts say. Prof Madri Kakoti of Lucknow University offers a hopeful note. “Multiple languages don’t just build neural pathways. They connect us to each other. To learn a third language is to increase cultural understanding between our people, expose our children to the traditions of neighbouring states and their people, and encourage a whole new generation towards humanities and literature. ”But, for that to happen, it must ﬁrst be taught with purpose — not as a policy checkbox, but as a bridge between a child’s tongue and the world.In the corner of a school corridor in south Kolkata, a retired Sanskrit teacher quietly takes a class without pay.

Hindi, initially mandated till Class 5, was made optional after protests.ASER data shows that in 2024, 50.3% of rural students could read a Class 2 text — down from 2018. English reading proﬁciency remains dire: just 12.1% of Class 5 students could read basic sentences in 2022. “Hiring depends on how many students opt for a language,” says Zafar Khan, a headmasters’ association president. “No takers, no teachers.”For a country that prides itself on linguistic diversity, our classrooms echo the opposite. Third languages are a constitutional promise, a pedagogical gift — but, increasingly, an administrative burden, experts say. Prof Madri Kakoti of Lucknow University offers a hopeful note. “Multiple languages don’t just build neural pathways. They connect us to each other. To learn a third language is to increase cultural understanding between our people, expose our children to the traditions of neighbouring states and their people, and encourage a whole new generation towards humanities and literature. ”But, for that to happen, it must ﬁrst be taught with purpose — not as a policy checkbox, but as a bridge between a child’s tongue and the world.","The idea is simple on paper: every child in India should learn three languages — preferably the mother tongue, Hindi or English, and one more Indian language. But in practice, the ‘third language’ is often the orphaned child of the curriculum — chronically underfunded, rarely enjoyed.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121921548,imgsize-2140389,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/121921548.jpg"

Dubai has officially reintroduced its seasonal workplace initiative, ‘Our Flexible Summer’, offering government employees flexible working hours aimed at boosting productivity and enhancing work-life balance during the scorching summer period.The Dubai Government Human Resources Department (DGHR) confirmed that the initiative will run from July 1 to September 12, 2025, and will apply across government entities at each department’s discretion. This follows a successful pilot conducted in 2024.“This is all about supporting a better work-life balance for our government teams,” the DGHR said in a public statement, highlighting the initiative’s aim to make summer “a little cooler” for public sector staff.Under the temporary model, the standard five-day workweek remains in place, but employees can choose from two flexible scheduling options:The choice of implementation is left to each government department, allowing flexibility across different operations.The DGHR stated that the initiative “comes after the successful trial run earlier this year” and is intended to increase employee happiness and overall productivity during the UAE’s peak summer months.The program isn’t new.

The new schedule will allow some staff to enjoy a full three-day weekend, depending on the group selected.In parallel, the UAE continues to implement additional summer workforce protections, particularly for outdoor and field-based workers.As of June 15, the Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation (MoHRE) began enforcing the annual midday break, which bans work under direct sunlight from 12:30 PM to 3:00 PM, daily until September 15.MoHRE inspectors have already begun site checks, with fines of Dh5,000 per worker for violations, up to a maximum of Dh50,000 in cases involving multiple breaches.In addition, the ministry has set up over 10,000 air-conditioned rest stations across the country to support delivery service workers, helping them cope with extreme heat during the peak season.","'Our Flexible Summer' initiative will run from July 1 to September 12, 2025.
