Confirmation of Ahmedabad as the host city for the 2030 Commonwealth Games (CWG) has sounded the starting gun for an accelerated infrastructure race across the Ahmedabad-Gandhinagar belt. The Commonwealth Sport General Assembly’s approval on Wednesday has pushed the twin cities into delivery mode, with officials stressing that major venue construction plans are locked into a firm timeline.Speaking to the media in Glasgow after Ahmedabad won hosting rights, Gujarat principal secretary (sports, youth and cultural activities) Ashwani Kumar said that the city is poised to be the sports capital of India. “The construction of the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Sports Enclave (SVPSE) and the Police Academy Sports Hub will begin in April 2026 and finish by late 2028 or early 2029,” he said.He announced that funding for both these projects had been secured by the govt and that “most venues for the 2030 Games are ready”. He also said that the “organising committee will be constituted within a month”.Much of the Games’ footprint will be centred on the SVPSE — a purpose-built zone that will anchor Gujarat’s longterm sporting ecosystem.The enclave will house an arena, aquatic centre, tennis courts, training zones, and athlete villages. The Karai Police Academy complex will host athletics, shooting and other disciplines. For Gujarat, the CWG is as much about global visibility as about creating infrastructural and sporting capacity that endures beyond 2030.Unlike some sporting meets that span multiple states, the 2030 Games will be strikingly compact, concentrated almost entirely within the Ahmedabad-Gandhinagar cluster. That will enable faster movement and a lower carbon footprint. “This compactness cuts athlete travel time and allows seamless integration of metro, BRTS and electric mobility,” states the document, ‘Games Vision, Concept and Legacy — Commonwealth Games 2030’, presented before the CWG committee. Only two disciplines — cycling at the Statue of Unity (near Kevadia) and women’s cricket in Vadodara — will take place outside this hub.The Narendra Modi Stadium, the world’s largest cricket stadium, will host the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2030 Games — massive productions that are expected to reflect the Commonwealth Sport values.Beyond the Games, Gujarat — which hosted the National Games in 2022 — is pushing lesser-known disciplines like netball, lawn bowls, kabaddi, and yogasana into the spotlight. The bigger shift is strategic — Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar aim to become year round sports cities, with high performance labs, community spaces and university-linked infrastructure to ensure post Games utilisation.Ahmedabad also plans to discuss sustainability, diversity and inclusion during the Commonwealth heads of govt meeting (CHOGM) 2026 and 2028.Tejas Joshi, president of Credai Gujarat, said, “Hosting the CWG will be a game changer for Ahmedabad. The city’s infrastructure will see a drastic change with improved roads and connectivity. It will create demand for around 20,000 star-category hotel rooms and boost hotel and retail development. It will also eventually bring new migration to the city, resulting in increased housing demand.”Accommodation is expanding fast. “Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar offer 5,420 hotel rooms in the 3-5 star range, with 3,000 more planned, including 1,500 new 5-star rooms. Upgraded university hostels will house athletes during the Games and serve students later,” states the proposal.Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International (SVPI) airport, handling 13.4 million passengers annually, will add a new terminal by 2026 to double its capacity and introduce e-gates and kiosks.“World-class sports academies will be set up, encouraging a sports culture among city youths. After the Commonwealth Games, Ahmedabad aims to host the 2036 Olympics. The next decade will bring historic developments to the city,” said Joshi.Behind the scenes, athlete development is accelerating. Gujarat’s sports budget has grown from Rs 2.5 crore to Rs 521 crore over two decades, strengthening long-term athlete development pathways and strengthening academies. Part of the focus is also on scaling up talent hunts like Khel Mahakumbh, which saw engagement from 7 million participants, and schemes such as Shaktidoot to support athletes.Public participation will also be a defining layer. Programmes like Active Gujarat will convert riverfronts and parks into fitness zones. At the same time, Sabarmati Sundays — weekly openstreet events — will be expanded in the run-up to 2030. College students will join as youth ambassadors through the National Service Scheme (NSS) and the National Cadet Corps (NCC). By 2030, Gujarat plans to train 10,000 volunteers and create over 30,000 jobs linked to the Games.","Ahmedabad has been confirmed as the host city for the 2030 Commonwealth Games. The Games will be concentrated almost entirely within the Ahmedabad-Gandhinagar cluster.

SC to govt: Consider law to curb ridiculing of disabled,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-to-govt-consider-law-to-curb-ridiculing-of-disabled/articleshow/125626753.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Thursday suggested enacting a law on the line of the stringent SC and ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act to deter ridiculing of differently abled people, but the Union govt flagged the potential adverse impact of such legislation on creative artists depicting individuals with disability in movies and theatres.Hearing a petition by NGO Cure SMA Foundation that objected to five stand-up comedians ridiculing the exorbitant cost of treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and persons with disability in different shows, a bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi told solicitor general Tushar Mehta, “Why don’t you (Union govt) bring a stringent legislation like SC/ST Act? It criminalises ridiculing the depressed, deprived and discriminated class of citizens. A similar law to protect persons with disability could be considered for enactment.”Mehta, sharing the court’s concern, said he would discuss it with the authorities but flagged the point that such a legislation might create a problem for artists who play characters, for example dumb and blind, in movies, theatres and dramas. They may evoke humour but also seek to depict in a larger sense the difficulties they face in society, he said.Appearing for the NGO, senior advocate Aparajita Singh said the organisation arranges for treatment of SMA patients mainly through crowd funding, which was affected because of a stand-up comedian’s disparaging remarks on cost of treatment. She said that a decision to allow corporate entities to donate CSR funds for treatment of SMA patients would go a long way in mitigating their suffering.When the court said the govt should create a corpus for treatment of SMA patients, Mehta said the Centre already has a scheme through which treatments up to Rs 50 lakh are borne by the exchequer. However, in one case, which was before SC, the treatment cost Rs 16 crore, a huge sum which the govt felt could be utilised to treat many more patients. “There is a platform for corporate CSR donations,” he said.Whan Samay Raina’s counsel said the stand-up comedian, who was hauled up by the court for his disparaging remarks against SMA patients along with others of his tribe who had ridiculed disability, had contributed Rs 2.5 lakh to SMA, Singh said the NGO does not need his money. She said if he could atone for his mistake by hosting achievers with SMA, it would send a positive message in society and make the public aware of the degenerative disease.Singh gave the names of 11 outstanding achievers — IITians, computer professionals working with Google and Microsoft, acclaimed author, academicians, filmmaker, doctors and sportsman — who suffer from SMA, and suggested these persons are hosted on comedians’ digital shows to spread the message in society.The bench agreed and asked the comedians to host two shows every month featuring the achievers with SMA and disability and contribute the earnings towards treatment of differently abled and SMA patients. “We are putting a social burden on you instead of punishing you,” CJI Kant and Justice Bagchi said.",Supreme Court suggested enacting a law on the line of the stringent SC and ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.

NEW DELHI: The Central Industrial Security Force ( CISF ), which now fully secures the Parliament House complex (PHC), has okayed an extended four-year tenure for its personnel on Parliament security duty, which may be further stretched by a year. The move is aimed at striking the right balance between operational continuity, so as to enhance familiarity of personnel with members of Parliament, and the former’s optimum rotation for steady infusion of new blood.As per CISF’s general posting norms, its personnel are allowed a maximum three-year tenure in a given place of posting, though this may be extended. The revised posting policy specific to PHC security duties will ensure that a fixed proportion of the sanctioned strength is changed every year. The extended tenure will also strengthen familiarity of personnel with MPs and movement patterns within PHC, which is critical for ensuring accurate identification, secure access protocols and layered threat detection and response.The updated CISF guidelines specific to PHC security duties lay down tighter eligibility norms for gazetted officers and non-gazetted officers, with mandatory multi-stage screening. Personnel detailed for PHC duties must possess a clean service record, be in top shape-1 medical category, have no disciplinary or vigilance concerns and should have completed at least 2 specialised courses conducted by the NSG and Army.",The Central Industrial Security Force has okayed an extended four-year tenure for its personnel on Parliament security duty.

'Spur Of The Moment’: Former CJI Gavai Reacts To Shoe-Attack Attempt, Reveals Why He Took No Action

SC: Issue is social media content that goes viral before pull-down

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Thursday told the information and broadcasting ministry to prepare a draft mechanism for screening of user-generated content (UGC) prior to its uploading on social media, realising its vast potential to cause social upheaval before being taken down.A bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi said, “Right to freedom of speech is very important but a regulated right. It is not absolute as the First Amendment Rights in the US. Self-regulatory codes may not work in case of UGC. If anti-national content is uploaded on social media, by the time the govt notices it and orders its takedown, a day or two may pass, during which period it would go viral and cause damage to, or unrest in, society. ”The bench said, “We will not approve of a mechanism that will gag expression of views or freedom of speech. We are on a reasonable preventive mechanism, not to throttle but sieve content on social media prior to uploading. AI provides enormous potential to curate content. Some content may be academic yet... scurrilous. Today there is a statutory vacuum in this regard which needs to be filled.”Advocate Prashant Bhushan protested use of the word “anti-national” and said it is subjectively and selectively defined by authorities.The SC bench said, “Forget the definition of anti-national. If someone posts a video claiming parts of India with a neighbouring country, will it not be termed anti-national?”Bhushan differed. He asked, “If I question the accession of Sikkim to India, it is a mere viewpoint and cannot be termed anti-national.If I discuss China claiming parts of India’s territory, would it be anti-national?” Solicitor general Tushar Mehta protested loudly & said Bhushan should not instigate secession in a judicial proceeding related to curbing uploading of obscene, perverse & anti-national content on social media.CJI Kant said, “There was a case before us during Operation Sindoor. A person uploaded a video claiming he was with Pakistan and praised another country for helping Pakistan. When the matter came before the court, he simply said he had deleted the post within an hour of posting it. But in this age, the moment such content gets posted on social media, it immediately goes viral and there is no mechanism to prevent uploading of such content. ”“Right to free speech must be given the widest width. But in the case of content on social media, prosecution is a post-occurrence proceeding. There should be preventive mechanisms to stop spreading misinformation and damage to society,” the bench said.When two associations of broadcasters, OTTs and digital channels said they have self-regulatory codes and that there is no need for pre-censorship of content, the bench asked, “If the self-regulatory code is working, why is such content getting posted on social media?”“A portal under self-regulation cannot decide whether content is damaging to society, obscene or outrageous. We can’t also give that regulatory power to the govt, but to an autonomous body. Speaking against the govt is not anti-national activity. That is a precious democratic right. But the problem is with certain content on social media which goes viral prior to these being taken down,” the bench said.The court asked the I&B ministry to frame guidelines in four weeks and then publicise them to seek suggestions and objections from the public. The bench said the court would examine the issue after the govt prepares the draft mechanism, after considering the suggestions and objections of experts and public, to scrutinise social media content prior to their uploading.Attorney general R Venkaratamani and Mehta told the court that the ministry would carry out the exercise and take public opinion on it within four weeks. The bench said that the govt should take help of domain experts, jurists and media personnel in drafting the proposed mechanism.","The court asked the I&B ministry to frame guidelines in four weeks and then publicise them to seek suggestions and objections from public. ‘We will not approve of a mechanism that will gag expression of views or freedom of speech.

Deepfake Shock: Nirmala Sitharaman Reveals Fake Videos Of Herself Online, Warns Of AI’s Dark Side

Armour up with TOI to fight deepening threat of deepfakes





In a world where seeing is no longer believing, India is facing a new digital menace: AI-generated deepfakes.These hyper-realistic videos and audio clips don’t just distort reality. They manipulate public perception, spread misinformation and undermine trust in democracy itself.With 85.5 per cent of Indian households owning at least one smartphone, mobile phones have become India’s bank, classroom and television, making citizens more vulnerable to digital deception.During the 2024 elections, for instance, satirical deepfakes became a campaign tool of sorts. Apart from resurrecting dead leaders, it featured clips such as one that featured PM Narendra Modi dancing the garba with women and Kamal Nath dissing a popular welfare scheme.Though investigations and arrests followed, such videos blur the line between fact and fiction, risking the distortion of voter opinion and the integrity of the democratic process.Cybersecurity experts warn AI is also becoming a key tool in cybercrime: 80 per cent phishing campaigns in 2024 involved AI, with deepfakes exploited for scams.“When you can fake images, audio, and video, how do you know if a real video is real? Suddenly, everything is in question,” said Hany Farid, professor at the University of California, Berkeley, in a TOI interview last year about the worrying rise in AI misuse.The deepfake threat extends beyond politics. Recently, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman highlighted the misuse of AI to clone voices and produce fake videos impersonating her, warning of potential financial scams and the erosion of public trust. “I have seen several deepfake videos of myself being circulated online, manipulated to mislead citizens and distort facts,” Sitharaman said in Mumbai. “Criminals are using AI to mimic voices, clone identities, and create lifelike videos,” she added.Given that over 97% of India’s urban youth aged 15 to 29 owns a smartphone, the impact of such misinformation on a generation is worrying, say observers. “Deepfakes began in 2016. Back then, it was a joke. But the technology has only gotten better. Earlier, there were photoshopped face swaps. Now there are lipsync fakes,” said Prof. Farid, warning that the tech has become more refined, raising the risk of harassment of women through the use of non-consensual sexual imagery.In Nov 2023, actress Rashmika Mandanna became a victim of a viral deepfake video that superimposed her face on to compromising content, sparking widespread outrage. “The very term ‘deepfake’ comes from a Reddit user who in the early days of this technology used it to create porn,” said Farid, calling the new term ‘Generative AI’ clever “rebranding” by the male-dominated tech industry.As AI evolves, India must strengthen legal frameworks, enhance digital literacy, and bring together minds across sectors to ensure safety, say experts. “We need to label everything as real or not real,” said Farid, “We need real disclosures.” To combat the deepening threat of deep fakes, TOI has already started armouring up. Watch out for our ‘Don’t Get Scammed’ stories to stay informed and aware. After all, as Farid puts it, “if you don’t know what’s real, how will you know what’s false”?","AI-generated videos and audio clips don’t just distort reality.

SC orders nationwide audit of all private & deemed universities,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-orders-nationwide-audit-of-all-private-deemed-universities/articleshow/125624193.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court has ordered an unprecedented nationwide audit of all private and deemed universities, transforming a student grievance into a deep scrutiny of India’s sprawling higher education sector. In a sweeping directive, apex court has asked Centre, all states and UTs, and University Grants Commission (UGC) to submit personally sworn affidavits disclosing how these institutions were set up, who governs them, what regulatory approvals they hold, and whether they truly function on a notfor-profit basis.The move comes in response to a petition filed by a student of Amity University, Ayesha Jain, who alleged the institution harassed and barred her from attending classes after she legally changed her name. What began as a single case of administrative apathy has now turned into a judicial inquisition into the governance and financial practices of the entire private university ecosystem.Supreme Court’s focus is clear — expose the structural opacity and examine whether regulatory bodies like UGC have adequately performed their role. Past interventions show this isn’t unfamiliar terrain. In 2005, the court struck down Chhattisgarh Private Universities Act that had allowed over 100 shell institutions to operate without basic academic infrastructure.In 2009, a central review found 44 deemed universities unfit for their status due to poor academic and governance standards. In 2017, a Supreme Court verdict invalidated engineering degrees awarded via unapproved distance mode by deemed universities and barred them from conducting such courses without clear regulatory approval.This current review cuts deeper. It questions how private universities acquire land, appoint leadership, handle finances, and whether they have credible grievance redressal mechanisms. The demand for personal accountability — from chief secretaries to the UGC chairperson — signals judicial impatience with the status quo. A UGC official, on condition of anonymity, acknowledged: “There have been longstanding compliance gaps. This is a chance to restore public trust.” The official added that in the current case, the commission “in fact recommended the university to consider the name change request”.Private universities, many of which operate under different state and central laws, are rattled. “This is a sweeping brush,” said a vice chancellor of a reputed state private university. “We support transparency, but we also fear being tarred with the same brush as a few errant institutions.”Observers see timing in the court’s action. Higher Education Commission of India (HECI) Bill, intended to overhaul regulation and merge UGC, AICTE, and others under one roof, is expected in the upcoming Parliament session.“An issue concerning a private university legislated by state law is now expanded to rope in all private deemed universities governed by separate regulations under a central law. In a similar exercise, in 2017 in the case of Orissa Lift case, an issue concerning four deemed universities affected all in an irreversible manner. With HECI round the corner, it is hoped that the present issue finds a policy solution through HECI Bill,” said an academic policy expert.","Supreme Court has ordered an unprecedented nationwide audit of all private and deemed universities. The move comes in response to a petition filed by a student of Amity University, Ayesha Jain, who alleged the institution harassed and barred her from attending classes after she legally changed her name.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125624190,imgsize-986354,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

NEW DELHI: National Medical Commission (NMC) has turned down a proposal from Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Institute of Medical Excellence (SMVDIME), Katra, seeking to place 100% of its 50 MBBS seats under the All-India Quota (AIQ) through the Medical Counselling Committee (MCC).An NMC official said the commission did not approve the request as it would go against policy. Such decisions require broader consultation with states and stakeholders, and existing regulations cannot be amended for a single institution. Under current rules, 85% of MBBS seats are reserved for the state quota and 15% for the All-India Quota. ""This is not just about SMVDIME. Any change will have to be worked out with all states and stakeholders on board,"" the official said.The proposal may be placed before the board for further deliberation if needed, but the commission has declined it for now.The SMVDIME proposal comes at a time when the institution has found itself at the centre of controversy. Several Hindu organisations, including Sanatan Dharam Sabha and Vishwa Hindu Parishad, have protested over 43 out of the first batch of 50 MBBS students reportedly being from a particular community.The groups hold that since the institute is funded by devotees of Shri Mata Vaishno Devi, it should attract students from across the country rather than just one community or region.""As of now, 100% of candidates are from the state,"" an official confirmed, adding the college was seeking all-India quota allocation to widen the pool for intake of students.On Sept 8 last year, SMVDIME - located at the base camp of the Shri Mata Vaishno Devi shrine - was sanctioned 50 MBBS seats, paving the way for admissions to its first batch in the 2025-26 academic session.The institute began functioning in Nov last year from the administrative block of the Shri Mata Vaishno Devi University.","Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Institute of Medical Excellence sought to place 100% of its 50 MBBS seats under the All-India Quota (AIQ) National Medical Commission (NMC) has turned down the proposal.

Explained: Why Vikram-I Could Transform India’s Satellite Launch Market And Global Space Leadership

HYDERABAD/NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Thursday virtually inaugurated Hyderabad-based spacetech startup Skyroot Aerospace’s Infinity campus and unveiled India’s first commercial orbital rocket, Vikram-I, which will launch satellites into low Earth orbit (LEO).Emphasising that India is on track to emerge as a global leader in the satellite launch ecosystem, Modi said, “The private sector is making giant strides in India's space sector. Skyroot's Infinity campus is a reflection of new thinking, innovation and most importantly, youth power. Our youth's innovation, risk-taking ability and entrepreneurship are touching new heights.”Extending his best wishes to Skyroot CEO Pawan Kumar Chandana and company co-founder Naga Bharath Daka, the PM said the two entrepreneurs are an inspiration for young people. “Growth of the private space sector, spearheaded by companies like Skyroot, is also a testament to the govt's efforts to foster innovation and private enterprise in the space domain,” he said.The Infinity facility, spread over 2 lakh sq ft in Hyderabad, will have the capability to design, develop, integrate and test multiple launch vehicles, with a capacity to build one orbital rocket every month. It adds to Skyroot's 55,000-sq-ft integrated rocket design and development facility — Max-Q — near Hyderabad airport.Pointing out that though India’s space journey began with limited resources, its ambitions were never limited, Modi said: “India has proven that the height of dreams is determined not by resources but by resolve. Today, India possesses space sector capabilities that only a few countries in the world have.”He also praised Isro, saying it “has for decades given new wings to India’s space journey.” Modi also recalled the reforms undertaken in the space sector, with his govt opening up the sector to private innovation and preparing a new Space Policy.Modi highlighted that more than 300 space startups are today powering India’s space aspirations, with most of them starting out with small teams. “Gen-Z engineers, designers, coders and scientists are creating new technologies, whether in propulsion systems, composite materials, rocket stages or satellite platforms.”Space promoter and regulator IN-SPACe chairman Dr Pawan Goenka said that in just five years since the space sector was opened up, over 350 space startups have emerged. “The Infinity campus and Vikram-1 are testaments to what can be achieved when entrepreneurial ambition meets enabling policy. We are building more than rockets. We are building a competitive space economy,” he said.Skyroot co-founder Pawan Chandana said the company was ready to launch Vikram-1, fully designed and built in India, in the next two months. Pointing out that decisive space reforms had unlocked the skies for startups to fly, co-founder Naga Bharath Daka said Skyroot has already generated over 1,000 hi-tech jobs and will be investing around Rs 1,000 crore soon to become one of the few companies worldwide to achieve rapid and on-demand launch capabilities.Set up in 2018 by the two IIT alumni and former Isro scientists, Skyroot became the first Indian company to successfully build and launch a rocket into space with suborbital rocket Vikram-S.","PM Narendra Modi virtually inaugurated Hyderabad-based spacetech startup Skyroot Aerospace’s Infinity campus.

When Gujarat lifted its prohibition laws within GIFT City on New Year’s Eve 2023, it made national headlines. For a state where ‘dry’ has been a foundational principle since 1960, the move to create a watering hole where professionals could socialise — even if within the perimeters of India’s first international financial hub — felt audacious.Two years later, the glass remains half full, measured rather than overflowing. Official figures show 985 permanent employees with liquor access permits and 5,291 temporary ones for visitors. With 5,552 bulk litres of liquor sold to date — a modest but telling figure — Gujarat’s experiment with controlled conviviality proves that even in prohibition territory, business pragmatism can find a way.Inside GIFT City, every drink has a paper trail. Gujarat’s first taste of legal liquor operates within one of the most controlled ecosystems in the country: precise, trackable and fenced in by policy.Only those employed with registered firms in GIFT City can raise a glass — and only after securing a two-year access permit, renewable for Rs 1,000 annually. Visitors can join in, but only through one-day temporary permits issued by an authorised recommending officer.Each permit holder is allowed to host up to five guests at a time within licensed ‘wine and dine’ zones — sealed-off spaces inside hotels, clubs and restaurants operating under a designated foreign liquor licence.While there is no official limit on consumption volume, everything is billed and recorded.Even with a valid permit, the glass must stay within these designated zones. Every guest’s name is registered before service, every bill traceable, and yes, even Ahmedabad residents can be invited, provided the meeting is deemed business-related. The guardrails extend beyond the bar counter. Those who drink cannot drive; they must leave with a designated driver. In case of an inquiry, a wine-and-dine bill serves as proof of authorised consumption — every toast documented in detail within Gujarat’s carefully calibrated social experiment.GIFT City’s social scene operates within tight boundaries. Currently, two wine-and-dine facilities serve the zone, with more planned as new commercial towers and hotels open.Taral Shah, a developer working on projects in GIFT City, said: “GIFT City is India’s only operational International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) and smart city, and we have seen interest growing among foreign companies year by year. With liquor norms relaxed, companies from Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru are also setting up base in GIFT City. We expect more facilities as additional buildings become operational. We also hope that taxes will come down because wine-anddine facilities here primarily serve the salaried class. When the govt announced the relaxation two years ago, real estate enquiries in GIFT City saw a sudden jump of 25-30%.”The impact extends beyond realty metrics. An official at one of the licensed wine-and-dine facilities said the relaxation has transformed the sentiment within GIFT City: more employees now stay back in the evenings to catch up over drinks.“On weekdays, we see an average of about 15 people coming in to wine and dine. The number doubles to around 30 on weekends. The VAT is higher than other states, but we expect it to be rationalised soon and brought on a par with other states, which should further drive consumption,” the official said.The shift is reshaping the everyday rhythm at GIFT City as professionals embrace post-work socialisation. “The relaxation of liquor laws is a welcome move. The process of obtaining access is also convenient and easy. GIFT City is successfully creating a lifestyle and culture that matches international standards,” said Dhruv Singh (name changed), a professional working at GIFT City. Small changes signal larger shifts. Earlier, photography was banned at these facilities, but that restriction has been lifted — suggesting that GIFT City is easing into its new culture of controlled comfort.The demographics tell their own story: 15% of visitors at GIFT City’s wine-and-dine facilities are foreigners, while 85% are Indian, primarily employees and their occasional guests. The typical patron is between 26 and 45 years old. Beer dominates, with most patrons preferring to unwind over a pint or light drink after work. Spirits see lower uptake, likely due to both preferences and higher taxation.The licensed facilities operate from 11am and attract some daytime visitors, too, though crowds peak in the evenings. “We’re also seeing small groups using the space for formal and informal business discussions,” said a hotelier.Not every company, however, is ready to raise a toast just yet. Some firms deliberately avoid issuing permission letters for employees to access these facilities.“Our organisation has made a conscious decision to not issue letters to employees for drinking at the wine-and-dine facilities at GIFT City. Since alcohol prohibition continues beyond GIFT City limits, companies are worried about any incident that could tarnish their reputation,” explains Tanya Sharma (name changed), who works with an MNC at GIFT-IFSC.Industry leaders see broader potential. Narendra Somani, president of the Hotels and Restaurants’ Association (HRA), Gujarat, argues that two years of regulated liquor access at GIFT City shows how controlled liberalisation can help build a wineand-dine culture while also generating revenue for the state.“Govt should consider extending such relaxations in a regulated manner across Gujarat, especially with increasing foreign investments in Ahmedabad, a growing expat community, and Gujarat’s bids for the Commonwealth Games 2030 [which it won on Wednesday] and the 2036 Olympics. Gujarat’s hospitality sector loses social and corporate event business to other states. With thoughtful liberalisation, Gujarat’s tourism industry could take a significant leap forward,” Somani said.Sanjay Kaul, IAS, MD and group CEO, GIFT City, said: “The streamlining of prohibition norms specific to GIFT City has been widely welcomed by companies and professionals, who see it as a reflection of the city’s global readiness.”The numbers may appear modest, but they represent Gujarat’s incremental approach to social liberalisation within an economic enclave, carefully avoiding any challenge to the broader prohibition framework across the state.A senior official emphasises that the relaxation aligns with GIFT City’s ambition to position itself as a global financial hub.“Several companies in GIFT City had identified prohibition as a challenge in attracting young talent. Since the relaxation, we have growing traction from global firms and multinational corporations. Previously, semiconductor design companies favoured Bengaluru or Hyderabad. But now, with a semiconductor manufacturing cluster coming up in Gujarat, GIFT City has become a viable alternative,” a GIFT City official said.Recent developments support this claim. Sources confirmed that a European semiconductor design firm recently established an office in GIFT City. “Global corporations require wine-and-dine facilities not just for employees but also for hosting international clients. With world-class infrastructure, airport connectivity, and the recent easing of liquor norms, GIFT City now stands on a par with other global financial hubs,” the official added.GIFT City’s liquor model remains unique: a closed-loop ecosystem where access, sale, and consumption are all verified and logged — an administrative “wet bubble” in an otherwise dry state.As GIFT City expands with new corporate tenants and residential projects, the central question persists: will Gujarat replicate this model elsewhere, or will it remain a singular concession at India’s global financial hub?For now, Gujarat’s controlled experiment continues — each glass raised within GIFT City represents not just a drink, but a data point in one of India’s most closely-watched policy experiments.","Gujarat lifted its prohibition laws within GIFT City on New Year’s Eve 2023.

NEW DELHI: To make civil services future ready and to achieve the goal of a developed India, the principal secretary to PM, P K Mishra , Thursday suggested three guiding principles — “reorienting the purpose of civil services to developmental state, re-imagining selection to identify deeply capable individuals and building a lifelong learning state”.Addressing the centenary conference of Union Public Service Commission (UPSC), the country’s top bureaucrat also spoke about a shift from process compliance to outcome delivery; from incremental improvement to accelerated transformation; from siloed govt departments to interoperable digital infrastructure; and from a state that delivers to citizens to a state that partners with citizens.In a statement, the PMO said Mishra underlined how emergence of technology, urbanisation, climate challenges and frequent disasters have reshaped the responsibilities of civil servants, and today’s governance demands collaboration more than hierarchy.Highlighting the world is becoming more interconnected and volatile, with strategic competition spanning technology, supply chains, data, cybersecurity, AI, space and critical minerals, he said civil servants are managers of uncertainty, interpreters of complexity and guardians of India’s strategic interests, and their readiness must begin with how they are selected.","Principal secretary to PM, P K Mishra, suggests three guiding principles.

Superbugs now resistant to key everyday antibiotics: ICMR,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/superbugs-now-resistant-to-key-everyday-antibiotics-icmr/articleshow/125626275.cms,"NEW DELHI: Some of the most common infections - urinary tract, pneumonia, sepsis and diarrhoeal illnesses - are becoming increasingly harder to treat in India as widely used antibiotics continue to fail at alarming rates.ICMR's annual report 2024 'Antimicrobial Resistance Research & Surveillance Network (AMRSN)', showed that routine drugs like fluoroquinolones, third-generation cephalosporins, carbapenems and piperacillin-tazobactam are rapidly losing effectiveness against bacteria most frequently seen in hospitals.Based on nearly one lakh lab-confirmed infection samples from leading hospitals, the report showed drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria continue to dominate. E coli, the most common cause of UTIs and abdominal and bloodstream infections, showed declining susceptibility to strong antibiotics. Klebsiella pneumoniae, a major cause of pneumonia and sepsis, is resistant to piperacillin-tazobactam in nearly three-fourths of the cases and to carbapenems in most samples, limiting treatment options.In ICUs, the situation is even more alarming. Acinetobacter baumannii shows 91% resistance to meropenem, forcing doctors to use more toxic or complicated drug combinations.Pseudomonas aeruginosa continues to show rising resistance. Overall, 72% of bloodstream infections were caused by drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, while ventilator-associated pneumonia was driven largely by acinetobacter, klebsiella and pseudomonas - organisms against which many commonly prescribed high-end antibiotics are ineffective.Though some isolated improvements were seen - including better sensitivity of E coli to amikacin and select cephalosporins - the broader resistance landscape continues to worsen. Diarrhoeal pathogens showed high resistance to fluoroquinolones and cephalosporins, and more than 95% of salmonella yyphi samples were resistant to fluoroquinolones. Among fungi, candida auris showed resistance in nearly 10% of isolates, while one-third of aspergillus samples were resistant to amphotericin B.ICMR said the data reflects hospital infections, not community patterns. But experts warn the message is unmistakable: India's most widely used antibiotics are losing power, and critically ill patients are already facing the consequences. Without aggressive stewardship and rational prescribing, they caution, even common infections may soon become untreatable.Dr Rommel Tickoo, director, internal medicine, Max Hospital, Saket, said the findings mark a dangerous shift. ""Strong antibiotics are failing against infections once treated easily. This signals an urgent public-health challenge that demands tighter control on antibiotic use and stronger infection-prevention measures.""Data shows how quickly options are shrinking. ""Everyday bacteria are resisting medicines we once relied on. In ICUs, choices are narrowing even further. Rational antibiotic use is no longer optional - it's essential to preserve what still works,"" Dr Rakesh Gupta, senior consultant, internal medicine, Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals, said.","Routine drugs like fluoroquinolones, third-generation cephalosporins, carbapenems and piperacillin-tazobactam are rapidly losing effectiveness against bacteria most frequently seen in hospitals.

PM Modi Announces Major Move Allowing Private Players Into Nuclear Sector To Spur Advanced Reactors

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi said on Thursday that his govt is moving towards opening up the nuclear sector in the country for private sector investments on the lines of the space sector.“The scope of reforms is continuously expanding. Just as space innovation was opened to the private sector, India is now moving towards opening the nuclear sector as well,” Modi said while inaugurating Skyroot’s Infinity Campus in Hyderabad via video conferencing. “A strong role for the private sector is being laid in this field, which will create opportunities in small modular reactors, advanced reactors and nuclear innovation. This reform will give new strength to India’s energy security and technological leadership,” he said.The PM’s remarks came ahead of Parliament’s winter session in which a key nuclear energy bill proposing to open up the civil nuclear sector to private players is listed. The Atomic Energy Bill, 2025, is listed in the Lok Sabha bulletin for the session, which will start from Dec 1. Amendments to another key nuclear law, Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act (CLNDA), 2010, are also on the cards.These amendments, if successfully passed, will usher in big reforms in the nuclear sector at a time when India has set a target of generating at least 100 GW nuclear energy by 2047.At present, the Atomic Energy Act prohibits the participation of the private sector or even state govts. Under this law, the power to operate nuclear power plants is vested in the central govt and companies or corporations established by it. Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL), a PSU under the Department of Atomic Energy, is the only entity operating nuclear power plants, and currently operates all 24 commercial nuclear reactors in the country.Modi also said the future will depend greatly on the research being carried out today, and underscored that the govt is focused on providing maximum opportunities for youth in research. He underlined that the Rs 1 lakh crore Research, Development, and Innovation Fund will provide significant support to the youth. Modi said more than 10,000 Atal Tinkering Labs have already been set up to instil a spirit of research and innovation among students, and added that work is under way to establish 50,000 new labs in the coming days, he said.","PM Narendra Modi said on Thursday that his govt is moving towards opening up the nuclear sector in the country for private sector investments on the lines of the space sector. “A strong role for the private sector is being laid in this field, which will create opportunities in small modular reactors, advanced reactors and nuclear innovation,"" he said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125623836,imgsize-906329,width-400,resizemode-4/photo-credit-pti.jpg"

According to a police statement, the searches were carried out “in the backdrop of the recent surge in terrorist activities and to curb the tendency of radicalisation among youth”.While raiding several locations in south Kashmir’s Pulwama district, the search teams inspected multiple premises associated with JeI-linked suspects, police stated, while adding that “no incriminating material was seized from any of the locations”. “These searches are part of J&K police’s continuous efforts to dismantle radical networks, prevent anti-national activities, and strengthen peace and stability in the district,” the police statement said.Kulgam district, also in south Kashmir, saw “meticulously coordinated searches at multiple locations” that yielded “a significant quantity of electronic gadgets, literature and documents suspected to have relevance to ongoing investigations,” police stated.“All recovered materials have been seized on the spot and taken into custody for detailed scrutiny,” the statement added.In central Kashmir’s Budgam district, several residences and institutes allegedly linked to JeI were raided “based on credible intelligence that some JeI members are engaged in anti-national activities”, the police statement said.Raids were also carried out in Anantnag and Shopian districts, police said.In north Kashmir’s Handwara area, search parties raided Jamia Islamia Institute at Waripora, acting on “information regarding suspected unlawful activities and possible links with JeI”, police said. “Electronic devices recovered during the operation have been seized and are being thoroughly examined to ascertain their usage and to verify any suspected affiliations,” the statement said.",J&K Police conducted a series of raids across Kashmir Valley at multiple locations allegedly linked to Jamaat-e-Islami.

Highway builders to get negative marks for substandard work in rating,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/highway-builders-to-get-negative-marks-for-substandard-work-in-rating/articleshow/125620786.cms,"Representative image (AI)

NEW DELHI: Highway contractors and concessionaires not meeting project quality standards will get up to 30 negative marks — a penalty that will lower their ratings and make it more difficult for them to secure new contracts in the future. Conversely, contractors who complete projects on time and maintain high quality will receive 30 and 40 marks, respectively.Under the framework for ‘Contractor/Concessionaire Rating System for NH Projects”, unveiled by the road transport ministry on Thursday, the maximum score will be 100 and the rating exercise will be held annually. Highway builders will be rated on seven parameters — timely completion, quality, maintenance, safety, disputes, subcontracting, overall performance and user rating, and negative marks for poor quality.This rating system is being introduced amid rising complaints about substandard construction, poor quality and inadequate maintenance of highway stretches. These issues have been flagged by PM Narendra Modi during highway sector review meetings and also by parliamentary panels. Highway minister Nitin Gadkari has repeatedly sought action against contractors for poor-quality work.According to the framework, failures, major defects, or stretches getting damaged before completion or during the defect-liability period will attract up to five negative points, while failures or defects in retaining (RE) walls will draw up to 10 negative points.Contractors will also be penalised for failing to deploy qualified professionals. Recent incidents such as damage on the Delhi–Mumbai Expressway and the collapse of an RE wall on NH-66 in Kerala have been glaring examples of poor-quality construction.Officials said the rating system assigns 70 marks for timely completion and quality, aiming to clearly identify high-performing contractors. “While poor performers will face penalties, good performers will be rewarded,” an official said. The rating will primarily be done during the construction period to ensure objective assessment and identification of performers and non-performers.All national highway projects completed or provisionally completed in the last three years will be eligible for ratings. Projects that have been underway for at least 180 days since the last appointed date will also be rated.Contracts will be grouped into three categories: Rs 100 crore–300 crore; Rs 300 crore–1,000 crore; and above Rs 1,000 crore.",Road transport ministry unveils framework for ‘Contractor/Concessionaire Rating System for NH Projects’ Maximum score will be 100 and the rating exercise will be held annually.

Guests said the 24-year-old bride, who lost her father during the Covid pandemic, and her family had arranged the money neatly on a ceremonial plate during the tilak ceremony.But the groom bowed before it and returned it, saying, ""I have no right to take this. This is the bride's father's hard-earned money. I cannot accept it."" His quiet act of resistance against the age-old practice initially left the gathering stunned before it drew resounding appreciation.The groom's parents supported his decision, while the bride's family expressed deep gratitude. The wedding proceeded with renewed warmth as rituals, including the ‘jaimala' and ‘kanyadaan', were performed. The bride later left for her new home with smiles and dignity, as villagers praised the groom's stand as a strong message against dowry and a step toward equality in marriage.Locals said Awadhesh Rana's public return of the money, with folded hands, has become the talk of the district -- a symbolic rebuke to dowry seekers.

(With agency inputs)

NEW DELHI: Former IPS officer Kiran Bedi has once again raised alarm over Delhi’s deteriorating air quality, sharing multiple posts on X (formerly Twitter) highlighting the city’s hazardous pollution levels.In her latest update, she revealed that the Delhi Air Quality Index (AQI) currently stands at 458, classifying the air as hazardous. The main pollutants recorded were PM10: 339.92, PM2.5: 378.56, NO2: 97.67, SO2: 22.23, O3: 9.95, and CO: 120.53.Bedi also reposted a cartoon from Down To Earth magazine, showing two patients in a hospital—one wearing an oxygen mask with AQI 700, the other injured after demanding clean air—underscoring the human impact of worsening pollution.She further described in a post on November 27 the conditions in her own area, Indirapuram, where the AQI has reached 587, explaining that she has kept her child home from school despite teachers’ requests and has written to the principal to protect her family.In previous posts, dated November 25, Bedi detailed how Delhi’s pollution has severely affected her health, causing sneezing, chest congestion, and restricted mobility, while preventing her from enjoying outdoor activities like walks in Lodhi Garden or Nehru Park.""It’s Agonising. And depressing. Sir please intervene proactively. I live in Indirapuram, and the AQI is 587 right now. I have not sent my child to school inspite of teachers messages. I have written a firm mail to the principal. Whatever is in my area of control I will do that.""Asked about her social media post seeking the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) intervention to address Delhi’s air pollution crisis, former Puducherry Lt Governor and ex-IPS officer Kiran Bedi says,"" I have requested the honourable Prime Minister’s leadership because, at present, a retired civil servant is heading the commission and supervising the matter. Committees and groups have been formed, but the strong political weight that is needed at this moment is missing. This is essentially a coordination issue involving multiple states - Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, and Punjab. Since it is an inter-state matter, it cannot be left solely to a retired civil servant. Whether it is construction, sanitation, or developmental regulations, enforcement requires powerful, coordinated, and effective leadership.""She adds,""This situation is similar to Covid. I personally witnessed how the Prime Minister guided, inspired, and united the country during that crisis. When coordination is required across states and regions, especially with existing political challenges, no one is better at it than him. If the Prime Minister does not wish to intervene directly, the commission can at least be placed under a Group of Ministers, because this issue concerns multiple states and impacts public health. Air pollution may appear to subside but keeps returning, and it is harming every Delhi resident, from children to the elderly. That is why strong leadership from the PMO is essential.”","The Delhi Air Quality Index (AQI) currently stands at 458, classifying the air as hazardous.

Andhra Braces for Cyclone Montha Landfall; IMD Warns of Heavy Rain, Strong Winds

CHENNAI: The city braces for the much-delayed heavy rainfall as Cyclone Ditwah, which formed over the Bay on Thursday, may move towards the north Tamil Nadu coast in two days. India Meteorological Department has upgraded alerts from orange to red (extremely heavy rain of more than 20cm in 24 hours) for delta and a few north coastal districts on Nov 28 and 29.The city and neighbouring districts remain under an orange alert for heavy to very heavy rainfall (12cm to 20cm in 24 hours) on Nov 29 and 30. As of Thursday evening, the powerful cyclonic storm, which rapidly intensified from a depression in less than 24 hours, lay 670km south-southeast of Chennai, triggering torrential rainfall over Sri Lanka.B Amudha, deputy director general (additional charge), regional meteorological centre, IMD, said the storm is likely to bring heavy rainfall and a gradual increase in wind speeds. “Wind speeds may be 60-80kmph gusting to 90kmph in areas along the storm’s path. For the next two days, strong surface winds of 4050kmph may prevail over coastal Tamil Nadu, Puducherry and Karaikal,” she said.On Thursday morning, the storm moved at around 15kmph before slowing down. Earlier, the system intensified into a depression and then into a deep depression overnight. On Friday, the city and suburbs may receive one or two spells of light to moderate rainfall with thunderstorms and lightning.Partly cloudy skies may keep the maximum temperature around 30°C and the minimum at about 25°C.Heavy rainfall activity may first pick up across delta districts before spreading to north Tamil Nadu on Nov 29 and 30. Chengalpet is among the six districts under a red alert on Nov 29 with heavy to very heavy rain, and extremely heavy rain at one or two places likely. On Nov 30, Chennai, Chengalpet, Kancheepuram, Tiruvallur and Ranipet may receive heavy to very heavy rainfall at a few places.While IMD is yet to confirm the landfall location as of Thursday evening, weather blogger Pradeep John said the storm may bypass the Chennai coast, following a track similar to Cyclone Ogni in Oct 2006. “This track is bound to give very heavy rains. Cyclone Ogni did,” he posted.Meanwhile, Cyclone Senyar weakened over the Strait of Malacca after causing flash floods and landslides in North Sumatra, Indonesia.","Cyclone Ditwah, which formed over the Bay on Thursday, may move towards the north Tamil Nadu coast in two days.

Delhi Air Pollution Protest At India Gate Turns Violent Amid ‘Madvi Hidma Amar Rahe’ Slogans

NEW DELHI: A day after Graded Response Action Plan's (GRAP-III again till it turns severe ) stage-III restrictions were lifted, the city's air quality slipped into the higher end of the very poor category. The air quality index (AQI) stood at 377 on Thursday against 327 a day earlier. However, Commission for Air Quality Management said the restrictions under GRAP-III again till it turns severe stage-III would be re-invoked only if AQI surpassed 400.Central Pollution Control Board's data shows that AQI had seen a sharp rise since Thursday morning after winds failed to pick up. AQI was 351 at 8am and rose to 381 at 7pm. The air quality is forecast to remain very poor over the next few days. ""Winds remained mostly calm and briefly rose to four-five km, leading to the accumulation of pollutants,"" said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president at Skymet Meteorology.The GRAP-III again till it turns severe stage-III came into force on Nov 11 after AQI entered the severe category. Though Delhi's AQI remained in very poor consistently from Nov 14, stage-III was revoked on Wednesday after a marginal improvement in the air quality.The stage-III restrictions include a ban on construction and demolition activity, restriction on plying of BS-III petrol and BS-IV diesel vehicles, 50% work from home for govt and private offices, and hybrid mode for classes.Sunil Dahiya, founder and lead analyst at think tank EnviroCatalyst, said, ""GRAP-III again till it turns severe , though inadequate in its existing stage, is still the only mechanism to reduce emissions at source, and its invocation or lifting has to be based on forecasts and not just on instantaneous readings without full consideration of meteorology and emissions. A more comprehensive approach to emission reduction with a modified GRAP-III again till it turns severe and a long-term systematic plan is needed. "" If the meteorology doesn't improve and GRAP-III again till it turns severe curbs are lifted, the air quality will deteriorate again, which seems to be happening now, he pointed out.Meanwhile, Delhi govt has initiated the installation of six more continuous ambient air quality monitoring stations, which will become operational by Jan 15, said environment minister Manjinder Singh Sirsa. The stations are being set up at Jawaharlal Nehru University, Indira Gandhi National Open University, the ISRO earth station near Malcha Mahal, Delhi Cantonment, Commonwealth Sports Complex and Netaji Subhash University of Technology (west campus), covering key institutional and residential zones across south, central and southwest Delhi.Sirsa said the new stations would significantly enhance govt's ability to track pollution sources and trends in real-time, and respond with targeted measures.Delhi's minimum temperature was 8.3 degrees Celsius, two notches below normal, on Thursday. The maximum temperature stood at 25.7 degrees Celsius.",The air quality index (AQI) stood at 377 on Thursday against 327 a day earlier.

MUMBAI: The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has issued stop-work notices to 53 construction sites for contributing to air pollution, as the city struggles with deteriorating Air Quality Index (AQI) levels.On Thursday, the civic body also directed that all air pollution guidelines must be strictly followed, including the installation of sensors to monitor AQI, which should remain operational at all times.Ashwini Joshi, Additional Municipal Commissioner (City), warned that strict action would be taken if any AQI sensors were found non-operational.Earlier in the day, the Bombay High Court said the authorities cannot blame ash clouds from the volcanic eruption in Ethiopia for the air pollution in India's financial capital, as the AQI has been poor for a long time.A bench of Chief Justice Shree Chandrashekhar and Justice Gautam Ankhad was urged to take up the hearing of a bunch of pleas from 2023 on the issue of air pollution in the city.Senior counsels Darius Khambata and Janak Dwarkadas, appearing for the petitioners, said the AQI in the city has been consistently poor and above 300 this month.Additional government pleader Jyoti Chavan said air pollution has worsened due to the volcanic eruption in Ethiopia two days ago.The court, however, did not entertain the argument.""Even before this eruption, if one stepped out, visibility was poor beyond 500 metres,"" the court said.Referring to the situation in Delhi, which is witnessing alarming levels of AQI, the HC asked what effective measures can be taken to address the issue.""We are all seeing what is happening in Delhi. What is the effect of that?"" the bench questioned, posting the matter for hearing on Friday.Hayli Gubbi, a shield volcano in Ethiopia’s Afar region, erupted on Sunday, sending a massive ash plume soaring up to 14 km into the sky.The ash cloud spread eastward, reaching across the Red Sea and affecting regions as far as the Arabian Peninsula and the Indian subcontinent.In response, Shiv Sena MP Milind Deora wrote to BMC Commissioner Bhushan Gagrani, urging immediate and extraordinary measures, including a temporary halt to all digging and construction activities until air quality improves.""Mumbai's air pollution crisis is no longer a seasonal issue --- it is a public health emergency. India needs a nationwide war and a national consensus against air pollution,"" Deora said.Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Aaditya Thackeray said even as Mumbai's AQI worsens every day, and the city competes with Delhi on this score, the governments from top to bottom, currently controlled by the BJP and its allies, conveniently ignore people's plight.""In Mumbai, builders and contractors are a priority for the BJP government, while apart from the construction and demolition works, tree felling in the name of development is the new mantra of the BJP,"" he alleged.On its part, the civic body pointed out that various steps are being undertaken to address air pollution, including forcing bakeries and crematoriums to use cleaner fuels, introducing electric buses, managing construction debris scientifically, and using machines to sprinkle water on roads to control dust.In October last year, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) issued 28 guidelines to curb construction-related dust pollution. The measures include installing metal fencing and green cloth coverings around sites, water sprinkling, proper storage and transport of debris, installing air quality monitoring devices, and setting up smoke absorption systems, among others.To ensure compliance, the civic body has formed flying squads. As of November 26, the BMC has issued 53 stop-work notices to construction sites contributing to air pollution, including 17 in Siddharth Nagar (G-South ward), five in Mazgaon (E ward), and 31 in Malad West (P-North ward).Additional Municipal Commissioner Ashwini Joshi also reviewed the operational status of sensor-based AQI monitoring systems at construction sites on Thursday. A total of 662 systems have been installed across Mumbai, with 251 more under installation. Of these, 400 systems are integrated with a unified data dashboard, while 117 were found inactive.Joshi warned that stringent action will be taken against responsible parties through the 95 ward-level flying squads if any AQI monitoring system is found non-functional.Bakeries have also been identified as a contributing factor to air pollution. Out of 593 bakeries in Mumbai, 209 already operate using clean fuel.The civic body said that due to its efforts, an additional 57 bakeries have transitioned to clean fuel, 75 have initiated this transition within the last six months, and 88 have applied to obtain piped natural gas from Mahanagar Gas.",BMC has issued stop-work notices to 53 construction sites for contributing to air pollution.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai on AI layoffs









Google recently launched its most-advanced AI model — Gemini 3.0. Announcing the launch of Gemini 3.0, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said that it is ‘the best model in the world for multimodal understanding’. Now weeks after the intense work on Gemini 3.0, Google CEO Sundar Pichai has acknowledged that his engineers are overdue for a break. As reported by Business Insider, speaking on the Google AI” Release Notes podcast, Pichai said “I think some folks need some sleep,” adding that hopefully he and his teams “get a bit of rest” now that the milestone launch is behind them.The comment made by Pichai comes as Google is moving towards a $4 trillion market cap as the stock price of the company has surged by nearly 70% this year, including a 12% jump following Gemini 3’s debut on November 18. The Gemini 3.0 model has been widely praised for its reasoning, speed and multimodal capabilities. Recently, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff also described the Gemini 3.0 model as an ‘insane’ leap forward. He also added that after using Gemini 3.0 for two hours he will not go back to ChatGPT.After the successful roll out of Gemini 3.0, Google has managed to reclaim its frontrunner position in the AI race. Pichai noted that years of hard work of the company is the sole reason behind this success.“In 2016, I wanted the whole company to be AI-first,” he said, pointing to milestones such as the creation of Google Brain in 2012, the acquisition of DeepMind in 2014, AlphaGo’s victory in Go, and the unveiling of Google’s own tensor processing units (TPUs), which were used to train Gemini.Pichai further talked about the Google’s strategy. Pichai explained that Google always worked towards a “full-stack” approach to innovation, improving everything from infrastructure to model training and test-time compute. He admitted that when generative AI first gained traction, Google was short on capacity and had to invest heavily to scale. “If you were on the outside, it would look like we were quiet, or we were behind, but we were putting all the building blocks in place, and then executing on top of it,” he said.Recently, Google CEO Sundar Pichai talked about AI layoffs. In a recent expansive interview with BBC, Sundar Pichai pushed back against concerns that AI could eventually lead to mass job cuts. Pichai said that the tech will eliminate some jobs but also “evolve and transition” others -- ramifications that mean ""people will need to adapt.""Pichai further added that AI may be gunning for his job, but he doesn’t seem too worried about it. AI is advancing so swiftly, he said, that over the next 12 months the tech will be able to perform “complex” tasks and act as an agent on a users' behalf. ""That’s where it gets really interesting,"" he said.",Google recently launched its most-advanced AI model — Gemini 3.0.

Software developers have reported that the new model performed well on tasks such as automating website and product design and writing code, which is a lucrative revenue stream for OpenAI and its competitors, such as Anthropic.Concerns about OpenAI's slowing growth arose late this summer. During a recent quarterly earnings call with investors, the company’s CFO, Sarah Friar, confirmed that user engagement with the popular AI chatbot ChatGPT had cooled, despite the company's otherwise positive financial results.According to a report by The Information (as seen by The Economic Times), Sam Altman's memo noted that competitors such as Google and Anthropic are narrowing the gap in the AI raceAnthropic’s Claude model generates computer code for various tasks using conversational prompts.Meanwhile, Google has been integrating its Gemini AI chatbot into its search app, productivity tools and other services. However, recently, Claude gained a new challenger from OpenAI with the introduction of Codex.Google also holds an economic advantage. OpenAI’s growth has been rapid and the company now carries a valuation of around $500 billion as a for-profit entity. It is expected to bring in about $13 billion in revenue, but is estimated to burn roughly $100 billion in its push toward superintelligence.With a market value of about $3.5 trillion, Google reported free cash flow of over $70 billion in the past four quarters. A significant portion of this comes from providing cloud services to OpenAI, Anthropic and other competitors.Sam Altman also encouraged OpenAI employees to stay confident and focus on the company's larger goals.Altman wrote in the internal memo.Altman added.Recently, OpenAI partnered with Apple's biggest suuplier Foxconn to design and build AI data-centre components in the US. Under this partnership, OpenAI will help develop future server systems and may purchase Foxconn-produced hardware in the coming days. Altman noted that this collaboration can strengthen American manufacturing infrastructure.Commenting on the partnership, Altman said:Foxconn will join OpenAI’s supply chain to manufacture AI-related hardware in a more American way. The company, known for iPhone assembly, also manufactures AI servers and supplies components to Nvidia.Commenting on the partnership, Foxconn chairman Young Liu said that the companyIn September, Oracle also inked a $300 billion deal with ChatGPT maker OpenAI. Since then, the company has shed more than $300 billion in market value, and Wall Street is starting to wonder if a partnership between the companies will bring returns or pose risks for Oracle.","OpenAI CEO Sam Altman acknowledges Google's AI advancements, noting potential temporary economic challenges but expressing confidence in OpenAI's rapid progress. Despite concerns about slowing ChatGPT engagement, Altman remains optimistic about the company's long-term vision for superintelligence.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125488762,imgsize-33282,width-400,resizemode-4/125488762.jpg"

Benchmark indices advanced for the third straight week, with the Nifty hitting a new all-time high of 26,310 during Thursday’s session. The rally was fueled by positive global cues and rising expectations of a U.S. Federal Reserve rate cut in December. Market sentiment further improved as crude oil prices eased on renewed optimism about a potential Ukraine–Russia peace agreement. Additionally, a lower India CPI inflation print boosted hopes of an RBI rate cut in the upcoming monetary policy review.A key point to note is that the index showed a much faster recovery this week, erasing the entire three-day decline in just one session and reinforcing the bullish momentum. Strong buying interest in heavyweight large-cap stocks fueled a sharp rebound, with market leadership clearly shifting toward major heavyweights.Going ahead we expect the index to maintain overall positive bias and gradually head towards 26,500 and then towards 26,800 levels in the coming weeks being the measuring implication of the recent range breakout (26,100-25,400). The two-month uptrend has remained well within a rising channel, indicating sustained demand even at higher levels and reinforcing the positive bias for the index.The channel’s upper band also aligns near the 26,800 marks.Short-term support is positioned in the 25,800–25,700 zone, which aligns with the confluence of the 20- and 50-day EMAs, the lower band of the two-month rising channel, and the recent two-week lows. This makes it an important level to monitor from a short-term perspective, sustaining above the same will keep the bias positive.While the Nifty and Nifty Midcap indices have already touched new all-time highs, the Small Cap index remains about 9% below its peak. We expect a gradual catch-up in the small-cap segment in the coming weeks, supported by emerging buying interest near the 52-week EMA in the Nifty small cap index.Key Monitorables for the short term:Bank Nifty extended its rally for the fourth week in a row as it rallied to a fresh all time high of 59866 levels in Thursday session.The index rebounded in Wednesday session from the upper band of the recent range breakout area and closed firmly above the 59,500 levels. The entire up move of the last 2 months is well channelled signaling sustained demand at elevated levels.We expect the index to retain its positive momentum and move towards the 60,400 level in the coming sessions, based on the measuring implication of the recent range breakout. A move above that will open further upside towards 61,000 levels in the coming weeks Meanwhile, the 58,500 is likely to act as a crucial support area, with the previous resistance now expected to serve as support.The daily 14 periods RSI has generated a bullish crossover above its nine periods average thus validating positive bias.The stock is witnessing buying demand after a base at the 100 days EMA and the 61.8% retracement of the previous up move (1022-1223) signaling strength.We expect the stock to move higher and head towards 1240 levels in the coming month being the 123.6% external retracement of the previous decline (1223-1104).The daily 14 periods RSI has generated a buy signal moving above its nine periods average thus validates positive bias in the stock.The stock is rebounding from the support area of 480-470 being the confluence of the previous major lows and the trendline support joining the lows of October 2024 and February 2025,We expect the stock to resume up move and head towards 535 levels in the coming month being the 80% retracement of the recent breather (557-474)The daily stochastic has rebounded from the oversold territory and has generated a buy signal thus supporting the positive bias in the stock.","According to Bajaj Broking Research, the top stock picks for November 28, 2025 are JSW Steel, and JSW Energy.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Stock market today: Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , the Indian equity benchmark indices, opened flat in trade on Friday. While Nifty50 was above 26,200, BSE Sensex was near 85,750. At 9:27 AM, Nifty50 was trading at 26,219.45, up 4 points or 0.015%. BSE Sensex was at 85,750.14, up 30 points or 0.035%.Technical analysts indicate 26,300 as crucial resistance and breakout point. A definitive close above this threshold could potentially lead to new peaks in the 26,350–26,450 range.Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited says, “The important takeaway from the new records set by Nifty and Sensex yesterday is that these are new records driven by a narrow rally in a limited number of performing largecaps. Despite the market at new highs, majority of retail investors, particularly the newbies who rushed into the market after the Covid crash in March 2020, are holding portfolios which show losses. This paradox is due to the retail investors’ obsession with smallcaps and their belief that smallcaps will outperform irrespective of their valuation. If retail investors have to participate in the rally expected in 2026, to be driven primarily by higher earnings growth, they will have to invest in largecaps and quality midcaps with growth potential.“Even though Sensex and Nifty touched new highs yesterday, the Nifty Smallcap Index is around 9 % below its peak. This huge underperformance is primarily due to the poor earnings growth and high valuations of this segment. Smallcaps, in general, are likely to continue underperforming, in the short- to medium-term.”Brent crude remained steady on Friday whilst market participants observed Russia-Ukraine peace talks developments and anticipated Sunday's OPEC+ meeting results regarding future supply adjustments that have been affecting market conditions.Foreign portfolio investors sold shares worth Rs 1,255 crore net on Wednesday.

A lot is being talked about keeping agriculture, dairy, and poultry out of free-trade agreements. Will the interests of small farmers be compromised?

Are talks on for certain agreements?

Has the BJP’s 2017 promise of doubling farmers’ income by 2022 been achieved, when farmers argue it still hasn’t materialised by late 2025?

When two morchas were active in Punjab over

minimum support price

(MSP)

demand, the ministerial discussions were abruptly broken off. Are there any chances of reviving talks?

Punjab has achieved significant progress in curbing stubble burning, while cases have risen in Madhya Pradesh, which you represent. What explains this contrast?

Punjab farmers have long been demanding financial assistance for

crop residue management

. Is there any possibility of such support?

on Thursday visited the village to meet farmers and hailed their efforts in managing crop residue. Chouhan, in a conversation with, shared his views on free-trade agreements, farm ’ income, stalled MSP talks, and the rising challenge of stubble burning and how he is looking to the Punjab model to curb farm fires.The central govt is serious about safeguarding the interests of the agriculture and dairy sectors. Even if trade agreements are signed with other countries, officials involved in the negotiations will prioritise farmers’ interests. Since agriculture plays a crucial role in India’s economy, protecting this sector remains high on Indian govt’s agenda.The govt holds discussions with several countries and blocs on various issues, but it would not be appropriate to comment on them at this stage.While many farmers have seen their incomes rise even threefold, the average farmer’s income has doubled over these years. Natural calamities in certain regions can temporarily affect earnings, but overall, farmers are now earning twice as much as they did before 2017.Some rounds of talks took place in Chandigarh, however, these were suspended after farmers put forth certain conditions, including non-involvement of state govt representatives in such talks.Such conditions should not be laid, and there should be no room for trust deficit. We are ready for talks anytime, without any preconditions.Madhya Pradesh was earlier more focused on soybean and other crops. It has shifted to large-scale paddy cultivation over past 4–5 years, which has led to a rise in stubble burning after the harvest. We are working on this and trying to replicate the Punjab model to contain farm fires in the state and elsewhere.It is not merely a matter of financial assistance. ‘Prali’ (stubble) is a ‘vardan’ (a blessing). What is needed more than a cash incentive is awareness, because stubble is beneficial for farmers. They can earn from it by putting it to optimum use.","Union Agriculture Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan met farmers in Punjab.

Confirmation of Ahmedabad as the host city for the 2030 Commonwealth Games (CWG) has sounded the starting gun for an accelerated infrastructure race across the Ahmedabad-Gandhinagar belt. The Commonwealth Sport General Assembly’s approval on Wednesday has pushed the twin cities into delivery mode, with officials stressing that major venue construction plans are locked into a firm timeline.Speaking to the media in Glasgow after Ahmedabad won hosting rights, Gujarat principal secretary (sports, youth and cultural activities) Ashwani Kumar said that the city is poised to be the sports capital of India. “The construction of the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Sports Enclave (SVPSE) and the Police Academy Sports Hub will begin in April 2026 and finish by late 2028 or early 2029,” he said.He announced that funding for both these projects had been secured by the govt and that “most venues for the 2030 Games are ready”. He also said that the “organising committee will be constituted within a month”.Much of the Games’ footprint will be centred on the SVPSE — a purpose-built zone that will anchor Gujarat’s longterm sporting ecosystem.The enclave will house an arena, aquatic centre, tennis courts, training zones, and athlete villages. The Karai Police Academy complex will host athletics, shooting and other disciplines. For Gujarat, the CWG is as much about global visibility as about creating infrastructural and sporting capacity that endures beyond 2030.Unlike some sporting meets that span multiple states, the 2030 Games will be strikingly compact, concentrated almost entirely within the Ahmedabad-Gandhinagar cluster. That will enable faster movement and a lower carbon footprint.“This compactness cuts athlete travel time and allows seamless integration of metro, BRTS and electric mobility,” states the document, ‘Games Vision, Concept and Legacy — Commonwealth Games 2030’, presented before the CWG committee. Only two disciplines — cycling at the Statue of Unity (near Kevadia) and women’s cricket in Vadodara — will take place outside this hub.The Narendra Modi Stadium, the world’s largest cricket stadium, will host the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2030 Games — massive productions that are expected to reflect the Commonwealth Sport values.Beyond the Games, Gujarat — which hosted the National Games in 2022 — is pushing lesser-known disciplines like netball, lawn bowls, kabaddi, and yogasana into the spotlight. The bigger shift is strategic — Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar aim to become year round sports cities, with highperformance labs, community spaces and university-linked infrastructure to ensure post Games utilisation.Ahmedabad also plans to discuss sustainability, diversity and inclusion during the Commonwealth heads of govt meeting (CHOGM) 2026 and 2028.Tejas Joshi, president of Credai Gujarat, said, “Hosting the CWG will be a game changer for Ahmedabad. The city’s infrastructure will see a drastic change with improved roads and connectivity. It will create demand for around 20,000 star-category hotel rooms and boost hotel and retail development. It will also eventually bring new migration to the city, resulting in increased housing demand.”Accommodation is expanding fast. “Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar offer 5,420 hotel rooms in the 3-5 star range, with 3,000 more planned, including 1,500 new 5-star rooms. Upgraded university hostels will house athletes during the Games and serve students later,” states the proposal.Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International (SVPI) airport, handling 13.4 million passengers annually, will add a new terminal by 2026 to double its capacity and introduce e-gates and kiosks.“World-class sports academies will be set up, encouraging a sports culture among city youths. After the Commonwealth Games, Ahmedabad aims to host the 2036 Olympics. The next decade will bring historic developments to the city,” said Joshi.Behind the scenes, athlete development is accelerating. Gujarat’s sports budget has grown from Rs 2.5 crore to Rs 521 crore over two decades, strengthening long-term athlete development pathways and strengthening academies. Part of the focus is also on scaling up talent hunts like Khel Mahakumbh, which saw engagement from 7 million participants, and schemes such as Shaktidoot to support athletes.Public participation will also be a defining layer. Programmes like Active Gujarat will convert riverfronts and parks into fitness zones.At the same time, Sabarmati Sundays — weekly openstreet events — will be expanded in the run-up to 2030. College students will join as youth ambassadors through the National Service Scheme (NSS) and the National Cadet Corps (NCC). By 2030, Gujarat plans to train 10,000 volunteers and create over 30,000 jobs linked to the Games.Journey to hosting CWG 2030",Ahmedabad will host the 2030 Commonwealth Games. The city is also preparing to host the 2036 Olympic Games. Ahmedabad-Gandhinagar belt has been earmarked as the'sports capital' of India. The construction of the Sardar Vallabhai Patel Sports Hub and the Police Enclave will begin in April 2026 and finish by 2028.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125628490,imgsize-73470,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/how-ahmedabads-planning-to-turn-cwg-into-olympic-leap.jpg"
