Three Indians accused of killing Khalistan separatist Nijjar appear before Canadian court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/three-indians-accused-of-killing-khalistan-separatist-nijjar-appear-before-canadian-court/articleshow/109932481.cms,"(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Three Indian nationals , Karan Brar, Kamalpreet Singh, and Karanpreet Singh, appeared before a Canadian court via video on Tuesday to face charges of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder in connection with the killing of Khalistan separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar last year. The suspects, believed to be part of an alleged hit squad, were arrested in Edmonton on Friday.The court proceedings took place at the Surrey Provincial Court in British Columbia, with hundreds of local Khalistan supporters gathering both inside and outside the courthouse.The accused agreed to have the proceedings conducted in English and acknowledged their understanding of the charges against them.The indictments allege that the conspiracy to murder Nijjar unfolded in Surrey and Edmonton between May 1, 2023, and the date of his killing on June 18, 2023. The alleged hitmen had entered Canada over the past five years and were suspected of involvement in drug trafficking and violence.India has rejected recent comments by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on the killing of Nijjar, saying that they illustrate the political space given to separatism, extremism, and violence in Canada. The presence of Sikh separatist groups in Canada has long been a source of frustration for India, which had designated Nijjar a ""terrorist.""External affairs minister S Jaishankar attributed the current situation in Canada to their internal politics and vote bank considerations, with some parties relying on pro-Khalistan leaders for support.“Canada did not give any proof. They do not share any evidence with us in certain cases, police agencies also do not cooperate with us. It is their political compulsion in Canada to blame India. As elections are coming in Canada, they indulge in vote bank politics,” the minister said.He emphasized that India has repeatedly urged Canada not to provide visas, legitimacy, or political space to such individuals, as it causes problems for both countries and their relationship.","Three Indian nationals appeared before a Canadian court via video on Tuesday.

Thalassemia, a hereditary blood disorder, presents a formidable challenge for patients and doctors alike. As a doctor engaged in the care and management of thalassemia patients, it’s important to shed light on thalassemia—its prevention, precautions, and symptoms.World Thalassemia Day , observed on May 8th, raises awareness about thalassemia, a genetic blood disorder characterized by abnormal hemoglobin production.The day aims to educate the public about prevention, treatment, and support for individuals living with thalassemia, emphasizing the importance of genetic testing and access to quality healthcare.Thalassemia encompasses a group of genetic blood disorders characterized by abnormal hemoglobin production, leading to reduced red blood cell count and anemia. This condition predominantly affects individuals of Southeast Asian descent. It manifests in two main types: alpha thalassemia and beta thalassemia, each with varying degrees of severity.Thalassemia's clinical presentation varies widely, ranging from mild anemia to life-threatening complications such as organ damage and failure. Patients may experience fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath, pale skin, jaundice, and bone deformities. Severe cases can lead to growth retardation, enlarged spleen, and an increased risk of infections.Certain populations are more predisposed to thalassemia due to genetic factors. Individuals with a family history of the condition are at higher risks. Additionally, intermarriage within communities carrying the thalassemia gene amplifies the likelihood of offspring inheriting the disorder.Preventing thalassemia necessitates a multifaceted approach encompassing genetic counseling, carrier screening, and prenatal testing.Education plays a pivotal role in empowering individuals to make informed decisions regarding family planning.Screening programs enable early detection of carriers, facilitating intervention and counseling to mitigate the risk of transmission to offspring.For individuals diagnosed with thalassemia, comprehensive care is imperative to optimize outcomes and enhance quality of life. Regular monitoring, blood transfusions, iron chelation therapy, and, in select cases, bone marrow transplantation form the cornerstone of management. Moreover, supportive measures such as nutritional supplementation and psychosocial support are integral components of holistic care.By encouraging awareness, promoting genetic screening, and embracing a collaborative approach to care, we can strive towards better outcomes and improved quality of life for thalassemia patients and their families.","World Thalassemia Day is observed on May 8th.

AstraZeneca says it will withdraw Covid-19 vaccine globally,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/astrazeneca-says-it-will-withdraw-covid-19-vaccine-globally/articleshow/109932487.cms,"(With Reuters input)

NEW DELHI: AstraZeneca on Tuesday announced that it has started the global withdrawal of its Covid-19 vaccine, days after the UK pharmaceutical company admitted that its vaccine has the potential to cause a rare side effect called Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome ( TTS ).The company said the withdrawal was due to a ""surplus of available updated vaccines"" since the pandemic.According to media reports, the Anglo-Swedish drugmaker had previously admitted in court documents that the vaccine causes side effects such as blood clots and low blood platelet counts.The company also said its decision to remove the vaccine Vaxzevria 's marketing authorizations within Europe, noting that this oversupply has resulted in a decrease in demand for Vaxzevria, which is no longer being produced or distributed.""As multiple, variant Covid-19 vaccines have since been developed there is a surplus of available updated vaccines,"" the company said, adding that this had led to a decline in demand for Vaxzevria, which is no longer being manufactured or supplied.AstraZeneca which collaborated with the University of Oxford to create the vaccine is currently dealing with a lawsuit that claims their vaccine has caused deaths and severe harm to those who received it.The UK-based pharma company also collaborated with the Serum Institute of India (SII), the largest vaccine producer globally, to provide the vaccine (Covishield) to the Indian government.The Telegraph, which initially reported the news, said that AstraZeneca's application to withdraw the vaccine was submitted on March 5 and became effective on May 7.Previous year, Jamie Scott, a father of two, took legal action after suffering from a blood clot that left him unable to work. Scott said that he developed a “blood clot and a bleed on his brain”, leaving him with a lasting brain injury following his vaccination in April 2021.According to The Telegraph, Scott’s wife Kate said, ""The medical world has acknowledged for a long time that vaccine-induced immune thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (VITT) was caused by the vaccine.""However, in May 2023, the company informed Scott's lawyers that they do not acknowledge that TTS is induced by the vaccine on a general level.Later in the legal document submitted to the high court, the multinational pharmaceutical company said, ""It is admitted that the AZ vaccine can, in very rare cases, cause TTS. The causal mechanism is not known.""“Our sympathy goes out to anyone who has lost loved ones or reported health problems. Patient safety is our highest priority, and regulatory authorities have clear and stringent standards to ensure the safe use of all medicines, including vaccines,” AstraZeneca said in a statement.“From the body of evidence in clinical trials and real-world data, the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine has continuously been shown to have an acceptable safety profile and regulators around the world consistently state that the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks of extremely rare potential side effects,” it noted.As per the report, fifty-one cases have been filed in the High Court, with affected individuals and their families pursuing compensation amounting to an estimated £100 million.","AstraZeneca has started the global withdrawal of its Covid-19 vaccine.

Star witness

Mistrial request

Salacious details

Cross-examination

Donald Trump ’s intimate moments with an adult film star spilled out into open court on Tuesday as Stormy Daniels described her alleged affair with the former president in a highly-anticipated moment of his hush-money trial.The testimony everybody was waiting for arrived Tuesday morning in Manhattan as Daniels took the stand to tell her story of a 2006 sexual encounter with Trump in a Lake Tahoe hotel suite.“He was wearing silk or satin pajamas that I immediately made fun of,” Daniels said as a prosecutor questioned her about the encounter. “‘Does Hugh Hefner know you stole his pajamas?’” she recalled asking Trump.Her vivid and often graphic testimony included fresh details on a story that has been pored over for years. The scene injected a tabloid-ready moment into the trial, with the adult-film actress confronting the former president before a jury of New Yorkers who will determine his fate.During a break, Judge Juan Merchan privately warned Trump’s lawyer that the ex-president could be heard uttering vulgarities during the testimony, which the judge said he would not tolerate. The day before, Merchan had threatened to jail Trump for continuing to violate a gag order barring him from publicly discussing potential witnesses.“I understand that your client is upset at this point, but he is cursing audibly, and he is shaking his head visually and that’s contemptuous,” Merchan told attorney Todd Blanche, according to a transcript. “It has the potential to intimidate the witness and the jury can see that.”The private and potentially embarrassing details about the night they met — including her mocking of Trump’s silk pajamas and the manner in which he allegedly initiated sex — are likely to infuriate the former president, who has denied the affair and is deeply protective of his public image. What’s less clear is how damaging the revelations will be to his case or his campaign.The remarkable testimony is the latest example of how Trump’s dealings with women are coming back to haunt him in court. Last year, a federal jury in Manhattan found Trump liable for sexually assaulting New York writer E. Jean Carroll in the 1990s. Another jury awarded Carroll $83.3 million in damages to punish Trump for defaming her by denying her allegation of rape.Trump became the presumptive Republican nominee for the November election even after Carroll prevailed in court in her sexual-abuse lawsuit, and his 2016 victory over Hillary Clinton followed a string of damaging revelations about his dealings with women. That included the release of the so-called Access Hollywood tape in which he boasts about sexual assault.Daniels is at the center of a case in which Trump is accused of falsifying business records to conceal the nature of a $130,000 payment to her to keep her quiet before the 2016 election. Her testimony is crucial because the Manhattan district attorney, who brought the case last year, must convince jurors that Trump tried to conceal Daniels’s story before the election.If Daniels can convince jurors that a sexual encounter took place, it can bolster the district attorney’s argument about Trump’s motivation to make the hush-money payment.Many of the details Daniels gave the jury Tuesday have been public for years, but her answers under questioning by prosecutors included new claims that angered the defense, including a suggestion that Daniels felt pressured to have sex with Trump due to a “power imbalance.”Daniels delivered much of her testimony in a colorful demeanor that sometimes bordered on humorous, eliciting frequent laughs from spectators. Daniels avoided looking directly at Trump, even when she walked right by him. For his part, Trump appeared to keep his eyes closed for much of her testimony.Trump and his lawyers mostly let Daniels testify uninterrupted. It wasn’t until after the lunch break, when Trump’s lawyer Blanche seized the opportunity to ask the judge for a mistrial, arguing that the detailed testimony by Daniels had gone too far and prejudiced the jury.Merchan denied the mistrial motion but even so, agreed some of Daniels’s testimony had gone too far. He asked Daniels to stay focused and avoid providing “unnecessary details” in her testimony. He also chided Trump’s lawyers for not objecting to it earlier.Before the jury came back from the break, Judge Merchan told prosecutor Susan Hoffinger that “we don’t need this level of detail, like the color of the floor.”Daniels described how she first met Trump in a Lake Tahoe hotel suite, where she’d been invited after meeting the real estate mogul at a celebrity golf tournament sponsored in part by the adult-film company where she worked. Trump’s bodyguard invited her to Trump’s hotel for dinner and when she arrived at the room, she found Trump in his silk pajamas.Speaking rapidly during her testimony, Daniels was frequently asked to slow down by the judge. She detailed her banter with Trump, describing him as “arrogant.” That prompted Trump to suggest she should spank him, she said.Daniels said she asked Trump about his wife, Melania. He told her not to worry about that and that they “don’t even sleep in the same room.” She said she excused herself to go to the bathroom, and found Trump waiting for her on the bed when she returned.She regretted her decisions that had led her there that night, and said she didn’t disclose her affair with Trump because she felt “ashamed.” The consensual tryst left her shaken, Daniels said, but she stayed in touch with Trump because he promised he’d help her get on his reality TV show, The Apprentice.Daniels said hundreds of people knew of her relationship with Trump, but few knew they had sex. Her story briefly became public in a 2011 gossip blog post. But by 2016, she decided to accept a $130,000 payment from Trump’s lawyer Michael Cohen to keep quiet about the affair.Extorting money from Trump, as the former president has suggested, wasn’t her goal, Daniels testified.“My motivation wasn’t money,” Daniels said. “It was to get the story out.”Trump’s team used cross examination to portray Daniels as a liar who wanted to make money off a fake story about the former president.Trump lawyer Susan Necheles accused Daniels at one point of making up her testimony as she went along, pointing to evidence that she’d told a Los Angeles lawyer she didn’t have sex with Trump, and that she told some entertainment news outlets that the story about the affair was false.“You’re making it up as you sit there, right?” Necheles said.Necheles suggested that Daniels was an extortionist and someone determined to avoid paying Trump more than $500,000 in legal fees she owed him.“You’re looking to extort money from President Trump, right?” Necheles asked.“False,” said Daniels.The lawyer at one point got Daniels to say she hates Trump and that she hopes he’ll go to jail, seeking to convey to the jury that Daniels has biased feelings about Trump.“Am I correct that you hate President Trump?” Necheles asked.“Yes,” Daniels said.“And you want him to go to jail?” Necheles asked.“I want him to be held accountable,” Daniels said.",Stormy Daniels testifies about a 2006 sexual encounter with Donald Trump in a Lake Tahoe hotel suite. The vivid and often graphic testimony included fresh details on a story that has been pored over for years.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

NEW DELHI: The Maldivian tourism minister , Ibrahim Faisal, has appealed to Indian tourists to continue visiting the archipelago nation, emphasising the historical ties between the two countries.In an interview with PTI Videos, Faisal stated, ""We have a history. Our newly elected government also wants to work together (with India). We always promote peace and a friendly environment.Our people and the government will give a warm welcome to Indian arrivals. As the Tourism Minister, I want to tell Indians to please be a part of Maldives' tourism. Our economy depends on tourism.""The minister's plea comes amidst a significant decline in Indian tourist arrivals following derogatory remarks made by three Maldivian officials against India and Prime Minister Narendra Modi on social media.The backlash led to numerous cancellations and a drop in India's position from the top visitor country to the sixth position after January. According to a report by sun.mv, tourist arrivals from India declined by 42 per cent in the first four months of this year compared to the same period last year.The strained relations between India and the Maldives have been attributed to the new administration led by President Mohamed Muizzu, who is widely seen as a pro-China leader.Since assuming office in November last year, Muizzu has maintained his election promise of evicting Indian military personnel from the Maldives, forcing the withdrawal of 88 Indian military personnel manning three aviation platforms gifted by India. Muizzu has previously accused India of meddling in the affairs of the Maldives and won the presidential elections in September last year with an ""India Out"" campaign.Despite the current challenges, the Maldives remains a key maritime neighbour for India in the Indian Ocean Region and holds a special place in India's initiatives like 'SAGAR' and the 'Neighbourhood First Policy' of the Modi government. The Maldivian tourism minister's appeal highlights the importance of maintaining strong bilateral ties and the significance of Indian tourists for the Maldivian economy.",Maldivian tourism minister Ibrahim Faisal has appealed to Indian tourists to continue visiting the archipelago nation.

US Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall flew a fighter jet on Friday that was piloted by AI over the deserts in California, as reported by Fox news.Last month, Kendall announced his intention to pilot an AI-controlled F-16 to the US Senate appropriations committee’s defense panel, discussing the future of air warfare relying on autonomously operated drones.On Friday, the senior Air Force leader carried out his plans, achieving what might be one of the most significant advancements in military aviation since the introduction of stealth planes in the early 1990s.According to Fox news, the US Air Force plans to have more than 1,000 AI-flown planes in commission, with the first in operation by 2028Kendall traveled to Edwards Air Force base, which is the same desert facility where Chuck Yeager broke the sound barrier, to observe and participate in AI flight in real time.""It’s a security risk not to have it. At this point, we have to have it,"" the secretary said.The F-16, controlled by artificial intelligence and named Vista, flew Kendall in maneuvers that reached speeds exceeding 550 mph, exerting a pressure on his body equivalent to nearly five times the force of gravity.A human-piloted F-16 was flying alongside Vista and Kendall. The two jets raced within 1,000 feet of each other, performing twists and loops in an attempt to make their opponent surrender.He said that he had seen sufficient evidence to have faith in the AI technology when determining whether to use weapons in a war.Kendall said that human oversight will always be involved in the consideration of weapons.The US Air Force plans to have a fleet of more than 1,000 AI-operated drones, with the first one expected to be operational by 2028.In March, the Pentagon announced its plans to develop new artificial intelligence-guided planes. It offered two contracts to several private companies for them to compete against each other to win.The CCA project, known as the Collaborative Combat Aircraft project, is a component of a program worth $6 billion.The companies that are competing for the contract are Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, General Atomics, and Anduril Industries.The Pentagon is interested in pursuing the project because cost-cutting is one of the elements of AI that appeals to them.In August 2023, deputy secretary of fefense Kathleen Hicks said deploying AI-enabled autonomous vehicles would provide ""small, smart, cheap and many' expendable units to the US military, helping overhaul the ""too-slow shift of US military innovation.""","US Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall flew a fighter jet on Friday that was piloted by AI over the deserts in California.

"California rebrands, ditches ‘Dream Big’ slogan to avoid making political statement",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/california-rebrands-ditches-dream-big-slogan-to-avoid-making-political-statement/articleshow/109931043.cms,"Perhaps you remember the commercials: images of the glittering blue Pacific, the majestic peaks of Yosemite, storybook vineyards and ancient redwoods stretching toward the sky.For more than 10 years, tourism advertisements have painted California as a place for dreamers, a place for adventure and testing your limits by surfing, rock-climbing and skiing. The state tourism agency, Visit California , led the campaign, which invited people from around the world to "" Dream Big "" and travel to the Golden State.Not anymore.This spring, Visit California replaced ""Dream Big"" with a new campaign and a new brand for the state, as the "" Ultimate Playground ."" The scenes in the ads are much the same as before -- with the addition of the Rady Shell, San Diego's outdoor concert venue that opened in 2021 -- but there's no longer any mention of dreams.Caroline Beteta, the CEO of Visit California, said there were a number of reasons for the switch, including that branding phrases like ""Dream Big"" tend to lose power over time and that the concept of dreaming had been popping up elsewhere, in corporate advertising.Another major driver of the ""Ultimate Playground"" campaign was a more polarized political climate across the United States, which has created antipathy toward California in some parts of the country.Beteta said that the agency's consumer research confirmed that Americans increasingly see the world through a political lens, and that framing California as a place to dream about was striking some viewers as a political statement. ""Ultimate Playground"" seemed to be a safer and less charged message.The new campaign is meant to tap into pent-up demand for excitement and travel after pandemic restrictions. Visit California's research found that 43% of consumers said vacations were the only time they could really let go and play.California's tourism sector was doing well even before the new campaign. Spending by tourists rose to a record-high $150.4 billion in 2023, Gov. Gavin Newsom said over the weekend -- surpassing 2019 and suggesting that the pandemic slump has ended. The surge generated billions of dollars in tax revenue for the state and helped create 64,900 new jobs last year.","Visit California replaced ""Dream Big"" with a new campaign and a new brand for the state.

Boy Scouts of America changing name to more inclusive Scouting America after years of woes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/boy-scouts-of-america-changing-name-to-more-inclusive-scouting-america-after-years-of-woes/articleshow/109925804.cms,"IRVING: The Boy Scouts of America is changing its name for the first time in its 114-year history and will become Scouting America . It's a significant shift as the organization emerges from bankruptcy following a flood of sexual abuse claims and seeks to focus on inclusion .The organization steeped in tradition has made seismic changes after decades of turmoil, from finally allowing gay youth to welcoming girls throughout its ranks.With an eye on increasing flagging membership numbers, the Irving, Texas-based organization announced the name change Tuesday at its annual meeting in Florida.“In the next 100 years we want any youth in America to feel very, very welcome to come into our programs,” Roger Krone, who took over last fall as president and chief executive officer, said in an interview before the announcement.The organization began allowing gay youth in 2013 and ended a blanket ban on gay adult leaders in 2015. In 2017, it made the historic announcement that girls would be accepted as Cub Scouts as of 2018 and into the flagship Boy Scout program — renamed Scouts BSA — in 2019.There were nearly 1,000 young women in the inaugural class of female Eagle Scouts in 2021, including Selby Chipman. The all-girls troop she was a founding member of in her hometown of Oak Ridge, North Carolina, has grown from five girls to nearly 50, and she thinks the name change will encourage even more girls to realize they can join.“Girls were like: ‘You can join Boy Scouts of America?’” said Chipman, now a 20-year-old college student and assistant scoutmaster of her troop.Within days of the announcement that girls would be allowed, Bob Brady went to work. A father of two girls and a proud Eagle Scout himself, the New Jersey attorney eagerly formed an all-girls troop. At their first weekend gathering with other troops, the boys were happy to have the girls involved but some adult leaders seemed concerned, he recalled. Their worries seemed to melt away as soon as the girls led a traditional cheer around the campfire.“You could see a change in the attitude of some of the doubters who weren’t sure and they realized, wait, these kids are exactly the same, they just happen to have ponytails,” said Brady. His daughters are among the 13 girls in his troop and 6,000 girls nationwide who have achieved the vaunted Eagle Scout rank.Like other organizations, the scouts lost members during the pandemic, when participation was difficult. After a highpoint over the last decade of over 2 million members in 2018, the organization currently services just over 1 million youths, including more than 176,000 girls and young women. Membership peaked in 1972 at almost 5 million.The move by the Boy Scouts to accept girls throughout their ranks strained a bond with the Girl Scouts of the USA, which sued, saying it created marketplace confusion and damaged their recruitment efforts. They reached a settlement agreement after a judge rejected those claims, saying both groups are free to use words like “scouts” and “scouting.”While camping remains an integral activity for the Boy Scouts, the organization offers something for everyone today, from high adventures to merit badges for robotics and digital technology, Krone said: “About anything kids want to do today, they can do in a structured way within the scouting program.""The Boy Scouts’ $2.4 billion bankruptcy reorganization plan took effect last year, allowing the organization to keep operating while compensating the more than 80,000 men who say they were sexually abused as children while scouting.Angelique Minett, the first woman chairperson of Scouts BSA, gets excited about the future of scouting when she sees the about 20-person youth council from across the United States help guide the program by raising issues important to them, like sustainability, and things that they'd like to see changed, like the fit on some of the uniforms.“When we think scouts we think knots and camping, but those are a means to an end,"" Minett said. “We are actually teaching kids a much bigger thing. We are teaching them how to have grit, and we’re teaching them life skills and we’re teaching them how to be good leaders.”The organization won't officially become Scouting America until Feb. 8, 2025, the organization's 115th birthday. But Krone said he expects people will start immediately using the name.“It sends this really strong message to everyone in America that they can come to this program, they can bring their authentic self, they can be who they are and they will be welcomed here,” Krone said.","The organization began allowing gay youth in 2013 and ended a blanket ban on gay adult leaders in 2015.

'Met me in satin pants': Stormy Daniels testifies in Trump's hush money case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/met-me-in-satin-pants-stormy-daniels-testifies-in-trump-case/articleshow/109925606.cms,"NEW DELHI: Stormy Daniels , a pornstar, testified in the criminal trial of former US President Donald Trump on Tuesday.She described meeting Trump at a celebrity golf tournament in 2006, where he was wearing satin pajamas when she arrived at his hotel suite, according to a Reuters report.During her testimony, Daniels recounted meeting Trump briefly at a meet and greet with adult actresses and golfers.She initially declined an invitation to join him for dinner but later changed her mind. When she arrived at his suite, Trump greeted her in satin pajamas, to which she quipped, ""Does Hugh Hefner know you stole his pajamas?"" Trump politely obliged when she asked him to change.Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford , is central to the case, which revolves around a $130,000 hush money payment made by Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen , to keep her quiet about an alleged sexual encounter with Trump.Justice Juan Merchan announced prior to her appearance on the stand that Daniels would be permitted to provide a straightforward account of the incident. Susan Necheles, a lawyer representing Trump, raised an objection, contending that the testimony was not directly relevant to a trial primarily focused on financial documents.In response, Prosecutor Susan Hoffinger asserted that Daniels' testimony was necessary to provide a comprehensive narrative and establish her reliability as a witness. She said, “In terms of the sexual act, it will be just very basic. It’s not going to involve descriptions of genitalia or anything of that nature.”Trump, who is running for president again in the upcoming election, has pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. Prosecutors allege that he falsely labeled reimbursement payments to Cohen in 2017 as legal expenses to cover up an illegal scheme to influence the 2016 election by buying the silence of people with potentially damaging information.The former president also received a gag order restricting him from speaking about witnesses, jurors, and others involved in the case if his statements are meant to influence the proceedings. He has been fined $10,000 for violating the order and could face jail time if he continues his attacks.This case is one of four criminal prosecutions Trump currently faces, but it is the only one certain to go to trial before the election. The other cases involve charges of trying to overturn his 2020 presidential defeat and mishandling classified documents after leaving office. Trump has pleaded not guilty to all three.","Stormy Daniels, a pornstar, testified in the criminal trial of former US President Donald Trump on Tuesday.

The Dow Jones' recent gains notwithstanding, Cardone highlighted the alarming trend in the S&P's yield curve, which has been inverted for over 500 days—a historical precursor to significant market downturns including those in 1929, 1974, and 2009.In a recent statement on the social media platform X, Cardone outlined the dire consequences of such a crash, compounded by current inflation rates, which could effectively amplify total losses to feel more like 75%.""WARNING: Stock Market is due for 50 percent correction taking S&P below 2674,"" he cautioned, emphasizing the risk to retirement accounts heavily invested in the stock market at these levels, a Daily Mail report said.Cardone, who has advised companies such as Google and Morgan Stanley, drew parallels between the current market indicators and those that preceded major financial crises in the past. He explained that following the historical crashes, the market declines erased significant value from Americans' 401Ks, affecting their long-term savings and financial security.The financial expert also criticized the Federal Reserve's recent rate hikes, arguing that they have stifled the housing market rather than controlling inflation as intended. ""Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has not controlled inflation. He has failed miserably,"" Cardone said. He suggests that reducing interest rates might rejuvenate the housing market, encouraging more sales and potentially lowering house prices.To safeguard against potential financial turmoil, Cardone recommends transitioning retirement funds from stock market-dependent 401ks to real assets that generate consistent cash flow, such as property investments. He believes this strategy could provide retirees with a more stable and reliable income source.This warning comes as Manhattan sees a drop in rents for the first time since the pandemic, signaling potential shifts in the real estate market that could offer investment opportunities amid economic uncertainties.","Grant Cardone, a seasoned private equity fund manager, has issued a stark warning about an imminent stock market crash that could see values halve.

However, there seems to be an element of hesitancy within the government to engage fully in the investigation, the report noted.A source within the PML-N revealed Nawaz Sharif 's insistence on robust action against the perpetrators, regardless of their political influence. However, there's a noticeable lack of enthusiasm from the current government to involve bodies such as the NAB or FIA in the investigation, despite suggestions, according to Dawn.Information Minister Attaullah Tarar's dismissal of engaging the NAB or FIA raises eyebrows, especially given the magnitude of the alleged scam, which surpasses PKR 500 million, warranting their involvement according to new laws. The government's cautious approach, attributed to the involvement of the former caretaker government, reflects a reluctance to tread on contentious ground.Reports suggesting substantial wheat imports under Shehbaz Sharif's administration post-elections have added another layer to the controversy, the report noted. Denials from government officials contradict the allegations, further complicating the situation. Blame for the wheat crisis is shifted to the caretaker government, distancing the current administration from any culpability.Adding to the confusion are reports of the summoning of former caretaker officials by the fact-finding committee, which were swiftly denied by its head, Kamran Ali Afzal.Tensions continue to escalate within the PML-N, with Hanif Abbasi confronting former caretaker premier Anwaarul Haq Kakar over the wheat scandal. Kakar's veiled threats hint at underlying political manoeuvring, adding intrigue to the unfolding drama. The PTI seized the opportunity to push for a judicial commission, capitalising on the discord within the opposition camp.Amidst the chaos, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif strived to reassure farmers of his unwavering support.His formation of a committee to address farmers' grievances demonstrates a proactive stance, aiming to alleviate concerns regarding wheat procurement, Dawn reported.","The Pakistan government's response to the wheat scam investigation appears to be evasive.

One student is a model. Another is 17 and has no job history.The students vary in age, education level and professional experience. They're all men - Afghan women are banned from studying beyond sixth grade - and they don't know anything about tourism or hospitality.But they are all eager to promote a different side of Afghanistan . And the Taliban are happy to help.Afghanistan's rulers are pariahs on the global stage, largely because of their restrictions on women and girls. The economy is struggling, infrastructure is poor, and poverty is rife.And yet, foreigners are visiting the country, encouraged by the sharp drop in violence, increased flight connections with hubs like Dubai, and the bragging rights that come with vacationing in an unusual destination. The numbers aren't huge - they never were - but there's a buzz around Afghan tourism.In 2021, there were 691 foreign tourists . In 2022, that figure rose to 2,300. Last year, there were 7,000.Mohammad Saeed, the head of the Tourism Directorate in Kabul, said the biggest foreign visitor market is China because of its proximity and large population. Afghanistan also has advantages over some of its neighbors.""They've told me they don't want to go to Pakistan because it's dangerous and they get attacked. The Japanese have said this to me also,"" Saeed said. ""This is good for us.""But there are disadvantages, too.Visas are difficult and expensive to access. Many countries severed ties with Afghanistan after the Taliban returned to power, and no country recognizes them as the legitimate rulers of the country.Afghan embassies either closed or suspended their operations. There's an ongoing power struggle between Afghanistan's embassies and consulates staffed by people from the former Western-backed administration, and those under the Taliban administration's full control.Saeed concedes there are obstacles for Afghan tourism to develop but said he was working with ministries to overcome them.His ultimate aim is to have a visa on arrival for tourists, but that could be years away. There are problems with the road network, which is half-paved or non-existent in some parts of the country, and airlines largely avoid Afghan airspace.The capital Kabul has the most international flights, but no Afghan airport has direct routes with major tourist markets like China, Europe, or India.Despite the challenges, Saeed wants Afghanistan to become a tourism powerhouse, an ambition that appears to be backed by the Taliban's top leaders.""I have been sent to this department on the instructions of the elders (ministers). They must trust me because they've sent me to this important place.""The students also have aspirations. The model, Ahmed Massoud Talash, wants to learn about Afghanistan's picturesque spots for Instagram posts and its history for media appearances.Business school graduate Samir Ahmadzai wants to open a hotel but thinks he should know more about tourism and hospitality first.""They hear that Afghanistan is backwards, poverty and all about war,"" said Ahmadzai. ""We have 5,000 years of history. There should be a new page of Afghanistan.""Classes include Afghan handicrafts and anthropology basics.An unofficial subject is how to interact with foreign women and how their behavior or habits could clash with local customs and edicts. Examples might be women smoking or eating in public, to mixing freely with men who are not related to them by blood or marriage.The Taliban have imposed a dress code for women and requirements for them to have a male guardian, or mahram, when they travel. Dining alone, traveling alone, and socializing with other women in public have become harder. With gyms closed to women and beauty salons banned, there are fewer places where they can meet outside the home.In a sign that the country is preparing for more overseas visitors, the country's only five-star hotel, the Serena, has reopened its women's spa and salon for foreign females after a monthslong closure.Foreigners must show their passport to access services. Women with ""born in Afghanistan"" on their ID are barred.The restrictions on Afghan women and girls weigh on overseas travel companies, who say they try to focus on the positive aspect of cultural interactions by making donations, supporting local projects or only visiting family-run businesses.Shane Horan, the founder of Rocky Road Travel, said visiting Afghanistan should not be seen as an endorsement of any particular government or political regime.""Ultimately, the goal should be to support responsible tourism practices that contribute positively to the local economy and foster mutual respect and understanding, while also remaining cognizant of the broader political context in Afghanistan.""He said there was no input from authorities about what tour groups saw or did, and that the company worked closely with a women's rights organization in Afghanistan. A percentage of the tour cost went into supporting this organization's programs, Horan added.There are no women at the Institute of Tourism & Hotel Management. The students don't mention it. But an official at the Tourism Directorate does.""It's a heartbreaking situation,"" said the official, who wished to remain anonymous for fear of reprisals. ""Even female family members ask if they can study here. But there was a change in policy with the change in government. The women who were studying before (the takeover) never came back. They never graduated.""","Afghanistan's rulers are pariahs on the global stage, largely because of their restrictions on women and girls. The economy is struggling, infrastructure is poor, and poverty is rife. But foreigners are visiting the country, encouraged by the sharp drop in violence.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109714068,imgsize-1602274,width-400,resizemode-4/109714068.jpg"
New report claims India’s rise on world stage under PM Modi is 'a mirage',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/new-report-claims-indias-rise-on-world-stage-under-pm-modi-is-a-mirage/articleshow/109931366.cms,"LONDON: A new report called “Modi Mirage”, produced by academics in the US, Netherlands and UK, says that Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’s claim of having dramatically enhanced India’s standing in the world is “a mirage”.The report asserts that global audiences , particularly in Europe, view India significantly less favourably under Modi than in the years before he came to power, and that the PM’s popularity abroad is lower than BJP claims.“Modi Mirage”, co-authored by Prof Irfan Nooruddin from Georgetown University, US, and Dr Ritumbra Manuvie from Groningen University, the Netherlands with Dr Subir Sinha from London’s SOAS as principle adviser, in collaboration with not-for-profit Friends of Democracy, relies on a synthesis of recent research by the Pew Research Center in the US, Carnegie, Canadian consultancy GlobeScan, US poll firm GQY and UK’s YouGov.It claims that in both the US and UK, Modi is neither well known nor popular, and refers to a recent YouGov poll in which he was ranked in both countries below the highly disliked figures in those countries of Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping. In UK just 10% view Modi favourably, the poll, based on a sample of adults, claims.It cites another poll from YouGov that found 80% of Indians are concerned for the health of their democracy. It blames a lack of press freedom in India as the reason for the mirage and calls on India to change course toward greater respect for human rights and democratic norms.The report claims that 52% of British Indians don't like Modi, based on polling by GQR, and that 65% of British Indians rate religious violence allegedly promoted by Modi spilling over to the UK as a top concern.The report also claims the majority of people in the US, UK and France are concerned about the state of human rights and democracy in India, alleged attempts by India to assassinate US and Canadian citizens on home soil, and new laws which make it harder for Muslims to become citizens of India, and says they want to see human rights as conditions of trade deals.“State machinery is being used to oppress the opposition…while BJP leaders enjoy total impunity,” it claims.","A new report called “Modi Mirage’, produced by academics in the US, Netherlands and UK, says that Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’s claim of having dramatically enhanced India’s standing in the world is ‘a mirage’ The report asserts that global audiences, particularly in Europe, view India significantly less favourably under Modi than in the years before he came to power.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109931351,imgsize-1483632,width-400,resizemode-4/109931351.jpg"
UK court rejects bail application of Nirav Modi for fifth time,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-court-rejects-bail-application-of-nirav-modi-for-fifth-time/articleshow/109924244.cms,"NEW DELHI: The UK Westminster Magistrate’s court rejected the bail application of fugitive Nirav Modi on Tuesday for the fifth time . Nirav Modi had filed the application citing long incarceration.According to ED sources, ""Nirav Modi filed a bail application on 16th April for the 5th time before the Westminster Magistrate’s Court in the UK citing long incarceration, but it was dismissed during the hearing today and he continues to be in detention.""District Judge John Zani accepted their legal team's submission that the long passage of time since the last bail application three and a half years ago constituted a change in circumstances to allow the hearing to go ahead.""However, I am satisfied that there remain substantial grounds against bail. There continues to be a real, substantial risk that the applicant [Nirav Modi] would fail to attend court or interfere with witnesses,"" concluded Judge Zani in his judgment after a short hearing.""This case involves, by any footing, a very substantial fraud allegation... not one where bail can be granted and the application is refused,"" he said.The court heard that while Modi had lost his legal fight against being extradited, there were ""confidential"" proceedings ongoing which had been instigated by him. This would indicate an asylum application but the only indirect reference made to it in court was when the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), appearing on behalf of the Indian authorities, dismissed the assertion that the UK Home Secretary may ""never be able to order extradition"" as incorrect.""He has demonstrated his complete determination to not face the allegations in an Indian court and it is no exaggeration to say the fraud in question is over USD 1 billion, of which only USD 400 million has been seized. Therefore, he could still have access to significant resources in various jurisdictions,"" CPS barrister Nicholas Hearn told the court.""His detention has simply been too long for allegations of economic offences,"" argued Fitzgerald, claiming that his client no longer posed any alleged threats of interfering with witnesses as there had been no such activity despite him having phone access in prison over the years.He also pointed to the ""well established"" history of Modi's mental problems, including depression and suicide risk, which had deteriorated further due to incarceration first at Wandsworth prison, south-west London, and now at Thameside, south-east London.The judge acknowledged that Fitzgerald had made the case ""forcefully and fairly"" and that Modi had not yet been convicted of any crime as that was a ""matter for the Indian judicial system"". However, he aligned with the CPS assertion that he was at the ""epicentre"" of the fraud allegations in which many of his co-defendants in India had been granted bail.(with input from agency)","The UK Westminster Magistrate’s court rejected the bail application of fugitive Nirav Modi on Tuesday for the fifth time.

Cyberattack hits UK defence ministry targeting armed forces' personnel data,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/details-of-uk-military-personnel-exposed-in-huge-payroll-data-breach/articleshow/109911714.cms,"NEW DELHI: The UK's ministry of defence has been hit by cyberattack , affecting the personal information and bank details of armed forces personnel, as confirmed by work and pensions minister Mel Stride on Tuesday.The attack targeted a system operated by a third-party company, highlighting the severity of the incident.According to former minister Tobias Ellwood, the attack targeted a payroll system used by the defence ministry and alleged that it exhibited characteristics of a Chinese cyberattack.""Targeting the names of the payroll system and service personnel's bank details, this does point to China because it can be as part of a plan, a strategy to see who might be coerced,"" said Ellwood, an ex-soldier and former chairman of a parliamentary defence committee on BBC radio.The personal addresses of current and former armed forces members are believed to have been exposed in some instances due to the breach.Stride assured that the affected database had been swiftly removed from the internet by the defence ministry, according to statement given to Sky News. However, the government has not directly accused Beijing of being responsible for the attack at this time. ""That is an assumption.... we are not saying that at this precise moment,"" Stride clarified.In March, the UK government accused China of targeting the Electoral Commission and lawmakers' email accounts. The Electoral Commission attack, discovered in October 2022, allowed hackers to access the commission's systems for over a year before detection. China strongly denied the allegations, calling them ""malicious slander"".Mandiant, a Google subsidiary, reported in June of the previous year that online attackers with clear ties to China were responsible for a widespread cyberespionage campaign targeting government agencies of interest to Beijing. The United States has also frequently accused China of conducting cyberattacks against American targets.Two British men, including a former UK parliamentary researcher, recently appeared in a London court, facing charges of spying for China.

UK PM Sunak promises to work 'as hard as ever' after disastrous local elections,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-pm-sunak-promises-to-work-as-hard-as-ever-after-disastrous-local-elections/articleshow/109857373.cms,"NEW DELHI: British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak on Sunday vowed to persevere ""as diligently as ever"" following a dismal election outcome that witnessed his Conservative party losing ground across various local authorities and even relinquishing a mayoral stronghold in England's West Midlands region.The British Indian leader expressed his disappointment as Andy Street, the Conservative Party's well-liked mayor of West Midlands, narrowly succumbed to Labour opponent Richard Parker by a mere 1,508 votes, prompting a recount for the closely contested outcome.This outcome leaves Sunak with a solitary glimmer of optimism in Ben Houchen, who managed to retain the party's mayoralty in Tees Valley on Friday amidst a near-complete dominance by Opposition parties, spearheaded by Labour.""It's been disappointing of course to lose dedicated Conservative councillors and Andy Street in the West Midlands, with his track record of providing great public services and attracting significant investment to the area, but that has redoubled my resolve to continue to make progress on our plan,"" British PM said in a statement.""So we will continue working as hard as ever to take the fight to Labour and deliver a brighter future for our country,"" he said.As Tory rebels gather momentum, their focus appears to be shifting from replacing Sunak as party leader to pressuring him to take a tougher stance on core party issues, such as implementing a cap on legal migration and significantly reducing taxes. Leading this push is former home secretary Suella Braverman, who delivered a scathing critique in 'The Daily Telegraph,' urging Sunak to transition away from ""managerialism"" and demonstrate resolute leadership.""Let me cut to the chase so no one wastes time over-analysing this: we must not change our leader. Changing leader now won't work: the time to do so came and went. The hole to dig us out is the PM's, and it's time for him to start shovelling,"" expressed the sacked Indian-origin ex-minister, who is at the forefront of the backbench rebellion.""Either we start fighting to win now, or we'll have no one else to blame when this week's political earthquake is made to look like a mere tremor come the general election night,"" she said.Others have joined in to urge Sunak to ""wake up and smell the coffee,"" pointing to the local election results indicating that the Labour Party is poised for success in an upcoming general election, anticipated later this year.Opposition leader Sir Keir Starmer has celebrated his party's ""phenomenal result,"" highlighted by Labour's Sadiq Khan securing a historic third term as London Mayor on Friday.However, Starmer also reached out to voters who expressed discontent over the party's perceived inadequacy in addressing the Israel-Gaza conflict. Analysis revealed that Labour faced setbacks in areas with significant Islamic populations, where voters opted for independents and the anti-war Worker's Party of Britain.""I have heard you. I have listened. And I am determined to meet your concerns and to gain your respect and trust again in the future,"" said Starmer.Overall, the Labour camp will be rejoicing this weekend as it virtually dominated the mayoral elections across England, securing victories in Liverpool, South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, and Greater Manchester.With the majority of results now tallied from Thursday's local council elections, Labour appears poised to claim over 1,100 seats. The Liberal Democrats surpassed the Tories, securing over 500 seats, while the Conservatives suffered losses of around 400 previously held seats of local councillors. These councillors oversee day-to-day matters such as waste collection, roads, local infrastructure, and crime prevention.(With inputs from agencies)","British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak vows to persevere ""as diligently as ever"" British Indian leader expressed his disappointment as Andy Street, the Conservative Party's well-liked mayor of West Midlands, narrowly succumbed to Labour opponent Richard Parker.
