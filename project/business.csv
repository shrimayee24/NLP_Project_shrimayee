'MSP for stubble should be fixed': Congress leader Bhupinder Singh Hooda,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/msp-for-stubble-should-be-fixed-congress-leader-bhupinder-singh-hooda/articleshow/114388115.cms,"CHANDIGARH: Addressing the issue of stubble burning , Congress leader Bhupinder Singh Hooda stated that a Minimum Support Price ( MSP ) should be set for stubble, highlighting its various potential uses, according to the PRO.Hooda on Saturday, said, ""MSP for stubble should be fixed. The question is, what will small farmers do with the stubble? Not purchasing crops from farmers is wrong. A solution must be found for this.Stubble has numerous other uses, including electricity generation. It needs to be utilised effectively.""Earlier on Saturday, environmentalist Vimlendu Jha pointed out that stubble burning was one of the primary causes of increased pollution in North India.Speaking to ANI, Jha remarked, ""Stubble burning is one of the reasons for the rise in air pollution in North India. In addition to this, Delhi has yet to experience the winds from Punjab. The local sources of pollution here are dust and vehicular emissions. Both the state and central governments need to collaborate to find solutions.""However, Jha also emphasised that the primary causes of pollution in Delhi were vehicular emissions and dust.""Roadside dust contributes 30%, and public vehicles account for another 30% of the pollution. Stubble burning only lasts for 25-30 days. The rest of the year, local factors are the main contributors to pollution,"" he explained.On October 16, the Supreme Court summoned the Chief Secretaries of Punjab and Haryana, demanding an explanation as to why legal action had not been taken against stubble burning in their states.Recent figures from Punjab and Haryana show an increase in stubble burning over the past week compared to last year, raising alarms as another Delhi winter approaches.Stubble burning has become a critical concern in Delhi, as the winter season traps pollutants, leading to hazardous air quality and dense smog. The burning of crop residue in neighbouring states significantly exacerbates pollution, posing serious health risks to residents.","Stubble burning has become a critical concern in Delhi, as the winter season traps pollutants, leading to hazardous air quality and dense smog.

Accidents killed 474 daily on average in 2023,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/accidents-killed-474-daily-on-average-in-2023/articleshow/114384171.cms,"NEW DELHI: Over 1.7 lakh persons were killed in road accidents in 2023. That translates to an average of 474 lives lost every day or one death almost every three minutes, as per data shared by states with central govt. This is the highest number of people killed in a year since govt started collating road accident data at the national level to assess the extent of the problem and reasons behind crashes .The data also indicates how the burden of injuries due to road crashes is also on the rise as last year, a maximum of nearly 4.63 lakh people were left injured, which was 4% more than in 2022.In 2022, the number of road fatalities stood at over 1.6 lakh as per the report published by road transport ministry while data collated by National Crime Record Bureau had put the number of fatalities at 1.7 lakh. Both the agencies have not yet published the road accident data for 2023.TOI has learnt that at least 21 states and UTs, including UP, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Punjab, Assam and Telangana, recorded an increase in road deaths compared to 2022 while there was a marginal decline in fatalities in states/UTs such as Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Delhi, Kerala and Chandigarh.","This is the highest number of people killed in a year since govt started collating road accident data.

Extradition of ex-RAW agent Vikash Yadav may take years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/extradition-of-ex-raw-agent-may-take-years/articleshow/114383618.cms,"India may send US Headley extradition reminder

NEW DELHI: The arrest of Vikash Yadav , a former RAW officer who has been accused by the US of masterminding a plot to kill pro-Khalistan separatist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun on American soil, may complicate efforts by the US to get him extradited.While a US move to secure the extradition of Yadav looks to be a logical corollary of the decision to put him on the “most wanted” list, Delhi Police ’s allegation about his complicity in offences of robbery and kidnapping, each punishable with 10 years, may prove to be a tough obstacle.Yadav, an assistant commandant with CRPF before he joined RAW on deputation, was held in Dec last year. He is out on regular bail and is sure to contest the charge that he took to serious crime after being discharged from service due to the US allegations.Going by the speed at which such cases move in Indian courts, it might be quite a while before the case is adjudicated.Yadav can be extradited only after the conclusion of the trial and not before he, if adjudged guilty, has served his sentence.There are also indications that India may send another reminder to the US about its pending request for the extradition of David Coleman Headley, aka Dawood Gilani, an operative of Lashkar-e-Toiba , who conducted recce for the gang that carried out the bloody 26/11 rampage in Mumbai, killing over 150 innocent civilians who, importantly, included US citizens. A US citizen of Pakistani origin who also worked as an informant for the US Drug Enforcement Agency, Dawood had travelled to India on a US passport to dodge the scrutiny that Pakistani nationals are subjected to.India’s request for the extradition of Tahawwur Rana , a Canadian travel agent of Pakistani origin who helped the Lashkar plot by arranging for tickets for Headley, is also pending. While the US court has cleared Rana’s extradition from a Los Angeles prison, his lawyers have deployed fresh tricks to frustrate India’s effort to face the law here.Rana had filed a habeas corpus petition to oppose his extradition, but it was rejected, and the extradition was approved last year. In its ruling, the panel also held that India had presented adequate and competent evidence to back the magistrate judge’s determination of probable cause that Rana was involved in the charged crimes. The jury found him guilty of providing material support to a foreign terrorist organisation and conspiring to support an abortive Lashkar plot in Denmark.Of the two, handing over Headley, currently in Chicago prison, may be more difficult for the US because of his deep links with DEA which appears to have led to overlooking of signs pointing to his links with LeT.Last year, Vikash Yadav and his alleged associates were booked on charges of robbery and kidnapping for ransom on the complaint of one Rajkumar Walia, the owner of Markaz Cafe and Lounge in Delhi. Both offences carry a punishment of 10 years.In his complaint, Walia had alleged Yadav and his aide Abdullah Khan had abducted him in an Ertiga car and taken him to a room in Defence Colony in south Delhi. Once there, Walia was informed that his Dubai-based rival named Jalaluddin alias Sameer had ordered a hit on him and that the matter could be settled if he paid money. They allegedly demanded Rs 20 lakh and took away Rs 50,000, besides a chain and a ring.","Former RAW officer Vikash Yadav has been accused by the US of masterminding a plot to kill pro-Khalistan separatist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun on American soil.

Nagpur’s bomb bazaar makes explosive profits,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nagpurs-bomb-bazaar-makes-explosive-profits/articleshow/114383436.cms,"Nagpur companies shipped out Rs 900 crore arms in 3 months, Rs 3,000 crore to go

NAGPUR: As the flash of guns light up the Russia-Ukraine war front and rockets fly in West Asia, cash registers are ringing at explosives manufacturing units in Nagpur, more than 4,500 km from the battle zones. The city is already informally known as India’s explosives capital where representatives of global arms corporations window-shop along a 30-km stretch on Nagpur’s outskirts.The buyers thronging Nagpur are mostly from Bulgaria, Spain, Germany, South Africa, Vietnam, Poland, Brazil, and even Saudi Arabia.There are no conflicts in these countries, yet there’s huge demand from them. These countries are stashing ammunition on a war footing.Sources told TOI the final destination of these munitions could be somewhere else. Shells of 155mm calibre, fired from howitzer guns, and 40mm shoulder-fired rockets have high demand, say top sources in the business. In the last three months, orders for Rs 900 crore worth of shells, rockets and other bombs have been dispatched and orders of at least Rs 3,000 crore are under execution. A similar count is expected for raw explosive powder, say industry sources.From listed companies and mid-sized ancillary units to newly formed defence public sector undertakings, it’s raining orders. “No, we aren’t supplying even a single round of ammo to any nation at war,” the manufacturers insist.Buyers from other countries are issuing end-use certificates and, based on these, Indian manufacturers are getting govt licences to sell. Exports are banned to certain countries due to geo-political equations, said top arms industry sources.Since countries are issuing end-use certificates, it means the munitions are for their own consumption. Officially, the Indian military industry is not profiteering from war, said manufacturers here. The ministry of commerce maintains district-wise export figures. Data from fiscal 2021-22 till the current fiscal is available on the website.This year, there is a new category in the export list from Nagpur: bombs and grenades. Bombs worth Rs 770 crore have been exported from Nagpur from April to June. Figures for the next quarter are yet to be compiled. Consignments were sent from neighbouring Chandrapur district, too, over the last two years. In the last fiscal, consignments of bombs worth Rs 458 crore were sent out from Chandrapur. The value of exports from April to June this year stands at Rs 171 crore for the district.The bombs and grenades category stands for complete ammunition. These are ready-to-fire rounds. In Nagpur, Yantra India Ltd (YIL), a PSU formed out of Ordnance Factory Ambhajhari three years ago, makes shells. In 1999, when India fell short of shells during the Kargil war, the same unit stepped up production on a war footing to feed the Bofors guns that changed the game on the glaciers.Another PSU, Munitions India Ltd (MIL), has ordnance factories at Chandrapur and Bhandara that load shells with explosives. Both public corporations (MIL & YIL) share a symbiotic relationship and have a fat export order book these days, say sources.This is just one aspect, say sources in the business. Apart from ammunition-like shells and rockets, there is great demand globally for high-energy raw material too, which Nagpur companies are catering to. Here, the private sector also has a major say. Solar Industries is one of the major players in this product category, along with MIL, a PSU.TOI also accessed records maintained by private portals on the basis of export filings made by exporters to govt agencies. It shows sizeable exports of raw materials for manufacturing rockets, shells and bombs — HMX, RDX and TNT. The raw powder was sold to arms corporations across Europe, the Far East, and West Asia, shows data from official records.","In the last three months, orders for Rs 900 crore worth of shells, rockets and other bombs have been dispatched and orders of at least Rs 3,000 crore are under execution.

NEW DELHI: Actor Tamannaah Bhatia was questioned by the ED in Guwahati on Thursday in connection with a money laundering case probe linked to the ' HPZ Token ' mobile app in which several investors were allegedly duped on the pretext of mining Bitcoins and some other cryptocurrencies.The Enforcement Directorate said the statement of the 34-year-old actor was recorded under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) at its zonal office in Guwahati.Sources said Bhatia received some funds for making a ""celebrity appearance"" at an event of the app company and there were no ""incriminating"" charges against her.She was called earlier too but she deferred the summons due to work and chose to appear on Thursday, they said.A total of 299 entities, including 76 Chinese-controlled entities in which 10 directors are of Chinese origin while two entities are controlled by other foreign nationals, have been named as accused in the charge sheet filed by the ED in this case in March.The money laundering case stems from an FIR of the cyber crimes unit of Kohima Police that booked various accused under sections of the Indian Penal Code, the Information Technology Act for allegedly duping ""gullible"" investors by promising astronomical returns by mining Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies.Police said the 'HPZ Token' mobile phone application was used by the accused to ""cheat"" the investors.The agency said bank accounts and merchant IDs were opened by various ""shell entities"" having ""dummy"" directors for the purpose of ""layering"" the proceeds of crime.These funds were ""fraudulently"" received for illegal online gaming and betting and investment for Bitcoin mining , it claimed.For an investment of Rs 57,000, returns of Rs 4,000 per day for three months were promised but money was paid only once and thereafter fresh funds were sought by the accused from the investors, the ED said.Country-wide searches were undertaken by the ED in this case leading to the seizure of immovable assets and deposits worth Rs 455 crore, it said.",Tamannaah Bhatia was questioned by the ED in Guwahati on Thursday in connection with a money laundering case probe linked to the'HPZ Token'mobile app. The Enforcement Directorate said the statement of the actor was recorded under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114332903,imgsize-39750,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/114332903.jpg"

The US govt, at present, is not pursuing trade agreements with any country.India, along with the US, Australia and Japan are working to secure the critical minerals supply chain, ranging from mining to processing and final use as they seek to catch up with China that controls most of the mines and production facilities.

North American Sikh organisation calls for dialogue between India and Canada amidst rising tension,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/north-american-sikh-organisation-calls-for-dialogue-between-india-and-canada-amidst-rising-tension/articleshow/114366526.cms,"Satnam Singh Chahal

The escalating diplomatic tension between India and Canada will have a serious fallout for the Sikh community , not just in Canada, but in the US and in other countries around the world too, feels Satnam Singh Chahal , founder executive director, North American Punjabi Association ( NAPA ).“Constructive dialogue between India and Canada is the pressing need to safeguard the rights and well-being of the Sikh community across both nations and globally,” Chahal, who lives in northern California, told the Times of India, speaking as a representative of NAPA, a global non-partisan and non-sectarian organisation, founded in 2011, dedicated to serving and empowering the Indian diaspora worldwide.Chahal feels that the strong differences between India and Canada, that started with the murder of Khalistan activist Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Surrey, Canada; have highlighted the existing challenges faced by the Sikh diaspora community in western countries regarding issues of identity, safety, and political representation . “We are deeply concerned about the potential ramifications of strained diplomatic relations between India and Canada on the Sikh diaspora, which has long been a bridge between vibrant cultures,” Chahal, who was a nominated commissioner of Santa Clara county in California, said.Born and raised in Punjab, Chahal, who immigrated to the US with his family in 1997, feels that the growing animosity between India and Canada has been hitting the Sikh community hard in Canada as well as the US. “Globally, the Sikhs have been known for our philanthropic activities and service to the community wherever we are based. But now, the present acrimonious situation has created a deep rift even within some of our gurdwaras. The foundation of our religion is the concept of ‘sewa’ and we are a religious group that helps others always with service towards the larger community,” he said. But Chahal finds that the recent tensions, which have been highlighted by the falling out between the Indian and Canadian governments, have led to a changing perception about the Sikh community in North America.The killing of Nijjar, and the following stand-off between India and Canada, has exacerbated an existing divide within the Sikh diaspora, Chahal feels. “Some community members view the Canadian government’s stance as a legitimate defence of human rights, while others see it as an affront to India’s sovereignty. This polarisation can create rifts within families and social circles, leading to heated discussions and estrangement,” he said.He added that there was a lack of outreach to the Sikh community, in the US, on the part of the Indian government in the past several months. “All these factors have been hitting the American Sikh community hard with growing incidents of discrimination and racism being reported at schools, universities and workplaces by younger members of the community who wear turbans and have beards,” Chahal said.He added that in North America, many Sikh families are having to navigate complex relationships with non-Sikh neighbours and friends. “Misunderstandings about the community’s political affiliations can lead to stigmatisation or social isolation, especially if there are perceptions that they support militant factions. Within the diaspora, there can be significant pressure to take sides in the political narrative. Activists may push for solidarity with Nijjar’s cause, while others may urge caution to maintain good relations with India, particularly for those with family ties back home. Further, social media has amplified voices within the community, creating echo chambers where certain narratives dominate,” Chahal said.He feels that Sikhs in America and Canada are depending on the support of the US, Canadian and Indian governments to face such challenges and adds that many Sikhs in Canada, too, are feeling anxious about their safety and the possibility of backlash as tensions rise between India and Canada. “NAPA calls on both the Indian and Canadian governments to ensure the protection of all communities, particularly minorities. Our organisation also urges community members to engage actively in the political process, advocating for their rights and ensuring their voices are heard in discussions that impact their future,” Chahal added.","The escalating diplomatic tension between India and Canada will have a serious fallout for the Sikh community, says Satnam Singh Chahal, founder executive director, North American Punjabi Association. “We are deeply concerned about the potential ramifications of strained diplomatic relations,” he said.

Supreme Court refuses to extend child marriage ban to all faiths,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-refuses-to-extend-child-marriage-ban-to-all-faiths/articleshow/114363674.cms,"SC refuses to rule on PCMA as sought by Centre



NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Friday spurned the Union govt’s invitation to direct application of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act (PCMA) to citizens irrespective of their religion and personal laws but suggested that Parliament should consider outlawing child betrothals as well.Delivering a 141-page judgment on a PIL highlighting the persistence of child marriages on an alarming scale despite enactment of PCMA 18 years ago, a bench of Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud and Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra said, “The issue of the interface of personal laws with the prohibition of child marriage under PCMA has been subject of some confusion.”Union govt, through ASG Aishwarya Bhati, had in a written note on behalf of WCD ministry submitted that there were conflicting opinions of HCs on precedence of PCMA over personal laws.“SC may consider issuing directions pronouncing that PCMA will prevail over the personal law governing marriage,” it requested.Authoring the judgment, CJI Chandrachud said Centre has not provided details of conflicting judgments from HCs and that PCMA was silent on the validity of child marriages. “Prohibition of Child Marriage (Amendment) Bill, 2021, was introduced on Dec 21, 2021. The bill was referred for examination to department-related standing committee. The bill sought to amend PCMA to expressly state the overriding effect of the statute over various personal laws. The issue, therefore, is pending consideration before Parliament,” SC said, refraining from ruling as requested by Centre.However, it laid down elaborate guidelines to strengthen measures to prevent child marriages. The CJI-led bench widened the scope of issue before its consideration to bring in betrothal of minors, and said PCMA was silent on this issue. “Marriages fixed in the minority of a child have the effect of violating their rights to free choice, autonomy, agency and childhood. It takes away from them their choice of partner and life paths before they mature and form the ability to assert their agency. International law such as CEDAW stipulates against betrothals of minors,” it said.“Parliament may consider outlawing child betrothals, which may be used to evade penalty under PCMA. While a betrothed child may be protected as a child in need of care and protection under the JJ Act, the practice also requires targeted remedies for its elimination,” the apex court bench added.Appreciating efforts of advocate Mugdha, appearing for the NGO ‘Society for Enlightenment and Voluntary Action’, in bringing to the court’s notice loopholes in implementation of PCMA, the bench said a studied approachby all stakeholders was needed for prevention of child marriages and protection of minors while penalising approach for violation of PCMA should be last resort.",Supreme Court spurned the Union govt’s invitation to direct application of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act (PCMA) It suggested that Parliament should consider outlawing child betrothals as well.

Its other key suggestion, made in July this year, was to amend the DGCA Civil Aviation Requirements to put hoax callers on ""no-fly"" list for five years.As of now, the rules cover only unruly passengers travelling or boarding aircraft, not non-passengers, and leave it to the airline to decide on duration of the 'no-fly' ban. BCAS had said Indian Penal Code (IPC) provisions are not deterrent enough in the light of the serious impact hoax calls and messages, mostly from pranksters, tend to have on flight schedules and the related losses, besides the inconvenience caused to the passengers and public.BCAS is said to have submitted that introducing a dedicated provisions in the Aircraft Act, 1934, against hoax calls, including stricter bail and stern punishment, would keep pranksters from making that hoax call or posting a false bomb threat.The Bill to amend the Aircraft Act, 1934 - the Bharatiya Vayuyan Vidheyak, 2024 - was passed by the Lok Sabha in August this year. The bill, however, did not incorporate the BCAS suggestion to include a dedicated legal framework to deal with hoax bomb threats to flights.Aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu said Thursday ""a strict barrier"" was being created for ""people trying to do these kinds of pranks"" and hinted at changes in rules and legislation to achieve this.","Aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu said Thursday ""a strict barrier"" was being created for ""people trying to do these kinds of pranks"" Aviation ministry is taking a fresh look at old suggestions of the Bureau of Civil Aviation and Security.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114383304,imgsize-1299043,width-400,resizemode-4/114383304.jpg"

MUMBAI: In a night-long operation, Mumbai crime branch arrested five suspected members of the Maharashtra module of Lawrence Bishnoi’s gang allegedly involved in the killing of NCP politician Baba Siddique , taking the total arrests to nine.Three of them — Sambhaji Parthi (44), Pradeep Thombre (37), Chetan Pardhi (27) — are from Ambernath.Nitin Sapre (32) was picked up from Dombivli and Ramphoolchand Kanojia (43) from Panvel.Police said Sapre and Kanojia were tasked with the hit on Siddique.The plan was later dropped — sources said they demanded Rs 50 lakh-Rs 1 crore as supari, and Sapre developed cold feet on finding out who the target was.An official said Sapre claimed that on finding out how influential Siddique was, “he got scared and understood the consequences and convinced Kanojia to stay away”.The handlers then decided to use the north India module for the job and chose Gurmail Singh, Shivkumar Gautam and Dharmaraj Kashyap,” said the official. While Singh and Kashyap carried out the hit and were caught the same night a little distance, Gautam is on the run.The five from the Maharashtra module are suspected of supplying weapons, including Turkish, Australian and locally made pistols, to the shooters. They also arranged logistics, accommodation and financial support for the killing, said a senior crime branch official. “When Kashyap and Gautam arrived in Karjat, their accommodation was arranged by these arrested accused in mid-Aug.This group had provided logistics and money to the shooters. In mid-Sept, these accused provided three weapons, which have been seized, to the killers. We are also probing if the five arrested accused had visited Mumbai before Siddique’s killing,” said the officer. All five were produced before a court Friday evening and remanded in police custody till Oct 25. Mumbai police Friday suspended constable Shyam Sonawane who was on duty guarding Baba Siddique when he was shot dad. Sonawane, from the protection branch, failed to respond when bullets were fired at Siddique.Sonawane told cops that the accused used pepper spray and burst crackers and hence, he became confused. “He said he could not see due to the smoke, which hindered him from taking defensive action,” said a cop.","Mumbai crime branch arrested five suspected members of the Maharashtra module of Lawrence Bishnoi’s gang allegedly involved in the killing of NCP politician Baba Siddique.

More job cuts coming

Intel has begun implementing mass layoffs that it announced back in August, impacting more than 2,000 jobs across several US states. The company says these workforce reductions are part of its broader cost-cutting measures.According to multiple reports, the job cuts will affect approximately 1,300 employees in Oregon , 385 in Arizona, 319 in California, and 251 in Texas.The impact is particularly significant in Oregon, where Intel is the second-largest private employer with over 20,000 workers. The affected employees in Oregon are based at facilities in Aloha and Hillsboro.The job cuts are set to begin on November 15, with employees receiving either a 60-day notice or a four-week notice with additional pay and benefits.These layoffs are part of Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger 's plan, announced in August, to eliminate over 15,000 jobs globally and reduce costs by more than $10 billion. The company aims to streamline operations in response to worsening financial conditions and increased competition in the semiconductor industry. So, more job cuts across more regions are expected.An Intel spokesperson confirmed that these job cuts are necessary steps to create ""a leaner, simpler, and more agile company"" positioned for long-term sustainable growth.The layoffs come alongside other strategic changes, including delays in opening new facilities outside the United States and restructuring its contract chip manufacturing business.","More than 2,000 employees in Oregon, Arizona, California, and Texas will lose their jobs.

While he died of a cardiac arrest in the hospital, doctors managed to save the girl.The tale of these two lovers has become a talking point in east Delhi's Jagatpuri . Intrigued enough, the cops have initiated an inquest even as the girl is yet to give a formal statement.Police interviewed the friends and family to establish the sequence of events. Arjun, 23, lived in Chand Park with his family and met a woman online around a year ago. The two started going on dates and over time fell in love with each other.However, the two quarrelled regularly over a range of issues, the cops were told. The woman was studying law and was serious about a career. Arjun was apparently not so serious about finding a job and also irked the girl with his frequent partying.Around 10 pm on Friday, the two had another fight. The woman had got into an argument with Arjun's relative over their relationship. Feeling insulted, she went home around 11.30pm and slit her wrist. She filmed the act and sent the video to Arjun on WhatsApp.Shocked and shaken after seeing the video, Arjun first informed the woman's mother, asking her to stop her daughter from ending her life. Arjun then reached the girl's house and rushed her toGuru Teg Bahadur Hospital around 2.45am.The couple had barely made it to the hospital, and Arjun had begun explaining to a nurse what had happened when he looked at his bleeding girlfriend one last time and collapsed.The doctors began efforts to resuscitate Arjun. Simultaneously, they started the woman's treatment. They managed to stop the bleeding from the cut, but not save Arjun. ""Save her... she will die..."" were his last words to his friend who had landed at the hospital on an SOS call.Police informed the families of both the youngsters, who have recorded their statements. Arjun's body was handed over to them after the autopsy on Saturday. The girl is recuperating and will survive, doctors said. She has been given counselling.","A young girl attempted to end her life and even filmed the act and sent it to the boy she loved.

Chidambaram, KPCC take on TN governor

Spirituality & politics don’t mix in TN: Deputy CM

Guv quotes from Sangam-era work

MK Gandhi had stressed on the importance of teaching students in vernacular languages, he said, and advised students to learn other Indian languages and foreign languages as well.During the convocation, degrees were conferred upon 656 candidates. Security was ramped up ahead of the governor’s visit to Thanjavur to attend the convocation and launch vision 2035 of Sastra deemed university. Central region police deployed around 500 police personnel and officers in Thanjavur. Minister for Tamil development and Tamil University pro-chancellor M P Saminathan did not make it to the event despite being mentioned in the invitation. Tamil University vice-chancellor V Thiruvalluvan was present.HR&CE minister P K Sekarbabu on Saturday criticised governor R N Ravi, accusing him of “creating unwanted controversies only ato attract media attention”. Law minister S Regupathy too lashed out at the governor, saying the word ‘Dravidian’ must be leaving a ‘bitter taste’ in his mouth.Sekarbabu told reporters in Chennai, “Governor is stirring unwanted controversies on a daily basis only to attract media attention. Whatever be the controversy he stirs, our chief minister M KStalin will give the right response and will never back off.”At the valedictory function of ‘Hindi Week’ celebrated by Doordarshan-Tamil in Chennai on Friday, the governor said only in Tamil Nadu is the two-language policy followed, the remaining 27 states opted for the three-language policy. But what triggered a furore was the omission of the word ‘Dravida’ from the ‘Tamil Thai Vaazhthu’ sung at the event. Stalin and several leaders, allies and opposition, strongly condemning it.Reacting to the controversy, Regupathy said ‘Dravidian’ must be a ‘bitter word’ for the governor. He told reporters in Pudukkottai, “We (DMK) are not divisive.”The DMK legal wing also condemned the governor. The legal wing, at its meeting held at Anna Arivalayam, the DMK headquarters, passed a resolution againstthe governor, accusing him of “acting as an agent of the BJP-led Union govt to destroy the Tamil language and Dravidian culture”.Stoutly rejecting TN governor R N Ravi’s claims that all states follow three language policy barring Tamil Nadu, former Union minister P Chidambaram on Saturday said many north Indian states primarily teach Hindi and follow a one-language policy.Taking to X, Chidambaram said many Hindi speaking states do not teach English and don’t have trained language teachers to conduct the classes. “He (governor) is living in an imaginary world,” he added.He also said there is no hindrance to learn Hindi in Tamil Nadu as thousands of students from the state were writing exams through Dakshina Bharat Hindi Prachar Sabha. “I request the governor to discuss govt policy based on facts,” he said.Meanwhile, Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee on Saturday questioned the governor’s proficiency in South Indian languages despite his long stint here. He said that Tamils face no difficulty in coming to Kerala and communicating and vice versa. KPCC questioned whether northern states include languages such as Malayalam, Tamil, Kannada, Telugu, Odia, and Bengali in their school curriculums.Deputy chief minister Udhayanidhi Stalin on Sunday said politics and spirituality do not go together in Tamil Nadu. Responding to former Telangana governor Tamilisai Soundararajan, Udhayanidhi said on X, ‘No matter what you say, politics and spirituality don’t go together in Tamil Nadu.”The deputy CM said people of Tamil Nadu were “closely watching her hailing Hindi and ditching Tamil, like the way the Union govt changed the name of the channel ‘Podhigai’ to DD Tamil”.Earlier, Tamilisai Soundararajan told reporters in Coimbatore that chief minister M K Stalin was attempting to create an illusion that BJP and Union govt were indifferent towards Tamil language. He sent a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, urging him to avoid “Hindi-language events in non-Hindispeaking states to push this narrative”.Tamilisai also took a dig at Udhayanidhi, saying that the deputy CM has begun doing ‘girivalam’ at Thiruvannamalai temple “to correct his mistakes” after speaking about ‘ Sanatana Dharma ’.Udhayanidhi responded, saying he went to Tiruvannamalai only to check if all the facilities were available for devotees who undertake ‘girivalam’.A day after finding himself in a controversy over omission of the words ‘Dravida Nal Thirunaadu’ from the lyrics of Tamil Thai Vaazhthu at a Doordarshan function he attended, governor R N Ravi on Saturday invoked Sangam-era literary work Purananooru, calling India a whole family, in Thanjavur.“India must grow forward with its values; it should have both internal and external growth ... so that we live together as a family. That’s what we call ‘ Vasudaiva kudumbakam’ and we have our own saying (Yaathum oore yavarum kelir) meaning ‘we are one family’,” he said at Sastra deemed university to launch ‘Sastra Vision 2035’ institution development plan and inaugurate ‘Anusandhan kendra’ III & IV, a 2.25 lakh sq ft research and innovation facility constructed at 60 crore. Sastra chancellor R Sethuraman, vice-chancellor S Vaidhyasubramaniam and director & CFO of Kaynes technology Jairam P Sampath were present.On the occasion, the national anthem and Tamil Thai Vaazhthu were sung in their entirety. In his address, Ravi said, “We started to build a new country after Independence forgetting the past and its inherent strength. But now we have a leader who looks at this country not in segments, compartments and not in terms of divisions but as a family.”Complimenting Sastra on its growth, he urged the students to be a part of VIKSIT BHARAT @ 2047. Sastra also exchanged an MoU with Kaynes Semicon in the presence of the governor to establish a centre of excellence in semiconductor manufacturing.","The 14th convocation of Tamil University in Thanjavur commenced with the recital of the national anthem followed by Tamil Thaai Vaazhthu by three people from the university.

Cuba gets some electricity back after major power outage left millions in the dark,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/cuba-gets-some-electricity-back-after-major-power-outage-left-millions-in-the-dark/articleshow/114381072.cms,"People mill about on the Malecon during a massive blackout after a major power plant failed in Havana (AP photo)

HAVANA : Cuba 's government on Saturday said that some electricity was restored on the island after one of the country's major power plants failed and left millions without electricity for two days.Energy Minister Vicente de la O Levy said the country had 500 megawatts in its electrical grid early Saturday, as compared to 3 gigawatts that are normally generated.He posted on X that ""several substations in the west now have electricity.""O Levy also said two thermoelectric power plants are back and two more will resume their operations ""in the next few hours.""About half of Cuba was plunged into darkness on Thursday evening, followed by the entire island on Friday morning after one of the plants failed.Havana's electricity company said in a statement earlier on Saturday that a part of its western system was disconnected ""after the exit of one of the plants that was delivering service."" That issue has left some parts of the city in the dark once again.The streets of Cuba's capital, where 2 million people live, were quiet on Saturday, with few cars driving by after a night that was lit by candles and lamps. The impact of the blackout goes beyond lighting, and services like water supply also depend on electricity to run pumps.This is considered to be Cuba's worst blackout in two years, after a category 3 hurricane damaged power installations and it took days for the government to fix them. This year the electricity service worsened, with several homes in the dark for hours every day.In addition to the Antonio Guiteras plant, whose failure on Friday affected the entire national system, Cuba has several others and it wasn't immediately clear whether or not they remained functional.There is no official estimate for when the blackout will end. Even in a country that is used to outages as part of a deepening economic crisis, Friday's supply collapse was massive.The Cuban government has announced emergency measures to slash electricity demand, including suspending classes, shutting down some state-owned workplaces and canceling nonessential services. Officials said that 1.64 gigawatts went offline during peak hours, about half the total demand at the time.Local authorities said the outage, which started in a smaller scale on Thursday, stemmed from increased demand from small and medium-sized companies and residences' air conditioners. Later, the blackout got worse due to breakdowns in old thermoelectric plants that haven't been properly maintained and the lack of fuel to operate some facilities.Changes to electricity rates for small- and medium-sized companies, which have proliferated since they were first authorized by the communist government in 2021, are also being considered.","Energy Minister Vicente de la O Levy said the country had 500 megawatts in its electrical grid early Saturday, as compared to 3 gigawatts that are normally generated.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. A greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/exemptions is the need of the hour.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

When can we expect the

Robotaxi Network

?

Just when it seemed like Elon Musk had achieved the impossible after his SpaceX caught a booster rocket, we now have the a fully self-driving cab without a driver, a pedal, a steering wheel, or any other sort of manual intervention. Tesla’s much-anticipated Cybercab was unveiled in California, offering a preview of what could be the future of urban transport .The event, held at Warner Bros. Discovery studios, featured the self-driving vehicle navigating an artificial city environment, specially designed for the showcase. Although the Cybercab is not yet ready for public roads, its reveal sparked excitement and raised questions about the future of autonomous technology .The Cybercab’s design immediately stands out, with its sleek, pod-like shape and futuristic butterfly doors that open upward. The interior, completely devoid of traditional controls like a steering wheel or pedals, feels like something straight out of a science fiction film. Its spacious, minimalist cabin is controlled through a touchscreen interface, further enhancing its futuristic appeal.Despite its sci-fi aesthetic, there are practical concerns about how the vehicle will handle the unpredictability of real-world driving. In the controlled environment of the studio, the Cybercab moved effortlessly, gliding through streets that mimicked a real city.However, it’s unclear how well the vehicle would perform in a more chaotic setting with unexpected obstacles such as pedestrians or cyclists.During the demonstration, the Cybercab did show signs of situational awareness , stopping instantly when someone stepped into its path, indicating that it can detect and respond to its surroundings. This suggests that Tesla has made significant progress toward achieving full autonomy, though there is still a long way to go before such vehicles are ready for widespread use.While the potential benefits of autonomous vehicles are clear, including reduced human error and greater accessibility for those unable to drive, concerns remain. Questions about how these vehicles will handle complex, split-second decisions in real-world scenarios persist. Additionally, the ethical and safety implications of allowing machines to take full control of the driving process are still being debated.Tesla’s Cybercab represents a bold step towards the future of transportation. While it offers a glimpse of what might be possible, there are still many challenges—both technical and societal—that must be addressed before fully autonomous vehicles become a part of everyday life. For now, the Cybercab serves as a compelling vision of a future where mobility is redefined, but its role in that future remains to be determined.Tasha Keeney, ARK Invest ’s Director of Investment Analysis & Institutional Strategies, has suggested that Tesla’s Robotaxi Network could launch as early as 2025 or 2026. Keeney believes that Tesla might not need to wait for the Cybercab to roll out its Robotaxi Network.Both Keeney and Cathie Wood, ARK Invest’s CEO, attended Tesla’s “We, Robot” event on 10th October, where they waited to ride in the newly revealed Tesla Cybercab , which is intended to be central to the Robotaxi Network.However, Keeney and her colleagues at ARK Invest are of the view that Tesla could launch the network without the Cybercab. She argued that Tesla already possesses a fleet of vehicles equipped with Hardware 3 and 4, which could achieve full autonomy via over-the-air software updates.Even if Tesla opts to wait until the Cybercab is ready for fully autonomous rides, ARK Invest has suggested that the company could still introduce the Robotaxi Network using human drivers. In 2020, ARK Invest released an article explaining why it would be advantageous for Tesla to launch the network with human drivers first.ARK argued that a ride-hailing network would boost Tesla’s profitability before the robotaxi service becomes operational. Furthermore, they suggested that launching the robotaxi service would not require significant engineering resources, aside from crucial tasks such as routing, payment integration, and other necessary functions.ARK also noted that a vertically integrated ride-hailing service using highly efficient electric vehicles would increase the proportion of miles driven on electric platforms, furthering","Tesla’s much-anticipated Cybercab was unveiled in California, offering a preview of what could be the future of urban transport.

A Conversation with Mia Khalifa

Mia Khalifa 's journey from adult film star to social media influencer has been marked by controversy and resilience. In a recent interview with The New York Times , she discussed her experiences in the adult industry, the ongoing Israel-Lebanon conflict, and the impact of growing up in a post-9/11 America .Khalifa's entry into the adult film industry at the age of 21 quickly made her infamous, particularly after a scene in which she wore a hijab went viral.This video led to severe backlash, including death threats and harassment. Reflecting on this tumultuous period, she stated, “I became infamous by accident.” The intensity of the reaction forced her to leave the adult industry, as she realised she could not return to a normal life. “I decided to try to be an influencer and a public person if that was the fate that I had sealed for myself,” she explained.Now boasting millions of followers across platforms like X, Instagram, and TikTok, Khalifa has shifted her focus from adult content to lifestyle and political commentary. She described her current brand as one of evolution, saying, “Where I am now mentally, emotionally, on every level, is a complete 180 from who I was.” While she engages her TikTok audience with light-hearted videos, she uses X to advocate for various social issues. Despite the adult content associated with her work onOnlyFans , Khalifa emphasises authenticity, stating, “Just because I look a certain way in a bikini does not necessarily mean it’s not for the girls.”In discussing her experience on OnlyFans, Khalifa acknowledged the complexities of sex work. “It is [sex work], and I feel like people who get insulted by that feel ashamed of being lumped in with sex workers,” she said. Despite this, she views her participation as one of agency and control, insisting that it should not be seen as a solution to financial desperation. Khalifa stressed her responsibility to represent the platform carefully, stating, “I have a responsibility to not promote it as something that any woman should join unless they’ve already been in the sex-work industry.”Khalifa also opened up about her struggles with internalized misogyny, which she attributes to cultural pressures. Growing up in Washington, DC, in a post-9/11 world exposed her to blatant racism, leading her to question her identity. “I grew up in DC in a post-9/11 world, and there was a lot of blatant racism,” she recalled, reflecting on how this experience forced her to conform to societal expectations.Amid ongoing violence in the Israel-Lebanon conflict, Khalifa has remained actively engaged in discussions about the humanitarian crisis. With friends and family in Lebanon, she expressed concern for their safety and said, “They’re able to open their doors and give them a place to stay.” Her activism extends to social media, where she addresses critical issues such as human rights and the importance of speaking out on political matters. “It’s not taboo to have an opinion,” she asserted, arguing that influencers should participate in political discourse rather than shy away from it.","Mia Khalifa is a social media influencer and former adult film star.
