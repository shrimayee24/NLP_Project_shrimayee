‘Don’t lower the age. Just stop jailing adolescent love’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dont-lower-the-age-just-stop-jailing-adolescent-love/articleshow/122915762.cms,"With the Supreme Court weighing in, a growing chorus of experts is calling for decriminalising consensual relationships even if the age of consent is not lowered

New Delhi :

TOI

With the Supreme Court hearing a pivotal case over whether to lower the statutory age of consent for sexual activity from 18 to 16 years, activists and experts working with children or dealing with cases that fall in the domain of “consensual romantic relationships” bring into focus the various complexities and challenges the situation presents in courts and beyond for “adolescents”.At one end is a strong view that highlights the plight of boys and girls caught in such cases — putting their dignity, liberty and right to protection as teenagers at stake. On the other end are activists, who caution that attempts to change the age of consent could present a situation that could lead to misuse and enable child marriage in the garb of “romantic relationships”.In the case before SC, for instance, senior advocate and amicus curiae Indira Jaising has urged the court to read down the current legal threshold of 18, arguing that the existing provisions criminalise consensual adolescent relationships and infringe on constitutional rights.On the other hand, the Union govt has insisted that the age must remain 18 to safeguard minors from exploitation, warning that bringing down the age could undermine the country’s child protection framework.An attempt to address the complexities was also made by the Law Commission in its report on the issue in 2023. It had advised against lowering the age of consent from 18 years. It also suggested amendments in the Pocso Act to introduce guided judicial discretion by the special court in the matter of deciding on sentencing in cases involving “tacit approval” of minors between 16 and 18 years old.Swagata Raha, the founder of Enfold, a child rights NGO, has repeated her demand to decriminalise sexual relationships deemed “consensual” — by creating an exception in Pocso for those aged between 16 and 18. “We are not saying that the age of consent needs to be brought down to 16,” she told. “The current provision under Pocso, which sets the age of consent at 18, presents a situation where a romantic consensual relationship between adolescents is treated as a criminal act, on a par with sexual exploitation and rape. This is clearly damaging, and has long-term impact on the life and dignity of young people. To restore balance in law, this needs to change through the introduction of exceptions recognising consent of those above 16 years. ” At least one in four cases criminalised under Pocso is “romantic” in nature, she said, citing empirical studies based on judgments.On the other hand, Bhuwan Ribhu, founder of Just Rights for Children, warned that lowering consent will open a Pandora’s box, legitimising various forms of child rape as well as trafficking and child marriage. “The law is being misunderstood and misinterpreted in the so-called consent debate,” he said, adding, “No amendment to Pocso should be made until the current law is implemented in letter and spirit. With less than 10% conviction rate and compensation awarded in fewer than 1% of cases, the need of the hour is to implement the law before we amend it. ”Ribhu suggested that in “genuine cases” of romantic consensual relationships, with appropriate checks and balances, it was possible to ensure protection without tinkering with consent. He felt Pocso could be amended to decriminalise situations, say, where there is a history of a romantic relationship between a boy and a girl and where the latter has been consistent in her statements before child protection agencies and courts, and where there is no gang rape or prior criminal history.However, child justice and criminal lawyer Anant Asthana feels that the issue can be addressed through amendments to Pocso — to create room for judges to exercise discretion with necessary checks to protect genuine cases of romantic relationships. Drawing attention to the lack of child-friendly policing, he highlighted the need to first equip police with a protocol to deal with such cases to protect the identity of the boy and girl.Advocate and founder of Independent Thought, Vikram Srivastava, said any attempt to alter the age of consent would open the doors to misuse and increase the risk of child marriage in the garb of consent, by the parents themselves, as seen in many states. “Among socalled consensual relationships, in most cases we find they are entangled in a series of illegalities leading to elopement. Even for ‘genuine consensual relationships’, checks and procedural safeguards must be provided to filter genuine cases,” he said.Putting across the perspective of adolescents affected by such cases, Sonal Kapoor from Protsahan, which works with child survivors of abuse, said that blanket criminalisation of consensual adolescent relationships under Pocso, even when non-exploitative and rooted in mutual consent, stripped young people of voice, choice and agency.“Lowering the age of consent risks weakening protections against coercion. But keeping it rigid results in young couples being dragged through criminal trials, humiliated and dehumanised by the same laws that are meant to protect them,” she said. “The law must evolve. It must hold space for both protection of children and autonomy of young people.”",The Supreme Court is hearing a case over whether to lower the statutory age of consent for sexual activity from 18 to 16 years. Activists and experts working with children or dealing with cases that fall in the domain of “consensual romantic relationships’ are calling for decriminalising consensual relationships even if the age is not lowered.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122915742,imgsize-161204,width-400,resizemode-4/122915742.jpg"

'Wrong Bodies' Of Ahmedabad Air India Crash Victims Sent to Families: India Dismisses UK Media Claim

NEW DELHI: Brainstorming is on at the highest levels of Tata Group and the aviation ministry to put Air India back on track after the spate of bad news led by the deadly AI 171 crash and regulatory actions in past few months. Tata Sons chairman N Chandrasekaran on Friday met Union aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu and aviation secretary Samir Kumar Sinha. The meeting came after three days of detailed discussions between the airline management led by CEO Campbell Wilson and officials led by the secretary that have led to concrete suggestions emerging from the same.“We have discussed all issues threadbare including those related to maintenance, leadership and communications. Something positive will come out of this. India needs strong carriers and govt will support airlines wherever needed. The results will hopefully be visible in coming days once the suggestions are implemented,” said people in the know. One such meeting went on till well after 10 pm earlier this week.Sources say Chandrasekaran informed govt about the steps being taken by the airline post AI 171 crash and some recent incidents o bolster safety.“Basically, it was informed how AI plans to win back flyers’ confidence,” they said.It is learnt the areas identified during the recent meetings for immediate attention include airworthiness, engineering and maintenance. A lack of spares, for instance, often forces aircraft to fly under “minimum equipment list” (MEL) for a long time. MEL is a list that conditionally allows aircraft to be used with some equipment inoperative with the condition that the same does not impact safety and that it would be replaced within a certain timeframe.The main issue, say multiple people involved in the exercise, is of culture. “Vistara was merged into AI last Nov, ideally it should have been the other way round. But that is done. Both the airlines have a very different culture and AI is now facing post-merger issues. During the meetings, solutions were suggested. The main issue is not operations but it is about engineering and maintenance,” they said.For some time, having the better run Singapore Airlines (SIA) — which has 25.1% stake in AI with the rest with the Tatas — play a more visible handholding may be considered. It’s not about the image of AI alone, which has taken a beating, but also the Maharaja’s new promoters — Tatas and SIA.The focus has to be on ensuring 100% safety and not growing rapidly. AI has cut flights post the Ahmedabad crash. “The culture has to change to safety first not just for AI but all airlines. Sacrifice growth but ensure safety. That has to be the firm message across the board,” they said.The example being cited is of Boeing which has been through a rollercoaster in recent years from being a “marvellous organisation once celebrated for engineering excellence” to an airline cutting corners for commercial reasons when it tried to counter competitor Airbus’ best-seller A320NEO planes with a hurriedly made B737 MAX. After two MAX crashes in quick succession, Boeing is now trying hard to win back customer airlines’ and flyers’ faith by making safer planes.",Tata Sons chairman N Chandrasekaran met Union aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu and aviation secretary Samir Kumar Sinha.

Centre suggests 'country of origin' filter on e-commerce sites,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/centre-suggests-country-of-origin-filter-on-e-commerce-sites/articleshow/122913751.cms,"Centre suggests 'country of origin' filter on e-commerce sites

New Delhi/Mumbai: Consumer affairs department on Friday suggested e-commerce companies explore including a new filter feature of ""country of origin"" on their websites and mobile apps for products, which will help consumers make quick choices. E-commerce platforms would have to create a new filter having a drop down menu of countries, allowing consumers to make their choice as per their preference.At present, companies display the country of origin of items under the product description option and to check this, buyers need to go through the entire information of each product, which is more time taking. ""Many of the e-commerce platforms have filters on their sites and apps such as price range, brand, type of product and different sizes. So, adding another filter on country of origin is very much feasible and that will help consumers to find items of their choice based on their country of origin quickly. This will bring customer satisfaction,"" said an official.The department held a video conference with industry players and other stakeholders on Friday for amending the Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules for country of origin-based filters on their platforms.""There was almost a consensus among the participants, including from major ecommerce firms, and they said this would need change in the algorithm to create this new filter feature. We will hold more deliberations with the stakeholders,"" said an official. Sources said earlier the e-commerce firms smoothly complied with the Legal Metrology Rules for labeling packaged commodities.Industry sources said the meeting was more of an exploratory one where the idea was to understand the feasibility of getting the added filter within apps and platforms. They added that officials wanted to understand the constraints of companies if they were to create such a feature. ""For marketplaces like Amazon, Flipkart and Myntra, it would be more of a tech related issue, which can be solved. But for companies which hold inventory, there may be an added compliance burden,"" one of them said.Another e-commerce executive, however, said that given the limited space on mobile phones, adding another filter could be a constraint. ""It could be quite draining for the industry. And the expectation of the ministry is to get it done before the festive season if it gets implemented,"" he said.Satish Meena, adviser at market research firm Datum Intelligence, said if this is implemented, customers will be able to filter out products based on their country of origin which means that some brands on these platforms could lose visibility. ""Until now, not many consumers paid so much attention to a product's country of origin. But overall, it shouldn't be a very big challenge for platforms,"" he added. For quick commerce platforms, food and grocery accounts for a major part of their coverage as of now and most of them are sourced from India anyway. A very small part of their inventory comes from out of India currently, added Meena.","Consumer affairs department suggests 'country of origin' filter on e-commerce sites.

All parties agree Varma ouster should be a joint call, says Rijiju

NEW DELHI: The Lok Sabha will take up an all-party motion to remove Justice Yashwant Varma of Allahabad HC over the cash-in-house controversy. The opposition-sponsored notice for a similar motion in the Rajya Sabha hasn't been admitted. RS secretariat, after a mandatory scrutiny, didn't find it to be in ""complete compliance with the procedure"", sources said.Former Vice-President Jagdeep Dhankhar's move to allow the notice is believed to have caused unhappiness within the government. Now that it has been clarified that it was not admitted, it clears the way for LS Speaker Om Birla to choose three members of the probe panel, comprising CJI or an SC judge, an HC chief justice and a jurist, to probe the allegations of corruption against Varma. The RS chairperson would've had an equal say in the matter if RS secretariat ruled otherwise.The decision about Lok Sabha taking up the matter, announced by parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju, was followed by 152 members drawn from all political parties signing the motion.The issue is said to be at the core of former RS chairman and ex-Veep Jagdeep Dhankhar's abrupt resignation on Monday. Dhankhar had accepted the motion signed by 63 opposition members against Justice Yashwant Varma despite the decision at all-party meeting on Sunday that process for the removal of the judge should begin in the LS.Dhankhar's action of accepting opposition's notice is said to have set in motion a chain of events, murmurs of a ""secret deal"" and, crucially, a move by BJP-led coalition to signal their loss of trust in the Chairman, leading to his surprise exist on ""health grounds"".Rijiju reiterated Friday that there was a unanimous decision of all political parties to move for the removal of Varma, asserting that the Lok Sabha will take up the motion.The minister said all political parties had agreed that the removal of Justice Varma should be a joint call, adding that the proceedings will be taken up in the Lok Sabha and then moved to the Rajya Sabha, in line with the Judges (Inquiry) Act. ""We shouldn't remain in any doubt; proceedings will begin in the Lok Sabha,"" he said.Section 3, sub-section (2) of the Act says, ""If notices of motions for removal of a Judge are given on the same day in both Houses of Parliament, no committee shall be constituted unless the motion has been admitted in both Houses, and where such motion has been admitted in both Houses, the committee shall be constituted jointly by the speaker and the chairman.""",The Lok Sabha will take up an all-party motion to remove Justice Yashwant Varma.

'Student suicides a systemic failure': SC issues directions on 'mental health crisis',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/student-suicides-a-systemic-failure-sc-issues-directions-on-mental-health-crisis/articleshow/122913205.cms,"To stop student suicides, SC asks states to notify coaching centre rules in 2 mths

NEW DELHI: Observing that the very soul of education stands distorted with students being forced into a rat race and subjected to relentless psychological pressure resulting in increasing number of suicide cases, Supreme Court directed all educational institutions, including coaching centres, to ensure mental health safeguards.The court passed a slew of directions to institutions, including appointing counsellors or psychologists, avoiding batch segregation based on academic performance and mandatorily training staff twice a year by certified mental health professionals.Lamenting the degradation of the education system to a high-stakes race with narrowly defined goals of achievement, status and economic security, a bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta said that a system has to put in place to protect the life of students who take the extreme step due to various reasons.""The joy of learning has been replaced by anxiety over rankings, results and relentless performance metrics. Students, especially those preparing for competitive examinations, are often caught in a web that rewards conformity over curiosity, output over understanding, and endurance over well-being,"" said Justice Mehta, who penned the judgement for the bench, emphasising that multi-sectoral approach towards suicide prevention with a specific focus on youth was needed.It said education is meant to liberate, not burden the learner, and that its true success lies not in grades or rankings but in the holistic growth of a human being capable of living with dignity, confidence and purpose.The court passed the order on a plea filed by parents of a medical aspirant who committed suicide and ordered a CBI probe in the case after noting loopholes in investigations done by Andhra Pradesh police.The apex court said continued loss of young lives due to unattended psychological distress, academic overburden and institutional insensitivity reflect a systemic failure that cannot be ignored.It directed states and UTs to notify rules within two months mandating registration, student protection norms, and grievance redressal mechanisms for all private coaching centres. As per NCRB, India recorded 1,70,924 reported suicide cases in 2022 of which 7.6%, approx 13,044, were student suicides. Notably, 2,248 of these deaths were attributed directly to failure in exams. As per NCRB data, the number of suicides among students in the last two decades has increased from 5,425 in 2001 to 13,044 in 2022.""In recent past, reports have emerged of student suicides in premier institutions and, particularly, coaching centres, pointing to a pattern of despair that demands collective introspection. These young individuals, often far away from home, isolated in demanding academic environments, find themselves without adequate emotional or institutional support. The culture of silence around mental health exacerbates their vulnerability. The gravity of this crisis cannot be overstated, and any incident involving the death of a student under such circumstances warrants the utmost seriousness, not just as an isolated tragedy but as part of a larger systemic malaise that threatens the future of the young generation,"" SC said.","Supreme Court orders all educational institutions, including coaching centres, to ensure mental health safeguards.

NEW DELHI: Early on Thursday, the ED swooped in on more than 35 premises identified with industrialist Anil Ambani and at least 50 entities associated with his Reliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group (ADAG) across Mumbai in a larger money laundering investigation targeted at him based on multiple FIRs registered by CBI and other agencies over the last few years. The searches have huge financial implications for public money, Rs 20-30,000 crore, which the agency believes has been siphoned off.The searches at premises identified with industrialist Anil Ambani have huge financial implications for public money, Rs 20-30,000 crore, which the agency believes has been siphoned off, including outside the country, through ""undisclosed foreign bank accounts and foreign assets"" created over the years. A large chunk of the money came to Reliance ADAG from SBI and other public sector banks, besides Yes Bank, then a private entity, and mutual funds.Preliminary investigation has thrown up a mysterious entity: 'C Company'. The entity, whose existence was not known so far, is allegedly found to have been involved in related party transactions in this whole scam, sources said.Sources said ED was probing an alleged loan fraud ofRs 14,000 crore involving Reliance Communications Ltd and other associated entities. In response to a question in Lok Sabha on Monday, minister of state for finance Pankaj Chaudhary said SBI has ""classified Reliance Communications Ltd along with promoter director Anil Ambani as 'fraud' on June 13"".This has also been communicated to Bombay Stock Exchange.""Based on information received from Sebi, ED has found Reliance Infra has diverted large sums of money disguised as ICDs to group companies of ADAG (Anil Ambani group) through 'C Company', an undisclosed related company,"" a source told TOI.Reliance Infra did not disclose 'C Company' as its related party in order to avoid having to take proper approval from shareholder and audit committees, the source added. It was also hidden presumably to circumvent checks and balances imposed on related party transactions as per laws.Besides, there is an investigation in the alleged diversion of loans of over Rs 10,000 crore by Reliance Infra. ED's probe is looking at why Reliance Infra took a haircut of Rs 5,480 crore, receiving only Rs 4 crore in cash, while agreeing to settle the remaining Rs 6,499 crore through transfer to certain discoms, which have neither been operational nor done business for many years.The agency is already probing Ambani and his entities in a case of Rs 3,000 crore received from Yes Bank where he is alleged to have bribed the former CEO of the bank, Rana Kapoor, through his wife's company for Rs 225 crore. In another case of alleged misappropriation of bank funds, the agency is probing Reliance Communications for a loan default ofRs 1,050 crore to Canara Bank.Sources said more than 25 individuals, including Ambani and his close associates, are targets of the search operations which started on Thursday morning in a probe initiated under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.ED is being assisted by multiple agencies, including National Housing Bank, Sebi, National Financial Reporting Authority and Bank of Baroda among others.The alleged loan diversion of around Rs 3,000 crore from Yes Bank pertains to the period between 2017 and 2019. ED is investigating alleged quid pro quo in sanction of loan as a Reliance Anil Ambani entity had transferredRs 225 crore into the accounts of RAB Enterprises, in which Rana Kapoor's wife Bindu Kapoor had 100% stake.These are all part of an FIR registered by CBI and now being investigated by ED. The FIR also alleged that credit approval memorandums were back dated, and the proposed investments lacked due diligence, not meeting the bank's credit policy.Sources said preliminary investigation found that these loans were diverted to many group entities and shell companies, in many cases there was no proper documentation to loans issued. In several cases, borrowers were found to have common addresses and directors.","The ED swooped in on more than 35 premises identified with industrialist Anil Ambani and at least 50 entities associated with his Reliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group (ADAG) across Mumbai.

NEW DELHI: A case has been registered against a group of individuals accused of attempting to extort Rs 25 lakh from the popular Rameshwaram Cafe by allegedly staging a false incident of food contamination at its Kempegowda International Airport outlet in Bengaluru.According to police, the incident took place on the morning of 24 July.According to news agency PTI, a group of five to seven people reportedly caused a public disturbance by claiming that an insect had been found in the food served at the cafe.The complaint, filed by the café’s operations head, alleges that the individuals threatened to release a video of the incident on social media unless they were compensated.Soon after the scene, the team reportedly received a phone call demanding Rs 25 lakh in cash to avoid reputational damage to the brand.The cafe management has submitted call records, message screenshots, and other documents to support their claims and has urged police to take swift legal action.Police say a Zero FIR has been registered under sections 308(2) and 351(4) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), and the case will be transferred to the jurisdiction relevant to the complainant’s address.A Zero FIR allows a complaint to be filed at any police station regardless of the location of the crime.In a statement, Divya Raghav, founder of The Rameshwaram Café, rejected the accusations.“We categorically deny the baseless accusation that a worm or insect was found in our food,” she said. “This is clearly a staged act with malicious intent to extort money and malign our brand.”Ms Raghav said the cafe operates under “the strictest quality protocols” and that food safety, especially at sensitive locations like airports, is non-negotiable.She added that similar extortion attempts had been made in the past.“We will not succumb to intimidation or blackmail,” she said, adding that the company is fully cooperating with authorities and plans to pursue legal action against the alleged perpetrators.","A case has been registered against a group of individuals accused of attempting to extort Rs 25 lakh from the popular Rameshwaram Cafe.

"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says: 'If I were 20 years old today, I would focus more on this field than software'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-says-if-i-were-20-years-old-today-i-would-focus-more-on-this-field-than-software/articleshow/122776861.cms,"Jensen Huang's evolving view: from engineering to physical AI

The rise of physical AI and the future of robotics

During a recent visit to Beijing, Nvidia co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang was asked what he would study if he were a 20-year-old graduate in 2025. His answer was clear: he’d choose a different academic direction than the one that launched his own career. Though he didn’t explicitly name a single subject, Huang emphasized that he would lean more toward the physical sciences rather than software. This subtle but significant shift points to his evolving view of where the next wave of opportunity lies. His response reflects a broader vision for the future of artificial intelligence—one rooted not just in code, but in physics, robotics , and the mechanics of the real world that AI must increasingly learn to navigate and reason through.Jensen Huang, who earned his electrical engineering degree from Oregon State University and a master’s from Stanford, co-founded Nvidia in 1993. Today, the company sits at the forefront of the AI revolution and recently hit a historic $4 trillion market cap. While reflecting on his own path, Huang revealed he had graduated from college at age 20 and, if given the chance again, would pursue physical sciences, fields that deal with non-living systems like physics, chemistry, and astronomy.Although he didn’t go into specifics about why, Huang’s broader remarks provide insight. Over the years, AI has evolved from “Perception AI,” which focused on recognition tasks like image detection, to “Generative AI,” which includes language models capable of translating, coding, and creating. But the next chapter, according to Huang, is “Reasoning AI,” systems that can understand context, solve novel problems, and act as “agentic AI” or digital robots with reasoning power.Huang’s vision aligns with growing industry momentum around embodied AI—where intelligence is tied to physical systems like robots or autonomous machines. Leading research labs such as DeepMind and Boston Dynamics are already exploring this frontier, integrating reinforcement learning with robotics to train systems capable of real-world interaction and problem-solving. This convergence of AI with physics and motion is what Huang sees as the next great leap.Huang’s remarks hint at a future where AI is not just software-driven but deeply embedded in the physical world. This shift could redefine education paths for aspiring technologists, with physics and engineering regaining center stage. It’s no longer just about writing better code; it’s about building machines that think, move, and adapt. And for Huang, the future of AI might look less like a screen and more like a robot with a brain.Looking ahead, Huang predicts the rise of “Physical AI,” where artificial intelligence must grasp real-world physics: friction, inertia, cause and effect. These capabilities go beyond generating text or images—they involve anticipating how objects move, how to grip items with the right force, or how to infer the presence of hidden obstacles like a pedestrian behind a car.When AI gains this kind of physical reasoning and is embedded into machines, it leads to robotics, a critical component of Huang’s vision. With global labor shortages and the rapid expansion of manufacturing facilities, especially across the United States, Huang sees robotics powered by physical AI as essential. “Hopefully, in the next 10 years... they’re highly robotic and helping us deal with the severe labor shortage,” he said, underscoring the need for innovation that bridges the digital and physical worlds.","Jensen Huang predicts the rise of “Physical AI,” where artificial intelligence must grasp real-world physics.

AI-powered growth and record investments

From modest beginnings to Silicon Valley’s summit

After a decade at the helm of Alphabet, Sundar Pichai has officially joined the ranks of billionaires, marking a rare achievement for a non-founding tech CEO. Pichai, who took over as CEO of Google in 2015 and became Alphabet’s chief in 2019, now holds a net worth of $1.1 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The milestone comes after Alphabet’s market value soared by over $1 trillion since early 2023, delivering 120% returns to investors. Pichai’s rise has been defined by his leadership through multiple technological shifts, from mobile and cloud computing to AI. As Alphabet’s shares hit record highs, his decade-long stewardship has culminated in both financial success and strategic transformation.While tech billionaires are often company founders, Pichai’s entry into the billionaire club is different. He holds just 0.02% of Alphabet’s economic stake, currently valued at around $440 million. Most of his net worth comes from share sales and performance-based compensation over the past ten years. Bloomberg reports that he has sold over $650 million in stock during his tenure. If he had retained all his shares, they would now be worth more than $2.5 billion. Despite the modest stake, Pichai’s long-term vision and steady leadership have driven massive growth in Alphabet’s core businesses.August 2025 marks ten years since Pichai became CEO of Google. In that time, Alphabet has expanded rapidly, turning once-nascent divisions like YouTube, Cloud, Play, and Subscriptions into billion-dollar engines. In a recent post on X, Pichai highlighted that in 2015, Alphabet’s total revenue was $75 billion, whereas YouTube and Google Cloud alone are now generating an annual run rate of $110 billion. Under his leadership, Alphabet restructured into a parent holding company, sharpened its AI focus, and increased its global footprint.A major factor in Alphabet’s recent trillion-dollar surge has been its aggressive AI investments . The company spent $50 billion in 2023 alone on infrastructure, semiconductors, and data centers to support its AI ambitions. It also raised its 2025 capital expenditure forecast by $10 billion, reaching $85 billion, most of which is earmarked for AI infrastructure. “Our AI infrastructure investments are crucial to meeting the growth in demand for cloud customers,” Pichai said during the Q2 earnings call. Alphabet’s DeepMind acquisition in 2014 for $400 million has also paid off, helping the company stay ahead in the AI race.Born in Tamil Nadu, India, Sundar Pichai’s journey to Silicon Valley is one of resilience and brilliance. He grew up in a two-room apartment, with his first telephone arriving when he was 12. A scholarship brought him to Stanford in 1993, with a one-way plane ticket that reportedly cost more than his father’s annual salary. Pichai joined Google in 2004, led the development of Chrome, and later oversaw Android, before rising to the top job.Sundar Pichai is also known for his calm, consensus-driven leadership style, which has earned him respect in an industry often defined by bold personalities. In recent years, he has become increasingly vocal on topics like AI regulation, digital privacy, and ethical tech, positioning Alphabet as a global thought leader beyond just innovation.Outside of tech, Pichai has also ventured into sports. He is reportedly part of a group of executives that acquired a 49% stake in the London Spirit cricket team for $182 million. The team competes in The Hundred, a professional cricket league launched in the UK in 2020. While his wealth may not rival that of Alphabet founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, worth $171.2 billion and $160.4 billion respectively, Pichai's path to the billionaire club is proof that transformational leadership, even without a founding stake, can build both companies and fortunes.",Sundar Pichai is the first non-founder CEO to become a billionaire.

Asset managers navigate data security challenges

BlackRock , the world's largest asset manager, has imposed new restrictions on company-issued devices for employees traveling to China, requiring staff to use temporary loaner phones and prohibiting company laptops during business trips, according to Bloomberg News and Reuters reports.The financial giant detailed the ""policy enhancement"" in an internal memo effective July 16, barring the use of BlackRock-issued iPhones, iPads, laptops, and remote access via virtual private networks while in China. Employees will also lose access to the BlackRock network during personal travel to the country, Bloomberg reported.The move reflects mounting corporate anxiety about business operations in China as geopolitical tensions between Washington and Beijing continue to strain international business relationships. BlackRock did not immediately respond to requests for comment from either Reuters or Bloomberg.The restrictions come after a series of high-profile incidents involving Western business executives being prevented from leaving China. Wells Fargo suspended travel to China last week after one of its senior trade financing bankers, Chenyue Mao, was blocked from departing the country in what Beijing's foreign ministry described as a criminal matter.Earlier this month, China also prevented a US Patent and Trademark Office employee from leaving during a personal visit, while a US Commerce Department worker has reportedly been unable to leave China for several months.Since China implemented stricter data security laws in 2021, global financial firms have struggled to balance operational needs with compliance requirements. Many banks and asset managers have established onshore data centers to keep Chinese information within the country, adding significant costs and complicating business management.BlackRock maintains a substantial presence in China through a wholly owned mutual fund company and a wealth management joint venture with China Construction Bank Corp. The firm's new travel policy reflects the broader challenges facing global financial institutions operating in an increasingly complex regulatory and security environment between the world's two largest economies.In related news, Amazon is shutting down its AI lab in Shanghai amid rising geopolitical tensions between the US and China.

CHANDIGARH: Declining bail to a Punjab Police constable, widely known as the ‘Instagram queen,’ in a corruption case, the Punjab and Haryana high court has observed that the allegations against herare grave and attract serious concern, particularly in light of the position of public trust held by a serving police official.The HC was also of the view that the nature of the allegations, the magnitude of the disproportion, the possibility of further recovery and scrutiny, and the involvement of the petitioner in other criminal cases necessitate a thorough investigation that would be hampered if she was released on bail at this stage.Justice Manjari NehruKaul, in her order released Friday, dismissed the bail petition of Amandeep Kaur, also dubbed the ‘Thar wali constable’ due to her lavish lifestyle. Kaur has already been dismissed from the Punjab Police.The HC observed, “Thematerial placed before this court, including the financial analysis chart submitted with the FIR, reveals a substantial and prima facie unjustified increase in wealth during the check period.”The court found the defence’s arguments regarding anarbitrary check period unpersuasive, particularly in light of overall financial inflows and Kaur’s alleged involvement in two other criminal cases, including one under the NDPS Act.Justice Kaul further noted that explanations offeredby Kaur’s counsel regarding alternative income sources, such as brand endorsements or social media monetisation, were neither substantiated nor supported by credible evidence of lawful income generation.Kaur had sought bail in acorruption case registered against her on May 26 at the vigilance bureau police station, Bathinda.

US deportation: First flights depart from Florida; 100 detainees leave 'Alligator Alcatraz',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-deportation-first-flights-depart-from-florida-100-detainees-leave-alligator-alcatraz/articleshow/122916007.cms,"



The first deportation flights from Florida’s newly established immigration detention centre in the Everglades have begun, Governor Ron DeSantis announced on Friday (local time), around three weeks after federal detainees started arriving at what appears to be the country’s only state-operated migrant facility.According to DeSantis, approximately 100 detainees have been deported directly from the centre, which state officials have named “Alligator Alcatraz”. Though he did not disclose the destinations, he informed that hundreds more had been flown to federal deportation hubs in states such as Louisiana. The flights, he said, were operated by the Department of Homeland Security.The facility, described by immigration experts as one of a kind, consists of a collection of quickly assembled tents and trailers on a disused airfield. DeSantis said it had been fitted with ground-to-air communications, radar, and runway lighting, along with a stock of 5,000 gallons of jet fuel, as per the New York Times.“This airport is able to accept commercial flight aircraft and conduct both day and nighttime operations,” he said.While state officials maintain that detainees at the site are under final deportation orders from the federal government, immigration lawyers argue they have not been granted sufficient access to clients held there.The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed a lawsuit last week, citing lack of legal counsel and due process violations.“The US Constitution does not allow the government to simply lock people away without any ability to communicate with counsel or to petition the court for release from custody,” Eunice Cho, senior counsel with the ACLU’s National Prison Project and lead lawyer in the case, told the New York Times.Head of the Florida Division of Emergency Management, Kevin Guthrie, said that on-site lawyer visits “should be starting” on Monday. He explained that previous delays were due to technological issues.Environmental groups have also launched legal action to stop construction of the detention centre, which is located on land surrounded by protected areas. Guthrie dismissed these concerns at the news conference, claiming the old training airport once hosted “over a hundred flights a day,” though this claim could not be immediately verified.Florida is utilising the county-owned airfield, located in Miami-Dade, under emergency powers.DeSantis stated the centre currently has space for “a couple thousand” detainees, with Guthrie noting that capacity is expected to double to around 4,000. Should the facility reach full capacity, DeSantis said the state plans to open a second centre in North Florida.State officials have defended the projected $450 million annual operating cost, some of which is expected to be reimbursed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, insisting it is necessary to maintain “law and order.” Critics, including some Republicans, have pointed out that the cost per detainee is higher than in state prisons or ICE facilities.Initially, the state published contracts with facility contractors online, but the DeSantis administration later removed the full agreements, leaving only summaries available. Guthrie claimed the full documents contained proprietary information and should not have been posted publicly.Florida is also seeking approval to appoint Judge Advocate General Corps officers from the Florida National Guard as immigration judges at the Everglades site to speed up deportations. DeSantis said federal approval for this has yet to be granted.Reports from detainees have described poor conditions at the facility, including limited food and infrequent showers. When pressed by journalists, DeSantis and Guthrie defended the conditions, with DeSantis sarcastically dismissing complaints about food, saying detainees wanted “toasted hoagies.”In a related move, Florida has introduced a pilot programme to encourage undocumented immigrants to self-deport, according to Larry Keefe, executive director of the state’s new immigration oversight board. Keefe said the initiative, conducted in partnership with Customs and Border Protection, is separate from a federal scheme that offers $1,000 and a plane ticket to undocumented migrants willing to return to their home country.On Friday, DeSantis said “a couple dozen” individuals had voluntarily left the US under the pilot programme.","Governor Ron DeSantis announced the first deportation flights from Florida's new immigration detention centre in the Everglades on Friday.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

"Media merger: CBS owner Paramount to enter $8.4B deal with Skydance, after lawsuit settlement with Trump; new owners commit $20 mn to pro MAGA ads",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/media-merger-cbs-owner-paramount-to-enter-8-4b-deal-with-skydance-after-lawsuit-settlement-with-trump-new-owners-commit-20-mn-to-pro-maga-ads/articleshow/122892106.cms,"The US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has officially approved the $8.4 billion merger between Paramount Global and Skydance Media, clearing the final regulatory hurdle for a deal that had faced months of political and legal wrangling.The merger will hand over control of some of the biggest names in entertainment, CBS, Paramount Pictures, the Paramount+ streaming service, and cable networks like MTV, Nickelodeon, and Comedy Central, to independent studio Skydance, backed by billionaire David Ellison and investment firm RedBird Capital.“We’re going to celebrate now,” a source close to Skydance told The New York Post. “We’re all beat up. Just exhuasted, but it was well worth it. The next step is to close the deal early by Aug 7.”The FCC’s decision, passed by a 2-1 vote, came just weeks after Paramount paid $16 million to settle a lawsuit filed by Donald Trump over a 2020 “60 Minutes” interview with then-vice president Kamala Harris, which the president claimed was deceptively edited to sway the 2024 election. While CBS denied the allegation, it chose to settle to avoid any delays to the merger.Crucial to gaining FCC approval were assurances from Ellison, son of Oracle founder Larry Ellison, and RedBird Capital that the new management would ensure unbiased journalism at CBS. The company has promised to appoint an independent ombudsman to oversee complaints related to editorial fairness and transparency, the New York Post reported.In a move seen as politically charged, Paramount also scrapped its diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives to align with the Trump administration’s stance, which argues such policies amount to discrimination.“Americans no longer trust the legacy national news media to report fully, accurately, and fairly,” said FCC Chair Brendan Carr, a Trump appointee.""It is time for a change. That is why I welcome Skydance’s commitment to make significant changes at the once storied CBS broadcast network.""Dissenting FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez, the sole Democratic vote against the deal, condemned the decision, saying, “After months of cowardly capitulation to this administration, Paramount finally got what it wanted.”As part of the deal, Shari Redstone, the controlling shareholder of Paramount Global, will receive $1.75 billion in cash and step down from the company’s board. Her departure marks the end of the Redstone family’s direct influence over the media empire her father, Sumner Redstone, built.Skydance, known for producing hits like Top Gun: Maverick and Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning, will merge with Paramount to form “Paramount Skydance Corp.” The newly formed company will remain publicly traded but under the control of the Ellison family. David Ellison will serve as chairman and CEO, while former NBCUniversal boss Jeff Shell will become president.The FCC also approved the transfer of 28 CBS-owned TV station licences to the new company. This came shortly after CBS abruptly cancelled The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, citing financial reasons. The programme, despite strong ratings, was reportedly losing $40 million a year.Trump, who originally sued Paramount for $20 billion, claimed this week that the real settlement was closer to $36 million. The new owners committed $20 million to run pro-MAGA public service ads.The merger marks a dramatic turning point for Paramount, which has struggled in recent years with declining revenues and the challenges of streaming-era disruption. Redstone had initially reunited CBS and Viacom in 2019 in a bid to strengthen the company’s competitive footing, but the rapidly changing media landscape proved difficult to navigate.With the deal now approved, all eyes will be on Ellison and Skydance as they take the reins of one of America’s most iconic media brands.","The US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has officially approved the $8.4 billion merger between Paramount Global and Skydance Media.

No more beef over beef: Australia to finally take a bite of American meat; 'we are going to sell so much' says Donald Trump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/no-more-beef-over-beef-australia-to-finally-take-a-bite-of-american-meat-we-are-going-to-sell-so-much-says-donald-trump/articleshow/122893889.cms,"Australians will be finally biting onto American meet burgers and steaks as Canberra has decided to remove the trade barriers obstructing US meat's way into the country.US President Donald Trump on Thursday (local time) hailed Australia's decision to lift a decades-long ban on American beef as a “historic win” and proof that US produce is the “safest and best in the entire world. ”In a triumphant post on his social media platform, the US president declared, “After many years Australia has agreed to accept American Beef! For a long time, and even though we are great friends, they actually banned our Beef. Now, we are going to sell so much to Australia because this is undeniable and irrefutable Proof that US Beef is the Safest and Best in the entire World.”He further added, “The other Countries that refuse our magnificent Beef are ON NOTICE. All of our Nation’s Ranchers, who are some of the hardest working and most wonderful people, are smiling today, which means I am smiling too. Let’s keep the Hot Streak going. IT’S THE GOLDEN AGE OF AMERICA!”The announcement comes after a spell of strained trade ties between the two allies, during which Trump accused Australia of profiting from beef exports to the US while blocking American meat from entering its own market.In April, during the unveiling of the “Liberation Day” tariffs, he threatened a 10% baseline import duty on Australian goods, further straining ties with Canberra.Responding to the breakthrough, US trade representative Jamieson Greer called the decision a “major milestone” in removing unjust trade barriers, adding that President Trump’s firm stance had “unlocked market access” that had long been denied to American farmers.“Yesterday's decision by Australia marks a major milestone in lowering trade barriers and securing market access for US farmers and ranchers. President Trump is taking decisive action to confront unfair trading practices, and Australia's decision to unlock market access for U.S. beef is a direct result of his leadership,” the ambassador said.Secretary of agriculture Brooke Rollins echoed the sentiment, criticising what she described as “non-scientific trade barriers” and framing the announcement as part of a broader effort to put American agriculture back at the forefront of global trade.“American farmers and ranchers produce the safest, healthiest beef in the world. It's absurd that non-scientific trade barriers prevented our beef from being sold to consumers in Australia for the last 20 years.”Australian officials, for their part, attributed the policy shift to improved quality control measures introduced by US meat producers. Agriculture minister Julie Collins said the updated protocols had addressed Australia’s long-standing biosecurity concerns.Australia has historically enforced strict import rules, including rejecting beef from US cattle born in Mexico or Canada.The move coincides with the 20th anniversary of the US-Australia Free Trade Agreement (AUSFTA).A press release from the US government said that over the last two decades, US Trade Representative and department of agriculture have worked tirelessly to secure and uphold American ranchers' access to international beef markets, ensuring they fully benefit from trade agreements.","US President Donald Trump hails Australia's decision to lift a decades-long ban on American beef as a ""historic win"" The announcement comes after a spell of strained trade ties between the two allies.

Poliovirus found in 20 Pakistani districts amid rising vaccine refusals: New sewage data signals resurgence; 13th polio case confirmed in 2025,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/poliovirus-found-in-20-pakistani-districts-amid-rising-vaccine-refusals-new-sewage-data-signals-resurgence-13th-polio-case-confirmed-in-2025/articleshow/122421011.cms,"



Pakistan's battle against polio has hit a fresh setback, with the deadly virus detected in sewage samples across 20 districts, including the capital, just as the country grapples with rising vaccine refusal rates.According to ARY News, citing the National Reference Laboratory, 28 sewage samples collected between May 8 and June 17 tested positive for Wild Poliovirus Type 1 (WPV1). The presence of the virus was confirmed in major urban centres such as Lahore, Karachi, and Islamabad, as well as in districts across Sindh, Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir.Sindh reported the highest contamination, with 14 positive samples from 10 districts. Lahore recorded three cases, while Islamabad and four districts in KP also registered positive samples. In Balochistan, the virus was found in Mastung, Khuzdar, and Sibi. Mirpur in PoJK also showed signs of the virus.This alarming development follows Pakistan’s second national polio vaccination drive earlier this year, which saw over 60,000 refusals, 39,000 of them in Karachi alone. These refusals, officials say, are now posing a major roadblock to the country’s eradication efforts.“We’re not just fighting a virus; we’re battling misinformation and mistrust,” a senior health official told ARY News.Pakistan remains one of only two countries where polio is still endemic, the other being Afghanistan. With the confirmation of another new case this week, the total number of polio cases in the country has reached 13 so far in 2025.Health experts warn that the virus spreads primarily through contaminated water or food and can cause paralysis or death. There is no cure for polio, making vaccination the only defense. The World Health Organisation emphasises that multiple oral doses are needed to protect children under five, the group most vulnerable to the disease.Despite ongoing national campaigns, large pockets in southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa remain difficult to access for vaccination teams, leaving thousands of children at risk.As the virus resurfaces in urban and rural sewers alike, officials say the next phase in Pakistan’s anti-polio war must tackle both the virus, and vaccine hesitancy, with equal urgency.","Sindh reported the highest contamination, with 14 positive samples from 10 districts.
