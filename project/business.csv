"Barbed wire to blue indigo, Indian art shines at Art Dubai",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/barbed-wire-to-blue-indigo-indian-art-shines-at-art-dubai/articleshow/120918047.cms,"Gallery espace showed Manjunath Kamath's wor among others

<p>Artist Imran Qureshi and Alserkal director Nada Raza<br></p>

With M F Husain becoming the first Indian artist to have broken the Rs 100 crore barrier in March, it was fitting that his works created a buzz in the only other place he called home. At this year’s Art Dubai , DAG curated a solo booth of his works that showcased not just his trademark horses but also his versatility.While Husain shone brightly in the Modern masters section, Indian contemporary art , too, proved that it could draw collectors, not just in India but across the world.Priyanka Raja, founder of Experimenter which started in Kolkata and has since expanded to Mumbai, said the gallery had its best opening day in Art Dubai's almost two-decade history, selling over 80 per cent of their presentation in the first hours to institutions and private collections in the US, Europe and West Asia.Experimenter was one of 11 Indian galleries which had booths at the fair that has set itself apart from other global offerings with its mix of grit and glamour. Where else will you see Palestinian artists, whose works tell stories of displacement and grief? Or a cutting-edge digital section that shows you new ways in which art and technology can intersect? “At most fairs, you see the same works and the same people but not here,” points out Art Dubai’s executive director Benedetta Ghione.Though its many skyscrapers have their windows tightly shut and almost no one is drying their chaddi-banians on the balcony, Dubai still feels like home to visiting Indians like me. Familiar faces, a familiar khichdi of accents and flavours, and even in the curated environs of an art fair, themes that resonate.At the booth of Gallery Espace , artist Ishita Chakraborty uses barbed wire as a metaphor for the struggles and challenges of migrants while veteran and eternally playful Manjunath Kamath creates a fictional language while referencing temple art, Yakshagana plays and Indian epics.Right opposite was Blueprint12 which dedicated an entire booth to the works of textile artist Kaimurai whose indigo hues have a deeply meditative quality. “Though I live in Bengaluru, I have spent many years in Chennai and Carnatic music has a deep influence on my art,” says Abhishek Ganesh who goes by the name Kaimurai. Though Blueprint12, a gallery from Delhi, was a first-time participant at the fair, it almost sold out Kaimurai’s works.Within hours of the VIP preview opening, several works had been snapped up at Shrine Empire’s booth as well. And these were not the usual ‘pretty pictures’ that sell well with buyers who want artworks that go with the décor rather than raise uncomfortable questions. One of the highlights of the booth was work by the self-taught artist duo of Baaran and Moonis Ijlal who captured the stories of women who lived through the partition of 1947.Shrine Empire, co-founded by Shefali Somani and Anahita Taneja, like many of the Indian galleries showed not just Indian artists but from across South Asia. And this wasn’t their first time. Long before demand for Sri Lankan and Bangladeshi art took off, the gallery has been championing artists like Anoli Perera and Tayeba Begum Lipi.Mumbai gallery Jhaveri Contemporary’s booth showed how diverse and rich South Asian art is. There was Ali Kazim from Lahore whose brushwork reminds of the finesse of miniature paintings, Sri Lankan Lionel Wendt’s photographs, Marseille-based Vasantha Yogananthan’s Ramayana-inspired works and much more.And the exchange went both ways with global galleries showing Indian artists. One of them was Galleria Continua from Paris, which has had a long relationship with Indian artists such as Subodh and Shilpa Gupta as well as British-Indian artist Anish Kapoor, and shows them at many international fairs.But there was more outside the fair too. Imagine getting to plonk on a humble charpai in hipsterized Alserkal Avenue, one of Dubai’s buzzy art districts where the trendy come to down matcha smoothies and avocado toast. Except that this was no ordinary cot but a vital piece of Pakistani artist Imran Qureshi’s installation supported by an Indian gallery and the Dubai-based Alserkal Arts Foundation. Nada Raza, director of Alserkal Arts Foundation who put together the show, says the exhibition came together through sheer serendipity.“Nature Morte gallery had been waiting for the opportunity to support a major international exhibition for Imran. Imran happened to be in Dubai more often because of his cultural Golden Visa. So, it’s an Indo-Pak collaboration amongst old friends who’ve had the opportunity to find a generous home at Alserkal Avenue. It’s a real Dubai story,” she says.The layered charpai work resonated not only with the artsy crowd but also with the workers installing the show, most of whom were South Asian migrants. “When we were done installing, the crew spontaneously gathered round and asked for a photo with Imran bhai. I then found two of the installers looking carefully at the photographs together and having a pretty intense discussion,"" says Raza, adding that she also found people just sitting on stools that are part of the installation to grab a moment of respite.Walk a few metres into Ishara Art Foundation’s space and there was Mumbai artist Shilpa Gupta with her first solo in West Asia, reminding you of the arbitrariness of border walls with these evocative lines: ‘I tried very hard to cut the sky in half, one half for my lover and the other half for me, but the sky kept moving and clouds from his territory came into mine…’ Gupta’s work might be spare relying largely on lines and maps to question how nation-states exert control. In a darkened room, microphones recite the lines of silenced and dissident poets. ‘Hum Dekhenge’ by Faiz Ahmed Faiz floats through the air, an anthem of protest that reminds you that tyranny can be fought in many ways.","M F Husain became the first Indian artist to have broken the Rs 100 crore barrier in March.

Prolonged tension to hurt Pakistan's economy: Moody's,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/prolonged-tension-to-hurt-pak-eco-moodys/articleshow/120913946.cms,"NEW DELHI: A sustained escalation in tension with India could hurt Pakistan's growth, impact its fiscal consolidation and macroeconomic stability, Moody's Rating warned on Monday. In contrast, it does not expect a significant impact on India, apart from higher defence spending weighing on govt's fiscal consolidation plan.Pakistan was on the brink of bankruptcy until the International Monetary Fund bailed it out once again, provided it met several conditions. Its credit rating, Caa2+ according to Moody's, is speculative grade, signalling its weak fundamentals.""Pakistan's macroeconomic conditions have been improving, with growth gradually rising, inflation declining and foreign-exchange reserves increasing, amid continued progress in the IMF programme. A persistent increase in tensions could also impair Pakistan's access to external financing and pressure its foreign-exchange reserves, which remain well below what is required to meet its external debt payment needs for the next few years,"" Moody's said.Apart from assistance from multilateral agencies, including IMF and the World Bank, Pakistan had also managed to roll over debt from Saudi Arabia, China and UAE to tide over the foreign exchange and debt crisis.The weak sentiments are also reflected in stock market indices. Pakistan's benchmark KSE-100 index fell another 635 points on May 5. Since April 23, the index has lost over 7,500 points, or 6% due to fears of a conflict.Indian markets have, however, held up. ""Comparatively, the macroeconomic conditions in India would be stable, bolstered by moderating but still high levels of growth, amid strong public investment and healthy private consumption. In a scenario of sustained escalation in localised tensions, we do not expect major disruptions to India's economic activity because it has minimal economic relations with Pakistan (less than 0.5% of India's total exports in 2024),"" Moody's said.Moody's is not budgeting for a broad-based military conflict. ""Our geopolitical risk assessment for Pakistan and India accounts for persistent tensions, which have, at times, led to limited military responses. We assume that flare-ups will occur periodically... but that they will not lead to an outright military conflict.""","A sustained escalation in tension with India could hurt Pakistan's growth, impact its fiscal consolidation and macroeconomic stability.

"Maternity payout covers just 20% of births, claim activists",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/maternity-payout-covers-just-20-of-births-claim-activists/articleshow/120912531.cms,"NEW DELHI: Right to Food activists have expressed concern over barely 20% of births each year being covered by govt's maternity benefit scheme, despite the National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013, guaranteeing Rs 6,000 as legal entitlement of all pregnant women.Data given to RS in March showed that only 54 lakh beneficiaries were paid in 2024-25, much lower than almost 73 lakh in 2022-23, but an improvement over 22.5 lakh beneficiaries in 2023-24. The estimated number of births per year in India is 270 lakh.Giving maternity benefit of Rs 6,000 per child for 90% of the 270 lakh births would require an annual expenditure of over Rs 14,500 crore. However, the allocation for the maternity benefit scheme, Prime Minister's Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY), has stagnated below Rs 2,000 crore in the last few years. The entitlement has not been revised since 2013, which means in real terms it has gone down after adjusting for inflation. Even by a very conservative estimate, maternity benefits should have been raised to at least Rs 12,000, argued the Right to Food activists.In April 2017, the women and child development ministry told Supreme Court that all pregnant women would receive Rs 6,000 under Section 4 of the NFSA. But instead, the PMMVY was implemented, reducing the benefit to Rs 5,000, restricting it to the first child (or second if it's a girl), and imposing multiple conditionalities.To get Rs 3,000 (first instalment), pregnancy must be registered and one ante-natal check-up done within six months at an approved facility. For Rs 2,000 (second instalment), childbirth must be registered and the child vaccinated with the first cycle of immunisations.Eligibility is limited to disadvantaged women who must prove it with documents like ration or BPL cards. Further, women below age of 18 years and seven months are not eligible. Many documents are required, including Aadhaar card, Aadhaar-mapped bank/post office account details, mobile number, eligibility proof, Mother and Child Protection card or Reproductive and Child Health card, date of last menstrual period, date of ante-natal check-up, child's birth certificate, and child immunisation details.Due to these conditions, most women are excluded. In 2023-24, only 2.7 lakh women (about 1%) received the second instalment. In contrast, Tamil Nadu and Odisha provide Rs 18,000 and Rs 10,000 per pregnancy, with 84% and 64% birth coverage respectively.","Right to Food activists have expressed concern over barely 20% of births each year being covered by govt's maternity benefit scheme.

NEW DELHI: Limited flushing and desilting of reservoirs of two run-of-the-river hydro-power projects - Baglihar and Salal - on the Chenab river in Jammu and Kashmir—are being undertaken by India in an immediate move to prepare them for storing and regulating flow of water to Pakistan during the winters. More dams will undergo the process in coming days to ensure better storage in India.The move is part of the country’s detailed roadmap, prepared after suspension of the Indus Water Treaty (IWT) following the Pahalgam terror attack last month, to prevent and regulate flow of western rivers - Indus, Jhelum and Chenab - to the neighbouring country.Flushing is a process to clear sediments from the reservoir by operating it in a particular way using high water flow whereas desilting can be done through dredging to remove large deposited sediment.“Since the Treaty is on pause and there is no obligation to follow its provisions, we may do flushing on any project without any obligation. It will ensure longer effective life of such projects,” Kushvinder Vohra, former chairman, Central Water Commission, told TOI.He said typical projects like Baglihar and Kishanganga with smaller live poundages may complete the flushing process in about one to two days.Desilting/flushing of reservoirs is part of short-term measures under the roadmap whereas expediting under construction hydro-power projects such as Pakal Dul (1000 MW), Ratle (850 MW), Kiru (624 MW) and Kwar (540 mw) would be the medium-term measure.Curbing flow of nine cusecs of water from Kishanganga as required as per earlier award and using it for production of more power for India would be another measure that can be taken up in short-term, Vohra said.There are four more power projects which are in the pipeline as long-term measures which will make it possible for India to utilise adequate water from the western rivers using accompanying reservoirs. These projects will not only increase India’s hydro-power capacity in Jammu & Kashmir from nearly 4,000 MW to over 10,000 MW but also increase the water storage capacity which can be used in the UT and neighbouring states.Other measures under the roadmap include taking up Tulbul project on Jhelum which was stalled earlier; works on Wuller lake and Jhelum for better flood management; lift projects which may take comparatively lesser time to use water; and adequate use of existing Ranbir and Pratap canals to ensure more water for Jammu region.“Many other things can also be done which may unfold at an appropriate time,” said Vohra.","Flushing and desilting of reservoirs of two run-of-the-river hydro-power projects - Baglihar and Salal - on the Chenab river in Jammu and Kashmir.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan is continuing with its state policy of fuelling cross-border terrorism through state and non-state proxies, and attacks like Pahalgam destabilise and jeopardise regional peace and security, defence minister Rajnath Singh told his Japanese counterpart General Nakatani on Monday.With Pakistan on Saturday testing the 450-km Abdali ballistic missile system in a reckless, escalatory and provocative move, the delegation-level meeting saw India also point to Pakistan's active role in nuclear and missile proliferation, which is a source of insecurity and instability for countries around the world, sources told TOI.The meeting saw both sides condemn ""terrorism in all its forms"" and emphasised the need for enhanced global cooperation and joint efforts to counter cross-border threats. ""Nakatani San expressed solidarity with India in the wake of the Pahalgam attack and offered full support to India,"" Singh said.While the two ministers also reaffirmed their commitment to further strengthen the defence and security pillars of their bilateral 'special strategic and global partnership' and contribute towards regional peace, the major focus was on terrorism and Pakistan's role in promoting it.Singh condemned Pakistan's state policy of cross-border terrorism against India, perpetrated through state and non-state actors. He called for a unified stand against terrorism and the ""state-sponsored actions that perpetuate it"".Sources said the Indian side stressed that ""everyone needs to be mindful of the fact that terrorists coming out of terror training factories in Pakistan"" have committed attacks in several countries.Gen Nakatani, on his part, said terrorism could not be justified on any grounds, and Japan remained determined to resolutely fight the menace jointly with the international community, including India. He also expressed hope the countries concerned would take responsible actions for the sake of peace and stability in South Asia. On the proliferation front, China has played a major role in facilitating the clandestine network that has enabled Pakistan and North Korea to progressively strengthen their nuclear and ballistic missile arsenals.India and Japan have full strategic convergence on China's aggressive expansionist moves in the Indo-Pacific region, and along with the other 'Quad' countries of the US and Australia have openly declared their intent to deter any coercion in the region. Japan regularly takes part in the top-tier Malabar naval exercise, which began as a bilateral exercise between India and the US in 1992 but now includes all four 'Quad' countries.The two also conduct the Dharma Guardian exercise between their armies, JIMEX between navies and Veer Guardian between air forces, and have also operationalised their reciprocal military logistics pact. ""The ministers welcomed the growing diversity and frequency of defence exercises and exchanges, and concurred to enhance the scope and complexity of these engagements. They agreed to add new dimensions to the robust bilateral maritime cooperation,"" an official said. Singh also outlined the capability of the Indian defence industry, particularly its potential to collaborate with Japan on new areas like tank engines and aero engines. Both sides agreed to enhance industrial cooperation, including exploring collaboration in niche domains such as automation and AI, as also take forward the collaboration in emerging areas like cyber and space.","Pakistan is fuelling cross-border terrorism through state and non-state proxies.

Don’t want to reserve any judgment: Outgoing CJI

NEW DELHI: CJI Sanjiv Khanna on Monday passed the baton to incoming CJI B R Gavai for deciding the validity of the contentious Waqf Amendment Act, 2025, and said certain points and figures about waqf properties raised in the affidavit filed by the Centre to oppose the plea for pausing the law needed detailed hearing even for the purpose of passing interim orders.Heading a bench also comprising Justices Sanjay Kumar and K V Viswanathan, CJI Khanna at the outset, with the consent of counsel for the rival sides, referred the bunch of petitions challenging the Act to CJI-designate Gavai and fixed hearing for May 15, a day after the new CJI takes oath. CJI Khanna retires on May 13.CJI Khanna told solicitor general Tushar Mehta that the court had gone through, even if not minutely, the Union govt’s preliminary response to the petitions. “The govt has raised certain points with regard to registration of land (for a valid waqf) and some figures about waqf properties. These require some consideration. There are some aspects, which require clarification also,” he said.Mehta said the govt had answers to every apprehension expressed by the petitioners and that the Act was intended to benefit individuals in the Muslim community and streamline the management of huge waqf properties. Lead counsel for the Muslim side, senior advocate Kapil Sibal who had pressed for the law to be stayed, responded sarcastically, “He has an answer for everything.”The CJI brought this to an abrupt end by informing the counsel that he did not want to reserve any judgment, or even an interim order for that matter.Tushar Mehta said govt had answers to every apprehension expressed by the petitioners and that the Act was intended to benefit individuals in the Muslim community and streamline the management of huge waqf properties.

On April 17, Mehta had pre-empted the SC from staying certain provisions of the law by assuring that the Centre would make no appointments to the Central Waqf Council and Auqaf Boards and maintain status quo on waqfs, including ‘waqf by user’, already registered or declared under the Waqf Act, 1995.Defending the Waqf Amendment Act, 2025 as a secular law, Centre in its 1,332-page response, which included 1,100 pages of documents, had said the objection to mandatory registration of waqf properties, including ‘waqf by user’, was baseless as it had been in vogue for more than 100 years. It had also given data about huge increase in waqf properties in the last 12 years. All India Muslim Personal Law Board , in its rejoinder affidavit, accused Centre of misleading the SC by giving figures of properties which though were part of waqf prior to 2013 but had not been entered in the centralised portal, Waqf Management System of India.","CJI Sanjiv Khanna passed the baton to incoming CJI B R Gavai for deciding the validity of the contentious Waqf Amendment Act, 2025.

Show material to link C’garh scam accused to proceeds of crime, SC tells additional SG

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Monday flagged what it called the Enforcement Directorate making allegations against accused in money laundering cases without backing them with evidence, and said it has witnessed this trend in many cases.A bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan expressed concern over the investigating agency not substantiating its claims with material to link the accused with proceeds of crime . ""This is what we have seen in umpteen number of cases filed by the ED. This is the pattern, just make allegations without reference to anything,"" the court said. Additional solicitor general S V Raju responded to the remark by saying he would submit evidence to ""dispel the court's impression"" that the agency had been filing cases without having necessary evidence.The court made the observation while hearing the bail plea of one of the accused in the Chhattisgarh liquor scam case, Arvind Singh, after it was not convinced with the agency's submission linking the accused with Rs 40 crore proceeds of crime. Raju said Singh was involved in the multi-crore liquor scam.Additional solicitor general S V Raju said Chhattisgarh liquor scam case accused, Arvind Singh, was involved in the multi-crore liquor scam and he was instrumental in procuring empty liquor bottles through a company Anurag Traders. The ASG said he was running a parallel liquor business in the state causing a scam of over Rs 2,000 crore.The bench asked the ASG to show material to link Singh with the company and with Rs 40 crore proceeds of crime unearthed by the agency. When the court noted that Singh was neither managing director nor director nor held any post in the company, Raju said he was indirectly managing the affairs of the company.As the bench seemed unconvinced, Raju, who was arguing online, sought time to appear in court and place relevant documents to substantiate the allegations against Singh and dispel the bench's impression that allegations were made without proof.Pressing for bail, senior advocate Siddarth Agarwal said his client had already spent 10 months in jail and trial was unlikely to commence in the near future as the probe was still on. He said there were 21 accused in the case and documents running into 25,000 pages had been filed with over 150 witnesses named.Raju, however, said bail could not be sought on ground of filing of voluminous documents and probe was complete on Singh's role. He said the accused had not spent one year in jail, a timeframe considered by the court for granting bail. The bench, however, said there was no such yardstick that bail could be granted only after an accused had spent one year in custody.Interestingly, while speaking at ED's foundation day a few days ago, Raju, who has been the agency's main counsel, cautioned ED not to rush to arrest an accused and said it should be done at a later stage (of investigation) after making a watertight case. ""Gather evidence before arrest and make sure the accused has been linked to 'proceeds of crime' rather than the predicate offence alone,"" he had said. If an accused was arrested at an early stage of investigation, it may not meet the requirement of the law and the accused may get relief from courts, he had suggested, adding that extracting confessions and collecting evidence were easier before an accused was arrested for alleged money laundering, rather than after his arrest. ""Material evidence can be gathered when ED is still investigating a case, so get evidence before arrest. Don't be in haste in arresting,"" he had said.",The court made the observation while hearing the bail plea of one of the accused in the Chhattisgarh liquor scam case.

India registered its protest with the Canadian High Commission in New Delhi, according to official sources.""We conveyed our concerns in the strongest terms to the Canadian High Commission regarding the parade held in Toronto, where unacceptable imagery and threatening language were used against our leadership and Indian citizens residing in Canada,"" stated one source.Indian officials urged Canadian authorities to take action against ""anti-India elements"" promoting hatred, extremism and separatist agendas, the sources indicated. ""We once again call on the Canadian authorities to act against anti-India elements who spread hatred and advocate extremism and separatist agenda,"" the source further added.This tension emerged shortly after Mark Carney's electoral victory as Canadian Prime Minister.Carney, an economist new to politics, secured a remarkable win for the Liberal Party during elections held amidst US President Donald Trump's tariff disputes.His appointment presented a potential opportunity to improve India-Canada relations, which deteriorated significantly during Justin Trudeau's leadership.The bilateral relationship faced serious challenges following Trudeau's September 2023 claims about the ""potential"" involvement of Indian agents in Hardeep Singh Nijjar's death on Canadian soil. India firmly dismissed these allegations as ""absurd"".Relations worsened when Ottawa connected several Indian diplomats, including High Commissioner Sanjay Verma, to Nijjar's death. In October last year, India withdrew Verma and five colleagues, whilst expelling an equal number of Canadian diplomats from New Delhi.Recently, security officials from both nations resumed communications, exploring possibilities for appointing new high commissioners, reported news agency PTI.Trudeau's departure was viewed as a chance for diplomatic improvement. India had criticised Trudeau's administration for allowing pro-Khalistani groups to operate in Canada.Following Trudeau's exit, New Delhi expressed hopes to restore relations with Canada based on ""mutual trust and sensitivity"".","A parade on Sunday reportedly displayed pro-Khalistan propaganda and imagery targeting Indian leaders.

Since the 2024-25 academic session must have progressed significantly, it would not be expedient to grant him admission to that session, concluded the court. The court also stated that in view of the high marks secured by Kabir in the NEET UG 2024 examination (542 out of 720), he shall not be required to undergo the 2025 examination.The court held that denial of admission to Kabir was ""grossly illegal, arbitrary"", and violative of his fundamental rights. ""Such action not only reflects institutional bias and systemic discrimination but also undermines the principles of equal opportunity and non-discrimination enshrined in our constitutional framework. The constitutional mandate of substantive equality demands that persons with disabilities (PwD) and PwBD (people with benchmark disabilities) be afforded reasonable accommodations rather than subjected to exclusionary practices based on unfounded presumptions about their capabilities,"" stated the court in its order.Kabir Paharia had cleared class X with 91.5% and class XII with 90% marks without the help of a scribe to write the exams. Kabir's disability is described as ""congenital absence of multiple fingers in both hands as well as involvement of left foot (2nd and 3rd toe), the extent whereof has been assessed at 42%."" Three of the fingers on his left hand are half-grown, as are two on his right hand. On his left foot, two toes are half-grown. The court further directed the National Medical Commission to complete the process of revising the guidelines in light of its earlier judgments, which emphasised functional assessment rather than an assessment of the extent of disability, within a period of two months and at any cost before the counselling for the 2025-2026 session commences.","Kabir Paharia cleared class X with 91.5% and class XII with 90% marks without the help of a scribe to write the exams.

""How long can this go on,"" he asked.The bench of Justices Kant and N Kotiswar Singh perused the ACRs of Prem Kumar, who was a direct recruit to the post of additional district and sessions judge in Punjab in 2014, and said his track record and integrity was termed good by the supervising judge. However, it suddenly dipped to poor with 'doubtful integrity' in the next year only to dramatically improve to good both in performance and integrity criteria.The rollercoaster evaluation of performance and integrity became routine for Prem Kumar and in April 2022, the HC in administrative side dispensed with his services.To safeguard his dignity, Kumar challenged his dismissal before the high court through a writ petition.In January this year, a division bench of the HC allowed the writ petition, quashed the full court's march 7, 2022, recommendation as well as the order of April 20, 2022 dismissing him from service. The HC appealed against the division bench's order before the SC.Dismissing the appeal, Justice Kant-led bench said, ""Just because he belongs to a lower caste, he is being targeted.

"In closed-door meet, UNSC discusses faceoff",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-closed-door-meet-unsc-discusses-faceoff/articleshow/120911178.cms,"NEW DELHI: UN security council was scheduled to hold closed-door consultations on Monday on the rising India-Pakistan tensions , after Pakistan as a non-permanent member sought a meeting to brief member-states about what it described as India's aggressive behaviour. Pakistan has accused India of preparing to launch an attack on the country despite its own warmongering that has seen it test firing missiles twice in past few days.External affairs minister S Jaishankar has been in touch with council members, including Greece which holds the presidency of the council for May, to drive home India's point about Pakistan's use of terrorism as an instrument of state policy and to mobilise support for India's efforts to bring the perpetrators of the Pahalgam terrorist attack to justice.The UNSC closed-door consultations are of informal nature and unlikely to lead to any substantive outcome in this case - except allowing Pakistan a shot at diplomatic grandstanding - much like the closed consultations Islamabad sought through ally China in 2019 after India revoked the special status of J&K.The discussions - expected to begin around 12.30am IST Tuesday - will take place not under the India-Pakistan Question that involves J&K but the more generic ""threats to international peace and security"". Pakistan had said Sunday it will inform the council about how India's ""aggressive actions are jeopardising regional peace and security"". Pakistan is expected to raise the issue of the Indus Waters Treaty that India put in abeyance after the Pahalgam terrorist attack.While most council members have been supportive of India's zero-tolerance policy against terrorism, India remains wary of China's support to Pakistan in UNSC. This was obvious in the way Pakistan worked with China to water down the council's condemnation of the terrorist attack. Unlike its condemnation of the Pulwama attack in 2019, the council did not ask State to cooperate specifically with the Indian govt and didn't name the terror group that had taken responsibility for the attack.Pakistan said last week that as a member-state it has the right to convene a meeting when it feels appropriate because of the threat to regional and global peace.",UN security council was scheduled to hold closed-door consultations on the rising India-Pakistan tensions.

MUMBAI: Observing that a parent suffering from mental illness is not per se disqualified from custody unless it is shown to endanger the child's welfare, a sessions court dismissed a man's plea to take custody of his 16-year-old son. The man had filed an appeal against a magistrate awarding custody to the mother.""...It is evident that the magistrate interacted with the child, considered the best interest and welfare of the minor, and directed the parties to undergo mediation before passing the order. The magistrate, while granting temporary custody, considered the curriculum course of the child and the natural affection of the mother in the right prospect,"" the judge said.The judge said it is well settled in matters of custody that a minor's welfare is paramount and not parents' legal rights. ""...The minor is nearing adulthood, and the order is only for temporary custody...The magistrate did not commit any jurisdictional error or perversity warranting interference.""The mother had filed a complaint against the father under Domestic Violence (DV) Act in 2022. In March and April this year, orders were issued granting temporary custody of the son to the mother till May 15, and the father was directed to present him in court in Mumbai every month after visitation. A production warrant was also issued following the father's alleged failure to produce the child.The father's counsel said the magistrate's order was passed without giving him a fair opportunity to be heard, thus violating the principle of natural justice. The appeal also said the lower court failed to prioritise the child's welfare, who was already in the father's care in Patna, where he is studying in Class 11. The father's counsel questioned the magistrate's jurisdiction under DV Act to issue such custody orders and said there was no change in circumstances warranting a transfer of custody. Concerns were also raised about a potential trauma to the child due to the sudden change in custody without proper assessment.The mother's advocate highlighted the father's alleged non-compliance with the initial custody order and that he filed the appeal only after the production warrant was issued. Allegations regarding the mother's mental health were dismissed as unsubstantiated and defamatory, with a medical report presented as evidence of her sound mental state. The court was also told that the father had previously filed a transfer application before the chief metropolitan magistrate, which was rejected in Dec 2024, and that he had not complied with similar custody directions in the past.The sessions court found no evidence to support the father's claims that the magistrate ignored the child's academic commitments or that the mother has a mental illness.",A sessions court dismissed a man's plea to take custody of his 16-year-old son.

‘Orders reserved for eternity’: Supreme Court asks HCs for pending cases data,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/orders-reserved-for-eternity-supreme-court-asks-hcs-for-pending-cases-data/articleshow/120910396.cms,"SC bench seeks details of 75 appeals disposed of in a week by J'khand HC

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Monday termed as ""very disturbing"" the practice of certain high court judges ""reserving judgments for eternity"" in breach of litigants' fundamental right to speedy justice and asked registrars general of all 25 HCs to submit details of cases in which orders had been reserved before Jan 31 and verdicts were yet to be pronounced.The SC's move had a dramatic fallout as Jharkhand HC, according to a petitioner's lawyer, delivered verdicts later in the day in two appeals where it had reserved judgements since 2022 and acquitted the convicts. The HC has scheduled final orders for Tuesday in two other cases where it had reserved verdicts long ago.There are at least two judges, one each in Telangana HC and Gauhati HC, who have between them reserved judgments in hundreds of cases and are yet to deliver final orders.Telangana HC's T Vinod Kumar, heading a division bench, has kept more than 50 judgments reserved. Sitting as a single judge, he has reserved verdicts in over 150 cases - 13 in 2020 and over 70 each in 2022 and 2023, SC sources told TOI based on a complaint circulated among senior SC judges including the CJI.The SC order stemmed from a petition argued by advocate Fauzia Shakil, who informed the court that four lifers had filed appeals against their conviction between 2012 and 2018 in Jharkhand HC, which had not pronounced verdicts even three years after reserving judgments.A bench of Justices Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh, which had called for details of such instances from the Jharkhand HC registrar general, expanded the scope and wanted to know the state of affairs in every HC.""We would like to lay down some mandatory guidelines to expedite delivery of judgments. It cannot be allowed to go on like this (reserving judgments and forgetting about it),"" Justice Kant said.The Jharkhand HC registrar general's report, without mentioning the four appeals, said division benches had reserved judgments in as many as 56 matters between Jan 2022 and Dec 2024, but no final order had been passed yet.Single judge benches had reserved orders in 11 cases between July-Sept 2024 in which verdicts were yet to come.The court also referred to a newspaper report which said that Jharkhand high court had disposed of 75 appeals within a week of the apex court order of April 23 seeking details of four cases in which judgments were reserved without pronouncing judgments.The bench sought details of the 75 appeals disposed of in a week and soft copies of the judgments. It also asked the high court to inform about the fate of the four appeals, which advocate Shakil had mentioned.Expanding the ambit of adjudication from Jharkhand to all high courts, the bench asked registrars general of all 25 high courts to submit within four weeks reports on cases in which division benches and single judge benches had reserved verdicts before Jan 31 and were yet to pronounce verdicts.However, it decided to hear the Jharkhand related issue on May 11 while asking the Jharkhand Legal Services Authority to take immediate steps to find out those who have not been able to appeal against conviction in Supreme Court because of the HC indefinitely reserving orders on their appeals.","Jharkhand HC delivered verdicts later in the day in two appeals where it had reserved judgements since 2022 and acquitted the convicts.

However, government data contradicts this narrative. Grocery prices have increased 2.4% over the past year, while average gas prices, though down 10% from last year, remain at $3.18 a gallon according to AAA.Economists argue that without the inflationary threat posed by tariffs, the Fed might have considered lowering rates to stimulate borrowing and growth.“You could imagine a world where there isn't pressure from the Trump administration and they cut rates ... sooner,” said Preston Mui, economist at Employ America, suggesting that political interference has made a rate cut more complicated.Powell has acknowledged that tariffs could lead to a “one-time price increase” but warned they “could also be more persistent,” indicating a prolonged wait before any policy shift. Some economists believe the Fed might not ease rates until September or later, though market pricing shows expectations of a potential cut as early as July if economic conditions deteriorate.Amid this uncertainty, political scrutiny of the Fed continues to rise. Elon Musk, who heads Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency, criticised the Fed for spending $2.5 billion on building renovations. “Since at the end of the day, this is all taxpayer money, we should certainly look to see if indeed the Federal Reserve is spending $2.5 billion on their interior designer,” he said.The Fed defended the costs, citing post-pandemic spikes in construction expenses and local zoning laws requiring underground expansion.Former Fed governor Kevin Warsh, seen as a possible successor to Powell, added to the criticism, stating, “The Fed's current wounds are largely self-inflicted,” and called for a “strategic reset” to restore credibility.Nevertheless, Powell maintains that the institution’s independence remains intact. “Fed independence is very widely understood and supported in Washington, in Congress, where it really matters,” he said last month.","The US Federal Reserve is widely expected to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged at around 4.3% when it concludes its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday.

Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway are contemplating the future of the conglomerate following Warren Buffett 's unexpected announcement of stepping down as chief executive by year end. While most acknowledging that the company will remain stable under Vice Chairman Greg Abel's leadership who Buffett endorsed to be his successor, some stakeholders express concern about the absence of Buffett's unique insight and charisma.The $1.16 trillion organisation, encompassing 189 operating businesses, $264 billion in stocks and $348 billion in cash, faces uncertainty regarding its trajectory post-Buffett era. The announcement came after the annual meeting's question-answer session, with the board scheduled to discuss the transition.""There has been a premium on Berkshire because of Buffett,"" said Mark Malek, chief investment officer at Siebert.NXT, as quoted by news agency Reuters. ""Will people look at it in the same way?""Richard Casterline, a computer programmer from Denver, found the news startling and expressed interest in the market's reaction. He said, ""I don't think (Abel) elicits the same excitement. It's not any fault of his own, it's just thinking of who could be as legendary as those two are. It's just tough shoes to fill.""Despite concerns, Abel receives substantial support. Daniel Hanson senior portfolio manager at Neuberger Berman expressed complete confidence in Abel's capabilities, ""This is Buffett's baby, and he thoughtfully and deliberately planned for an orderly succession that does not disrupt the value of his life's work,"" he said, adding, ""I have full confidence in Greg's leadership.""Richard Lancaster compared the transition to Apple's leadership change from Steve Jobs to Tim Cook and adding, ""You have two different personalities, two different approaches.""""Greg has all the qualities Warren likes in a manager: very sharp individual, and well-versed in what's in the business climate today and the changes that will come through disruptive technologies,"" he also said.Under Buffett's stewardship, Berkshire's shareholder returns have consistently outperformed the S&P 500 (.SPX). The company's investment decisions often influenced market movements, even when Buffett wasn't directly involved.Abel's approach suggests possible adjustments. He indicated increased involvement in subsidiary oversight whilst maintaining their autonomy. Berkshire's diverse portfolio includes Geico insurance, BNSF railway, utilities, Dairy Queen, Fruit of the Loom and See's Candies, as reported by Reuters.The new leadership might adopt different approaches to business retention and divestment. Previously, Berkshire sold Applied Underwriters in 2019 and its newspaper holdings in 2020 due to market changes.","Warren Buffett to pass baton to Greg Abel by year end.

NEW DELHI: Delhi Development Authority (DDA) and Municipal Corporation (MCD) on Monday carried out a drive to remove encroachments and demolish illegal structures on the banks of the Taimoor Nagar drain in southeast Delhi. According to sources, more than half a dozen bulldozers were pressed into action from 9am onwards.The illegal encroachments, spanning over half a kilometre, have been obstructing the flow of sewage and leading to frequent waterlogging in the area. Despite several notices served by the administration, the residents did not pay any heed.The matter eventually landed in Delhi High Court. On April 17, HC said a settlement next to a drain was ineligible for regularisation while examining a topographical survey and drain alignment plan presented by the Special Task Force (STF) chairperson. It found significant illegal occupations across the drain's width, attributing it to negligence by authorities, including DDA, Delhi govt, MCD and DJB. It instructed STF to commence drain construction work without delay.On April 28, HC directed DDA to begin the demolition of the illegal structures from May. It also directed the authorities to expeditiously complete the work of desilting the drain and clearing the garbage.An MCD official said the action was led by DDA. An official from DDA said that the demolition was carried out by the STF, as per high court's directions. During the drive, a large number of personnel drawn from Delhi Police and paramilitary forces were deployed to control the situation, apart from DDA and municipality officials.However, a few locals questioned the demolition drive, saying they had been living in the area for the past 40-50 years, and the notice was served a few days ago. They claimed that they did not have any place to shift and demanded that Delhi govt make arrangements for their rehabilitation.","The illegal encroachments, spanning over half a kilometre, have been obstructing the flow of sewage and leading to frequent waterlogging in the area.

Protesting the move Monday, a total of 23 organisations in Mt Abu expressed strong opposition to the proposed renaming of the hill station to ‘Abu Raj Tirth', which was first discussed during a municipal meeting in Oct 2024.The controversy erupted following a letter from the Department of Local Self Governance to the Mount Abu municipal body, dated April 25, which sought input on the proposed name change. Official documents accessed by TOI showed that the department referenced earlier communications from the Chief Minister's Office, indicating that discussions about the renaming began as far back as Oct 2024. The department letter specifically cites a UO note from the deputy director (statistics) dated April 15, calling for the submission of factual comments on the proposal.Organisations protesting the renaming argued that the proposal lacks public consent and could shift Mount Abu's identity from a vibrant tourist destination to a religious pilgrimage site. The protesters claimed that a local MLA, supported by a minister, was pushing for a complete ban on the open consumption of meat and alcohol in Mount Abu, citing the area's ancient religious significance. Local stakeholders have expressed alarm that implementing such restrictions could further diminish the hill station's attractiveness to visitors.A stakeholder said, ""An MLA in the state assembly wishes to change the name without public consent. The Chief Minister is scheduled to visit Abu in the second or third week of May, and a decision might be taken then.""Saurabh Gangadia, secretary of Mount Abu Hotel Association, said, ""If the govt changes the name of the hill station, tourism will collapse. It will lead to mass unemployment. After liquor and non-veg are prohibited, who will visit the hill station?""Vikas Seth, president of the Nakki Lake Association, highlighted the misleading implications of branding Mount Abu as a pilgrimage centre, suggesting it would deter tourists who currently flock to the area. ""The proposed change to ‘Abu Raj Tirth' sends a misleading message, suggesting a shift from a tourist destination to a religious pilgrimage centre,"" Seth said.A town vending committee member added that declaring Mount Abu a pilgrimage site would impose numerous social and religious restrictions, which the current infrastructure is ill-equipped to support.""Mount Abu is the most visited tourist destination across seven states in the region. Tourists travel great distances to visit it but may no longer wish to do so after a name change,"" he warned.Mount Abu's historical significance dates back to 1830, when the East India Company's Rajputana Agency leased the area from the Sirohi princely state. In 1845, it was officially designated as the summer headquarters of the Agency due to its pleasant climate, which led to the development of the hill station.","Rajasthan govt is planning to change the name of its only hill station, Mt Abu.

NEW DELHI: A man driving a Mahindra Thar deliberately crushed a security guard under the SUV for objecting to the driver’s incessant honking, near southwest Delhi’s Mahipalpur flyover on Sunday. The victim, Rajiv Kumar, 35, suffered around 10 fractures and other injuries.Around 6.30am, Kumar was returning home after a night shift when the SUV started trailing him and honking loudly. “It felt deliberate. I asked them why they were honking so much,” Kumar said.After a brief altercation, Kumar said he stepped back to let the vehicle pass. But the driver allegedly drove straight into him. “I was knocked down and crushed under the tyre. Somehow, I managed to save my head from being crushed,” he said.The SUV driver, a resident of Rangpuri near Vasant Kunj, has been arrested. Kumar, who works in a private company at IGI Airport, narrated the sequence of events. “I had just finished my night shift at the airport, 10pm to 6am. The company car usually drops me at a certain point, and from there, it’s a short walk to my rented home in Mahipalpur,” the 35-year-old told TOI .He was just 10 steps away from home when the incident occurred. “There were four or five men inside. They started abusing me. Then they noticed the baton in my hand, which is part of my security gear, and said, ‘Danda dede humein’ (Give us the stick). When I refused, they started threatening me, saying things like, ‘Tujhe maar denge’ (We’ll kill you). One of them even said, ‘Tujhpe gaadi chadha denge’ (We’ll run you over).""The guard alleged that the men in the backseat were provoking the driver. “They were saying, ‘Agar tu nahi chala pa raha toh humein de, hum chadha dete hain’ (If you can’t do it, let me drive, I’ll run him over). I didn’t understand what I had done to deserve this kind of aggression. I just wanted to get away, so I tried to calm things down and moved back to let their vehicle pass.”The SUV, however, allegedly mowed him down. The guard suffered fractures in more than 10 places in both legs.Police received information regarding the incident at Vasant Kunj South police station. A case under attempt to murder was registered and a police team scanned CCTV footage from the area to identify the vehicle.“Within six hours, the accused, 24-year-old Vijay alias Lale, was traced and arrested. The offending vehicle, belonging to one of his relatives living in Vasant Kunj was seized,” a senior police officer said.Kumar is the sole breadwinner for his family. “My wife and one-year-old child live in Bihar because I can’t afford to keep them here. My father is too old to work, and my brother isn’t mentally stable. Now I’m out of work, bedridden, and need money for an operation. I don’t know what I’m going to do,"" he said.The officer added, “Vijay along with his friends, was coming from Gurgaon and heading to Rangpuri.” Police will be issuing a notice to the owner of the vehicle.Vijay is unemployed and dependent on his father’s rental income business. His family owns multiple godowns across southwest Delhi.","Rajiv Kumar, 35, suffered around 10 fractures and other injuries.

"Flight delays and cancellations at Newark airport, second time in less than 7 days: Status update and what's hurting one of the busiest airports in the US",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/flight-delays-and-cancellations-at-newark-airport-second-time-in-less-than-7-days-status-update-and-whats-hurting-one-of-the-busiest-airports-in-the-us/articleshow/120918904.cms,"Representative Image

Flight delays and cancellations reportedly continued to plague Newark Liberty International Airport on Monday, May 5, 2025, as the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) cited air traffic controller absences and persistent cloud cover as key factors. The disruptions, which have drawn national attention, prompted Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, as reported by AP, to call for an inspector general investigation into what he described as ""chaos"" at the airport.The FAA reported that some air traffic controllers, stressed by recent equipment and telecommunications outages, took time off to recover, exacerbating delays that reached nearly four hours for arriving flights. United Airlines , a major carrier at Newark, slashed 35 daily flights from its schedule starting Saturday, citing an outdated air traffic control system and staffing shortages. United CEO Scott Kirby noted that over one-fifth of Newark’s controllers had ""walked off the job"" following multiple technology failures in recent days.Schumer, a New York Democrat, urged the Transportation Department to investigate the root causes of the disruptions to prevent further escalation. New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy echoed the frustration, calling the delays “completely and utterly unacceptable” in a post on X. Murphy added that U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy is committed to hiring more controllers to address the shortage.The Trump administration has acknowledged the need to modernize the ""obsolete"" air traffic control system and bolster the controller workforce. Last week, Duffy announced a recruitment program and incentives to retain existing controllers. However, the National Air Traffic Controllers Association emphasized that the system remains in dire need of technological and infrastructural upgrades.The disruptions come at a challenging time for the airline industry, with United Airlines offering dual financial forecasts—one anticipating a potential recession driven by President Donald Trump ’s trade policies. United operates flights to 76 U.S. cities and 81 international destinations from Newark, making the airport a critical hub.The FAA and the Transportation Department did not immediately respond to AP requests for comment. As delays persist, travelers are left grappling with uncertainty, and pressure mounts for systemic reforms to stabilize operations at one of the nation’s busiest airports.","FAA reports that some air traffic controllers, stressed by recent equipment and telecommunications outages, took time off to recover.

BFI funding halted by sports ministry amid election row,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/boxing/bfi-funding-halted-by-sports-ministry-amid-election-row/articleshow/120918829.cms,"Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel.

NEW DELHI: The sports ministry has initiated action against the Boxing Federation of India (BFI) for its inability to conduct its elections within the stipulated time frame. TOI has learnt that the ministry recently halted its funding to the federation, which was previously allocated for organising national camps and domestic championships.In a recent step, the funds were instead directly provided to the Sports Authority of India (SAI)-run NIS Patiala , where the country’s boxers are currently stationed. Under the ministry’s ‘Scheme of Assistance to NSFs’, it acts as the main financier for NSFs. On this occasion, rather than disbursing the funds to BFI, the ministry directed the NIS management to utilise the money for the smooth running of the coaching camp and to arrange an appropriate diet for the pugilists. “We don’t want the boxers and coaches to suffer in this federation’s stand-off.The BFI’s office-bearers are busy fighting each other in different courts of the country, looking to seize control of the federation. The BFI needs to hold its elections at the earliest…the ministry is clear about it,” a ministry source said.This action by the ministry comes as a result of the federation’s continued postponement of elections, which have been due since Feb 2 this year. The BFI, at present, is governed by a sixmember committee appointed by World Boxing (WB), with current president Ajay Singh acting as its chairman. Singh, who is pursuing a third term at the helm of the federation, has abstained from holding the elections amid concerns that the majority of state member associations may not support him.Previously, the returning officer (RO) appointed by the Singh-led BFI, former Delhi high court judge R K Gauba, stepped down from his position, citing an “unhealthy and uncalled for smear campaign” against him by various factions within the federation. The committee formed by the sport’s global governing body has been given a 90-day mandate to function, though there is no set timeline for electing new office-bearers for the term 2025-2029.The elections were rescheduled for March 28 on Himachal high court’s order but have since been postponed indefinitely.","The sports ministry has initiated action against the Boxing Federation of India.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","As job cuts continue to rise in various industries, some employees are going for 'career cushioning' Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child.

Delhi Results 2025: 'LinkedIn Lessons' from Brand BJP's win and Brand AAP's loss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-results-2025-linkedin-lessons-from-brand-bjps-win-and-brand-aaps-loss/articleshow/118066797.cms,"AAP: From Disruptor to Establishment to Decline



AAP was the ultimate political startup—the kind that raises Series A, B, and C funding at record speed, becomes a unicorn, and then implodes under its own weight. It was supposed to be the alternative to traditional politics, the fresh face in a crowded market, a party that rejected caste, religion, and dynasty-driven politics.

But somewhere along the way, it stopped being a startup and started behaving like an old-school corporate giant—bloated, bureaucratic, and overconfident.

1) From Lean & Agile to Bureaucratic & Slow

AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach—the political equivalent of a D2C brand shaking up a legacy market.

Over time, it became centralized and top-heavy, with decision-making confined to a handful of leaders. MLAs became inaccessible, the leadership became distant, and ground-level mobilization weakened. No succession planning. Kejriwal remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force.

remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force. The result? Voters saw it as just another party, not the disruptor it once was.

2) A Reputation Built on Ethics, Lost to Scandals

AAP built its brand on fighting corruption—but its own leadership got embroiled in one of the biggest scandals of its time, the liquor policy scam.

Manish Sisodia, Sanjay Singh, and even Kejriwal himself faced corruption allegations, undoing years of anti-corruption positioning.

The Sheesh Mahal controversy—where Kejriwal’s residence was allegedly renovated with ₹45 crore of taxpayer money—completely shattered the “humble leader” narrative.

AAP’s response? Defensive, aggressive, and dismissive. Instead of damage control, it doubled down on denial—a classic PR blunder.

The perception shift was swift and brutal—from “anti-corruption warriors” to just another power-hungry political entity.

3) Ignoring the Middle-Class Voter That Built Its Base

AAP was originally the party of the middle class—frustrated taxpayers who wanted clean governance and economic relief.

Over time, its focus shifted to freebies and populist policies, leaving the middle class feeling ignored.

BJP stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters.

stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters. Kejriwal’s pre-election outreach to the middle class felt forced and last-minute—while BJP had already solidified its positioning.

Takeaway ? A business (or party) that forgets its core customer will eventually lose them.

4) Blaming External Factors Instead of Owning Failures

For 10 years, AAP blamed the Centre, the LG, and opposition parties for everything.

The “victim card” was effective in the early years but wore thin by 2025—voters expected governance, not excuses.

BJP flipped this weakness into an advantage, promising that with a BJP-led government, there would be no Centre-state conflicts, leading to “seamless governance.”

The narrative changed from “AAP vs. BJP” to “AAP vs. Results.” Lesson? Leaders who constantly shift blame instead of delivering solutions lose credibility.

5) Strategic Missteps and Lack of Political Alliances

AAP contested separately from Congress, which led to a split in the anti-BJP vote.

Rahul Gandhi’s direct attacks on Kejriwal made matters worse—AAP was getting hit from both sides.

Internal conflicts weakened the party further. Atishi and Saurabh Bharadwaj were seen as Kejriwal’s successors, but there was no clear transition strategy.

BJP: A Masterclass in Strategic Adaptation

BJP’s 2025 win in Delhi was not a Modi-centric sweep but a well-calibrated organizational comeback. After a lackluster 2024 Lok Sabha performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader.

performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader. Unlike AAP, BJP adapted, restructured, and executed flawlessly.

1) Moving Beyond Modi Dependency

BJP understood that Delhi’s electorate needed a more localized approach.

Instead of making the election about Modi, it focused on governance, urban issues, and direct voter engagement.

No CM face? It didn’t matter. The party projected collective leadership instead of relying on one individual.

By decentralizing its campaign, BJP looked more stable and future-ready.

2) Adopting AAP’s Own Strategies Against It

BJP neutralized AAP’s welfare advantage—promising free electricity, continued subsidies, and additional financial support for women.

Middle-class tax reliefs were announced just before the elections, ensuring they won over voters that AAP had neglected.

The manifesto focused on real urban issues—pollution control, traffic congestion, and infrastructure—exactly what AAP had failed to address convincingly.

Lesson? The best way to beat a competitor is to adopt their strengths while exposing their weaknesses.

3) Letting Congress Do The Attacking



BJP didn’t need to attack AAP aggressively—Rahul Gandhi and Congress did that for them.

By letting AAP and Congress fight it out, BJP consolidated its voter base while the opposition split.

AAP’s credibility suffered more because the attacks came from within the anti-BJP camp.

A strategic win, without unnecessary effort.

4) A Disciplined, Focused, and Well-Executed Campaign

BJP stayed on message, focusing on corruption, governance, and economic stability.

The campaign was structured and well-planned, unlike AAP’s which seemed reactive and disorganized.

The promise to investigate AAP’s corruption cases resonated with voters, reinforcing BJP’s stance on accountability.

In business terms? BJP had a clear marketing strategy, strong brand positioning, and flawless execution.

5) Final Takeaways

Adaptability is key. BJP recalibrated after its 2024 Lok Sabha setbacks, while AAP remained stagnant.

Brand trust is fragile. AAP built its image on honesty but lost credibility due to scandals and mismanagement.

Execution matters more than rhetoric. BJP delivered a disciplined, well-structured campaign.

Leadership succession planning is critical. AAP failed to build second-line leadership, while BJP showcased organizational depth.

Voters reward governance, not excuses. After a decade in power, AAP’s blame game no longer worked.

Politics, like business, rewards those who adapt, execute, and deliver.

Ah, another election, another flood of LinkedIn wisdom posts—where every poll result is a ""case study,"" every political leader is a ""CEO,"" and every campaign is an ""MBA-level lesson in leadership."" Some call it democracy, but on LinkedIn, it’s all about business jargon and corporate analogies.So, let’s break this down the LinkedIn way.BJP, on the other hand, had a structured, disciplined campaign with clear messaging and no internal rifts. In politics and business, a divided team rarely wins.","AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach.

Ten years of incumbency

Liquor scam, Sheesh Mahal dent Kejriwal's 'imandaar' image

No tie-up, Congress did strategic campaigning

Flood of freebies but no next-level of development

BJP focuses on Kejriwal, Hindutva takes back seat

BJP's latent vote

Rahul roasted Kejriwal as payback for Haryana

MCD with AAP: No excuses

Steady exodus of AAP leaders

AAP goes negative

The BJP on Saturday pulled off a major political upset by unseating the Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ) from Delhi after over 10 years. As per the latest Election Commission data, the BJP may win around 48 seats and the Kejriwal-led party may secure around 22 seats in the 70-seat Assembly.BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in a fierce contest from the New Delhi seat by a margin of 4,089 votes. Verma, 47, bagged 30,088 votes, while Kejriwal and Congress' Sandeep Dikshit got 25,999 votes and 4,568 votes.Kejriwal conceded his defeat and hoped that the BJP will fulfill all its promises.""We accept the mandate of the people with great humility. I congratulate the BJP for this victory and I hope they will fulfil all the promises for which people have voted for them,"" Kejriwal said in a video address posted on X.In the evening as the results were decalred, PM Modi kicked off his victory speech with a powerful chant of ""Yamuna Maiya ki Jai"". PM Modi declared that the people of Delhi were experiencing both relief and joy -- relief from the ""disaster"" (AAP-da governance) and joy in embracing a new era under BJP rule. ""I had written a letter to every Delhi resident, urging them to give the BJP a chance to serve in the 21st century...Today, I bow my head in gratitude to every family in Delhi for trusting us. You have given us love with an open heart, and I assure you that we will return it manifold through rapid development,"" PM Modi said.The Prime Minister also attacked the AAP over allegations of corruption against its leaders, saying that all links of such charges will be probed and those who ""looted"" money will have to return it.With the BJP set to regain control of Delhi after 27 years, what went wrong for the Aam Aadmi Party?After governing Delhi for a decade, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) faced significant anti-incumbency.While AAP achieved impressive results in health and education during its first two terms, and kept voters happy with power and water subsidies, unfulfilled promises, such as improved air quality, became major poll issues.The AAP's assertion that the BJP government at the Centre was creating roadblocks in its functioning began to be increasingly seen by voters as excuses, especially after ten years in power.The BJP's ""double engine"" promise, suggesting seamless governance between the central and state levels, appealed to voters against the backdrop of AAP's constant conflicts with the Centre. Furthermore, internal disarray within the AAP, with senior leaders facing jail time, added to the challenges of incumbency .The image of Arvind Kejriwal as an anti-corruption crusader suffered a setback due to several factors, most notably the controversy surrounding the now-scrapped liquor policy.The BJP accused the AAP government of turning Delhi into a ""city of drunkards"" with the new policy, and receiving crores in kickbacks from those who opened the vends.Probes by central agencies led to the arrest of top AAP leaders, including Arvind Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia, and Sanjay Singh. These arrests forced Sisodia to step down as deputy chief minister and kept the AAP in ""firefighting mode"", distracting from fulfilling its 2020 poll promises.Additionally, the ""Sheesh Mahal"" controversy, referring to the renovated residence of the chief minister, further dented Kejriwal's image. The BJP further highlighted a Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) report that indicated the renovation cost had increased from an initial estimate of Rs 7.91 crore to Rs 33.66 crore by completion.AAP has been synonymous with Arvind Kejriwal since its inception. Kejriwal, initially seen as an agent of change with his untucked shirt and no-nonsense demeanor, resonated with the common person.However, the anti-corruption image of Kejriwal and his party suffered irreparable damage, specially after the AAP leader's arrest in March 2024 on corruption allegations and his subsequent resignation as CM.While he was later granted bail, the leadership transition to Atishi and the circumstances surrounding Kejriwal's arrest damaged the party's image and cohesion.The absence of an alliance with the Congress party and the Congress's strategic campaigning likely contributed to the AAP's loss.In previous elections, the AAP had significantly reduced the Congress's presence in the Delhi assembly.Attempts to convince Congress workers to collaborate with AAP volunteers reportedly led to an ""existential crisis"" among them.The Congress decided to campaign aggressively against the AAP, sensing ""anger building up against the AAP"". Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra attacked the AAP in the final days of the Delhi campaign.The Congress further claimed the AAP did not want an alliance, with Kejriwal announcing all 70 candidates early on.The rise of AAP in Delhi has been congruous with the decline of the Congress. In 2013, AAP won 28 seats with a 29.49% vote share, while the Congress tally decreased to 8 seats from 43 in 2008. In 2015, Congress suffered a 15% decline in its vote share, while the AAP saw its support base rise by around 15%.While AAP's welfare schemes, such as free electricity and bus travel for women, initially garnered support, a lack of focus on infrastructure development and maintenance became a significant issue.The poor condition of roads and sewers across Delhi angered voters.Overflowing drains, potholed roads, and irregular garbage collection contributed to the party's unpopularity.The AAP's control over the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) meant it could not deflect blame for these issues onto the BJP. Voters in middle- and upper-middle-class areas were particularly affected by the deteriorating infrastructure.AAP's origins trace back to Anna Hazare’s anti-corruption movement, positioning the party as an alternative to the Congress in 2013.While AAP secured mandates in 2015 and 2020, their repeated promises and ""freebies"" seem to have lost their appeal.The promise of piped water connections for all in 2015 remains unfulfilled, as does the promise of full statehood for Delhi and the ""Rozgar Budget"" aimed at creating 20 lakh jobs.Kejriwal himself admitted that he had failed to fulfill three promises: cleaning the Yamuna, providing clean drinking water, and upgrading Delhi's roads. This acknowledgment gave the BJP an opportunity to attack the AAP, with Amit Shah mocking Kejriwal's promise to purify the Yamuna.The BJP's campaign strategy focused primarily on targeting Arvind Kejriwal and his government, rather than emphasising Hindutva, as it has often done during campainging in other state elections as well as previous Delhi polls.This approach likely resonated with a broader segment of the population, including those who may not have been inclined to support a religiously charged campaign. By focusing on issues such as corruption and governance, the BJP effectively undermined AAP's credibility and appealed to a wider range of voters.The BJP also focused on hyper-local issues such as air pollution, traffic, and public safety, and engaged with local Resident Welfare Associations. They also promoted central government schemes.The BJP also targeted specific demographics, including Purvanchalis and slum dwellers, and utilised an aggressive digital campaign with AI-enhanced content and memes targeting AAP.The BJP's consistent performance in the Lok Sabha polls in Delhi indicated a latent voter base that the party successfully mobilised this time around for the assembly elections.Despite AAP's strong performance in the assembly elections, the BJP had consistently swept Lok Sabha elections in the national capital, winning all seven seats.This pre-existing support base provided a foundation for the BJP's campaign and likely contributed to their victory.The BJP also strategically fielded Parvesh Verma, a strong Jat leader, in the New Delhi constituency, signaling their intention to win back the confidence of the Jat community, which had previously favoured AAP in Delhi elections.During the Delhi Assembly elections, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi launched strong criticisms against Arvind Kejriwal, which may have been payback for events in Haryana. Gandhi's attacks covered a range of issues, including alleged corruption, unfulfilled promises, and inaction on key issues.Like the BJP, Gandhi attacked Kejriwal over the alleged liquor scam and accused him of living in a ""Sheesh Mahal"" while engaging in corrupt practices.Gandhi said that Kejriwal made false promises, ""similar to Prime Minister Narendra Modi"", particularly regarding cleaning the Yamuna River. He also challenged Kejriwal to drink Delhi's tap water, implying it was still polluted despite promises to clean it.The Aam Aadmi Party's (AAP) win in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) in 2022 proved to be a double-edged sword, ultimately hurting the party instead of helping it. AAP had promised a cleaner city with world-class roads, but it fell short on both accounts. The MCD House was in limbo, and the Standing Committee, which controls all financial powers, was never formed. The AAP repeatedly accused the Centre of creating hurdles through the Lieutenant Governor and stalling projects.This time around, voters held the AAP accountable for the deteriorating civic infrastructure across Delhi.AAP's performance in the MCD was a letdown for the people of Delhi. The party failed to address critical issues such as clearing garbage, repairing roads, and cleaning clogged sewers. Erratic water supply and overflowing sewers that were never repaired because Rs 4,000 crore for the Delhi Jal Board was not released further hurt the party.Senior party leaders stated that the MCD functioning had collapsed under the AAP, and no work was being done, leading to frustration among councillors.The steady departure of senior leaders from AAP over time might have also weakened the party's organisational structure and public image.The exit of prominent figures like Prashant Bhushan, Yogendra Yadav, Mayank Gandhi, and Kumar Vishwas, who had dared to disagree with Arvind Kejriwal, and repeatedly accused Kejriwal of having an ""autocratic"" style of leadership.Resignation of senior leaders like Kailash Gahlot, who cited the party's focus on political agenda over fulfilling promises, along with internal challenges, signalled internal discord.The BJP had termed Gahlot's resignation a ""courageous move"".Negative campaigning by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) centered on issues like Yamuna River pollution, the Delhi Police, and the Election Commission (EC) may have affected public perception of the AAP government.In the lead up to the polls, Kejriwal accused the BJP-led Haryana government of poisoning the Yamuna River, which supplies drinking water to Delhi. He claimed that the Haryana government deliberately sent polluted waters to Delhi to create an artificial water scarcity and blame the AAP.The AAP also repeatedly levelled accusations of voter fraud and irregularities against the BJP as well as the EC.AAP alleged that the Election Commission and Delhi Police were shielding BJP workers and accused them of ""hooliganism"". Kejriwal wrote to the Chief Election Commissioner, expressing concern over the intimidation and harassment of AAP volunteers by BJP workers. The EC responded that no written complaints could be traced in most cases but assured that all registered complaints are investigated.Kejriwal further criticised the Election Commission for allegedly refusing to make Form 17C public, a document detailing the number of votes polled at each booth. AAP then launched a website, transparentelections.in, claiming to upload Form 17C data for all constituencies to present the data in an accessible format.The EC dismissed Kejriwal's claims regarding Form 17C, stating that copies had already been provided to polling agents at each booth after voting, as per Rule 49S of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961.","BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal.

Designers do a double take at the lettering on Pope Francis' tombstone,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/designers-do-a-double-take-at-the-lettering-on-pope-francis-tombstone/articleshow/120914756.cms,"



The arrangements for the funeral of Pope Francis were meticulous, and the ceremony drew a global audience. But it is the arrangement of the letters on his tombstone that are now attracting outsize attention. The simple slab has only 10 letters, but the spacing between them can make it read like ""F R A NCISC VS.""The lettering is meant to be read as Franciscus, the derivative of the pope's name in Latin. (V stood for both u and v in Latin.) Pope Francis' marble tomb fulfills his desire for an unadorned final resting place. In that sense, the tombstone lettering in Times Roman, a workmanlike font widely used in the English, could be considered appropriate. But for those who obsess about kerning, the space between letters, the view from above the tomb is not exactly an aesthetically pleasing one.""Woe be unto the person who decided to do it the way that they did it, just because it's a bad decision that will last for a long time, unless they change it,"" said Charles Nix of Monotype, one of world's largest typeface and technology companies. The double take for some when they look at the letters is caused by the lack of kerning between pairs of letters.So what happened at the Vatican? ""It may have been laid out as individual letters, and not actually typed,"" Nix said, adding for centuries, people have tried to figure out a mathematical way to engrave letters, and it always fails.A representative of Vatican could not immediately be reached for comment about the lettering. A lack of kerning is common on grave markers, Nix said, especially those from the 20th century onward because they are produced very mathematically. An editor at Fast Company magazine was among the first to notice the discordance. Other more casual observers pointed to the ""A"" in Franciscus standing apart from other letters. ""Why does it look like pressing on the letter 'A' will open a secret chamber where the ark of the covenant is stored?"" asked Elle Cordova, a digital creator. ""Pope's name was just cranked out by someone operating a stonecutting machine, probably via sandblasting from a template prepared on a computer,"" said Paul Shaw, a type and design historian.Evan Sult, an art director and designer, wrote: ""We all recognise there are far more fundamentally significant aspects of lived life than how text is presented, the life and legacy of the Pope being perhaps one of the ultimate examples. Which makes it all the more incredible when the moment arrives where the typography plays its key role in the symphony of shared experience ... and utterly blows the note.""","The lettering on Pope Francis' tombstone is attracting outsize attention.

Pak Defence Minister Threatens To Strike Indian Water Projects, BJP Hits Back Strongly

Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif has threatened that his country will target any structure built by India on the Indus River if it goes against the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), which New Delhi recently suspended after the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack Speaking on a programme of Pakistan News channelon Friday, Asif said, ""Certainly, if they (India) attempt to build any kind of structure, we will strike it.""He said that any construction on the Indus River would be seen as ""Indian aggression"" towards Pakistan.""Aggression is not just about firing cannons or bullets; it has many faces. One of those faces is [blocking or diverting water], which could lead to deaths due to hunger and thirst,"" he added.Asif also said, ""If they make any architectural attempt, then Pakistan will destroy that structure.""But for now, we are heading to forums available to us, starting from the IWT [Indus Waters Treaty]. We will pursue this matter.""This comes days after Asif said that the chances of conflict with India were increasing with the passage of time despite efforts by different countries to defuse the tensions between the two neighbours.""Chances (of conflict) are increasing with the passage of time; they are not decreasing.

No, other areas are more important Yes, it's crucial

NEW DELHI: If a war between India and Pakistan breaks out, it may only last for four days due to Pakistan's ""dangerously low"" stockpiles of artillery ammunition, news agency ANI reported citing sources.Pakistan ordnance factories are struggling to replenish supplies amid surging global demand and outdated production facilities. Additionally, recent arms deals with Ukraine have also drained Pakistan's war reserves.According to sources, Pakistan's ammunition reserves can sustain only 96 hours of high-intensity conflict.Pakistan's military doctrine, which focuses on swift deployment to address India's larger forces, depends heavily on artillery and armoured divisions. The army's defensive capabilities are significantly reduced without adequate 155mm shells for M109 howitzers or 122mm rockets for BM-21 systems.According to ANI, social media posts on X in April 2025 indicated that essential 155mm artillery ammunition , crucial for Pakistan's artillery-focused strategy, was sent to Ukraine, resulting in critically low reserves.The transfer of 155mm ammunition to Ukraine has left all corresponding artillery systems, including self-propelled and MGS units, with insufficient ammunition stocks.The ammunition deficit significantly affects Pakistan's military preparedness, which depends substantially on artillery and armoured units. The shortage severely impacts the army's capacity to resist offensive from India.Reports indicate that the Pakistani Military leadership is seriously worried, bordering on anxiety. This matter was addressed during the Special Corps Commanders Conference on May 2, 2025, alongside other issues.Earlier, former Army Chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa had noted these constraints, indicating Pakistan's insufficient ammunition and economic capacity for sustained conflict with India.Pakistan has established ammunition storage facilities near the India-Pakistan border in preparation for possible hostilities, sources told ANI.Pakistan's decision to export ammunition has left its defence capabilities significantly weakened, with depleted stockpiles potentially compromising its security in future conflicts.Pakistan's financial difficulties, including high inflation, increasing debt, and reduced foreign currency reserves, have affected military operations. The army has reduced food supplies, stopped military drills, and cancelled war games due to fuel limitations.Additionally, Pakistan faces embarrassment as its supported hacker groups ""Cyber Group HOAX1337"" and ""National Cyber Crew"" failed to compromise Indian websites on May 1.

Bangladesh Currency Crisis: Bangladesh faces currency crisis as central bank halts issuing notes featuring Mujibur Rahman,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladesh-faces-currency-crisis-as-central-bank-halts-issuing-notes-featuring-mujibur-rahman/articleshow/120714882.cms,"Approximately Taka 15,000 crore worth of notes remain unused

DHAKA: The central bank of Bangladesh has apparently incurred a huge financial loss due to the interim govt’s decision not to issue previously printed notes, with approximately Taka 15,000 crore worth of paper notes featuring the image of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman remaining unused. The decision aligns with govt’s efforts to diminish Bangabandhu’s presence in public memory.Although bank officials are unwilling to discuss the matter publicly, many, on conditions of anonymity, said the longstanding tradition of obtaining new notes from Bangladesh Bank has been abruptly halted, creating a crisis in the market. On the one hand, the printed money is being wasted without use; on the other hand, customers are suffering as a result, they added.“Notes of various denominations are printed using paper and ink purchased with people’s taxes. Millions of notes with Bangabandhu’s picture are still lying in the vaults of various banks. The Security Printing Corporation does not have the capacity to cancel all the notes at once and print new ones. Therefore, notes with Bangabandhu’s picture cann’t be suddenly cancelled,” Ziauddin Ahmed, former executive director of Bangladesh Bank and former managing director of Security Printing Corporation, told reporters.In this situation, he suggested the printed notes be circulated in the market to alleviate public suffering. “When new design notes come into the market, the old ones should be gradually withdrawn. Generally, notes printed once can be used for a maximum of four to five years,” Ahmed said.According to media reports, Bangladesh Bank is unable to issue new notes to banks in line with demand. The crisis became evident following the country’s political upheaval in Aug last year.Since all forms of currency, including metal coins, feature Mujibur’s image, Bangladesh Bank abruptly stopped issuing new notes early April. As a result, the notes featuring Bangabandhu’s image are not reaching the market. Shops, banks, and citizens are now left with torn and old, dirty notes.According to sources at Bangladesh Bank, the Security Printing Corporation is set to begin printing new design notes next month. In the first phase, new design notes of 20, 50, and 1,000 taka will be printed and subsequently released in the market through banks.","Taka 15,000 crore worth of paper notes featuring the image of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman remain unused.

UK MPs demand release of jailed British Sikh facing terror charges in India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-mps-demand-release-of-jailed-british-sikh-facing-terror-charges-in-india/articleshow/120879025.cms,"UK MPs demand release of jailed British Sikh facing terror charges in India

TOI Correspondent from London:

More than 100 UK MPs and peers have signed a letter urging foreign secretary David Lammy to take “quick and decisive” diplomatic action to secure the release of Jagtar Singh Johal , a British Sikh jailed in India since 2017 on terrorism charges.Johal, also known as Jaggi, is lodged in New Delhi’s Tihar jail and denies all allegations, including terrorism, murder of political and religious figures, and ties to Khalistan Liberation Force. Johal, in his late 30s, is accused of funding terrorist activities and conspiracy, but not direct involvement in the alleged crimes.His MP Douglas McAllister led the letter to Lammy, saying Johal was acquitted on March 4, 2025, in one of nine cases at Moga district court in Punjab due to “no credible evidence”. The letter says since the same evidence underpins the other eight cases — now under NIA — they too should be dropped.Supreme Court last week declined to rule on Johal’s seven pending bail applications and gave no timeframe for resolution.Calling his detention “arbitrary,” the letter claims Johal was tortured and “forced to give a confessional statement”. The British lawmakers urged Lammy to press Indian officials for Johal’s release on bail, pending case discontinuation.Lammy is scheduled to meet Johal’s brother Gurpreet Singh Johal on May 8. “Indian authorities will keep him in prison for decades if UK govt doesn’t act,” Gurpreet said.UK govt has raised concerns with India, including allegations of torture and mistreatment, though activists say the response has been insufficient. “For him to remain imprisoned for decades, as duplicate trials drag on in defiance of the principle of double jeopardy, would be an obscene injustice,” said Dan Dolan, interim deputy executive director at Reprieve US, a human rights organisation.","Johal, also known as Jaggi, is lodged in New Delhi’s Tihar jail and denies all allegations.

Top Spanish court drops tax complaint against ex-king Juan Carlos,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/top-spanish-court-drops-tax-complaint-against-ex-king-juan-carlos/articleshow/120903097.cms,"Top Spanish court drops tax complaint against ex-king Juan Carlos





Spain's Supreme Court said on Monday it had shelved a complaint lodged by a group of retired judges and other leading figures against disgraced former king Juan Carlos for alleged tax offences.Spanish prosecutors in March 2022 closed three probes into his finances due to insufficient evidence and the statute of limitations, but said several irregularities had been found.Among them were lucrative gifts from Gulf Arab monarchies and private trips funded by a foundation based in the tiny European state of Liechtenstein.In response, a group of former judges, legal experts, philosophers and journalists in November 2024 sued Juan Carlos for alleged tax offences, arguing a court rather than public prosecutors must decide if he fulfilled his tax obligations.But the Supreme Court dismissed the lawsuit, arguing it ""does not provide any new facts, evidence or documents that would justify reopening the investigation"" into the former head of state's finances.Juan Carlos, 87, made two payments worth more than five million euros to the Spanish tax authorities to settle money owed on past undeclared income, a move widely viewed as a bid to avoid charges.He enjoyed widespread admiration for his role in Spain's transition to democracy following the death of longtime dictator Francisco Franco in 1975.But the revelations about the murky origins of his fortune since his abdication in 2014 have done irreparable damage to his reputation and harmed the Spanish monarchy.He went into self-imposed exile in the United Arab Emirates in 2020 but has returned to Spain periodically since 2022 to take part in sailing regattas in the northwestern region of Galicia.",Top Spanish court drops tax complaint against ex-king Juan Carlos.
