"Iran-Israel war: Iran airspace shut, international flights from India to take longer",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/iran-israel-war-iran-airspace-shut-international-flights-from-india-to-take-longer/articleshow/121839437.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Flights between the West and India, mainly Delhi and Mumbai, will get even longer following the Iranian airspace closure on Friday after Israel attacked the country's nuclear sites. Sixteen Air India (AI) flights were impacted Friday, with the majority diverting and the others returning to origin.AI had resumed overflying Iran shortly after Pakistan had closed its airspace to Indian carriers on April 24 to partially mitigate the longer route its flights had to take since then. While AI will have to take longer routes to and from the West, IndiGo between Delhi and Tbilisi and Delhi and Baku will become one-stop flights now. With both Pakistan and Iran no-go areas, Indian carriers will have to take really longer routes to reach Central Asia. ""We are studying the situation and some AI flights may become one-stop after closure of Iran airspace,"" said sources.Also, if and when Iran retaliates, the airspace of countries near Israel, like Jordan and Lebanon, also be impacted. This has in the past forced airlines to take longer detours in that area whenever conflict escalates.""Due to the emerging situation in Iran, subsequent closure of its airspace, and in view of safety of our passengers, (some) Air India flights are either being diverted or returning to their origin. We regret the inconvenience caused to our passengers due to this unforeseen disruption and are making every effort to minimise it, including providing accommodation for passengers,"" Air India said Friday. ""Refund on cancellation or complimentary rescheduling is also being offered to guests who opt for it. Alternative arrangements are being made to fly passengers to their destinations. We advise passengers to check their flight status,"" AI added.Air India flights impacted Friday were AI-130 (London Heathrow-Mumbai), diverted to Vienna; AI-102 (New York-Delhi), diverted to Sharjah; AI-116 (New York-Mumbai), diverted to Jeddah; AI-2018 (London Heathrow-Delhi), diverted to Mumbai; AI-129 (Mumbai-London Heathrow), returned to Mumbai; AI-119 (Mumbai-New York), returned to Mumbai; AI-103 (Delhi-Washington), returned to Delhi; AI-106 (Newark-Delhi), diverted to Vienna; AI-188 (Vancouver-Delhi), diverted to Jeddah; AI-101 (Delhi-New York), diverted to Frankfurt/Milan; and AI-126 (Chicago-Delhi), diverted to Jeddah.Also impacted were AI-132 (London Heathrow-Bengaluru), diverted to Sharjah; AI-2016 (London Heathrow-Delhi), diverted to Vienna; AI-104 (Washington-Delhi), diverted to Vienna; AI-190 (Toronto-Delhi), diverted to Frankfurt; and AI-189 (Delhi-Toronto), returned to Delhi.","Sixteen Air India flights were impacted Friday, with the majority diverting and the others returning to origin.

Wayne Gretzky’s fortune and assets are shaping Paulina’s multi-million dollar legacy

The Steinway powerboat is more than just a toy—it’s a Gretzky family heirloom in the making





As Dustin Johnson pursues another shot at U.S. Open glory, attention has shifted to his wife, Paulina Gretzky—not just for her support, but because of what she stands to inherit from her legendary father, the Great One, Wayne Gretzky. While Johnson has secured massive paydays from both the PGA Tour and LIV Golf, Paulina’s future is lined with generational wealth thanks to her father's illustrious career and lavish lifestyle.Wayne Gretzky, often referred to as “The Great One,” is more than just a hockey legend—he’s a financial powerhouse. With an estimated net worth of $250 million, Gretzky holds 61 NHL records and has turned his post-retirement years into a business empire. For Paulina, this means inheriting not only an enormous fortune but also a portfolio of jaw-dropping properties and luxury items.Among his holdings, Gretzky owns a lakefront estate in Idaho, multiple Florida homes, and a childhood residence in Brantford, Ontario. He even repurchased his famed ‘Gretzky Mansion’ in Thousand Oaks, California, only to flip it for a profit in 2021.But one of the most unique pieces in Wayne Gretzky's collection isn’t a home—it’s a custom, handcrafted 34-foot Steinway 340 HT powerboat.Commissioned in 2021, this bespoke mahogany boat—built by Couer Custom—is worth $900,000 and blends elegance with engineering. It can hit speeds of 50 mph but is designed for leisure. “I was relatively fast when I skated, but these days I drive my car slow,” Gretzky told Robb Report. “I'll take comfort over speed any day.”The boat features plush loungers, a main cockpit with cozy sofas, a stern sunpad, and even an electric bimini for added shade. Paulina’s mother, Janet Jones, played a pivotal role in designing its stylish aesthetic. “She’s the creative one in the family; the only thing I asked for was to have a Canadian flag at the back,” Gretzky added.Also Read: Wayne Gretzky sparks controversy by accusing Florida Panthers of buying success with tax loopholes Between her father’s sprawling real estate, massive fortune, and luxurious custom yacht, Paulina Gretzky’s future looks every bit as glamorous as her past—and Dustin Johnson may not be the biggest star in the household for much longer.","Paulina Gretzky stands to inherit millions from her father, hockey legend Wayne Gretzki.

Indian-origin businessman Sabeer Bhatia made comments on Air India crash that X users found insensitive.





Indian-origin businessman Sabeer Bhatia who recently mocked the Indian economy, mocked people mourning over the Air India crash in Ahmedabad and said it was an ""outpouring of fake emotions"". In a series of X posts all of which have gone viral, Bhatia asked for accountability of the crash and defended his words which social media users calls insensitive at the time of grieving.""Do you really think the 4th largest economy in the world should still be having plane crashes due to systemic failures? Time to question what truly makes a nation great,"" Bhatia posted.Social media users reminded him that there have been 55 deadly plane crashes in the US in 2025 alone to which Bhatia retorted that US has a greater number of flights as well.""Sabeer wants the attention he has lost. He wants to remind the world that he still exists,"" one wrote. ""Vulture spotted,"" another wrote. Interestingly, Bhatia engaged with all comments and even ran a poll on whether he should take an Air India flight or not.""Of course I’m deeply saddened and devastated by the loss of life.

Duration: 3 hours

What Google’s ‘mini incident report’ says on recent outage

Multiple Google Cloud and Google Workspace products experienced increased 503 errors in external API requests, impacting customers.

From our initial analysis, the issue occurred due to an invalid automated quota update to our API management system which was distributed globally, causing external API requests to be rejected. To recover we bypassed the offending quota check, which allowed recovery in most regions within 2 hours. However, the quota policy database in us-central1 became overloaded, resulting in much longer recovery in that region. Several products had moderate residual impact (e.g. backlogs) for up to an hour after the primary issue was mitigated and a small number recovering after that.

Google will complete a full Incident Report in the following days that will provide a detailed root cause.

Prevent our API management platform from failing due to invalid or corrupt data.

Prevent metadata from propagating globally without appropriate protection, testing and monitoring in place.

Improve system error handling and comprehensive testing for handling of invalid data.

That call never came. His final transmission was to air traffic control, moments before Air India Flight 171 went down.Captain Sabharwal had logged more than 8,200 hours in the cockpit, according to India’s aviation regulator DGCA. Colleagues believe his actual experience was far greater, noting that the DGCA’s current digital system may not fully reflect his career history.“He was a very quiet, diligent man,” said a fellow pilot. “He flew Airbus A310s, Boeing 777s and the Dreamliner.

GFCCA then demanded it be given a plot in the city's west, in areas like Satellite, Bodakdev, and Makarba. After AMC's estate department showed GFCCA several options, a 5,601 sq. m plot in Makarba's TP Scheme No. 84 (B) was finalised.AMC then valued both plots, its valuation committee putting the Asarwa plot's total value at Rs 43.72 crore at Rs 42,700 per sq m. The Makarba plot was valued at Rs 42.65 crore, at Rs 76,150 per sq m.It was decided to give GFCCA the Makarba plot in exchange for the Asarwa plot, with the fisheries association paying the difference of Rs 1.07 crore to AMC.This plot exchange proposal was presented before the standing committee in Oct 6, 2022, but has not been approved since. As a result, AMC provided temporary shops for the fish market in Asarwa, which still exists.An official stated, ""GFCCA was to set up the fish market in Asarwa with an estimated grant of Rs 2.90 crore from central and state govts, but the plan had been facing opposition from local leaders since 2019. The market was to be set up on a plot in Makarba, but the proposal for the plot swap was not approved. There has been no decision on the matter and currently the market runs from shops allocated by AMC in Asarwa.""The bane of pigeon racingLed by the then additional chief secretary of the state govt, a meeting of the environment committee was held on Oct 6, 2022, to prevent bird strikes at the airport. The most discussed issue was pigeon racing competitions near the city airport. Airport authorities had requested AMC to ban such competitions in the area, but the civic body purportedly washed its hands off the matter, saying it was not in its scope. Finally, it was decided that AMC and airport operators would conduct joint visits to gather information on pigeon competitions in areas around the airport. Such contests are held in areas around the airport including Asarwa, Sardarnagar, Kubernagar, and Meghaninagar.","Bird strike is suspected to be one of the probable reasons behind Thursday's plane crash.

These seats, with extra legroom, cost more, and are in demand following the miraculous escape of Viswashkumar Ramesh. The UK citizen was seated on 11A - a seat next to the emergency exit - and was the lone survivor of AI-171, the flight that crashed on Thursday.Seat numbers next to emergency exits vary according to types of aircraft and class configuration.Aviation experts said seats next to emergency exits may not afford any additional safety in case of a plane crash. All they offer is ample legroom. But for many, these seats now offer mental peace as well.Until Thursday, many flyers declined seats near emergency exits because some of them did not recline much. Moreover, some did not want to be briefed on how to open these exit doors in case of an emergency.Travel agents in Kolkata said while seasoned travellers and tall flyers often opted for these seats and did not mind paying a premium for legroom, others, too, have now started asking about those seats.Jitender Singh Bagga, who runs a distribution and logistics operations business, said he asked his travel agent to only book seats next to emergency exits when he travelled to the US via Delhi next week.""It has to be a seat next to the emergency exit. I am willing to fork out any extra amount for it. If seat 11A is next to the emergency door of the British Airways flight I intend to take on June 17, I want to be in it,"" said the Park Street resident.Lee Road resident Rajesh Bhagnani, a frequent flyer, also told his travel agent to book a seat next to the emergency exit for his travel to Mumbai on June 16. ""After watching Viswashkumar's great escape, I want to be seated next to the emergency exit as the possibility of survival will be higher than anywhere else. I know that life and death is a matter of destiny, but I still want to have my best shot. Nothing like seat no. 11A if there is an emergency exit next to it,"" he said.Anil Punjabi, national committee member of Travel Agents Federation of India, confirmed the rise in queries on seats next to the emergency exit. ""Some even want 11A even if it is not next to the exit,"" he said.Anjani Dhanuka, chairman of the eastern region chapter of Travel Agents Association of India, said he got queries from flyers looking for seats next to the emergency exit as well as 11A. ""It has got to do with mindset and belief in luck. The flyers say it is for their peace of mind,"" he said.","Seat numbers next to emergency exits vary according to types of aircraft and class configuration.

Tech fails to fill silence for the elderly,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/tech-fails-to-fill-silence-for-the-elderly/articleshow/121841874.cms,"NEW DELHI: Neelam Maini is 70 and did not own a mobile phone till she retired from a govt job in 2015. The smartphone came into her life as a gift from her children, who also became her mentors, introducing her to internet banking and the world of social media and WhatsApp.Ten years on, as vice-president of Sant Nagar Senior Citizens’ Welfare Association that has 400 members on a WhatsApp group, Maini has found that even as the mobile phone has opened a world of communication, helping bridge the generational digital divide, it has also created a deeper problem for many urban elderly people.With the younger generation mostly hooked to their devices — laptops and phones— and social media, more and more elderly people are feeling lonely as their children and grandchildren have little time for deeper engagement with them.This clearly comes through in a survey by HelpAge India released on Friday, ahead of World Elder Abuse Awareness Day on June 15. It reveals that a large number of senior citizens already struggling with loneliness and challenges of ageing now also have to contend with problems of the digital age.The survey, which focused on “intergenerational dynamics and perceptions on ageing”, draws on the experiences of 5,798 respondents that included youth and elderly people from 10 cities — Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad, Kanpur, Nagpur and Madurai.“Everyone is on the phone these days, even at the dining table, including elders. But parents feel hurt when they cannot have a meaningful conversation with children and grandchildren. At times, their family members have time to chat with them only on phone while on the way to work,”Maini told TOI , sharing this as one of the experiences of seniors, who yearn for face-to-face conversations with their kin.“Children don’t sit and talk anymore. They are always on their phones,” complained a senior citizen from Kolkata. “They don’t always listen, but when do they talk to us, it makes the day go better,” said an elderly person from Kanpur. “I just stay silent these days. If we speak, they say we’re complaining again,” bemoaned a senior from Madurai.The problem is not just inter-generational. “We used to gossip with friends in the past. Now we scroll silently. Even loneliness has gone digital,” said another senior from Kolkata.The findings gain significance against the backdrop of India’s population profile: as of 2025, approximately 12% of the Indian population is aged 60 and above, with the figure projected to rise to 19% by 2050. At the same time, India is home to the world’s largest youth population, with over 365 million individuals aged 15–29 years.","A survey by HelpAge India reveals that a large number of senior citizens already struggling with loneliness and challenges of ageing now also have to contend with problems of the digital age.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%.

The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Several ‘High-Risk Persons’ Under Lens For Not Complying With I-T Act Provisions

NEW DELHI:

.

The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has launched an investigation against several “high-risk persons” who were allegedly evading taxes and laundering unaccounted funds by investing them in cryptocurrency. These entities and individuals, who were identified for verification and scrutiny, were allegedly involved in Virtual Digital Asset (VDA) transactions and did not comply with the provisions of the Incometax Act, sources said.Three years ago, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman got parliamentary approval to amend the law to mandate a flat 30% tax, along with the applicable surcharge and cess, on income arising from VDA transfer. The law also bars the deduction of any expenses, except the cost of acquisition. Neither is the set-off of losses on these investments or trading allowed, nor is it permitted to carry forward the losses. The review of VDA returns pertains to 2022-23 and 2023-24.The income tax department’s data analysis has shown that a large number of persons violated provisions of the Income Tax Act by not filing the details of VDA in their returns, not paying tax on the income, or claiming cost indexation.CBDT has already sent emails to thousands of individuals, asking them to review their returns and update the income arising out of VDA transactions, sources said.The move is part of the recent “nudge” philosophy of the department, hoping that the emails will do the trick and action will be taken against only those who do not respond to the communication or do not correct their returns. While govt is yet to recognise cryptocurrency as an asset class, it decided to impose a flat 30% tax on VDAs, along with 1% tax deducted at source (TDS) on the sale consideration. This drew a lot of adverse comments from the crypto lobby, which stated that exchanges would shut down and trading would move out of the country and operate through illegal means.There has also been lobbying for recognising crypto as an asset, even as govt believes that there needs to be a global push for cross-border regulation. Govt is expected to issue the long-awaited consultation paper soon.","Several ‘High-Risk Persons’ Under Lens For Not Complying With I-T Act Provisions.

Fee Hikes: What’s Driving the Increase?

A Mixed Reaction from Parents

Khaleej Times

The Growing Need for Affordable Options

The Bigger Picture: Dubai’s Expanding Private School Sector





A wave of school fee hikes has been announced across Dubai, leaving parents to either adapt to the higher costs or consider alternative schooling options. While some families are grappling with increases of up to Dh5,000 annually for each child, others are managing more modest hikes of a few hundred dirhams. Despite the widespread rise in fees, many parents are exploring ways to cope, from paying annual fees in lump sums to researching more affordable institutions.In May 2025, Dubai’s Knowledge and Human Development Authority (KHDA) approved a 2.35% increase in the Education Cost Index (ECI) for private for-profit schools for the 2025-2026 academic year. This decision allows schools to adjust their fees based on individual school grades, as determined by the results of the Dubai School Inspection Bureau (DSIB) and the ECI. The change impacts families across Dubai, who have started receiving notifications about the fee increases.The adjustment is part of a broader effort to account for inflation, rising operational costs, and other financial pressures faced by schools. However, while some parents are facing steep increases, others are relieved by more manageable hikes.Many parents are already feeling the financial strain of the fee hikes. For example, Manal, a Dubai resident with children attending an Indian syllabus school in Al Quoz, shared that her family's total fee increase will amount to Dh400 per year for both of her children. “I am very glad that the increase is manageable and not a huge burden,” Manal said. “We had budgeted for an increase this year so we were not caught off-guard,”reported.In contrast, some families are facing much steeper hikes. Vivek, an Indian expat with two children enrolled in a premium school, revealed that his children’s school fees currently range from Dh87,000 to Dh92,000 annually. The recent fee hike will cost him an additional Dh10,000 per year for both children. “However, our school gives the option of paying the entire year’s fees in one go,” Vivek said. “This has given us a lump sum discount, so the total fee increase for me has come to about Dh3,000 per year for both children. ”Meanwhile, other parents like German expatriate Greta, whose three children attend a British syllabus school in Jumeirah, are feeling the squeeze. “I got the email yesterday that my school fees have been hiked by Dh2,000 per child per annum,” Greta shared. “That’s a total increase of Dh6,000 per year in school fees alone. The books, uniforms, and other study material are not included in that.” Greta admits that she cannot consider switching schools because her eldest child will be entering Year 11 in the upcoming academic year. Instead, she and her husband are adjusting by cutting back on some extracurricular activities to offset the additional costs.For some parents, the fee hikes have become too much to bear, prompting them to consider transferring their children to more affordable schools. Mohammed Iqbal, whose children attend a British syllabus school in Qusais, expressed relief as his school’s increase was relatively modest, Dh1,200 annually. “I was expecting a little more than that, so I am very happy,” he remarked.On the other hand, parent R.M., whose children attend another British syllabus school, has seen fee increases two years in a row. “Last year, our school increased fees by 4.55%, and this year again, they announced a 2.35% hike,” R.M. explained. “While I understand that the cost for businesses is going up, it puts a burden on parents because unfortunately, salaries don’t increase at the same rate as the costs. I began researching schools as soon as I heard about the fee hike, but then soon realized that changing schools would bring with it a fresh set of challenges. So we decided to stay put at our current one.”Umm Mohammed, another Dubai parent, decided to move her daughter to a more affordable school before the fee hike was announced. “We were paying over Dh55,000 in annual fees at our previous school,” she recalled. “It was already the higher upper limit of what we could afford. So last year, we decided to move her to another school. Now we pay Dh30,000 inclusive of school fees, uniforms, and books. When the announcement of the school fees came, I was relieved. At our previous school, the fee increase would have been really difficult for us. But now, the fee increase is about Dh1,000 per annum. It is very manageable for us. I think it was the best decision to move her,"" she added.Dubai’s private school sector has been booming, with a 12% increase in student enrollment recorded in the 2023-2024 academic year. As of the latest figures, Dubai has 227 private schools serving 387,441 students from 185 different nationalities. The rise in student numbers has likely contributed to the increased demand for private education and the subsequent fee hikes.Despite the challenges, many parents still find value in Dubai’s private education system, with some schools offering flexible payment options to help mitigate the financial strain. The diverse offerings of schools, from international curricula to specialized programs, also give parents more choices, though finding an affordable option in the current climate can be challenging.","Dubai's Knowledge and Human Development Authority approved a 2.35% increase in the Education Cost Index (ECI) for private for-profit schools for the 2025-2026 academic year.

LONDON: A British Indian relative of an elderly Indian couple killed on board the Air India flight has spoken of his anger with the airline, saying the fleet that Air India uses is terrible.Tushar Jogi and his family were shell-shocked on Thursday when the news came through that the flight their relatives were on had crashed.Jogi’s cousin’s in-laws — Vallabh Nagji Agheda, a former general manager of the electricity board in Gujarat, and his wife, Vinaben Vallabh Agheda, a housewife, both from Vadodara — were in seats 21E and 21F on the Boeing aircraft. Both in their 70s, they were to come to the UK to spend a few months with their eldest daughter, her husband, and their grandchildren who live in Reading. The daughter and her whole family were en route to Heathrow on Thursday evening to fly to India.Jogi’s cousin, and his wife, an IT engineer, had been due to go to Gatwick on Thursday night to pick them up. The elderly couple have three daughters and the other two live in Gujarat. The two sisters had rushed to Ahmedabad on Thursday with their husbands to get DNA tests done so their parents’ remains could be handed over.“We are all absolutely shattered.We are all not able to digest this reality that we have lost them sadly — my cousin’s wife has lost both parents in just a single instant,” said Jogi, getting emotional. “They are the closest relatives we have in the UK. We don’t have any other family here. We are all a close-knit family,” he said, as he prepared to travel to Reading.Maharashtra-born Jogi, a British Indian social media influencer living in London, said though the couple were in their 70s they were enjoying the perfect retirement in Vadodara and spending time with all their grandchildren. “They were very fit and healthy and their life expectancy was beyond 90. They had huge love and affection from the whole family.”He said there was a lot of British concern with Air India among the Indian diaspora in Britain at “the way they treat passengers like luggage”. “The queue management is pathetic and people in the Indian community say the Air India fleet is the most horrible one. The ex-Etihad Airways Boeing 777-300ER aircraft are pathetic – the ones running from Heathrow. Seats falling apart is the default – whether 787 or 777-300ER, these Boeing fleets are horrible. For any journey, life is more important. They have to have a policy of care. Half the infotainment systems don’t work and the food tables are even broken at times,” he added.","Tushar Jogi and his family were shell-shocked on Thursday when the news came through that the flight their relatives were on had crashed.

LONDON: UK government figures Sunday showed that more than 1,100 migrants arrived in the country on Saturday in small boats from France across the English Channel, the highest number recorded on a single day so far this year.The latest Home Office figures show that 1,194 migrants arrived in 18 boats on Saturday in what were settled weather conditions, bringing the provisional annual total so far to 14,811.That's 42% higher than the same point last year, an increase that has piled pressure on the Labour government, which returned to power nearly a year ago, partly on disillusionment with the previous conservative administration's efforts to get a grip on the numbers making the crossing.Having ditched the Conservative government's plan to send migrants who arrived in the UK by unauthorized means to Rwanda, Prime Minister Keir Starmer said his government would get control by smashing the gangs and the business models that sustain their smuggling operations.Since gaining power, Starmer's government has sought better intelligence-sharing internationally, enhanced enforcement operations in northern France, and has adopted tougher rules in its immigration legislation.French police officers were seen watching Saturday as migrants boarded at a beach in Gravelines, between Calais and Dunkirk, and authorities were then pictured escorting the boats. French authorities said they rescued 184 people.""Pretty shocking, those scenes yesterday,"" defense secretary John Healey told Sky News.He added that it is a ""huge problem"" that French police are unable to intervene to intercept boats in shallow waters, adding that the UK is pressing for the French to put new rules into operation so they can intervene.""They're not doing it, but, but for the first time for years ... we've got the level of cooperation needed,"" he told Sky News. ""We've got the agreement that they will change the way they work, and our concentration now is to push them to get that into operation so they can intercept these smugglers and stop these people in the boats, not just on the shore.""Despite French and UK efforts, the cross-Channel route, one of the world's busiest shipping lanes, remains a major smuggling corridor for people fleeing conflict or poverty. Many migrants favor the UK for reasons of language, family ties or perceived easier access to asylum and work.The home office says 36,816 people arrived in the UK on small boats in 2024, 25% more than in 2023 (29,437). The highest number of arrivals was in 2022, with 45,774.","1,194 migrants arrived in 18 boats on Saturday in what were settled weather conditions.

William’s ‘Impatient’ Duchy Rule EXPOSED | Unfiltered Management Bombshell Mirrors King Charles?





Prince William is quietly changing what it means to be heir to the throne and those who work with him say he’s not afraid to do things differently.Following King Charles’ accession in 2022, the Prince of Wales inherited the Duchy of Cornwall, a vast estate spanning over 130,000 acres across more than 20 counties in England and Wales. Now worth more than £800 million, the duchy provides income for the heir to the throne but under Prince William’s leadership, it is becoming far more than just a source of funds.The 42-year-old royal is reportedly a demanding leader who visits parts of the duchy every four to six weeks.Will Bax, the duchy’s secretary, called William ""pretty demanding,"" but in a good way.Speaking to The Telegraph, he said that the Prince is ""a man on a mission.""“He’s easy to follow because he’s got great conviction and personality, and he really wears his heart on his sleeve in terms of social interest and his desire to have a positive impact in the world.”Estate director Ben Murphy also called William’s leadership “energising”, and compared it to his father’s, ""healthy impatience, as his father did,"" which ""puts the wind in our sails,"" PeoplePrince William sees the Duchy as more than just a royal portfolio.“I see the Duchy as an extension of the work we do with the Royal Foundation,” he told the newspaper. “I see it as a branch of my philanthropy.""He further added that there’s so much good that can be done in the rural world, ""I see it as another arm to the work that I want to do, which is being a positive force for good.”Key priorities under his stewardship included tackling homelessness, supporting mental health among farmers, and boosting sustainability across rural communities. The duchy has partnered with local groups on housing initiatives and mental health outreach, particularly for those working in agriculture who often face isolation.“I’m trying to make sure I’m prioritizing stuff that’s going to make people’s lives, living in those areas, better. This is what we’re going to do to make people’s lives in Cornwall better,” William said.“That, I feel as Duke of Cornwall, is something I should be doing. It’s about responsibility, it’s about leadership and doing what’s right on the social issues of our time.”Even family getaways are laced with purpose. During visits to the Isles of Scilly with Kate and their children — Prince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis — the Prince often chats with locals about their needs. These conversations have already led to drastic results, including improved healthcare facilities, new housing for key workers, and steps towards more sustainable tourism.Bax said, “He’s asking us to change and evolve in a way to deliver positive impact at scale and at pace.”The duchy’s most recent Integrated Annual Report, released in July, reported a surplus of £23.9 million for the 2023–24 financial year, Prince William’s first full year as Duke of Cornwall.","Duchy of Cornwall is a vast estate spanning over 130,000 acres across more than 20 counties in England and Wales.

Meghan Markle 'invisible' to Montecito community?

Meghan Markle In 'Image Push' Overhaul? Royal Expert Reveals 'Anxiousness'





Since stepping away from royal life in 2020, Meghan Markle and Prince Harry have settled California their home — but their neighbours say the couple have shown little interest in becoming part of the local community.Richard Mineards, a local journalist, told the Daily Mail that while the Duke of Sussex is known to be warm and approachable, his wife has kept a much lower profile.Mineards recalled an incident where Markle reportedly turned away an elderly local historian who wished to present her with a copy of his documentary about the area. “The old man never got past the gate,” he said, adding that Markle “doesn’t play the community game.”The journalist contrasted Markle’s distant approach with that of fellow Montecito resident Oprah Winfrey, who is well-known for her visible presence at charity events.Meghan has remained practically invisible to her neighbours ever since the couple purchased their $14 million home, which has now doubled in value, Mineards said.“She’s there, of course, but she shows herself very little. Her relationship with Montecito is … distant, shall we say,” he said, adding that the former actress has managed to “cultivate a very controlled image” of herself.“She pays attention to every appearance, every word, every gesture,” the New York Post quoted.Meanwhile, Mineards described Prince Harry, 40, as “always charming, approachable, with that very recognizable Windsor accent.”The prince “has kept his good natured side,” he said.“He smiles, shakes hands, and willingly exchanges a few words.”The reporter also noted that many locals have seen Harry out and about, whether at the beach, visiting an organic coffee shop, or cycling in the nearby hills with his security following in a Range Rover.","Meghan Markle has remained practically invisible to her neighbours ever since the couple purchased their $14 million home, a local journalist said.

They inhaled a gas and scaled Everest in days. Is it the future of mountaineering?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/they-inhaled-a-gas-and-scaled-everest-in-days-is-it-the-future-of-mountaineering/articleshow/121451558.cms,"Photo/Agencies

With xenon, 'you feel better.'

The use of the gas is 'against climbing ethics.'





Climbing Mount Everest typically takes weeks, with most of that time spent at the foot of the mountain adjusting to the thin air. But four British men last week shrank that timeline dramatically, traveling from London to the summit and back in less than a week, according to the organizer of their expedition.They skipped the adjustment period, in part, by inhaling a secret weapon: xenon gas.Their feat has roiled the world of mountaineering and prompted an investigation by the Nepalese government, as use of the gas is fiercely debated. Some research has shown that xenon can quickly acclimatize people to high altitudes, even as some experts say the benefits, if any, are negligible and the side effects of its use remain unclear.Organizers said the gas was key to the speed of the climb, but their approach has prompted a broader debate that strikes at the core of mountaineering: Should scaling Mount Everest , one of sporting's greatest accomplishments, be made easier -- available to more people during a quick vacation -- with the help of a performance enhancer?""It is a provocation, especially for traditional mountaineers, who feel bad about this idea that you can climb Everest in less than a week,"" Lukas Furtenbach, who organized the exhibition, said in a phone interview from the base of the mountain.""This showed that it can work.""Furtenbach said that beginning in 2026 he planned to offer two-week round-trip excursions to Mount Everest using xenon gas, cutting the typical time needed to scale the mountain by several weeks.""This can be the future of commercially guided mountaineering on Mount Everest,"" he said.For those who live at lower elevations and have traveled to the mountains, the discomfort of altitude sickness is all too clear. Symptoms include nausea, headaches and disrupted sleep, and in some cases it can lead to brain swelling or even death.As you go higher, less oxygen is absorbed into the bloodstream with each breath. That is why so many people who climb Everest use supplemental oxygen.Xenon, an odorless gas, has been known for years to activate a molecule called the hypoxia-inducible factor, which is also turned on when people acclimate to low oxygen, said Hugh Montgomery, a professor of intensive care medicine at University College London and a mountaineer who led an expedition to Mount Everest to study how humans respond to low oxygen.""So what these people claim to have done,"" he said, ""is basically found a way to switch on the adaptation to low oxygen levels.""The group took what was known from medical science, he said, ""and have now applied it, recreationally, to sport mountaineering.""Montgomery said scientists were still unsure how xenon triggers this response.While some doctors have used the gas in the past to ""precondition"" patients to low oxygen levels -- for example, before major heart surgery -- the practice hasn't really caught on because ""it hasn't been as protective as one would hope,"" he said.Mike Shattock, a professor of cellular cardiology at King's College London, said ""xenon probably does very little, and there is virtually no reputable scientific evidence that it makes any difference.""Experts cautioned that self-medicating with xenon, which has the effects of anesthesia, could lead to overdose or death, and more study was needed to understand how the gas works and its use in mountaineering.On Mount Everest, the weeks of training and acclimation on the lower levels of the mountain are typically required to survive the ""death zone,"" the area above 26,000 feet where the air is particularly thin.The British group, which included four former special forces members, took a different approach.About 10 weeks before the expedition, the men began sleeping in hypoxic tents, which lower oxygen levels in the air and gradually acclimatized the hikers to conditions on Mount Everest, Furtenbach said.While hypoxic tents have been used by some climbers for years, the big innovation for the British expedition came two weeks before the excursion, when the men flew to Limburg, Germany, outside Frankfurt, where a doctor, Michael Fries, had been experimenting with inhaled gases in his clinic.The men wore masks hooked up to ventilators as an anesthesiologist slowly introduced higher levels of xenon into their systems.Furtenbach, who has tried xenon gas on his own mountaineering trips since 2020, said that after the treatment, users experienced enhanced breathing and the sensation of more lung volume, and ""when you do your workout or training, you feel better.""After arriving at the base of Everest, the British group climbed to the summit in less than three days, which Furtenbach said was one of the fastest times for a group that hadn't acclimatized on the mountain. (According to the Nepalese government, the record for the fastest climb overall is held by Lakpa Gelu, a Sherpa, who reached the top of the mountain in just under 11 hours.)The rapid climb by the British expedition and the use of the gas caught the eye of the Nepalese government, and the fallout has been swift.Himal Gautam, director of Nepal's tourism department, which is responsible for regulating expeditions on the nation's mountains, said in an interview that using the gas was ""against climbing ethics,"" and that it would hurt the country's tourism industry and the Sherpas who help climbers by reducing their time on the mountain.Gautam said his department was looking into the use of the gas by the British climbers, one of whom, Alistair Carns, is also a member of Parliament.In an interview, Carns said that his expedition had been in touch with the ministry and clarified with the department that it had not taken the gas on the mountain.He added that many people who want to climb Mount Everest don't have the time to spend multiple weeks acclimating.""The reality is if I had six to eight weeks to climb Everest, I would, but I'm a government minister, and I don't have time,"" he said. ""What we've done is we've proven that you can reduce the timeline safely.""Others in the mountaineering community have warned against the use of the gas.In January, the International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation, a global network that promotes and protects the sport, released a statement that said there was no evidence that xenon gas improved performance, adding that ""inappropriate use can be dangerous.""The federation noted that xenon has been on the World Anti-Doping Agency's list of banned substances since 2014 and is not approved in all countries.""From a medical point of view, off-label use without a scientific basis and with unknown health risks must be rejected,"" the statement said.Furtenbach argued that his expeditions were still using Sherpas -- five accompanied the British climbers to the summit -- and that shorter times on the mountain were safer, as they reduce the chance that climbers will be exposed to other health threats, including avalanches, hypothermia or falls.He said the prohibition of the gas by the World Anti-Doping Agency didn't apply to mountaineering because it is not a regulated competitive sport.Use of the gas gets at a core question about why people climb mountains in the first place, Montgomery said.""Is it really a good idea that we can all have what we want, when we want, as quick as we want?"" he asked. ""Are we missing out on the sacrifice you sometimes have to make to get the achievement?""""I'm not a critic,"" he added. ""But maybe just bagging every hill at speed means you miss out on the joy you could have had.""","Xenon gas can quickly acclimatize people to high altitudes, some research shows. Some experts say the benefits, if any, are negligible and the side effects of its use remain unclear. Four British men last week traveled from London to the summit and back in less than a week.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121451579,imgsize-856938,width-400,resizemode-4/121451579.jpg"

'Abundance of caution'



Passengers recount horror incident, call 'scary'







An aircraft travelling from Birmingham to Jersey passenger aircraft was forced to perform an emergency landing shortly after departure due to a ""technical issue"" affecting one of its engines.The Blue Islands aircraft, with capacity for approximately 70 passengers, departed at 15:00 BST on Sunday before returning to Birmingham Airport, successfully landing despite strong winds.The airline's representative confirmed their engineers were examining the aircraft, emphasising that passenger, crew and aircraft safety remained their top priority, BBC reported.The affected passengers received accommodation and meals for the night.The airline's official statement confirmed the crew followed standard protocols, with passengers disembarking normally.The crew received a cockpit alert indicating a ""technical issue"" and followed procedures by shutting down the engine preventively.They clarified that the engine remained under control throughout the incident.A company representative stated: ""These procedures have an abundance of caution built into them to ensure passenger safety.""Birmingham Airport confirmed one flight diversion, with no additional runway restrictions implemented.Leanne Rowe, travelling with family for holiday, attempted to calm her children whilst feeling uncertain herself.She stated: ""It was pretty scary - straight from the start it was quite rocky...""My daughter was quite upset about it... at some point in the air the captain said to us that we were going to turn around because there was a problem with the engine.""You don't really know how serious that is.""She noted fire engines were present upon landing. Lauren York described the landing as ""very worrying."" York mentioned her 20-month-old son remained asleep throughout. She said: ""When we touched ground and we were swerving all over the place, that was really frightening.""We were just holding on to him thinking are we going to make it? It was very worrying.""Sarah Brown praised the pilot's handling of the situation, despite the frightening experience.She said: ""We knew we'd get here safely in the end."" She noted that afterwards her children ""got to go in the cockpit, meet both the pilots, so they had an experience"".The AAIB decided not to investigate further after reviewing the incident.","The Blue Islands aircraft was travelling from Birmingham to Jersey.

UK renationalises first train operator under Labour reforms,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-renationalises-first-train-operator-under-labour-reforms/articleshow/121392033.cms,"Representative Image (AI-generated)

Public good:





A private train operator servicing parts of southern England, including London, on Sunday became the first to be returned to public ownership under a government plan to renationalise Britain's much-maligned railways.All UK rail operators are due to be renationalised within the next two years in a key policy launched by Prime Minister Keir Starmer following his Labour party's return to government last July after 14 years in opposition.""South Western Railway is now under public ownership. And this is just the start,"" Starmer said on X, naming the service kickstarting his government's plan.He vowed the renationalisation ""will put passengers first"", with ""better services, with simpler ticketing, on more comfortable trains"".Train passengers in Britain suffer from frequent cancellations, in addition to high ticket prices and regular confusion over which services they can be used on.The privatisation of rail operations took place in the mid-1990s under the Conservative prime minister of the time, John Major, but the rail network remained public, run by Network Rail.Four of the 14 operators in England are already run by the state owing to poor performance in recent years, but this was originally meant to be a temporary fix before a return to the private sector.Labour triumphed over the Conservative party in elections last year, with its manifesto including promises to fix the country's ailing transport services.Legislation was approved in November to bring rail operators into public ownership when the private companies' contracts expire -- or sooner in the event of poor management -- and be managed by ""Great British Railways"".Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said in a statement that will end ""30 years of fragmentation"", but warned that ""change isn't going to happen overnight"".""We've always been clear that public ownership isn't a silver bullet, but we are really firing this starting gun in that race for a truly 21st-century railway, and that does mean refocusing away from private profit and towards the public good,"" she added.In an example of how passengers might not immediately notice much difference, South Western's first service under public ownership on Sunday was set to include a rail replacement bus because of engineering work.Government figures show that the equivalent of 4 per cent of train services in Britain were cancelled in the year to April 26.The rate was 3 per cent for South Western.Rail unions -- which have staged a stream of strikes in recent years over pay and conditions due to a cost-of-living crisis -- welcomed the state takeover.""We're delighted that Britain's railways are being brought back where they belong -- into the public sector,"" said Mick Whelan, general secretary of union Aslef.""Everyone in the rail industry knows that privatisation... didn't, and doesn't, work,"" he added.Two operators serving towns and cities in southeastern and eastern England are next to be brought back into public ownership by late 2025.All the current contracts are set to expire by 2027.UK media reported that the renationalisation of South Western means a third of journeys are now on publicly owned services.The government has said renationalisation will save up to £150 million ($200 million) per year because it will no longer have to pay compensation fees to rail operators.The main rail operators in Scotland and Wales, where transport policy is handled by the devolved administrations in Edinburgh and Cardiff, are also state-owned.","South Western Railway is the first UK train operator to be returned to public ownership.

Trump teases 'Gold card' for US residency again as skepticism mounts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-teases-gold-card-for-us-residency-again-as-skepticism-mounts/articleshow/121806059.cms,"TOI correspondent from Washington:

Trump Jokes About 'Free Golden Dome' For Canada, Talks Annexation After King Charles Flags 'Danger'





MAGA supremo Donald Trump once again teased the imminent arrival of ""Trump GoldCard,"" with his minions claiming millions of foreigners are waiting to fork out $5 million each to buy American residency and a path to citizenship.Almost 15 weeks after he announced the new visa program would be rolled out in two weeks, Trump unveiled a sketchy website trumpcard.gov that merely said that ""The Trump Card is Coming"" and asked those interested to ""Enter your information below to be notified the moment access opens."" There was no date and no details of the program.Patchy details previously announced by the administration said the program, intended to replace the existing EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program, is aimed at granting permanent US residency and a ""potential path"" to citizenship for wealthy foreigners with a ""gold car"" on payment of $5 million.Unlike the EB-5 program, which requires investments in job-creating businesses, the Gold Card, now dubbed ""Trump Card"" appears to involve a straightforward $5 million payment without specific job creation requirementsTrump and his lackeys have thrown out fantastic numbers, talking up the prospect of attracting more than 1 million foreigners paying $5 million each to generate $5 trillion, a sum that could pay down the country's mounting debt that now stands at $36 trillion.While MAGA diehards seem resentful of US citizenship sold in such a crass manner to foreigners, others are fantasizing about millions of foreigners paying off the US debt and creating a surplus.US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick claimed in March that he had ""sold"" 1,000 cards (in the yet to be rolled out program), generating $5 billion, and that Elon Musk ""is building the software right now"" for the application process. But there is widespread skepticism, about both the legitimacy of the programs and the tall numbers, with some experts estimating that only 20,000–30,000 non-American centimillionaires (with a net worth of $100 million and above) globally could afford the $5 million fee, far below the 1 million targeted by Trump.There is a ceiling of 10,000 visas annually for the existing EB-5 program and even that, requiring an investment of only around 1 million, is not filled in some years. Trump has announced that there will be no ceiling on the so-called Gold Card. In further sweeteners to “wealthy and successful” individuals Trump hopes to attract to the US from across the world, he has said they would not be required to pay taxes on their global income.US lawmakers, including some Republicans, are also in a wait and watch, arguing that creating a new visa category requires congressional legislation, a power reserved for Congress under the Immigration and Nationality Act. The executive branch, they maintain, cannot unilaterally grant permanent residency or alter tax laws for foreigners.MAGA diehards have more fundamental concerns -- about a US overrun by wealthy foreigners replacing poor immigrants.","Trump unveils sketchy website trumpcard.gov that merely says ""The Trump Card is Coming"" There was no date and no details of the program.

These included endometrial ablations, biopsies, ultrasounds, vaccinations, blood tests, and STD screenings. Officials said Ghosh exaggerated the length and complexity of both in-person and telehealth visits, using billing codes that didn’t match the actual services to claim higher reimbursements. She also allegedly prepared fake patient records to justify the fraudulent claims.“When physicians submit fraudulent claims to federal health care programs, they divert taxpayer-funded resources away from those who truly need them,” said US Attorney Boutros. “Dr Ghosh’s fraud scheme was particularly egregious because she endangered the health of her patients by performing unnecessary medical procedures, including procedures that severely limited some patients' ability to have children in the future.We applaud the victims’ strength to come forward and confront this defendant.
