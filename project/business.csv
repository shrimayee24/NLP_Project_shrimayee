Athawale suggests Sambhaji memorial in Sambhajinagar over Aurangzeb tomb removal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/athawale-suggests-sambhaji-memorial-in-sambhajinagar-over-aurangzeb-tomb-removal/articleshow/119404049.cms,"NEW DELHI: Union minister Ramdas Athawale in a demands to remove Mughal emperor Aurangzeb ’s tomb in Maharashtra’s Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar , instead advocating for a grand memorial to Chhatrapati Sambhaji at the site.Speaking to reporters in Dehradun on Sunday, the Republican Party of India (Athawale) leader said that removing the tomb would not serve any purpose. “Don't remove his grave. But there should be a big memorial to Chhatrapati Sambhaji Raje in Sambhajinagar,” he stated.Athawale’s remarks come amid protests by certain Hindu groups demanding the removal of Aurangzeb’s tomb, alleging that the 17th-century Mughal ruler was responsible for atrocities against Hindus. He, however, pointed out that the site is protected by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI).“We have to move forward with the ideology of Sambhaji Maharaj but there should be peace in the country,” he said.Urging Muslims to disassociate themselves from Aurangzeb, Athawale added, “My request to the Muslim community is that you should not associate yourself with Aurangzeb. The Muslims here were Hindus. The Muslims here are not the children of Aurangzeb. They have no relation with him.”Reiterating his stance, Athawale said, “There is a demand to remove the grave of Aurangzeb in Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar. I think this cemetery is there for the last 500-600 years and it comes under the Archaeological Survey of India... The demand to remove that grave is not right. That grave is important for the history of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj ... There should be complete peace in Maharashtra...”","Union minister Ramdas Athawale in a demands to remove Mughal emperor Aurangzeb ’s tomb in Maharashtra’s Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar.

India imposes anti-dumping duties on five Chinese products to protect local industries,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-imposes-anti-dumping-duties-on-five-chinese-products-to-protect-local-industries/articleshow/119378432.cms,"India has imposed anti-dumping duties on five products imported from China, including vacuum flasks and aluminium foil, to protect local industries from unfairly low-priced imports. These goods – Soft Ferrite Cores, vacuum insulated flasks , aluminium foil, Trichloro Isocyanuric Acid , and Poly Vinyl Chloride Paste Resin – were found to be sold in India at prices below normal market value.According to notifications from the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs, the duties will be applicable for five years on imports of Soft Ferrite Cores, vacuum insulated flasks, and Trichloro Isocyanuric Acid. A provisional anti-dumping duty, up to USD 873 per tonne, has been levied on aluminium foil imports for a duration of six months, news agency PTI reported.The government has also imposed duties ranging from USD 276 per tonne to USD 986 per tonne on Trichloro Isocyanuric Acid, a chemical used for water treatment, imported from both China and Japan. For Soft Ferrite Cores, used in devices like electric vehicles, chargers, and telecom equipment, a duty of up to 35% of the CIF (cost, insurance, freight) value will be applied.In the case of vacuum insulated flasks, an anti-dumping duty of USD 1,732 per tonne has been imposed, while duties on Poly Vinyl Chloride Paste Resin imports range from USD 89 per tonne to USD 707 per tonne. These duties apply to imports from China, Korea, Malaysia, Norway, Taiwan, and Thailand, and will remain in effect for five years.These measures follow recommendations made by the Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR), the investigation arm of the Ministry of Commerce. Anti-dumping duties are imposed by countries to protect domestic industries from a surge in imports at unfairly low prices, in accordance with the rules set by the World Trade Organization (WTO).India has previously imposed similar duties on various products to counteract cheap imports from countries like China. As both India and China are WTO members, this action reflects India’s ongoing concerns about the growing trade deficit with its neighbouring country, which reached USD 85 billion in 2023-24.","India has imposed anti-dumping duties on five products imported from China.

The chaos was exacerbated by infrastructure bottlenecks and inadequate crowd management measures, which ultimately led to a deadly stampede on platforms 14 and 15.","A'stampede-like atmosphere' prevailed at New Delhi railway station on Sunday.

From 2020 to date, Centre has provided Rs 20,660 crore for road development of Ladakh,” Malhotra told journalists in Leh.The minister showcased progress on Bilaspur-Manali-Leh railway project with an Rs 1.31-lakh crore allocation. “At present, the journey from Delhi to Leh takes 40 hours (by road) but after the railway line is ready, it will reduce the distance to 20 hours,” Malhotra said. He added the Srinagar-Leh rail project had not been cancelled but put on hold.A major push for air connectivity is also on, with Rs 640 crore earmarked for a new terminal at Leh airport.With the chief executive of Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council (LAHDC) Tashi Gyalson by his side, Malhotra mentioned a flurry of projects. These included Shinku La Tunnel. PM Narendra Modi inaugurated the Rs 1,200-crore project on July 26 last year. It involves a 4.1-km twin-tube structure built at 15,800ft.

Bajinder Singh: Watch: Viral video shows self-styled Prophet Bajinder Singh assaulting woman in office,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/watch-viral-video-shows-self-styled-prophet-bajinder-singh-assaulting-woman-in-office/articleshow/119375609.cms,"Watch: Viral video shows self-styled Prophet Bajinder Singh assaulting woman in office

NEW DELHI: A CCTV video from the office of controversial preacher Bajinder Singh has surfaced online, showing him physically assaulting multiple individuals, including a woman with a child.The footage was reportedly recorded in February 2025 and has triggered massive outrage, with critics calling for strict action against the self-styled Christian prophet .In the viral video, Singh is first seen throwing a mobile phone at an employee before approaching and slapping him. Moments later, he is seen attacking a woman who had come to his office with her child.As seen in the footage, he first threw a pile of papers at her before pushing her during an altercation. The incident quickly escalated into a heated argument, with others in the office intervening to separate them.The footage comes at a time when Bajinder Singh is already under investigation in a sexual harassment case.As per PTI, a 22-year-old woman accused the pastor of harassment, stating that he took her mobile number and began sending her messages.From 2022, Singh allegedly made her sit alone in a church cabin, where he hugged her and touched her inappropriately. She further claimed that he threatened to have her and her family eliminated if she reported him. The Punjab Police registered a case against Singh on February 28, booking him under Sections 354A (sexual harassment), 354D (stalking), and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC.Following the complaint, a three-member Special Investigation Team (SIT) was formed, led by Superintendent of Police Rupinder Kaur, to probe the allegations. The National Commission for Women (NCW) has also taken cognizance of the matter and demanded swift action against Singh.Singh, however, has dismissed the allegations, calling them ""baseless.""Speaking to the media earlier, he said, ""Fake chats can be easily created these days. They should provide proof against me. Everyone in the church knows that she [the complainant] suffered from fits and was troubled by evil spirits. People come here for prayers, and our job is to pray. She is like our daughter"".Singh has a history of controversy. In 2018, he was arrested at Delhi airport over a sexual harassment case filed by a woman from Zirakpur. More recently, a Mohali court issued warrants against him in that case. In 2022, he was accused of taking money from a Delhi-based family for treating their daughter, who later died.The preacher has also been on the radar of tax authorities, with income tax raids conducted at his premises in 2023.Despite these allegations, Singh remains a well-known figure with a massive social media following. His YouTube channel, ""Prophet Bajinder Singh,"" has over 3.74 million subscribers, and his sermons often attract large crowds, both in India and abroad.Celebrities such as actors Chunky Pandey and Aditya Pancholi have previously endorsed him.","CCTV video shows self-styled Christian prophet Bajinder Singh physically assaulting multiple individuals, including a woman with a child.

"India-EU FTA game changer for German industries, investment into India: German envoy Philip Ackermann",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-eu-fta-game-changer-for-german-industries-investment-into-india-german-envoy-philip-ackermann/articleshow/119388492.cms,"German ambassador Philipp Ackermann

EU’s most powerful state Germany believes the 2025-end deadline for the India-EU FTA , potentially the largest deal of its kind in the world, can be met, leading to an agreement that would be a game changer for many of its industries while also attracting more investments into India. In an interview to TOI, German ambassador Philip Ackermann said the last round of FTA talks, held after European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen’s visit last month during which the deadline was announced, was “quite fruitful and better than the previous rounds”.As Chancellor-in-waiting Friedrich Merz looks to preside over a “sea change” in Germany’s security policy, shunning longstanding austerity measures to dramatically boost defence spending amid fears of a US retreat, the ambassador ruled out any dilution of Berlin’s commitment to the Indo-Pacific, saying it will continue to be actively involved in the region, including through potential joint military exercises. The conservative leader, who is expected to be elected chancellor next month as a new coalition government takes over, is seeking a stronger European focus on defence and more “independence” from Donald Trump’s America.“Progress on the FTA was one of the substantive outcomes from European Commission president’s visit. The end-of-2025 deadline now seems possible. You have to now reach that goal and I understand the last round of talks after the visit was quite fruitful and was better than the previous rounds. I am cautiously optimistic that we will achieve a good agreement. Germany is hugely interested in this agreement. I think it would be a game changer for many of our industries. It would certainly attract more investment to India. We feel that it would change important parts of our economy,’ said Ackermann.Asked about the Indo-Pacific and India-Germany ties under Merz, the ambassador said Germany has been very clear that Indo-Pacific is an important area for security and trade where India has turned out to be a very good partner. “We think along the same lines, and you can be sure that Germany will continue to be committed to the Indo-Pacific. Like you saw last year with the Tarang Shakti air exercise. Germany will continue to be active along with European, American partners and Indian partners. India with common navy and air force exercises is growing closer to European security and armed forces,’’ said Ackermann, adding there’s a clear continuity now in Germany’s India policy and the 2024 ‘Focus on India’ paper will prevail.Asked about Trump’s indifference to Europe and conflicting signals on NATO, the ambassador said there was a clear signal from Washington that it would like to see European countries spending more on defence but added Europe-America alliance isn’t in any imminent danger. Describing Merz as a Transatlanticist, Ackermann said the new government will make a lot of efforts to keep that alliance meaningful.“Outside Europe, America is our closest ally and we don’t see that changing quickly. At the same time, we have to take into account the discourse in Washington is now different from what it was earlier and we have to adapt to that. Europe has to spend more. You have seen von der Leyen’s Rearm Europe programme that means defence production must increase and small countries should pay more. We feel threatened. Russians have shown they have no scruples, or shame in invading other countries. Why should they stop at Ukraine? It’s important to be better prepared,’’ said the ambassador, talking about what he called a sea change in Germany’s defence policy.While backing all efforts to end the war, he said Russia had basically not accepted the ceasefire proposal and it’s important to understand there can be no peace without Ukraine. “And I think Americans also understand that as they have involved Ukraine in the latest talks in Jeddah,’’ said Ackermann.","The 2025-end deadline for the India-EU FTA is potentially the largest deal of its kind in the world.

Examination of judge's CDR will need expert help

NEW DELHI: CJI Sanjiv Khanna 's prompt move to order a judicial inquiry into charges of cash being found at Justice Yashwant Varma 's residence notwithstanding, the task ahead for the three-member panel could be tedious and time-consuming as it involves examining many people and requires assistance of experts to analyse the judge's call data records .The panel of Punjab & Haryana CJ Sheel Nagu, Himachal Pradesh CJ G S Sandhawalia and Karnataka HC's Anu Sivaraman, all seasoned judges with over a decade's experience in constitutional courts, will have to take out time to list people to be examined.In the list will be the first responders to the fire in the storeroom of Justice Varma's residence on March 14 night, which the police chief claimed mostly remained locked but the judge said was accessed by staff, gardeners and PWD staff.The panel will take the help of forensic experts to verify the authenticity of the video of burnt cash shot by the first responders and also examine whether the place where cash was burnt matched with the storeroom at the judge's residence.Since Justice Varma cited the Delhi fire chief 's ""no cash found at the judge's residence"" statement in his defence, the latter may also be summoned and asked about the basis for his statement and subsequent U-turn.Security personnel who said ""debris and half-burnt"" articles were removed by the judge's staff on March 15 - a charge denied by Justice Varma - will also be examined along with their colleagues who were on security duty at the bungalow on Tughlaq Crescent for the last six months. Staff who worked at Justice Varma's residence, including his personal assistants, will be called as well.Another important aspect of the inquiry is the examination of call data records of the phones used by Justice Varma in his official and personal capacity. The inquiry panel will require assistance of experts in information technology and telecom industries for this. The judge has been asked not to delete any data from his phones.The Delhi Police commissioner had informed Delhi HC CJ D K Upadhyay on March 15 that ""the storeroom is adjacent to the guard room where Central Reserve Police Force (Battalion 70F) is posted and the storeroom used to be kept locked"". However, the judge in his defence had said, ""The room was being used as a storeroom to keep useless household articles and remained accessible to all and sundry and was not kept locked.""However, the Delhi HC CJ's report said, ""The enquiry conducted by me, prima facie, does not reveal possibility of entry or access to the room by any person other than those residing in the bungalow, the servants, the gardeners and CPWD personnel, if any. Accordingly, I am of the prima facie opinion that the entire matter warrants a deeper probe.""In his explanation, Justice Varma had said, ""I once again make it clear that no one from my house ever reported seeing any currency in burnt form in the room. In fact, this gets further corroborated from there being no cash or currency which we saw when the site was restored to us after the fire personnel and police had left the scene, quite apart from we being not apprised of any recovery or seizure made on the spot. This may also be viewed in light of the statement of the chief of the fire service which I have gathered from news reports.""",Examination of judge's CDR will need expert help from three-member panel.

"At Rs 400 crore per year, Bharthana in Gujarat India's top toll plaza",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/at-rs-400-crore-per-year-bharthana-in-gujarat-indias-top-toll-plaza/articleshow/119396489.cms,"45,000km of 1.5 lakh km NH network under tolling; FASTag impact visible

How many people would have heard of Bharthana? Not many, for sure. But a toll plaza near this Gujarat village on the Vadodara-Bharuch section of NH-48, connecting Delhi with Mumbai - the busiest route in the country - is the top toll grosser, generating an average of Rs 400 crore annually over the past five years.Given the volume of goods traffic that moves between landlocked states in north India and ports on the country's western coast, it isn't surprising that the toll plaza in Shahjahanpur in Rajasthan - also on NH-48 - garnered the second highest user fee of Rs 378 crore a year.Data shared by road transport and highways ministry in Lok Sabha last week showed that of the 1,063 toll plazas in India's NH network, 14 reported collection of over Rs 200 crore a year. Currently, around 45,000km of the 1.5 lakh km of NHs, including the newly-built expressways, is under tolling.With a large chunk becoming commercially operational over the last five years and the impact of FASTag showing (in checking leakages), annual toll collection doubled from Rs 27,504 crore in 2019-20 to Rs 55,882 crore in the last financial year.Govt data showed that commuters shelled out little over Rs 1.9 lakh crore in toll over the past five years, although it's barely a fifth of the annual budget spent for highway development and maintenance during this period. Govt collects toll only on highways that are of at least two-and-half lanes (two-lane with paved shoulders) and there is a huge thrust to bring more highways under tolling to increase revenue.Data shared in Parliament showed that among the states, 97 toll plazas in Uttar Pradesh reported the maximum collection at Rs 22,914 crore during the past five years. Rajasthan, which has the highest number of 156 toll plazas, recorded a collection of Rs 20,308 crore (see graphic).Typically, toll collection is higher at plazas located on the NHs that connect ports and industrial hubs. ""These plazas get more commercial and heavy goods vehicles, which pay higher toll compared to private vehicles. So, these projects have been viable for private players,"" an official said.","Of the 1,063 toll plazas in India's NH network, 14 reported collection of over Rs 200 crore a year.

'India has potential to play global role in nuclear technology market',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-has-potential-to-play-global-role-in-nuclear-technology-market/articleshow/119396395.cms,"International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi

Rafael Mariano Grossi

, director-general of the

International Atomic Energy Agency

(IAEA), was in India recently and met with top policymakers. In an interview with TOI’s Surojit Gupta, Grossi discussed the situations in Iran and Ukraine and praised India’s

nuclear energy initiatives

. Excerpts:

How do you view the nuclear situation in Iran?

The engagement you talked about... Is there a possibility of that taking place with the top powers to find a solution?

You have made a number of visits to Ukraine. How is the situation there now?

How do you see India's move to use nuclear energy in the country's energy transition plan?

And how do you see the recent announcement of allowing the private sector in the small reactor segment?

We still have a lot of work to do. I have said many times that Iran does not have nuclear weapons at the moment, but they are enriching uranium at almost weapon grade level and that they have not provided clear answers on a number of things to IAEA for quite a long time. We are being fair, but at the same time firm in that we do not want to exaggerate anything, but neither do we want to banalise any situation. Iran has a very important, ambitious, technologically developed nuclear programme and they have to provide the answers. We see that there is a movement around the issue. We have witnessed an important meeting in Beijing recently between Russia, China and Iran. We think it's positive. We see that there has been an exchange or at least a letter sent by US President Donald Trump to the Supreme Leader. Even with the polemic around the contents and the replies, etc it means that there is a recognition that there has to be an engagement of some sort. So yes, it is a global concern for the reasons I explained. At the same time, this should be an incentive for all of us to work together to avoid an escalation which, against the backdrop of what is happening in the Middle east, would be tragic.There is a possibility, but this will not be endless or the time will not be limitless. There should be a sense of finality. We want an issuance which is positive, which is diplomatic and non-violent, but at the same time one that provides the international community with assurances. It's in everybody's interest. This is what I say when I talk to my Iranian counterparts.It continues to be fragile. And for as long as combat continues, it will still be the case. Let's never forget the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is on the front line. It's very exposed. It has been targeted in the past. There have been many blackouts, situations where the power supply to and from the station was completely interrupted. You remember one of the cooling towers last summer was up in fire. So it is clearly a target. The presence of IAEA there has mitigated the risks, but not eliminated them. We look with expectation, like everybody else, the possibility of a dialogue and negotiation leading to a ceasefire and possibly and hopefully to peace. But until that happens, our concern is that no nuclear accident takes place.I see this very positively. India has top notch technology which it derived initially from western technology. Then you went into your own indigenous development with very good reactors, 20 of them operating flawlessly. But still nuclear is a minute percentage of the national electricity production. And I was happy to see that govt is aiming at going much, much higher - 100 gigawatts, which is possible. I see India as a country that has enormous internal potential, but also, if I may, I see India playing a role globally. Nuclear technology is being exported. And I don't see why India should not be joining the family of vendors who are active in the global market.That for me is a fundamental piece of the puzzle that shows that govt is adjusting its approach and trying to attune to the realities in the world. Nuclear is capital intensive, and not everything can come from public or public utilities. And when you have the needs that you have in India, you have to explore public-private partnerships or even private ownership of plants, including small modular reactors. I see this change in the legal and policy approach from India as a step, a huge step in the right direction.","Rafael Mariano Grossi, director-general of the.

BJP picks Union minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar as state president for new Kerala push,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bjp-picks-union-minister-rajeev-chandrasekhar-as-state-president-for-new-kerala-push/articleshow/119394140.cms,"T'PURAM: BJP brass has hand-picked businessman and former Union minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar (60) as the party's Kerala unit chief. His selection is believed to have been made by PM Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah , with a strategic plan to steer BJP in a new direction in the state. His appointment will be officially announced at BJP state council meeting in Thiruvananthapuram on Monday.Leading up to his nomination, Chandrasekhar was reportedly not keen on leading the state unit, citing his lack of political experience. However, sources suggest that his real hesitation stemmed from his preoccupation with his extensive business empire.On Sunday morning, he received instructions to file his nomination for BJP state unit president, just hours before he was scheduled to travel abroad for an international AI conference in Australia. He submitted his nomination following a core committee meeting in Thiruvananthapuram in the evening. The event was attended by incumbent BJP state chief K Surendran, Union ministers Suresh Gopi and George Kurian, former Union minister V Muraleedharan, national executive committee member PK Krishnadas, and Kummanam Rajasekharan.Chandrasekhar's appointment is seen as part of BJP's strategy to reposition the party as an aspirational political force capable of challenging CPM's narrative on development politics. His leadership could also help rein in factional feuds within the state unit. The new role of outgoing president Surendran is expected to be announced in the coming days.In the last Lok Sabha elections, Chandrasekhar gave a tough fight to Shashi Tharoor in the Thiruvananthapuram constituency, winning over a large section of young voters. He was projected as a ""no-nonsense, development-focused"" candidate and a direct representative of Modi.Entering politics in 2006, Chandrasekhar has served three terms in Rajya Sabha, representing Karnataka.Born in Ahmedabad to Air Commodore MK Chandrasekhar and Valli, he has ancestral roots in Palakkad.Chandrasekhar's appointment also signals that BJP wants dedicated full-time politicians, rather than part-time political figures. A similar approach was seen in the case of actor-turned-politician Suresh Gopi, who was made a Union minister despite his preference to continue acting while serving as Thrissur MP.","Chandrasekhar's appointment seen as part of BJP's strategy to reposition the party as an aspirational political force.

This entailed unexpected out-of-pocket expenditure (OOPE) though the scheme was meant to provide cashless hospitalisation and bring down out of pocket expenses.A 2023 CAG report too had noted that 75 out of the 121 healthcare providers de-empanelled from 2018 to 2021 were found to be engaged in illegal money collection and other fraudulent practices.According to a paper published by Centre for Health Equity, Law and Policy and the Association for Socially Applicable Research, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Uttarakhand topped the list for grievances related to the quality of hospital services, and Maharashtra, Assam and Bihar led in eligibility and registration issues . Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh had the highest proportion of grievances related to poor behaviour of hospital and programme staff and related to quality of programmatic service.""While the majority of grievances about hospital service quality were due to hospitals demanding money for treatment, most grievances related to eligibility and registration stemmed from problems with the issuance of beneficiary cards,"" stated the study.The paper published in the Social Science Research Network of Elsevier, an open-access online preprint community and repository, examined a total of 1.1 lakh grievances filed by beneficiaries under the AB-PMJAY grievance redress system from Oct 2018 to March 2022 at the national, state and district levels. However, 67% of the grievances were categorised as 'other' and could not be included in the analysis. This was also true of those categorised as 'inquiry' or 'feedback', which were another 3%. ""We filed an RTI with the National Health Authority to find out what 'other' meant, but were told that this was the category chosen by the beneficiary,"" explained Shefali Malhotra, one of the authors of the paper.Though quality of hospital services constituted the highest proportion of grievances analysed, those related to registration and eligibility for the Ayushman card constituted the highest proportion during the Covid years. Within complaints about quality of hospital services, 74% was related to the hospital demanding money. Other reasons included denial of treatment (15%), hospitals holding onto ABPMJAY cards 6%, non-availability of medicines and diagnostics in the hospital (2.2%), and poor quality of treatment (2%).""The incidence of grievances in Assam was markedly higher than in other states and union territories participating in the AB-PMJAY programme, throughout the study period.

Possible reasons for this are highlighted in the 2023 CAG report, which points out considerable delays, 187 days on average, in the approval and rejection of beneficiaries' registration,"" noted the study adding that this could be attributed to the 70% manpower shortage in the state health agency as flagged by the CAG.","An analysis of grievances filed by beneficiaries of Ayushman Bharat has shown that the highest number were about hospitals demanding money for treatment.

NEW DELHI: Soon getting details of housing projects and performance of builders across the country will be just a click away, a move that will help homebuyers to make informed decisions before booking a property.All the real estate regulatory authorities (RERAs) across the country will have uniform websites and IT platforms for better navigation, which will enable consumers to get the project status of builders wherever they are developing residential and commercial projects.At present, different RERAs host details on their websites in different manner and the details of only those builders and project status are hosted on sites that fall under their jurisdiction. So, it’s a cumbersome process for buyers to navigate through every RERA website and get details.The housing and urban affairs ministry and All India Forum Of Real Estate Regulatory Authorities (AIFORERA), the umbrella body of all RERAs, have started work on this. Sources said the modalities are in final stage and the new mechanism will be a win-win for all.“This will help buyers to access the necessary information easily. It will also help regulatory authorities in retrieving the data for better implementation of the law,” said Anand Kumar, chairman of AIFORERA, who is also chairman of Delhi RERA.Registration of all projects is mandatory under the RERA and progress of projects are also tracked by each authority as are timelines and any extensions. So, interlinking the data from each RERA to make it accessible for buyers will not be an issue.Welcoming the move, Abhay Upadhyaya, a member of govt’s Central Advisory Council said, “To make this more effective and useful for homebuyers, all projects of any particular builder are shown under its group. Most of the builders form separate SPV for different projects and some of their projects may have bad track records. Therefore unless all their project details are transparently displayed under their group, homebuyers cannot take informed decisions.”","All the real estate regulatory authorities (RERAs) across the country will have uniform websites and IT platforms.

The Sisyphus Clause



The Myth of Sisyphus

I said that the world is absurd, but I was too hasty. This world in itself is not reasonable, that is all that can be said. But what is absurd is the confrontation of this irrational and the wild longing for clarity whose call echoes in the human heart. The absurd depends as much on man as on the world. Albert Camus

So maybe Pakistan is happier.

Not because it is richer, freer, safer, or better—

But because, like Sisyphus, it has made peace with the mountain.

And it no longer asks why.

Long before he became a meme for slapping Chris Rock at the Oscars for a joke that seemed like a punchline for Big Pharma to sell some follicular solutions, Will Smith acted in some remarkable movies. One of the most moving was, a fine film on paternal-filial relationships. In a rather dark moment, he wonders if Thomas Jefferson gaslit America by stating in the Declaration of Independence that every American would be endowed with certain rights, including life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. He says in the movie: “And I remember thinking: how did he know to put the pursuit part in there? That maybe happiness is something that we can only pursue and maybe we can actually never have it. No matter what.”It’s a sentiment that theappears to agree with—at least for Indians , who have been rankeddespite the fact that it’s a rising global power—one of the few, to borrow a line from the proverbial egg-faced Shashi Tharoor , whose leader can hug both the premiers of Ukraine and Russia.But that’s hardly surprising, because it completely fits into the WENA (Western Europe and Northern American) idea of India. If one were to learn about India solely from Anglosphere coverage, one would assume that India was a genocidal hellhole where the living conditions were worse than sub-Saharan Africa.The fact is that if irony could be measured, the World Happiness Report 2025 would be a more shoddily written Don Quixote. India is ranked 118th—below Saudi Arabia (32), Libya (79), Venezuela (82), Uzbekistan (53), Rwanda (116), China (68), Iran (99), Lebanon (104), Palestine (108), Pakistan (109), Ukraine (111), Iraq (101), Cameroon (104), a list that includes war zones, authoritarian regimes, debt-ridden states, and nations facing civil unrest. Even if one were to accept that there are enough citizens of the world who prefer being a fed sparrow to a hungry songbird, even Pakistanis would be shocked to learn that they are ranked above India and would wonder if the only person surveyed for this poll was Osama Bin Laden So, before we get into the problem with the methodology, let’s do a simple headcount between India and Pakistan. Currently, India’s GDP is $3.7 trillion—the fifth largest in the world and the only one after the US to outstrip its former colonial rulers. Pakistan, meanwhile, is a $375 billion economy—not even 10% of India’s size. India’s digital economy is booming, startups are thriving, and infrastructure is expanding at a record pace. Meanwhile, Pakistan’s economy is lurching from one IMF bailout to another like a tippler looking for his next drink.Pakistan is essentially running on loans. The country has over $125 billion in external debt, with crippling inflation and foreign reserves barely enough to cover a few weeks of imports. It defaulted on several payments before being saved by yet another IMF bailout. India, by contrast, is not only managing its debt prudently but has become a net lender to the IMF.As for the contrasting militaries, there’s a delightful anecdote from 1957 recalled by Anvar Alikhan in apiece titled, where he draws parallels between the militaries of the two countries.He writes: “A true story: In 1957, the then Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru , visiting the office of General Thimayya, the Chief of the Army Staff, saw a steel cabinet behind his desk and asked the general what it contained. The general replied that the top drawer contained the nation’s defence plans. And the second drawer contained the confidential files of the nation’s top generals. And what about the third drawer, enquired Nehru. Ah, said the general with a straight face, the third drawer contains my secret plans for a military coup against you. Nehru laughed, but there was apparently a tinge of nervousness to his laughter.”While the idea of a military coup in India remained a joke locked in a cabinet, in Pakistan, the military was so good at dealing with law and order and other issues that whenever martial law was declared, people would rejoice: “” playing on the termWhile India became a nuclear-armed democracy—warts and all—Pakistan devolved into a de facto military state whose generals always had more power than elected officials. Coups happened with the alacrity of Friday prayers. In fact, Imran Khan was propped up by the military to counter mainstream politicians, but the former World Cup winner soon became more powerful than his puppeteers intended. Yet, a country where the army decides your prime minister, your policies, and sometimes even your breakfast menu is apparently living its best life.Yes, India’s secularism is under scrutiny and faces legitimate criticism. But it still remains a constitutionally enshrined, functioning democracy with an independent judiciary, regular elections, and a diverse press. Pakistan, in contrast, is a state founded on religious identity and has institutionalised discrimination against minorities. Ahmadiyyas can’t even call themselves Muslim, and Hindus are regularly persecuted. Minorities live under a blasphemy law that’s been used more as a weapon than a shield.So, how exactly does a theocracy with enforced religious conformity and institutional bigotry outscore a pluralist democracy—even if imperfect?India is seen as a rising power on the global stage. It’s hosting G20 summits, mediating in global conflicts, and pushing for a multipolar world. Pakistan, meanwhile, is often the subject of IMF reports, FATF warnings, and UN human rights resolutions. India’s passport opens doors; Pakistan’s passport raises eyebrows.In fact, the contrast between India and Pakistan can even be seen in both nations’ favourite pastimes: cricket. In recent years, much to the chagrin of English and Australian columnists, India has become the de facto Trump of world cricket —big enough to call the shots—so much so that when Pakistan finally got the chance to host a Champions Trophy, India refused to set foot. While the Pakistani team went out dismally in the group stage, India romped home to pick up the trophy without as much as breaking a sweat. To add insult to injury, India’s dominance meant that Pakistan (the hosts) had to travel to Dubai to play its match, and India reaching the final robbed Pakistan of the spectacle.India’s changed standing on the global stage can be summarised by the contrasting online reaction to a tweet from an American commentator with a Ukraine flag (a marker of online inanity), which wondered why there was no outrage when Prime Minister Modi (like Zelenskyy) wasn’t dressed in a suit. Most commentators pointed out that Modi was dressed in traditional garb (a kurta pyjama and a jacket) as opposed to Zelenskyy’s cosplay sweatshirt and khakis. However, the real kicker was even white Americans—who often spend time mocking JD Vance’s wife —defended the Indian Prime Minister because he wasn’t in America asking for more funds and weapons.The implication that India—a growing economy, a space-faring democracy, and a hub of innovation—is less “happy” than war-torn or economically collapsed nations raises serious questions about the methodology behind these rankings. The report relied heavily on subjective self-assessments, primarily via Gallup’s “Cantril Ladder,” where respondents rated their lives on a scale from 0 to 10. These were then modelled against six variables: GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom, generosity, and perceptions of corruption. However, many of these variables were based more on perceptions than hard data. In societies where expectations are low, or media is tightly controlled, people often report higher satisfaction. In contrast, in dynamic democracies like India, rising aspirations, political noise, and media scrutiny tend to yield harsher self-assessments—even in the midst of tangible progress.All of this brought renewed attention to the flaws of international perception-based indices—something Sanjeev Sanyal and Aakanksha Arora had flagged in a 2022 working paper . They had offered a pointed critique of three influential global indices: Freedom in the World (by Freedom House), Democracy Index (by the Economist Intelligence Unit), and the V-Dem Indices (by the University of Gothenburg)—all of which had routinely rated India poorly.Sanyal-Arora had argued that these indices were largely opinion-driven, relying on small, opaque pools of anonymous “experts” whose identities, qualifications, and nationalities were often undisclosed. Freedom House, for instance, used 25 subjective questions assessed by internal analysts and external advisers, but published no transparency on scoring mechanisms. The EIU claimed to use public opinion, yet India’s last World Values Survey input dated back to 2012—meaning more recent assessments were based almost entirely on expert opinion. V-Dem, meanwhile, used 473 variables, many of them highly subjective, including notions like “self-censorship” or “deliberative quality of governance.”They also noted that many of the questions used were ill-suited for cross-country comparisons, such as “how pervasive is corruption?” or “to what extent is direct popular vote utilised?”—metrics that penalised democracies like India and the US for not holding national referendums, while awarding higher scores to one-party states like Cuba.India and Pakistan are on two different trajectories, and even the honest Pakistani knows that. If Albert Camus was right, then perhaps the secret to happiness lies not in prosperity, democracy, or purpose—but in the acceptance of futility, the repetition of struggle, and the knowledge that there is no divine reward at the summit.In, Camus describes a man condemned to eternally roll a boulder up a mountain, only for it to roll back down each time. It is an absurd fate, but in contemplating it—knowing it is his, accepting it as unchangeable—Sisyphus becomes, paradoxically, free. Camus writes: “One must imagine Sisyphus happy.”Perhaps this, then, explains Pakistan’s higher ranking in the World Happiness Report 2025. Perhaps Pakistan is the Sisyphus of South Asia. A nation locked in a cycle of economic collapse, military coups, IMF bailouts, energy shortages, and cricketing heartbreak, and yet—it smiles on the way back down the hill.Where India fights, debates, builds, reforms, and aspires—Pakistan accepts. It no longer expects the summit. Its happiness is not driven by achievement but by survival, not by growth but by repetition. Where India agonises over its democracy, Pakistan no longer pretends to have one. Where India chases global leadership, Pakistan is content negotiating its next loan. There is peace in low expectations, freedom in detachment. If happiness is the absence of disillusionment, then what better strategy than to stop being illusioned in the first place?And so, while Indians grumble through traffic jams in growing cities, rage against corruption, or demand better governance, Pakistanis return to their rock each morning, lift it with muscle memory, and smile—because nothing else was promised. As Camus wrote: “Each atom of that stone... forms a world.”Every bailout is a new beginning. Every coup, a cosmic reset. Every World Cup loss, a philosophical cleansing. They roll the rock. It rolls back. The absurd cycle is complete. Meanwhile, India is caught in its own existential spiral—still believing happiness is to be earned, still chasing Jefferson’s promise of “the pursuit”, still demanding meaning from its journey. But as Camus warns, meaning is a human construct. The world owes us none.","India is ranked 118th among 147 countries in the World Happiness Report 2025.

"Trump Gold Card: Gold Card visa too expensive? US confirms selling 1,000 a day",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/gold-card-visa-too-expensive-us-confirms-selling-1000-a-day/articleshow/119343497.cms,"Commerce secretary Howard Lutnick said he sold 1,000 Gold Card a day.

What is US Gold Card?



Donald Trump's Gold Card visa needs an individual to pay straight $5 million to get US citizenship while the administration is concentrating on sweeping the 'illegal' ones out. While the program triggered discussions on whether it is too expensive for US citizenship, commerce secretary Howard Lutnick said he sold 1,000 Gold Cards a day. ""There are 37 million people in the world who are capable of buying the card... The president thinks we can sell a million,"" Lutnick said speaking on All-In Podcast.Lutnick said Trump got the idea of the Gold Card during a meeting he had with investor John Paulson. Lutnick was then taken in the loop to figure out how to do it. Elon Musk is building the software, Lutnick said.On why anyone should buy the Gold Card, Lutnick said had he not been an American, he would have bought six Gold Cards, one for him, one for his wife and other family members -- so that if something happens like war or any other crisis, he could have come to the US and start afresh -- starting a new business.Lutnick elaborated that the Gold Card would replace the traditional green card, granting holders permanent US residency. While cardholders could pursue citizenship, he suggested most would opt against it to avoid US global taxation. Priced at $5 million each, the cards would offer the right to live in the US indefinitely.Prices at $5 million, the Gold Card program would replace the EB-5 immigrant investor visa program. EB-5s were created in 1990 as a method for immigrants to obtain green cards in which a person must invest at least $1 million in a company –or $800k in a low-income area – that employs at least 10 people. In 2024, more than 4,500 EB-5 visas were issued.Trump said there would be no cap on the number of gold cards issued."," commerce secretary Howard Lutnick said he sold 1,000 Gold Cards a day.

It benefits from strong client additions and industry demand tailwinds. Q3FY25 revenue grew 65% YoY, driven by RAC & electronics. Future growth is supported by capacity expansion. Amber is expanding its EMS segment, investing INR 6.5B in Ascent Circuit, and participating in India’s component PLI via a JV with Korea Circuit. Govt push for domestic manufacturing and potential incentives for electronics could benefit Amber. We estimate a revenue/EBITDA/PAT CAGR of 26%/33%/62% over FY24-27.Powergen market demand over last 2 quarters was impacted by steep pricing increase & pre-buying ahead of CPCB 4+ implementation Demand is expected to stabilize from FY26, with ind. Vol. reaching 36-38k units in Q4, leading to improved volumes for KOEL. We expect KOEL to benefit from a shift towards mid to high kVA powergen segments, increased focus on new industrial areas, improved distribution touchpoints and better B2C profitability in the coming years. We estimate KOEL to achieve 17%/19% CAGR in EBITDA/PAT, with strong growth in B2B & 10% CAGR in B2C segment & EBITDA margin expanding to 13% by FY26.

Minnesota Governor Tim Walz clarified his recent remarks about Tesla stocks, saying that he was “making a joke”. Speaking at an event in New York, Walz said “This guy bugs me in a way that’s probably unhealthy,” referring to Elon Musk. “I have to be careful about being a smart**s. I was making a joke. These people have no sense of humor. They are the most literal people,” he added. Last week, Walz – a democrat posted on X: “If you need a little boost during the day, check out Tesla stock. ”He also shared a video in which he said “Some of you know this. On the iPhone, they’ve got that little stock app. I added Tesla to it to give me a little boost during the day — $225 and dropping,” Walz said. “And if you own one, we’re not blaming you. You can take dental floss and pull the Tesla thing off.”The governor’s remarks sparked swift criticism, notably from “Shark Tank” investor Kevin O’Leary, who slammed them as “beyond stupid,” pointing out that Minnesota’s State Board of Investments holds 1.6 million Tesla shares in its retirement fund.“That poor guy didn’t check his portfolio and his own pension plan for his state,” O’Leary said on CNN. “What’s the matter with that guy? He doesn’t check the well-being of his own constituents? What a bozo.”Clarifying his remarks further, Walz said: “But my point was, they’re all mad, and I said something I probably shouldn’t have about a company.However, Walz continued to criticize Musk for his role in the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). “They’re all butthurt about the Tesla thing, but they don’t care about the disrespect they have shown to employees at the Minneapolis VA who care for our veterans, and they fire them. They don’t care,” he said.“Maybe it’s just me. If I’m the richest man in the world, I’m like out on the streets handing out money,” he added. “It’d be fun as hell just to help people out.

Vodafone Idea (Vi) CEO Akshaya Moondra has reportedly urgently requested the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) Secretary Neeraj Mittal to approve equity conversion for the company's pending Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR) and spectrum auction dues from 2012, 2014, 2015, and 2016. According to an exclusive report in Economic Times, this plea comes as Vi faces a significant increase in regulatory payments and struggles with its current financial situation.According to the report, Moondra's letter to the DoT, dated March 11, outlines Vodafone-Idea's inability to provide a Rs 6,091 crore bank guarantee or make a Rs 5,493 crore cash payment related to a shortfall from the 2015 spectrum auction. He has asked the DoT to refrain from taking any punitive measures against the company.Vodafone-Idea's request for equity conversion, as per the 2021 Telecom Reform Package, aims to address the company's cash flow challenges. Moondra's proposal seeks to convert Rs 36,950 crore of dues into equity, calculated on a net present value (NPV) protected basis. This conversion would potentially increase the government's stake in Vodafone-Idea from the current 22.6% to 49%, including a proposed conversion of Rs 13,809 crore related to the 2015 spectrum payment.Moondra reportedly specifically requested “support for equity conversions up to the threshold of government of India shareholdings at 49%, that is, an amount of Rs 36,950 crore on NPV protected basis, subject to customary approvals at our end.”However, at Vodafone-Idea's current market capitalization of approximately Rs 54,401 crore, a 49% stake would be valued at around Rs 26,656.5 crore. The telco has not yet responded to requests for comment. The DoT's decision on Vodafone-Idea's request is crucial, especially given the recent stalling of a proposal to waive AGR dues , which has significantly impacted the financially strained telecom operator.","Vodafone Idea (Vi) CEO Akshaya Moondra has reportedly requested the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) Secretary Neeraj Mittal to approve equity conversion for the company's pending Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR) and spectrum auction dues from 2012, 2014, 2015, and 2016.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Delhi Results 2025: 'LinkedIn Lessons' from Brand BJP's win and Brand AAP's loss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-results-2025-linkedin-lessons-from-brand-bjps-win-and-brand-aaps-loss/articleshow/118066797.cms,"AAP: From Disruptor to Establishment to Decline



AAP was the ultimate political startup—the kind that raises Series A, B, and C funding at record speed, becomes a unicorn, and then implodes under its own weight. It was supposed to be the alternative to traditional politics, the fresh face in a crowded market, a party that rejected caste, religion, and dynasty-driven politics.

But somewhere along the way, it stopped being a startup and started behaving like an old-school corporate giant—bloated, bureaucratic, and overconfident.

1) From Lean & Agile to Bureaucratic & Slow

AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach—the political equivalent of a D2C brand shaking up a legacy market.

Over time, it became centralized and top-heavy, with decision-making confined to a handful of leaders. MLAs became inaccessible, the leadership became distant, and ground-level mobilization weakened. No succession planning. Kejriwal remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force.

remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force. The result? Voters saw it as just another party, not the disruptor it once was.

2) A Reputation Built on Ethics, Lost to Scandals

AAP built its brand on fighting corruption—but its own leadership got embroiled in one of the biggest scandals of its time, the liquor policy scam.

Manish Sisodia, Sanjay Singh, and even Kejriwal himself faced corruption allegations, undoing years of anti-corruption positioning.

The Sheesh Mahal controversy—where Kejriwal’s residence was allegedly renovated with ₹45 crore of taxpayer money—completely shattered the “humble leader” narrative.

AAP’s response? Defensive, aggressive, and dismissive. Instead of damage control, it doubled down on denial—a classic PR blunder.

The perception shift was swift and brutal—from “anti-corruption warriors” to just another power-hungry political entity.

3) Ignoring the Middle-Class Voter That Built Its Base

AAP was originally the party of the middle class—frustrated taxpayers who wanted clean governance and economic relief.

Over time, its focus shifted to freebies and populist policies, leaving the middle class feeling ignored.

BJP stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters.

stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters. Kejriwal’s pre-election outreach to the middle class felt forced and last-minute—while BJP had already solidified its positioning.

Takeaway ? A business (or party) that forgets its core customer will eventually lose them.

4) Blaming External Factors Instead of Owning Failures

For 10 years, AAP blamed the Centre, the LG, and opposition parties for everything.

The “victim card” was effective in the early years but wore thin by 2025—voters expected governance, not excuses.

BJP flipped this weakness into an advantage, promising that with a BJP-led government, there would be no Centre-state conflicts, leading to “seamless governance.”

The narrative changed from “AAP vs. BJP” to “AAP vs. Results.” Lesson? Leaders who constantly shift blame instead of delivering solutions lose credibility.

5) Strategic Missteps and Lack of Political Alliances

AAP contested separately from Congress, which led to a split in the anti-BJP vote.

Rahul Gandhi’s direct attacks on Kejriwal made matters worse—AAP was getting hit from both sides.

Internal conflicts weakened the party further. Atishi and Saurabh Bharadwaj were seen as Kejriwal’s successors, but there was no clear transition strategy.

BJP: A Masterclass in Strategic Adaptation

BJP’s 2025 win in Delhi was not a Modi-centric sweep but a well-calibrated organizational comeback. After a lackluster 2024 Lok Sabha performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader.

performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader. Unlike AAP, BJP adapted, restructured, and executed flawlessly.

1) Moving Beyond Modi Dependency

BJP understood that Delhi’s electorate needed a more localized approach.

Instead of making the election about Modi, it focused on governance, urban issues, and direct voter engagement.

No CM face? It didn’t matter. The party projected collective leadership instead of relying on one individual.

By decentralizing its campaign, BJP looked more stable and future-ready.

2) Adopting AAP’s Own Strategies Against It

BJP neutralized AAP’s welfare advantage—promising free electricity, continued subsidies, and additional financial support for women.

Middle-class tax reliefs were announced just before the elections, ensuring they won over voters that AAP had neglected.

The manifesto focused on real urban issues—pollution control, traffic congestion, and infrastructure—exactly what AAP had failed to address convincingly.

Lesson? The best way to beat a competitor is to adopt their strengths while exposing their weaknesses.

3) Letting Congress Do The Attacking



BJP didn’t need to attack AAP aggressively—Rahul Gandhi and Congress did that for them.

By letting AAP and Congress fight it out, BJP consolidated its voter base while the opposition split.

AAP’s credibility suffered more because the attacks came from within the anti-BJP camp.

A strategic win, without unnecessary effort.

4) A Disciplined, Focused, and Well-Executed Campaign

BJP stayed on message, focusing on corruption, governance, and economic stability.

The campaign was structured and well-planned, unlike AAP’s which seemed reactive and disorganized.

The promise to investigate AAP’s corruption cases resonated with voters, reinforcing BJP’s stance on accountability.

In business terms? BJP had a clear marketing strategy, strong brand positioning, and flawless execution.

5) Final Takeaways

Adaptability is key. BJP recalibrated after its 2024 Lok Sabha setbacks, while AAP remained stagnant.

Brand trust is fragile. AAP built its image on honesty but lost credibility due to scandals and mismanagement.

Execution matters more than rhetoric. BJP delivered a disciplined, well-structured campaign.

Leadership succession planning is critical. AAP failed to build second-line leadership, while BJP showcased organizational depth.

Voters reward governance, not excuses. After a decade in power, AAP’s blame game no longer worked.

Politics, like business, rewards those who adapt, execute, and deliver.

Ah, another election, another flood of LinkedIn wisdom posts—where every poll result is a ""case study,"" every political leader is a ""CEO,"" and every campaign is an ""MBA-level lesson in leadership."" Some call it democracy, but on LinkedIn, it’s all about business jargon and corporate analogies.So, let’s break this down the LinkedIn way.BJP, on the other hand, had a structured, disciplined campaign with clear messaging and no internal rifts. In politics and business, a divided team rarely wins.","AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach.

Ten years of incumbency

Liquor scam, Sheesh Mahal dent Kejriwal's 'imandaar' image

No tie-up, Congress did strategic campaigning

Flood of freebies but no next-level of development

BJP focuses on Kejriwal, Hindutva takes back seat

BJP's latent vote

Rahul roasted Kejriwal as payback for Haryana

MCD with AAP: No excuses

Steady exodus of AAP leaders

AAP goes negative

The BJP on Saturday pulled off a major political upset by unseating the Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ) from Delhi after over 10 years. As per the latest Election Commission data, the BJP may win around 48 seats and the Kejriwal-led party may secure around 22 seats in the 70-seat Assembly.BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in a fierce contest from the New Delhi seat by a margin of 4,089 votes. Verma, 47, bagged 30,088 votes, while Kejriwal and Congress' Sandeep Dikshit got 25,999 votes and 4,568 votes.Kejriwal conceded his defeat and hoped that the BJP will fulfill all its promises.""We accept the mandate of the people with great humility. I congratulate the BJP for this victory and I hope they will fulfil all the promises for which people have voted for them,"" Kejriwal said in a video address posted on X.In the evening as the results were decalred, PM Modi kicked off his victory speech with a powerful chant of ""Yamuna Maiya ki Jai"". PM Modi declared that the people of Delhi were experiencing both relief and joy -- relief from the ""disaster"" (AAP-da governance) and joy in embracing a new era under BJP rule. ""I had written a letter to every Delhi resident, urging them to give the BJP a chance to serve in the 21st century...Today, I bow my head in gratitude to every family in Delhi for trusting us. You have given us love with an open heart, and I assure you that we will return it manifold through rapid development,"" PM Modi said.The Prime Minister also attacked the AAP over allegations of corruption against its leaders, saying that all links of such charges will be probed and those who ""looted"" money will have to return it.With the BJP set to regain control of Delhi after 27 years, what went wrong for the Aam Aadmi Party?After governing Delhi for a decade, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) faced significant anti-incumbency.While AAP achieved impressive results in health and education during its first two terms, and kept voters happy with power and water subsidies, unfulfilled promises, such as improved air quality, became major poll issues.The AAP's assertion that the BJP government at the Centre was creating roadblocks in its functioning began to be increasingly seen by voters as excuses, especially after ten years in power.The BJP's ""double engine"" promise, suggesting seamless governance between the central and state levels, appealed to voters against the backdrop of AAP's constant conflicts with the Centre. Furthermore, internal disarray within the AAP, with senior leaders facing jail time, added to the challenges of incumbency .The image of Arvind Kejriwal as an anti-corruption crusader suffered a setback due to several factors, most notably the controversy surrounding the now-scrapped liquor policy.The BJP accused the AAP government of turning Delhi into a ""city of drunkards"" with the new policy, and receiving crores in kickbacks from those who opened the vends.Probes by central agencies led to the arrest of top AAP leaders, including Arvind Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia, and Sanjay Singh. These arrests forced Sisodia to step down as deputy chief minister and kept the AAP in ""firefighting mode"", distracting from fulfilling its 2020 poll promises.Additionally, the ""Sheesh Mahal"" controversy, referring to the renovated residence of the chief minister, further dented Kejriwal's image. The BJP further highlighted a Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) report that indicated the renovation cost had increased from an initial estimate of Rs 7.91 crore to Rs 33.66 crore by completion.AAP has been synonymous with Arvind Kejriwal since its inception. Kejriwal, initially seen as an agent of change with his untucked shirt and no-nonsense demeanor, resonated with the common person.However, the anti-corruption image of Kejriwal and his party suffered irreparable damage, specially after the AAP leader's arrest in March 2024 on corruption allegations and his subsequent resignation as CM.While he was later granted bail, the leadership transition to Atishi and the circumstances surrounding Kejriwal's arrest damaged the party's image and cohesion.The absence of an alliance with the Congress party and the Congress's strategic campaigning likely contributed to the AAP's loss.In previous elections, the AAP had significantly reduced the Congress's presence in the Delhi assembly.Attempts to convince Congress workers to collaborate with AAP volunteers reportedly led to an ""existential crisis"" among them.The Congress decided to campaign aggressively against the AAP, sensing ""anger building up against the AAP"". Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra attacked the AAP in the final days of the Delhi campaign.The Congress further claimed the AAP did not want an alliance, with Kejriwal announcing all 70 candidates early on.The rise of AAP in Delhi has been congruous with the decline of the Congress. In 2013, AAP won 28 seats with a 29.49% vote share, while the Congress tally decreased to 8 seats from 43 in 2008. In 2015, Congress suffered a 15% decline in its vote share, while the AAP saw its support base rise by around 15%.While AAP's welfare schemes, such as free electricity and bus travel for women, initially garnered support, a lack of focus on infrastructure development and maintenance became a significant issue.The poor condition of roads and sewers across Delhi angered voters.Overflowing drains, potholed roads, and irregular garbage collection contributed to the party's unpopularity.The AAP's control over the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) meant it could not deflect blame for these issues onto the BJP. Voters in middle- and upper-middle-class areas were particularly affected by the deteriorating infrastructure.AAP's origins trace back to Anna Hazare’s anti-corruption movement, positioning the party as an alternative to the Congress in 2013.While AAP secured mandates in 2015 and 2020, their repeated promises and ""freebies"" seem to have lost their appeal.The promise of piped water connections for all in 2015 remains unfulfilled, as does the promise of full statehood for Delhi and the ""Rozgar Budget"" aimed at creating 20 lakh jobs.Kejriwal himself admitted that he had failed to fulfill three promises: cleaning the Yamuna, providing clean drinking water, and upgrading Delhi's roads. This acknowledgment gave the BJP an opportunity to attack the AAP, with Amit Shah mocking Kejriwal's promise to purify the Yamuna.The BJP's campaign strategy focused primarily on targeting Arvind Kejriwal and his government, rather than emphasising Hindutva, as it has often done during campainging in other state elections as well as previous Delhi polls.This approach likely resonated with a broader segment of the population, including those who may not have been inclined to support a religiously charged campaign. By focusing on issues such as corruption and governance, the BJP effectively undermined AAP's credibility and appealed to a wider range of voters.The BJP also focused on hyper-local issues such as air pollution, traffic, and public safety, and engaged with local Resident Welfare Associations. They also promoted central government schemes.The BJP also targeted specific demographics, including Purvanchalis and slum dwellers, and utilised an aggressive digital campaign with AI-enhanced content and memes targeting AAP.The BJP's consistent performance in the Lok Sabha polls in Delhi indicated a latent voter base that the party successfully mobilised this time around for the assembly elections.Despite AAP's strong performance in the assembly elections, the BJP had consistently swept Lok Sabha elections in the national capital, winning all seven seats.This pre-existing support base provided a foundation for the BJP's campaign and likely contributed to their victory.The BJP also strategically fielded Parvesh Verma, a strong Jat leader, in the New Delhi constituency, signaling their intention to win back the confidence of the Jat community, which had previously favoured AAP in Delhi elections.During the Delhi Assembly elections, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi launched strong criticisms against Arvind Kejriwal, which may have been payback for events in Haryana. Gandhi's attacks covered a range of issues, including alleged corruption, unfulfilled promises, and inaction on key issues.Like the BJP, Gandhi attacked Kejriwal over the alleged liquor scam and accused him of living in a ""Sheesh Mahal"" while engaging in corrupt practices.Gandhi said that Kejriwal made false promises, ""similar to Prime Minister Narendra Modi"", particularly regarding cleaning the Yamuna River. He also challenged Kejriwal to drink Delhi's tap water, implying it was still polluted despite promises to clean it.The Aam Aadmi Party's (AAP) win in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) in 2022 proved to be a double-edged sword, ultimately hurting the party instead of helping it. AAP had promised a cleaner city with world-class roads, but it fell short on both accounts. The MCD House was in limbo, and the Standing Committee, which controls all financial powers, was never formed. The AAP repeatedly accused the Centre of creating hurdles through the Lieutenant Governor and stalling projects.This time around, voters held the AAP accountable for the deteriorating civic infrastructure across Delhi.AAP's performance in the MCD was a letdown for the people of Delhi. The party failed to address critical issues such as clearing garbage, repairing roads, and cleaning clogged sewers. Erratic water supply and overflowing sewers that were never repaired because Rs 4,000 crore for the Delhi Jal Board was not released further hurt the party.Senior party leaders stated that the MCD functioning had collapsed under the AAP, and no work was being done, leading to frustration among councillors.The steady departure of senior leaders from AAP over time might have also weakened the party's organisational structure and public image.The exit of prominent figures like Prashant Bhushan, Yogendra Yadav, Mayank Gandhi, and Kumar Vishwas, who had dared to disagree with Arvind Kejriwal, and repeatedly accused Kejriwal of having an ""autocratic"" style of leadership.Resignation of senior leaders like Kailash Gahlot, who cited the party's focus on political agenda over fulfilling promises, along with internal challenges, signalled internal discord.The BJP had termed Gahlot's resignation a ""courageous move"".Negative campaigning by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) centered on issues like Yamuna River pollution, the Delhi Police, and the Election Commission (EC) may have affected public perception of the AAP government.In the lead up to the polls, Kejriwal accused the BJP-led Haryana government of poisoning the Yamuna River, which supplies drinking water to Delhi. He claimed that the Haryana government deliberately sent polluted waters to Delhi to create an artificial water scarcity and blame the AAP.The AAP also repeatedly levelled accusations of voter fraud and irregularities against the BJP as well as the EC.AAP alleged that the Election Commission and Delhi Police were shielding BJP workers and accused them of ""hooliganism"". Kejriwal wrote to the Chief Election Commissioner, expressing concern over the intimidation and harassment of AAP volunteers by BJP workers. The EC responded that no written complaints could be traced in most cases but assured that all registered complaints are investigated.Kejriwal further criticised the Election Commission for allegedly refusing to make Form 17C public, a document detailing the number of votes polled at each booth. AAP then launched a website, transparentelections.in, claiming to upload Form 17C data for all constituencies to present the data in an accessible format.The EC dismissed Kejriwal's claims regarding Form 17C, stating that copies had already been provided to polling agents at each booth after voting, as per Rule 49S of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961.","BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. Verma, 47, bagged 30,088 votes, while Kejriwal and Congress' Sandeep Dikshit got 25,999 votes and 4,568 votes. Kejriwal conceded his defeat and hoped that the BJP will fulfill all its promises.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118065596,imgsize-587609,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/118065596.jpg"

Fugitive businessman Mehul Choksi living in Belgium: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/fugitive-businessman-mehul-choksi-living-in-belgium-report/articleshow/119362229.cms,"<p>Mehul Choksi<br></p>

NEW DELHI: Fugitive businessman Mehul Choksi is reportedly living in Belgium's Antwerp with his wife, Preeti Choksi, after securing an ‘F Residency Card’ in the country, according to a media report.Indian authorities have reportedly urged Belgium to initiate his extradition to India after knowing his whereabouts, the Associated Times reported.Choksi, accused of defrauding Punjab National Bank of over Rs 13,000 crore, obtained residency in Belgium and secured an 'F Residency Card' on November 15, 2023, reportedly facilitated by his wife, a citizen of Belgium. According to the Carribean-focused media outlet, Choksi had fabricated his documents to Belgian authorities and misrepresented his nationality in his application process, failing to disclose the details of his existing citizenship.It is believed that Choksi was believed to be living in Antigua and Barbuda before travelling to Belgium and is planning to move to Switzerland.The matter came days after Antigua and Barbuda’s Foreign Minister EP Chet Greene said that Choksi is no longer on the island.Greene, who was invited to participate in the Raisina Dialogue, did not reveal where Choksi had gone and noted, “Mehul Choksi is not on the island. I am told he left Antigua for medical attention abroad (but) he remains a citizen of Antigua and Barbuda. The governments, yours (India) and mine, are working together on this matter.”Choksi departed from India in January 2018 after being implicated in the PNB case. His nephew, Nirav Modi, was also implicated and currently awaits extradition proceedings in London.In May 2023, Choksi informed a Mumbai special court that circumstances beyond his control prevented his return to India, contesting the label of 'fugitive economic offender'. He claims he did not leave to avoid prosecution and is not refusing to return, adding that Indian authorities suspended his passport.The ED approached the special court seeking to designate him as a 'fugitive economic offender' for avoiding their summons and to enable confiscation of his assets under applicable legislation.In May 2021, his disappearance from Antigua led to speculation about abduction by Indian authorities - claims disproven when he was located in Dominica. Some suggested he attempted to avoid potential extradition.Dominican authorities arrested him for unlawful entry, but he returned to Antigua on medical grounds with interim bail. The proceedings were halted in May 2022.Choksi disputed the illegal entry allegations, stating that individuals posing as police officers took him from his restaurant, Jolly Roger in Antigua, to Dominica by boat.In December 2023, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman informed Parliament that assets valued at Rs 22,280 crore had been recovered or liquidated to settle debts of wanted persons including Choksi.","Indian authorities have reportedly urged Belgium to initiate his extradition to India.
