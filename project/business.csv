NEW DELHI: External affairs minister (EAM) S Jaishankar stressed the increasing significance of Indian skills and talent on a global scale. He noted that developed nations are now expressing interest in forging mobility agreements with India, highlighting a shift in the way the world views Indian expertise.He also underscored the pivotal role of Indian capabilities in the knowledge economy , emphasizing the growing demand driven by technological advancements.Addressing the CII Annual Business Summit 2024 in New Delhi, he said, ""In the era of a knowledge economy, the role of Indian skills and talent is also being reassessed. The nature of technological advancement is itself creating greater demand. But there is also the reality of demographic shortages in developed countries. These trends are manifesting themselves right now in an interest across the world to conclude mobility agreements with India.""""On our part, we too would like to see that our talent is treated fairly and transparently. As a global workplace emerges - and believe me, it will grow faster than all of us anticipate. As a global workplace emerges - there are some immediate consequences. Expanding the scale and quality of skilling at home becomes an even more urgent imperative. This is very much in line with the Modi Government's thinking. They are supported by the spread of the innovation and start-up culture as well. Businesses too need to do their fair share in the upgrading of our human resources,"" he added.Reiterating the government's responsibility to protect Indian citizens worldwide, the EAM pointed out successful missions conducted to bring back Indian citizens from Ukraine and Sudan,He also said the government intends to establish India as a leading center for innovation, research, and design.""As the global workplace expands, the obligation to secure our citizens abroad will also grow proportionately. Fortunately, this is an area where we have already built capabilities and created SOPs, as evidenced recently in Ukraine and in Sudan. We are also deploying technology more widely for the ease of living of Indians traveling and working abroad,"" he said.""However, as we contemplate the relevance of our talent with the importance of 'Make in India,' our goal is to make ourselves into a global hub for innovation, research, and design as well. 'Work in India' is the natural outcome, I would say, a supportive basis for 'Make In India.' But it will also have 'Work for the World' as its subset,"" he added.Underscoring the crisis engulfing across the world due to the ongoing wars in Ukraine and Gaza, he said that the world is experiencing a 3F crisis of fuel, food, and fertilizers, in which India is acting with the judicious combination of ""Bharat First' and ""Vasudaiva Kutumbakam.""""Instead today, what is the reality we are staring at? A Ukraine conflict now in its third year. A huge escalation of violence in West Asia/the Middle East that could spread beyond. The disruption of logistics due to war, due to sanctions, drone attacks, and climate events. The world is experiencing a 3F crisis of fuel, food, and fertilizers. In Asia, new tensions have emerged in land and sea as agreements are dishonored and the rule of law disregarded,"" he said.""Terrorism and extremism have started to consume those who have long practiced it. In many ways, we are actually going through the perfect storm. For India, the task is to mitigate its impact on itself and contribute to stabilizing the world to the extent possible. It is this judicious combination of 'Bharat First' and 'Vasudaiva Kutumbakam' that defines our image as 'Vishwa Bandhu,'"" he added.",S Jaishankar stressed the increasing significance of Indian skills and talent on a global scale. He noted that developed nations are now expressing interest in forging mobility agreements with India. He also underscored the pivotal role of Indian capabilities in the knowledge economy.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110222437,imgsize-32786,width-400,resizemode-4/110222437.jpg"

Justice Bopanna has an understudied elegance that sits well with his high standard of integrity, proficiency and diligence,” he said.The tall and handsome Justice Bopanna wore a disarming smile as attorney general R Venkataramani, solicitor general Tushar Mehta, leaders of the bar associations and CJI D Y Chandrachud sang paeans for the man who entered the constitutional court as a judge of Karnataka HC in Jan 2006 and scheduled to retire on May 19 during the summer break of SC.Newly elected SCBA president Kapil Sibal said, “When we learn that our case is listed before a bench headed by Justice Bopanna, we feel very relaxed as he displayed serenity and generosity in abundance coupled with abundant patience. No lawyer went unhappy from his court, irrespective of the outcome in the case argued.”Mehta said Justice Bopanna’s subtle humour kept tempers in control in the courtroom even in hotly contested cases. Senior advocate C S Vaidyanathan said if the Collegium wants to set a benchmark for selection of judges to constitutional courts, then it should list out the qualities possessed by Justice Bopanna.Senior advocate Anitha Shenoy termed him as the ‘ideal judge’ while senior advocate Sidharth Dave said an unofficial poll among lawyers ranked Justice Bopanna as the most popular judge in the SC.SCAORA president Vipin Nair said Justice Bopanna is the first SC judge from Coorg, which produced two celebrated army generals Cariappa and Thimayya. “The man of peace and calmness inspired litigants’ faith in the system as his courtroom was like Buddha’s Garden, serene and calm. No advocate raised his voice in his courtroom.”",Justice Ajjikuttira Somaiah Bopanna on Thursday was unequivocally adjudged by lawyers as the calmest judge possessing an ‘understudied elegance’ His characteristics could be the benchmark for selecting judges to the constitutional courts.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110222362,imgsize-1020832,width-400,resizemode-4/110222362.jpg"

Lok Sabha polls: City residents ready with their new wishlist,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lok-sabha-polls-city-residents-ready-with-their-new-wishlist/articleshow/110221747.cms,"The state capital has developed rapidly with the implementation of several infrastructure projects in the past 10 years, but with many demands still pending, people want their representative in the Lok Sabha to address them.One such long pending demand includes sanctioning of a bridge over the Gomti to connect Mahdi Ghat in Husainabad with the city centre.Citing inconvenience due to the current damaged platoon bridge, the residents have been demanding a bridge in the area for a long time.Citizens have also been raising concern over the rise in pollution and deterioration of the state of Gomti. There is also demand for the expansion of Metro and breastfeeding public spaces.“We have to travel around 5-7 km extra to reach the main areas of the city. We have been raising the issues for two decades, but it’s still to be addressed by the authorities,” said Pervez Ahmad, a resident of Faizullahganj.“My father used to catch fish in Gomti, and people would take baths in it. Now it seems that our lifeline will die in the next 10 years. We, the fishermen living on Kudiya Ghat, demand that efforts should be made to revive Gomti as soon as possible,” said Ram Gopal, a fisherman at Kudiya Ghat.Shivansh Shamra, a resident of Dubagga, said, “We have been hearing that there will be a flyover constructed at the Dubagga crossing for years, but the construction of the flyover is yet to be started.”Residents of Daudnagar, Aashiana, Park Road, Martinpurwa, and nearby areas, complain about the lack of proper drainage, leading to waterlogging throughout the year. They further claimed that as the area is low-lying, there is an urgent need for a proper drainage system .“The drainage facilities in these areas are old and are not equipped to tackle drainage as the population and construction are growing. We urge the urban planning department of the central government to look into the issue,” said Manoj Kumar.Many feel that flyovers and underpasses at Awadh Crossing in Alambagh will help tackle traffic in these areas. Residents like Asha Verma, an employee of a private company, said, “There are always traffic jams at the crossing. There should be a flyover to reduce the traffic congestion.”A shop owner near the crossing, Satnam Singh, echoed, “There is always a jam-like situation throughout the day that affects our businesses. We have been demanding a flyover or any concrete solution for decades, but our problem has never been addressed.”The residents of Gomtinagar demanded the expansion of the metro rail network to their locality. “As a prominent and upscale area within the city, Gomtinagar deserves efficient and sustainable transportation options that align with its status and growing population,” Pallavi Singh from Vikrant Khand said. “Public spaces must have breastfeeding centres. Like the govt focused on making toilets available for all, this issue should be dealt with sensitivity,” said Ridhima Singh, a resident of Chowk.",Citizens have been raising concern over the rise in pollution and deterioration of the state of Gomti.

The announcement regarding the procurement of electric buses has been pending for the past three years, he said. “The welfare & concessions of the DMK Govt comes at a cost. There is no place in the world where each Minister takes turns belittling a beneficiary as a “Freeloader”, like in TN under the DMK Government,” he said.","K Annamalai questioned the state govt’s decision to award Rs 1,000crore contract to procure equipment for smart classrooms for govt schools to Keltron.

"Indian seafarers are the most abandoned in the world again, union stats show",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indian-seafarers-are-the-most-abandoned-in-the-world-again-union-stats-show/articleshow/110217386.cms,"LONDON: Indians are set to be the most abandoned seafarers for a second year running, with 411 Indian seafarers already having been abandoned on ships in less than six months.A total of 116 vessels and 1,672 seafarers have been abandoned so far this year, meaning the International Transport Workers’ Federation ( ITF )is on course to record an even higher number of abandoned vessels than 2023 when there were 129 vessels and 1,983 seafarers abandoned, the highest on record; of the seafarers, 401 were Indian.ITF, headquartered in London, has shared images of 16 Indian seafarers abandoned on board two vessels in the UAE, operated by the same company, UAE-based AIM Global Shipping & Fuel Supply, where they have been for months without pay, no air-conditioning and low on provisions.Six are on board “Seashine 7”, which anchored at Sharjah. They are owed more than $40,000 in unpaid wages.Ten Indians are on board “Sunshine 7”, where they are owed $35,000. It has a Tanzania flag and was deregistered in September 2022. On this ship there is no air-conditioning or refrigeration and the generator is turned on for one hour per day. The crews are sleeping on deck because it’s too hot in the cabins. ITF is currently in dialogue with the owner of the vessels.Of the 116 vessels abandoned so far this year, 75% are flying under so-called flags of convenience (FOC). “Seashine 7” was registeredas a FOC with Palau and Tanzania has also been designated an FOC by the ITF. This is when ships fly a flag of a country other than the country of ownership to avoid being subjected to labour and tax regulations, and some do it to bypass sanctions. The latest additions to ITF’s FOC registry are Gabon and Eswatini (formerly Swaziland), both in Africa. Eswatini is a landlocked state and not a member of the international maritime organisation. Gabon saw a 675% increase in its registry in the two years after Russia invaded Ukraine.ITF president Paddy Crumlin said: “The business case is based on registering in country where there is no accountability and no regulation. We are hearing cases of abandonment, death, exploitation and failure to pay wages. FOC countries don’t have the capacity to regulate,and all they want to do is attract revenues.”“Indian crewing agents are among the worst for sending seafarers just to be abandoned,” said ITF inspectorate coordinator Steve Trowsdale.National Union of Seafarers of India vice-president Louis Gomes said Indians taking up such jobs “often have no awareness and don’t even know to which ship they are going. Some pay just to get on board a ship to get a period of service to get certificates.”","A total of 116 vessels and 1,672 seafarers have been abandoned so far this year. 16 Indian seafarers abandoned on board two vessels in the UAE, where they have been for months without pay, no air-conditioning and low on provisions.

Inspector M D Patel, who led the sting operation, explained that they convinced a farmer to act as the decoy. ""Nakum has been the VCE since 2013.For each document, the applicant would pay Rs 5 - Rs 3 would be Nakum's commission while Rs 2 went to the govt. His job was to provide land revenue documents and ownership letters to farmers,"" said Patel.However, several people approached the ACB, alleging that Nakum charged them Rs 10 per document and pocketed Rs 5. Following this, the ACB set a trap for Nakum.Nakum has now been booked under the provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act, and an investigation is underway.Shamsher Singh, DGP (law and order) and director of ACB Gujarat said, ""While the bribe amount is small, it represents an effort to stop everyday corrupt practices in rural areas.

In percentage terms among the top five countries, India saw the second highest increase in applications after China, followed by Morocco and Turkey, according to the European Commission. In spite of the surge, unavailability of visa interview slots tripped many Indians' travel plans.Russia and China have had a story of fluctuating fortunes. While China, which started opening its borders for international travel only last year and had huge pent-up demand, leapt to the top of table from rank 22 in 2022. It saw the highest increase at 1,104% - over 10 times - in 2023 over the 2022 application numbers. (See box).Russia, on the other hand, slipped from rank 2 in 2022 to rank 5 in 2023 mainly due to the war on Ukraine, and the ensuing sanctions. Russians' Schengen visa applications fell 25% in this two-year span.For India, travel veterans believe the actual demand is even higher than official figures. But the unavailability of visa interview slots meant many Indians who wanted to travel could not even get a chance to apply for Schengen visas. ""Appointments are simply not available with a majority of Schengen countries. If you want to travel to Europe this summer, the earliest appointment date for Germany and Italy is in July. This is making life very difficult for travellers. Rules require people to apply to the consulate of the country which will be their primary destination in Europe. But people are forced to opt for any country that has an appointment available for a visa in time,"" said Anil Kalsi, VP, Travel Agents Federation of India.Many agents have vented their ire at VFSon multiple countsmany times, including that the agency handles far too many nations. Applying for a Schengen visa requires prior flight and hotel bookings, and not getting a visa in time means bearing huge cancellation charges.In response to the complaints, a VFS Global spokesperson said: ""Visa decision timelines are entirely at the discretion of the respective embassies/consulates... We urge travellers to plan travel early to avoid last-minute surprises. Most countries accept visa applications up to 90 days (3 months) before date of travel."" According to the revised Schengen Visa Code, effective Feb 2, 2020, you can apply for a Schengen visa up to 6 months before your date of travel."" Another bugbear is the EU policy of issuing very short term visas till recently to frequent visitors, something that was changed a few days back.This means frequent travelers have had to apply time and again till recently.","Schengen countries saw the third highest demand for visas in India last year in absolute terms at 9.7 lakh applications.

Additionally, an assortment of stone relics, a stone temple plinth, ornamented and unornamented stone fallen relics, iron clamp, and charcoal have been unearthed from the site.“The stone architectural elements and sculptures recovered span several periods, commencing with the Salasthambha period (655 CE-900 CE), followed by the Pala period (9th C–11th C), and culminating with the Ahom masonry (1228 CE–1826 CE),” Nabajit Deori (deputy director, administration & monument) at the state directorate of archaeology told TOI.The excavation is being meticulously carried out by a team of archaeologists, including Nabajit Deori, Chabina Hassan (deputy director, exploration & excavation, events), Simran Sambhi (exploration officer), and Priyanka Patir (exploration officer), under the astute guidance of Deepi Rekha Kouli, director of the directorate of archaeology, Assam. The team also comprises Mousumi Mitra (archaeologist), Rumi Sarma (research assistant), Yang Jerang (research assistant), Hari Sing R Das (technical assistant), Rashmi Deori (junior technical assistant) and Bhargav Duarah (photographer).The temple, constructed during the reign of the Salasthambha dynasty, is a magnificent pancharatha design featuring a combination of bricks and stones, the researchers said. It boasts an antarala and a mandapa of do-cala shape, with the entire complex enclosed within a brick boundary wall with its alignment in east-west direction.A cluster of modern bricks, utilised as a foundation support for the modern construction, has been observed, with the modern foundation bricks aligned parallel to the ancient bricks.The excavation has unveiled an extended mandapa in front of the present brick-built mandapa of the Ahom period. Adjacent to the extended mandapa, a brick plinth with a small stone pranala is also exposed. Furthermore, a separate plinth of stone exhibiting an offset design has been uncovered. “The most significant aspect of the excavation is the occurrence of art and architectural parts of different time frame,” Deori added.The excavation is an ongoing endeavour, and the directorate has collected artefacts such as iron clamps, brick samples of varying sizes, and potsherds for carbon dating and OSL (optically stimulated luminescence) dating. “The culmination of the excavation at Gupteshwar is expected to shed light on the archaeological wealth of the area in chronological order,” Deori said.","Gupteswar Devalaya is a living temple situated at Singri in northern Assam’s Sonitpur district.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner.

Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

The G7 industrial democracies are the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada.Yellen had previously pushed for full confiscation of the largely euro-denominated assets, but Europe has balked, opting instead for a more conservative plan to put the earnings -- estimated at around $3.5 billion per year -- into a fund for Ukraine.Since then, the US has proposed a plan to bring forward the interest on the assets to back a bond or a loan that would provide Ukraine perhaps $50 billion in the near term as it battles increasing Russian military pressure in its east and north.The US official said there was a unified goal among the G7 officials to provide more money to Ukraine, and to demonstrate to Russian President Vladimir Putin that he cannot simply ""wait out our coalition.""""What we are involved in is trying to engage in hard, detailed economic diplomacy to make sure we can all get on the same page.

US taxpayers money used for controversial virus research in Wuhan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-taxpayers-money-used-for-controversial-virus-research-in-wuhan/articleshow/110214383.cms,"NEW DELHI: National Institutes of Health (NIH) principal deputy director Lawrence Tabak admitted to Congress on Thursday that US taxpayers funded gain-of-function research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China prior to the Covid-19 pandemic.Rep Debbie Lesko (R-Ariz) of the select subcommittee on the coronavirus pandemic questioned Dr Tabak, asking, “Did NIH fund gain-of-function research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology through [Manhattan-based nonprofit] EcoHealth [Alliance]?” Tabak replied, “If you’re speaking about the generic term, yes, we did.”This admission comes after more than four years of evasions from federal public health officials, including Tabak himself and former National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) director Dr Anthony Fauci, regarding the controversial research practice that modifies viruses to make them more infectious.Tabak clarified that this type of research is widespread and poses no threat or harm, which is why it is not regulated, a New York Post report said.Dr Bryce Nickels, a genetics professor at Rutgers University, criticized Tabak's response, describing it as “obfuscation and semantic manipulation.” He accused the NIH official of resisting accountability for risky research that could create pathogens of pandemic potential.In July 2023, the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) barred the Wuhan Institute of Virology from receiving federal grants for the next 10 years. Additionally, EcoHealth Alliance , which had its funding pulled by HHS for the next three years, has faced scrutiny for its involvement in the research.Tabak previously acknowledged in an October 2021 letter to Congress that NIH funded a ""limited experiment"" at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which tested whether spike proteins from naturally occurring bat coronaviruses could bind to the human ACE2 receptor in a mouse model. This experiment, which involved modifying bat coronaviruses with SARS and MERS viruses, was not described as gain-of-function research, despite EcoHealth's failure to report that the modified viruses became 10,000 times more infectious, violating grant terms.Despite repeated denials by Dr Anthony Fauci, Republicans have consistently challenged the NIH's involvement in gain-of-function research. Sen Rand Paul (R-Ky) notably grilled Fauci in several hearings, demanding clarity on the NIH's funding practices.The House subcommittee continues to investigate whether Covid-19 accidentally leaked from a lab in Wuhan, which several US intelligence agencies and experts have suggested as the most likely cause of the pandemic. Dr. Robert Redfield, former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and former Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe have both supported this theory.Nickels concluded that the hearing underscored the lack of oversight for scientific research on pathogens, highlighting the need for stricter controls and accountability to prevent future pandemics.Dr Fauci is scheduled to testify about gain-of-function research and the origins of the pandemic in a public subcommittee hearing on June 3.","National Institutes of Health (NIH) principal deputy director Lawrence Tabak admitted to Congress on Thursday that US taxpayers funded gain-of-function research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China.

$12.5 billion pledge: How Melinda French Gates may change the game of billionaire philanthropy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/12-5-billion-pledge-how-melinda-french-gates-may-change-the-game-of-billionaire-philanthropy/articleshow/110213600.cms,"Pivotal ventures

MacKenzie model

After her divorce from Jeff Bezos in 2019, MacKenzie Scott changed the game of billionaire philanthropy , writing huge checks to small charities at a breakneck pace from her newly independent $36 billion fortune.Now, the philanthropy world is hoping for another seismic shift from Melinda French Gates , who’s armed with $12.5 billion to deploy for her own charity work independent of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.French Gates will get that vast sum directly from her ex-husband, Microsoft Corp co-founder Bill Gates , after leaving the Gates Foundation next month. It’s still not clear when or in what form she’ll receive those billions, and representatives for French Gates declined to elaborate.But that hasn’t slowed the speculation.“I’m excited,” said Latanya Mapp, chief executive officer of Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors. “She’s a good friend of MacKenzie, so all we can hope for is more of that kind of thinking, like we trust our partners. We know how little goes to domestic grassroots women’s organizations.”French Gates, 59, spent more than two decades helping build the Gates Foundation — which will change its name after she leaves in June — into one of the biggest and most influential charities in the world. In 2024 alone, the foundation’s budget is $8.6 billion, dispersing money to its 42 program strategies, including global health and gender issues, which is French Gates’ flagship cause.Mapp said she suspects French Gates only stayed at the Gates Foundation for three years after the couple’s 2021 divorce because she wanted to expand its gender program. Soon after announcing their divorce, the Gateses said they were committing $2.1 billion to advance gender equality.French Gates helped build up “real infrastructure and a place for gender there,” Mapp said. “I don’t think this was an ‘I woke up this weekend and I decided to leave’ kind of decision.”In 2015, French Gates started a charitable limited liability company called Pivotal Ventures, which uses grants as well as venture capital to focus on empowering women, including getting more females into technology jobs and elected to public office. Pivotal has committed $1 billion to “expanding women’s power and influence” in the US, according to its website.Some see French Gates taking a more political turn after the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade. In her note on X announcing her departure, she wrote, “This is a critical moment for women and girls in the US and around the world — and those fighting to protect and advance equality are in urgent need of support.”Ben Soskis, senior research associate at the Urban Institute, said French Gates possibly wants to focus her energy on Pivotal because of its form. An LLC “has more freedom to give to politics and to make for-profit investments than does a private foundation,” said Soskis, who has received Gates Foundation funding.In 2022, French Gates started an offshoot called Pivotal Philanthropies Foundation with $626 million in assets. A spokesperson for Pivotal said the foundation form “gives [French Gates] the ability to support more organizations aligned with Pivotal’s mission to advance social progress.”To put the scale of French Gates’s new power into context, her foundation — if starting from scratch with $12.5 billion — would be the sixth-largest in the US, according to Elizabeth Dale, associate professor of public affairs and nonprofit leadership at Seattle University.The Pivotal foundation made $8.8 million in grants in 2022, including $500,000 to Me Too International to “strengthen the capacity of a global and survivor-led movement against sexual violence,” and $75,000 to Neo Philanthropy Inc. to “raise public awareness for women of color transforming democracy.” The biggest grants were $2 million — a small amount compared with the tens of millions of dollars Scott sometimes gives at a time. One of the groups that received $2 million was Allied Media Projects, to support the Decolonizing Wealth Project, “a racial equity education program.”Edgar Villanueva, CEO of the Decolonizing Wealth Project, said the way Pivotal does its funding is closer to the MacKenzie Scott model. While Scott is prone to catch nonprofits by surprise with huge checks and little in the way of reporting requirements or spending restrictions, the Gates Foundation is known to be more bureaucratic, he said.“Gates can be very rigid and require a lot from grantees in terms of reporting and data,” Villanueva said. “Pivotal has really been more of the model of a co-investor, taking bets on communities and not requiring the most in terms of reporting.”French Gates and Scott, 54, have worked together before. In 2020 they partnered on the Equality Can’t Wait Challenge, which made calls for pitches on how organizations should spend $10 million to speed up women’s empowerment. The pair, along with other partners, are now funding the initial $45 million for construction of a parks improvement plan in Seattle.Scott, who didn’t respond to a request for comment, has a fortune of $38.5 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

US proposes reclassifying marijuana as low-risk drug,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-proposes-reclassifying-marijuana-as-low-risk-drug/articleshow/110194549.cms,"NEW DELHI: Biden administration on Thursday officially proposed to reclassify marijuana as a less dangerous drug, a significant change that would align federal policy more closely with public opinion. President Biden emphasized in a video statement, ""No one should be in jail merely for using or possessing marijuana. Period,"" and expressed his commitment to correcting the wrongs caused by a failed approach to marijuana.Currently, marijuana is classified as a Schedule I drug under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), alongside heroin, ecstasy, and LSD, indicating no accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.The proposal would downgrade it to a Schedule III drug , similar to ketamine and codeine-containing painkillers, which are considered to have a moderate to low likelihood of dependence.The issue of marijuana reclassification is seen as a potential vote-winner for Biden in the upcoming November election, particularly among younger voters. A Pew Research Center survey found that 88 percent of Americans believe marijuana should be legal for medical or recreational use, with only 11 percent opposing legalization entirely. The decision to outlaw cannabis at the federal level in 1937 is criticized for being based largely on racist ideas, as the drug was associated with jazz music, the Black community, and Mexican immigrants, reported AFP.The "" War on Drugs "" in the 1970s also disproportionately affected minorities, particularly Black Americans, who are overrepresented in marijuana-related arrests.The reclassification of marijuana would have significant implications for businesses in the industry, allowing them to access banking services, receive federal funding for medical marijuana research, and engage in interstate commerce. It would also enable companies to deduct their operating expenses from their taxes, which is currently prohibited. The decision has been praised by industry leaders and civil rights organizations, with the NAACP stating, ""Far too many Black Americans have fallen victim to a system designed for their demise.""",Biden administration officially proposed to reclassify marijuana as a less dangerous drug.

The combined value of these properties is around $11 billion.“Dubai Unlocked”, an investigative project by over 70 media outlets around the globe, has revealed ownership of hundreds of properties of prominent global figures, including corrupt politicians,money launderers and drug lords, in Dubai.The data covers records of residential properties from 2020 till 2022.Among an estimated 17,000 Pakistanis listed in the leaksowning 23,000 properties in Dubaiare President Asif Ali Zardari’s three children, two of whom are members of the National Assembly, former PM Nawaz Sharif’s son Hussain Nawaz, home (interior) minister Mohsin Naqvi’s wife, and several national and provincial lawmakers.While Zardari’s elder daughter, Bakhtawar Bhutto-Zardari, is a Dubai resident, his son, Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, and daughter, Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari, were listed as owners of four properties. Through her lawyers, Aseefa said that all assets owned by her in Dubai have been duly declared to the relevant authorities in Pakistan, including the electoral watchdog.The Pakistani list also features the late former military ruler Pervez Musharraf, former PM Shaukat Aziz, ex-army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa’s son, and more than a dozen retired army generals as well as a police chief, an ambassador and a scientist, all of whom owned properties either directly or through their spouses and children.The Altaf Khanani network, which was sanctioned by the US for involvement in money laundering, has also surfaced in the leaks. Moving illicit funds for organised crime groups, including drug cartels and violent terrorist organisations, the network raked in an estimated turnover of between $14 billion and $16 billion annually. Altaf Khanani, the international face of the organisation, was ultimately convicted and spent nearly six years in a US prison; he was blacklisted by the US on money-laundering charges along with his son, Obaid Khanani, and nephew, Hozaifa Khanani. In Dubai, a country where, reportedly, investing in real estate with bags of cash raises few questions, the Khananis are listed owners of a massive real estate portfolio. Obaid himself is linked to around 30 properties, while the family as a whole were listed owners of 85 properties in early 2020, including around a dozen villas.Notably, several Pakistani families involved in politics and business were absent from the data, despite it being well known that they have bases and family residences in Dubai. This underscores that although the data is solid, it is neither a historical record of property ownership nor a comprehensive representation of all properties purchased by Pakistanis in Dubai . Many owners, according to data, still remain undetected, especially those who purchased property via a third party, or lesser-known company.","Among an estimated 17,000 Pakistanis listed in the leaks are President Asif Ali Zardari’s three children, two of whom are members of the National Assembly.

The leak, which has sent shockwaves through Pakistan , involves over 23,000 properties listed as belonging to Pakistani nationals, as detailed in the ""Dubai Unlocked"" investigation conducted by global media outlets.The investigation, conducted by the Centre for Advanced Defence Studies (C4ADS) and shared with global media outlets, sheds light on hundreds of thousands of properties in Dubai, focusing on ownership details.Among the notable Pakistanis listed in the Property Leaks are President Asif Ali Zardari’s children, Hussain Nawaz Sharif , Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi’s wife, Sharjeel Memon, Senator Faisal Vawda, and several lawmakers from Sindh and Balochistan assemblies. The list also includes late Gen Pervez Musharraf , former prime minister Shaukat Aziz, retired generals, a police chief, an ambassador, and a scientist, all of whom have owned properties directly or through their spouses and children.Furthermore, the leaks highlight discrepancies in property declarations, such as Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi’s wife owning a villa in Dubai that was not disclosed in his Senate election nomination papers. The investigation also reveals the involvement of individuals like the Altaf Khanani network, sanctioned for money laundering, and Hamid Mukhtar Shah, a physician involved in criminal activities, as property owners in Dubai.The data reveals properties ranging from studio apartments to lavish six-bedroom villas owned by Pakistan's elite, including political, military, and business figures, across premium locations like Dubai Marina, Emirates Hills, and Palm Jumeirah.The leaked data provides insights into the offshore real estate wealth of Pakistanis, with over 23,000 properties listed as belonging to Pakistani nationals up to the spring of 2022. The data, obtained by C4ADS and shared with media outlets worldwide, does not inherently indicate financial crimes but offers a detailed snapshot of Pakistani investments in Dubai properties during a specific period.The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) of Pakistan views this revelation as a crucial step toward tackling tax evasion .

Despite efforts to regulate and recover undeclared assets, responses from Dubai have been limited, due to lack of geopolitical leverage and political stonewalling.The investigation underscores the challenges faced by Pakistan in bringing undeclared assets into the tax net, with Dubai authorities reluctant to share information on Pakistani citizens owning assets in the emirate.

According to Dawn.com, the leaked data provides a detailed overview of hundreds of thousands of properties in Dubai and information about their ownership or usage, largely from 2020 and 2022.It was obtained by the Centre for Advanced Defence Studies (C4ADS), a non-profit organisation based in Washington, DC, that researches international crime and conflict.The data was then shared with Norwegian financial outlet E24 and the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), which coordinated an investigative project with media outlets from around the world. Titled 'Dubai Unlocked', the collaboration includes 74 partners from 58 countries.The website reported that the details of ""an astounding volume of leaked property data that includes over 17,000 properties listed as belonging to Pakistani nationals up to the spring of 2022"" were known to journalists from scores of media outlets around the world.It stated that while 17,000 Pakistani citizens are listed owners in the 2022 leak, academics using the data and additional sources put the actual number of Pakistani owners of residential property in Dubai at 22,000.They further estimate that the apartments and villas may have been worth more than USD 10 billion at the start of 2022, but with the more than 25 per cent increase in property prices over the last two years, the real worth of Pakistanis' residential properties in Dubai could now be well above USD 12.5 billion.""If we have the data you are talking about, as well as the information on residence status, we will make sure those who are eligible to pay tax in Pakistan on rental income or capital value are doing so,"" Malik Amjed Zubair Tiwana, chairman of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), was quoted as saying by the news portal.""It may be a sensitive matter, and perhaps the law will have to change, but with political will we will go all out against tax evaders.

""We have been trying to get information from the immigration department of Dubai to determine tax status, but it has not materialised.""Ali Rahim, tax lawyer and former Karachi Tax Bar Association president, said that the entire world income of resident Pakistanis is liable to be taxed in Pakistan, but they can get credit against their total tax payment for any taxes paid abroad.Pakistani residents (those in the country for more than 183 days per year) with assets abroad have to value them at the current exchange rate and pay one per cent tax on that if the value of the asset is more than Rs 100 million. This law is being challenged in the high courts and the Supreme Court.Non-resident or overseas Pakistanis are only liable to pay tax on income generated in Pakistan. They are not required to file a wealth statement or declare overseas assets.Dawn also clarified that a mere mention of someone in the data is not evidence in itself of financial crime or tax fraud. Nor does the data contain information such as residence status, sources of income, tax declarations of rental income or capital gains. In fact, several of those approached for comment on their properties said they were declared to the tax authorities.""But it does paint an astonishing picture of contrasts.
