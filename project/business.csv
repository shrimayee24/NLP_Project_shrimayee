NEW DELHI: The govt has blocked 16 Pakistani YouTube channels - including those operated by leading media networks like Geo News, Samaa TV and Dawn News - for ""disseminating provocative and communally sensitive content"" and putting out a misleading narrative against India and its security establishment in the wake of the Pahalgam attack.It also cracked down on two misleading social media posts, including one related to a BBC report referring to terrorists behind the Pahalgam carnage as ""militants"".Sources told TOI that the govt has shot off a letter to BBC against the social media post.

Extreme monsoon may lead to dip in sea fish catch: Study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/extreme-monsoon-may-lead-to-dip-in-sea-fish-catch-study/articleshow/120710761.cms,"Global warming is expected to bring stronger and more unpredictable monsoons to the region. How might these changes affect fish life in the Indian Ocean? A team of researchers tried to answer this question by looking at what happened in the deep past, through evidence left behind in plankton shells dating back 22,000 years on the seabed of the Bay of Bengal. What they found is not reassuring.Monsoon extremes over the past 10-20,000 years led to disruptions in ocean ecosystems and a crash in marine productivity in the Bay of Bengal, showed their study, published in Nature on Monday. Combining these historical patterns with climate projections, researchers found that intense monsoons caused by global warming could result in similar disruptions in marine productivity in the future.""We argue that as the monsoon becomes stronger and more variable, productivity collapses,"" said Kaustubh Thirumalai, the study's lead author and a scientist at the University of Arizona. That's important, he notes, because although the Bay of Bengal covers less than 1% of ocean area, it generates almost 8% of global fishery production. ""The hilsa fishery by itself sustains the protein needs of one of the most densely populated regions in the world,"" he said.For the study, researchers analysed fossilised foraminifera, microscopic single-cell zooplankton that hold a record of environmental conditions in their calcium carbonate shells to reconstruct the history of the Indian summer monsoon. Interestingly, they found that both extremes of rainfall - low and high - led to similar disruptions in ocean ecosystems, suggesting that marine productivity depends on a specific range of environmental conditions.Weak monsoons occurred in a cold phase between 17,500 and 15,000 years ago, while strong monsoons occurred during a period of warming in the early Holocene around 10,000 years ago. Marine productivity declined in both periods.How does monsoon rainfall over land influence ocean processes? One way is through river runoff which brings fresh water from the Ganga and other rivers into the Bay of Bengal. This fresh water forms a layer on the surface of the ocean, preventing the mixing of water. ""If the water doesn't mix, you don't have nutrients replenishing the surface ocean, the sunlit part of the ocean where plankton photosynthesise,"" said Thirumalai. Plankton are the foundation of the ocean's food chain.Warmer oceans - and the Indian Ocean is already warming - can also increase this ""stratification"" of water layers, and prevent the mixing of nutrients-rich waters. ""Climate projections under future boundary conditions show stronger monsoon rainfall, warmer surface waters, and weaker winds - all conditions that echo the past extremes we studied,"" said Tirumalai.The new study is a collaboration between scientists from US, India, and Europe.Another study, from researchers at the Central University of Kerala published last week, came up with similar findings through the analysis of sediments from the Andaman Sea as well as the Bay of Bengal.","Monsoon extremes over the past 10-20,000 years led to disruptions in ocean ecosystems and a crash in marine productivity in the Bay of Bengal.

NEW DELHI Ceasefire along the Line of Control with Pakistan continues to fray, with the exchange of fire between the rival armies for the first time spreading from Kashmir to the Jammu region as well in the aftermath of the Pahalgam massacre .The operational situation, however, has not yet escalated to the deadly artillery duels that were regular before the fresh ""understanding"" reached between the Indian and Pakistani director-generals of military operations in Feb 2021 to maintain peace and tranquility along the 778-km LoC.Defence minister Rajnath Singh met PM Modi Monday morning to discuss the overall situation, as govt contemplates military action in the shape of limited punitive strikes against Pakistan.As the gun duels, with assault rifles and light machine guns continued along the LoC for the fourth consecutive night, Indian Army said that Pakistan Army had initiated ""unprovoked"" small arms fire across LoC at its posts in Kupwara and Poonch districts, among other places.""Firing till now was taking place in Kashmir region like Tutmari Gali, Rampur, Uri, Gurez & Sunderbani sectors. But now, it has taken place in Poonch in Jammu region as well,"" a senior officer said.The Army has recorded at least a dozen ""clear-cut"" ceasefire violations (CFVs) by the Pakistan Army in the last four days, all of which have been responded to ""in double measure"". A CFV is generally said to occur when over 25 rounds of small arms fire are witnessed in one particular place.Any use of heavy-caliber weapons like 155mm artillery guns or 120mm mortars, of course, constitutes a violation. ""There was just one CFV in 2022, zero in 2023 and two in 2024,"" another officer said.Before Feb 2021, India often used targeted artillery and heavy-mortar fire on Pakistan Army posts and bunkers to impose costs for actively aiding and abetting infiltration of terrorists from launch pads into J&K, often by giving ""covering fire"".""The Army has the capability to conduct strikes against terror launch pads, camps and staging areas along the LoC. The military pressure on Pakistan Army can certainly be enhanced with concentrated artillery barrages as well as sniping operations to disrupt their patrols. Then, there are shallow cross-border raids that can be conducted,"" another officer said.","The Indian Army has recorded at least a dozen ""clear-cut"" ceasefire violations (CFVs) by the Pakistan Army in the last four days.

"India to get all 26 Rafale-M jets by 2030 under Rs 63,887 crore deal inked with France",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-to-get-all-26-rafale-m-jets-by-2030-under-rs-63887-crore-deal-inked-with-france/articleshow/120704590.cms,"Rafale-M jet

NEW DELHI: India will get its first Rafale-Marine jet in mid-2028 and all 26 by 2030 under the mega Rs 63,887 crore (almost Euro 7 billion) deal inked with France on Monday for the omni-role fighters that will primarily operate from indigenous aircraft carrier INS Vikrant’s deck.The delivery of nine Rafale-M jets with their decidedly deadly weapons package in 2028, 12 in 2029 and 5 in 2030 will bolster Indian aircraft carrier operations in the Indian Ocean and beyond at a time when China ’s ever-expanding naval forays and hunt for logistical bases in the region have become a clear and present threat, officials told TOI.“The Rafale-M is a carrier-borne combat-ready aircraft with proven operational capabilities. It will be a potent force multiplier, substantially boosting India’s air power at sea,” an official said.These omni-role 4.5-generation maritime strike and reconnaissance jets will add to the 36 Rafales, which are also capable of delivering nuclear weapons, already inducted by the IAF under the Rs 59,000 crore contract inked in Sept 2016. They are deployed at the Ambala and Hasimara airbases to cater for the Pakistan and China fronts.The two major Rafale deals make the French fighter the frontrunner in the long-pending project to manufacture 114 multi-role fighter aircraft (MRFA) with foreign collaboration in India, which was initially estimated to cost Rs 1.25 lakh crore and is now being fast-tracked, as reported by TOI earlier.Apart from the inter-governmental agreement (IGA) on the Rafale-M jets, inked remotely by defence minister Rajnath Singh and his French counterpart Sébastien Lecornu, the aircraft supply protocol with fighter-manufacturer Dassault Aviation and weapons protocol with missile-maker MBDA were also signed here.The exchange of documents took place in the presence of defence secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh, Navy vice chief Vice Admiral Krishna Swaminathan and French ambassador Thierry Mathou, among others.The direct acquisition of 22 single-seater Rafale-M jets and four twin-seater trainers includes training for Indian pilots and technicians, a simulator, associated equipment, weapons and five-year performance-based logistics. It also includes additional equipment for the existing 36 Rafales of the IAF.The Rafale-M jets will be armed with long-range precision strike weapons like the IAF fighters. In addition to the 70-km range Exocet AM39 anti-ship missiles, they will have the over 300-km range `Scalp’ air-to-ground cruise missiles and the top-notch Meteor air-to-air missiles, which have a strike range of 120 to 150-km to take on enemy jets.While there is no overall transfer of technology in the deal, the IGA includes the integration of indigenous weapons like the Astra air-to-air missiles and the naval short and medium-range anti-ship missiles (NASMs) being developed by DRDO with the Rafale-M fighters in the future.It also includes setting up of a production facility for aircraft fuselage as well as MRO (maintenance, repair and overhaul) facilities for engines, sensors and weapons in India. “The Rafale-M’s procurement will substantially enhance joint operational capability, besides optimizing training and logistics for both Navy and IAF,” the official said.The Navy currently has only 40 of the 45 MiG-29K jets, inducted from Russia at a cost of $2 billion from 2009 onwards, to operate from the decks of its two over 40,000-tonne aircraft carriers, the older Russian-origin INS Vikramaditya and the new indigenous INS Vikrant. Moreover, the MiG-29Ks have also been dogged by poor serviceability and other problems over the years.China, incidentally, already has three aircraft carriers, the 60,000-tonne Liaoning, the 66,000-tonne Shandong and the over 80,000-tonne Fujian, and is fast building more such warships with nuclear-propulsion.","India will get its first Rafale-Marine jet in mid-2028 and all 26 by 2030 under the mega Rs 63,887 crore (almost Euro 7 billion) deal inked with France on Monday.

NEW DELHI: Amid growing signs of an imminent retaliation against Pakistan over the Pahalgam terror attack , Prime Minister Narendra Modi urged all govt employees to contribute towards strengthening national security.“It is now your duty to strengthen the nation’s economy; it is your duty to strengthen the country’s internal security; it is your duty to develop modern infrastructure; and it is your duty to bring about fundamental improvements in the lives of workers,” he said on Saturday while distributing employment letters to little over 51,000 new recruits at a virtual event.The exhortation came days after the PM publicly declared his determination to avenge the terror attack by “tracking and pursuing” the perpetrators and the masterminds of the plot until the “end of earth” to hand them a punishment they could not have imagined. It was being seen as an attempt to rally people for any eventuality.The PM said he was confident of the new recruits discharging their responsibilities with utmost devotion.In his address, Modi said govt is taking several steps to create new opportunities for employment and self-employment. He added that it’s time for unprecedented opportunities for youngsters while mentioning that the International Monetary Fund has said India will remain the fastest-growing major economy.The PM said in recent times, the production and exports have achieved new milestones, particularly in the automobile and footwear industries, sectors that provide substantial employment to young people. Highlighting the achievement in transportation of cargo through inland waterways, Modi said goods transport through inland water transport has surged to 145 million tonnes (MTs) from 18 MTs before 2014.On women taking the lead in every field, Modi cited the recent UPSC results where the top two positions were secured by female candidates, and three out of the top five toppers were women. “Women are reaching new heights in fields ranging from bureaucracy to space and science. Our govt is focused on empowering rural women through initiatives like self-help groups, Bima Sakhis, Bank Sakhis, and Krishi Sakhis, which have created new opportunities,” he said.Earlier, personnel minister Jitendra Singh said that nearly 28% of the new recruits (14,796) are women.","PM Narendra Modi urged all govt employees to contribute towards strengthening national security.

"Pahalgam massacre: Pakistani terrorist former para commando, says probe",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pahalgam-massacre-pakistani-terrorist-former-para-commando-says-probe/articleshow/120709449.cms,"NEW DELHI: Hashim Musa , the identified Pakistani terrorist behind the Pahalgam massacre , is a former para commando of Pakistan Army’s Special Forces, investigations into the terror conspiracy have confirmed.Sources told TOI that Musa, now a hardcore terrorist working with the Pakistan-based banned terrorist outfit Lashker e Taiba (LeT), was sent by the LeT masterminds to Kashmir on a specific mission to unleash terror attacks on non-locals as well as security forces. “It is possible that he was loaned by the Pakistan special forces like the Special Service Group ( SSG ), to the LeT,” an officer of the security establishment here said.Para-commandos of SSG are highly-trained in unconventional warfare and specialise in covert operations. The intensive and rigorous training regimen focuses on physical conditioning and mental fitness, besides strategic thinking. SSG commandos are adept at handling sophisticated weapons as well as hand-to-hand combat and have high navigation and survival skills.A senior officer said Musa’s Pakistan Army background — confirmed during the questioning of 15 Kashmir overground workers (OGWs) who have emerged as key suspects in the Pahalgam attack probe for having facilitated the Pakistani assailants by arranging logistics and helping in the reconnaissance — is being seen as evidence of ISI’s role in the Pahalgam terror attack, as also earlier strikes in Kashmir. The latter include the October 2024 terror attacks at Gagangir, Ganderbal, in which 6 non-locals and a doctor were killed, and at Buta Pathri, Baramulla, which had left two Army personnel and two Army porters dead.Musa has emerged as the common perpetrator in all three attacks. Junaid Ahmad Bhat and Arbaaz Mir, two other local terrorists trained in Pakistan, were also involved in the Gagangeer and Buta Pathri attacks but were neutralised in separate encounters with the security forces in November and December 2024. Musa has since been working to carry forward the terror mission to target non-locals in Kashmir, and struck big by killing 26 civilians, including 25 tourists, at Baisaran.The Pahalgam attack investigation has thrown up the involvement of a local network of OGWs and terror facilitators in south Kashmir, who guided the Pahalgam attack team and arranged logistics including shelter and possibly helped in transportation of weapons used in the attack. Detailed reconnaissance of the attack site was carried out with the locals’ involvement, helping in mapping the terrorists’ hiding places before and after the attack.Though the information so far has confirmed the role of two Pakistani terrorists Hashmi Musa and Ali Bhai and as many locals — Adil Thoker and Asif Shaikh — the questioning of OGWs points to the involvement of more Pakistani terrorists.A source said the combing operations in the jungles surrounding Baisaran are at an advanced stage, with the location of the attacks now “reasonably known”. “The search has now been narrowed to a limited area,” an officer told TOI.","Hashim Musa, the identified Pakistani terrorist behind the Pahalgam massacre, is a former para commando of Pakistan Army’s Special Forces, investigations have confirmed.

Taliban Wants To Help India Fight Pakistan? Stunning Move After Islamabad 'Runs To' China | Pahalgam

NEW DELHI: India is the fifth-largest military spender globally, spending almost nine times more than Pakistan. But it also has to contend with China, another nuclear-armed neighbour which spends almost four times more.With the global military expenditure registering the steepest year-on-year increase since the end of the Cold War to reach a record $2,718 billion due to ongoing conflicts and geopolitical turmoil, India is ranked after the US, China, Russia and Germany.The global military expenditure increased by 9.4% in real terms in 2024, with the top five spenders accounting for 60% of the total with a combined spending of $1,635 billion, as per the latest data released by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) on Monday.The report comes at a time when the ceasefire along the Line of Control with Pakistan has frayed after the Pahalgam terror massacre, while China continues with its forward deployment of over 100,000 troops along the Line of Actual Control though disengagement has taken place in eastern Ladakh.""India is probably the only country with two active and long unresolved borders with nuclear-armed neighbours. We must cater for both,"" a senior Indian military officer told TOI.SIPRI said the 10 largest military spenders are US ($997 billion), China ($314 billion), Russia ($149 billion), Germany ($88 billion), India ($86 billion), UK ($82 billion), Saudi Arabia ($80 billion), Ukraine ($65 billion), France ($65 billion) and Japan ($55 billion). Pakistan was placed at the 29th spot with $10bn.India may be a big military spender but somewhat flounders in getting the biggest bang for its buck despite the two-front challenge. Just around 22% of the Rs 6.8 lakh crore ($80 billion) annual defence budget for 2025-26, for instance, is earmarked for capital procurements of new weapon systems and platforms. The rest is gobbled up by salaries and day-to-day operational costs for the 1.4-million-strong armed forces as well as the huge pension bill for over 3.4 million ex-servicemen and defence civilians.India spends just 1.9% of its GDP on defence when at least 2.5% is needed to effectively deal with the collusive threat from China and Pakistan. Apart from the relatively weak defence-industrial base, which makes India the second largest arms importer in the world, another major problem is the relative absence of concrete long-term plans to systematically build military capabilities in tune with the country's geopolitical aspirations.Consequently, the armed forces continue to grapple with major operational shortages on several fronts, ranging from fighters, submarines and helicopters to air defence systems, anti-tank guided missiles and night-fighting capabilities.Also read: 'This time no compromise, Pakistan will be brought to its knees': Union minister Hardeep Singh Puri China is rapidly modernizing its two-million-strong military across the traditional domains of land, air and sea as well as nuclear, space and cyber, recording its 30th consecutive year-on-year hike in its official military budget, which experts say is far less than what it actually spends. Pakistan also is no pushover.""China, the world's second-largest military spender, allocated an estimated $314 billion to its military in 2024, up by 7% from 2023. This was the largest year-on-year percentage increase in China's military spending since 2015,"" SIPRI said.China ""unveiled"" several improved military capabilities in 2024, including new stealth combat aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and uncrewed underwater vehicles. ""China also continued to rapidly expand its nuclear arsenal in 2024 and moved to strengthen certain types of counter-space and cyberwarfare capabilities. It established separate aerospace and cyberspace forces in 2024,"" it added.","India is the fifth-largest military spender globally, spending almost nine times more than Pakistan.

He said the high court can monitor the probe.Justice Nagaprasanna noted that the petitioner has a huge clientele including national security stakeholders like the Indian Army, Air Force, Navy, BEL, HAL, and DRDO, and, that, all its contracts are highly sensitive. The stolen information pertains to a cutting-edge unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).The judge also expressed surprise as to how Prabhat Sharma, former vice-president of NewSpace, who was arrested, was issued a ""notice for appearance"". The judge added that it is only a ""paper arrest.""What should have been custodial interrogation ended up in a mere appearance before the investigating officer, giving rise to doubts of fake investigation, Justice Nagaprasanna observed.""The subject crime has the colour of cyber espionage .

IIT-Delhi tasked with ground survey of waqf properties to plug gaps in data,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/iit-delhi-tasked-with-ground-survey-of-waqf-properties-to-plug-gaps-in-data/articleshow/120708343.cms,"NEW DELHI: With survey data on waqf properties severely lacking despite an ambitious digitisation and geo-tagging plan being in place for several years, govt has tasked IIT-Delhi with carrying out a sample survey of properties registered with state waqf boards and preparing a report on management challenges.“The ground assessment report is expected in the next two months. It will form the basis for recommending to states a template of a survey for creating a robust database of existing registered properties and new ones that will be added in the future,” Union minority affairs secretary Chandra Shekhar Kumar told TOI.There are over 8.72 lakh properties registered as waqf and more than half are in the category of ‘Waqf by User’, as per data shared by states with the minority affairs ministry. Waqf properties are spread over around 39 lakh acres of land across the country, according to the ministry.However, officials said data on the survey of registered properties shared by states on the Waqf Assets Management System of India (WAMSI) portal to authenticate registration details, usage and revenue are severely lacking, resulting in absence of a robust record of onground status of properties. They said it has been noticed that properties being registered by boards were not always being surveyed for verification, resulting in ambiguity and opening up the possibility for disputes.For instance, the portal shows that digitisation data of records is available for just about 3.3 lakh properties. Officials said the problem is that as of now it is not mandatory under law for states to put out information. However, this will change under the Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025, they said, citing provisions in the law that lay down the contours for monitoring and accountability of waqf properties.“The exercise was assigned to IIT-Delhi in Jan. Once it gives its report, it will be studied to provide a base for developing a standardised format for management and survey. It will be shared with state boards to enable them to conduct surveys and step up registration and monitoring of properties already registered,” Kumar said.Even though the Supreme Court is hearing a bunch of petitions challenging the constitutional validity of the amended waqf law, the ministry, given that there is no stay, has started preparations for implementing the Act to streamline the waqf management system.The ministry is planning to set up an internal committee within the next fortnight to draft rules to implement the law, officials said.In keeping with the amendments related to enhancing efficiency of boards, work has started to develop a new website to replace the WAMSI portal. “The new website seeks to weed out problems in the system by bringing in greater transparency and accountability to ensure waqf properties are not only registered on the portal but are actually existing on the ground for the purpose that they were set up for,” Kumar said.",There are over 8.72 lakh properties registered as waqf and more than half are in the category of ‘Waqf by User’ Officials said data on the survey of registered properties shared by states on the Waqf Assets Management System of India (WAMSI) portal are severely lacking.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120708482,imgsize-1267825,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"
Govt eyes battery-swap hubs to ease long journeys for EVs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-eyes-battery-swap-hubs-to-ease-long-journeys-for-evs/articleshow/120708338.cms,"NEW DELHI: Government plans to provide subsidy for setting up battery swapping stations to ensure those undertaking long-distance travel don't have to spend time charging batteries of their electric vehicles , including buses and trucks, and can quickly resume their journey. People can swap batteries - exchanging discharged batteries with charged ones - at these centres by paying an amount.To begin with, the upstream subsidy for battery swapping stations is likely to be provided for setting up facilities for electric buses, trucks, two wheelers and three wheelers, sources said. Swapping of batteries of cars will take time as the standards for this have not been notified yet.The issue of setting up the stations was discussed at length last week by officials from Prime Minister's Office and ministries concerned.The proposal comes at a time when the share of electric vehicles (EVs) in all registered vehicles in 2024-25 increased to 7.3% from barely 0.01% in 2014-15. As per govt data, around 56.8 lakh EVs are registered in the country and the numbers are going to grow considering the govt's big push for green vehicles .The plan also gains significance considering that the govt has identified 61 national highways corridors - totalling 25,639km - for setting up public charging stations at every 100km on both sides for buses and trucks, and at every 20 km on both sides for cars.Officials said battery swapping stations can either be co-located with EV public charging stations or be standalones. ""The details of subsidies that can be provided would be worked out. Setting up battery swapping stations will be a big boost for operating more electric buses and trucks on long routes as these will meet their requirement,"" one of them said.Once the battery swapping protocol for cars is in place, it will revolutionalise EV penetration in the country.Some of the highway stretches put on the priority list for creating battery charging facilities include Delhi-Chandigarh, Delhi-Jaipur, Bangalore-Mumbai, Coimbatore-Bangalore, Goa-Pune, Chennai-Bangalore, Kochi-Kanyakumari, Prayagraj-Patna, Guwahati-Jorhat and Kharagpur-Visakhapatnam.",People can swap batteries - exchanging discharged batteries with charged ones - at these centres by paying an amount.

Pahalgam may spell end of medical tourism from Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pahalgam-may-spell-end-of-medical-tourism-from-pakistan/articleshow/120708328.cms,"(PTI photo)

NEW DELHI: Security tensions and terror attacks on India have been taking a heavy toll on Pakistani patients desperate for advanced treatment across the border with the issuance of visas crashing from over 1,600 in 2016 to barely over 200 in 2024. It could shudder to a halt altogether after the latest terrorist atrocity.A significant disruption came in 2017 with the clash over Indian citizen Kulbhushan Jadhav , whom Pakistan had convicted as an Indian spy, refusing to release him despite a full-blown diplomatic crisis and India urging his release.The medical visas issued to Pakistani nationals in 2016 were 1,678, but the number fell sharply after the Jadhav episode.However, things got complicated further in 2019 as India was rocked by the Pulwama terror attack which brought the two countries to the brink of an armed confrontation. Between 2019 and 2024, data available with TOI shows, only 1,228 medical visas were issued to Pakistani nationals - 554 in 2019, 97 in 2020, 96 in 2021, 145 in 2022, 111 in 2023 and 225 in 2024.In the wake of fresh escalation in the already fraught relationship following the Pahalgam terror attack , healthcare industry experts say the latest tit-for-tat measures between the two countries may sound the death of medical tourism from Pakistan to India, at least in the foreseeable future. Medical visas issued to Pakistani nationals will be valid only till 29 April 2025, the ministry of external affairs announced last Thursday in the wake of the Pahalgam attack.In the aftermath of sentencing of Jadhav in 2017, govt had announced new rules for issuance of medical visas to Pakistani nations which mandated a recommendation letter from adviser to the Prime Minister on Foreign Affairs, to process genuine and urgent cases.""Patients from Pakistan used to visit India mostly for advanced surgeries such as liver transplant and treatment of birth defects that aren't widely available in their country and would cost a lot in other developed nations such as the US or the UK. But in the last six to seven years, the numbers have reduced drastically and now after the Pahalgam incident it is unlikely to go up anytime soon,"" said an official of a medical travel assistance company.""Until 8-9 years ago, many patients from Pakistan came to us for liver transplantation every month. However, their numbers have dwindled over time. We have transplanted just two patients from there in the past year - the last one seven months ago,"" Dr Arvinder Soin, chairman and chief surgeon, Medanta Institute of Liver Transplantation, said.A source at Fortis healthcare also confirmed that Pakistani nationals visiting their hospitals for treatment has reduced significantly over the years. ""We have only had a few Pakistani embassy officials visiting us for routine health issues recently,"" the source said. Indraprastha Apollo Hospital in Delhi said they do not have any Pakistani patient under treatment at the moment.","The medical visas issued to Pakistani nationals in 2016 were 1,678, but the number fell sharply after the Jadhav episode.

VTuber Sinder controversy explained: Allegations and Full Timeline,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/esports/news/vtuber-sinder-controversy-explained-allegations-and-full-timeline/articleshow/120691648.cms,"Image via Sinder

Nanoless accuses Sinder and REDACTED about slandering other creators, exclusivity & blacklisting other creators



“I will start with screenshots showing them speaking ill of other creators & spreading rumors while manipulating me that it’s all in our best interest. In addition to spreading ill rumors they also complain and accuse

Bao

of giving “their” editor too much work, resulting in the editor not having any time for new clients which will be important later on. The screenshots below show them showing their affection & appreciation immediately followed by spreading rumors & lies to make other clients appear problematic to manipulate any future decisions regarding commissions.”

""They mentioned wanting an exclusivity contract, but they didn’t want to pay for exclusivity, but rather when a creator from their blacklist comes asking for a commission, they would guarantee me model work for Sinder only and if anyone asked me for commissions, they’d commission me instead to compensate for not working with other creators. This felt very strange given that one of the accusations they made was overworking their editor yet their “solution” to me working with other creators was for them to essentially overwork me to keep me from working on other projects.""

“The messages below show that their primary concern is that the more non Sinder models I make, the less “valuable” my existing models become. It’s hard to say how much this messed with my mind as an artist that by working with other people I’m somehow making my existing models less special.”

Vampeaches reveals that REDACTED is Sinder’s boyfriend



""I remember playing Phasmophobia with you and hearing RED chat away next to you before you first debuted like 4 years ago. You told me he was your boyfriend. Then before we met for Twitchcon you switched up and said 'just so you know my manager is coming with me on this trip' as if I didn't know who he was. It's even ickier to read this tweet knowing he is your significant other and that you're probably going to try and avoid taking responsibility for hurting people who trusted you as friends by nuking the RED side of this duo.""

Sinder’s official apology



“Redacted has been my co-content creator since I began making content, managing all aspects of what I do, and being a major part of why I’m here. We have also been in a relationship since the start of my endeavors. It’s no secret that many vtubers choose to keep their public and personal lives separate, and I’m no different. As of yesterday he is no longer working with me, and I have not extensively discussed any of this with him. Where our personal situation goes from here will be figured out between us privately. I never intended to mention us publicly, but given that the claims are out there, I want everyone to know I’m taking this seriously. After years of working on everything together, his hyper business oriented outlook warped my view of what it is I should be doing, and what should be important to me as I navigate this career path. I have a terrible work life balance as it is, and being around projects and streams all day every day made me lose sight of the point. It took all of this happening for me to realize this behavior isn’t normal or healthy, and it’s not an outlook I want to have. This doesn’t absolve me of the things I’ve willingly done wrong and went along with, or the way I’ve treated people who were fully undeserving.”

“In regards to Nanoless, for the majority of the time working with her, Red was the one almost solely doing the communication about new plans and negotiations through his private DMs. Nano had a project server we were all a part of where the actual art and models were worked on, but the conversations were focused around the work itself. I was not fully aware of the extent of Red’s manipulation over Nano’s commission decisions, and I should’ve been more diligent in my oversight.”

The popular Twitch VTuber Sinder has come under negative limelight following accusations from the Vtuber artist Nanoless, who issued a Google document about the termination of work. Within the same, Nanoless accused Sinder and her manager REDCATED about “manipulating, using, and dragging them into drama, while sabotaging, slandering & spreading lies about people they thought were the VTuber’s closest friends.The document was posted on Nanoless’ X handle on April 26, 2025, and the controversy has spread like wildfire since then. Here we take a detailed look at all the accusations aimed at VTuber Sinder and REDCATED.Nanoless’ document consists of several allegations, the first one being about Sinder and REDACTED slandering other creators. As part of the same, the VTuber artist shared several Discord screenshots with that of REDACTED. Nanoless claimed that the two spoke ill and spread rumors about other streamers.Nanoless exactly stated:Added to this, Nanoless’ document also mentions about REDACTED speaking ill about Vtubers like Shylily, who is another popular name.Coming to the exclusivity, Sinder and REDACTED essentially wanted to issue an exclusivity contract but didn’t want to pay about the same. Nanoless additionally mentioned that they would compensate for not working with content creators that they had blacklisted. The document mentions:She also added:The screenshots related to the same are on the document itself. You can find the same by heading over to Nanoless’ X account (@Nanoless_)Following the official post by Nanoless, Sinder announced that REDACTED will no longer manager her VTuber activities, and completely cut ties with her manager. Vampeaches responded to this post by revealing that REDACTED is Sinder’s boyfriend. She mentioned the following:Finally, Sinder posted a document titled “My Apology” on April 28, 2025.

Black Hawk pilot Rebecca Lobach didn't listen to her co-pilot before colliding with American Airlines flight,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/black-hawk-pilot-rebecca-lobach-didnt-listen-to-her-co-pilot-before-colliding-with-american-airlines-flight/articleshow/120676717.cms,"Black Hawk pilot Rebecca Lobach took one of the series of missteps that led to the Jan 29 crash in Washington.

Black Hawk pilot failed to heed her co-pilot



Black Hawk probably didn't see the American Airlines flight



Controller could have given a more urgent warning



Radio communications broke down



Controller pulled off a complicated combination



On January 29, the US saw its worst aviation tragedy when a Black Hawk helicopter collided with an American Airlines plane over the Potomac River near Ronald Reagan National Airport, killing everyone on both aircraft. Three months after the tragedy, New York Times investigation has now revealed that there was not one misstep that led to the mishap but a string of complicated failures was behind the fatal crash.The Army crew was conducting the annual evaluation of Captain Rebecca M Lobach to ensure that her helicopter piloting skills were up to par. Her assignment that night was to the conditions of a scenario in which members of Congress or other senior government officials might need to be carried out of the nation’s capital in the event of an attack, the NYT report said.Chief Warrant Officer 2 Andrew Loyd Eaves was her instructor. In the final seconds before impact, Warrant Officer Eaves told Captain Lobach that the air traffic controller wanted her to turn left. But there was no indication that she turned left.The air traffic controller flagged the American Airlines jet, but the Black Hawk crew probably did not detect it or could not pivot to a safer position.The controller alerted the Black Hawk about the American Airlines plane but he did not issue clear, urgent instructions, the investigative report said, citing aviation experts. As the two aircraft moved closer to each other, the controller issued an instruction to the helicopter crew: Pass behind the airplane. He could have told the Black Hawk crew where Flight 5342 was positioned and which way it was bound.Also, the controller did not alert the pilots of American Airlines.The report said some of the controller's instructions got cut out and probably the Black Hawk pilots did not hear what the controller said.The NYT report said the controller was nearing the end of his shift and pulled off a very complicated and risky combination. The route the helicopter was flying and the runway the jet was using to land formed a dangerous combination.The landing of Flight 5342 from Wichita, Kan., was supposed to be a part of that maneuver. In order to pull it off, the controller evidently decided to land that flight not on the commonly used Runway 1, but the little-used Runway 33, which is a narrow vertical space between the landing slope for a jet and the maximum altitude at which helicopters using a certain route, called Route 4, could fly.","Black Hawk pilot Rebecca Lobach took one of the series of missteps that led to the Jan 29 crash in Washington.

The event, held at the Makuhari Messe convention center, showcased new titles like Mario Kart World and Donkey Kong Bonanza, drawing large crowds eager to experience the successor to the original Switch, which has sold over 150 million units since its 2017 debut.""Since Mr. Trump became president tariffs have gone up so I am concerned about a price hike not just for the game console but for accessories too,"" said Hidenori Tanaka, 55, a real estate company employee, who attended the event.Despite the excitement, concerns over potential price hikes due to global trade tariffs have cast a shadow over the launch. Tariffs imposed by the US on trading partners, including China, have raised production costs for electronic devices. While some tariffs have been eased, fears of a renewed trade war persist. Nintendo initially paused pre-orders in the US to assess the impact but later confirmed a price of $449.99 for the console in the region.In Japan, the Switch 2 is priced at 49,980 yen ($350), and demand has been overwhelming, with 2.2 million applications submitted for the lottery to purchase the console.

Read Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan full letter to employees

Team,

Today we reported our Q1 2025 results. It was a step in the right direction as we delivered revenue, gross margin and EPS (earnings per share) above our guidance, driven by Dave and Michelle’s leadership. I want to thank them both, and all of you, for the good execution.

We need to build on this progress — and it won’t be easy. We are navigating an increasingly volatile and uncertain macroeconomic environment, which is reflected in our Q2 outlook. On top of that, there are many areas where we must improve. We need to confront our challenges head-on and take swift actions to get back on track.

As I have said, this starts by revamping our culture. The feedback I have received from our customers and many of you has been consistent. We are seen as too slow, too complex and too set in our ways — and we need to change.

Our flatter Executive Team (ET) structure that I shared last week was a first step. The next step is to drive greater simplicity, speed and collaboration across the entire company. To achieve these objectives, today I am announcing some important changes.

Becoming an Engineering-Focused Company

We need to get back to our roots and empower our engineers. That’s why I elevated our core engineering functions to the ET. And many of the changes we will be driving are designed to make engineers more productive by removing burdensome workflows and processes that slow down the pace of innovation.

To make necessary investments in our engineering talent and technology roadmaps, we need to find new ways to reduce our costs. While we have taken significant actions in the last year, our current cost structure is still well above competitive benchmarks. With that in mind, we have reduced our operating expense and capital spending targets going forward, which I will discuss during our investor call this afternoon.

Flattening the Organization

As we refocus on engineering, we will also remove organizational complexity. Many teams are eight or more layers deep, which creates unnecessary bureaucracy that slows us down. I have asked the ET to take a fresh look at their respective orgs, with a focus on removing layers, increasing spans of control and empowering top performers. Our competitors are lean, fast and agile — and that’s what we must become to improve our execution.

I’ve been surprised to learn that, in recent years, the most important KPI for many managers at Intel has been the size of their teams. Going forward, this will not be the case. I’m a big believer in the philosophy that the best leaders get the most done with the fewest people. We will embrace this mindset across the company, which will include empowering our top talent to make decisions and take greater ownership of key priorities.

There is no way around the fact that these critical changes will reduce the size of our workforce. As I said when I joined, we need to make some very hard decisions to put our company on a solid footing for the future. This will begin in Q2 and we will move as quickly as possible over the next several months.

We are going to be very intentional about where we focus these efforts and how we stack up against the best in the industry. We have learned some valuable lessons from past actions. We must balance our reductions with the need to retain and recruit key talent. I will empower each of my leaders to make the best possible decisions aligned with our top priorities. These decisions will not be made lightly, and we will keep you regularly informed.

Streamlining Our Processes

It has been eye-opening for me to see how much time and energy is spent on internal administrative work that does not move our business forward. We need to radically simplify this to maximize the time spent focusing on our customers.

I am instructing our leaders to eliminate unnecessary meetings and significantly reduce the number of meeting attendees. Too much valuable time is being wasted. We will also modernize processes with a focus on live dashboards and better data to ensure we have the real-time insights we need to make better and faster decisions.

In addition, I have decided to make our formal Insights and OKR requirements optional. While it’s crucial for us to stay accountable for our results and receive feedback on our performance, I believe we can achieve this in a simpler and more flexible way. Along the same lines, we will cut back on time-consuming corporate administrative tasks such as non-essential training and documentation.

Returning to the Office

Our existing policy is that our hybrid employees should spend approximately three days per week on site. Adherence to this policy has been uneven at best. I strongly believe that our sites need to be vibrant hubs of collaboration that reflect our culture in action.

When we spend time together in person, it fosters more engaging and productive discussion and debate. It drives better and faster decision-making. And it strengthens our connection with colleagues.

With that in mind, we will be updating our policy to require four days per week on site by Sept. 1. I wanted to tell you well in advance so that you have time to make any adjustments to your daily routines. We are going to work hard in the meantime to ensure sites are ready to operate at full capacity. Your local leadership will share site-specific details and seek your input on how to create the best possible on-site experience.

Building a New Intel

I realize this is a lot to take in, but we are playing from behind and we need to rally as a team to put ourselves in the best possible position to win.

This requires us to be laser-focused on developing the best products. We need to delight our customers and earn their trust by delivering the performance, quality and reliability they need to succeed. We must demonstrate predictable execution and ensure on-time delivery. And we need to deliver consistent returns for our shareholders.

There are two ways teams can respond at make-or-break moments like this: They can look at the gap they need to close and give up — or they can look inside themselves and fight like never before.

I made my choice last month when I decided to join you all, and there is no place I would rather be right now. I came on board knowing full well this would be the most challenging job of my career, but also the most motivating and fulfilling — because we have opportunities ahead that most people don’t get in their careers.

I’m talking about the opportunity to fundamentally reinvent an industry icon. To pull off a comeback that will be studied in business schools for generations to come. To create new technologies and deploy them at scale to change the world for the better.

Intel was once widely seen as the world’s most innovative company. There’s no reason we can’t get back there, so long as we drive the changes needed to improve.

It’s going to be hard. It will require painful decisions. But we will make them knowing it’s what we must do to serve our customers better as we build a new Intel for the future – and I have great confidence in the power of our team and our people to make it happen.

Thank you for everything you did in Q1. I look forward to talking more tomorrow during our All Company Meeting.

Lip-Bu Tan

Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan has announced sweeping restructuring measures including layoffs, management cuts, and an expanded return-to-office mandate as the struggling chipmaker attempts to regain its competitive edge. The changes aim to eliminate ""unnecessary bureaucracy"" and streamline operations to foster innovation, and Tan notes that “this starts by revamping our [company’s] culture.""""I've been surprised to learn that, in recent years, the most important KPI for many managers at Intel has been the size of their teams. Going forward, this will not be the case. I'm a big believer in the philosophy that the best leaders get the most done with the fewest people,"" Tan wrote in a company memo. The company didn’t specify the exact number of job cuts, but with around 108,900 employees at the end of last year, reports suggest up to 20% of the workforce could be impacted.""Many teams are eight or more layers deep, which creates unnecessary bureaucracy that slows us down,"" Tan wrote in a company memo. The new CEO, who has been at the helm for only five weeks, is targeting $1.5 billion in operating expense reductions over the next two years.The flattening will begin in Q2, and Tan says will be continuing into the next few months.These cuts follow a previous round of layoffs just eight months ago when Intel eliminated 15,000 positions.The restructuring prioritizes engineering talent and aims to make engineers ""more productive by removing burdensome workflows and processes that slow down the pace of innovation."" Tan is shifting focus away from measuring management success by team size toward a leaner structure emphasizing execution.The announcement came as Intel released disappointing first-quarter earnings, and the company has struggled to keep pace with industry shifts toward artificial intelligence, which Tan identified as a key focus moving forward.Intel also recently announced that starting September 1, it will require four in-office days weekly from its employees. This change replaced the company's two-day remote policy to boost collaboration. Tan made this announcement as a part of a strategic roadmap during the company’s Q1 2025 earnings call.","CEO Lip-Bu Tan: ""We are seen as too slow, too complex and too set in our ways"" ""We need to get back to our roots and empower our engineers,"" Tan says.

Ramalinga Reddy: Karnataka Transport Minister Orders Shutdown of Bike-Taxi Operations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/karnataka-transport-minister-directs-officials-to-halt-bike-taxi-operations/articleshow/120649642.cms,"File photo used for representational purpose.

BENGALURU: In a move that could reshape daily commute, transport minister Ramalinga Reddy has ordered the shutdown of bike taxi operations across the state, following a high court directive .In a letter to the transport department secretary and the transport and road safety commissioner Friday, Reddy instructed the officials to act swiftly on the court's recent ruling. The court order, dated April 2, directed the aggregators of bike taxis to cease all operations within six weeks. It also directed the state govt to ensure compliance. ""The Karnataka high court has given its order to cease operations. I have instructed the officials to comply with the same,"" Reddy said.With this, the chances of the govt coming up with new rules for bike taxis are remote and major aggregators like Uber, Rapido, and Ola will have time until mid-May to pull their bike taxis off the roads. When asked about the future of bike taxis, the minister pointed to the court order and chose not to comment further.The ban on bike taxis is likely to benefit autorickshaw and taxi drivers in the city. In the past, they protested against bike taxi operations, calling them illegal, unsafe, and a threat to their revenues.On the other hand, regular users of bike taxis feel that Bengaluru should have multiple options for commuters. They say banning bike taxis is nothing but denying a convenient and affordable travel option for the general public. Instead, the govt should regulate them, they said.In 2021, the govt brought out an e-bike taxi scheme with several regulations, but last year, it was withdrawn, citing misuse, safety concerns, and other issues. Stiff opposition from autorickshaw and taxi drivers also played a role in the withdrawal of the notification. It is said the city has 70,000 to 1 lakh bike taxis attached to major aggregators, with a majority of the gig workers being youngsters.Students who have been relying on bike taxi services in the city fear that banning the travel alternative would go against their interests.""The bike taxi ban will increase travel costs, disrupt daily commutes, and add financial stress,"" said Poojita Katari, a student at Christ University.Mehul Datta, a student of Ramaiah University, highlighted that transport alternatives such as BMTC buses, while cheaper, are not always viable for his commute due to long wait times and overcrowding during peak hours. ""I'll be inconvenienced by the sudden lack of affordable transport,"" he added.Many students believe that bike taxis help them reach college on time more reliably than other modes of transport. ""Public transport won't get me to my first class on time due to traffic and limited availability,"" said Yuktha S, a daily commuter between Chikkalsandra and Koramangala.""The main problem is that public transport in Bengaluru is not efficient. The nearest bus stop is quite far, and there's no bus stop near my office. So, I end up walking a lot. Booking a bike taxi is much more convenient than relying on city buses,"" said Mark Jordan, a student currently interning at a company.Others also feel that, considering the city's traffic density, bike taxis offer a convenient travel option. ""Without this convenient option, the long wait for public transport and traffic delays would make commuting much harder,"" said Kritika Chettri, a student.","Transport minister Ramalinga Reddy has ordered the shutdown of bike taxi operations across the state.

Who is Mark Carney?

Born in Fort Smith, Northwest Territories, and raised in Edmonton, Alberta.

Studied economics at Harvard University and completed a doctorate at Oxford.

Made his early fortune at Goldman Sachs, working in New York, Tokyo, London, and Toronto.

Appointed Governor of the Bank of Canada in 2008, steering the economy through the global financial crisis.

Became the first non-Briton to lead the Bank of England in 2013, helping stabilise markets after the Brexit vote.

Served as a United Nations special envoy on climate action and finance after leaving the Bank of England.

Chaired Brookfield Asset Management, one of Canada's largest investment firms, before entering politics.

Campaigned heavily against Donald Trump’s annexation rhetoric, promising to defend Canadian sovereignty.

Known for his technocratic style and crisis leadership, but won over voters by embracing a more combative, nationalistic tone during the election.

Mark Carney ’s journey from governor of the Bank of England to becoming Canada’s full-term Prime Minister has been nothing short of extraordinary. Once known as the calm technocrat brought in to steady financial markets during crises, Carney is now heading towards securing a full mandate to lead his home country. As per the latest results, Liberals are ahead in 158 ridings, while the Conservatives lead in 147.Carney, who only took over as Liberal leader following Justin Trudeau’s resignation, managed to transform what once looked like a certain Conservative landslide into a fourth consecutive term for his party. Although it remains unclear whether the Liberals have secured an outright parliamentary majority, their performance marks a stunning political turnaround in just a few short months.The campaign had seemed destined to be a referendum on Trudeau’s decade in power, marred by rising living costs and public fatigue. However, Trump’s repeated attacks on Canada’s sovereignty, calls for it to become America’s ""51st state,"" and new sweeping tariffs energised Canadian voters. Carney’s financial expertise and steady hand proved appealing to a country worried about economic fallout and national pride.Despite having never served in Parliament before, Carney persuaded voters that his background as a crisis manager made him the best candidate to confront Trump’s threats. His promise to protect Canadian workers, cut middle-class taxes, maintain dental care, and return immigration to sustainable levels clearly resonated at the ballot box.","Carney won over voters by embracing a more combative, nationalistic tone.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%.

Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","As job cuts continue to rise in various industries, some employees are going for 'career cushioning' Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. A greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/exemptions is the need of the hour.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
Delhi Results 2025: 'LinkedIn Lessons' from Brand BJP's win and Brand AAP's loss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-results-2025-linkedin-lessons-from-brand-bjps-win-and-brand-aaps-loss/articleshow/118066797.cms,"AAP: From Disruptor to Establishment to Decline



AAP was the ultimate political startup—the kind that raises Series A, B, and C funding at record speed, becomes a unicorn, and then implodes under its own weight. It was supposed to be the alternative to traditional politics, the fresh face in a crowded market, a party that rejected caste, religion, and dynasty-driven politics.

But somewhere along the way, it stopped being a startup and started behaving like an old-school corporate giant—bloated, bureaucratic, and overconfident.

1) From Lean & Agile to Bureaucratic & Slow

AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach—the political equivalent of a D2C brand shaking up a legacy market.

Over time, it became centralized and top-heavy, with decision-making confined to a handful of leaders. MLAs became inaccessible, the leadership became distant, and ground-level mobilization weakened. No succession planning. Kejriwal remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force.

remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force. The result? Voters saw it as just another party, not the disruptor it once was.

2) A Reputation Built on Ethics, Lost to Scandals

AAP built its brand on fighting corruption—but its own leadership got embroiled in one of the biggest scandals of its time, the liquor policy scam.

Manish Sisodia, Sanjay Singh, and even Kejriwal himself faced corruption allegations, undoing years of anti-corruption positioning.

The Sheesh Mahal controversy—where Kejriwal’s residence was allegedly renovated with ₹45 crore of taxpayer money—completely shattered the “humble leader” narrative.

AAP’s response? Defensive, aggressive, and dismissive. Instead of damage control, it doubled down on denial—a classic PR blunder.

The perception shift was swift and brutal—from “anti-corruption warriors” to just another power-hungry political entity.

3) Ignoring the Middle-Class Voter That Built Its Base

AAP was originally the party of the middle class—frustrated taxpayers who wanted clean governance and economic relief.

Over time, its focus shifted to freebies and populist policies, leaving the middle class feeling ignored.

BJP stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters.

stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters. Kejriwal’s pre-election outreach to the middle class felt forced and last-minute—while BJP had already solidified its positioning.

Takeaway ? A business (or party) that forgets its core customer will eventually lose them.

4) Blaming External Factors Instead of Owning Failures

For 10 years, AAP blamed the Centre, the LG, and opposition parties for everything.

The “victim card” was effective in the early years but wore thin by 2025—voters expected governance, not excuses.

BJP flipped this weakness into an advantage, promising that with a BJP-led government, there would be no Centre-state conflicts, leading to “seamless governance.”

The narrative changed from “AAP vs. BJP” to “AAP vs. Results.” Lesson? Leaders who constantly shift blame instead of delivering solutions lose credibility.

5) Strategic Missteps and Lack of Political Alliances

AAP contested separately from Congress, which led to a split in the anti-BJP vote.

Rahul Gandhi’s direct attacks on Kejriwal made matters worse—AAP was getting hit from both sides.

Internal conflicts weakened the party further. Atishi and Saurabh Bharadwaj were seen as Kejriwal’s successors, but there was no clear transition strategy.

BJP: A Masterclass in Strategic Adaptation

BJP’s 2025 win in Delhi was not a Modi-centric sweep but a well-calibrated organizational comeback. After a lackluster 2024 Lok Sabha performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader.

performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader. Unlike AAP, BJP adapted, restructured, and executed flawlessly.

1) Moving Beyond Modi Dependency

BJP understood that Delhi’s electorate needed a more localized approach.

Instead of making the election about Modi, it focused on governance, urban issues, and direct voter engagement.

No CM face? It didn’t matter. The party projected collective leadership instead of relying on one individual.

By decentralizing its campaign, BJP looked more stable and future-ready.

2) Adopting AAP’s Own Strategies Against It

BJP neutralized AAP’s welfare advantage—promising free electricity, continued subsidies, and additional financial support for women.

Middle-class tax reliefs were announced just before the elections, ensuring they won over voters that AAP had neglected.

The manifesto focused on real urban issues—pollution control, traffic congestion, and infrastructure—exactly what AAP had failed to address convincingly.

Lesson? The best way to beat a competitor is to adopt their strengths while exposing their weaknesses.

3) Letting Congress Do The Attacking



BJP didn’t need to attack AAP aggressively—Rahul Gandhi and Congress did that for them.

By letting AAP and Congress fight it out, BJP consolidated its voter base while the opposition split.

AAP’s credibility suffered more because the attacks came from within the anti-BJP camp.

A strategic win, without unnecessary effort.

4) A Disciplined, Focused, and Well-Executed Campaign

BJP stayed on message, focusing on corruption, governance, and economic stability.

The campaign was structured and well-planned, unlike AAP’s which seemed reactive and disorganized.

The promise to investigate AAP’s corruption cases resonated with voters, reinforcing BJP’s stance on accountability.

In business terms? BJP had a clear marketing strategy, strong brand positioning, and flawless execution.

5) Final Takeaways

Adaptability is key. BJP recalibrated after its 2024 Lok Sabha setbacks, while AAP remained stagnant.

Brand trust is fragile. AAP built its image on honesty but lost credibility due to scandals and mismanagement.

Execution matters more than rhetoric. BJP delivered a disciplined, well-structured campaign.

Leadership succession planning is critical. AAP failed to build second-line leadership, while BJP showcased organizational depth.

Voters reward governance, not excuses. After a decade in power, AAP’s blame game no longer worked.

Politics, like business, rewards those who adapt, execute, and deliver.

Ah, another election, another flood of LinkedIn wisdom posts—where every poll result is a ""case study,"" every political leader is a ""CEO,"" and every campaign is an ""MBA-level lesson in leadership."" Some call it democracy, but on LinkedIn, it’s all about business jargon and corporate analogies.So, let’s break this down the LinkedIn way.BJP, on the other hand, had a structured, disciplined campaign with clear messaging and no internal rifts. In politics and business, a divided team rarely wins.","AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach.

Ten years of incumbency

Liquor scam, Sheesh Mahal dent Kejriwal's 'imandaar' image

No tie-up, Congress did strategic campaigning

Flood of freebies but no next-level of development

BJP focuses on Kejriwal, Hindutva takes back seat

BJP's latent vote

Rahul roasted Kejriwal as payback for Haryana

MCD with AAP: No excuses

Steady exodus of AAP leaders

AAP goes negative

The BJP on Saturday pulled off a major political upset by unseating the Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ) from Delhi after over 10 years. As per the latest Election Commission data, the BJP may win around 48 seats and the Kejriwal-led party may secure around 22 seats in the 70-seat Assembly.BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in a fierce contest from the New Delhi seat by a margin of 4,089 votes. Verma, 47, bagged 30,088 votes, while Kejriwal and Congress' Sandeep Dikshit got 25,999 votes and 4,568 votes.Kejriwal conceded his defeat and hoped that the BJP will fulfill all its promises.""We accept the mandate of the people with great humility. I congratulate the BJP for this victory and I hope they will fulfil all the promises for which people have voted for them,"" Kejriwal said in a video address posted on X.In the evening as the results were decalred, PM Modi kicked off his victory speech with a powerful chant of ""Yamuna Maiya ki Jai"". PM Modi declared that the people of Delhi were experiencing both relief and joy -- relief from the ""disaster"" (AAP-da governance) and joy in embracing a new era under BJP rule. ""I had written a letter to every Delhi resident, urging them to give the BJP a chance to serve in the 21st century...Today, I bow my head in gratitude to every family in Delhi for trusting us. You have given us love with an open heart, and I assure you that we will return it manifold through rapid development,"" PM Modi said.The Prime Minister also attacked the AAP over allegations of corruption against its leaders, saying that all links of such charges will be probed and those who ""looted"" money will have to return it.With the BJP set to regain control of Delhi after 27 years, what went wrong for the Aam Aadmi Party?After governing Delhi for a decade, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) faced significant anti-incumbency.While AAP achieved impressive results in health and education during its first two terms, and kept voters happy with power and water subsidies, unfulfilled promises, such as improved air quality, became major poll issues.The AAP's assertion that the BJP government at the Centre was creating roadblocks in its functioning began to be increasingly seen by voters as excuses, especially after ten years in power.The BJP's ""double engine"" promise, suggesting seamless governance between the central and state levels, appealed to voters against the backdrop of AAP's constant conflicts with the Centre. Furthermore, internal disarray within the AAP, with senior leaders facing jail time, added to the challenges of incumbency .The image of Arvind Kejriwal as an anti-corruption crusader suffered a setback due to several factors, most notably the controversy surrounding the now-scrapped liquor policy.The BJP accused the AAP government of turning Delhi into a ""city of drunkards"" with the new policy, and receiving crores in kickbacks from those who opened the vends.Probes by central agencies led to the arrest of top AAP leaders, including Arvind Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia, and Sanjay Singh. These arrests forced Sisodia to step down as deputy chief minister and kept the AAP in ""firefighting mode"", distracting from fulfilling its 2020 poll promises.Additionally, the ""Sheesh Mahal"" controversy, referring to the renovated residence of the chief minister, further dented Kejriwal's image. The BJP further highlighted a Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) report that indicated the renovation cost had increased from an initial estimate of Rs 7.91 crore to Rs 33.66 crore by completion.AAP has been synonymous with Arvind Kejriwal since its inception. Kejriwal, initially seen as an agent of change with his untucked shirt and no-nonsense demeanor, resonated with the common person.However, the anti-corruption image of Kejriwal and his party suffered irreparable damage, specially after the AAP leader's arrest in March 2024 on corruption allegations and his subsequent resignation as CM.While he was later granted bail, the leadership transition to Atishi and the circumstances surrounding Kejriwal's arrest damaged the party's image and cohesion.The absence of an alliance with the Congress party and the Congress's strategic campaigning likely contributed to the AAP's loss.In previous elections, the AAP had significantly reduced the Congress's presence in the Delhi assembly.Attempts to convince Congress workers to collaborate with AAP volunteers reportedly led to an ""existential crisis"" among them.The Congress decided to campaign aggressively against the AAP, sensing ""anger building up against the AAP"". Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra attacked the AAP in the final days of the Delhi campaign.The Congress further claimed the AAP did not want an alliance, with Kejriwal announcing all 70 candidates early on.The rise of AAP in Delhi has been congruous with the decline of the Congress. In 2013, AAP won 28 seats with a 29.49% vote share, while the Congress tally decreased to 8 seats from 43 in 2008. In 2015, Congress suffered a 15% decline in its vote share, while the AAP saw its support base rise by around 15%.While AAP's welfare schemes, such as free electricity and bus travel for women, initially garnered support, a lack of focus on infrastructure development and maintenance became a significant issue.The poor condition of roads and sewers across Delhi angered voters.Overflowing drains, potholed roads, and irregular garbage collection contributed to the party's unpopularity.The AAP's control over the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) meant it could not deflect blame for these issues onto the BJP. Voters in middle- and upper-middle-class areas were particularly affected by the deteriorating infrastructure.AAP's origins trace back to Anna Hazare’s anti-corruption movement, positioning the party as an alternative to the Congress in 2013.While AAP secured mandates in 2015 and 2020, their repeated promises and ""freebies"" seem to have lost their appeal.The promise of piped water connections for all in 2015 remains unfulfilled, as does the promise of full statehood for Delhi and the ""Rozgar Budget"" aimed at creating 20 lakh jobs.Kejriwal himself admitted that he had failed to fulfill three promises: cleaning the Yamuna, providing clean drinking water, and upgrading Delhi's roads. This acknowledgment gave the BJP an opportunity to attack the AAP, with Amit Shah mocking Kejriwal's promise to purify the Yamuna.The BJP's campaign strategy focused primarily on targeting Arvind Kejriwal and his government, rather than emphasising Hindutva, as it has often done during campainging in other state elections as well as previous Delhi polls.This approach likely resonated with a broader segment of the population, including those who may not have been inclined to support a religiously charged campaign. By focusing on issues such as corruption and governance, the BJP effectively undermined AAP's credibility and appealed to a wider range of voters.The BJP also focused on hyper-local issues such as air pollution, traffic, and public safety, and engaged with local Resident Welfare Associations. They also promoted central government schemes.The BJP also targeted specific demographics, including Purvanchalis and slum dwellers, and utilised an aggressive digital campaign with AI-enhanced content and memes targeting AAP.The BJP's consistent performance in the Lok Sabha polls in Delhi indicated a latent voter base that the party successfully mobilised this time around for the assembly elections.Despite AAP's strong performance in the assembly elections, the BJP had consistently swept Lok Sabha elections in the national capital, winning all seven seats.This pre-existing support base provided a foundation for the BJP's campaign and likely contributed to their victory.The BJP also strategically fielded Parvesh Verma, a strong Jat leader, in the New Delhi constituency, signaling their intention to win back the confidence of the Jat community, which had previously favoured AAP in Delhi elections.During the Delhi Assembly elections, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi launched strong criticisms against Arvind Kejriwal, which may have been payback for events in Haryana. Gandhi's attacks covered a range of issues, including alleged corruption, unfulfilled promises, and inaction on key issues.Like the BJP, Gandhi attacked Kejriwal over the alleged liquor scam and accused him of living in a ""Sheesh Mahal"" while engaging in corrupt practices.Gandhi said that Kejriwal made false promises, ""similar to Prime Minister Narendra Modi"", particularly regarding cleaning the Yamuna River. He also challenged Kejriwal to drink Delhi's tap water, implying it was still polluted despite promises to clean it.The Aam Aadmi Party's (AAP) win in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) in 2022 proved to be a double-edged sword, ultimately hurting the party instead of helping it. AAP had promised a cleaner city with world-class roads, but it fell short on both accounts. The MCD House was in limbo, and the Standing Committee, which controls all financial powers, was never formed. The AAP repeatedly accused the Centre of creating hurdles through the Lieutenant Governor and stalling projects.This time around, voters held the AAP accountable for the deteriorating civic infrastructure across Delhi.AAP's performance in the MCD was a letdown for the people of Delhi. The party failed to address critical issues such as clearing garbage, repairing roads, and cleaning clogged sewers. Erratic water supply and overflowing sewers that were never repaired because Rs 4,000 crore for the Delhi Jal Board was not released further hurt the party.Senior party leaders stated that the MCD functioning had collapsed under the AAP, and no work was being done, leading to frustration among councillors.The steady departure of senior leaders from AAP over time might have also weakened the party's organisational structure and public image.The exit of prominent figures like Prashant Bhushan, Yogendra Yadav, Mayank Gandhi, and Kumar Vishwas, who had dared to disagree with Arvind Kejriwal, and repeatedly accused Kejriwal of having an ""autocratic"" style of leadership.Resignation of senior leaders like Kailash Gahlot, who cited the party's focus on political agenda over fulfilling promises, along with internal challenges, signalled internal discord.The BJP had termed Gahlot's resignation a ""courageous move"".Negative campaigning by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) centered on issues like Yamuna River pollution, the Delhi Police, and the Election Commission (EC) may have affected public perception of the AAP government.In the lead up to the polls, Kejriwal accused the BJP-led Haryana government of poisoning the Yamuna River, which supplies drinking water to Delhi. He claimed that the Haryana government deliberately sent polluted waters to Delhi to create an artificial water scarcity and blame the AAP.The AAP also repeatedly levelled accusations of voter fraud and irregularities against the BJP as well as the EC.AAP alleged that the Election Commission and Delhi Police were shielding BJP workers and accused them of ""hooliganism"". Kejriwal wrote to the Chief Election Commissioner, expressing concern over the intimidation and harassment of AAP volunteers by BJP workers. The EC responded that no written complaints could be traced in most cases but assured that all registered complaints are investigated.Kejriwal further criticised the Election Commission for allegedly refusing to make Form 17C public, a document detailing the number of votes polled at each booth. AAP then launched a website, transparentelections.in, claiming to upload Form 17C data for all constituencies to present the data in an accessible format.The EC dismissed Kejriwal's claims regarding Form 17C, stating that copies had already been provided to polling agents at each booth after voting, as per Rule 49S of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961.","BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal.

Bangladesh Currency Crisis: Bangladesh faces currency crisis as central bank halts issuing notes featuring Mujibur Rahman,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladesh-faces-currency-crisis-as-central-bank-halts-issuing-notes-featuring-mujibur-rahman/articleshow/120714882.cms,"Approximately Taka 15,000 crore worth of notes remain unused

DHAKA: The central bank of Bangladesh has apparently incurred a huge financial loss due to the interim govt’s decision not to issue previously printed notes, with approximately Taka 15,000 crore worth of paper notes featuring the image of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman remaining unused. The decision aligns with govt’s efforts to diminish Bangabandhu’s presence in public memory.Although bank officials are unwilling to discuss the matter publicly, many, on conditions of anonymity, said the longstanding tradition of obtaining new notes from Bangladesh Bank has been abruptly halted, creating a crisis in the market. On the one hand, the printed money is being wasted without use; on the other hand, customers are suffering as a result, they added.“Notes of various denominations are printed using paper and ink purchased with people’s taxes. Millions of notes with Bangabandhu’s picture are still lying in the vaults of various banks. The Security Printing Corporation does not have the capacity to cancel all the notes at once and print new ones. Therefore, notes with Bangabandhu’s picture cann’t be suddenly cancelled,” Ziauddin Ahmed, former executive director of Bangladesh Bank and former managing director of Security Printing Corporation, told reporters.In this situation, he suggested the printed notes be circulated in the market to alleviate public suffering. “When new design notes come into the market, the old ones should be gradually withdrawn. Generally, notes printed once can be used for a maximum of four to five years,” Ahmed said.According to media reports, Bangladesh Bank is unable to issue new notes to banks in line with demand. The crisis became evident following the country’s political upheaval in Aug last year.Since all forms of currency, including metal coins, feature Mujibur’s image, Bangladesh Bank abruptly stopped issuing new notes early April. As a result, the notes featuring Bangabandhu’s image are not reaching the market. Shops, banks, and citizens are now left with torn and old, dirty notes.According to sources at Bangladesh Bank, the Security Printing Corporation is set to begin printing new design notes next month. In the first phase, new design notes of 20, 50, and 1,000 taka will be printed and subsequently released in the market through banks.","Taka 15,000 crore worth of paper notes featuring the image of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman remain unused.

How the elections work and when to expect results

Canadians head to the polls today in a crucial federal election after a dramatic few months shaped by political changes at home and tensions with the United States. Prime Minister Mark Carney , who took office in March following Justin Trudeau’s resignation, called the snap election in response to growing political pressure and a worsening trade dispute with US President Donald Trump.Initially seen as vulnerable, the Liberal Party's prospects have improved as Carney presented himself as a steady leader against external economic threats. Canadians will now decide who will govern as they elect representatives to the House of Commons across 343 constituencies, where the majority is 172 seats.Prime Minister Mark Carney, 60, leads the Liberal Party into his first general election. Carney, a former head of the Bank of Canada and Bank of England, was chosen as Liberal leader with overwhelming support earlier this year. Despite his financial expertise and international reputation, this marks his first attempt at winning public office in Canada.The other main contender is Pierre Poilievre , 45, the leader of the Conservative Party. A long-time Member of Parliament from Calgary, Poilievre has built his campaign around promises of smaller government and lower taxes, criticising the Liberals for what he called ""woke"" policies and economic mismanagement. Once leading the polls comfortably, Poilievre has found the race tightening in recent weeks.Jagmeet Singh leads the New Democratic Party ( NDP ), a progressive force that currently holds 24 seats. Meanwhile, Yves-François Blanchet heads the Bloc Québécois, a Quebec nationalist party with strong regional support.At the time Parliament was dissolved, the Liberals held 152 seats, the Conservatives 120, the Bloc 33, and the NDP 24, with the remainder scattered among independents and smaller parties.The Liberal Party, currently in power, is now led by Mark Carney, a former Bank of Canada and Bank of England governor. Carney took over from Justin Trudeau and positions the Liberals as centrist, focusing on affordability, climate action, and social supports.The Conservative Party, Canada’s main opposition, is led by Pierre Poilievre. He champions lower taxes, cutting red tape, and a tougher stance on crime and immigration, appealing to fiscally conservative voters.The New Democratic Party (NDP), led by Jagmeet Singh, advocates for social justice, wealth redistribution, and expanded public services like dental care and affordable housing.The Bloc Québécois, under Yves-François Blanchet, focuses solely on Quebec’s interests, promoting its autonomy within Canada.The Green Party, co-led by Elizabeth May, which pushes for environmental sustainability and climate-focused economic reforms.The shadow of US President Donald Trump looms large over today's election. Trump's imposition of tariffs on Canadian goods and his provocative suggestion that Canada should become the ""51st state"" have stirred nationalist sentiment among Canadian voters.Affordability issues are shaping the concerns of younger Canadians in this election. Among voters aged 18 to 44, 43% cited housing as the most pressing issue facing the country, underlining the impact of soaring home prices and rental costs. US-Canada relations ranked second for this group, named by 39%, followed closely by inflation at 38%.In contrast, older Canadians aged 45 and above are more concerned with traditional pillars of security. They are significantly more likely to cite healthcare, the Canada Pension Plan (CPP), and Old Age Security (OAS) as top priorities. These concerns reflect growing unease over an ageing population and the future sustainability of support systems.Younger Canadians appear focused on the cost of living, employment stability, and global relations, particularly as the economic fallout from US tariffs continues to ripple across industries. Older voters, meanwhile, are looking for reassurance that public healthcare and pension benefits will be protected and strengthened.All major parties have pledged to boost defence spending to meet NATO's 2% GDP target. The Liberals will invest C$18bn in new equipment like submarines and icebreakers, while Conservatives plan C$17bn and new Arctic bases. The NDP aims for the target by 2032 and would cancel US fighter jet contracts.On housing, Liberals promise a federal developer and C$25bn in financing to double housing starts. Conservatives want to build 2.3 million homes by tying funding to city performance and selling federal land. The NDP pledges 3 million affordable units and 100,000 rent-controlled homes.On climate, Liberals back industrial carbon pricing and clean energy investment. Conservatives would scrap all carbon pricing, while the NDP supports renewables and opposes new pipelines.Canada’s federal elections operate under a system similar to that of the United Kingdom. Citizens will cast a single vote for a local representative to the House of Commons. The candidate receiving the most votes in each constituency wins; a majority is not required. The leader of the party that wins the most seats is invited to form the government and becomes Prime Minister.If no party wins an outright majority, the leading party can attempt to form a minority government or build a coalition with smaller parties.Polling stations open across six time zones and will close mostly by 9:30 pm Eastern Daylight Time. Due to the vast geography of Canada, some ridings will have polls closing slightly later to ensure fairness.Ballots are hand-counted by federal officials under the supervision of party representatives. Most in-person votes will be counted at local polling places after polls close. Special ballots, such as those cast by military members, prisoners, and Canadians living abroad, are processed separately and may take longer.Elections Canada expects to have the ""vast majority"" of results available on election night. However, only preliminary figures will be released initially. Final official results, after thorough verification, typically take several days to be confirmed.Recounts are mandatory if the margin in any constituency is less than one one-thousandth of the votes cast.

Reiterating the views of other Pakistani minister, Naqvi demanded an independent probe into the incident.""Pakistan’s economic stability is intolerable for India,"" Naqvi said as quoted by The Express Tribune.

Normally, a crime scene is sealed off for several hours for investigation.""Naqvi accused the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) of being ""interconnected,"" asserting that evidence ties India to terrorist activities in Pakistan’s Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provinces.""We have proposed to India to conduct a transparent investigation into the Pahalgam and Jaffarabad incidents. We are ready to present evidence to a neutral committee,"" he said.Meanwhile, India has assured to bring the victims of the attack to justice and taken strong measures to curtail terrorist activities across the country. It has suspended the Indus Water Treaty, closed off its borders and cut off trade ties with Pakistan.","Pakistan interior minister Syed Mohsin Naqvi chose the country's economy as a tool to hit back at India after the latter accused it of being involved in the Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 people.

Overlooked letter shows Shakespeare was not a neglectful husband,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/overlooked-letter-shows-shakespeare-was-not-a-neglectful-husband/articleshow/120632792.cms,"NYT photo

Any clue about William Shakespeare's life usually excites scholars, but one piece of evidence had been neglected for decades. Now, a new analysis of that overlooked document seems to shatter a long-standing narrative about the Bard's bad marriage.Shakespeare was 18 in 1582 when he married Anne Hathaway, daughter of a family friend in Stratford-upon-Avon, in her mid-20s and pregnant. For centuries, it was thought he left his wife and children behind for a literary life in London, seeking to avoid ""the humiliation of domestic feuds"", as one 19th-century essayist put it. This view of Shakespeare's wife as a ""distant encumbrance"" suited scholars who thought ""Shakespeare was far too interesting to be a married guy,"" said Matthew Steggle, a professor at University of Bristol, England. The perception was bolstered by the fact that Shakespeare had left her his ""second best bed"" in his will. But Steggle's research, expected to be published this week in the journal Shakespeare, suggests the writer was not detached from his marriage after all.The hint lies in a fragment of a 17th-century letter addressing a ""Mrs Shakspaire,"" found in the binding of a book published in 1608. The letter was noted in 1978 by an amateur historian, but got minimal attention, even after the book was unbound in 2016, revealing what appeared to be part of a reply from Shakespeare's wife, Steggle said.If it really was addressed to Mrs Shakespeare, ""it is self-evidently remarkable,"" Steggle said - it offers new clues about their relationship, and suggests Mrs Shakespeare lived for a time in London with her husband. If she did live in London, she was possibly back in Stratford by the time she received the letter, around 1607 - though not necessarily because her husband wanted independence. Steggle says ""there is an obvious reason to avoid London in 1603-4, namely the very bad wave of plague"". Also, the upcoming arrival of their first grandchild after daughter Susanna's 1607 marriage ""would surely be a good time"" for Hathaway to be back in Stratford.Steggle says her movements should be reconsidered with an eye to her ""possible absences from London rather than her perpetual absence"". The letter concerned money for a fatherless child named John. It called upon her to pay money, most likely held in trust for him, a pledge her husband may have undertaken, and referred to a time when she ""dwelt in trinitie lane,"" which Steggle believes refers to a location in London.","William Shakespeare was 18 in 1582 when he married Anne Hathaway, daughter of a family friend.

"Why Annabel Elliot, Queen Camilla’s sister, refuses to curtsy her despite royal protocol",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/why-annabel-elliot-queen-camillas-sister-refuses-to-curtsy-her-despite-royal-protocol/articleshow/120612332.cms,"Annabel (L) and Camilla (R): AP file photos

Annabel Elliot , younger sister to the British Queen Camilla and official “companion” to her, has said she still cannot bring herself to curtsy to her elder sibling—even two decades after Camilla entered the royal family.The revelation came in a new Tatler profile written by royal biographer Robert Hardman to mark the 20th wedding anniversary of King Charles and Queen Camilla.Although royal customs have relaxed over time—and the official royal website says there are no compulsory gestures—curtsying remains common within the royal household. For most, especially insiders like Elliot who hold formal roles, such traditions are still followed.Elliot, an interior designer by profession, said the formality feels unnatural despite her sister’s royal status. “I think she’s transitioned beautifully, actually. I mean, I sometimes look at her, and I can’t really believe it,” she said, reflecting on Camilla’s journey from private citizen to Queen.While Elliot may skip the curtsy, her love and support for Camilla are unwavering. She has been described as the Queen’s emotional anchor, especially during a difficult year in 2024, which saw family health challenges and personal loss.In the BBC documentary Charles III: The Coronation Year, Elliot appeared visibly moved as she recalled watching her sister depart for Westminster Abbey in the golden coach. “It was quite a moment,” she said, recalling how surreal it felt to see someone she grew up with take the throne beside King Charles.",Annabel Elliot is the younger sister to the British Queen Camilla.
