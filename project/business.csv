India has been particularly affected by this issue and a large number of antiquities have been smuggled out of the country.During this visit of PM to US, 297 antiquities were handed over to India.This takes the total number of antiquities recovered by India since 2014 to 640.The total number of antiquities returned from the USA alone will be 578.Apart from the current visit, the earlier visits of PM to USA have also been particularly fruitful in return of antiquities to India. During PM Modi 's visit to the US in 2021, 157 antiquities were handed over by the US government, including the exquisite bronze Nataraja statue from the 12th century CE.

Hilsa: Cheers before Durga puja: Bangladesh to send 3000 tonnes of hilsa to India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cheers-before-durga-puja-bangladesh-to-send-3000-tonnes-of-hilsa-to-india/articleshow/113562731.cms,"KOLKATA/DHAKA: Fish traders in Kolkata had all but given up hope of importing “Padmar ilish” this year, in what seemed like the ultimate red herring due to the political upheaval in Bangladesh . But in a surprise move, the Muhammad Yunus-led interim govt announced on Saturday the approval of 3,000 tonnes of the prized hilsa fish for export to India just in time for Durga puja The announcement follows persistent requests from exporters in Bangladesh and Kolkata’s fish traders. Bangladesh, the world’s largest hilsa producer, remains keen to ensure domestic consumers still have access to the fish.The demand for fresh hilsa from Bangladesh is immense in Bengal. “Some traders are selling frozen hilsa from Myanmar, which lacks the taste of hilsa from the Padma-Meghna river system that connoisseurs in Bengal appreciate,” Fish Importers’ Association secretary Syed Anwar Maqsood said.The backdrop of this hilsa diplomacy is complex. Former PM Sheikh Hasina had banned the export of hilsa to India in 2012 after talks over the Teesta water-sharing agreement stalled. While Hasina lifted the ban before Durga puja in 2019, the new political landscape in Bangladesh had led many to believe that hilsa trade was unlikely to resume.The sudden change of heart sparked both excitement and confusion in Kolkata. “The order is likely to be issued on Sept 25, and the first consignment is expected to reach the city via the Benapole-Petrapole border the next day”, Maqsood said.Despite the large approved quantity, actual exports may fall short, with Maqsood adding that only around 1,500 tonne might reach India due to past trends. The trade window will remain open until Oct 22, before a 22-day hilsa fishing ban begins to allow the fish to lay eggs.Traders estimate prices in Kolkata market will hover between Rs 1,500-Rs 2,000 a kg, depending on the supply. Resumption of hilsa exports underscores importance of this fish in broader cultural and diplomatic relationship between Bangladesh and India. Whether the catch meets expectations remains to be seen, but return of hilsa diplomacy has again bridged borders in time for a festive celebration.","3,000 tonnes of the prized hilsa fish for export to India just in time for Durga puja.

Gene-therapy must be accessible to all: CJI,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gene-therapy-must-be-accessible-to-all-cji/articleshow/113562751.cms,"“Patient’s consent vital as gene-therapy in nascent stage”

NEW DELHI: Chief Justice of India D Y Chandrachud on Monday spoke passionately on the urgent need for universal access to gene therapy that helps correcting rare genetic disorders , a treatment which is exorbitantly costly and beyond the reach of most parents.Mixing his over 40 years’ experience in legal profession, 24 of which as a HC and SC judge, with a decade long emotional attachment with his adopted girls afflicted with genetic disorder, the CJI virtually spoke for thousands of parents battling to provide their children a future better than what stars had foretold.Delivering the inaugural address at “Gene Therapy & Precision Medicine Conference” at Bengaluru, Justice Chandrachud said, “The quest to treat rare diseases is futile if access to these treatments remains a challenge, especially outside major urban centres”.He said factors outside the healthcare system such as class, caste, gender and regional location often play a significant role in determining an individual’s health status and asserted that access to essential treatments is part of the right to health guaranteed under right to life.At the core of impeding universal access to gene therapy is its exorbitant cost. “Approved gene therapies in the West range from Rs 7 to 30 crores per treatment, making them unaffordable for most in India... Consequently, many families resort to crowdfunding to access this critical treatment,” he said.While appreciating the govt efforts to provide insurance cover for such treatments up to Rs 50 lakhs, the CJI said effective addressing of the situation could only be through development of indigenous technologies tailored for our patient population.Societal awareness of genetic disorders is essential for the socio-cultural support base for such patients, the CJI said. For developing cost-effective gene therapy, he said, “The industry must step up its support through Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives or direct investment in startups. To encourage more industry participation, there should be proposals for tax incentives and benefits, especially since the market for rare disease treatments is relatively small.”Lastly, he said for genetic therapy clinical trials, the fundamental right of a person to decide whether to undergo such treatment must not be ignored. “It is crucial that patients are fully informed about potential outcomes, risks, and alternatives. They must have the freedom to make decisions about their health without coercion, ensuring that their autonomy is always respected,” he said.","Chief Justice of India D Y Chandrachud spoke passionately on the urgent need for universal access to gene therapy that helps correcting rare genetic disorders.

Will Supreme Court be able to restrain over-speaking HC/SC judges?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/will-sc-be-able-to-restrain-over-speaking-hc/sc-judges/articleshow/113562669.cms,"Guidelines being advisory in nature, difficult to implement

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court ’s attempt to draw restraint boundaries for over-speaking judges while taking exception to a Karnataka HC judge’s uncalled-for remarks may not yield desired impact as its breach would not attract any drastic consequences, unlike the one faced almost a century ago by English Judge Hippy Hallet .Hippy Hallet aka Sir Hugh Imbert Periam Hallett was an English attorney who had impressed all with his knowledge of law. He was appointed as a judge in 1939. To get to the core of the disputes, he used to incessantly interrupt arguing counsel to ask questions, often making them flounder in presenting the case coherently.In one case - Jones vs National Coal Board [1957 (2) Queen's Bench 55] - he was so overbearing in his questions that both sides appealed against the verdict on identical grounds – the judge’s interruptions made it impossible for the counsel to put arguments properly.The SC Collegium would have rated a judge like Hallet highly for probing away to reach the truth in a case and would have laughed at the predicament of lawyers put to such a situation by the judge. Not in England.Justice Hallett's judgment was set aside. A fresh trial was ordered. The appeal judgment quoted Lord Chancellor Bacon, ""Patience and gravity of hearing is an essential part of justice; and an over-speaking judge is no well-tuned cymbal.""The English judiciary was so sensitive to this issue that the then Lord Chancellor sent for Justice Hallet and arranged that he could continue to sit for some time and then resign. Lord Alfred Thompson Denning, who set aside Justice Hallett's judgment, bemoaned the abrupt end to the judge's career.He said, ""It was a poignant case; for he was able and intelligent - but he asked too many questions."" What was an isolated instance in England has become a general practice in India. This over-speaking nature of a few judges, who are able and intelligent, is chipping away at the carefully crafted dignity of the judiciary.Coming back to the guidelines, the SC can at best caution or admonish a HC judge for breaching the advisory code of conduct in the courtroom. Will the guidelines be applicable to an HC judge’s speech at seminars or at conferences? Probably not.Recently a SC Judge, upset over a certain yoga guru’s conduct, had remarked “We will rip you apart”. Will the to-be-framed guidelines be applicable to a SC Judge?If a judge repeatedly violates the guidelines for courtroom observations and continues to indulge in irrational over-speaking, could it be regarded as misbehaviour or incapacity warranting his removal?For the CJI to recommend removal of a SC or HC judge under Article 124(4) of the Constitution, there must be inquiry headed by a panel of judges who would have to give a report proving the misbehaviour or incapacity of the concerned judge and recommend against his continue in the constitutional post.On receiving such a report, the CJI would have to decide forwarding the same to the government for initiation of removal motion under Article 124(4) in Parliament, which motion must receive support of two-third of the members present and voting in each House.Are the SC and CJI ready to take Hippy Hallet type of drastic action against HC and SC judges? There are over 1,000 HC judges in the country. Would social media be the guiding light for initiation of action against over-speaking judges or the concerned HC Chief Justice?If a constitutional post holder does not realize the dignity attached to the post he holds, no amount of guidelines would help bring sanity or balance in their observations.","Hippy Hallet aka Sir Hugh Imbert Periam Hallett was an English attorney who had impressed all with his knowledge of law.

"'Tirupati laddu ghee had pig & beef fat, fish oil': Row rages in Andhra Pradesh; TDP, YSRCP lock horns",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/tirupati-laddu-row-lab-reports-confirm-lard-tallow-in-ghee-supplied-for-tirumala/articleshow/113499408.cms,"TIRUPATI: The TDP govt in Andhra Pradesh on Thursday made public laboratory analysis of the cow ghee samples supplied to the Tirumala temple trust for making its famous Tirupati laddu prasadam during the term of the YSRC govt . It revealed the presence of foreign fats including lard (clarified pig fat), tallow (beef fat) and fish oil.SEE ALSO: '3 lakh laddus daily, Rs 500 crore revenue annually': Tirupati's sacred sweet takes a sour turn after ghee adulteration charges The samples also contained fats from vegetable sources like coconut, linseed, rapeseed and cottonseed.The analysis was conducted on July 23 after the government received complaints of change in taste of the laddu prasadam.Chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu had sparked a major controversy on Wednesday when he told NDA allies that animal fat had been found in the ghee for the laddus when YSRC was in power. YSRC had reacted angrily, denying the allegations and claiming it to be one of Naidu’s political stunts.The analysis by the Centre for Analysis and Learning in Livestock and Food (CALF) of the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB), however comes with a caveat - there can be chances of false positive results in certain circumstances. The report lists several conditions where a result could go wrong, including in cases like overfeeding cows with feed rich in vegetable oils, underfeeding cows or the milk being subjected to technological treatments like removal of cholesterol.The report is silent whether the adulterants were deliberately added or crept in through feeding conditions and other factors.Naidu’s allegation and the NDDB’s report have shocked millions of devotees of Lord Venkateswara across the globe as the Tirupati laddus are considered Maha Prasadam and carry a high sentimental value.The TDP govt had in June appointed senior IAS officer J Syamala Rao as the new executive officer of the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) which manages the temple complex. As part of streamlining measures, an inquiry was ordered into the alleged poor quality, taste and texture of the laddus.TTD constituted an expert committee to look into the quality of the prasadam. The members included Dr B Surendranth, former principal scientist of the National Dairy Research Institute, Vijayawada, Bhaskar Reddy (dairy expert), Prof B Mahadevan (IIM-Bangalore) and Dr G Swarnalatha from the Telangana Veterinary UniversityApart from suggesting several measures to TTD to restore the taste and quality, the committee also sent samples of the ghee to NDDB, Gujarat. The lab reports, issued in July, confirmed the presence of foreign fats. TTD returned the ghee stocks supplied by AR Dairy Foods, Dindigul, in Tamil Nadu and blacklisted the contractor. Then, TTD selected Karnataka Milk Federation to supply the ghee.TTD sources said that while cow ghee was procured from the blacklisted contractor at Rs 320 per kg, the Tirupati trust is now procuring ghee at Rs 475 per kg from the Karnataka federation.TTD prepares and distributes about 3 lakh laddus to the devotees every day at Tirumala. Every year, the trust earns around Rs 500 crore from laddu sales alone.","The TDP govt in Andhra Pradesh made public laboratory analysis of the cow ghee samples supplied to the Tirumala temple trust for making its famous Tirupati laddu prasadam.

This request came amidst uncertainty surrounding the shipments of the fish this year, following recent unrest and a change in government in Bangladesh.In a letter dated September 9, the Association's secretary, Syed Anwar Maqsood, highlighted that although Bangladesh implemented a ban onhilsa export in 2012, the country has been allowing limited exports from the first week of September until the end of the Durga Puja festival for the past five years as a gesture of goodwill.As the leading global producer of hilsa, Bangladesh typically imposes restrictions on the export of this fish to meet the high domestic demand. However, during the Durga Puja festivities, the country usually eases the export ban on hilsa.The practice of allowing hilsa exports to India between September and October each year, as a gesture of goodwill, had been a long-standing tradition under the previous Awami League government, led by the deposed prime minister Sheikh Hasina.","Bangladesh will export 3,000 tonnes of Hilsa during the upcoming Durga Puja festival, which will take place from October 9 to 13.

NEW DELHI: After reports of beef fat and fish oil being found in the cow ghee samples used to make the Tirupati 'laddu prasadam ,' Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams said that sanctity of the 'prasadam' has been restored.

The acceptable S-value range for pure milk fat is between 98.05 and 104.32, but the tested samples showed values ranging from 23.22 to 116, indicating significant deviations.""""The lack of an in-house lab for ghee testing allowed suppliers to take advantage of the situation.

Significantly, it also appointed chief justice of Jharkhand HC, for which the state had moved a contempt plea against the Centre in SC .President has signed the warrants of appointment for the chief justices of Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, Meghalaya, Himachal Pradesh, Kerala, Madras, Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh and Jharkhand.Govt's quick decision would perhaps ensure that differences between executive and judiciary on the issue of appointments in the higher judiciary do not snowball into tug-of-war as witnessed in judicial proceedings last year when SC expressed its deep displeasure over the Centre not adhering to the law. It had said the collegium system for appointment of judges was the law of the land and the Centre was bound to follow it and in case of reiteration, govt has no option but to accept the collegium's decision.Govt has appointed acting chief justice of Delhi HC Justice Manmohan as its chief justice. Delhi HC judge Justice Rajiv Shakdher has been appointed as chief justice of Himachal Pradesh HC. Another Delhi HC judge, Justice Suresh Kait will take charge as chief justice of Madhya Pradesh HC.

Some of the issues raised by SC last year also remain unaddressed including the transfer of some HC judges and clearing those names which were reiterated by the SC collegium for HC judgeship. The delay and the Centre's policy of ""pick and choose"" from the collegium's recommendation is also a bone of contention between the two organs of governance and the court in its judicial proceedings repeatedly flagged the issue.SC had in 2021 framed comprehensive guidelines for time-bound appointment of judges and fixed the time period for all authorities involved in the process to take decision. It had said the Intelligence Bureau (IB) should submit its report/inputs within 4-6 weeks from the date of recommendation of HC collegium to the Centre, which should forward the file to SC within 8-12 weeks from the date of receipt of views from the state and IB report. The CJI , thereafter, would send recommendations/advice to the law minister within four weeks. The Centre would make the appointment immediately or it can send the recommendation back for reconsideration and if the names are reiterated then they should be appointed within 3-4 weeks.The apex court had last reiterated that govt could bring-in a new system by passing law but had said that ""no system can be perfect"". It had said the present situation of delay in appointment was not healthy and it discouraged meritorious lawyers from accepting judgeship.","President has signed the warrants of appointment for the chief justices of Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, Meghalaya, Himachal Pradesh, Kerala, Madras, Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh and Jharkhand.

But in a surprise move, the Muhammad Yunus-led interim govt announced on Saturday the approval of 3,000 tonne of the prized hilsa fish for export to India just in time for Durga puja The announcement follows persistent requests from exporters in Bangladesh and Kolkata's fish traders. Bangladesh, the world's largest hilsa producer, remains keen to ensure domestic consumers still have access to the fish.The demand for fresh hilsa from Bangladesh is immense in Bengal. ""Some traders are selling frozen hilsa from Myanmar, which lacks the taste of hilsa from the Padma-Meghna river system that connoisseurs in Bengal appreciate,"" Fish Importers' Association secretary Syed Anwar Maqsood said.The backdrop of this hilsa diplomacy is complex. Former PM Sheikh Hasina had banned the export of hilsa to India in 2012, after talks over Teesta water-sharing agreement stalled. While Hasina lifted the ban before Durga puja in 2019, the new political landscape in Bangladesh had led many to believe that hilsa trade was unlikely to resume.Traders estimate prices in Kolkata market will hover between Rs 1,500-Rs 2,000 a kg, depending on the supply. Resumption of hilsa exports underscores importance of this fish in broader cultural and diplomatic relationship between Bangladesh and India. Whether the catch meets expectations remains to be seen, but return of hilsa diplomacy has again bridged borders in time for a festive celebration.","Bangladesh approves 3,000 tonne of the prized hilsa fish for export to India.

The boy who could do no wrong

KOZHIKODE: A man from Wayanad who briefly trained for the clergy before migrating to Norway in search of greener pastures has emerged as an alleged link in the sensational pager explosions in Lebanon on Tuesday that targeted Hezbollah fighters and killed 12 people, including civilians, and injured dozens.Norta Global Ltd, based in Sofia, Bulgaria - allegedly owned by Rinson Jose (37) of Wayanad, now a Norwegian citizen - is being probed by international security agencies following reports linking it to the sale of hundreds of pagers.Central intelligence agencies and Kerala Police special branch collected details on Friday about Rinson from his native village, Ondayangadi, near Mananthavady, Wayanad. Wayanad district police chief Taposh Basumathary said police had done a normal background check. ""Now that the identity and details of the family have come out in the media, police have taken steps to ensure they are safe. We are patrolling the area,"" he said.Family sources said Rinson, son of Moothedath Jose and Gracy, who used to work as tailors, had gone abroad with his twin brother, who now works in the UK. His sister is a nurse in Ireland. He lives in Norway with his wife and had last come home in Nov 2023 and returned in Jan 2024.""Rinson last spoke to his family here three days ago. They haven't been able to contact him on the phone since. We tried calling Rinson's wife on Friday as well, but no one answered. The news reports about him are unbelievable; he could also have been deceived,"" Rinson's uncle, Thankachan, told TOI.Hungarian media reported that Norta Global had facilitated the sale of the pagers. The firm's website - which described it as a leading technology company with strong focus on consulting, technology and payment integration, recruitment & outsourcing - has been taken down now.However, Bulgaria's State Agency for National Security said that Norta Global and its owner had ""not carried out any transaction linked to the sale or purchase of the merchandise"" or that which ""falls under laws on terrorism financing"".Reuters had reported on Thursday that Norta's Bulgarian headquarters was registered at an apartment building near Sofia that was also home to nearly 200 other companies, but there was no sign of Norta.Reuters said Rinson declined to comment on the pagers when reached by phone and hung up when asked about the Bulgarian business.Amund Djuve, the CEO of DN Media, where Jose currently works, told Reuters he was aware of the reports and had alerted police and security services. He said that Jose was travelling to the US.Oslo Police said it had initiated ""preliminary enquiries into the information that had come to light"". Norway's domestic intelligence agency, PST, said it was aware of the situation and declined to comment further, Reuters reported.According to Rinson's LinkedIn page, he has been working in the Oslo-based DN Media Group in Norway for nearly five years and was involved in leading digitisation, automation, and growth across multiple brands/publications. Besides mentioning him as an entrepreneur running NortaLink, an IT service, consultancy, procurement, and recruiting company from 2016 onwards, it identifies him as co-founder of an IT recruiting and business development firm and IT recruitment firm StarCruiter. Rinson had pursued a master's in international social welfare and health policy at Oslo Metropolitan University from 2012 to 2015. The profile also claims he was general secretary of International Students Union of Norway for one year from Sept 2012.In Ondayangadi, residents of the area said they knew Rinson as an upright person, while his shocked family members said they were sure he would not do anything wrong. Rinson's uncle, Thankachan, said Rinson studied at Ondayangadi school, then went to a seminary for a year, and later continued his studies in Wayanad and Bengaluru. He had worked at a call centre in Bengaluru and acquired an MBA from Pondicherry in 2010 before heading to Norway for higher studies. He said he didn't know of Rinson owning a company there. ""He was an employee at an organisation... The family is not that well off.

""At least nine innocent tribals have been shot dead and dozens injured at Khagarachari while over 100 houses and shops have been burnt at Dighinala Sadar,"" the Chakma leaders said in the memorandum.The memorandum stated that on September 12 the Prothom Alo had reported attacks and damages to at least 1,090 houses, business establishments and places of worship belonging to the minority communities between August 5 and 20 after the fall of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s government. The leaders said that the attacks were being carried out in order to counter the growing use of the democratic space by the hill people and drive out the hill tribes out of the CHTs.On Thursday, the indigenous hill tribe students had organised “March For Identity” at Khagrachari under the banner of “Sanghat O Boishamyo Birodhi Pahari Chhatra Andolan” (Anti Conflict & Discrimination Tribal Students Movement) demanding recognition of their rights and guarantee for distinct identities. About 40,000 tribals had participated in the march.The Chittagong Hill Tracts was a tribal dominated area and despite having 98.5% non-Muslims, the Bengal Boundary Commission awarded the region to Pakistan during the partition of India in 1947. From 1979 to 1983, then Pakistan President General Ziaur Rahman implanted about 5,00,000 illegal plain settlers belonging to Muslim faith to reduce indigenous peoples of the CHTs into a minority on their own land.

Expanding Air India's punctuality woes leave flyers frustrated,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/expanding-air-indias-punctuality-woes-leave-flyers-frustrated/articleshow/113562007.cms,"NEW DELHI: ""Set your watches boys, we are right on schedule."" A beaming J R D Tata had remarked when Air India 's (AI) maiden international flight, which left Bombay on June 8, 1948, for London via Cairo and Geneva, reached its destination the next day. That's folklore for AI passengers now, especially those taking its USP medium to ultra long hauls, due to frequent long delays.While nobody expected miracles within two-and-a-half years of the airline returning to founder Tata Group in Jan 2022 after nearly seven decades as a PSU, AI's poor on time performance (OTP) is now irking and inconveniencing passengers who prefer not to look at their watches on delayed flights.Vistara, which was more punctual, will be merged into AI on Nov 12.Sample this: On Aug 31, 2024, Mumbai-London AI 129 left nearly nine hours after its scheduled departure time of 5.15am. The same day, Mumbai-New York (JFK) left after a 12-hour delay. AI 129, flight tracking sites show, left after 2pm on Aug 28, 29 and 30. And on Aug 23 and 24, it left after 8am. The list of delays is an endless one. A flight operating within 15 minutes of its scheduled departure/arrival time is considered on time.AI's domestic punctuality is also in the pits. Only struggling-to-survive SpiceJet and Alliance Air have seen worse OTP than it in recent months, as per DGCA data (see box). But passengers have options on domestic routes. AI's domestic market share in CY 2023 was 9.7%. International, however, is another story. AI offers the maximum medium to ultra long haul nonstops to North America, Europe, Far East and Australia.On many routes like Delhi-Chicago/San Francisco (SFO)/Washington; Mumbai-New York/SFO and Bengaluru-SFO, AI is the only direct service. For North America, AI direct flights are the fastest option as the airline overflies Russia and takes the shortest route. Delay of these flights is testing the patience of the loyal customer base of diaspora and Indian globetrotters that are so crucial for the airline.According to OAG, the top three airlines for international capacity share from India in April 2024 were Air India (20%), IndiGo (17%) and Emirates (7%).Comments were sought from AI on its international flight delays - why they are happening with such regularity and what is being about the same - and were awaited till the time of going to press.Recently, DGCA had to intervene after three back-to-back really long delays this summer: Mumbai-SFO AI 179 of May 24 by 18 hours; Delhi-SFO of May 30 by over 30 hours and June 1 Delhi-Vancouver by over 20 hours. ""AI is time and again failing in taking due care of passengers,"" the DGCA notice at that time said. DGCA does not give OTP figures for international flights.TOI spoke to a cross section of stakeholders to find out the reason for AI's poor performance. The common reasons - engineering and maintenance issues that are leading to poor technical dispatch reliability; frequent grounding of aircraft due to snags; spare shortage and poor crew planning.""In this backdrop, AI has bitten off more than it can chew in terms of having so many flights which it cannot operate without frequent delays or seeing cancellations. They are over-sweating the planes,"" said sources. AI has both added a number of international flights.Multiple stakeholders spoke about a management disconnect with the ground realities and the new managers not taking the legacy team along. ""They have antagonised the old key employees and keep criticising them. So many long-time employees now feel disconnected. Everything is on multiple apps and emails. If something is to be reported, do so by email. A reply may come a few days later,"" said multiple people.Even AI insiders admit that these issues will not get resolved just by inducting new aircraft. AI Engineering Services Ltd (AIESL) was hived off when AI was privatised. ""Systems and processes have to be in place. Our long hauls operate on the edge of the maximum carrying capacity and limit of aircraft. Even a small issue means leaving passengers or baggage behind; delaying or cancelling flights. Bombay House (Tata HQ) is seized of the matter; is watching the situation closely and is asking the questions that need to be asked,"" they said.","Air India's poor on time performance (OTP) is now irking and inconveniencing passengers. Only struggling-to-survive SpiceJet and Alliance Air have seen worse OTP than it in recent months. Vistara, which was more punctual, will be merged into AI on Nov 12.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113562007,imgsize-12814,width-400,resizemode-4/113562007.jpg"

"Online system of reporting problems, rectification of NHs made round-the-year exercise",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nhai-makes-online-report-rectify-portal-a-round-the-year-drill/articleshow/113561678.cms,"Recent drive found 12,795 defects in 37k km of NHs

NEW DELHI: Facing flak over increased instances of damaged stretches, potholes and deformed road signs due to incessant rain, the NHAI has made its online system of reporting problems and recording their rectification a round-the-year exercise by making contractors accountable. Recently, it carried out a two-week long special drive for inspection of 37,000 km of NHs and field inspections found 12,795 defects, including potholes and damaged stretches, crash barriers and signage.While nearly 68% (8,900) of these have been rectified so far, in several cases NHAI is imposing fines on contractors.A top NHAI official said that they used an in-house mobile app to get the exact status of roads and progress of repair, and also for holding the contractors responsible for poor maintenance. The highways authority has decided to take the personnel deployed in highway patrol vans to record and report any damage to highway stretches or other issues through the app for quick action since they are always on the designated corridors.“We used the app not just to collect the details of defects. Once a defect is reported, an instant notification is sent to the contractor’s team through the app. They can view the defect location, photo, and any additional remarks. Each defect has a live countdown timer based on its contractual rectification timeline. After contractors reported rectification, these are verified by authority or independent engineers before closing them,” the official said.He added that if the independent engineers find the defect has not been satisfactorily closed, they can reject it on the app itself.Officials said that for pending defects, the system tracks those beyond their contractual deadlines, and the NHAI has issued instructions to project directors to enforce notices or assign the work to alternative contractors if necessary. “In certain contract types, the system automatically calculates penalties for delays and applies them to contractors’ online bills,” said one of them.Depending on the type of defect, contractors or concessionaires have specific timelines to address them. For example, potholes must be repaired within 48 hours; deformed road signs to be replaced within 2-3 days; damaged metal beam crash barriers fixed in seven days, and cracks addressed within 15 days. “In total, 90 types of operation and maintenance defects are monitored for comprehensive highway maintenance.","The NHAI has made its online system of reporting problems and recording their rectification a round-the-year exercise.

BJP spreading lies, says Rahul, stands by his remarks on Sikhs

With posters attacking PM Narendra Modi circulating in the US on the day he reached there, BJP attacked Rahul Gandhi for the campaign linking it to leader of opposition's recent visit to the country.Dubbing the posters as creations of ""anti-India hate shop"", BJP spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi said, ""There is suspicion among Indians that if it is an outcome of Rahul Gandhi's warm meetings with the established and sponsored anti-India groups there as he has returned from the US only a few days back.Or is it the same group which was facilitating meetings of these pawns of anti-India forces with Rahul Gandhi,"" he said in a statement.The poster, shared by BJP IT cell head Amit Malviya on X, reads, ""Protest: Modi, You're Not Welcome in New York"" and calls on people to ""raise your voice against a decade of oppression."" A demonstration is planned for Sunday, September 22, at the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Long Island.Trivedi said what is painful about the ""low blow"" from this ""nafrat ki dukan"" (hate shop) is that it is directed at a Prime Minister who took India to among the five top economies from 'Fragile Five', lifted over 26 crore people out of extreme poverty, turned the country into a pioneer in digital revolution and strengthened its internal and external security. The frustration arising from India's growing power and acceptance is born out of jealousy and nervousness, Trivedi said. ""This is an objectionable poster,"" Trivedi said. ""It is a hate advertisement and it is beyond doubt that Congress leader Rahul Gandhi got the meeting and support of those forces who are declared enemies of India...""Malviya said Gandhi's overseas engagements have consistently been detrimental to India's image. ""Every time Rahul Gandhi goes abroad, he indulges in the most divisive anti-India politics, including hobnobbing with agencies and collaborating with forces inimical to India's interest. He has gone to the extent of pleading with western powers to interfere in Indian politics.""Leader of opposition in the Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi justified his recent remarks in the US that the ""fight"" in India is not about politics but whether a Sikh is allowed to wear turban and kada, and can visit gurdwara and all are free to practice their religion without fear.His post on X, an assertion that he does not regret his remarks, came after the BJP cited a joint statement of various Sikh groups to ask Rahul to withdraw his statement.Rahul said, ""The BJP has been spreading lies about my remarks in America. I want to ask every Sikh brother and sister in India and abroad - is there anything wrong in what I have said? Shouldn't India be a country where every Sikh - and every Indian - can freely practice their religion without fear?""He added, ""They are desperate to silence me because they cannot stand the truth... but I will always speak up for the values that define India: our unity in diversity, equality, and love.""At a gathering of Indian-Americans in Herndon, a Virginia suburb of Washington DC, Gandhi recently said, ""first of all, you have to understand what the fight is about. The fight is not about politics. That is superficial."" In the clip, Gandhi then asked a Sikh man sitting among the audience: ""what is your name, brother with the turban?""After the man shared his name, Gandhi said: ""The fight is about whether he, as a Sikh, is going to be allowed to wear his turban in India or he, as a Sikh, is going to be allowed to wear a 'kada' in India. Or he, as a Sikh, is going to be able to go to a gurdwara. That's what the fight is about. And not just for him, for all religions"".""And what the RSS is basically saying is that certain states are inferior to other states, certain languages are inferior to other languages, certain religions are inferior to other religions and certain communities are inferior to other communities. This is what the fight is about,"" Gandhi added.","Posters attacking PM Narendra Modi circulating in the US on the day he reached there.

The phased implementation begins with classes 1, 3, 5, 8, and 11 in the academic year of 2025-26.

All vernacular schools to adopt semi-English mode



MUMBAI: Maharashtra govt is set to adopt National Council for Educational Research and Training (NCERT) textbooks for mathematics and science in state board schools from the next academic year, reports Sandhya Nair.The decision was taken in a meeting with officials, principals and teacher representatives, where school education minister Deepak Kesarkar emphasised the growing demand for CBSE schools due to their focus on preparing students for competitive exams .CBSE schools use NCERT texts.The texts will be introduced in a phased manner, starting with classes 1, 3, 5, 8, and 11 in 2025-26. For History and Geography, the curriculum will remain the same, with a few additions from the NCERT-prescribed course.Maharashtra govt’s decision to introduce NCERT readers for maths and science will make all non-English medium schools adopt a semiEnglish mode of education as textbooks for the two subjects will be available only in English. However, Marathi will continue to be a mandatory language for all schools and standards up to class 12.The transition from the current Balbharati course work to NCERT textbooks is planned to coincide with the introduction of theNational Education Policy in school education next year. The State Curriculum Framework for School Education (SCF-SE) is also in its final stages, despite occasional criticism such as the inclusion of a controversial verse from the ancient text Manusmriti in a draft released in May.Reacting to the decision, Fr. Flovi Dsouza, principal of Don Bosco School Borivali, noted the high demand for CBSE schools and the benefits of NCERT textbooks in prepa ring for competitive exams. State board teachers pointed out that the govt had previously lowered the difficulty level of its textbooks to help students score well in board exams. Veena Donwalkar, principal of Shivaji Vidyalaya, emphasized the need for teacher training if NCERT textbooks are introduced. However, anot her CBSE school principal questioned the relevance of using NCERT texts now that competitive exams are conducted by the National Testing Agency instead of CBSE. A principal from an Andheri school recalled discussions undertaken in 2009 for introducing NCERT textbooks to state schools, and said the books were then found to be too challenging for ""academically weak"" children.CBSE has encouraged the use of NCERT textbooks for class 1 to 8. In Aug, CBSE made it compulsory for its schools to use NCERT texts for class 9 to 12 from this year. Previously, schools had a choice to prescribe either NCERT or books by private publishers for all classes. NCERT texts are being revamped in line with the NEP.","NCERT will be introduced in a phased manner, starting with classes 1, 3, 5, 8, and 11 in 2025-26.

The initiatives will help in developing the sector and increasing milk production to meet the domestic demand and also tap the export potential,” said the official.The ‘cooperation among cooperatives’ initiative has three key components including distribution of Rupay - Kisan Credit Cards to dairy farmers, distribution of micro-ATM to dairy cooperatives and opening of the account of the cooperative societies and their members in cooperative banks.“Its SOP has been finalised on the basis of experiences gained in pilot projects in Panchmahal and Banaskantha districts of Gujarat,” said a cooperation ministry official.Referring to the move of opening the account of the cooperative societies and their members in cooperative banks, he said, “This will ensure that money of the cooperative sector remains in the cooperative banking system, leading to an enhanced corpus of deposits in the cooperative banks. This will, in turn, empower cooperative banks to lend more money to the cooperative sector at affordable interest rates, leading to enhanced economic activities in the sector.”",Amit Shah will on Thursday launch multiple initiatives including the cooperative-led White Revolution 2.0 to transform the dairy sector.

Modi is expected to brief Biden in detail about his recent meetings with both Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Ukraine counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy.""Talks are ongoing between the leaders. As for putting forward any proposal, we'll have to see how much consensus is reached and whether we can reach a stage where a proposal can be put before a larger audience. So, I think we need to wait a little,"" said foreign secretary Vikram Misri, when asked if India will come up with a specific peace proposal either at the UN, where the PM will address the summit of the future, or in the engagements in Delaware. While seeking peace proactively, India has not budged from its original position that it won’t mediate directly or propose any peace formula of its own.On the IPEF, Misri said India will be formally joining the additional pillars, while negotiations for India’s participation in the trade pillar continue. IPEF, which comprises 14 Indo-Pacific countries as members, aims to strengthen economic cooperation for advancing growth and prosperity in the region. It’s structured around 4 pillars – trade, supply chains, clean economy and fair economy in that order. India is yet to join the trade pillar. ""We are joining pillars 3 and 4 and the overarching agreement, an administrative arrangement on how things will move forward. So, at the end of this exercise, we would have done 2, 3, 4 and the overarching agreement.

Asked if he would meet former president Donald Trump or Bangladesh Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus at the UNGA in New York, Misri said meetings are still being scheduled, keeping in mind time available.Modi will arrive on September 22 in New York, where he will participate in a technology roundtable with CEOs and also address an Indian diaspora event.

Her sudden death has sparked nationwide concern.Ann Mariya, a school friend from Rajagiri Public School, remembered Anna as a bright student and a perfectionist. Yet, Anna had called her friends in Pune, breaking down over the phone.Another friend, Ann Treasa Joseph, recalled how Anna would call her mother in tears almost every day.""Anita Aunty often said how overwhelmed Anna was with work at EY. Even at night, she was assigned tasks. During a visit home after four months, Anna confided that she was considering quitting due to stress. She felt isolated without close friends in Pune and was trying to transfer to EY Kochi. Her mother kept advising her to leave if it became too toxic,"" said Ann Treasa, according to a report published in Onmanorama.Mariya, another close friend, recounted their last conversation just two hours before Anna’s death, where Anna shared her struggles with work-related stress. ""She was planning to resign, and her parents fully supported her decision. She had raised concerns with HR but was met with indifference. Neither her manager nor assistant manager showed any empathy towards her health. Even Anna’s mother tried reaching out to them but got no response,"" Mariya recalled, citing a report from Onmanorama.The report further mentioned that Anna had experienced anxiety attacks, yet no one stepped forward to help.In a letter to Rajiv Memani, the firm’s India chief, Anna’s mother, Anita Augustine, alleged that her daughter, a chartered accountant, died of cardiac arrest caused by excessive workload. Anita emphasized that this issue isn't just about Anna, but about the unrealistic pressures faced by many young IT professionals today.According to Anna's parents, she had no prior medical conditions before joining Ernst & Young on March 18 this year. They believe that the excessive workload, including tasks outside regular office hours, led to her untimely death on July 21.""Anna was always a fighter,"" her mother, Anita, wrote in a letter to EY India’s chief.""From childhood through her academic years, she excelled in everything she did. She was a school and college topper, excelled in extracurricular activities, and passed her CA exams with distinction.

When the Kansas City Chiefs snagged Tyreek Hill in the fifth round of the 2016 NFL Draft, they didn’t just get a player—they secured a game-changer. Hill’s football journey took him from Garden City to Oklahoma State and finally to West Alabama, where he refined his exceptional talent.Initially known as a return specialist, this former track and field standout quickly transitioned into an explosive wide receiver.His jaw-dropping speed earned him the nickname ""Cheetah"" right after his rookie year, making him a formidable force on the field and a nightmare for defenders.But Hill’s success isn’t just measured in touchdowns; it also reflects in his impressive net worth . Let’s take a closer look at how this dynamic athlete has built his financial legacy alongside his remarkable career.Also Read: Kelce-ing It Real: Travis celebrates Taylor Swift in style at Game Day In March 2022, Tyreek Hill made headlines when he signed a staggering four-year, $120 million contract with the Miami Dolphins , making him the highest-paid wide receiver in the NFL at that time. This lucrative deal significantly contributed to his estimated net worth of around $40 million.Fast forward to the 2024 season, and Hill is back in the spotlight, having successfully renegotiated his contract. His new three-year agreement is worth $90 million, including an impressive $54 million guaranteed, with some funds pushed into the future.Tyreek Hill has officially inked a lucrative 3-year, $90 million contract with the Miami Dolphins. The deal features a hefty $7 million signing bonus and $59 million guaranteed, making for an average annual salary of $30 million. In 2024, Hill is set to earn a total compensation of $25.25 million, which breaks down to a base salary of $1.21 million along with a whopping $24.04 million signing bonus. A game-changing payday.Tyreek Hill began his athletic journey at Garden City Community College in Kansas before transferring to Oklahoma State University in 2014. His time at OSU ended prematurely due to a domestic abuse arrest, though he made his mark by leading the nation in combined return yards. In September 2015, he joined the University of West Alabama, excelling as a versatile player across multiple positions, including wide receiver and kick returner.In addition to endorsing Grip Boost Inc., Hill invested in the company back in 2020 and even created his own signature glove. His standout Yellow Peace Football Gloves let wearers showcase his iconic “peace sign” gesture right on the palms. But that’s not all, Hill is also a co-owner of Soul Runner, adding yet another feather to his cap.In late 2019, Tyreek Hill purchased a spacious 7,562-square-foot home near Kansas City, later listing it for $1.3 million just a year later.He also showed off his Florida residence, featuring a quirky “Cheetah Cave” off-limits to his girlfriend, mom, and daughter, filled with memorabilia, a basketball hoop, and a pool table.The home includes a large gym, a pool, a Jacuzzi, and a Koi pond, along with a sand volleyball court in the works and a basketball court. Plus, there’s a separate home on the property for his mother.Tyreek Hill is not just a superstar on the field; he's also a passionate car enthusiast. His impressive collection includes a sleek Mercedes-Benz G350, two eye-catching Corvettes, a stylish Galaxy, and a powerful Escalade. Plus, he’s got a Stinger to round out his dream garage.(Source Credit: Pinkvilla and Sportskeeda)Also Read: Is benching Bryce Young the right call?

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.",Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job. Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.
